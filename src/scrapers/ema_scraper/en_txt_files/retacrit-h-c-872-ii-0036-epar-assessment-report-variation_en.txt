3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Erythropoietin,  a  glycosylated  protein  of  165  amino  acids  with  a  molecular  weight  of  approximately 
34,000 daltons, is an essential growth factor required for production of red blood cells. The stimulus for 
erythropoietin  production  is  believed  to  be  the  oxygen  content  of  blood  delivered  to  the  renal 
interstitial  cells.  When  the  peritubular  renal  cells  are  functioning  correctly,  individuals  with  low 
haemoglobin  concentrations  will  produce  increased  quantities  of  erythropoietin,  resulting  in  increased 
red blood cell production. 
Over  the  past  fifteen  years  it  has  been  shown  in  several  trials  that  genetically  engineered 
erythropoietin  (epoetin)  administered  to  anaemic  chronic  renal  failure  patients  resulted  in  clinically 
significant increases in haemoglobin. Epoetin alfa, the first available recombinant human erythropoietin, 
has been given to treat anaemia due to chronic renal failure in patients on dialysis as well as in those 
not yet receiving dialysis. 
Epoetin  zeta  (Retacrit)  contains  a  recombinant  human  erythropoietin  (rhu-EPO,  ATC  code  BO3XA01), 
as active ingredient. Biosimilarity has been claimed to Epoetin alfa (Erypo) as the reference product.  
The currently approved indications of Retacrit in the European Union are: 
 
 
 
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and 
paediatric patients: 
o  Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric 
patients on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).   
o  Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult 
patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).   
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving 
chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of 
transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing 
anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).  
Retacrit can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation 
programme. Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of 
thromboembolic events. Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (no 
iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 
5 or more units for males).  
In  September  2009,  the  MAH  submitted  an  interim  report  for  a  comparative  clinical  trial  in  the 
maintenance  treatment  of  patients  with  renal  anaemia  using  the  subcutaneous  (SC)  route  of 
administration (Study 411-54-07-08-0000).  Based on these results, the addition of the SC route was 
approved for the indications of renal anaemia on 06 April 2010 (variation II-20).  
In  the  present  type  II  variation,  the  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  Study  411-54-07-08-0000  to 
support an extension of the current indication to include “Retacrit can be used to reduce exposure to 
allogeneic  blood  transfusions  in  adult  non-iron  deficient  patients  prior  to  major  elective  orthopaedic 
surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications. Use should be restricted to patients 
with moderate anaemia (e.g. Hb 10-13 g/dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme 
available and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1800 ml).”  
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.8 of the SmPC and sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet have 
been updated as a consequence. Annex II has been updated with the new version number of the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) and aligned in accordance with the latest version of the QRD template. Minor 
editorial changes have also been included.  
3.2 Clinical pharmacology 
For the purpose of this variation, no new pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic studies have been 
submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based  on  previously  submitted  pharmacokinetic  studies  (411-54-05-05-0000,  411-54-03-09-0001) 
which  were  evaluated  at  the  time  of  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application,  it  was  concluded 
that  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  after  a  single  intra-venous  (IV)  bolus  injection  of  10,000  IU  of 
Epoetin zeta and Epoetin alfa (Erypo) and after a single SC injection of 10,000 IU of Epoetin zeta and 
Epoetin  alfa  were  practically  identical.  Bioequivalence  was  demonstrated  for  Epoetin  zeta  within  the 
narrow  confidence  intervals  of  80-125%.  The  demonstration  of  bioequivalence  between  the  two  SC 
administered formulations is of major importance since this finding supports  the SC administration of 
Epoetin zeta in indications that are approved for SC use. 
3.3 Clinical efficacy 
Data  were  submitted  from  Study  411-54-07-08-0000,  in  which  the  efficacy  of  Epoetin  zeta 
administered  SC  for  maintenance  treatment  of  renal  anaemia  was  compared  to  Epoetin  alfa  (Erypo).  
The results have been previously assessed as part of variation II-20.

Treatments 
Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  Test  product  (Epoetin  zeta,  pre-filled  syringes,  STADA 
Arzneimittel,  AG,  Germany)  or  Reference  product  (Erypo,  epoetin  alfa  pre-filled  syringes,  JANSSEN-
CILAG GmbH, Germany). For each phase of the study, epoetin  was administered at the  unit dose of 
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 IU, 1-3 times weekly, sub-cutaneously, at the end of dialysis. 
Open Run-in Phase: 
The  trial  began  with  an  open  run-in  period  of  12-16  week  duration.  All  patients  received  a 
subcutaneous administration of Epoetin zeta.  
Main study phase: 
Treatment for 28 weeks with either the Test product or the Reference product. 
Follow-up extension phase: 
After the end of the main study phase, all patients could continue treatment for further 54 weeks with 
Epoetin zeta. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  trial  was  to  prove  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  Epoetin  zeta  to  a 
reference  product  Epoetin  alfa  administered  subcutaneously  for  maintaining  the  haemoglobin 
concentration in anaemic patients with end-stage renal failure on chronic haemodialysis. 
The secondary objective of the present trial was to gather data regarding the safety and tolerability of 
Epoetin  zeta  (with  particular  focus  on  the  formation  of  anti-epoetin  antibodies)  when  administered 
subcutaneously. 
The  aim  of  the  open  follow-up  extension  period  was  to  gather  data  regarding  the  long-term  safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of Epoetin zeta under open, non-controlled conditions. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints:  
  mean haemoglobin level during the last 4 weeks of treatment, 
  mean weekly epoetin dosage per kg body weight during the last 4 weeks of treatment.

Sample Size 
The planned sample size was 400 patients (200 per group), which was expected to give a >80% power 
for the two-sided proof of equivalence. A total number of 707 male and female patients with end-stage 
renal  failure  on  chronic  haemodialysis  were  screened  after  giving  their  consent  in  written  form.  After 
careful  consideration  of  all  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  28  patients  were  not  eligible  for  the  trial. 
Therefore, only 679 patients entered the open run-in treatment period with the test product (Epoetin 
zeta).  
Randomisation 
Patients  who  fulfilled  the  criterion  for  randomisation  (target  haemoglobin  within  the  range  between 
10.5-11.5  g/dl  with  constant  s.c.  Epoetin  zeta  dosage  and  without  an  intra-individual  change  in 
haemoglobin of more than 0.5 g/dl over 4 weeks) could be randomised to start the main study phase. 
Randomisation was performed in blocks; the block size was 6. 
After 12 to 18 weeks treatment (open run-in period), 462 patients were eligible to start observer-blind 
treatment  (main  study  phase)  and  were  randomised  to  one  of  both  study  drugs  (Epoetin  zeta  or 
Epoetin  alfa)  (safety  population)  at  an  unchanged  dose    as  reached  in  the  last  4  weeks  of  the  run-in 
period.  
Two  hundred  and  thirty-two  patients  were  allocated  to  the  test  medication  and  230  patients  to  the 
reference drug. Twelve patients (4 treated with test drug and 8 treated with the reference preparation) 
were  excluded  from  the  full  analysis  set  (n=450).  Further  131  patients  were  excluded  from  the  per 
protocol set due to major protocol deviations. Therefore, the per protocol set consists of 319 patients. 
Blinding 
After the end of the open run-in period, each patient was randomly assigned to one of two study drugs, 
either  to  the  test  product  (Epoetin  zeta)  or  to  the  reference  product  (Epoetin  alfa).  For  the 
presentations  1000  IU,  2000  IU,  and  3000  IU  per  syringe  the  volume  of  the  solution  is  different 
between  test  and  reference  product.  In  this  case  only  the  double-dummy  technique  could  ensure 
double-blind conditions.  
Due  to  the  fact  that  it  is  not  ethical  to  administer  to  all  patients  a  double  number  of  injections,  no 
blinding  was  used  in  the  present  trial.  Only  the  person(s)  involved  in  decision-making,  e.g.  dose 
adjustment,  was  masked  to  treatment  allocation.  This/these  person(s)  had  no  access  to  the  study 
medication. They were also not allowed to administer the study medication. 
Whilst,  the  main  phase  of  the  study  was  observer  blind,  the  follow-up  extension  phase  was  not 
controlled. A total number of 346 male and female patients who had completed the blinded treatment 
period of the trial (main study) started treatment with the test product Epoetin zeta in the open follow-
up extension period. 
Statistical Hypothesis and Planned Sample Size 
Main study phase 
From  the  statistical  point  of  view,  the  question  of  therapeutic  equivalence  was  approached  by 
calculating  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  difference  between  both  treatment  groups  of  the 
primary endpoints: 
• mean haemoglobin level during the last 4 weeks of treatment, 
• mean weekly epoetin dosage per kg body weight during the last 4 weeks of treatment. 
These  confidence  intervals  were  compared  with  the  pre-defined  clinical  acceptance  ranges  for  the 
corresponding  parameters  (±  0.5  g/dl  for  haemoglobin  and  ±  45  IU/kg/week  for  epoetin  dosage, 
based on the respective reference means). The intervals were calculated by means of ANOVA. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  statistical  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint  “mean  weekly  epoetin  dosage  per  kg  body  weight 
during  the  last  4  weeks  of  treatment”  was  performed  based  on  the  nominal  dosage  declared  on  the 
labels of the pre-filled syringes. 
As  the  dosage  of  epoetin  and  the  corresponding  level  of  haemoglobin  are  closely  interrelated,  a 
hierarchic test strategy was used in the present trial. The test on a higher level of hierarchy can only 
be performed, should the target of the previous level be fulfilled. The overall equivalence statement is 
consistent  with  a  positive  outcome  on  both  levels  of  hierarchy.  Due  to  this  reason,  no  adjustment  of 
alpha values was required on the separate levels. The levels of hierarchy were defined as follows: 
Level  1:  Calculation  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  difference  (test  -  reference)  of  the  mean 
haemoglobin  level  during  the  last  4  weeks  of  treatment  and  comparison  with  the  pre-defined 
acceptance range. 
Level  2:  Calculation  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  difference  (test  -  reference)  of  the  mean 
weekly epoetin dosage per kg body weight during the last 4 weeks of treatment and comparison with 
the pre-defined acceptance range. 
The statistical analysis was performed on three different patient populations: 
  Safety population (all patients who started therapy with randomised study medication). 
 
Full  analysis  set  (all  patients  who  were  treated  more  than  4  weeks  with  randomised  study 
medication). 
Per protocol population (excluding cases of major protocol violation and drop-outs). 
 
Open Follow-up Extension Phase 
The  statistical  analysis  of  the  results  of  the  open  follow-up  extension  period  were  only  descriptive. 
Depending  on  their  distribution  the  target  parameters  were  presented  with  their  means,  SD,  SEM, 
median and quartiles or with their incidences.

Recruitment 
The study period was from 06 February 2008 until 19 April 2010. A total of 679 patients were recruited 
in 42 centres across five countries. For the main study phase, recruitment took place in 14 centres in 
Bulgaria,  1  centre  in  Germany,  18  centres  in  Poland,  5  centres  in  Romania,  4  centres  in  Serbia.  The 
open  follow-up  extension  phase  involved  35  centres,  including  14  centres  in  Bulgaria,  15  centres  in 
Poland, 3 centres in Romania, 3 centres in Serbia. 
Conduct of the study 
The following changes in the conduct of the study were made: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Amendment 01 (dated 17-Jun-2008) to officially introduce the follow-up period after the end of the 
blinded treatment. 
No  further  changes  in  the  conduct  of  the  study  or  planned  analysis  were  done.  None  had  a  major 
impact on the conduct of the study. 
Baseline data   
The majority of patients enrolled in the trial belonged to the age group of 12 to 65 years (=360), 102 
patients were older than 65 years. In total, 272 patients were male and 190 were female. All patients 
enrolled were Caucasians. 
The mean age of the patients was 55.6 ± 12.47 years (Epoetin zeta) and 55.2 ± 12.58 years (Epoetin 
alfa). The mean height was 167.9 ± 8.77 cm (Epoetin zeta) and 167.0 ± 9.50 cm (Epoetin alfa). The 
mean weight of patients treated with Epoetin zeta group was 70.5 ± 15.11 kg and 70.8 ± 15.83 kg for 
patients treated with Epoetin alfa. The mean values for the body mass index (BMI) were 24.9 ± 4.46 
kg/m2 for Epoetin zeta and 25.3 ± 4.89 kg/m2 for Epoetin alfa. Both treatment groups are comparable 
regarding their demographic data.  
Important  baseline  characteristics  concern  the  history  and  information  about  renal  failure  and 
haemodialysis.  The  maximal  time  since  the  patients  suffered  from  end-stage  renal  failure  was  254 
months  in  patients  treated  with  Epoetin  zeta,  with  a  median  of  37.0  months,  and  310  months  in 
patients treated with Epoetin alfa, with a median of 36.5 months (tables 43 and 44, chapter 14.1.4.1). 
The  diagnosis  leading  to  renal  failure  was  primarily  glomerulonephritis  (31.5%  in  the  Epoetin  zeta 
group  and  30.0%  in  the  Epoetin  alfa  group),  followed  by  hypertensive  nephropathy  (15.5%,  Epoetin 
zeta and 14.8%, Epoetin alfa). Other diagnoses were given for 39.7% of patients treated with Epoetin 
zeta and for 44.3% of patients treated with Epoetin alfa. 
Information  on  haemodialysis  such  as  frequency,  average  duration,  KT/V  index,  and  urea  reduction 
ratio  (URR)  was  recorded.  Although  URR  was  not  a  part  of  the  requested  measurements  it  was 
included  into  the  evaluation  since  it  was  used  instead  of  KT/V  index  by  some  of  the  study  centres  in 
Bulgaria.  URR  is  used  besides  KT/V,  to  measure  how  effectively  a  dialysis  treatment  removed  waste 
products  from  the  body.    The  mean  frequency  of  haemodialysis  was  3  times  per  week  in  patients  of 
both  treatment  groups.  The  average  duration  was  4.1  hours  and  the  average  KT/V  index  was  1.3  in 
both treatment groups. The results of URR show mean values of 64.9 ± 10.99% for the Epoetin zeta 
group and 64.6 ± 10.36% for patients treated with Epoetin alfa. 
Information regarding life style and habits were recorded for the amount of consumption of alcohol and 
nicotine  as  well  as  for  the  intake  of  any  special  diet.  Most  of  the  patients  were  non-smokers  and 
consumed no alcohol (each 92.7% in the test group and 91.3% in the reference group). A special diet 
was registered in 29.3% of the patients in the test group and 27.0% of the patients in the reference 
group. 
Previous diseases, surgeries and injuries (medical history) which ended prior to study start were also 
recorded.  In total 342 findings were registered in 122 patients of the test group and 318 findings were 
recorded  in  115  patients  treated  with  reference.  The  majority  of  patients  suffered  from  conditions 
belonging  to  the  SOC  surgical  and  medical  procedures  with  160  findings  in  84  patients  of  the  test 
group and 152 findings in 84 patients of the reference group. The most common condition within this 
SOC  were  arteriovenous  fistula  operations  (128  cases  in  104  patients  altogether  in  both  treatment 
groups). The next common SOC was infections and infestations, with 34 findings in 19 patients of the 
test  group  and  28  findings  in  24  patients  of  the  reference  group;  mainly  pneumonia  and  bronchitis 
were  registered  within  this  SOC.  Gastrointestinal  disorders  were  recorded  for  41  patients  with  49 
findings  (Epoetin  zeta  group:  20  cases  in  18  patients;  Epoetin  alfa  group:  29  cases  in  23  patients), 
whereas  the  most  frequent  diagnosis  within  this  group  was  duodenal  ulcer  in each  4  patients  in  both 
treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
The principal reasons for premature study discontinuation were: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any adverse event after which a continuation of treatment would constitute an unacceptably high 
risk for the patient, 
any new or intercurrent disease likely to interfere with the conduct of the study, 
patient is unwilling to adhere to the study requirement, e.g. non-compliance or 
 
 
  no cooperation, 
 
occurrence of an exclusion criterion. 
Whenever  a  patient  withdrew  or  discontinued  the  study,  the  circumstances  of  the  withdrawal  or 
discontinuation had to be recorded in detail in the CRF and a complete final examination as scheduled 
for final visit should be conducted as far as possible.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints 
The mean haemoglobin level during the last 4 weeks was 10.94 ± 0.84 g/dl for patients treated with 
Epoetin zeta and 11.02 ± 0.94 g/dl for patients treated with Epoetin alfa. The 95% confidence interval 
of the difference (test - reference) of the mean haemoglobin level during the last 4 weeks of treatment 
(level 1 of the hierarchic test strategy) was between -0.28 g/dl and 0.12 g/dl and thus entirely within 
the pre-defined equivalence range (±0.5 g/dl).  
The mean weekly epoetin dosage per kg body weight during the last 4 weeks of treatment was 97.0 ± 
94.3  IU/kg/week  (Epoetin  zeta)  and  86.0  ±  78.0  IU/kg/week  (Epoetin  alfa).  The  95%  confidence 
interval  of  the  difference  (test  -  reference)  of  the  mean  weekly  epoetin  dosage  per  kg  body  weight 
during  the  last  4  weeks  of  treatment  (level  2  of  the  hierarchic  test  strategy)  was  between  -8.03 
IU/kg/week  and  30.00  IU/kg/week  and  thus  also  within  the  pre-defined  equivalence  range  of  ±45 
IU/kg/week. 
The  95%  confidence  intervals  were  within  the  pre-defined  acceptance  ranges  for  both  primary 
endpoints. According to the criteria set in the study protocol it could be concluded that the test product 
Epoetin zeta is equivalent with the reference product Epoetin alfa in respect of its clinical efficacy. 
The results obtained for the full analysis set of patients were practically identical with those observed 
in  the  per  protocol  population.  The  results  of  both  primary  endpoints  (haemoglobin  and  dosage)  are 
presented in tables 2 and 3 as well as in figures 1 and 2. 
The  graphical  presentation  demonstrated  that  both  products,  Epoetin  zeta  and  Epoetin  alfa,  were 
effective  regarding  their  ability  to  maintain  haemoglobin  levels  within  the  target  range  of  10.0-12.0 
g/dl (10.5-11.5 ± 0.5 g/dl).

Secondary endpoints 
Mean haematocrit levels during main study phase: 
The difference between the mean haematocrit levels during the main study phase for patients treated 
with Epoetin zeta and patients treated with Epoetin alfa is minor and not statistically significant: 33.7 
± 2.0% (test) and 34.0 ± 1.9% (reference). 
Table 4: Mean haematocrit levels [%] over main study phase - Descriptive statistics,  
per protocol population 
Proportion of patients with any permanent or transient changes of haemoglobin levels of more than 1 
g/dl during main study phase: 
In the group of patients treated with the test product 66 patients (42.9%) had a permanent and 131 
patients (85.1%) had a transient change of haemoglobin of more than 1 g/dl. In the reference product 
group 59 patients (35.8%) had a permanent haemoglobin change, whilst 148 patients (89.7%) had a 
transient change. 
Proportion of patients with any permanent or transient dose change during main study phase: 
One hundred thirty-five patients (87.7%) treated with Epoetin zeta had a permanent and 139 patients 
(90.3%)  had  a  transient  dose  change.  A  permanent  dosage  change  in  patients  treated  with  Epoetin 
alfa was necessary in 136 patients (82.4%), whilst transient dosage changes occurred in 141 patients 
(85.5%). 
Proportion of patients with any haemoglobin measurement outside the target range during main study 
phase: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  course  of  the  treatment  haemoglobin  values  outside  the  target  range  (10.0-12.0  g/dl)  were 
observed  in  134  patients  (87.0%)  of  the  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  in  143  patients  (86.7%)  of  the 
Epoetin alfa group. 
Incidence of blood transfusions: 
During  the  open  run-in  phase  with  the  test  product  no  blood  transfusions  were  registered.  In  the 
course of the main study phase 2 single blood transfusions were performed in the test group (Epoetin 
zeta). 
Evaluation of efficacy parameters for the open follow-up extension period: 
The  mean  nominal  weekly  epoetin  dosage  in  the  course  of  the  open  follow-up  extension  period  was 
between  90.7  ±  84.5  IU/kg/week  and  109.1  ±  98.2  IU/kg/week.  The  mean  haemoglobin  values, 
measured in monthly intervals, varied between 10.7 and 11.2 g/dl, and confirmed the observation of 
the main study that Epoetin zeta is effective to maintain haemoglobin levels between the target range 
of 10.0-12.0 g/dl (10.5-11.5 ± 0.5 g/dl). The mean haematocrit levels were between 32.6 and 34.4%. 
The  incidences  of  transient/permanent  Hb  and  dosage  changes  as  well  as  the  proportion  of  patients 
with any Hb value outside target range are similar to those observed in the main study. In the course 
of the follow-up period 16 patients received one blood transfusion; five patients needed 2 transfusions, 
and in one case 3 blood transfusions were necessary. 
Supportive studies 
No new supportive studies have been submitted together with this variation.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy  
According  to  the  EMA  guidance  on  similar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/94526/2005 Corr., 2006) comparable clinical efficacy between the similar and the 
reference  product  should  be  demonstrated  in  at  least  two  adequately  powered,  randomised,  parallel-
group  clinical  trials.  The  clinical  trials  should  include  a  ‘correction  phase’  study  during  anaemia 
correction  and  a  ‘maintenance  phase’  study  in  patients  on  epoetin  maintenance  therapy.  Clinical 
comparability  should  be  demonstrated  for  both  routes  of  administration,  IV  and  SC  administration. 
According to the EMA guidance on non-clinical and clinical development of similar  biological medicinal 
products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins, 
  (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/301636/2008  Corr.*),  
extrapolation to other indications of the reference medicinal product can be claimed. 
In  the  case  of  Epoetin  zeta,  a  correction  phase  and  a  maintenance  phase  study  were  already 
performed  (Studies 411-54-04-05-0000  and 411-54- 04-04-0000 ) for the IV route of administration. 
These studies proved that the test product is able to achieve (correction phase study) and to maintain 
(maintenance  phase  study)  target  haemoglobin  (Hb)  concentrations  in  anaemic  patients  with  end-
stage renal failure.  
Following    the  granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  in  the  European  Union  for  the  IV  route  of 
administration in renal anaemia, only one further trial was necessary to prove the efficacy and safety 
of  Epoetin  zeta  for  the  SC  route  of  administration  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia.  Both  a  correction 
phase  and  a  maintenance  phase  trial  were  considered  suitable  to  provide  the  above-mentioned 
evidence. The MAH therefore performed a maintenance phase trial. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  maintenance  study  (411-54-07-08-000)  was  to  prove  the  therapeutic 
equivalence of Epoetin zeta to the reference product Epoetin alfa administered SC for maintaining the 
Hb  concentration  in  anaemic  patients  with  end-stage  renal  failure  on  chronic  haemodialysis  between 
10.0 and 12.0 g/dl. 
The  results  of  the main  phase  of  the maintenance  study  showed  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  (see 
below, Discussion on Clinical Safety) for the SC use of Epoetin zeta and Epoetin alfa. For the primary 
endpoints  haemoglobin  and  epoetin  dosage,  the  study  showed  that  the  95%  confidence  intervals  for 
the differences between  Epoetin zeta and Epoetin alfa were within the predefined acceptance ranges. 
The results for the secondary endpoints support equivalent efficacy of test and reference. 
As  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  Epoetin  zeta  to the  reference  product  Epoetin  alfa  administered  SC 
was  demonstrated  with  Study  411-54-07-08-000  in  anaemic  patients  with  end-stage  renal  failure,  it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can be concluded that SC administration of Epoetin zeta can be used in patients prior to major elective 
orthopaedic surgery in order to avoid exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions. 
Therefore the CHMP was of the opinion that section 4.1 of the SmPC should be amended to include the 
following indication; “Retacrit can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult 
non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for 
transfusion complications. Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. Hb 10-13 
g/dl)  who  do  not  have  an  autologous  predonation  programme  available  and  with  expected  moderate 
blood loss (900 to 1800 ml).” 
Section  1  “What  Retacrit  is  and  what  it  is  used  for”  of  the  Package  Leaflet  should  also  be  aligned  to 
state: “ Retacrit is used - in moderately anaemic adult patients about to undergo  major orthopaedic 
(bone)  surgery  (for  example  hip  or  knee  replacement  therapy)  to  reduce  the  need  for  blood 
transfusions.” 
In line with the inclusion of this new indication, section 4.2 “Posology” of the SmPC should be updated 
to  include  the  following  recommendation:  “Treatment  of  adult  patients  scheduled  for  major  elective 
orthopaedic surgery. Retacrit should be administered subcutaneously. A dose of 600 IU/kg body weight 
should be administered,  once weekly for three weeks (on day 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on 
the  day  of  surgery  (day  0).  If  the  lead  time  before  surgery  needs  to  be  shortened  to  less  than  three 
weeks, a dose of 300 IU/kg body weight should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, 
on  the  day  of  surgery  and  for  four  days  immediately  thereafter.  When  performing  haematologic 
assessments  during  the  preoperative  period,  if  the  haemoglobin  level  reaches  15  g/dl,  or  higher, 
administration  of  Retacrit  should  be  stopped  and  further  doses  should  not  be  given.  Iron  deficiencies 
should  be  treated  prior  to  starting  treatment  with  Retacrit.  In  addition,  all  patients  should  receive 
adequate  iron  supplementation  (e.g.  200  mg  oral  elemental  iron  daily)  throughout  the  course  of 
Retacrit treatment. If possible, iron supplementation should be started prior to treatment with Retacrit, 
to achieve adequate iron stores.” 
In line with the SmPC amendment, Section 3 “How to use Retacrit” of the Package Leaflet should also 
be updated to state: “Use in adult patients scheduled for major orthopaedic (bone) surgery.  A dose of 
600 IU/kg  is given by injection under the skin once weekly for 3 weeks before surgery and on the day 
of surgery. In cases where there is a need to shorten the period before the operation is carried out, a 
dose of 300 IU/kg is given on each of the 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for 4 days 
immediately afterwards. If blood tests in the period before the operation show your haemoglobin level 
to be too high, the treatment will be stopped. It is also important that levels of iron in your blood are 
normal throughout Retacrit treatment. Where appropriate you will receive oral doses of iron each day, 
ideally starting before Retacrit treatment.  
3.4 Clinical safety 
Data were submitted from Study 411-54-07-08-0000, in which the safety of Epoetin zeta administered 
SC for maintenance treatment of renal anaemia was compared to Epoetin alfa, with particular focus on 
the formation of anti-epoetin antibodies.  
Extent of Exposure 
The safety population of the main study phase consisted of 462 patients, whereas the full analysis set, 
in  which  all  patients  who  were  treated  for  more  than  4  weeks  with  randomised  study  medication, 
consisted of 450 patients (Epoetin zeta: 228 patients; Epoetin alfa: 222 patients). Of the patients who 
were treated in the main study phase with Epoetin zeta or Epoetin alfa a total number of 346 patients 
entered  the  open  follow-up  extension  period  of  treatment  with  Epoetin  zeta  for  up  to  54  weeks  and 
were evaluated in the final report on drug safety dated 13 August 2010.

During  the  blind  treatment  period,  649  adverse  events  (test:  357  AEs  in  91  patients;  reference:  292 
AEs in 92 patients occurred. The adverse events belonged mainly to SOCs of infections and infestations 
(n=64, test group; n=47, reference group), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (n=42, test

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  occurring  in  at  least  5  patients  (>  2%)  in  either  treatment  group 
were: diarrhoea (12 patients in Epoetin zeta group and 5 patients in Epoetin alfa group), headache (11 
patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  4  patients  in  Epoetin  alfa  group),  hypertension  (9  patients  in 
Epoetin zeta group and 11 patients in Epoetin alfa group), pain in extremity (3 patients in Epoetin zeta 
group  and  9  patients  in  Epoetin  alfa  group),  nasopharyngitis  (5  patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  9 
patients in Epoetin alfa group), bronchitis (8 patients in Epoetin zeta group and 5 patients in Epoetin 
alfa  group),  urinary  tract  infection  (6  patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  1  patient  in  Epoetin  alfa 
group),  haemodialysis  induced  symptom  (6  patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  8  patients  in  Epoetin 
alfa  group),  atrial  fibrillation  (5  patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  2  patients  in  Epoetin  alfa  group), 
haematuria  (5  patients  in  Epoetin  zeta  group  and  none  in  the  Epoetin  alfa  group),  and  gastritis  (1 
patient in Epoetin zeta group and 5 patients in the Epoetin alfa group). 
Deaths 
A  total  number  of  11  patients  died  in  the  course  of  the  open  run-in  phase  with  the  test  product 
(Epoetin  zeta)  before  being  randomised.  The  relationship  between  study  medication  and  the  serious 
adverse events, which led to the deaths, were assessed as not related in all cases. 
During  the  observer-blind  main  study  phase  a  total  number  of  23  patients  died,  16  patients  under 
treatment  with  the  test  drug  and  7  patients  under  treatment  with  the  reference  product.  These 
patients  experienced  45  serious  adverse  events,  which  belonged  mainly  to  the  group  of  nervous 
system  disorders,  followed  by  cardiac  disorders  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions. Only in 1 case, a patient who was treated with reference product, the relationship between 
study  medication  and  the  serious  adverse  events  which  led  to  death  was  assessed  as  possible. 
Additional  to  that,  in  one  patient  treated  with  the  test  product,  the  relationship  between  study 
medication and the serious adverse events which led to death was assessed as possible related by the 
sponsor, whilst investigator assessment was unlikely. 
Additional  analyses  of  deaths  were  performed  in  order  to  find  out  if  there  are  any  reasons  for  the 
imbalance in the number of deaths between test and reference group. The following parameters were 
evaluated:  reasons  for  renal  failure,  previous  diseases  /  medications,  concomitant  diseases  / 
medications, haemoglobin levels, epoetin dose, blood pressure, withdrawals of study medication due to 
AE or SAE, deaths per centre and country, as well as the effect of additional risk factors by means of a 
logistic regression. It was observed that patients who died during treatment with the test preparation: 
• were more severely ill as compared to the remaining patients in this group as they had a significantly 
higher incidence of myocardial ischaemia, diabetic neuropathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and aortic aneurysm; 
• had lower haemoglobin levels as the remaining patients in this group; 
• had significant higher epoetin doses as the remaining patients in this group. 
A  higher  proportion  of  patients  was  observed  for  centers  in  Bulgaria,  which  was  associated  with 
significantly worse KT/V index as compared to all other countries. Further risk factors had no relevant 
effect on the incidence of cases of death.  
A total number of 35 patients died in the course of the open follow-up extension period up to 54 weeks. 
The  largest  number  of  deaths  is  attributed  or  associated  with  cardiac  disorders,  infections  and 
infestations, and nervous system disorders. In two cases (Cardiopulmonary failure, General disorders) 
the  relationship  between  study  medication  and  the  serious  adverse  events  which  led  to  death  were 
assessed as not assessable and in one case (Cerebrovascular accident) as possibly related. In all other 
cases  no  causal  relationship  between  the  intake  of  study  drug  and  the  serious  adverse  events  which 
led to death were assessed and the serious adverse events which led to death was reported. 
Adverse events and serious adverse events 
The  majority  of  serious  adverse  events  (n=146)  in  the  blind  treatment  period  belonged  to  the  SOC

treatment, respectively; mainly renal transplantation), cardiac disorders (13.8% and 17.3% of all SAEs 
under  test  and  reference  treatment,  respectively;  mainly  arterial  fibrillation),  and  nervous  system 
disorders  (14.9%  and  13.5%  of  all  SAEs  under  test  and  reference  treatment,  respectively;  mainly 
haemorrhagic stroke). Differences in frequency of adverse events in general and according to MedDRA 
SOCs between both treatment groups could not be observed. 
The  analysis  of  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse  events,  which  included  severity,  outcome, 
relationship  to  study  medication  as  well  as  the  action  taken  with  study  medication  revealed  no 
differences between treatments.

The majority of serious adverse events (n=204) during the open follow-up extension period belonged 
to the group of gastrointestinal disorders (33 SAEs in 13 patients), followed by the groups of infections 
and infestations (31 SAEs in 24 patients), cardiac disorders (28 SAEs in 21 patients), and surgical and 
medical procedures (21 SAEs in 16 patients). 
Incidence of haemoglobin levels above 13 g/dl 
The incidence of haemoglobin levels above 13 g/dl was one of the safety endpoints in the present trial, 
because  high  haemoglobin  values  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  serious  cardiovascular 
complications in patients with chronic renal failure. In more than 90% of patients no Hb values above 
13 g/dl were registered in open run-in treatment period with the test product. In the main study phase 
the  proportion  of  patients  with  no  Hb  values  above  13  g/dl  decreased  (76.7%  for  the  Epoetin  zeta 
treatment  group  and  76.2%  for  the  Epoetin  alfa  treatment  group)  with  no  significant  differences 
between both treatment groups. 
In the course of the open follow-up extension period 83.2% of all patients had no Hb values above 13 
g/dl. 
Anti-epoetin antibodies 
All  patients  were  tested  for  the  presence  of  anti-epoetin  antibodies  (last  available  blood  sample).  No 
case  of  anti-epoetin  antibodies  was  noted  in  the  very  sensitive  screening  assay.  Furthermore,  no 
clinical  signs  for  pure  red  cell  aplasia  were  observed  in  any  patient  in  the  course  of  the  whole  trial 
(main study and open follow-up extension period). 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  recombinant  human  erythropoietin  is  well  established.  Special  aspects  of  the 
safety  profile  that  are  reflected  in  the  precautions  and  warnings  section  of  the  reference  Epoetin  alfa 
SmPC  (Erypo)  are  the  potential  for  hypertension  and  the  necessity  of  closely  monitoring  the  blood 
pressure,  the  risk  of  thrombotic  events,  particularly  in  cancer  patients  and  patients  scheduled  for 
major  elective  orthopaedic  surgery,  monitoring  of  Hb  levels,  the  use  with  caution  in  the  presence  of 
epilepsy  and  chronic  liver  failure,  and  the  recommendation  for  iron  supplementation.    The  frequency 
and type of AEs reported for patients treated with SC administration of Epoetin zeta were shown to be 
very  similar  to  the  frequency  and  type  of  AEs  reported  for  patients  treated  with  SC  administration  of 
Epoetin alfa. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  section  4.3  “Contraindications”  of  the  SmPC  should  be 
aligned  with  that  of  the  reference  product  to  state  the  following:  “In  the  indication  of  major  elective 
orthopaedic  surgery:  severe  coronary,  peripheral  arterial,  carotid  or  cerebral  vascular  disease, 
including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 2. “Before you use Retacrit “ of the Package Leaflet  should also be aligned to state: “ Do not 
use Retacrit. – if you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip or knee replacement, and: 
you  have  severe  heart  disease  or  severe  vascular  disorder  of  the  veins  or  arteries;  you  had  a  heart 
attach or stroke recently.” 
Similarly,  section  4.4  “Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use”  of  the  SmPC  should  be  aligned  to 
state  the  following:  “Patients  scheduled  for  major elective  orthopaedic  surgery.  In  patients  scheduled 
for  major  elective  orthopaedic  surgery  the  cause  of  anaemia  should  be  established  and  treated,  if 
possible, before the start of Retacrit treatment. Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and 
this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment.  
Patients  should  receive  adequate  antithrombotic  prophylaxis,  as  thrombotic  and  vascular  events  may 
occur  in  surgical  patients,  especially  in  those  with  underlying  cardiovascular  disease.  In  addition, 
special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of DVTs. Moreover, 
in  patients  with  a  baseline  haemoglobin  of  > 13 g/dl,  the  possibility  that  Retacrit  treatment  may  be 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  postoperative  thrombotic/vascular  events  cannot  be  excluded. 
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/dl.” 
In addition, Section 4.8  “Undesirable effects” should be amended with the following wording: “Surgery 
Patients. In patients with a baseline haemoglobin  of > 13 g/dl, the possibility that Retacrit treatment 
may  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  postoperative  thrombotic/vascular  events  cannot  be 
excluded.” 
The evaluation of long-term safety data up to 1 year of Epoetin zeta administered subcutaneously to at 
least 200 patients with renal anaemia was part of a comprehensive Risk Management Plan. The results 
of  the  follow-up  extension  period  of  study  411-54-07-08-000  showed  that  the  Hb  levels  were 
maintained  within  the  predefined  target  range.  Results  for  epoetin  doses  and  further  results  for  the 
secondary  endpoints  did  not  show  meaningful  differences  compared  to  the  results  of  the  main  study 
phase. The final results did not reveal any new safety concern. No anti-epoetin antibodies have been 
detected by the MAH and no neutralizing antibodies have been reported. 
Further  safety  data  will  be  obtained  of  ongoing  safety  studies.  The  MAH  is  conducting  a  Post-
Authorisation  Safety  Cohort  Observation  Study (PASCO  II,  PMS-830-09-0082)  (see  EU-RMP,  Table  8) 
which aims to recruit a number of 6700 patients with an observation period of 3 years per patient (to 
ensure  a  cumulative  follow-up  of  20.000  patient  years).  The  primary  aim  of  the  study  is  to  estimate 
the incidence of pure red cell aplasia in patients with renal anaemia treated with epoetin zeta.

The Risk Management Plan has been adequately updated in order to reflect the new indication.  
In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH  should  take  the  following  minor  points  into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
The EU-RMP should be aligned with the EU-RMP template (Doc.Ref. EMEA/192632/2006). This update 
should  include  aligning  sections  1.10  and  5  and  completing  section  2.4  with  all  additional 
pharmacovigilance measures with defined dates for the submission of final data.  
No further measures are currently to be taken concerning the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 
Annex II.B has been updated in accordance with the latest QRD template (version 7.3.1, March 2010), 
and to include the new RMP version number as follows: “Risk Management Plan. The MAH commits to 
performing  the  studies  and  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  detailed  in  the  Pharmacovigilance 
Plan,  as  agreed  in  version  8.0  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  presented  in  Module  1.8.2.  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.” 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional 
risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
As  mentioned  in  the  revised  CHMP  guidance  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  similar  
biological medicinal products containing recombinant erythropoietins,  (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/301636/ 
2008  Corr.*),  the  mechanism  of  action  of  epoetin  is  the  same  in  all  its  current  indications,  and 
therefore, the efficacy of subcutaneous Epoetin zeta (Retacrit) in orthopaedic surgery is expected to be 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable  to  that  of  Epoetin  alfa  (Erypo)  given  that  comparable  efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  in 
the sensitive model of renal anaemia in study 411-54-07-08-0000.  
 
 
 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  the  above  mentioned  study,  the  safety  profile  of  subcutaneous  Epoetin  zeta  (Retacrit)  has  been 
shown  to  be  broadly  comparable  to  that  of  Epoetin  alfa  (Erypo)  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia.    No 
additional safety issues are expected in orthopaedic patients. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit-risk balance of Epoetin zeta (Retacrit) in moderately anaemic adult patients scheduled for 
major  orthopaedic  surgery  is  expected  to  be  comparable  to  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  reference 
product Epoetin alfa (Erypo); it is therefore considered positive within the same restricted conditions of 
use.   
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The  application  has  demonstrated  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  for  Epoetin  zeta  (Retacrit)  and  
Epoetin  alfa  (Erypo)  in  separate  clinical  studies  for  both  routes  of  administration  (SC  and  IV). 
Extrapolation  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  to  the  new  indication  has  been  performed  based  on 
demonstrated  similarity  in  physicochemical  characteristics,  efficacy  and  safety  between  test  and 
reference  products,  same  mechanism  of  action/same  receptor 
involved,  and  absence  of 
additional/unique safety concerns in the new indication. 
The  Risk  Management  Plan  has  been  updated  in  order  to  reflect  the  new  indication.  No  further 
measures are currently to be taken concerning the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  Benefit-Risk  ratio  of  Epoetin  zeta  (Retacrit)  to  reduce 
exposure  to  allogeneic  blood  transfusions  in  adult  non-iron  deficient  patients  prior  to  major  elective 
orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications, is positive.  
Consequential changes to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and to the Package Leaflet 
were introduced. 
Further, the MAH has updated Annex II.B, in accordance with the QRD template v.7.3.1, and to reflect 
the  latest  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (version  8.0)  agreed  with  the  CHMP,  which  is 
acceptable. Minor editorial changes have also been implemented. 
5.  Conclusion 
On  23  June  2011  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable.  Amendments  were 
introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet

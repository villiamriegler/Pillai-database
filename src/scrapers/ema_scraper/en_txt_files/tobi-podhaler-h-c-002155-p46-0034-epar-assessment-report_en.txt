1.  Introduction 
On 16 September 2022, the MAH submitted the final results of the study CTMBM100C2407 (2407), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
No proposals for amendments to the Product Information were submitted as part of this procedure. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study CTBM100C2407 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The medications used were TOBI Podhaler (tobramycin inhalation powder) and comparator agents, 
e.g., TOBI solution (tobramycin inhalation solution), Bethkis (tobramycin inhalation solution) and 
Cayston (aztreonam inhalation solution).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
CTMBM100C2407 (2407), a prospective observational study in cystic fibrosis patients with 
chronic respiratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection treated with TOBI Podhaler (tobramycin 
inhalation powder) or other FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal antibacterial drugs. 
The study was requested as increased resistance to tobramycin and other antibiotics, as well as 
emergence of other pathogens, was observed during therapy. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study CTMBM100C2407 (2407) 
Description 
This was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study conducted over a 5-year period in a 
subset of CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection enrolled in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Patient Registry Database (PortCF). Based on physician discretion, enrolled patients were either 
treated with TOBI Podhaler (tobramycin inhalation powder) or other FDA-approved inhaled 
antipseudomonal antibacterial drugs. 
The purpose of the study was: 1) To determine if decreased susceptibility to tobramycin is increasing 
in P. aeruginosa from CF patients. 2) To monitor resistance to meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, 
aztreonam and ciprofloxacin. 3) Evaluate the emergence of the following treatment-emergent 
pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and 
Burkholderia spp. 4) Evaluate clinical outcomes in the first year (change in lung function, respiratory 
and non-respiratory hospitalisations, mortality and use of new antipseudomonal antibiotics) in patients 
using TOBI Podhaler compared to a cohort using other FDA-approved inhaled anti-pseudomonal 
antibiotics. 
EMA/CHMP/924748/2022  
Page 3/14 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The design of the study is presented in Figure 1. Patients were screened consecutively (i.e., as they 
presented in the clinic) and, if eligible, enrolled either into the TOBI Podhaler cohort or the non-TOBI 
Podhaler cohort (other FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal treatments). Patients could be enrolled 
at any time, i.e., during an on-cycle or off-cycle treatment period. Treatment cohorts were defined by 
the inhaled antibiotic – TOBI Podhaler or non-TOBI Podhaler (other FDA-approved inhaled 
antipseudomonal treatments) – used by the patients at baseline (Figure 1). For patients enrolled 
during an off-cycle treatment period, cohort assignment was defined by the inhaled antibiotic used 
during the on-cycle treatment period immediately preceding enrolment. 
The design seems adequate to evaluate whether susceptibility to tobramycin is decreasing and which 
treatment-emergent pathogens occur in CF patients chronically treated with TOBI Podhaler or other 
FDA-approved inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in a real-world setting. An observational study with 
no randomisation reflects normal prescribing procedures and the real-world situation. However, the 
lack of randomisation could potentially lead to patient selection, treatment biases and disbalances in 
baseline characteristics.

Methods 
Study participants 
This study included CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection enrolled in the PortCF registry and 
using TOBI Podhaler (TOBI Podhaler cohort) or other FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal 
antibiotics (non-TOBI Podhaler cohort). To be eligible for the study, male and female patients ≥6 years 
of age (including adults) were required to have at least two positive P. aeruginosa cultures and 
adequate lung function (FEV1 ≥ 25% predicted documented in the previous year). In addition, they 
needed to be prescribed, and initiated chronic treatment with FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal 
antibiotics for chronic P. aeruginosa infection (e.g., TOBI Podhaler, TOBI solution (tobramycin 
inhalation solution), Bethkis (tobramycin inhalation solution), or Cayston (aztreonam inhalation 
solution)). 
Patients were excluded from the study if they met the following criteria: 1) they had a documented 
FEV1 < 25% predicted in the previous year; 2) were participating in an interventional clinical study 
with an inhaled antibiotic treatment; 3) were on treatment with compounded tobramycin (e.g., 
tobramycin intravenous solution adapted for use by inhalation) or treatment with inhaled 
EMA/CHMP/924748/2022  
Page 4/14 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
antipseudomonal antibacterial drug(s) that were not FDA-approved; or 4) if they were undergoing an 
early eradication regimen for CF (first line therapy). 
The population is representative of the real-world CF population with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. 
Prescribers were free to choose treatment regimens for their patients. However, it is noted that the 
upper limit of FEV1% of 80% was removed from the protocol. It is stated in the FDA label that "Safety 
and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients under the age of 6 years, patients with forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <25% or >80%, or patients colonised with Burkholderia 
cepacian" (EMA SmPC states <25% or >75%). As the limit was removed, participants could have 
higher FEV1%. This indicates that participants with better lung function could be included in the study 
if they were diagnosed with CF and had P. aeruginosa infection. 
Treatments 
The medications of interest were TOBI Podhaler (tobramycin inhalation powder) and comparator 
agents, e.g., TOBI solution (tobramycin inhalation solution), Bethkis (tobramycin inhalation solution) 
and Cayston (aztreonam inhalation solution). The choice of treatment, as well as the decision to 
discontinue treatment, were at the sole discretion of the prescribing physician and the patients/parents 
or legal guardians and was independent from participation in this study. 
Enrolled patients were followed for up to 5 years whether or not they continued on the TOBI Podhaler 
or non-TOBI Podhaler options they were using at baseline visit. In particular, patients switching from 
TOBI Podhaler to alternative inhaled antibiotics or vice versa for any reason during the study continued 
to be followed up to 5 years post enrolment unless they voluntarily withdrew from the study. This is 
understood from a prescriber's perspective; however, this could hamper conclusions being drawn from 
this study.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Microbiological assessment 
For microbiological assessments during the course of the study, sputum collected as part of routine 
care, including at baseline, from patients able to spontaneously produce sputum was used. If a patient 
was unable to spontaneously expectorate, a deep-throat cough swab specimen was collected instead 
(the protocol was amended in October 2017 to allow for the use of deep-throat cough swab specimens 
when patients are unable to spontaneously produce sputum). 
Sputum was collected in sterile containers and cultured for the presence of P. aeruginosa (quantitative 
test), the following pathogens (S. aureus [MRSA and MSSA], S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, 
Burkholderia spp.) and other typical CF respiratory pathogens (qualitative tests). MIC values for P. 
aeruginosa were determined for specimens obtained to assess change in pathogen susceptibility to 
tobramycin. Meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin MIC values were also 
determined. 
The number of P. aeruginosa CFUs in sputum was also assessed quantitatively. A central laboratory 
(ICON plc) was used for quantitative and qualitative microbiology assessments and susceptibility 
testing. Details on the collection, shipment of samples, generation of data and reporting of results by 
the central laboratory was provided to participating sites in a separate laboratory manual. 
Safety assessments 
Information on all AEs and SAEs occurring during the course of this study were collected and reported. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size estimation was performed. The revised sample size of 400 patients (150 TOBI 
Podhaler-treated patients and 250 patients on other inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics) was 
anticipated to provide sufficient data for the study's objectives. As this was a non-randomised, 
observational study, the fact that no sample size calculation was performed can be accepted 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical Methods 
The baseline demographic and clinical outcomes of the study population were described for overall 
population and stratified by initial treatment cohort. All categorical data were summarised by 
frequencies and percentages. Continuous data were summarised by number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the microbiology assessments and safety in this final 
report. 
Study populations 
A total of 409 patients were enrolled and 408 were included in the full analysis set (FAS), as 1 patient 
in the TOBI Podhaler cohort did not receive any inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic during the study. 
The safety set consisted of 408 patients who took at least one dose of TOBI Podhaler or another FDA -
approved inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic. The propensity score matching (PSM) analysis set was 
defined as the patients that were successfully matched between the two treatment cohorts using the 
PSM method. 
EMA/CHMP/924748/2022  
Page 6/14 
 
 
  
 
 
Microbiological analyses were done in patients who provided sputum samples and for whom 
microbiology data was available. 
Five patients sets were defined for analysis purpose: 
1.  The  Full  Analysis  Set:  included  408  eligible  CF  patients  who  enrolled  in  the  study  and  were 
chronically colonised with P. aeruginosa infection: 149 of whom were using TOBI Podhaler and 
259 patients were using another FDA-approved  inhaled  antipseudomonal  antibiotic (non-TOBI 
Podhaler cohort) at baseline. 
2.  The Safety Analysis Set: consisted of all patients in the FAS who took at least 1 dose of TOBI 
Podhaler or non-TOBI Podhaler agent. 
3.  PK  set:  included  51  (34.0%)  patients  out  of  149  TOBI  Podhaler  patients  who  were  able  to 
spontaneously  produce  at  least  one  sputum  sample,  including  5  (3.3%)  patients  using  TOBI 
Podhaler who provided the informed consent to participate in the optional TOBI Podhaler PK sub-
study. 
4.  Optional sputum microbiology sub-set: included 6 (4.0%) patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort 
and 7 (2.7%) patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort who were able to spontaneously produce 
sputum. 
5.  Propensity  score  matched  (PSM)  analysis  set:  included  262  (64.1%)  patients  who  were 
successfully matched between the two treatment cohorts using the propensity score matching 
method, including 131 (87.3%) patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 131 (50.6%) patients 
in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
Microbiological assessment and MIC 
The MIC data for tobramycin and the antipseudomonal antibacterial drugs (meropenem, imipenem, 
ceftazidime, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin) for P. aeruginosa were summarised. 
The distribution of tobramycin and other antibiotic MIC with respect to P. aeruginosa at baseline and 
for the last assessment within each post-baseline time interval (> baseline to 1 year, > 1-2 years, > 2-
3 years, > 3-4 years, and > 4-5 years) was summarised by biotype, all biotypes and maximum of 
biotypes. This summary was based on the total number of isolates during a time interval, not the 
number of patients, a patient with more than one biotype is included with as many biotypes as 
isolated. 
Shifts of MIC with respect to P. aeruginosa at the last assessment within each post-baseline time 
interval, as compared to baseline were summarised by biotype, maximum MIC of all biotypes and all 
biotypes according to the following categories: 
•  MIC > 8 µg/mL (baseline must be ≤ 8 µg/mL). 
•  MIC > 128 μg/mL (baseline must be < 64 μg/mL). 
•  ≥ 2, 4, and 8-fold increase from baseline. 
•  Change within 2-fold from baseline (increase or decrease). 
•  ≥ 4-fold increase and MIC > 8 µg/mL. 
A graphical display of the MIC distribution was provided for all P. aeruginosa biotypes per time point 
and cohort. 
As an exploratory analysis, statistical comparison of MIC between two treatment cohorts was explored 
using the PSM set with a repeated measure logistic regression analysis on the incidence of a 2-fold (4-
fold, 8-fold) MIC increase compared to the baseline value for the maximum of biotypes. The model 
included x-fold MIC increase (yes, no) as dependent variable, and treatment cohort, log10(baseline 
value of MIC), time interval and treatment cohort by time interval interaction as exploratory variables. 
Analyses were carried out with SAS PROC GENMOD using patients within matched pairs as subject for

the repeat statement and type=CS (compound symmetry) correlation structure. Odds ratios (ORs), 
including 95% CI, were presented. 
Treatment-emergent pathogens in sputum 
Sputum specimens for microbiology were analysed by a central laboratory to assess pathogens present 
and P. aeruginosa CFUs in sputum. The frequency of the following treatment-emergent pathogens in 
sputum: S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA), S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, and Burkholderia spp. were 
summarised per year in study and cumulatively as the number of patients and percentage for overall 
population and by treatment cohorts. 
Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest 
AEs and SAEs were summarised by primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for 
each treatment cohort and overall for the population. Additionally, the number and incidence rates 
(IRs) of SAEs, together with the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the IRs were provided. AEs were 
coded using the MedDRA Version 24.1 terminology. 
Missing values 
All attempts were made by the treating physician and/or site personnel to limit the amount of missing 
data. No imputation was made on the CRFs for missing data and no imputation was made in the 
analysis in this report. All summaries were done based on the available observed values unless 
otherwise specified. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess any effect of enrolling patients during an on-cycle or off-
cycle treatment period on select treatment comparisons. 
Amendments to the statistical analysis plan 
Statistical analysis plan was amended twice (dated 09 February 2017 and 07 March 2018) to align with 
changes introduced by protocol amendments 3 (dated 10 August 2016) and 4 (dated 13 October 
2017). The changes addressed FDA recommendations to conduct sensitivity analyses to assess any 
influence of allowing patients to be enrolled on- or off-cycle on treatment comparisons.  
Additional changes were implemented to include analyses based on microbiology samples collected 
with throat swabs. The plan was amended two additional times (dated 07 June 2019 and 10 July 2019) 
to address the change in sponsorship and implement slight modifications of the mixed model and 
multiple imputation specifications. The plan was further amended (dated 02 April 2020) to revise the 
PK analysis due to the limited number of PK samples collected. The final amendment (dated 03 March 
2022) was made to clarify the exploratory analysis of MIC concentration data. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 409 patients were enrolled. Out of the 408 (99.8%) patients who received at least one dose 
of any inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic, 149 patients were in the TOBI Podhaler cohort, and 259 
patients were in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
Overall, 279 (68.2%) patients completed the 5-year follow-up: 96 (64.0%) patients in the TOBI 
Podhaler cohort and 183 (70.7%) patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort completed the 5-year 
follow-up. A total of 130 (31.8%) patients discontinued from the study including 54 (36.0%) patients 
in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 76 (29.3%) patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. Reasons 
EMA/CHMP/924748/2022

underlying the study discontinuation were administrative problems (11.2%), patient/guardian's 
decision (7.6%), lost to follow-up (5.4%), death (3.7%), physician's decision (3.7%), and protocol 
deviation (0.2%). 
The participant flow is, in general, comparable in both treatment groups. However, a slightly higher 
percentage of participants discontinued in the TOBI Podhaler group, 36.0%, compared to the non-TOBI 
Podhaler group, 29.3%, mainly driven by more patients being lost-to-follow up (13 patients (8.7%) in 
the TOBI Podhaler group vs 9 (3.5%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler group). 
Recruitment/Number analysed 
The first patient enrolled on 05 May 2015 and the final patient visit date was 31 December 2021. 
The study was conducted at 50 sites in the USA.

Baseline data 
At the time of enrollment, the majority of the patients were more than 18 years old (n=283, 69.4%). 
Overall, the mean age was 26.4 years (standard deviation (SD)=12.35); patients in the TOBI Podhaler 
cohort had a mean age of 24.4 years (SD=10.71) and that of the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort was 27.5 
years (SD=13.09). A total of 45 (11.0%) patients were of 6 to 12 years of age, including 12 (8.1%) 
patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 33 (12.7%) patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. The 
majority of the patients were Caucasian (n=376, 92.2%). More than half of the participants were male, 
overall (n=220, 53.9%) and in the TOBI Podhaler cohort (n=91, 61.1%), respectively. 
A total of 407 patients (99.8%) were diagnosed with CF; one patient had missing CF diagnosis data 
(non-TOBI Podhaler cohort) due to data issues in PortCF registry (source of CF diagnosis data). A 
quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test was performed for 358 patients out of the 407 
patients, of whom 16 (4.5%) patients had sweat test values of ≤ 60 mmol/L. Overall, 407 patients 
(99.8%) were genotyped. 
At baseline, a total of 396 (97.1%) patients had spirometry assessments. Patients in the TOBI 
Podhaler cohort on average had a FEV1 % predicted of 75.7% (SD=23.96) as compared to that of 
64.9% (SD=22.80) among patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
The mean time since chronic P. aeruginosa infection established was 7.1 years (SD=5.36) in the TOBI 
Podhaler cohort comparing to 6.5 years (SD=5.67) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
EMA/CHMP/924748/2022  
Page 9/14 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A total of 186 patients provided sputum samples at baseline for microbiology assessments. Sputum 
culture results were available for 68 patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort (of which 51 patients had P. 
aeruginosa isolated) and 118 patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort (of which 110 patients had P. 
aeruginosa isolated). The mean sputum densities for sum of all biotypes of P. aeruginosa at baseline 
tended to be similar between the TOBI Podhaler cohort (6.5 log10 CFU, SD=1.80) and the non-TOBI 
Podhaler cohort (6.3 log10 CFU, SD=1.81). The majority of patients with baseline microbiology data 
(73.8%) had P. aeruginosa isolates with MIC ≤ 8 µg/mL (74.1% in the TOBI Podhaler cohort, 73.6% in 
the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort). None of the patients analysed for Burkholderia cepacia had presence of 
Burkholderia cepacia in their baseline sputum sample. 
Microbiological results 
For microbiological assessments, sputum collected as part of routine care, including at baseline, from 
patients able to spontaneously produce sputum was used. If a patient was unable to spontaneously 
expectorate, a deep-throat cough swab specimen was collected instead (the protocol was amended in 
October 2017 to allow for the use of deep-throat cough swab specimens when patients are unable to 
spontaneously produce sputum). 
MIC 
The MIC distribution for all biotypes of P. aeruginosa at baseline and the end of each year in the study 
for FAS were presented. The trend in changes in MIC distribution over time was similar between the 
TOBI Podhaler and non-TOBI Podhaler cohorts after baseline. 
The categorical change in MIC for P. aeruginosa from baseline for the FAS was presented. The 
proportions of patients with an increased shift in MIC were 34.0% (n=16), 28.9% (n=13), 45.7% 
(n=16), 55.6% (n=15), and 40.0% (n=4) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort from baseline to the 1 year, 1 
to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 4 years, and 4 to 5 years follow-up, respectively; and 34.0% (n=32), 
37.7% (n=29), 45.0% (n=36), 49.1% (n=26), and 39.4% (n=13) of patients in the non-TOBI 
Podhaler cohort had increased shift in MIC during the follow-up visits/intervals, respectively. 
The categorical change in MIC for P. aeruginosa from baseline for the PSM set was presented. In total, 
35.7% (n=15) of patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort vs. 34.2% (n=13) of patients in the non-TOBI 
Podhaler cohort had ≥ 2-fold increase in MIC from baseline to the 1-year follow-up. Additionally, 
29.3% (n=12) vs. 42.4% (n=14), 46.9% (n=15) vs. 51.5% (n=17), 58.3% (n=14) vs. 57.1% 
(n=12), and 44.4% (n=4) vs. 30.0% (n=3) of patients had ≥ 2-fold increase in MIC during the 1 to 2 
years, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 4 years, and 4 to 5 years follow-up period, respectively. 
In total, 16.7% (n=7) of patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort vs. 13.2% (n=5) of patients in the non-
TOBI Podhaler cohort had ≥ 4-fold increase in MIC from baseline to the 1-year follow-up. Additionally, 
17.1% (n=7) vs. 27.3% (n=9), 18.8% (n=6) vs. 36.4% (n=12), 25.0% (n=6) vs. 28.6% (n=6), and 
11.1% (n=1) vs. 20.0% (n=2) of patients had ≥ 4-fold increase in MIC during the 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3 
years, 3 to 4 years, and 4 to 5 years follow-up period, respectively. 
The MIC analyses were also done by baseline medication which is defined as the inhaled antibiotic a 
patient was using at enrollment: TOBI Podhaler, Cayston, or tobramycin solution. The trend in changes 
in MIC distribution for P. aeruginosa for all biotypes during the follow-up was similar between 
participants who used TOBI Podhaler, Cayston, and tobramycin solution at baseline.

(6.9%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort 
•  Burkholderia spp.: 2 patients (2.0%) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort, 2 patients (1.1%) in the 
non-TOBI Podhaler cohort 
Based on the data presented, no clear impact of the prescribed treatment on MIC distribution was 
observed. The percentage of patients with a categorical increase in MIC was largely comparable 
between the 2 cohorts over time. However, as 81 patients in the TOBI Podhaler group and 61 in the 
non-TOBI Podhaler group were exposed to the medication in the other cohort, the observed results 
cannot be directly attributed to the treatment, and the conclusions that can be drawn are limited, 
especially as it is unclear when this happened. The MAH was asked to present the data on MIC 
distribution based on the treatment received in patients who did not receive treatment from the other 
cohort (i.e., treated with a single treatment) as a sensitivity analysis. In case a patient used 
medication included in the other cohort, the data of that patient should be censored from time of use. 
The MAH provided this sensitivity analysis and the results were largely in line with the primary 
analysis. No clear trends on MIC distribution could be observed in either group. It is acknowledged that 
this sensitivity analysis could potentially be biased, as switching to or concomitant use of the 
medication from the other cohort could be due to efficacy/resistance development.  
The results from the propensity score matched set indicate that differences in baseline characteristics, 
due to fact that no randomisation occurred in this observational study, did not impact the outcome on 
MIC distribution. However, as stated before, the criteria for matching were not clearly presented. 
No impact of the prescribed treatment on treatment-emergent pathogens was seen. 
Safety results 
Exposure 
A total of 408 patients contributed 1712.1 patient-years of follow-up over the course of the study 
(TOBI Podhaler cohort: 581.5 patient-years; non-TOBI Podhaler cohort: 1130.6 patient-years). The 
duration of initial exposure to baseline inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic medications is defined as the 
number of days in the study when patients were taking baseline medications (from the date of the first 
dose to the last dose) before switching to another medication excluding interruptions. The duration of 
the overall exposure to inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics refers to the total number of days that a 
patient used TOBI Podhaler or non-TOBI Podhaler antibiotics throughout the study excluding treatment 
interruptions. Changes from initial cohort treatment included adding a new inhaled antipseudomonal 
antibiotic to the drug regimen at the time of enrolment or switching to a new inhaled antipseudomonal 
antibiotic.  
It is worth noting that 81 patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort were exposed to an inhaled 
antipseudomonal antibiotic other than TOBI Podhaler and 61 patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort 
were exposed to TOBI Podhaler. This includes patients on continuous therapy (alternating TOBI 
Podhaler with another FDA-approved antipseudomonal antibiotic) and patients who had changes in 
their inhaled antibiotic used at enrolment.

Adverse Events 
A total of 133 (89.3%) patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort experienced at least one AE compared to 
250 (96.5%) patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. The most common AEs (≥ 10%) by SOC 
reported in both cohorts were infections and infestations (TOBI Podhaler: n=131, 87.9%; non-TOBI 
Podhaler: n=238, 91.9%), followed by respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (TOBI Podhaler: 
n=62, 41.6%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=124, 47.9%), gastrointestinal disorders (TOBI Podhaler: n=32, 
21.5%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=83, 32.0%), investigations (TOBI Podhaler: n=30, 20.1%; non-TOBI 
Podhaler: n=65, 25.1%), general disorders and administration site conditions (TOBI Podhaler: n=26, 
17.4%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=76, 29.3%), psychiatric disorders (TOBI Podhaler: n=26, 17.4%; non-
TOBI Podhaler: n=40, 15.4%), nervous system disorders (TOBI Podhaler: n=21, 14.1%; non-TOBI 
Podhaler: n=37, 14.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (TOBI Podhaler: n=18, 
12.1%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=35, 13.5%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (TOBI Podhaler: 
n=15, 10.1%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=34, 13.1%). 
The most common AE by PT reported in both treatment cohorts was infective pulmonary exacerbation 
of CF (TOBI Podhaler cohort: n=124, 83.2%; non-TOBI Podhaler cohort: n=230, 88.8%). Other 
frequently reported (≥ 10% in any cohort) AEs were cough (TOBI Podhaler: n=34, 22.8%; non-TOBI 
Podhaler: n=57, 22.0%), sinusitis (TOBI Podhaler: n=19, 12.8%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=33, 12.7%), 
hemoptysis (TOBI Podhaler: n=19, 12.8%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=40, 15.4%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (TOBI Podhaler: n=17, 11.4%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=26, 10.0%), and influenza (TOBI 
Podhaler: n=15, 10.1%; non-TOBI Podhaler: n=24, 9.3%). 
The majority of AEs were either moderate or severe in intensity. Overall, by maximum intensity, 49 
patients (12.0%) had mild, 116 patients (28.4%) had moderate, and 218 patients (53.4%) had severe 
AEs. Specifically, the proportion of patients with mild AEs was 14.8% (n=22) for patients in TOBI 
Podhaler cohort vs. 10.4% (n=27) in non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. The proportion of patients with 
moderate AEs was 30.9% (n=46) in TOBI Podhaler cohort vs. 27.0% (n=70) in non-TOBI Podhaler 
cohort. The proportion of patients with severe AEs was 43.6% (n=65) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 
59.1% (n=153) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
Twenty-eight patients had AEs which were suspected to be related to study drug, 10 (6.7%) in the 
TOBI Podhaler cohort and 18 (6.9%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort 
Deaths and SAEs 
Overall, 15 patients died during study, 3 patients (2.0%) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 12 patients 
(4.6%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. None of the deaths were considered to be related to the 
study medications by investigators. 
A total of 256 patients experienced an SAE during study, 81 patients (54.4%) in the TOBI Podhaler 
cohort and 175 patients (67.6%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. The most common SAE by PT 
reported in both treatment cohorts was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (TOBI Podhaler cohort: 
n=72, 48.3%; non-TOBI Podhaler cohort: n=152, 58.7%). Five SAEs (2 in TOBI Podhaler and 3 in 
non-TOBI Podhaler treatment cohort) were suspected to be related to study medication: two SAEs of 
infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF in the TOBI Podhaler cohort, and one SAE of hemoptysis and 
two SAEs of infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. 
Sixteen patients discontinued study drug due to AEs: 5 patients (3.4%) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort 
and 11 patients (4.2%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort. Most of these AEs were of mild to moderate 
intensity, except one AE of respiratory failure in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort and were suspected to 
be related to study drug for 3 patients (2.0%) in the TOBI Podhaler cohort and 7 patients (2.7%) in 
the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort.

The presentation of exposure was considered very confusing; as for example, the percentage of 
participants with a duration of follow-up of ≥90 days is substantially lower compared to the percentage 
of participants with a duration of overall exposure of ≥90 days. The MAH was also asked to explain the 
increase in the percentage of participants that had a duration of follow-up ≥1620 days (32.0%) and ≥
1800 days (45.2%) over ≥1440 days (18.1%) in the non-TOBI Podhaler group. The MAH agreed and 
provided an updated table where these values were included, but this did not impact overall duration 
of follow-up or summary of exposure presented. 
The MAH confirmed there is an overlap in the 81 patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort that were 
exposed to an inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic other than TOBI Podhaler and the 38 patients who 
had at least one change from the initial cohort treatment. In addition, information on when switching 
occurred for the 81 patients was provided. Switching occurred at different time points after start of the 
study. The same information was provided for the 61 patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort who 
were exposed to TOBI Podhaler and the 93 patients who had at least one change from the initial cohort 
treatment. 
The MAH was asked to present the reason for the physician's decision to switch medication in both 
TOBI Podhaler and non-TOBI Podhaler cohort, and in case resistance development is a part of the 
reason, to switch to present the MIC value prior to switching. The MAH stated that the reason for 
physician’s decision was not collected.  
Based on the presented data, 81 patients in the TOBI Podhaler cohort were exposed to an inhaled 
antipseudomonal antibiotic other than TOBI Podhaler, and 61 patients in the non-TOBI Podhaler cohort 
were exposed to TOBI Podhaler. This limits any conclusions on the safety profile that can be drawn 
from this study.The safety profiles in both TOBI Podhaler and non-TOBI Podhaler cohorts were similar. 
The percentage of participants experiencing AEs suspected to be related to the study treatment was 
similar. No new safety signals were observed. 
Overall, 5 SAEs were suspected to be related to the study medications, 4 of which were cases of 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF. Considering the fact that infective pulmonary exacerbations 
are frequently encountered in patients with CF, it is unclear why these 4 cases were considered related 
to the study medication. The MAH provided the narratives and no clear link between study medication 
and exacerbation of CF was observed. It is most likely that the patients presented with infections and 
exacerbations in the natural course of the disease. 
None of the deaths reported were considered related to the study drug, which is deemed plausible as 
most deaths were related to the underlying disease of cystic fibrosis. However, one death in the non-
TOBI Podhaler group was classified as unknown. As the cause of death is unknown, it cannot be 
concluded that this death is unrelated to the study drug. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Due to its observational nature, the study has several limitations: 
- Lack of randomisation led to differences in baseline characteristics of the disease. 
- During the course of the study, patients could cycle or switch antibiotics; however, they continued to 
be included in the cohort to which they were originally assigned, which limits any conclusions based 
on a comparison between the groups. 
Based on the information presented, no clear impact of the prescribed treatment on MIC distribution or 
treatment of emergent pathogens was observed. The MAH was asked to present the data on MIC 
distribution based on the treatment received in patients who did not receive treatment from the other 
cohort (i.e., treated with a single treatment) as a sensitivity analysis. In case a patient switched

medication to the one used in the other cohort, the data of that patient should be censored from time 
of switch. The sensitivity analysis was provided and the results were largely in line with the primary 
analysis. No clear trends on MIC distribution could be observed in either group. It is acknowledged that 
this sensitivity analysis could potentially be biased, as switching to or concomitant use of the 
medication from the other cohort could be due to efficacy/resistance development. 
No new safety signals were observed. 
Based on the information presented, it can be agreed with the MAH that an amendment of the SmPC is 
not required. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Based on the data presented, no clear impact of the prescribed treatment on MIC distribution was 
observed. The percentage of patients with a categorical increase in MIC was largely comparable 
between the 2 cohorts over time. 
No impact of the prescribed treatment on treatment-emergent pathogens was seen. 
The safety profiles in both TOBI Podhaler and non-TOBI Podhaler cohorts were similar. The percentage 
of participants experiencing AEs suspected to be related to the study treatment was similar. No new 
safety signals were observed. Based on the information presented, it was agreed that an amendment 
to the Product information is not required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

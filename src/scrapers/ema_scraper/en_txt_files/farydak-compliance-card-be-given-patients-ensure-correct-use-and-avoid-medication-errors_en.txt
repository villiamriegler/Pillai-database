Compliance card to be given to patients using Farydak 
Compliance card will ensure correct use and avoid medication errors  
Each patient treated with the cancer medicine Farydak (panobinostat) will receive a compliance card to 
ensure the safe and effective use of the medicine and to reduce the risk of medication errors. 
Farydak is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a cancer of a type of blood cells called plasma 
cells. It is given by mouth in 21-day treatment cycles on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12. Farydak is always 
used together with the medicines bortezomib and dexamethasone. These medicines are given 
according to a specific schedule but not always on the same day as Farydak, which may lead to 
medication errors. 
Confusion about the day that treatment is due may lead to over- or under-dosing of the medicine. 
Overdose can result in side effects such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting whereas under-dosing may 
result in a lack of effect. Patients will therefore be given a compliance card that will help them 
remember when their treatment is due.

The compliance card includes a box for each medicine which the patients should mark when they 
take a dose.   
The compliance card will help patients remember when their treatment is due. 
Patients should bring the compliance card to each doctor’s visit.  
If patients take more capsules than they should they should contact their doctor straight away. If 
patients forget a dose and if it is less than 12 hours since they were due to take it they should take 
it as soon as they remember. If more than 12 hours have passed patients should skip the dose.  
Patients should tell their doctor about any doses they have missed during a 21-day cycle of 
treatment. 
In case of any questions about the treatment, patients should speak to their doctor or pharmacist.

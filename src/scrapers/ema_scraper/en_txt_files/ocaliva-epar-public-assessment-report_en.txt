1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Intercept Italia s.r.l. submitted on 8 June 2015 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for OCALIVA, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 September 2014. 
On 15 August 2016, the applicant was changed from Intercept Italia s.r.l. to Intercept Pharma Ltd.  
OCALIVA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/753 on 27 July 2010. OCALIVA was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of primary biliary 
cirrhosis. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in 
combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as 
monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Ocaliva as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
obeticholic acid was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance obeticholic acid contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decision

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a rare, serious, life-threatening liver disease characterized by cholestasis 
with progressive impairment of bile flow in the liver that results in increased hepatocellular bile acid 
concentrations. Bile acids at elevated hepatocellular concentrations can be toxic to the liver. Such 
hepatocellular injury results in a local inflammatory response and is signalled early on by the secretion of 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In patients with an inadequate response to therapy, the disease frequently 
progresses to hepatic fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and death unless a patient 
receives a liver transplant (Kuiper 2010). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Given that most epidemiological studies are performed in the Western world, in addition to the rarity of 
the disease, true population-based studies in PBC are scarce. Based on well-defined and rigorous case 
ascertainment, the incidence and prevalence rates for PBC in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia 
are reported ranging from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants and 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, 
respectively (Boonstra 2012).  
PBC disproportionately affects women versus men (approximately 10:1) and is typically diagnosed in 
patients between 40 years to 60 years of age. It is estimated that 1 in 1000 women over the age of 40 are 
affected. Recent data suggest that those who are young at onset (diagnosed before 50 years of age) or 
male have a worse prognosis (Carbone 2013). Racial or ethnic differences in PBC patients have not been 
consistently identified (Al-Harthy 2012, Boonstra 2012). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the cause of the disease is unclear, genetic predispositions have been described (Hirschfield 2009, 
Mells 2011). It is believed that the disease may be ‘triggered’ by a response to a number of factors, such 
as infection or chemicals, followed by an autoimmune response (Pratt 2005).  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 9/129 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) is a specific immunological hallmark of PBC and is an 
early diagnostic of the disease (Hirschfield 2013). ALP is the predominant biochemical marker used in the 
diagnosis and treatment for cholestatic conditions. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) lacks specificity 
as it is seen in many clinical conditions; however, elevation of this enzyme in the presence of elevated ALP 
levels is confirmatory of a hepatic etiology and in particular cholestatic condition such as PBC (Giannini 
2005). In the later stage of PBC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
may also be elevated due to hepatocellular damage as a secondary effect of cholestasis. Thus, in PBC, 
especially in the earlier stages, aminotransferase levels are usually within normal limits, and if elevated, 
only minimally (approximately 1x upper limit of normal [ULN] to 3x ULN) (Lindor 2009) (EASL 2009). 
PBC disease progression can vary widely across patients, with some patients progressing to 
decompensation over a period of years and others remaining asymptomatic for more than a decade. In 
the early stages of disease, PBC patients do not manifest the signs and symptoms of illness.  
As shown in Figure 1, liver function begins to deteriorate prior to onset of symptoms. ALP levels correlate 
with disease progression, and over the first year, with and without treatment, are highly predictive of 
long-term clinical outcomes, e.g. transplant-free survival (Beuers 2011, Lammers 2014, Carbone 2013). 
Changes in ALP and bilirubin correlate with and fully capture the net effects of OCA on the primary 
pathophysiology of PBC. Persistent hepatocellular damage eventually leads to increased circulating 
bilirubin once hepatic excretory function has been significantly damaged; therefore, elevated circulating 
bilirubin is a direct result of significant liver damage. Furthermore, literature suggests that increased 
levels of circulating ALP, when occurring in patients with a concurrent rise in GGT, occurs in parallel with 
decreased expression in the canalicular space. This results in dysregulation of adenosine triphosphate and 
pH triggering continued heightened inflammatory response, and in turn results in persistent, 
cholestasis-induced, hepatocellular damage and ultimately liver failure.

Lipid abnormalities, including triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), and high density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), are observed at all stages of the disease but elevated HDLc is frequently 
observed early. With PBC disease progression, levels of total and HDLc are reduced, while levels of 
lipoprotein X increase (Loria 2014). There is no consensus that these lipid abnormalities in PBC patients 
correlate with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease (Crippin 1992, Longo 2002, Allocca 
2006, Ungprasert 2014).  
Pruritus and fatigue are the most commonly reported symptoms in PBC (Mayo 2008, Crosignani 2008). 
Neither the exact pruritogen nor the underlying mechanisms for the cause of cholestatic pruritus have 
been completely elucidated, although the autotaxin pathway has been implicated (Bolier 2012, Beuers 
2014). Pruritus may subside spontaneously when patients decompensate and develop hepatic failure, 
suggesting the pruritogen is synthetized in the liver (Jones 2012, Jones 1999). Fatigue is reported in up 
to 78% of PBC patients. Although fatigue is not well understood, it known that it is not specific to PBC, and 
it does not correlate with disease severity (Crosignani 2008). Fatigue is related to autonomic dysfunction 
in the brainstem and can be severe. Decrements in mental and physical functions can be observed.  
Osteoporosis is the bone disorder seen most often in PBC and occurs in up to one-third of patients. The 
cause of osteoporosis in PBC is uncertain. Patients with PBC appear to have “low-turnover” osteoporosis 
in which bone formation is inhibited and bone resorption is low or normal (Adorini 2009). Vitamin D 
metabolism is normal in patients with PBC except for those with jaundice and clinically advanced disease 
(Lindor 2009).  
Portal hypertension often develops in the advanced stages of PBC when patients have well-established 
cirrhosis; however, in contrast to other liver diseases, it may develop prior to cirrhosis (Crosignani 2008, 
Lindor 2009). Patients with cirrhosis may haemorrhage from oesophageal or gastric varices, or portal 
gastropathy despite having normal or near normal synthetic liver synthetic function (Lindor 2009).  
The final stage of PBC is decompensation marked by progressive liver insufficiency. Total bilirubin 
generally remains within normal limits until the onset of extensive hepatic failure and loss of functional 
liver tissue. Studies of patients with partial hepatectomy (up to 75% resection) have shown that bilirubin 
levels remain relatively normal (Helling 2006). Scleral jaundice may start to appear at a bilirubin level of 
approximately 50 μmol/L and indicates, in a cholestatic patient, that the net excretory capacity of the 
remaining functional liver tissue is failing. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are limited therapeutic options for PBC patients. Liver transplantation can significantly improve 
survival and pruritus in patients (Corpechot 2008, Lindor 2009). However, it is a complex, 
time-consuming operation with identified risks suitable only for patients with advanced liver disease, 
including perioperative and surgical complications, immunologic and infectious disorders, and various 
medical complications. Complications of liver transplant include bleeding, rejection, infection, and side 
effects from medications such as immunosuppressants. Furthermore, given the underlying autoimmunity 
that causes PBC, the disease can recur in a significant percentage of patients receiving liver transplants, 
with increasing likelihood over time (Silveira 2010, Lindor 2009).  
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid constituent, is the only medicine currently approved to treat 
PBC. UDCA improves biochemical indices such as ALP and bilirubin and delays histological progression 
(Poupon 1997, Corpechot 2008). The results of clinical trials of appropriate dose and length of treatment, 
in combination with well-controlled epidemiologic analyses, provide strong evidence that treatment with 
UDCA increases progression-free survival, with significantly greater benefit for patients who demonstrate 
greater response as measured by decreases in ALP, bilirubin and ALT. Accordingly, UDCA treatment has 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 11/129 
 
 
 
 
 
been recommended as first line therapy for patients with PBC in both European (European Association for 
the Study of the Liver [EASL]) and American (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
[AASLD]) treatment guidelines (Lindor 2009, EASL 2009).  
While UDCA has a marked impact on clinical outcomes in PBC, up to 50% of UDCA-treated patients either 
fail to respond or have a suboptimal response as defined based on various liver biochemistry algorithms. 
These criteria included a decrease >40% in ALP from the baseline value or decrease to a normal level 
(Parés 2006); ALP <3x ULN, AST<2x ULN, and bilirubin <ULN (Corpechot 2008, Corpechot 2011); and 
normalization of abnormal concentrations of bilirubin, albumin, or both. (Kuiper 2009).  
The risk associated with non-response to UDCA is substantial. A cross-sectional study using the United 
Kingdom PBC patient cohort (UK-PBC) data indicates that this lack of response is significantly more 
common in patients who are young at disease onset or who are male, presumably reflecting an 
accelerated disease course (Carbone 2013). Fifty percent of patients in the UK-PBC study who had 
presented with PBC below the age of 50 were either in a state of UDCA non-response or had already 
undergone liver transplantation. There is an increased impact in those patients with a non-response to 
UDCA (in population terms) who develop the disease when younger given their expectations of normal 
lifespan. These patients are at significantly increased risk of an adverse outcome such as a liver transplant 
or end stage liver disease (Parés 2006, Kuiper 2009, Corpechot 2008, Kumagi 2010b, Corepchot 2011, 
Momah 2012). These findings have recently been confirmed by both the nationwide UK-PBC group (Mells 
2011) and the Global PBC Study Group (Lammers 2014). 
Furthermore, while UDCA at the recommended dosage (13 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg day) is generally well 
tolerated (Hempfling 2003, Axcan Pharma US, Inc.), there is a small subset of PBC patients who are 
unable to tolerate UDCA (primarily due to gastrointestinal symptoms) and thus are at an even greater risk 
of adverse outcome if unable to remain on therapy. 
While research has been conducted on a number of other drugs (azathioprine, methotrexate, colchicine, 
D-penicillamine, cyclosporine A, chlorambucil, glucocorticosteroids), little to no consistent research 
supports the benefit of these compounds on PBC (Rudic 2012). 
Based on the totality of evidence, there is a clear ongoing unmet medical need for second-line therapies 
in this serious, life-threatening disease, as well as other alternative therapies for the small percentage of 
patients with PBC who are unable to tolerate UDCA. 
About the product 
OCA is a selective and potent agonist for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor expressed at 
high levels in the liver and intestine. The endogenous bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the 
natural ligand for FXR; OCA is approximately 100-fold more potent than CDCA at the FXR due to the 
addition of a single α-ethyl group in the 6-carbon position.  
UDCA is an epimer of CDCA without significant FXR agonist effects acting rather through 
post-translational mechanisms (Beuers 2010, Hohenester 2012). UDCA needs to be administered in large 
doses (13 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg). OCA induces transcriptional effects, thus augmenting the properties of 
UDCA. 
While several downstream aspects of FXR activation are important, the regulation of bile acid 
homeostasis primarily underlies the therapeutic rationale for FXR agonists in PBC. Activation of FXR in the 
intestine and liver leads to the following:  
1. Increased synthesis of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19);  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 12/129 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Induction of transcription factor heterodimer protein (SHP); and  
3. Repression of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and bile acid synthesis (Rizzo 
2010).  
This reduction of bile acid synthesis is complemented by the effects of OCA to increase expression of bile 
acid transporters thus promoting choleresis (Rizzo 2010). Induction of the bile salt excretory pump 
(BSEP) leads to transport of conjugated bile acids from the liver in to bile, while induction of the 
heterodimer protein organic solute transporter α/β (OST α/β) leads to transport of conjugated bile acids 
from the liver to the systemic circulation. The unique combination of decreased bile acid synthesis and 
increased transport of bile acids out of the hepatocyte serves to combat the toxic burden of hepatic bile 
acid accumulation in cholestasis. 
FXR activation also leads to anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects (Pellicciari 2002, Albanis 2005, 
Wang 2008). The description of bile acid signaling pathways, the identification of endogenous activators, 
and the recognition that certain signaling pathways are deficient or defective in hepatic disease, have led 
to the development of OCA for the treatment of patients with PBC. 
The proposed indication is as follows:  
“Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in combination 
with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in 
adults unable to tolerate UDCA.” 
As major hepatology societies and advocacy groups have recognized the name change for this disease to 
“Primary Biliary Cholangitis” instead of cirrhosis the indication was adapted during the procedure as 
follows: 
“OCALIVA is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (also known as primary biliary 
cirrhosis) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to 
UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application is submitted under the Centralized Procedure (according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, 
of mandatory scope of said Regulation (Article 3(1)) as an orphan designated product. 
With the responses to the D120 LOQ, the Applicant applied for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation.  The 
requirements of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on the Conditional Marketing Authorization for medicinal 
products for human use falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are met (see chapter 
3.7.3 of this report for discussion). 
There are no EU specific guidelines for this condition. The Sponsor received Protocol Assistance (PA) from 
the CHMP dated 17 Feb 2011 on the clinical development program and the quality registration package.  
During this CHMP PAs, several key clinical issues were discussed at length, such as chosen endpoint, 
planned inclusion criteria, length of study (6 month in the original design), and their partial character as 
dose-finding studies, as the phase 3 studies were originally planned. At that time, the CHMP expressed  
concerns whether the change in laboratory values (chosen primary endpoint) seen under the treatment 
with UDCA would lead to the same long-term outcome after treatment with obeticholic acid. The 
unfeasibility of a hard clinical endpoint such as “transplant free survival” at preapproval was 
acknowledged and it was stated that the acceptance of the proposed endpoint would also be based on the 
assessment of (historical) data demonstrating an UDCA treatment effect vs. placebo on hard clinical

endpoints. In addition, the Applicant was made aware of the fact that the acceptance of this endpoint 
would also be subject to the obligation of the Applicant to collect as much data as possible regarding 
harder clinical endpoints, such as biochemical progress based on different published algorithms, 
histology, cirrhosis related events and transplantation, along with data regarding symptomatic changes, 
evaluation of Quality of Life, and the evaluation of the fibrosis serum markers and elastography.  
Following this initial PA, the Sponsor conducted 2 follow-up Protocol Assistance procedures in 2013 and 
2014.The first focused on pharmaceutical development of OCA including GMP starting material and 
stability to support the MAA filing. The second addressed issues noted in the prior meeting with the EMA, 
mainly related to the clinical pharmacology program. 
In October 2014, a final follow-up Protocol Assistance procedure was initiated to seek advice regarding 
design of the Phase 3bclinical outcomes study (Study 747-302). In addition, the statistical analysis plan 
for the study was also addressed during this procedure, with the final advice received in January 2015.

The product is available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child resistant polypropylene 
closure and an aluminium foil induction seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of obeticholic acid is 3α,7α-dihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5β-cholan-24-oic acid corresponding 
to the molecular formula C 26H44O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 420.63 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 14/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance has been demonstrated by several common techniques in organic 
chemistry: 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometry, UV 
Absorption, Mass Spectrometry and Single Crystal X-ray Powder Diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder, moderately hygroscopic, and freely soluble in water 
at pH ≥7. It is a stable amorphous solid. Obeticholic acid has cohesive properties that help during tablet 
compression. Other physicochemical characteristics of the active substance that impact the quality of the 
finished  product  are  particle  size  distribution  which  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  content  uniformity  and 
dissolution of the tablets. 
Obeticholic acid exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 11 chiral centres. Nine of them are 
defined by the raw material and are maintained during the active substance synthesis. The manufacturing 
process defines the stereochemistry and physico-chemical properties of the active substance. The 
absolute stereochemistry of the molecule was determined by X-ray diffraction. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Obeticholic acid is synthesized in 6 synthetic steps using a commercially available well-defined starting 
material with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the 
active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered 
to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in low density polyethylene (LDPE) double bag, a secondary 
polyethylene terephthalate/aluminium (PET/Al) bag containing a desiccant (both bags closed with cable 
straps). The bags are stored inside a fibreboard drum. The materials comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (FTIR,  HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), heavy metals, palladium (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution, solid state form (XRPD), and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial 
package  for  12  months  under  long  term  conditions  at  5  °C  ±  3  °C  and  for  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated conditions at 25 °C/60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability 
testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  
Forced degradation studies were carried out on under the following conditions: acid stress (1M nitic acid), 
base stress (1M ammonia solution), oxidative (5% H2O2), oxidative with alkaline media (5% H2O2 in 1M 
ammonia solution), thermal stress (50oC, 60oC, and 70oC) and thermal stress with water (50oC, 60oC, and 
70oC in aqueous solution). 
Supporting  non-milled  pilot  stability  batches  were  stored  under  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions 
described above. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All available results at the long term and accelerated condition meet specifications. It was considered that 
the proposed limits can be accepted and do not pose any safety risk. 
The stress studies demonstrate that the active substance assay method and related substance methods 
are stability indicating and specific for quantifying obeticholic acid and related substances, respectively. 
The results of the forced degradation studies demonstrated that the active substance is stable in the solid 
state but is sensitive to alkaline, acidic and oxidative conditions in solution. This is in line with stability 
results  under  accelerated  conditions.  The  results  of  the  photostability  study  confirm  that  the  active 
substance is not photosensitive. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored at 5 
ºC ± 3 ºC in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Ocaliva  film  coated  tablets  are  formulated  as  an  immediate  release  solid  dosage  form  available  in  2 
strengths containing 5 mg and 10 mg of OCA active substance per tablet. The 5 mg and 10 mg OCA 
tablets are both yellow, but differ in their shape and debossing for dose differentiation. The 5 mg OCA 
tablet is round and debossed with INT on one side and 5 on the other side. The 10 mg OCA tablet is 
triangular and debossed with INT on one side and 10 on the other side.  
The tablet was selected as a safe and convenient dosage form for commercial product.  
The active substance has cohesive properties that help during tablet compression. Other physicochemical 
characteristics of the active substance that impact the quality of the finished product were considered 
during  development.  Chemical  compatibility  studies  between  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients 
used in the finished product formulation were performed. The results are in agreement with long-term 
finished product stability data. 
Each  excipient  used  in  the  finished  product  was  chosen  based  on  its  ability  to  impart  characteristics 
desired for a robust manufacturing process capable of producing a compressed tablet dosage form. The 
excipients are standard pharmaceutical inactive ingredients that are commonly used in solid oral dosage 
forms and are compatible with the active substance. The level of each excipient is at levels typically found 
in  non-sterile  solid  dosage  forms.  All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this 
report. 
The finished product was initially formulated as a hard gelatin capsule for phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.  As 
the development continued, a tablet formulation was developed to support pivotal clinical trials  
During  development,  the  manufacturing  site  of  tablets  was  changed  to  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturing site. No change was made in the quantitative composition of the finished product. The 
pivotal clinical studies were conducted with tablets manufactured at the earlier manufacturing site using 
the  previous  manufacturing  process.    An  in  vivo  comparison  study  was  conducted  using  the  10  mg 
tablets, along with a series of in vitro dissolution studies to investigate bioequivalence. An in vivo study 
was also conducted to compare the phase 2 capsule formulation with the proposed commercial product. 
In vitro dissolution data was also generated for the capsule formulations. The studies demonstrated that 
the clinical formulations and the proposed commercial formulation are bioequivalent. 
The  dissolution  method  was  developed  for  routine  quality  control  purposes,  as  well  as  for  making 
comparisons  between  products  during  development.  The  experiments  performed  to  establish  the 
suitability of the method as a discriminatory procedure were provided. 
 Over the course of development, the manufacturing process has been optimized with initial prototype 
batches being manufactured and subsequently transferred to the manufacturing sites to support clinical 
manufacture and commercialization. The main process steps used to manufacture the finished product 
have remained consistent throughout development. However, they have been refined as the process has 
evolved. 
The primary packaging is 40 cc HDPE bottles with child resistant polypropylene closures and induction 
seals. The components selected for the commercial primary container closure system were evaluated for 
performance, compatibility of components, and environmental protection to assess their suitability for

commercial use with the finished product. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: pre-blending, dry granulation, final blending, 
compression, and coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
No validation data were provided in the marketing authorisation application as the validation of the 
manufacturing process will be conducted post-approval according to the protocol provided. This is 
acceptable being an immediate release dosage form manufactured with a standard process. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC, TLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), total specified and 
unspecified impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(Ph. Eur.), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. However, the CHMP recommended that a second identification method for OCA 
be developed and validated as TLC is an outdated and inaccurate method. Satisfactory information 
regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released onto the market based on the -approved release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data to support the proposed shelf-life in the commercial packaging have been generated using 
5 mg and 10 mg white OCA tablets) and yellow commercial image OCA tablets packaged in 40 cc and 85 
cc HDPE bottles. The use of white OCA tablets is appropriate as the change of colour has no impact on the 
stability of the tablets. Stability data from the finished product stored under long term conditions for up 
to 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. All data collected to date have met the commercial 
specification. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, total specified and unspecified 
impurities, dissolution, water content, and microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. All stability data provided under long term and accelerated conditions met the specification. No 
significant changes have been observed. 
In addition, forced degradation studies were performed to understand major degradation products arising 
from the active substance, when exposed to stress conditions. Stress testing involving forced degradation 
with acid, base, oxidation, and heat/thermal conditions in solution was conducted on one batch of each 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 18/129 
 
 
 
 
 
strength. The results of the forced degradation studies demonstrate that the finished product is stable 
when exposed to alkaline conditions but are sensitive to acidic, oxidative and thermal conditions in 
solution. 
Photostability was evaluated in accordance with ICH guideline Q1B “Stability Testing: Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products” using 1 batch of each strength. No significant changes 
were observed in any test attribute. The finished product, therefore, is not photosensitive and does not 
require any special protection from light during storage. 
The proposed hold period for bulk tablets is 12 months in double LDPE bags, sealed with bag ties, inside 
an HDPE container. The hold period is supported by stability data of bulk tablets held in simulated bulk 
tablet storage conditions. Stability data has been collected up to 12 months  stored in double LDPE bags, 
sealed with bag ties, inside a fibreboard box that was held in the warehouse at controlled ambient 
temperature (15°C to 25°C). Stability data demonstrate that bulk OCA tablets remain stable throughout 
the proposed 12 month hold time period. A minor increase in one of the impurities is observed that is 
consistent with that observed for OCA tablets in long-term (25 °C/60% RH) stability studies in the 
commercial container closure system. A 12-month hold time period for bulk OCA tablets is therefore 
justified. 
The stability studies have demonstrated that the dissolution profiles of both the 5 mg and 10 mg OCA 
tablets have not changed during storage at both 25 ºC / 60% RH and 40 ºC / 75% RH and as such, no test 
for polymorphic form is included in the finished product specification. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Cholic acid is the only substance of human or animal origin used. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of 
cholic acid used in manufacturing process is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 19/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 A second identification method for OCA should be developed and validated as TLC is an outdated and 
inaccurate method.  
Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.7.  Introduction 
OCA has been tested in in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies to evaluate its pharmacological activity and 
efficacy in liver and metabolic diseases. The nonclinical pharmacology profile indicated that OCA is a 
potent and selective FXR agonist that acts as an anticholestatic, antifibrotic, and anti-inflammatory agent 
with hepatoprotective properties and that lacks untoward pharmacology effects in nonclinical safety 
models. 
Secondary pharmacology studies (non-GLP) demonstrated other potential beneficial effects of OCA on the 
liver, and supported extra-hepatic antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities.  
Safety pharmacology studies evaluated the potential for OCA to cause safety-related, unintended 
pharmacologic effects. In vitro studies assessed the effects of OCA on hERG channel currents and hERG 
binding to tracer ligand. In vivo safety pharmacology studies assessed neurological, respiratory, and 
gastrointestinal (GI) effects in rats, and cardiovascular effects in beagle dogs. 
2.2.8.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The nonclinical pharmacology profile indicated that OCA is a potent agonist for FXR and was 
approximately 100-fold more potent than CDCA, with EC50 values from 44 to 100 nM. 
OCA did not bind to the other receptors (in particular with nuclear receptors involved in metabolic 
pathways), channels or transporters that were tested, with the exception of weakly activating the bile 
acid-activated G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (EC50 = 20 μM). 
The glyco- and tauro-conjugated derivatives of OCA are able to activate FXR, with an activity similar to 
the parental compound OCA, and do not show any activity for 14 different nuclear receptors tested.  
Upon oral administration, OCA functions as a bile acid and signaling molecule in several pathways 
modulated by FXR. Also, OCA treatment modulated the expression of genes regulating lipid and glucose 
metabolism. Direct anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immune-modulatory effects of OCA were 
demonstrated in test systems such as cultured human hepatic stellate cells, mouse primary hepatocytes 
and human immune cells. 
In a rat model of acute cholestasis, co-infusion of OCA with LCA fully reversed impairment of bile flow and 
protected against acute liver cell necrosis. In a rat model of liver fibrosis, co-administration of OCA and 
TAA significantly inhibited the progression of fibrosis and therapeutic administration of OCA reversed 
established fibrosis and cirrhosis. OCA improves portal hypertension in two different rat models of 
cirrhosis by decreasing intrahepatic vascular resistance. This hemodynamic effect relates to increased 
intrahepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity by pathways that differ depending on the aetiology 
of cirrhosis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 20/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology studies were conducted in animal models of diet-induced metabolic syndrome 
and in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. It has been shown that OCA not only regulates 
endogenous bile acid synthesis but also activates protective pathways in hepatocytes challenged with 
toxic xenobiotics. Thus, secondary pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that OCA had beneficial 
effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, liver steatosis and inflammation, visceral fat, bladder alterations, 
diabetes- and obesity-related renal disease, and vascular tone in animal models of disease. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Several safety pharmacology studies have evaluated the neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary and 
gastrointestinal effects of OCA. In study 070927.JPQ to assess the effects of OCA on the hERG channel 
current, the concentration of 300 μM caused a disruption of the cell/patch recordings. At 82.8 μM OCA, 
hERG channel currents were slightly reduced. At 8.3 μM, a small difference in the magnitude of the hERG 
current was noted when compared to vehicle, but this is not clearly a test substance-related effect. 
Therefore, it is considered that OCA does not block hERG channels. Also, in patients treated with 50 mg 
of OCA, the plasma concentrations were around 160 ng/ml or 380 nM. This means that the safety margin 
between therapeutic plasma concentration and hERG channel block is greater than 218 fold. Indeed, in a 
cardiovascular safety study in dogs, the no-observable-effect level (NOEL) for OCA occurred at the 
highest dose tested (20 mg/kg), and no noteworthy effects were found. 
Oral administration of OCA, up to 120 mg/kg, did not produce any apparent neuro-pharmacological or 
toxicological effects, changes in pulmonary function or GI propulsion, or biologically relevant effects on 
body temperature in Sprague-Dawley rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.9.  Pharmacokinetics 
The synthesis, conjugation, secretion, enterohepatic circulation/distribution and excretion of bile acids 
has been reviewed (Lefebvre et al., 2009 Hofmann and Hagey, 2014). The pharmacokinetic studies to 
assess the OCA employed validated methods of analysis using either liquid-liquid or protein 
precipitation-based extraction methods, C18 reverse-phase HPLC and triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS with 
ion transitions appropriate for OCA, glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA. 
Absorption of OCA was evaluated in a single-dose radiolabel study in rats and in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs.  
The absorption of OCA in oral administration studies was rapid, with a Tmax ranging from 0.25 hour to 1 
hour in mice, 0.25 hour to 2 hours in rats, 1 hour to 2 hours in rabbits and 0.5 hour to 4 hours in dogs. 
Formation of conjugates of OCA, tauro-OCA and glyco-OCA, was observed in all studies. The Tmax for 
these conjugates was longer, approximately 2 hours to 24 hours across species. 
Studies in mice revealed that, for both sexes, exposure to OCA and tauro-OCA generally increased 
proportionally or more than proportionally with increasing dosage and OCA exposure was higher in 
females than in males while exposure to tauro-OCA was similar in male and female mice. AUC ranged 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 21/129 
 
 
 
 
 
from less than 2-fold to approximately 6-fold. Cmax tended to be approximately 2-fold higher for females 
than males. Exposure to tauro-OCA was much greater than exposure to OCA for both sexes. Exposure to 
the glyco-conjugate was minimal and detected only at the high dose. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in rats include 2 absorption/metabolism studies, unlabeled and radiolabeled, 4 
studies ranging in duration from 14 days to 24 months and one study during embryo-fetal development 
in pregnant rats. The oral administration of OCA in rats resulted in systemic exposure to the parent and 
tauro-OCA and glyco-OCA. Exposures to each analyte generally increased in proportion to increasing 
dose, with a low accumulation of OCA (<6-fold) and higher accumulation of tauro-OCA (5.9-10-fold). 
Exposure to glyco-OCA was negligible compared to OCA exposure. No conclusive data were obtained 
regarding the exposure in male and female rats, since in some studies no difference in exposure in both 
sex were observed while in other differences were seen. 
The pharmacokinetics of obeticholic acid was also studied in 3 embryo/fetal development studies in the 
rabbit. In these studies, exposure generally increased proportionately with increasing dose, with systemic 
exposure to OCA and glyco-OCA in roughly equivalent amounts and with negligible exposure to 
tauro-OCA.  
In dogs, the pharmacokinetics of OCA was evaluated in 3 GLP studies lasting 7 days to 9 months and 1 
non-GLP crossover study lasting 7 days in each period. Systemic exposure of dogs to OCA were found to 
increase roughly proportionately with dose and there was no evidence of accumulation of OCA with 
multiple doses. Also in dog, there was a little to no exposure to glyco-OCA, and there were no consistent 
exposure differences between sexes. 
Accumulation of OCA and OCA conjugates was observed in all species after repeat dosing, with a slightly 
greater accumulation of OCA in rats, relative to the mouse and dog, and this is consistent with a much 
lower metabolite/parent ratio (tauro-OCA/OCA) in the rat. 
Regarding the distribution, OCA was recovered in the liver, but not detected in bile or plasma. The 
concentrations of OCA and tauro-OCA in the liver were similar to those of the endogenous bile acids. In 
bile, the accumulation of tauro-OCA was less than 10% of total bile acids. These data suggest that 
tauro-OCA is still absorbed by active mechanisms like naturally occurring taurine conjugated bile acids, 
but the mechanism could be less efficient and some tauro-OCA is lost in the stools.  
At 24 h after dosing, approximately 96.5% of the administered dose of OCA could be accounted for in the 
feces, urine, plasma and the organs of the gastrointestinal tract and liver.  
These results suggest that distribution of [14C]-OCA is largely restricted to tissues of the enterohepatic 
circulation, with relatively little distribution to, or accumulation in, peripheral tissues. Radiolabel 
remaining in the carcass at 168 h following administration was 1.4% of the dose.  
In in vitro experimental conditions, [14C]-OCA was stable in mouse, rat and monkey intestine S9, and rat 
and dog kidney S9 fractions, and relatively less stable in kidney and intestine S9 fractions from humans. 
[14C]-OCA at 10 μM was moderately metabolized in liver S9 fractions from mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, 
monkeys and humans.  
Nine metabolites were tentatively identified by LC/MS in S9 incubation samples. 
In vivo in mice, OCA is metabolized primarily to tauro-OCA. No other major metabolites resulting from a 
7-dehydroxylation process, glucuronides, or other polar metabolites were identified. 
In rats, OCA and tauro-OCA were 84.5% and 11.4%, respectively, of radioactivity recovered in the 1 hour 
post-dose plasma sample. At 24 hours, tauro-OCA increased to 50% and OCA decreased to 37.7%, and 
an epimer of OCA was observed in plasma (7.3%). This epimer could be 6-EUDCA. No other metabolites

were identified in plasma. In feces, there were more metabolites, suggesting that they may be formed by 
bacteria in the GI tract. 
These studies in vitro and in vivo in rats confirmed the predominant metabolism of OCA to the 
tauro-conjugate. Also it’s confirmed the presence of 6-EUDCA and OCA 3-glucuronide. This latter is found 
in female rats but not in males. Conversely, OCA 24-glucuronide was observed in male rats but not 
females. 
In the rabbit, equivalent concentrations of OCA and glyco-OCA in plasma were found. Only glyco-OCA was 
tested in bile and liver.  
The major route of elimination of OCA is in the feces via biliary excretion with no elimination via the 
kidneys and urine. 
Results from the SCHH indicate that OCA, tauro-OCA and glyco-OCA has the potential to down-regulate 
of CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and OCT1 gene expression by ≥  2-fold, in line with the EMA guideline on the 
investigation of drug interactions (2012). Conversely, no induction or suppression of drug metabolizing 
enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A3) and drug transporters (OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1, MATE1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, BCRP, P-gp, and NTCP) were observed, thus suggesting 
low potential for DDIs between OCA and both CYP isoforms and drug transporters studied.  
2.2.10.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In single-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no deaths were reported. In dogs, findings considered 
OCA-related, as decrease in body weight and decrease in serum liver function enzymes, were found. The 
single dose of OCA -that resulted in no adverse effects- is high in both studies, up to 300 mg/kg in rats 
while the MTD in dogs was 750 mg/kg.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat-dose studies, several OCA-related deaths have been reported in mice and rats treated at high 
doses, ≥120/80 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. The cause of death is liver injury in both 
species, and also GI injury in rats. No deaths have been reported in studies performed in dogs. 
In study 019958 performed in rat during 13 or 26 week, one male, treated with 6 mg/kg/day of OCA, was 
terminated for humane reasons at Day 47. Necropsy findings in this male were malocclusion, red cervical 
lymph nodes, black cecum contents, sections of small intestine distended with gas and black material 
surrounding the eyes and nose. Although this death is not considered to be test-article related, this 
finding had to be mentioned in the toxicology written summary.  
The primary toxicologic effect of OCA in mice, rats and dogs is on the hepatobiliary system. Findings 
included increased liver weights, alterations in serum chemistry parameters indicative of hepatic (ALT, 
AST, LDH) and biliary (ALP, GGT, and/or bilirubin) toxicity. The relationship to dose of these findings 
varied across species. In the mouse and dog, increased liver weights and elevated serum chemistry 
parameters generally only occurred at the highest doses tested. In the rat, alterations in liver weights and 
liver enzymes occurred at lower doses than liver histopathology changes, ie, ≥25 mg/kg/day (6.5-fold 
maximum human exposure). 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 23/129 
 
 
 
 
 
In mice, single cell necrosis has been reported after 3 months of dosing at low margins of human 
exposure, ≥4 mg/kg/day and ≥12 mg/kg/day (0.9-fold and 2.3-fold maximum human exposure, 
respectively). This effect was not associated with lethality since was not reported at doses of up to 25 
mg/kg/day (12-fold maximum human exposure) in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. Thus, it is suggested 
that this lesion might resolve spontaneously with long-term exposure. 
In rats and dogs histopathology lesions only occurred at high multiples of human exposures. 
Macroscopic/microscopic alterations in rats include cholangiohepatitis, bile duct hyperplasia and 
individual hepatocyte degeneration/necrosis at 60 mg/kg/day (29-fold maximum human exposure). In 
dogs, cystic hyperplasia and/or secretion in the gallbladder, hepatocellular atrophy, and centrilobular 
hepatocellular degeneration occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (107-fold maximum human exposure).   
In these studies performed in rats and dogs, a full recovery for histopathology changes and partial 
recovery of serum chemistry changes were observed after a 14-day treatment free period. The 
histological changes in the livers of both species observed at termination of the studies were not 
considered adverse and were consistent with the hepatobiliary toxicity observed in other general toxicity 
studies suggesting that hepatobiliary injury is ongoing and fully reversible with longer periods. 
Histopathology changes in the GI tract of rat at high doses (150 mg/kg/day) were also reported. These 
changes were not seen in mice or dogs, and have been considered to be a species-specific toxicity.  
Genotoxicity 
OCA, tauro-OCA and glyco-OCA were not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and no 
clastogenic in mammalian chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In 
addition, OCA was not genotoxic in an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus assay. OCA, and its 
taurine and glycine conjugates, have been tested for carcinogenic potential in 2-year bioassays using rats 
and mice. OCA was not carcinogenic at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day (12-fold MHE) and 25 mg/kg/day 
(12-fold MHE) in rats and mice, respectively. 
Carcinogenicity 
OCA, and its taurine and glycine conjugates, have been tested for carcinogenic potential in 2-year 
bioassays using rats and mice. OCA was not carcinogenic at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day (12-fold MHE) 
and 25 mg/kg/day (12-fold MHE) in rats and mice, respectively. OCA was not considered carcinogenic in 
mice and rats under the conditions of those studies.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive toxicity of OCA was evaluated in fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, 
embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, and a pre-postnatal study in rats. Two studies are 
non-pivotal, study WIL661001 and study WIL661002, but all reproductive toxicity studies are GLP. 
The only adverse treatment-related effects on development (reduced fetal body weights and increased 
post-implantation loss) have been found in rat embryo-fetal development study at 75 mg/kg/day. These 
effects were observed in five females and as no other effects on reproductive or developmental was 
reported, these effects were considered the result of marked maternal toxicity rather than a specific 
developmental effect. At dose of 25 mg/kg/day (13-fold maximum human exposure) no maternal toxicity 
or developmental effects were found. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 24/129 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no teratogenic effects of OCA at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (40-fold MHE) in rats and 20 
mg/kg/day (6-fold maximum human exposure) in rabbits.

Therefore obeticholic acid is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.2.12.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological properties of bile acids including that of obeticholic acid are well documented in 
numerous scientific publications.  
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted although OCA is also intended to be 
administered together with UDCA. The applicant clarified during the procedure that the ability of OCA to 
decrease bile acid synthesis and increase bile acids secretion is mainly driven by transcriptional 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 25/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mechanisms mediated by FXR. Instead, post-transcriptional mechanisms (e.g. decrease of the 
concentration of hydrophobic bile acids, stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion, putatively via Ca(2+)- and 
protein kinase C-alpha-dependent mechanisms) would be responsible for UDCA effects. Both substances 
may share "ancillary" overlapping actions i.e. NF-kB transcription, BSEP, for which however a clear 
understanding is not yet reached. Published data are inconclusive in unequivocally confirm/exclude the 
potential in vivo target (FXR) interaction between OCA and UDCA. However, based on clinical results from 
2 Phase IIa studies co-administration of OCA and UDCA is not expected to produce any relevant 
interference. Finally, the different mechanism of action between OCA and UDCA reflects into some 
clinically relevant differences (e.g., different dosages, different behaviour on circulating bile acids). 
In the toxicology studies, the target organs were on the hepatobiliary system (liver, bile duct and gall 
bladder), similar to the toxicity of other bile acids as CDCA and DCA. Findings included increased liver 
weights, alterations in serum chemistry parameters indicative of hepatic (ALT, AST, LDH) and biliary 
(ALP, GGT, and/or bilirubin) toxicity. All changes were reversible with discontinued dosing, and are 
consistent with and predict the dose-limiting toxicity in humans. Similar to nonclinical species, signs of 
toxicity occur in patients with PBC at doses that are 5-fold higher than the proposed maximum dose of 10 
mg, and toxicity would not be expected at therapeutic doses. Thus, the main toxicity finding 
(hepatobiliary effects) in nonclinical species is predictive of toxicity in human populations at similar 
therapeutic margins. 
In rats treated with high dose of OCA, effects in GI system were also found but can be considered to be 
a species-specific toxicity. 
Obeticholic acid, and its conjugate glyco-OCA, were found no genotoxic and they have not mutagenic 
potential. No statistically significant increases in numerical aberrations were observed in any test-article 
treated cultures.  
There were no teratogenic effects of OCA at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (40-fold MHE) in rats and 20 
mg/kg/day (6-fold maximum human exposure) in rabbits. 
On the other hand, in the submitted study WIL661004 in rabbits, the Company set the NOAEL at 20 
mg/kg/day. However this cannot be considered correct since an abortion occurs in a female in the 9 
mg/kg/day treatment group, and although the applicant states that is not related with treatment, the 
NOAEL must be established at 3 mg/kg/day. 
Although no specific studies have been done to assess the presence of OCA or conjugates in breast milk, 
tauro-OCA exposure was measured in nursing rat pups on postnatal Day 10. This suggests the transfer of 
OCA or tauro-OCA during lactation. Appropriate statements have been included into the SmPC. 
No potential carcinogenicity and no effects in reproduction and development have been reported for OCA. 
Based on the environmental risk assessment OCA is not expected to pose a risk to the environment  
2.2.13.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted on obeticholic acid are considered to be sufficient in the context of this 
marketing authorisation application. Relevant information such as the observed toxicity on the 
hepatobiliary system at supra-therapeutic doses in repeat dose toxicity studies are outlined in the SmPC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
OCA clinical pharmacology program includes: characterization of the PK through single- and 
multiple-dose studies, bridging bioequivalence studies, ADME study, investigation of extrinsic (drug-drug 
interaction and food effect studies) and intrinsic factors (hepatic impairment) in healthy subjects. A 
thorough QT study was also performed. Limited data in the target population derive from PK samples 
collected in patients enrolled in phase 2 and 3 studies. The Applicant had developed i) a physiological PK 
model of exposure of OCA both in plasma (systemic) and in the liver; and ii) a model to investigate 
relationships between OCA exposure and PD endpoints.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
A wide range of OCA doses were assessed in the clinical development program: single dose (5 mg to 500 
mg) and multi-dose (5 mg to 250 mg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 31/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following single-dose administration, OCA was rapidly absorbed followed by extensive conjugation to 
glycine and taurine to form glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA, consistent with the endogenous primary bile acid, 
CDCA.  
PK exposure of OCA and its conjugates generally increased dose proportionally based on AUC0-24 and 
Cmax up to 100 mg.

Table 1: Mean (CV%) Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Parameters for OCA, Glyco-OCA, 
Tauro-OCA, and Total OCA by Dose 
Convergent observations suggest that the PK profile(s) of OCA are consistent with those of endogenous 
bile acids:  
•  The PK profile is consistent to the natural endogenous bile acid CDCA and includes extensive 
conjugation to glycine and taurine along with significant enterohepatic recirculation.  
• 
Following single-dose administration of OCA at 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg (study 747-102) and at 5 mg, 
10 mg, and 25 mg (study747-105), PK exposure of OCA and its conjugates generally increased dose 
proportionally based on AUC0-24 and Cmax.  
•  OCA was shown to be rapidly absorbed and typically reached maximum concentrations between 1 to 
4 hours after the administration. 
•  Steady-state concentrations of OCA and its conjugates were achieved by Day 13 (9 days after 
starting daily administration of OCA in the multiple-dose phase [study747-105]).  
•  There was significant accumulation of glyco-OCA (3- to 7-fold) and tauro-OCA (4- to 18-fold) with 
minimal accumulation of OCA (approximately 2-fold) after daily administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 33/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The exposure of total OCA after daily administration was primarily made up of glyco-OCA and 
tauro-OCA with minimal contribution of OCA, indicating that the majority of total OCA plasma 
exposure with repeat dosing is primarily due to the conjugates.  
•  Exposure levels of total OCA were on average less than 20% of the steady-state concentration 2 
weeks after cessation of dosing.  
Maximum plasma exposure and overall exposure (AUC) of OCA and total OCA were generally consistent 
across studies in healthy subjects, albeit a high degree of variability within each study was observed. The 
high degree of variability is consistent with the low bioavailability of endogenous bile acids.  
Bioequivalence  
Two bioequivalence (BE) studies were performed: Study 747-115 (conducted to assess the BE of the OCA 
10 mg clinical tablet relative to the OCA 10 mg commercial image tablet) and Study 747-116 (conducted 
to assess the BE of the OCA 10 mg capsule relative to the OCA 10 mg commercial image tablet). The 
obtained results were within the CI, thus demonstration BE of both formulations. 
Influence of food 
A preliminary assessment of the effect of a meal on the PK of OCA and its conjugates was performed in 
Japanese healthy volunteers in Study D8601002. This study showed that OCA was rapidly absorbed and 
reached median maximum plasma OCA concentrations within 0.75 to 1.5 hours. There was significant 
enterohepatic recirculation of OCA and its conjugates with secondary absorption peaks observed after a 
meal and AUC increased minimally with food. 
The effect of food (high-fat meal) on rate and extent of OCA absorption was further examined in Study 
747-104, whereby single doses of 10 mg and 25 mg OCA were administered to healthy subjects under 
fasting and fed conditions.  
Thirty two healthy subjects were given a single 10 mg dose of OCA under fasting and fed conditions in a 
crossover manner. Extensive PK plasma samples were collected up to 216 hours (10 days) after the 
administration of OCA (10 mg) to characterize the PK of OCA and its conjugates under fasted and fed 
conditions

•  Plasma exposure of OCA and glyco-OCA was marginally higher under fed conditions (approximately 
15% higher) and is not expected to be clinically meaningful  
•  Plasma exposure of tauro-OCA was slightly lower under fed conditions (approximately less than 5%) 
and is not expected to be clinically meaningful  
•  OCA was found to be safe and well tolerated  
•  OCA may be administered without regard to meals  
Due to the drug’s physiochemical properties and high plasma protein binding, the tissue distribution of 
OCA and its conjugates are limited to blood except for organs (eg, kidney) that are capable of transporting 
OCA.  
Distribution 
OCA, glyco-OCA, and tauro-OCA are all highly protein bound (>99%). Results from the ADME study 
showed that there was minimal distribution of radioactivity into whole blood. Therefore, OCA and its 
metabolites are mainly confined in the plasma. The volume of distribution of obeticholic acid is 618L.  The 
volume of distributions of glyco- and tauro-obeticholic acid has not been determined.  
Elimination 
Mass balance data confirmed that the primary route of elimination is through the feces, while a minor 
percentage was recovered from the urine.  
Following a single oral dose of 25 mg [14C]-OCA, a mean of 75.1% (range 28.30% to 97.5%), of the 
radioactivity administered was recovered by the end of the sampling period (504 hours post-dose). An 
average of 2.83% (range 1.57% to 4.00%) of the total radioactivity was recovered from the urine, and 
the majority of drug-related material in the urine was recovered within the first 312 hours after 
investigational product administration. An average of 72.3% (range 25.2% to 95.9%) was recovered 
from faeces by 504 hours post-dose; however, because only 1 subject had achieved a cumulative 
recovery of greater than 90% at 504 hours, the other 7 subjects conducted additional home fecal 
collections beyond 504 hours post-dose (7/8 subjects until 816 hours, 3/8 subjects until 888 hours 
post-dose and 2/8 subjects until 1152 hours post-dose). Across the entire collection period (up to 1152 
hours post-dose), between 73.2% and 107% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces. 
The majority of drug-related material in the feces was recovered within 552 hours of dosing with 
investigational product.  
Total recovery (urine and feces combined) from each of the subjects ranged from 76.31% to 111.28% of 
the administered radioactivity.  
In Study 747-113, the presence of the primary metabolites, glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA was confirmed 
using LC/MS/MS technique (XBL 14830). In addition, two glucuronide metabolites were also identified in 
the 3-position (OCA-3 glucuronide) and 24-position (OCA-24-glucuronide). The presence of the two 
glucuronide metabolites appeared to be less than 10% based on radioactivity; however, since glyco-OCA 
and tauro-OCA accumulate after daily administration, the relevant exposure levels of the two 
glucuronides were assessed in plasma from Study 747-105 (XBL 14830) after daily administration of OCA 
10 mg. The relative exposure of the OCA-3 glucuronide was approximately 20% and therefore required 
toxicological qualification. However, activity of OCA-3 glucuronide on FXR is low suggesting that its 
clinical significance is minimal. The relative exposure of OCA-24-glucuonide is less than 5% and not

clinically relevant. Of note, glucuronides are not generally of safety concern as glucuronidation renders 
drugs more polar and water soluble, which enhances elimination from the body.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The dose proportionality of concentration-dependent parameters (Cmax and AUC) following single-dose 
and multiple-dose administration of OCA was assessed using a power model. Dose proportionality was 
concluded if the 90% CI of β included the value 1 and was statistically different from 0.  
Following single-dose administration, dose-proportionality was concluded for all parameters and all 
analytes with the exception of AUCt for OCA (likely due to higher variability in the 5-mg dose group). 
Following multiple-dose administration, dose-proportionality was concluded for the parent drug only. For 
the conjugates and total OCA, peak and total systemic exposure increased more than proportionally with 
dose.  
Table 3: Results of Dose-Proportionality Assessment 
Time dependency 
Single Dose  
Following single-dose administration of OCA at 5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg, PK exposure of OCA and its 
conjugates increased dose proportionally based on AUC0-24 and Cmax.

OCA was rapidly absorbed and conjugated to glycine and taurine to form glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA, 
respectively. Overall exposure (AUC) for glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA was 5- and 2-fold higher, 
respectively, relative to OCA.  
Multiple Dose  
Steady-state concentrations of OCA and its conjugates were achieved by Day 13 (9 days after starting 
daily administration of OCA in the Multiple-Dose Phase).  
There was significant accumulation of glyco-OCA (4- to 7-fold) and tauro-OCA (4- to 14-fold) with 
minimal accumulation of OCA (approximately 2-fold).  
The exposure of total OCA was primarily made up of glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA with minimal contribution 
of OCA, indicating that the majority of total OCA plasma exposure with repeat dosing is primarily due to 
the conjugates. Exposure levels of OCA and its conjugates were on average less than 20% of the 
steady-state concentration of OCA (Day 14 of daily administration) 2 weeks after cessation of dosing. 
Urinary excretion of OCA and its conjugates was minimal (<1%). 
A comparison of the pharmacokinetics of OCA and total OCA in healthy subjects after a single dose of OCA 
was studied in the following studies: 747-102, D8601002, 747-104, 747-105, 747-115, and 747-116. 
OCA was shown to be rapidly absorbed and typically reached maximum concentrations between 1 to 4 
hours after the administration of OCA. Maximum plasma exposure and overall exposure (AUC) of OCA and 
total OCA were generally consistent across studies in healthy subjects albeit a high degree of variability 
within each study was observed.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The pharmacokinetics of OCA and total OCA were studied in a subgroup of patients with PBC in Study 
747-205 after a 10 mg dose of OCA. The PK profile of OCA and its conjugates were evaluated over the first 
6 hours after the last dose administration of OCA (Week 8). A comparison of the steady-state PK profile 
of total OCA from Study 747-205, patients with PBC, versus healthy subjects (Study 747-105, 14 days of 
daily administration) showed a similar profile overall but modestly higher systemic exposure for patients 
with PBC (Figure 3). However, the limited number of subjects and the high variability in the systemic 
exposures limits the interpretation of these results.  
A summary of the PK parameters for OCA, glyco-OCA, tauro-OCA, and total OCA from Study 747-205 are 
presented in Table 5.

The PK of OCA was also characterized in Study 747-301 using trough concentrations after daily 
administration of OCA at Month 6 and Month 12 of therapy (Table 6). Although there is limited PK data 
from Study 747-301, higher systemic exposure of total OCA was observed for the 10 mg dose relative to 
the 5 mg dose. Trough concentrations appeared to be approximately dose proportional at Month 12 but 
slightly less than dose proportional at Month 6 which is most likely due to significant variability in the PK 
of OCA (due to high extraction and enterohepatic recirculation).

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The effects of renal impairment in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease have not been studied; 
however, OCA is not eliminated by the kidneys and is not expected to influence the PK of OCA.  
In Study 747-113 using radiolabelled OCA, less than 3% of the dose was excreted in urine. These results 
are consistent to results observed in Studies 747-102, 747-103, and 747-105.  
A population PK model was developed to characterize the plasma PK of OCA and its conjugates in healthy 
volunteers, patients with PBC, and special populations using population PK modeling. This model was 
used to identify relevant covariates (ie, age, sex, race, body weight, markers of liver and renal function as 
well as daily doses). Renal function was not found to be a significant predictor of OCA exposure. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The systemic (plasma) concentrations of OCA have been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment after 
a single dose of OCA (10 mg) (747-103) and after daily administration (10 mg and 25 mg) in patients with 
portal hypertension (cirrhosis) in 747-204.  
As expected with a bile acid analog, significantly higher systemic exposure (AUC) of total OCA was 
observed in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (4-fold and 17-fold greater exposure 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively) (Figure 4). The least square mean (LSM) 
ratio of OCA and total OCA for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment from Study 
747-103 are presented in Table 7. Of note, the plasma exposure of total endogenous bile acids were 
approximately 1.6-, 6.4-, and 12.7-fold greater in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic 
impairment relative to subjects with normal liver function in Study 747-103.  
Consistent with these findings, systemic exposure of total OCA was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis 
(portal hypertension) in Study 747-204 relative to healthy subjects (747-105) which is consistent with 
what was observed in Study 747-103.

included all Day 7/EOT dosing between Days 6 and 12.  
The mean plasma concentration versus time curves for OCA and total OCA plotted on semi-logarithmic 
scale were approximately parallel, indicating that elimination was not affected by hepatic impairment. No 
differences in Tmax of OCA were found in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment relative to 
subjects with normal hepatic function, suggesting no changes in the rate of absorption of OCA. 
Furthermore, no clinically relevant differences in tmax of glyco-OCA or tauro-OCA were found suggesting 
that the rate of formation and reabsorption of the conjugates during enterohepatic recirculation is not 
altered in subjects with hepatic impairment (Table 8).

Fasting Conditions (Studies with Hepatically Impaired Population) 
Mean peak (Cmax) and overall (AU0-t and AUC0-24) plasma exposures increased with increasing severity 
of hepatic impairment for OCA and total OCA. While, the higher peak and overall exposure was not 
considered significant in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal 
hepatic function, there were substantially higher exposures in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment.  
Simulations for Prediction of Liver Exposure  
The pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate the overall mean concentration-time profile of total OCA 
in plasma and liver in subjects from Study 747-103 (single 10 mg dose of OCA). The observed and 
predicted plasma (systemic) exposure and the predicted liver exposure of total OCA are presented in 
Figure 6.

Figure 6: Observed and Predicted Systemic and Predicted Liver Exposure of Total OCA for 
Subjects with Mild, Moderate, and Severe Hepatic Impairment and Healthy Subjects (Study 
747-103)) 
The physiologic PK model adequately predicted the systemic exposure of OCA for healthy subjects and 
subjects with hepatic impairment highlighting the predictability of the model and the suitability to predict 
exposures in physiologic compartments including the liver. It is of note that based on the model, liver 
exposure of OCA in patients with hepatic impairment was similar to that in healthy subjects. This is likely 
due to the decreased hepatic uptake of OCA and its conjugates, portal systemic shunting, decreased 
anatomical/functional liver volume, and an increase in taurine conjugation. Based on the above 
predictions, the marked increase in systemic exposure to OCA in subjects with hepatic impairment is not 
likely to result in liver toxicity.  
• 
Other Intrinsic Predictors of OCA Exposure  
To identify other covariates that are the predictors of OCA exposure, a population PK model was 
developed to characterize the plasma PK of OCA and its conjugates in healthy volunteers, patients with 
PBC, and special populations using population PK modeling. The population PK model of OCA and its 
Assessment report

conjugates was used to identify relevant covariates (ie, age, sex, race, body weight, markers of liver and 
renal function as well as daily doses).  
The empirical population PK model was developed based on concentration-time profiles of OCA, 
glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA collected in 16 clinical studies in which OCA was orally administered to healthy 
volunteers, patients with PBC, as well as special populations (747-101, 747-102, 747-103, 747-104, 
747-105, 747-107, 747-108, 747-109, 747-110, 747-111, 747-112, 747-114, 747-115, 747-116, 
747-204, and 747-205).  
A schematic representation of the empirical population PK model is presented in Figure 7. This model 
included a central compartment for OCA, tauro-OCA, and glyco-OCA and an enterohepatic recirculation 
“gallbladder” compartment for glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA. Between-subject variability was estimated for 
all parameters except the rates from the central compartment to gallbladder for glyco-OCA and 
tauro-OCA (KGB and KTB, respectively). A first-order rate constant of absorption adequately 
characterized drug absorption. For OCA, tauro-OCA and glyco-OCA, predictions from the model compared 
well with the observed data.  
The structural population PK model of OCA and its conjugates was used to evaluate the most relevant 
covariates (ie, age, sex, race, body weight, markers of liver and renal function as well as daily doses) 
using a full model approach (ie, multivariate).  
The final model included the following covariates for OCA and its conjugates:  
•  Hepatic impairment on volumes of distribution, rates of conjugation/deconjugation and rates of 
gallbladder emptying  
•  Body weight on volume of distribution of OCA and its conjugates, as well as rate of gall bladder 
emptying (for glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA only) during gallbladder contraction

A Forest plot was generated to represent the effect of hepatic impairment on total OCA (the sum of 
exposure of OCA, glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA) (Figure 8).

to be approximately 39%, 204%, and 218% higher than those observed in a typical subject with normal

A Forest plot was generated to represent the effect of body weight on total OCA. Individual body weight 
values from Study 747-301 were considered for the simulations. Prediction of AUC for minimum (40 kg),

typical 67.4-kg subject. 
Elderly 
The exposure of OCA in elderly patients (≥65 years of age) appeared similar to that in adult patients less 
than 65 years of age.  In clinical Study 747-301, trough PK samples were collected from subjects with PBC 
after 6 months and 12 months of dosing.  The PK population included 20 patients (16% of population) 
aged 65 years or older.  Trough OCA and total OCA concentrations (sum of OCA, glyco-OCA and 
tauro-OCA) in the older patient populations (ages 65 to 74 and ages 75 to 84) were similar to those in 
younger populations (under 65).  There were no patients >85 years of age.  Plots of the trough OCA and 
total OCA data showed substantial variability in exposures and the relative sparsity of data from patients 
≥65 years.   
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Results from the human sandwich cultured hepatocytes indicate that OCA has the potential for weak 
suppression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 which is consistent with the results for the clinical drug-drug 
interaction Study 747-109. Because FXR activation has been shown to suppress metabolizing enzymes 
and transporters involved in bile acid homeostasis, the potential of OCA to induce or suppress drug 
metabolizing enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A3) and drug transporters 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, MATE1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, OCT1, BCRP, P-gp, and NTCP were assessed 
in SCHH (ICPT-1002-3). No induction or suppression of the previously mentioned drug metabolizing 
enzymes and transporters was observed. 
In vivo 
Based on the mechanism of action of OCA as an FXR agonist and data generated from in vitro studies, the 
potential of OCA to influence the expression and/or reversibly inhibit multiple CYP450 enzymes and drug 
transporters in the liver and other tissues was assessed in clinical studies. Five clinical studies were 
conducted to assess the effect of OCA on the single dose plasma PK of substrate probes for CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and transporters (P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) 
and the effect of omeprazole on OCA PK as follows:  
•  747-109: caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate)  
•  747-110: S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate)  
•  747-111: rosuvastatin (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP substrates)  
•  747-112: omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate)  
•  747-114: digoxin (P-glycoprotein substrate)  
OCA caused either no or weak effects on metabolizing CYP450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters after daily 
administration. Taken together, these data suggest that concomitant administration of OCA would not 
likely produce clinically relevant changes in exposure of drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016

CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and/or transported by P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. OCA did show the 
potential for weak suppression of CYP1A2.   
Additionally, the effect of omeprazole on OCA and its conjugates was assessed. Omeprazole 20 mg was 
dosed daily for one week, resulting in modest increases in unconjugated and conjugated OCA exposure of 
<20% (OCA 10 mg) and <35% (OCA 25 mg) suggesting that co-administration of medications that alter 
gastric pH (proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists) will not meaningfully effect total OCA absorption.  
The effect of bile acid sequestrants (BAS) on the PK of OCA was examined in Study 747-301 (747-301 
Double-Blind Phase). A comparison of trough concentrations of OCA at Month 6 and Month 12 for patients 
taking BAS versus patients not taking BAS showed modestly lower trough concentrations of OCA at Month 
6 and Month 12 that was associated with a modest attenuation of efficacy for the 5 mg (titration) dose 
group but no meaningful effect for the 10 mg dose group. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Please refer to specific chapters above 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist and modified bile acid being developed for 
the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and other chronic liver diseases. Bile acids are 
amphipathic, detergent-like molecules synthesized in the liver from cholesterol by multiple enzymatic 
steps.  
OCA is a selective FXR agonist that targets genes that regulate the synthesis, transport, and hepatic 
concentrations of bile acids. Similar to other nuclear receptors, once activated, FXR translocates to the 
cell nucleus where it works in concert with other transcription factors to down regulate the expression of 
CYP7A1, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis.  
Activation of FXR protects against the toxic accumulation of bile acids by decreasing bile acid synthesis 
from cholesterol, increased basolateral efflux into the sinusoidal space (and thus into the systemic 
circulation), and apical secretion into bile canaliculi (and thus into the intestinal lumen). These 
mechanisms limit the overall size of the circulating bile pool while promoting choleresis, thus reducing 
hepatic exposure to bile acids. Thus, as a bile acid sensor, FXR controls bile acid homeostasis. In addition 
to suppression of CYP7A1 and bile acid synthesis, the key mechanisms of action underpinning the 
hepatoprotective effects of OCA in PBC include choleresis, regulation of transporter expression, 
anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects.  
This reduction of bile acid synthesis is complemented by the effects of OCA to increase expression of bile 
acid transporters thus promoting choleresis (Figure 10, Rizzo 2010). Induction of the bile salt excretory 
Assessment report

pump (BSEP) leads to transport of conjugated bile acids from the liver in to bile, while induction of the 
heterodimer protein organic solute transporter α/β (OST α/β) leads to transport of conjugated bile acids 
from the liver to the systemic circulation. The combination of decreased bile acid synthesis and increased 
transport of bile acids out of the hepatocyte serves to combat the toxic burden of hepatic bile acid 
accumulation in cholestasis.  
Figure 10 Effect of FXR Activation of OCA and Metabolism Enzymes and Transporters 
Responsible for the Regulation of Bile Acids in Human Hepatocytes 
The PD data are supportive of the hypothesis that OCA mediates its action primarily via FXR agonism 
wherein FGF-19 released from gut enterocytes (in response to compounds with FXR agonist properties) 
into portal circulation down regulates endogenous bile acid synthesis in the liver. OCA treatment resulted 
in a significant and a dose-dependent increase in the levels of FGF-19, and consequently a decrease in the 
levels of endogenous bile acids and C4 (a bile acid precursor). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The regulation of bile acid homeostasis primarily underlies the therapeutic rationale for FXR agonists in 
PBC and has been assessed in clinical studies, through examination of FGF-19, C4, and bile acid levels. 
Fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) is an ileal enterokine controlled by FXR and has been studied as a 
marker of FXR activation in the clinical development program of OCA. FGF-19 along with FXR activation in 
the liver inhibits the transcription of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) which regulates bile acid 
synthesis (Hofmann 2009). 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker for bile acid synthesis and thus 
CYP7A1 activity, was also studied in the development program of OCA. Therefore, the relationship of the 
three markers of FXR activation (FGF-19, C4, and bile acids,) and systemic OCA exposure was explored. 
OCA increased FGF-19 levels in all 3 double-blind studies. For Study 747-301, Month 6 was the earliest 
visit FGF-19 was assessed. Consistent with FXR agonist effects, statistically significant increases in 
FGF-19 from Baseline to Month 3 were observed in Study 747-202 and at Month 6 and Month 12 in Study 
747-301 for OCA compared with placebo. The increase observed in Study 747-201 was not statistically 
significant. The median difference (95% CI) for OCA 10 mg compared with placebo for each individual 
study is summarized in Figure 11. In the double-blind Phase 2 Study 747-202 which evaluated a range of 
doses (10 mg, 25mg and 50 mg), the increase in levels of FGF-19 were dose dependent.

FGF-19 activation was associated with a reduction in C4 (7alpha-hydroxy-cholest-4-ene-3-one) and 
endogenous bile acids. In Study 747-202, C4 levels decreased with increasing exposure of total OCA 
consistent with regulation of CYP7A1 by FGF-19 (Figure 12). In Study 747-301, reductions in total 
endogenous bile acid were observed for subjects receiving OCA titration (

reductions in total endogenous bile acids from Baseline to Month 12 were observed for the OCA titration 
(
2.86 μmol; p = 0.0010) and OCA 10 mg (
4.70 μmol; p = 0.0037). Importantly, LCA, a toxic secondary 
bile acid, remained stable across all treatment groups at Month 6 and Month 12, compared with Baseline 
‐
(absolute change ranging from -0.01 μmol to 0.05 μmol).  
‐
Mechanistically, the pharmacodynamic data are supportive of the hypothesis that OCA mediates its action 
primarily via FXR agonism wherein FGF-19 released from gut enterocytes (in response to compounds with 
FXR agonist properties) into portal circulation down regulates endogenous bile acid synthesis in the liver. 
OCA treatment resulted in a significant and a dose
dependent increase in the levels of FGF-19, and 
consequently a decrease in the levels of endogenous bile acids and C4 (a bile acid precursor) in this study.

Secondary Pharmacology 
A thorough QT study (747-108) designed according to the FDA E14 guidance was performed in healthy 
subjects in which the potential effects of OCA (100 mg for 4 days) and its active conjugates (glyco-OCA 
and tauro-OCA) on the QT interval at both therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations were 
assessed. 
Results confirmed that OCA did not cause QT prolongation at supratherapeutic or therapeutic plasma 
concentrations. Results according to Bazett’s and Fridericia’s corrections were supportive of the primary 
QTc analysis and did not show a relevant impact on QT interval. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK properties of OCA closely resemble those of endogenous bile acids, with fecal excretion as the 
main elimination route and extensive enterohepatic circulation. Following oral administration, OCA is 
rapidly absorbed, followed by extensive conjugation to glycine and taurine to form glyco-OCA and 
tauro-OCA. PK exposure of OCA and its conjugates generally increased dose proportionally based on 
AUC0-24 and Cmax up to 100 mg.

Food consumption increased OCA exposure by approximately 15%. This is not expected to be clinically 
relevant and accordingly OCA can be taken with or without food. Bioequivalence between the OCA 
formulation used in the clinical trials and the OCA formulation to be marketed was assessed in two BE 
studies (745-115 and 747-116). The obtained results were within the CI, thus demonstration BE of both 
formulations.  
Although there is limited PK data for OCA in patients with PBC, results from Studies 747-205 and 747-301 
suggest that PK of OCA is consistent to that observed in healthy subjects after similar doses (747-105). 
Obeticholic acid has minimal renal elimination with less than 3% of the dose recovered in urine.  Based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal function did not have a meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of obeticholic acid.   
Available data from patients with moderate or severe liver impairment is very limited and has been added 
as missing information into the RMP safety specification. Hepatic impairment was identified as a predictor 
of OCA systemic exposure via PK modelling. This was further assessed in a dedicated study with non-PBC 
patients/subjects with liver impairment and in cirrhotic patients (non-PBC patients), study 747-103. Data 
from these studies and additional PK modelling indicate that OCA exposure increases with increasing 
severity of the liver impairment. In patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment there was an 
increase in systemic exposure of OCA of approximately 4- fold (Cmax and AUC; LS mean) and 
approximately 10 to 17-fold (Cmax and AUC; LS mean); respectively. Similar increased systemic 
exposure was observed in the study of subjects taking 10 mg or 25 mg of OCA in patients with alcoholic 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension (moderate to severe hepatic impairment) relative to healthy subjects. 
The Applicant proposed dose recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment based on data from 
the phase 1 hepatic impairment study and PK simulations performed. These data demonstrated that liver 
exposures of OCA 10 mg twice weekly in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment would be 
approximately equivalent to a 5 mg and 6 mg once daily dose in patients with no hepatic impairment. The 
expected increase in liver exposure resulting from this posology is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve the 
liver exposures associated with hepatotoxicity observed at higher doses (250 mg).  
Therefore a modified dosing regimen of OCA in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) was included in the SmPC to establish tolerability at lower doses 
than those proposed in patients with no hepatic impairment, after which, patients may titrate to higher 
doses based on response.  The recommended starting dosage for moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and 
severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment was adapted to 5 mg once weekly.  If an adequate 
reduction in alkaline phosphatase and/or total bilirubin has not been achieved after 3 months of OCA 5 mg 
once weekly, and the patient is tolerating the medicinal product, increase the dose of OCA should be 
increased to 5 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart) and subsequently to 10 mg twice weekly (at 
least three days apart) depending on response and tolerability.   
The impact of several other intrinsic factors, such as weight, age, gender and race, was explored via PK 
modelling. The impact of these factors is not considered to be relevant on OCA systemic exposure.  
There are limited pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients (>65 years). Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, developed using data from patients up to 65 years old, suggested that age should not 
significantly influence obeticholic acid clearance from the circulation. The SmPC reflects this information 
adequately.  
In interaction studies OCA showed weak suppression of CYP1A2 which may produce clinically relevant 
increases in exposure for drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 and have a narrow therapeutic window. 
This is appropriately mentioned in the SmPC.

Concomitant bile acid sequestrants (BAS) absorb and reduce bile acids and lowered trough concentrations 
and efficacy of OCA in clinical studies and attenuate its efficacy. Therefore OCA should be taken at least 
4-6 hours before or 4-6 hours after (or at as great an interval as possible) taking bile acid resin as outlined 
in the SmPC. 
No further clinically significant DDIs are expected based upon metabolic profiles of the most widely used 
concomitant medications in PBC patients.   
From a clinical point of view, the information regarding OCA´s PD, in particular on the mechanistic of the 
anti-inflammatory effect that has been provided by the Applicant is rather limited and adds to the 
conclusion that confirmation on disease progression needs to be given within a conditional marketing 
authorisation (see also discussion on clinical efficacy). 
2.3.5.   Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has presented sufficient Clinical Pharmacology data to characterize the PK profile. Adequate 
information for the dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment has been included in the SPC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Study 747-201 
This was a 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in subjects with a proven/likely diagnosis of 
PBC. OCA doses of 10 mg and 50 mg were evaluated as monotherapies.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change (%) in serum ALP from Baseline to End of Study 
(EOS). Key secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
-  Absolute changes in serum ALP levels from Baseline to Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85/ET and 
Follow-Up (Day 99);  
-  Percentage of subjects who meet the definition of PBC responder criteria per the Paris I, Toronto I, 
Toronto II, Toronto III, Toronto IV, Mayo II, and Barcelona disease prognostic risk criteria at Day 
85/ET;  
-  Absolute and percent change in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase(ALT), gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), and conjugated (direct) bilirubin 
values from Baseline to Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85/ET and Follow-Up (Day 99). 
A total of 59 subjects were enrolled and received investigational product. Of them, 48 completed the 
double-blind phase of the study (i.e., provided assessments up to Day 85). Of the subjects who 
discontinued early, the primary reason was an AE of pruritus. 
Mean baseline ALP levels were 3.5x ULN to 3.9x ULN across treatment groups (range 408 U/L to 462 U/L). 
Results of the primary endpoint after 12 weeks of treatment were:

b Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney p-values compared to placebo. 
There was no apparent difference in the magnitude of improvement between the 2 OCA doses.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of primary endpoint analyses. Across the efficacy 
evaluations, both OCA doses, 10 mg and 50 mg, were equally effective, and no dose-response 
relationship was observed for the majority of the efficacy endpoints. 
Study 747-202 
This was a 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with a proven/likely diagnosis of 
PBC who were suboptimally controlled. OCA doses of 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg were evaluated as add-on 
therapy to UDCA. Subjects had to be on a stable dose of UDCA therapy for at least 6 months prior to 
Screening. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in serum ALP level from Baseline to End of Study 
(Week 12 or last observed ALP value on treatment).Secondary efficacy variables included the following: 
hepatocellular injury(aminotransferase and other hepatic enzymes and analytes); liver function 
(prothrombin time, albumin, and other laboratory tests); disease-specific and general health 
questionnaires (PBC-40, 5D and SF-36);symptoms (pruritus visual analog scale [VAS] questionnaire); 
and biomarkers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (various biochemical assessments of cytokines and 
other analytes). 
A total of 165 subjects were randomized to study medication as follows: placebo (N = 38), OCA 10 mg (N 
= 38), OCA 25 mg (N = 48), and OCA 50 mg (N = 41). Mean baseline ALP levels were approximately 2.5 
x ULN across treatment groups (range 275 U/L to 294 U/L).  
Results of the primary endpoint after 12 weeks of treatment were:

Treatments 
Three treatment groups were evaluated in the double-blind phase of the study: placebo, OCA titration, or 
(c) OCA 10. Investigational product was to be administered PO, QD for 12 months. Each dose was made 
up of 1 tablet.  
Patients were instructed to begin dosing on the day after the Day 0 visit (i.e., on Day 1) and to take 
investigational product with water, approximately 30 minutes prior to breakfast. Subjects were instructed 
to swallow the tablet whole and to not chew, divide, or crush the tablet. 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Allocation to 1 of 3 treatment arms occurred on a 1:1:1 ratio across sites based on a predefined 
randomization code (generated by Sharp Clinical Services [formerly Bilcare]) using an IWRS that served 
as a computer-based subject registration system at: Screening and Day 0 (randomization). The IWRS 
served as an investigational product inventory and management system. The Investigator or designee 
was required to register the subject in the IWRS and could be prompted to provide subject data necessary 
to properly randomize and allocate the subject to treatment. A randomization number was assigned 
according to the master randomization schedule and as allocated by IWRS in strict sequential order within 
the appropriate randomization strata.

subjects from the OCA titration group who were deemed eligible to up-titrate received OCA 10 mg for the 
remaining 6 months of the double-blind period. 
Dose reductions/Interruptions 
Per protocol, subjects were to receive investigational product QD the entire 12-month duration of the 
double-blind phase; however, less frequent dosing regimens (i.e., alternative dosing regimens) or

Safety Assessments: 
Safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign measurements, weight, 
BMI, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, clinical laboratory results, dual-emission 
x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Model for End Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) scores. 
Patient questionnaires (5-dimensional [5-D] pruritus, and pruritus visual analog scale [VAS]) 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was approximately 180 subjects (60 subjects in each of the 3 groups). An 
analysis of this study’s endpoint was conducted on the Phase 2 study (adding OCA to UDCA therapy) 
dataset: 9% of the placebo subjects and 40% of the subjects receiving OCA 10 mg had a positive 
response. The sample size was then calculated using slightly more conservative numbers. Assuming 
responder rates in the placebo and the OCA 10 mg groups of 14% and 40%, respectively, and based on 
the use of a 2-sided test of equality of binomial proportions at the 5% level of significance, a sample size 
of 60 subjects per group would provide 90% power to detect a difference between the OCA 10 mg group 
and placebo. Due to a screening window of up to 8 weeks, some subjects had already successfully 
completed screening procedures, met all inclusion criteria, and had been scheduled for 
randomization(Protocol 747-301, Amendment 3 [Version 3, dated 24 Sep 2012]) although the planned 
sample size of 180 subjects was met. These subjects proceeded to be randomized upon approval by the 
Sponsor. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was done using an IWRS that served as a computer-based subject registration system at: 
Screening and Day 0 (randomization).  
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the blind, all tablets of investigational product (ie, placebo, OCA 5 mg, and OCA 10 mg) were 
identical in appearance, and all subjects from all treatment groups were assessed by the Investigator for 
titration eligibility at Month 6, based on ALP and/or total bilirubin response and tolerability of 
investigational product. 
Statistical methods 
Study Populations: 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product (N = 216). Treatment assignment was based on the randomized treatment. 
Completer Population: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product 
and participated through the end of the double-blind phase (Month 12; N = 198). Treatment assignment 
was based on the randomized treatment. 
Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population: All subjects in the Completer Population who did not have any major 
protocol deviations that could potentially affect the efficacy of the investigational product (N = 192). 
Treatment assignment was based on randomized treatment.

Efficacy: Analyses for the composite endpoint were completed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) 
test stratified by the randomization stratification factor based on the ITT population. Missing values were 
considered a non-response. Statistical significance of the difference between placebo and OCA 10 mg was 
defined as a p-value ≤0.05. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint using 
observed data only. The primary efficacy analyses were repeated using the EE and Completer 
populations.  
The CMH test was also used for ALP responder analyses, disease prognostic risk responder analyses, and 
subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the ITT population on all responder 
endpoints using a logistic regression model with response as the endpoint and treatment group and 
randomization strata as factors.  
Efficacy laboratory parameters were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
absolute change and percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable including treatment group 
and randomization stratification factor as fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate.  
PK: The PK population was used to summarize OCA and bile acid concentrations. The change from 
Baseline concentrations within each treatment group was compared using a paired t-test. Descriptive 
statistics of OCA plasma concentrations and the extent of BAS concomitant exposure were provided by 
treatment group. Initial evaluation of the effects of BAS on OCA, total bile acid concentrations, and ALP 
was performed using a correlation analysis.  
Safety: All safety analyses were based on the Safety population. TEAEs were summarized by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term by severity 
and by causal relationship to OCA. Pruritus was considered an adverse event (AE) of special interest.  
Safety laboratory parameters, MRS, MELD scores, vital signs, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) 
values (absolute and change from Baseline) were summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics at Baseline and at each post-Baseline visit.  
The 5-D pruritus questionnaire values and change from Baseline were summarized by treatment using 
descriptive statistics for each domain score and the total score by visit. The pruritus VAS was summarized 
in the same manner.  
Correlation analyses and categorical summaries were presented for ECGs. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical testing was 2-sided and was performed at the 0.05 significance 
level. Tests were declared statistically significant if the calculated p-value was ≤0.05. Continuous 
variables were summarized with means, standard deviations, standard error of the mean, medians, 
minimums, and maximums. Categorical variables were summarized by counts and by percentage of 
subjects in corresponding categories. All summary tables were presented by treatment group. Baseline 
summaries also included a total summary column. 
Individual subject data obtained from the eCRFs, central clinical lab, central ECG lab, other external 
laboratory data, and any derived data were presented by subject in data listings. Data from all 
assessments during the double-blind phase, whether scheduled or unscheduled, were listed by treatment 
assignment, subject, and visit. 
The analyses described in the SAP were considered a priori in that they were defined prior to database 
lock and prior to breaking the blind. Any analyses performed subsequent to breaking the blind were 
considered post-hoc and exploratory. All analyses and tabulations were performed using SAS® Version 
9.2 or higher. The Baseline value used for the statistical analyses of quantitative parameters (e.g., for 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 58/129 
 
 
 
 
 
numerical change from Baseline analyses) was defined as the mean of all available evaluations prior to 
treatment. If only 1 evaluation was expected, the available data were used as the Baseline value. 
The Baseline value used for statistical analyses of qualitative parameters (e.g., normal/abnormal) was 
defined as the last observed value before the first dose of investigational product. 
Missing data were handled as follows: 
- 
For responder analyses, any subject who did not provide an assessment at the specified 
timepoint for the defining of response was considered to be a non-responder. 
- 
For efficacy endpoints that utilized an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, observed cases 
served as the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of missing data were 
conducted where missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). For 
efficacy endpoints that utilized the MMRM, no imputations were made for missing values.

Conduct of the study 
The original Protocol 747-301 (Version 1), dated 06 Sep 2011, was amended 3 times during the 
double-blind phase of the study.  
- 
Protocol 747-301, Amendment 1 (Version 1.1, dated 18 Jan 2012): This protocol amendment 
addressed comments raised under Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure (VHP) and was submitted in 
Europe only. It included editorial changes,  update to Sponsor contact,  correction of spelling errors, 
and clarification regarding the timing of BAS dosing,  definition of study end and dosing instructions 
regarding other antacids;   
- 
Protocol 747-301, Amendment 2 (Version 2, dated 04 Apr 2012): This protocol amendment 
addressed comments raised by Investigators and included other editorial changes and clarifications 
by the Sponsor. 
- 
Protocol 747-301, Amendment 3 (Version 3, dated 24 Sep 2012):  This protocol amendment included 
additional minor editorial changes and clarifications.  
Major Protocol deviations per category and treatment group are summarized in Table 11. Four were due 
to exclusion criterion number 3 (i.e., subjects with severe pruritus or requiring systemic treatment for 
pruritus with BAS or rifampicin within 2 months of Day 0 will be excluded).  
The deviations are as follows:  
•  Three subjects (two on placebo and one OCA titration) received BAS within 2 months of 
Randomization (Day 0) and thus were excluded from both the EE and PK populations. 
•  One subject (OCA 10 mg) also received BAS within 2 months prior to Randomization (Day 0). The 
subject was excluded from the PK population. 
•  One subject (OCA titration) had a visit schedule deviation per the Investigator; however, it is the 
Sponsor’s assessment the subject had a deviation from inclusion criterion 5 (any measure of 
contraception). One subject (placebo) was noncompliant with investigational product for >1 month 
direction from their physician to intermittently stop taking the investigational product. The subject 
was excluded from both the EE and PK populations.

Baseline data 
A total of 216 patients were included, 81% of them were <65 years of age, predominantly female (91%) 
and white (94%). The majority of the population was European (67%), followed by North American 
(29%), and Australian (4%). The mean body weight and BMI were 69.8 kg and 26.0 kg/m2, respectively,

with 82% of subjects having a BMI <30 kg/m2. The majority (93%) of the population was on UDCA at 
Baseline.

PBC Baseline disease characteristics are summarized in Table 13. In general, each variable was well 
balanced across treatment groups. Overall, the median age at time of diagnosis was 47.5 years. The 
mean duration of PBC at time of study entry was 8.6 years, with a comparable percentage of subjects with 
a duration of PBC of ≤7.5 years versus >7.5 years. There were slightly more subjects at Baseline <50 
years of age at PBC diagnosis (58%), compared with ≥50 years of age at PBC diagnosis (42%). 
At Baseline, 128 (59%) subjects reported pruritus assessed by the Investigator as follows: 43% mild, 
15% moderate, and 1% severe. The overall incidence of pruritus at Baseline was slightly higher for 
subjects in the placebo treatment group (64%) and OCA 10 mg group (60%), compared with the OCA 
titration group (53%). A total of 128 (59%) subjects reported a history of fatigue prior to entering the 
study, with the incidence in the severity of the most recent fatigue events as follows: 34% mild, 19% 
moderate, and 5% severe. The overall incidence of fatigue was slightly higher for subjects in the placebo 
treatment group (67%), compared with the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups (54% to 56%, 
respectively).

Mean Baseline laboratory values indicative of intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocellular injury, and synthetic 
hepatic function were well balanced across treatment groups. In addition, the majority (94% to 99%) of 
subjects had a Baseline INR ≤1.3, further indicative of a PBC subject population in an earlier stage of 
disease progression. However, the mean conjugated bilirubin levels at Baseline were above the ULN 
(approximately 1.5x to 2.0x ULN) indicating evidence of some hepatic dysfunction in the study 
population. 
Mean Baseline ALP values were well balanced across treatment groups (327.5 U/L, 325.9 U/L, and 316.3 
U/L for placebo, OCA titration, OCA 10 mg groups, respectively), with 29% of subjects with a Baseline ALP 
>3x ULN. Mean Baseline total bilirubin values ranged from 10.3μmol/L to 11.8μmol/L across treatment 
groups, with 92% of subjects within normal range.  
GGT was substantially elevated across all 3 treatment groups (approximately 9x ULN to 12x ULN). Mean 
Baseline GGT levels were slightly higher in the placebo group (309.6 U/L), compared with OCA titration 
(252.8 U/L) and OCA 10 mg (261.1 U/L) groups; however, it should be noted the placebo group had a 
larger degree of variability compared to the OCA groups. Hepatocellular transaminases (ALT and AST) 
were also elevated across all treatment groups, albeit to a much smaller magnitude (approximately 2x 
ULN) compared with GGT.  
Medical history abnormalities were generally similar across treatments and were most commonly 
reported in the following system categories, which were consistent with the underlying disease and/or the 
predominance of females in the study: musculoskeletal (67%), genitourinary/reproductive (61%), 
gastrointestinal (54%), hepatic (49%), endocrine and metabolic (47%), and dermatological (43%), and 
cardiovascular (39%). For the hepatic system category, the recording of PBC medical history was 
inconsistent across sites and thus does not total to 100%. 
Concomitant Medications 
New concomitant medications were defines as those medications that were started on or after the initial 
dose of investigational product. New concomitant medications that were most commonly taken overall 
(>10% of subjects) included: anilides (eg, acetaminophen, paracetamol; 29%), BAS (19%), propionic 
acid derivatives (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen; 19%), proton pump inhibitors (18%), and penicillins with 
extended spectrum (11%). A higher incidence of propionic acid derivatives and BAS was observed in both 
OCA treatment groups, compared with the placebo group. Consistent with the higher incidence of pruritus 
observed in OCA-treated subjects as compared to placebo-treated subjects, the incidence of new BAS was 
11%, 20%, and 27%, for the placebo, OCA titration, and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In the primary analysis, the OCA 10 mg treatment group was superior to placebo in achieving the primary 
efficacy composite endpoint (Figure 14). At Month 12, a total of 34 (47%) subjects from the OCA 10 mg 
group achieved the composite endpoint, compared with 7 (10%) subjects from the placebo group. The 
difference between placebo and the OCA 10 mg group was statistically significant (p <0.0001).

Missing values were considered a non-response. p-value obtained using CMH test stratified by 
randomization strata factor.  
Key Secondary Endpoint 
The key secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects from the OCA titration group achieving the 
composite endpoint at Month 12.  
A total of 32 (46%) subjects in the OCA titration group achieved the composite endpoint at Month 12 
compared with 7 (10%) subjects in the placebo group. The difference between placebo and the OCA 
titration group was statistically significant (p <0.0001).  
Both OCA treatment groups were superior to placebo in achieving the composite endpoint at all 
timepoints across the 12-month treatment period (p<0.0001 versus placebo). At Month 6, a higher 
percentage of subjects in the OCA 10 mg group (51%) achieved the composite endpoint compared with 
the OCA titration group (34%), which was statistically significant (p-value = 0.0358; Month 6 was the 
only visit statistical testing between the 2 treatment groups was performed). 
Other Secondary Endpoints 
ALP 
The LS mean (SE) absolute and percent change from Baseline in ALP at Month 6 and Month 12 for the ITT 
population is shown in Table 15.

Table 14: ALP Absolute and Percent Change From Baseline at Month 6 and Month 12: ITT 
Population (N = 216) 
Baseline is defined as the mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment. p-values for comparing 
OCA treatments to placebo were obtained using an ANCOVA model with Baseline value as a covariate and 
fixed effects for treatment and randomization strata factor. For both OCA treatment groups 
improvements from Baseline were observed at both Month 6 and Month 12, compared with placebo (p 
<0.0001 versus placebo). At Month 12, the LS mean percent change from Baseline was -33% and -39% 
for the OCA titration and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with only -5% for the placebo group.  
ALP changes over time are summarized in Figure 15 (absolute change) and Figure 16(percent change) for 
the ITT population. The y-axis of the figure also denotes 1.67x ULN for ALP, which has been shown to be 
predictive of improved transplant-free survival independent of total bilirubin.

***p <0.0001 vs placebo; p-value for comparing active treatments to placebo is obtained using an 
ANCOVA model with Baseline value as a covariate and fixed effects for treatment and randomization

criteria for females (118.3 U/L).

*p <0.0001 vs. placebo; p-values were obtained using P-value for comparing active treatments to 
placebo is obtained using an ANCOVA model with Baseline value as a covariate and fixed effects for 
treatment and randomization strata factor. Given the majority of the population was female, ALP ULN 
values shown are based on criteria for females (ULN: 118.3 U/L). Across the 3 treatment groups, mean 
ALP values at Baseline were well balanced, and approximately one-third of subjects had an ALP >3x ULN. 
Treatment with OCA (titration or10 mg) resulted in statistically significant improvements in ALP levels as 
early as 2 weeks of treatment. For the OCA 10 mg group, the mean reduction in ALP peaked at Month 6 
(at approximately 1.67x ULN) and was sustained through Month 12. For the OCA titration group, the 
mean reduction had not plateaued at Month 12 (approaching 1.67x ULN). 
For placebo-treated subjects, ALP values remained similar to Baseline values throughout the 12-month 
treatment period. It should also be noted that during the initial 6 months of treatment, the OCA 10 mg 
group had larger reductions from Baseline, compared with the OCA titration group (i.e., 5 mg), further 
supportive of a dose response between OCA 5 mg and 10 mg. 
For both OCA groups (ITT population), the difference in LS mean (SE) absolute and percent reductions 
from Baseline in ALP were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0001) at all timepoints relative to placebo. Similar 
statistically significant results were observed for the EE and Completer populations (not shown). 
Total Bilirubin and Conjugated Bilirubin 
The LS mean (SE) absolute and percent change from Baseline to Month 6 and Month 12 are summarized 
in Table 16(total bilirubin) and Table 17 (conjugated bilirubin).  Bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin data are 
summarized over the 12-month period in Figure 17 and Figure 18, respectively, for the ITT population.  
For the ITT population, the Baseline mean total bilirubin was below the ULN (19μmol/L for females, 
25μmol/L for males) for all treatment groups. Decreases in the absolute change from Baseline in total 
bilirubin were observed for both OCA treatment groups, compared with increases for the placebo 
treatment group. The difference in the absolute change from Baseline in total bilirubin between placebo 
and each respective OCA treatment group was statistically significant (p <0.01) at Month 6 and all 
subsequent timepoints (Figure 17) with the exception of the OCA titration group at Month 9.

Given the majority of the population was female, ULN values shown are based on criteria for females 
(19.32 μmol/L). 
For the ITT population, the Baseline conjugated bilirubin was elevated (approximately 1.5x ULN to 2x 
ULN) across treatment groups consistent with intrahepatic obstruction observed in PBC.

Mean Baseline conjugated bilirubin was 5.5 μmol/L, 4.5 μmol/L, and 4.9 μmol/L, for placebo, OCA 
titration, and OCA 10 mg, respectively. Both OCA-treatment groups approached the ULN for conjugated 
bilirubin (3.42 μmol/L), while placebo increased from Baseline at all timepoints. For both OCA treatment 
groups, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in both the absolute and percent change from 
Baseline relative to placebo were observed at Month 3 and all subsequent timepoints. At Month 12, 
statistically significant differences at p<0.0001 for each OCA treatment group versus placebo were 
observed.

Similar trends were observed for both total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin for the EE and the Completer 
populations (not shown). 
GGT, ALT, and AST 
Values over time are summarized in Figure 19 and individually in Table 18, Table 19, and Table 20, 
respectively.  
Baseline GGT was substantially elevated across all 3 treatment groups (approximately 9x ULN to 12x 
ULN). Mean hepatocellular transaminases (ALT and AST) were also elevated at Baseline, albeit to a 
smaller magnitude (approximately 2x ULN) compared with GGT. This is not unexpected given that PBC is 
often associated with mild and less consistent elevations of ALT and AST, which are typically more 
indicative of liver damage rather than intrahepatic cholestasis.

As shown in Figure 19, subjects treated with OCA (10 mg or titration) had statistically significant 
improvements from Baseline in all 3 laboratory parameters (GGT, ALT, and AST). Improvements were 
observed as early as 2 weeks, with the largest magnitude of response generally observed by Month 3. 
Following Month 3, the magnitude of response was sustained through Month 12 for GGT values, while the 
response was more variable for ALT and AST values. Notably, the mean ALT values for the OCA 10 mg 
group approached within normal limits by Month 3, which was sustained for the remainder of the 
treatment period. For both OCA treatment groups and across all 3 liver parameters, the differences in LS 
mean (SE) reductions from Baseline were statistically significant at all timepoints relative to placebo 
(p-value ≤ 0.0001 for placebo versus each OCA treatment group for all 3 parameters with the exception 
of the OCA titration group for AST at Week 2 [p = 0.0004] and Month 12 [p = 0.0003]). 
At Month 12, LS mean percent changes from Baseline in the OCA titration and 10 mg groups were 
respectively: GGT -50.3% and -63.7%, ALT: -35.5% and -41.7%, and AST -21.9% and -23.7% (Table 
18, Table 19, and Table 20).

females (i.e., GGT 23.6 U/L, ALT 22.9 U/L, and AST 25.7 U/L). In contrast, for placebo-treated subjects, 
GGT, ALT, and AST values remained similar to Baseline values throughout the 12-month treatment 
period. The difference from placebo was statistically significant for all 3 parameters at Month 
12(p-value<0.0001 for placebo versus each treatment group for all 3 parameters with the exception of 
the OCA titration group for AST p = 0.0003). 
Albumin, Prothrombin Time, and INR 
Baseline albumin, prothrombin time, and INR values were within normal ranges across all 3 treatment 
groups. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in albumin and INR in OCA-treated or 
placebo-treated subjects. No statistical differences between placebo and OCA treatment groups were 
observed; however, there was no worsening of these parameters over the 12-month period.

No clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences from Baseline were observed for this 
parameter (p-value of OCA versus placebo not significant for either OCA treatment group). 
Indirect Inflammatory markers 
CRP:  In Study 747-301, statistically significant decreases in CRP values were observed at Month 6 and 
Month 12 for both OCA treatment groups. The median (IQR) change at Month 12 was statistically superior 
to placebo (p = 0.0022).  
Decreases from baseline in the median (IQR) plasma CK-18 levels values were observed for both OCA 
treatment groups at Month 6 and Month 12, while increases from baseline were observed for 
placebo-treated subjects. The median median (IQR) changes between placebo and OCA titration and OCA 
10 mg were statistically significant.  
TNF-α:  
Baseline median (IQR) levels were above the ULN (8.1 pg/mL) for TNF-α across all 3 treatment groups 
and slightly higher in placebo (11.8 [10.1, 15.2]) compared to the OCA titration (10.1 [8.2, 12.5]) and 
OCA 10 mg (10.8 [8.9, 13.8]) groups. Despite having a lower Baseline, the OCA titration group had 
smaller increases in TNF-α at Month 6 and Month 12, compared with placebo, while decreases from 
Baseline were observed for the OCA 10 mg group. The differences in the change from Baseline compared 
to placebo was significant for the OCA 10 mg treatment group at Month 6 (p = 0.0002) and Month 12 (p 
= 0.0077). 
IgM: Median (IQR) Baseline IgM levels were 4.44 (3.16, 5.42) g/L, 3.73 (2.33, 5.77) g/L, and 3.51 (2.49, 
5.56) g/L for the placebo, OCA titration, and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively (IgM ULN = 2.3 g/L). Median 
(IQR) values were markedly reduced at both Month 6 and Month 12 for the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg 
groups, compared with minimal decrease in the placebo group. At Month 12, median IgM values 
approached the ULN for both the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups, with the 25th percentile within the 
normal range. A statistically significant difference was observed at both Month 6 (p = 0.0039 for OCA 
titration, p <0.0001 for OCA 10 mg) and Month 12 (p = 0.0004 for OCA titration, p <0.0001 for OCA 10 
mg) for both OCA treatment groups compared with placebo.

Responder Analyses 
ALP 
At Month 6 and Month 12 and for each ALP category, a statistically significantly higher percentage of 
OCA-treated subjects achieved the reduction in ALP compared with placebo (p ≤0.0001 versus placebo) 
(Figure 20). At Month 12, 21 (30%)and 25 (34%) subjects from the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups, 
respectively, achieved an ALP reduction from Baseline ≥40% compared with 1 (1%) placebo subject. 
Notably a decrease of ALP of >40% in patients with PBC has been associated with survival rates 
comparable to healthy matched control populations. 
Figure 20: Percentage of Subjects Achieving ALP Response Criteria: ITT Population (n = 216) 
Missing values were considered a non-response, thus, n at each timepoint was 73 for placebo, 70 for OCA 
titration, and 73 for OCA 10 mg. *p >0.0001; p-value obtained using the CMH test stratified by 
randomization strata factor. 
The odds ratios of achieving a reduction (Table 21) at Month 12 were 8.4 (≥15%), 7.8 (≥20%), and34.7 
(≥40%) for the OCA titration group and 8.2 (≥15%), 8.8 (≥20%), and 43.0 (≥40%) for the OCA 10 mg 
group. At Month 6, the odds ratios were greater for the OCA 10 mg group compared to OCA titration group 
(i.e., 5 mg) for reductions from Baseline of ≥15% and ≥20%, indicative of a dose response; however, the 
odd ratios were generally comparable at Month 12.

values within normal limits (i.e., 118 U/L [females] and 124 U/L [males]) at Month 12, while no 
placebo-treated subjects had an ALP value within the normal limits. The difference between the OCA 10 
mg and placebo groups for achieving ALP <ULN was statistically significant (p = 0.0221).

Responders Based on of Biochemical Treatment Response Criteria 
Several studies have evaluated other biochemical endpoints based on various combinations of markers of 
cholestasis, hepatocellular injury, and synthetic liver function (ALP, AST, total bilirubin, and albumin) in 
terms of predicting clinical outcomes and long-term prognosis of subjects with PBC. These endpoints are 
summarized in Table 22. 
Table 21: Biochemical Treatment Response Criteria 
A higher percentage of OCA-treated subjects responded to each respective endpoint at Month 6 and 
Month 12, compared with placebo-treated subjects. The difference between placebo and each OCA 
treatment group was statistically significant at both timepoints (Table 23). One exception was the 
Rotterdam criteria, wherein the number of subjects who were non-responders at Baseline was low (ie, 
most subjects were responders at Baseline defined as total bilirubin ≤ULN and an albumin ≥LLN). No 
statistical differences were noted for this endpoint, although the percentage of responders was 
numerically higher in the OCA-treated subjects.

a Deviation from Paris I: incorporation of total bilirubin ≤ULN instead of ≤1 mg/dL of normal total bilirubin levels. Paris 
I (Corpechot 2008), Paris II (Corpechot 2011), Mayo II (Momah 2012), Toronto II (Kumagi 2010b), and Rotterdam 
(Kuiper 2009); p-value for comparing treatments were obtained using CMH General Association test were stratified by 
randomization strata factor.  
Ancillary analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis was repeated using the EE population and Completer populations. As shown 
in Table 24, Month 12 results in both analysis populations were numerically comparable with the ITT 
population and statistically significant compared with placebo (p <0.0001).

(Placebo and OCA 10 mg, N = 134) and EE (Placebo and OCA 10 mg, N = 129) Populations 
Other secondary analyses of the primary endpoint included the percentage of subjects achieving the 
endpoint at Week 2, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 9. In addition, the 10 mg OCA group was compared to 
OCA titration group at Month 6 (Figure 21).

For the key secondary analysis, a total of 32 (46%) subjects in the OCA titration group achieved the 
composite endpoint at Month 12 compared with 7 (10%) subjects in the placebo group. The difference 
between placebo and the OCA titration group was statistically significant (p <0.0001).  
Both OCA treatment groups were superior to placebo in achieving the composite endpoint at all 
timepoints across the 12-month treatment period (p<0.0001 versus placebo). At Month 6, a higher 
percentage of subjects in the OCA 10 mg group (51%) achieved the composite endpoint compared with 
the OCA titration group (34%), which was statistically significant (p-value = 0.0358; Month 6 was the 
only visit statistical testing between the 2 treatment groups was performed). 
Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Endpoint  
Observer Data 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint for the ITT population using 
observed data only (Figure 22). Notably, both OCA treatment groups were superior to placebo at all 
timepoints, with the difference between placebo and each OCA treatment group statistically significant (p 
<0.0001) as early as Week 2 (the first measured timepoint) and then at all subsequent timepoints 
through Month 12.

ORR 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed using a logistic regression model with response as the endpoint 
and treatment group and randomization strata as factors to estimate the odds of being a responder with 
each OCA treatment group relative to placebo (an odds ratio greater than 1 favored the OCA treatment 
group).

strata factor.  
OCA titration group 
Primary endpoint 
A total of 69 subjects from the OCA titration group completed Month 6. Of these, 36 (52%) remained at 
5 mg for the duration of the 12-month treatment period and 33 (48%) who did not meet the primary 
composite endpoint but tolerated investigational product titrated to 10 mg for the last 6 months of the 
12-month period. Of the 36 subjects who did not titrate, 21 (58%) of subjects achieved the primary

endpoint at Month 6 and 8 (22%) subjects had pruritus during the initial 6-month treatment period (1 
event was mild, 5 events were moderate, and 2 events were severe). 
Figure 24: Subject Disposition for OCA Titration Subgroups: Subset of ITT Population (N = 70) 
A total of 36 subjects remained at OCA 5 mg for the latter 6-month period. Of these, 24 (67%) achieved 
the composite endpoint at Month 6 and thus had a clinically meaningful response to OCA. The other 11 
had tolerability issues, other AEs, or other reasons. Similar responses were observed at Month 9 (50%) 
and Month 12 (53%) for this subgroup. The 33 subjects who uptitrated to OCA 10 mg following Month 6 
were by definition non-responders at Month 6 (ie, did not achieve the composite endpoint). These 
subjects, who by protocol definition showed no evidence of tolerability issues at Month 6, received 
incremental benefit by uptitrating to OCA 10 mg (Figure 25).

ALP, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin 
ALP, total bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin values over the 12-month treatment period by OCA titration 
subgroup and placebo are shown in Fig 44. Both Baseline ALP and total bilirubin values were higher in the 
subgroup that titrated OCA from 5 mg to 10 mg, compared with the subgroup that remained at OCA 5 mg, 
while Baseline conjugated bilirubin was generally comparable. 
Figure 26: ALP, Total Bilirubin, and Conjugated Bilirubin Values and Change from Baseline 
Over Time: Subset of ITT Population (OCA Titration Subgroups, N = 69) 
Statistically significant absolute and percent reductions from Baseline in ALP were observed for both OCA 
titration subgroups (within treatment group comparisons based on a paired t-test.). For subjects who 
uptitrated to 10 mg, mean percent change from Baseline in ALP was -22.2% at Month 6 prior to 
uptitration, and -32.5% at Month 12, 6 months after uptitrating to 10 mg. Month 12 mean absolute values 
(216.5 U/L for those who remained at 5 mg versus 222.4 for those who titrated) were comparable 
between the 2 subgroups.  
The mean change from Baseline in total bilirubin was statistically significant at both Month 6 and Month 12 
for subjects who uptitrated to 10 mg; however, the absolute value was similar for Month 6 (9.6 μmol/L)

and Month 12 (9.9 μmol/L). This was not unexpected given Baseline total bilirubin was within normal 
ranges. Baseline conjugated bilirubin was higher in subjects who remained at OCA 5 mg (4.9 μmol/L) 
compared with subjects who uptitrated to OCA 10 mg (4.2 μmol/L). The within group change from 
Baseline in conjugated bilirubin was statistically significant at Month 6 (p = 0.0378) for the subgroup who 
uptitrated to OCA 10 mg. No other notable changes were observed for either subgroup in terms of 
conjugated bilirubin.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Due to different study durations and some differences in study design, side-by-side and pooled analyses 
provided limited additional evidence. 
OCA Monotherapy 
The Applicant claims OCA therapeutic indication as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UCDA. The 
proposed dose is the same as for the add-on indication (OCA 5 mg which could be up-titrated to 10 mg 
after 3 months).  
Data in support of the monotherapy use are those coming from 61 subjects, 54 of whom were the ITT 
population: 
-the phase II 747-201 study (43 subjects, 20 OCA 10mg and 23 PLB); 
-the subset of 18 (8%) subjects from the 747-301 study who were randomized to receive investigational 
product monotherapy as they were unable to tolerate UDCA therapy for at least 3 months prior to study 
entry.

Monotherapy versus combination therapy with UCDA  
A summary of results is reported below:  
-Baseline ALP was higher in those subjects receiving OCA as monotherapy compared with those who 
added OCA to UDCA (approximately 400 U/L versus 300 U/L; Figure below); 
-the LS mean change from Baseline in ALP was larger for the OCA 10 mg monotherapy group compared 
to the OCA+UDCA group (Figure below), however the Month 3 values were comparable (Figure below). 
For both regimens, the difference from placebo was statistically significant (p <0.0001).  
- the percentage of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint at Month 3 is similar 
(approximately 40%) irrespective if OCA 10 mg was used as monotherapy or in combination with UDCA. 
For both regimens, the difference from placebo was statistically significant (p <0.0001; Table below);  
-the ALP levels for OCA 10 mg monotherapy and OCA 10 mg + UDCA approached 1.67x ULN by Month 3.

Patients with renal impairment 
Patients with renal (mild-moderate) or hepatic impairment were not explicitly excluded from OCA phase 
II and III studies. Separate efficacy (and safety data) for these patients was provided as response to the 
D120.   
Due to the small number with patients with moderate renal impairment, only results for patients with mild 
impairment have been presented.

The primary endpoint was defined as the percentage of patients achieving ALP <1.67x ULN with bilirubin 
≤ULN and ≥15% reduction in ALP based on observed data.  p-values for comparing treatments are 
obtained using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) General Association test stratified by randomization 
stratification factor.  Patients with missing values were considered non-responders. 
For ALP and total bilirubin, N at Month 12 was 28, 19, and 15, for placebo, titration, and 10 mg, 
respectively.  The p-value for comparing active treatments to placebo is obtained using an ANCOVA model 
with baseline value as covariate and fixed effects of treatment, double-blind baseline UDCA usage 
(yes/no) and double-blind baseline total bilirubin (≤ULN/>ULN).

related with different lipid metabolism parameters (HDLc concentration, total cholesterol, etc.). Key entry 
criteria were similar to those in the pivotal study. 
A total of 33 subjects were screened, 26 subjects were enrolled and 25 subjects completed the study. In 
subjects with PBC, 10-mg OCA reduced HDL cholesterol but did not change the concentration of total 
serum HDL particles. Consistent with the clearance of cholesterol from HDL, particle size was significantly 
reduced with a mean decrease in large HDL particle concentration and an increase in small HDL particle 
concentration. Withdrawal of OCA treatment returned HDL parameters to near baseline values. 
A modest increase in LDL cholesterol was observed for the OCA 10 mg group, which was statistically 
significant from Baseline. In longer term studies, this effect has been shown to be transient with levels 
returning to baseline with extended treatment. Total LDL particle concentration increased significantly 
with OCA treatment with a mean decrease in LDL particle size; this was due to formation of small LDL 
particles. Minimal changes were observed in VLDL cholesterol, size or particle concentration. 
Total cholesterol concentration tended to decrease commensurate the decrease in HDL and the modest 
increase in LDL cholesterol. 
Components of reverse cholesterol transport were affected by 10-mg OCA treatment. Macrophage 
cholesterol efflux was significantly reduced at Week 4 but returned to values comparable to baseline at 
Week 8. This may have initially due to a decrease in LCAT activity with subsequent significant increases 
in pre-B1 HDL and small HDL which are efficient substrates for cholesterol efflux. 
Consistent with PBC, ALP and GGT were elevated at baseline and exhibited marked declines at Week 4 
and Week 8 with OCA treatment. ALT and AST were mildly elevated but within the normal range for the 
majority of subjects at baseline and exhibited mean decreases at Week 4and Week 8 with OCA treatment. 
Mean total bilirubin remained generally comparable to baseline; however, mean decreases in conjugated 
(direct) bilirubin were noted at Week 4 and Week 8. Following withdrawal of OCA treatment at Week 8, 
ALP, GGT, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin concentrations increased and either returned 
to baseline levels or had more modest declines from baseline compared to Week 8. Notably, total and 
conjugated bilirubin increased above baseline at Week 12; this was due to high levels of both parameters 
in the subject who experienced the SAE of jaundice during the follow-up period. 
LTSE studies 
After the double-blind studies, patients were allowed to enroll in their open label extension studies. The 
LTSE phases of Studies 747-201 and 747-301 remained on-going at the time of the initial submission 
(data cut-off of 31 Aug 2014).  
At entry (in studies 747-201-LTSE and 747-202-LTSE), patients from the phase II studies remained at the 
DB dose (placebo started OC at 10 mg) and in subsequent visits, if clinically indicated, they could titrate 
every 8 weeks up to 50 mg. All patients from the phase III study started the LTSE (study 747-301-LTSE) 
at OCA 5 mg (regardless of their previous dose) and at month 3 they could either remain at 5mg or titrate 
in 5 mg increments to a maximum of 25 mg in 3 months intervals.  
Efficacy variables were those from their respective double-blind periods. As in their respective 
double-blind periods, no clinical outcome variables were included in the LTSE studies. 
•  747-201 LTSE 
At the time of the initial submission, 18 out of 28 patients (64%) were continuing to receive OCA 
treatment. Twenty-three (82%) subjects participated in the LTSE phase for at least 1 year, and 17 (61%) 
participated for at least 4 years. Long-term treatment with OCA in the LTSE phase of the study was 
associated with sustained reductions in ALP that were consistent with the observed effect of OCA in the

double-blind phase of the study, showing the consistency and durability of OCA treatment. The apparent 
further decrease in ALP in the LTSE Safety Population was due to the transitioning of placebo subjects to 
OCA treatment, which further decreased mean ALP of the entire cohort. 
Sustained mean reductions in AST, ALT, GGT, and total bilirubin were observed at most LTSE timepoints. 
Changes in conjugated tended to be more variable; however, generally remained comparable to baseline. 
As part of the responses to the CHMP´s D120 LoQ, the Applicant provided an update of the results for 
study 747-201 LTSE.  
As of the data cut-off of 29 Jun 2015, 18 (64%) patients were ongoing and a total of 11 (39%) had up to 
5 years of exposure to OCA.  A post hoc analysis of Study 747 201 LTSE using the primary endpoint from 
Study 747-301 has been performed. (Figure 29)

females. 
•  747-202 LTSE 
Of the 165 subjects enrolled in the double-blind phase of the study, 78 subjects (21 of whom had received 
placebo) entered the open-label LTSE phase of the study. The most frequent reason for discontinuation 
was administrative reasons for 59 (76%) of subjects. Two subjects (3%) withdrew consent, 1 subject 
(1%) discontinued due to a major protocol violation, and 2 subjects (3%) withdrew for other reasons. A 
total of 14 subjects (18%) withdrew due to AEs, of these, 10 (13%) withdrawals were due to pruritus.  
Due to administrative reasons, subjects were off investigational product for up to 9 months before 
starting LTSE dosing. Further, the duration of time between the last dose in the double-blind phase and 
initiation of dosing in the LTSE was variable across subjects. Given these varied gaps in exposure, the 
changes in efficacy were assessed relative to both the double blind and LTSE Baselines to post Baseline, 
3, and 6 month visits, and study completion/ET LTSE visit.

For subjects previously randomized to OCA and who continued treatment with OCA in the LTSE, the 
percentage of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint at the end of the double-blind phase, 
i.e., Month 12 (51% for OCA titration and 56% for OCA 10 mg), was sustained over the subsequent 
12-month open-label period (52% for OCA titration and 44% for OCA 10 mg at LTSE Month 12). 
Following completion of the double blind phase, 193 subjects (89% of the double blind Intent-to-Treat 
Population) opted to continue into the LTSE and are summarized as the Safety Population. For subjects 
previously randomized to OCA and who continued treatment with OCA in the LTSE, the percentage of 
subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint at the end of the double-blind phase, i.e., Month 12 
(51% for OCA titration and 56% for OCA 10 mg),was sustained over the subsequent 12-month open-label 
period (52% for OCA titration and 44% for OCA 10 mg at LTSE Month 12).

As part of the responses to the CHMP´s D120 LoQ, the Applicant provided an update of the results for 
study 747-301 LTSE.  
As of the data cut-off of 29 Jun 2015, 173/193 (90%) patients were ongoing and 20 patients had 
cumulatively discontinued from the LTSE phase of the study, including 10 patients who discontinued 
between 31 Aug 2014 and 29 Jun 2015. 
The percentage of OCA-treated patients from LTSE 747-301 who achieved the primary composite 
endpoint is summarized in   Figure 33.   
Patients treated with placebo in the double-blind phase had a response in the LTSE phase after starting 
OCA that was a similar trend (slightly lower) to those observed for patients continuously treated with 
OCA.  It should be noted that placebo patients received a lower weighted average daily dose in the LTSE 
(35% of placebo patients received a weighted average daily dose ≤5 mg compared to 16% of OCA 
titration patients and 3% of OCA 10 mg patients).

Time (Months)
The mean (SD) absolute values at Baseline, LTSE Day 0, and LTSE Month 18 and the means (SD) change 
from baseline in ALP data over a 30-month treatment period (12 months double-blind and 18 months 
open-label) show reductions in ALP from Month 3 that were maintained throughout 2.5 years.   
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of obeticholic acid (OCA) in the treatment of PBC is mainly based on one single pivotal phase 
III study (747-301), two phase II studies (747-201 and 747-202) and their long-term safety extension 
(LTSE) studies (747-301-LTSE, 747-201-LTSE and 747-202-LTSE). Additional support is provided by 
study 747-205 (primary treatment phase). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose finding  
Dose selection for the phase III study was based on 2 phase II studies, 747-201 and 747-202. Both 
studies included patients with a proven or likely diagnosis of PBC, who were suboptimally controlled with 
UDCA or were intolerant to it. Both studies evaluated several doses of OCA, up to 50 mg, as monotherapy 
(study 747-201) or as add-on to UDCA (study 747-202) and the primary efficacy endpoint for both was 
the percent change (%) in serum ALP from Baseline to End of Study.  
There are some differences between the design of the pivotal study and the supportive phase II studies 
(747-201 and 747-202). These differences mainly consist of: liver entry criteria (ALP between 1.5 and 10 
ULN in the phase II ≥1.67 ULN in the pivotal), duration (phase II only 3 months), doses (higher doses 
were assessed in the phase II, as they were dose-ranging studies), presence of mandatory 
discontinuation criteria (no mandatory discontinuation criteria were implemented in the pivotal study, 
while in the phase II patients with a 2-fold increase in bilirubin or 3-fold in AST/ALT were required to 
discontinue) and primary endpoint (composite endpoint vs. %change in ALP from baseline until 3 months 
of treatment in the phase II studies). Overall, the doses tested demonstrated superiority over placebo. 
However, OCA doses >10 mg, did not show any additional benefits in terms of improvements in ALP or 
other liver biochemistry markers; on the contrary, higher doses were associated with higher incidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 95/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AEs, in particular pruritus. This effect was observed for both, monotherapy as well as add-on to UDCA, in 
comparison to placebo. 
The titration approach was not tested during the phase II studies. Based on the results of the phase II 
studies, the 5 mg and 10 mg doses were selected for the phase III program. Following the 
recommendations received from the CHMP PA (EMEA/H/SA/2016/1/2010/PA/III), the Applicant 
implemented a 3 arm design, which compared the titration regimen and the fixed 10 mg regimen with 
placebo (as add-on to UDCA).  
Pivotal study 747-301 
Study 747-301 was a randomized, multi-dose, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 
that was designed to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of OCA in subjects with PBC over a 12-month 
treatment period. Subjects with a probable or confirmed diagnosis of PBC who, prior to baseline, were 
either taking UDCA for at least 12 months (stable dose for ≥3 months) or were unable to tolerate UDCA 
(no UDCA for ≥3 months) were eligible for enrolment. To note, patients with total bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN, 
severe portal hypertension or hepatic failure were excluded from 747-301 study as from the two 
supportive studies. Thus, the enrolled population consisted of PBC patients with compensated disease.  
In the clinical setting no agreed definition of response to treatment currently exists and different criteria 
have been developed and are used at the clinic. Due to this fact, at the CHMP PA 
(EMEA/H/SA/2016/1/2010/PA/III) received by the Applicant, the inclusion criteria (as definition of 
insufficient response to UDCA) was considered acceptable. Regarding to the inclusion of patients unable 
to tolerate UDCA, the Applicant clarified that patients were considered “intolerant” based on the review of 
the patient´s medical history and the investigator´s clinical judgment for each patient 
This study evaluated a fixed dose of OCA (10 mg) and the titration approach over the 12-month treatment 
period (patients received 5 mg during the initial 6 months and could be titrated to 10 mg for the 
remainder of the 12-month treatment period in case of insufficient response, if no intolerance was 
present). From a clinical point of view, it would appear reasonable to assess the need to titrate the dose 
earlier than at 6 months, in order to reach an effective dose as soon as possible. Based on the few data 
available for the 3-month titration schedule (from the 51 placebo-treated patients who entered the LTSE 
of the pivotal study), the 3-month titration schedule did not seem to negatively impact tolerability. 
However, due to the limited data available at this time, the recommendation to increase to the 10mg dose 
after 6 months of treatment based on assessment of tolerability was considered appropriate by the CHMP 
for inclusion in the posology information of the SmPC.   
The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint, surrogate endpoint, defined as the percentage of 
subjects (OCA 10 mg vs. placebo) reaching an ALP <1.67x ULN and a ≥15% reduction in ALP and a total 
bilirubin ≤ULN at Month 12. Biochemical inclusion criteria evolved compared to those used in the Phase II 
studies. In particular, ALP and bilirubin cut-off values in the pivotal studies were based on data obtained 
from two PBC cohorts (Global and UK PBC Groups Studies). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Other markers of cholestasis, liver function, and hepatocellular injury were evaluated as secondary 
efficacy endpoints. No clinical outcome endpoints were included in the pivotal study. 
The choice of ALP as a surrogate variable is based on the 10 years-plus experience from UDCA. The 
adequacy of the primary composite endpoint, solely based on changes in biochemical parameters, was 
discussed at length during the CHMP PA (EMEA/H/SA/2016/1/2010/PA/III). It was considered acceptable 
subject to the obligation of the Applicant to collect as much data as possible regarding harder clinical 
endpoints such as histology, cirrhotic related events, fibrosis markers and elastography.  
Assessment report

Only limited non-invasive data (e.g. transient elastography, APRI score and ELF score) have been 
provided in this application and OCA treatment benefit remains mainly based on the improvement of 
several biochemical parameters, such as ALP and bilirubin levels. In order to support the clinical relevance 
of the observed results in the studied population available data derived from two large PBC cohorts 
(Global PBC Study and UK-PBC Cohorts) were presented. These cohorts included a large number of PBC 
patients and long-term follow-up. In general, results from these cohorts suggested an association 
between ALP (and bilirubin) levels and clinical outcomes, such as liver transplant or death. Further the 
applicant presented post-hoc analyses (performed by applying study 747-301 inclusion criteria and 
evaluating the primary endpoint in the cohort populations) suggesting that the association between ALP 
levels (at various thresholds defined by the clinical criteria) and clinical outcomes does not seem to be 
specific of UDCA treatment. 
Furthermore the Applicant developed in order to simulate safety and efficacy in a more advanced disease 
stages a clinical algorithm that included a clinical composite definition (based on biochemical criteria, 
non-invasive measures of fibrosis, biopsies, and/or medical history of decompensation), the Rotterdam 
criteria (biochemical criteria only), and presence of cirrhosis. From an efficacy point of view, results in a 
more “advanced population” (as defined by the clinical algorithm), were similar to those of the general 
study population. Although criteria seem reasonable interpretation of this un-validated algorithm remains 
limited and it is not known how accurately it identifies the target population.  
For the pivotal trial GCP inspections were conducted at three clinical investigator sites, one in Belgium and 
two in the USA (routine inspections) and also at the sponsor site and CRO site in the USA (triggered 
inspection) on dates between October 2015 and January 2016. The outcome of the inspections carried out 
was issued on 8 March 2016. 
The data obtained at the sites inspected were considered reliable to be accepted as support of the 
Marketing Authorisation Application submitted to the EMA for approval. 
Supportive phase II studies 
Study 747-205 
This open-label study assessed the effects of OCA on lipoprotein metabolism in patients with PBC. It 
evaluated only the 10 mg OCA dose (as add-on to UDCA, for 8 weeks), and the efficacy variables were 
related with different lipid metabolism parameters (HDLc concentration, total cholesterol, etc.). Key entry 
criteria were similar to those in the pivotal study.  
LTSE studies 
After the double-blind studies, patients were allowed to enroll in their open label extension studies. 
At entry (in studies 747-201-LTSE and 747-202-LTSE), patients from the phase II studies remained at the 
DB dose (placebo started OC at 10mg) and in subsequent visits, if clinically indicated, they could titrate 
every 8 weeks up to 50 mg. All patients from the phase III study started the LTSE (study 747-301-LTSE) 
at OCA 5mg (regardless of their previous dose) and at month 3 they could either remain at 5mg or titrate 
in 5mg increments to a maximum of 25mg in 3 months intervals.  
Efficacy variables were those from their respective double-blind periods. As in their respective 
double-blind periods, no clinical outcome variables were included in the LTSE studies.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal study 747-301 
A total of 217 patients were randomised (1:1:1), all but one of them received at least one dose of the 
study product (ITT population=216; 73 placebo, 70 titration OCA, 73 10 mg OCA). A total of 3, 7 and 9 
patients discontinued prematurely in the placebo, OCA titration and fixed 10 mg OCA groups, 
respectively. The main reasons for not completing the 12-month DB phase were AEs, most commonly 
pruritus.  
Most of the patients included were females (91%), White (94%) and European (67%). Median age was 55 
years (range 29-86), with the majority of patients under the age of 65 (81%). Most of the patients 
(n=200, 93%) were being treated with UDCA at baseline, with only a total of 16 patients (7%) receiving 
OCA in monotherapy during the study. 
Regarding to disease characteristics, most of the patients referred pruritus and a history of fatigue at 
baseline (59% each), with a slightly higher incidence in the placebo group. Laboratory values and other 
indicators of liver function and injury were similar across the treatment groups. In general, baseline and 
disease characteristics were balanced across the 3 treatment groups.  
Regarding to the composite primary endpoint results, at month 12, a higher percentage of patients in the 
fixed OCA 10 mg (n=34, 47%) achieved the primary endpoint compared to placebo (n=7, 10%), thus 
demonstrating superiority (p<0.0001). A higher percentage of patients (n=32, 46%) in the OCA titration 
group (key secondary endpoint) also achieved the composite endpoint, compared to placebo (p<0.0001). 
It is noted that responses are mainly driven by normalisation of ALP. As the vast majority of patients 
entered with normal/near normal Bilirubin values and remained normal throughout the study duration 
most information was generated in patients with compensated disease and in patients in early stages of 
clinical disease with little hepatic dysfunction. Bearing in mind the limited PK and clinical data available in 
patients with hepatic dysfunction and/or more advanced disease stage, confirmation will need to be given 
on the extent the results observed in this mild population can be extrapolated to the whole target 
population, including patients with moderate to severe liver disease, decompensated disease and 
transplanted patients. This will be addressed by both, study 747-302 and study 742-401 which are 
conditions to the marketing authorisation. 
Additional efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint (based on completer and EE populations) were 
supportive of the main results. 
Regarding to other secondary endpoints (mean absolute and percentage change from baseline to 6 and 
12 months in ALP, conjugated bilirubin, GGT, ALT, and AST), statistically significant differences were 
observed over placebo for both OCA treatment groups for most of the endpoints (with the exception of LS 
mean percentage change of bilirubin for OCA 10 mg vs. placebo, at 6 months).  
No statistically significant changes were observed for either OCA treatment group vs. placebo in terms of 
albumin, prothrombin time and INR, probably due to the fact the most patients had normal levels at 
baseline.  
Responder analyses were predefined in the protocol as the percentage of subjects with a decrease in ALP 
of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, and ≥40% from Baseline or ≤ULN. 
At both timepoints, 6 and 12 months, a higher percentage of patients in both OCA treatment groups 
achieved the ALP reduction, compared to placebo (p≤0.0001). At 12 months, approximately one third of 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 98/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in each OCA treatment group achieved an ALP reduction of >40%, compared with 1% in the 
placebo group. Only one patient in the OCA titration group and 5 patients in the OCA 10 mg group 
achieved ALP normal levels, vs. none in the placebo group (statically significant OCA 10 mg vs. placebo). 
In clinical practice, the normalization of ALP levels is considered a sign of good prognosis and it would add 
support to the correlation between ALP levels and long-term clinical outcomes. However, few patients 
achieved this after 12 months of treatment and it is difficult to make any conclusions.  
The percentage of subjects achieving the biochemical treatment response criteria (Paris I modified, Paris 
II, Mayo II, and Toronto II), were also higher in OCA treated patients than in the placebo group. The 
Rotterdam criteria, with defines responders as the % of patients reaching total bilirubin ≤ULN and 
albumin ≥LLN, did not reach statistical significance. 
Regarding the OCA effect on indirect inflammation markers, several biochemistry markers (IgM, CRP, and 
TNF-α) were evaluated to assess a potential effect on FXR agonism. After 12 months of OCA treatment, 
some differences in IgM, CRP and TNF-α are noted between the OCA groups in comparison with placebo 
(some of them statistically significant); however, their clinical relevance remains unknown. 
A total of 36 patients (52%) remained at 5mg dose and did not up titrate to 10mg. The main reason to 
remain at 5 mg dose was obtaining an efficacy response (n=32). In the subgroup of patients remaining at 
5mg, 67%, 50% and 53% achieved the primary endpoint at 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. Of those 
who up-titrated (0% had achieved endpoint at 6 months), 36% and 39% reached the primary endpoint at 
9 and 12 months, respectively. These results support the up-titration after 6 months of treatment. 
Monotherapy use in intolerant patients 
Fifty-one PBC patients with baseline ALP 1.67-times ULN or greater and/or total bilirubin greater than ULN 
were evaluated for a biochemical response to OCA as monotherapy (24 patients received OCA 10 mg once 
daily and 27 patients received placebo) in a pooled analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled 12 month study and from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month 
trial.  At Month 3, 9 (38%) OCA-treated patients achieved a response to the composite endpoint, 
compared to 1 (4%) placebo-treated patient.  The mean (95% CI) reduction in ALP in OCA-treated 
patients was 246 (165, 327) U/L compared to an increase of 17 (-7, 42) U/L in the placebo-treated 
patients. 
These data, although derived from a small sample size, does not suggest a lesser effect in this patient 
subset. Considering that patients intolerant to UDCA have an unmet medical need and are increased risk 
of developing adverse outcomes, OCA might represent a viable treatment option for them. 
Long term benefit 
Two of the LTSE were still on-going at the time of the initial submission. The Applicant provided an 
efficacy (and safety) for update of these studies (747-301-LTSE, 747-201-LTSE), with a data cut-off date 
of 29 Jun 2015. These updated results are consistent with the previously observed results and suggest 
that the effect seems to be maintained over time (up to a maximum of 30 months of treatment).  
Special populations 
The number of patients >65 years of age included in the phase II and pivotal studies is limited, 
particularly very elderly patients (≥75 years old). Although the results were statistically significant, the 
number of patients over the age of 65, and in particular ≥75, is very small, which is considered an 
important limitation since elderly patients represent a big proportion of the target population. The lack of 
data is appropriately outlined in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber and the confirmatory study 
747-302 will consider elderly patients as a relevant sub-population. The study is currently ongoing and as

of 03/08/2016, of the 90 patients currently enrolled, 23% patients were ≥65 years, which is comparable 
to those in the Global PBC Study Group Database. 
Few patients with renal impairment were included in the OCA phase II and III studies (most of them with 
mild renal impairment). Based on the post-hoc analyses performed by the Applicant, mild renal 
impairment does not seem to have a negative impact on efficacy. Due to the small number of patients 
with moderate renal impairment, separate efficacy data in this patient subset have not been provided. 
However, considering that obeticholic acid has minimal renal elimination with less than 3% of the dose 
recovered in urine and that based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal function did not have a 
meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of obeticholic acid the CHMP considered it sufficient to add this 
information to the SmPC. 
In addition, the Applicant tried to characterise the efficacy (and safety) of OCA in a more advanced PBC 
population by developing a clinical algorithm that would identify these patients. Results on the population 
identified by this algorithm seem to be similar to those of the study 747-301 population. However, it 
needs to be highlighted that this algorithm has not been validated. In addition, even assuming that the 
algorithm correctly selects patients with a more “advanced” disease stage, the overall number of patients 
continues to be too small to reach a sound conclusion. Results from both, study 747-302 and 747-401 on 
clinical outcomes are to be provided in order to be able to confirm with certainty on the effects of OCA in 
this more advanced population. The Applicant will provide annual updates to CHMP on study 
status/progress, interim results and immediate notification of unforeseen delays or issues with study 
conduct. In addition, any changes on the conduct of the study derived from the IA and/or DMC´s 
recommendations, which might result on the premature discontinuation, should be discussed with the 
CHMP.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The Open-label study (747-201 Phase 2) and a randomised Clinical Trial, (747-301, Phase 3) did not show 
difference in clinical disease symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue between OCA treatment vs. placebo 
(=standard of care (UDCA) + placebo). Efficacy has currently been substantiated using surrogate 
endpoints ALP and bilirubin (which for UDCA are indicators for disease progression). The effectiveness of 
OCA treatment to reduce clinically relevant disease symptoms (i.e. reducing disease burden for patient) 
is currently unknown. 
Furthermore the clinical follow-up is currently limited, i.e. max 5 years, in a limited number of patients. In 
the Phase 3 RCT only efficacy data up to 12 months is available, which is considered short in the context 
of a slowly progressive disease.  
Study 747-302 is imposed to address current uncertainties regarding the relationship between 
biochemical changes and liver clinical outcomes and long-term effects of the treatment 
The pivotal RCT (747-301) included mostly patients at an earlier disease stage. It is uncertain whether 
the effects on biochemical parameters and tolerability observed in this population can be extrapolated to 
patients with a more advanced disease. 
Study 747-401 is imposed to address current uncertainties regarding efficacy, safety and PK in patients 
with a more advanced disease state. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy shown in the pivotal trial is mainly based on biochemical changes as surrogate for clinical efficacy.

Available clinical data, although limited, together with the previous experience with UDCA, indicate that 
OCA treatment may translate into a clinically relevant benefit in the treatment of PBC after failure to 
UDCA. This is requested to be confirmed by means of the clinical outcome study (747-302) in the scope 
of this conditional marketing authorisation. In conjunction with study 747-401 the conditions are 
intended to provide long-term clinical outcome data including data in the more advanced liver disease 
population. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1507 subjects have been exposed to at least a single dose of OCA. This includes 169 subjects 
from 2 non-Intercept sponsored studies in other indications. 
The majority of subjects in the overall population had OCA exposure <3 months, consistent with the 
extensive Phase 1 program. Excluding 13 subjects received radiolabeled OCA in Study 747-113, of the 
remaining 1325 subjects, 290 had ≥6 months of exposure and 232 had ≥12 months of exposure, 
respectively. The mean (SD) number of days on OCA was 141.1 (279.60), the mean exposure was 0.42 
(0.797) years, and the mean daily OCA dose received was 22.7 mg (range of mean daily dose 10.8 mg to 
28.0 mg). The mean daily OCA dose was predominantly driven by the higher doses evaluated in the Phase 
2 programs (up to 50 mg).

Adverse events 
-  Pivotal study 747-301 
Across treatment groups, a similar number of subjects reported TEAEs (66 subjects [90%] from the 
placebo group reported 452 TEAEs, 65 subjects [93%] from the OCA titration group reported 471 TEAEs, 
and 69 subjects [95%] from the OCA 10 mg group reported a total of 467 TEAEs).  
The most frequently reported TEAE across all treatment groups was pruritus. Compared with placebo, the 
overall incidence of treatment-emergent pruritus was greater in the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups 
(28 subjects [38%], 39 subjects [56%], and 51 subjects [70%], respectively. The incidence of related 
TEAEs appeared to increase with increasing dose (52%, 60%, and 74% in placebo, OCA titration, and 
OCA 10 mg treatment groups, respectively).  
TEAEs that occurred with an incidence of ≥5% and were reported more frequently (at any percentage 
above placebo) in either OCA treatment group included rash, eczema, fatigue, peripheral oedema, 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, influenza, bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal discomfort, 
arthralgia, cough, oropharyngeal pain, procedural pain, fractures, palpitations, and hypothyroidism. 
There appeared to be a dose-related increase in the incidence of fatigue, arthralgia, and pruritus. Pyrexia 
was observed in 1 subject (1%) in the placebo group, no subjects in the OCA titration group, and 5 
subjects (7%) in the OCA 10 mg group.

Note: A TEAE is defined as any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following 
initiation of investigational product. a At each level of summation (overall, preferred term), subjects reporting more 
than one AE are counted only once. b As a post-hoc analysis, fractures are presented as an aggregate of all 
fractures/skeletal injuries within each treatment group. For the placebo group, 5 fractures (2 tibia fractures, 2 pubis 
fractures, and 1 upper limb fracture) were experienced by 3 subjects; in the OCA titration group, 2 fractures (1 wrist 
fracture and 1 ulna fracture) were experienced by 2 subjects; in the OCA 10 mg group, 7 fractures (2 clavicle fractures, 
2 radius fractures, 2 wrist fractures, and 1 skeletal injury) were experienced by 4 subjects 
The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate across all treatment groups. The overall incidence of severe 
events was 12% in the placebo group and 31% and 29% in the OCA titration and OCA 10 mg treatment 
groups, respectively. The imbalance in the incidence of severe TEAEs between the OCA and placebo 
groups was primarily attributable to the higher incidence of severe pruritus. 
The incidence of subjects reporting at least 1 related TEAE was highest in the OCA 10 mg group (52%, 
60%, and 74% in the placebo, OCA titration, and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). Across treatment 
groups, of the subjects with related TEAEs, the majority had a related pruritus TEAE and a 
dose-dependent relationship in the incidence of related pruritus TEAEs was observed. The number of 
subjects with related TEAEs of pruritus was 27 (37%) in the placebo group, 35 (50%) in the OCA titration 
group, and 48 (66%) in the OCA 10 mg group. 
Fatigue and nausea were the only other TEAEs considered to be related that occurred at an incidence 
≥5% in any treatment group. 
−  DB, placebo-controlled studies 
In the DB, placebo-controlled studies, 306 patients were exposed to OCA with 201 of them expose to 
doses ≤10 mg. In the OCA 10 mg group, almost all patients (n= 123, 93%) were exposed for at least 1 
month, with 49% of patients (64) exposed for at least 9 months. For OCA doses above 10mg, exposure 
past 1 month was limited due to the nature of the study designs (DB duration of 3 months) and the poor 
tolerance observed at  higher doses.  
The majority (>80%) of patients within each study completed the double-blind phase, with generally 
similar completion rates across the 3 studies. The most common reason for discontinuation was pruritus. 
Pooled data largely supports the safety profile observed in the pivotal studies. Some dose-relationship 
trends can be observed, especially in terms of pruritus, which showed the highest incidence in the 
treatment groups that initiated treatment at 50 mg OCA (80%- 94%).  
−  AESIs 
The Applicant selected AESIs as those TEAEs frequently reported and assessed as OCA-related (e.g. 
pruritus), those related to dose-limiting toxicities (e.g. hepatic disorders), lab changes (e.g. lipids, liver 
enzymes) or other TEAs generally associated with adverse outcomes (e.g. CV AEs). A comparison was 
made between OCA and placebo groups.  
Pruritus 
Pruritus is a common symptom associated with PBC and also is an OCA-induced, dose-related TEAE. This 
is an AE that could impact patient’s quality of life and, in some hard to control cases, lead to an early LT 
due to being treatment-resistant.  
In the pivotal study, over half of the patients on any of the treatment groups reported on-going pruritus 
at baseline (64%, 53% and 60% in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10mg groups, respectively). 
TEAEs of pruritus, defined as new on-set or increasing intensity pruritus, were more frequently reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 104/129 
 
 
 
 
 
in OCA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (38%, 56% and 70%, in the placebo, OCA 
titration and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). Most of them required an intervention for pruritus (50%, 
62% and 59% in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). Discontinuations due 
to pruritus occurred in approximately 10% of patients (n=8, 1 in the OCA titration group, 7 in the fixed 
OCA 10 mg group). In terms of severity, more OCA-treated patients reported a maximum severity of 
moderate/severe events, when compared with placebo treated patients (17%, 40%, and 49%, in the 
placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). 
Based on the titration subgroups, the percentage of patients that experienced pruritus during the 2nd 
6-month period was similar between those who remained at 5mg and those that up-titrated to 10mg 
(58% vs. 55%). The incidence of pruritus for both titration subgroups was lower during this later period 
(both 33%), compared with the initial 6 months. Severity (in terms of severe pruritus event days) was 
lower in those patients that up-titrated than during the initial 6-month period of those from the OCA 10mg 
group (2.31 days vs. 41.05 days). 
Separate data on new on-set or increasing intensity pruritus was presented as response to the D120 LoQ.

frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study drug. Patients reporting more than one TEAE of pruritus 
are counted only once using the highest severity.  
Patient reported outcomes, such as pruritus VAS or the 5-D pruritus questionnaire, seemed to indicate 
that patient’s perception of pruritus severity improved with continued treatment (VAS), and the analysis 
of the 5-D pruritus questionnaire  (by ANCOVA) did not show any significant differences across the 
different treatment arms at the end of the 12-month double-blind treatment period. 
In the DB, placebo-controlled studies, a clear dose-relationship trend can be observed for pruritus, which 
showed the highest incidence in the treatment groups that initiated treatment at 50 mg OCA (80%- 
94%).

Hepatic-related effects 
The incidence of TEAEs in this SOC group was low in general. However, they seem to be dose-related, with 
more OCA-treated patients reporting them, compared to the placebo group.  
Table 31: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Effects of Special Interest-Hepatic Disorders; 
Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Studies in Subjects with PBC (All Treated Subjects, N = 
440) 
Lipid-related effects and Cardiovascular TEAE 
Lipid disorders are commonly seen in patients with PBC. Any relevant changes can be considered as 
relevant due to the potential long-term implications in CV safety. OCA treatment has been associated with 
reductions in HLD-c levels and increases in LDL-c.  
In 60 OCA-treated subjects, HDLc levels decreased below the LLN at least on 1 day after the first dose of 
investigational product. In 89 OCA-treated subjects, LDLc levels were >LLN for at least 1 post- day and 
were increased from Baseline by >10 mg/dL for 2 consecutive visits. Ofthese, altogether 8 OCA-treated 
subjects experienced a qualifying change in HDLc and/or LDLc levels and also developed a cardiovascular 
event with 1 OCA-treated subject in Study 747-301 (OCA titration) and 1 OCA-treated subject in Study 
747-202 (OCA 50 mg) experiencing an SAE. Thus, changes in post-day 1 HDLc or LDLc did not reveal a 
clear pattern with regards to the incidence of cardiovascular disorders by dose or between OCA-treated 
subjects and placebo-treated subjects. There was no difference in the incidence of lipid disorders between 
OCA and placebo groups.  
Dyslipidemia Disorders occurred with an incidence of approximately 2% in all OCA dose groups relative to 
1% with placebo treatment. The minimum time to the first onset was sooner in the OCA-treated subjects 
compared with placebo-treated subjects (80 days vs. 188 days). All events of lipid disorders were mild or 
moderate in severity. One event of hypercholesterolemia (study 747-202, OCA 25 mg) and 2 events of 
hyperlipidemia (study 747-301, OCA 10 mg) were considered to be possible related to investigational 
product. Neither subject experienced a cardiovascular event. 
Further details were provided as part of the D120 responses (see below).

History of Dyslipidemia 
Lower limit of normal for HDL-C 1.04 mmol/L; Upper limit of normal for LDL-C 2.59 mmol/L. 
The distribution of patients with a history of cardiovascular conditions at the start of treatment was 
comparable across treatment groups (40%, 34%, and 42% for placebo, OCA titration, and OCA 10 mg, 
respectively) and most of the CV events occurred in patients with pre-existing medical conditions (Table 
33) and were not associated with vital sign or ECG abnormalities.

The Framingham Risk was used to assess Study 747-301 patients’ 10 year risk for developing CV disease 
(Figure 35).  Since smoking status was not collected in the study, a worst case scenario was assumed with 
all patients assumed to be smokers.  The results of this analysis indicated that the vast majority of 
patients had a <10% risk for developing a CV event when assessed at baseline and after 12 months of 
treatment demonstrating a stable CV risk profile with OCA treatment.

The long-term cardiovascular implications of changes in serum lipoproteins continue to be investigated in 
the ongoing LTSE studies and the long-term PBC outcomes study (747-302). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Across all studies conducted with OCA, a total of 4 treatment-emergent deaths were reported. In addition 
to two deaths occurred in patients with PBC which were considered not related to OCA, 2 female subjects 
with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) experienced an SAE that was fatal. One of these deaths was 
considered by the investigator as possibly related to OCA (FLINT). 
Serious Adverse Events 
In total, 31 subjects experienced SAEs in the clinical pharmacology and double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies. 
One OCA-treated subject in the clinical pharmacology studies experienced an SAE after the subject had 
been discontinued from the study. This was a male subject (OCA 25 mg, 747-110) without a prior history 
of liver disease that was discontinued from the study due to a TEAE of abdominal pain. Eight days after 
discontinuation, the subject experienced 2 SAEs (Cholecystitis acute and Cholelithiasis). The SAEs were 
assessed as definitely related to treatment by the Investigator. 
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in subjects with PBC, 25 subjects [8%] treated with OCA 
experienced 33 SAEs, compared with 5 subjects (4%) treated with placebo who experienced 10 SAEs. The 
incidence of SAEs did not appear to be dose-related. The majority of subjects (n = 21) experienced SAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 108/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that were assessed as unlikely or not related to treatment and the majority of subjects who experienced 
an SAE during the double-blind phase did not discontinue treatment or discontinue from the study.  
Of SAEs that occurred in OCA-treated subjects, 4 events were considered related to OCA therapy, all of 
which occurred at the OCA 50 mg dose (Study 747-202) and within 1 month of initiating treatment. Two 
of these SAEs were in the SOC of “Hepatobiliary Disorders” (jaundice, biliary cirrhosis primary [PBC 
flare]), 1 in the SOC of Gastrointestinal Disorders (gastrointestinal hemorrhage), and 1 in the SOC of 
“General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions” (chest pain). 
With the exception of varicose vein and osteoarthritis, which were each experienced by 2 OCA-treated 
subjects (<1%), and dyspnea, which was experienced by 2 placebo-treated subjects (<1%), no SAEs 
were experienced by more than 1 subject. Overall, each SAE was reported by <1% of subjects indicating 
no particular pattern or trend for SAEs were seen with OCA treatment. Most SAEs were considered to be 
recovered, resolved. 
More subjects treated with OCA compared with placebo had SAEs in the SOCs of “Gastrointestinal 
Disorders”, “Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications”, “Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue 
Disorders”, and “Infections and Infestations”.  
Within the SOC of Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications, 3 subjects in (4%) the OCA 10 mg 
group had fracture-related SAEs compared with 1 subject in the placebo group. Each fracture-related SAE 
was experienced by a single subject and none were considered related to treatment. In a population of 
mostly women with PBC, these events were not unexpected and a review of the subjects’ medical 
histories indicated that most subjects had a relevant medical history. 
The incidence of SAEs in the OCA titration group was higher compared with other doses and compared 
with placebo. Within this treatment group, there was a clustering of SAEs in the SOC of ‘Gastrointestinal 
Disorders” (4 subjects [6%]). Overall, SAEs that were experienced by OCA-titration-treated subjects 
were predominantly associated with their history of PBC and none were considered related to 
investigational product. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Transient changes in individual subject hematology analytes were experienced across the placebo and 
OCA-treatment groups. No relevant changes for any hematology parameter were observed in any 
treatment group. 
Serum Chemistry 
No clinically meaningful differences in absolute mean changes in serum chemistry parameters from 
Baseline to each assessed timepoint were observed across treatment groups, with the exception of 
analytes expected to be affected by OCA (i.e., markers of improvement in intrahepatic cholestasis and 
hepatocellular injury, synthetic liver function, and changes in lipoprotein metabolism).  
Safety in special populations 
The majority of subjects treated with OCA from the double-blind studies (747-201, 747-202, and 747-301 
[n=306] were <60 years old (190 [62%]): 97 (32%) age 60-69, 16 (5%) age 70-79, and three ≥80 
(<1%).Subjects in the double-blind phases of PBC studies were pooled and analysed by their “age at time 
of enrolment” (<65 years and ≥65 years). Of 306 subjects treated with OCA, 252 were <65 years of age 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 109/129 
 
 
 
 
 
and 54 were ≥65 years of age. The age distribution in the placebo group was similar to that of 
OCA-treated subjects (112 subjects <65 years of age and 22 were ≥65 years of age).  
Although, the disparity in the overall number of subjects between the age groups precludes major 
conclusions, the incidence of TEAEs in both subgroups was similar (95% of OCA-treated subjects 
experienced a TEAE in the <65 years age group versus 89% in the ≥ 65 years group), which was also 
similar to the TEAE incidence in placebo-treated subjects in both age groups (88% and 91%, 
respectively). Thus, there did not appear to be an age-related increase in the incidence of TEAEs in 
general and there was no age-related increase in the incidence of common TEAEs (pruritus, 
nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and headache). In addition, there were no age-related differences by dose. 
There appeared to be slightly more OCA-treated subjects ≥65 years of age with a cardiovascular disorder 
TEAE compared with subjects <65 years of age (7% and 3%, respectively); this pattern was also 
observed in placebo-treated subjects (9% and 3%, respectively) suggesting this is an age-related 
observation as opposed to treatment-related. All other AESIs (pruritus, hepatic disorders, and 
dyslipidemia) were more frequently observed in subjects <65 years of age compared with subjects ≥65 
years of age although, the small number ≥65 years subjects precludes definitive conclusions  
The incidence of treatment emergent SAEs was similar overall in OCA-treated subjects in both age 
groups. There was no difference in the types of SAEs occurring in either age group. 
Paediatric Population 
PBC has only been reported extremely rarely in paediatric patients. Therefore, no clinical studies were 
conducted in paediatric subjects with PBC. 
Hepatic Impairment 
The Sponsor did not conduct a study in patients with decompensated PBC. However, data evaluating 
safety of a single dose of OCA 10 mg in subjects with a spectrum of hepatic impairment (747-103) due to 
other underlying liver diseases and multiple day dosing (6 to 12 days) at doses of OCA 10 mg and OCA 25 
mg in subjects with alcoholic cirrhotic portal hypertension (747-204) are available.  
The entirety of data from these studies in combination with information obtained from further modelling 
the data suggest that although systemic concentrations of OCA increase with increasing severity of 
hepatic impairment, hepatic concentrations are unlikely substantially different and the safety profile of 
OCA in subjects with Mild/Moderate/Severe cirrhosis was similar to that observed in the compensated 
PBC subjects studied. 
Based on both Studies 747-103 and 747-204, increased systemic exposure to OCA and its conjugates, in 
conjunction with increased exposure to endogenous bile acids with increasing severity of cirrhosis, was 
not associated with an apparent change in the safety profile of OCA as assessed by the incidence and 
severity of TEAEs or by changes in clinical laboratory tests. No SAEs or study discontinuations were 
observed in Study 747-103. 
The AE profile of hepatically-impaired subjects in Study 747-204 was similar to that observed in 
double-blind, placebo-controlled subjects with PBC. Pruritus, headache, and nausea were the most 
commonly observed TEAEs in Study 747-204 and were also common TEAEs (occurring with an incidence 
of ≥5%) in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in subjects with PBC. Most events were considered to 
be of mild severity and aside for pruritus, only nausea was considered to be related in more than 1 
subject. No subjects treated with OCA 10 mg reported an SAE or a study discontinuation due to a TEAE; 
1 subject treated with OCA 25 mg reported an SAE (lacunar infarction) 3 days after initiating treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 110/129 
 
 
 
 
 
and was discontinued from the study. The SAE was assessed as unlikely related to OCA. Overall, the 
severity of TEAEs and incidence of SAEs did not appear to increase in subjects with hepatic impairment.  
Renal impairment  
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. After administration of 
radiolabelled OCA in healthy volunteers, less than 3% of the dose was eliminated in urine suggesting 
minimal renal elimination. Renal elimination of total OCA (OCA, glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA) was less than 
1% in subjects with hepatic impairment.  
Based on these data, it is highly unlikely that renal impairment will affect the PK or safety profile of OCA 
and therefore no dose adjustment of OCA is required for renal impairment (747-113). 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
No clinical studies in pregnant or lactating women have been conducted. One pregnancy occurred during 
the 12-month, double-blind phase of Study 747-301. The subject was not taking any contraception at the 
time of the pregnancy, which was in the assessment of the Sponsor a major protocol violation.  
Studies of reproductive and developmental toxicology in animals revealed no untoward effects of OCA. 
Based on the lack of specific effects in the battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, and 
the large safety margin at the NOAEL dose for developmental toxicity in rat and rabbit, OCA would not be 
expected to cause foetal harm when administered during conception of pregnancy. Section 4.6 of the 
SmPC recommends as a precautionary measure to avoid use of obeticholic acid during pregnancy. 
No specific nonclinical or clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the presence of OCA or conjugates in 
breast milk. The tauro-conjugate of OCA was observed, at low exposures, in rat pups nursing from dams 
dosed with OCA. The lack of effects in offspring from pre-/postnatal studies at up to 21-fold anticipated 
human exposure suggests that there are no specific concerns for lactation or breastfeeding of infants. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC recommends that a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from obeticholic acid therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Five Phase 1 DDI studies involving repeated oral administrations of 10 mg and 25 mg OCA were 
performed to evaluate the potential of OCA at steady state concentrations to act as an inhibitor, inducer 
or substrate of certain metabolizing enzymes and transporters (midazolam (CYP3A4), caffeine (CYP1A2), 
warfarin (CYP2C9), rosuvastatin (BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3), dextromethorphan (CYPD6), omeprazole 
(CYP2C19), and digoxin(P-gp). Based on the results of these studies, no inhibition to weak inhibition 
involving OCA and CYPs and transporters were observed and were not expected to cause clinically 
meaningful interactions, particularly in relation to safety. 
However, the weak suppression of CYP1A2 (primarily at the 25 mg dose level) may produce clinically 
relevant increases in exposure for drugs that are metabolized by this CYP and have a narrow therapeutic 
window. This is outlined in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber. 
Across the DDI studies, no new safety signals were identified. There were no deaths or other significant 
TEAEs reported. One subject in Study 747-110 discontinued due to a TEAE (abdominal pain) and 
experienced 2 SAEs (cholecystitis acute and cholelithiasis) after discontinuation from the study. No safety 
signals suggesting an overexposure to OCA were observed during concomitant administration of OCA and 
omeprazole, supporting that gastric pH is not an important determinant in OCA absorption.

Intrinsic Factors 
TEAE data from 306 PBC subjects treated with OCA and 134 (total of 440 PBC subjects) subjects treated 
with placebo in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were evaluated for possible subgroup 
differences. 
Age at PBC Diagnosis 
No substantial differences in the incidence of pruritus, fatigue, SAEs, CV events by age at PBC diagnosis 
were readily obvious. The duration of treatment in all 3 double-blind placebo controlled studies is 
considered too short and the number of subjects exposed too small to derive meaningful conclusions 
regarding the incidence of some of the events, e.g. cardiovascular events. Long term safety will be 
followed up as missing information as outlined in the risk management plan. 
Gender 
Male gender has been associated with a worse clinical prognosis for PBC. Overall very few male patients 
were included to allow a sound conclusion. In general, no clear indications of sex-related differences in the 
safety profile of OCA were observed. 
BMI 
There incidence of TEAEs by BMI subgroup was assessed and there was no difference in the overall 
incidence of TEAEs (94% for both BMI subgroups). There did not appear to be a dose-related effect on the 
incidence of TEAEs by BMI subgroup. In addition, there was no marked difference in the most commonly 
reported TEAEs when analyzed by BMI subgroup.  
Race 
The majority of subjects who participated in the double-blind studies were White subjects versus 
non-White subjects (296 subjects versus 10 subjects); 95% and 80% of subjects, respectively, 
experienced a TEAE. Due to the small number of Non-White subjects, conclusive interpretations of AEs by 
race cannot be made. 
Disease Severity 
Although no differences in safety profile were observed according to baseline bilirubin subgroups (≤ ULN 
vs.>ULN), bearing in mind the mild population included, more comprehensive data on the  use in patients 
with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C) will  be generated post authorisation. 
Extrinsic factors 
Region 
In the double-blind period, the overall incidence of TEAEs by treatment group was similar between North 
America and Europe, with 95% and 93% of OCA-treated subjects experiencing a TEAE and comparable 
rates observed in the respective placebo groups. With the exception of nasopharyngitis, no regional 
differences in the incidence of common TEAEs in OCA-treated subjects were observed.  
Incidence rates of cardiovascular disorders and dyslipidaemia disorders were comparable between 
regions. Hepatic disorders appeared to occur with slightly greater frequency with OCA treatment in North 
America (6%) compared to Europe (3%). The slightly higher event rate in North America was driven by 
events in the OCA 50 mg, which more North American (n = 40) subjects were exposed compared to 
Europe (n = 17). The incidence of treatment emergent SAEs did not show a regional difference or a 
distinct pattern of SAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 112/129 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, there was no significant regional variation in the safety profile of OCA. Hepatic disorders 
may have occurred with slightly greater incidence in North American subjects treated with OCA, but this 
was likely due to differential exposure to OCA 50 mg. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Most subjects in the double-blind, placebo-controlled PBC studies completed their study. A total of 47 
subjects (15%) treated with OCA withdrew from the study due to a TEAE while 4 subjects (3%) treated 
with placebo withdrew due to a TEAE. 
Most TEAEs leading to discontinuation for OCA-treated subjects were in the SOC of “Skin and 
Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders” (36 subjects [12%]); 34 (11%) of these had a TEAE of pruritus that 
resulted in study discontinuation with most (n = 21) treated with OCA >10 mg. 
In subjects treated with OCA 10 mg, the most frequently reported TEAE leading to study discontinuation 
was pruritus (n = 12). Of the 12 subjects with TEAEs of pruritus that resulted in study discontinuation, 7 
occurred in Study 747-301 in the OCA 10 mg group. In this group, TEAEs of pruritus leading to 
discontinuation generally resolved within 2 months. In the OCA titration group, 1 subject withdrew due to 
a TEAE of pruritus after 221 days. The substantially lower incidence of subject discontinuations in the OCA 
titration group demonstrates the benefit of a titration regimen.  
Other events that resulted in study discontinuation and were experienced by more than 1 OCA-treated 
subject were nausea (3 subjects [<1%]), ALT increased (2 subjects [<1%]), and oedema peripheral (2 
subjects [<1%]). The highest rate of discontinuation was experienced by subjects treated with the 50 mg 
dose. Other than pruritus, no patterns were identified with respect to TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission of the dossier the product was not authorised in any country 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
- 
Pivotal study 747-301 
Of the 217 randomised patients, 216 received at least one dose of the study treatments and 198 of them 
completed the 12-month DB period (70, 64 and 64 patients in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10 mg 
groups, respectively). The main reason for discontinuation was AE (n=15), followed by consent 
withdrawal (n=4).  
Over 90% of patients on any of the treatment groups experienced at least one treatment emergent AE 
(TEAE), with over half of the TEAEs considered as treatment-related (52% in placebo, 60% in OCA 
titration group and 74% in the OCA 10 mg).  
The most frequent TEAE across all treatment groups was pruritus, which is a symptom also known to be 
associated with PBC. Over half of OCA-treated patients experienced pruritus (56% and 68% in the OCA 
titration and OCA10mg groups, respectively), compared to 38% of the placebo-treated patients. Pruritus 
has been identified by the Applicant as an AE of Special Interest (AESI) and is further discussed at the end 
of this section.  
Other TEAEs more frequently reported in OCA-treated patients than in placebo were fatigue, 
nasopharingitis, arthralgia and hypothyroidism. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 113/129 
 
 
 
 
 
It is noted that the frequencies of most GI disorders were similar for placebo and either OCA treatment 
group with the exception of dyspepsia, which was more frequently reported in placebo patients (8 vs. 4 
[all in OCA titration group]). 
Regarding lab abnormalities, no relevant haematological parameter changes were observed. For serum 
chemistry parameters, no relevant differences were observed across groups, with the exception of those 
parameters expected to be affected by OCA treatment.  
In terms of severity, the majority of events were mild-moderate with a numerically more OCA patients 
reporting moderate to severe TEAEs.  
AESIs 
The Applicant selected AESIs as those TEAEs frequently reported and assessed as OCA-related (e.g. 
pruritus), those related to dose-limiting toxicities (e.g. hepatic disorders), lab changes (e.g. lipids, liver 
enzymes) or other TEAs generally associated with adverse outcomes (e.g. CV AEs). A comparison was 
made between OCA and placebo groups.  
Pruritus 
Pruritus is a common symptom associated with PBC and also is an OCA-induced, dose-related TEAE. This 
is an AE that could impact patient’s quality of life and, in some hard to control cases, lead to an early LT 
due to being treatment-resistant.  
Over half of the patients on any of the treatment groups reported on-going pruritus at baseline (64%, 
53% and 60% in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). TEAEs of pruritus, 
defined as new on-set or increasing intensity pruritus, were more frequently reported in OCA-treated 
patients than in placebo-treated patients (38%, 56% and 70%, in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10 
mg groups, respectively). Most of them required an intervention for pruritus (50%, 62% and 59% in the 
placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10mg groups, respectively).  
Pruritus was the main reason for discontinuation in a total of 8 patients, 1 in the OCA titration group and 
7 in the OCA 10 mg. Discontinuations due to pruritus occurred in approximately 10% of patients.  
Regarding to time to onset, pruritus TEAEs occurred sooner in OCA 10 mg patients (mean time 
approximately 7 weeks), followed by OCA titration group patients (by 2 months) and placebo patients 
(within 3 months of the start of the study). 
The incidence of pruritus seemed to be comparable between patients with on-going pruritus and those 
with new-onset pruritus. These AEs were mostly manageable with standard measures. Overall, these AEs 
were tolerated, as suggested by the low numbers of discontinuations due to pruritus. 
In terms of severity, more OCA-treated patients reported a maximum severity of moderate/severe 
events, when compared with placebo treated patients (17%, 40%, and 49%, in the placebo, OCA titration 
and OCA 10 mg groups, respectively). Data regarding pruritus event days per subject-year (day 0 to 
month 12) showed a larger number of moderate-severe pruritus event days in OCA-treated patients, 
compared with placebo-treated patients, in which the majority of event days were mild.  
When the occurrence of these TEAEs is broken down in two 6-month periods, some differences can be 
seen between the two OCA treatment groups. The number of severe pruritus event days per subject-year 
in OCA 10 mg was larger during the first 6 months and then decreased (from 41.05 to 21.02, 
respectively), while there was a slight increase in the number of severe pruritus event days per 
subject-year in OCA titration patients during the second 6-month period (from 7.99 to 10.17, 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 114/129 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively), but remained at a lower frequency than that observed for OCA10mg patients during the 
first 6-month period.  
Based on the titration subgroups, the percentage of patients that experienced pruritus during the 2nd 
6-month period was similar between those who remained at 5mg and those that up-titrated to 10mg 
(58% vs. 55%). The incidence of pruritus for both titration subgroups was lower during this later period 
(both 33%), compared with the initial 6 months. Severity (in terms of severe pruritus event days) was 
lower in those patients that up-titrated than during the initial 6-month period of those from the OCA 10mg 
group (2.31 days vs. 41.05 days). 
Patient reported outcomes, such as pruritus VAS or the 5-D pruritus questionnaire, seemed to indicate 
that patient’s perception of pruritus severity improved with continued treatment (VAS), and the analysis 
of the 5-D pruritus questionnaire  (by ANCOVA) did not show any significant differences across the 
different treatment arms at the end of the 12-month double-blind treatment period. 
The SmPC lists pruritus as a very common adverse reaction and provides guidance on dose adjustment / 
treatment discontinuation for the management of pruritus. 
Hepatic-related effects 
The incidence of TEAEs in this group was low in general in the pivotal study. However, they seem to be 
dose-related, with more OCA-treated patients reporting them, compared to the placebo group.  
Although increases in liver enzymes were not common in this study, most of the hepatic-related events 
reported (such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, oesophageal varices, and upper GI haemorrhage) 
seem to be disease progression-related, as the majority of them are frequent complications seen in later 
stages of the disease. In spite of the low numbers, this is an important and somewhat unexpected matter 
of concern, bearing in mind the mild population included in this study. The Applicant clarified that all 
Hepatic AEs occurred in patients with more advanced liver disease (as identified by the Applicant´s 
algorithm). These events will need to be further characterised in the currently on-going “confirmatory” 
study and/or by additional post-marketing data monitoring. The SmPC notes the occurrence of 
liver-related adverse reactions and provides guidance to HCPs on monitoring for possible liver injury. 
Lipid-related effects and Cardiovascular TEAE 
Lipid disorders are commonly seen in patients with PBC. Any relevant changes can be considered as 
relevant, due to the potential long-term implications in CV safety. OCA treatment has been associated 
with reductions in HLD-c levels and increases in LDL-c. These events mainly occurred in patients with 
pre-existing lipid disorders. Assessment of atherosclerotic CV-related events, evaluation of risk factors 
and measures taken to minimize risk will be reported in the 6 monthly PSURs. The long-term 
cardiovascular implications of changes in serum lipoproteins continue to be investigated in the ongoing 
LTSE studies and the long-term PBC outcomes study (747-302). 
In general, the frequency of CV TEAEs was low and most of them were mild or moderate in severity. A 
total of 4 SAEs were reported by 2 patients: 1 SAE of chest pain and 1 SAE of sick sinus syndrome in one 
subject; two SAEs of congestive heart failure in another subject (one of them fatal). 
SAEs and deaths 
The overall number of SAEs was in general low, with higher number of patients reporting them in the OCA 
treatment groups (4%, 16% and 11% in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA 10mg groups, respectively). 
A dose-dependent relationship is not readily obvious for SAEs, probably due to the small numbers.  
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 115/129 
 
 
 
 
 
One death, due to worsening congestive heart failure, was reported in the pivotal trial, a male with 
various CV co-morbidities. The event was assessed by investigators as “unlikely related”. This further 
stresses the relevance of characterising the effect of OCA on the lipid profile and in the elderly. 
With regards to hepatic-related SAEs, a total of 3 patients (1 (1%) in placebo, 2 (3%) in the OCA titration 
group), reported a total of 8 SAEs. Most of these SAEs were consistent with potential disease progression 
events (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy). Further insight on long term safety and efficacy in PBC patients in 
more advanced disease stages and in the elderly will be provided within studies 747-302 and – 402 which 
are conditions to the marketing authorisation. 
Discontinuations due to AEs  
Overall, the incidence of treatment discontinuation was low, suggesting that OCA treatment is reasonably 
tolerated. The main reason for discontinuation was due to AEs, reported by a total of 15 patients. Of the 
patients in the OCA titration groups discontinuing due to AEs, none of them had up-titrated to 10mg. The 
most common TEAE leading to discontinuation was pruritus, reported in 8 patients, 1 patient in the OCA 
titration and 7 in the OCA 10mg group and none in the placebo group. Most of these pruritus TEAEs were 
severe in intensity.  
The remaining TEAEs (rash, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, contusion, and 
headache) occurred in one patient each, with two patients reporting a SAE (one fatal cardiac failure, one 
interstitial lung disease) that lead to discontinuation. 
Pooled data from the DB, placebo-controlled and LTSE studies. 
In the overall clinical program, a total of 1325 subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose of OCA, among 
which 306 were participating in double-blind (DB) studies. Of these, 201 were exposed to doses ≤10 mg. 
In the OCA10mg group, almost all patients (n= 123, 93%) were exposed for at least 1 month, with 49% 
of patients (64) exposed for at least 9 months. For OCA doses above 10mg, exposure past 1 month was 
limited due to the nature of the study designs (DB duration of 3 months) and the poor tolerance observed 
at higher doses.  
The majority (>80%) of patients within each study completed the double-blind phase, with generally 
similar completion rates across the 3 studies. The most common reason for discontinuation was pruritus. 
Pooled data largely supports the safety profile observed in the pivotal study. In general, OCA safety 
profile reported in the DB studies was comparable to that of the OL LTSE studies. Some dose-relationship 
trends can be observed, especially in terms of pruritus, which showed the highest incidence in the 
treatment groups that initiated treatment at 50 mg OCA (80%- 94%).  
Patients on OCA experienced TEAEs more frequently than those on PBO (94% vs. 89%, p=0.05). 
Moreover, among TEAEs, those presented by OCA patients were more often severe than those presented 
by PBO (29% vs. 13%, p<0.01), and more frequently related to investigational product (77% vs. 53%, 
p<0.01). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Regarding hepatic-related TEAEs potentially, they were numerically more frequent at the 50mg dose, 
suggesting a dose-relationship. This includes those TEAEs related to hepatic decompensation. All patients 
who experienced liver adverse events had demonstrated signs and symptoms of advanced disease prior 
to initiating treatment with OCA. Hepatic-related TEAEs typically occurred between the first 1 to 3 months 
of treatment. Therefore the prescriber is advised in 4.4 of the SmPC to monitor patients during treatment 
for elevations in liver biochemical tests and for the development of liver-related adverse reactions and 
dose adjustments were included in the SmPC for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe 
(Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (see also discussion on pharmacology). 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 116/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding SAEs during the double-blind phase studies, these were more frequent in OCA-treated patients 
(25 OCA-treated patients [8%] vs. 5 placebo-treated patients [4%]). Four of the OCA 
treatment-emergent SAEs (all occurred in the OCA 50 mg dose) were considered to be related to OCA. 
Two of the SAEs were hepatic (jaundice and PBC flare) and 1 GI (GI hemorrhage). This finding further 
stresses the relevance of characterising the effect of OCA on liver function within the defined conditions to 
the marketing authorisation, especially considering that the population included was at an early stage of 
the disease and that limited data is available on patients with a more advanced disease stage and/or liver 
impairment. 
Special populations 
Age 
• 
Paediatric patients 
A waiver was granted for all subsets of the paediatric PBC population from birth to less than 18 years of 
age, since PBC does not occur in the specified paediatric subsets.  
• 
Elderly patients  
Although there seems to be no relevant age-related differences in terms of TEAE incidence, the data in 
elderly and very elderly patients are limited. This is outlined in the SmPC.  Further insight on long term 
safety and efficacy in PBC patients in more advanced disease stages and in the elderly will be provided 
within studies 747-302 and – 402 which are conditions to the marketing authorisation.  
Liver impairment 
Clinical studies in PBC patients with decompensated liver disease have not been conducted. Available are 
data from two clinical studies in subjects with various degrees of liver impairment due to other liver 
diseases: study 747-103, multiple-day dosing of OCA 10mg (duration 6-12 days); study 747-204, 
multiple day dosing of OCA 25 mg in patients with alcoholic cirrhotic portal hypertension. Data available 
from patients with moderate or severe liver impairment is very limited and particularly study 747- 402 will 
further characterize this profile. 
Data from these studies and additional PK modelling indicate that OCA exposure increases with increasing 
severity of the liver impairment. In patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment there was an 
increase in systemic exposure of OCA of approximately 4- fold (Cmax and AUC; LS mean) and 
approximately 10 to17-fold (Cmax and AUC; LS mean); respectively. Similar increased systemic 
exposure was observed in the study of subjects taking 10 mg or 25 mg of OCA in patients with alcoholic 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension (moderate to severe hepatic impairment) relative to healthy subjects. 
While higher plasma exposures are expected to occur in patients with hepatic impairment, only small 
increases in liver exposure are predicted. Data from the clinical hepatic impairment study and PK 
simulations performed by the Applicant show that total OCA exposure in the liver increased 1.1-fold, 
1.5-fold and 1.7-fold for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to 
exposures in patients with normal hepatic function. It is agreed that a 2-fold increase in liver exposure, as 
predicted for the recommended 5 mg-10 mg dosing, is not likely to be sufficient to achieve the liver 
exposures associated with hepatotoxicity observed at higher doses (250 mg). In addition, PK simulations 
predict that liver exposures of OCA 10 mg twice weekly in patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment would be approximately equivalent to a 5 mg and 6 mg once daily dose in patients with no 
hepatic impairment. This information is considered sufficient to support the proposed dose adaptations 
for patients with hepatic impairment as outlined in the SmPC.  
Renal impairment 
No specific clinical study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of 
OCA and its metabolites is minimal, based on phase 1 data on healthy volunteers. Laboratory parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016

indicative of renal function did not show relevant changes throughout the pivotal study. Adequate 
information has been included in the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Clinical follow-up is currently limited, i.e. max 5 years, in a limited number of patients particularly in the 
elderly and in advanced stages of the disease. Further characterisation of the safety profile in these 
patient populations will be provided within studies 747-302 and 747-402 which are conditions to the 
marketing authorisation.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, treatment with OCA appears well tolerated and with an acceptable safety profile in the studied 
PBC population. The main limitations are the limited safety database and the fact that an important 
proportion of the target population has not been studied, i.e. patients with a more advanced liver disease. 
This is considered an important drawback and deficiencies on whether the observed safety profile in a 
rather mild PBC population can be extrapolated to a more severe one will need to be addressed within the 
two PAES being conditions to the marketing authorisation.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA:

a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a rare, serious, life-threatening liver disease characterized by cholestasis 
with progressive impairment of bile flow in the liver that results in increased hepatocellular bile acid 
concentrations. Bile acids at elevated hepatocellular concentrations can be toxic to the liver. Such 
hepatocellular injury results in a local inflammatory response and is signalled early on by the secretion of 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In patients with an inadequate response to therapy, the disease frequently 
progresses to hepatic fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and death unless a patient 
receives a liver transplant (Kuiper 2010). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are limited therapeutic options for PBC patients. Liver transplantation can significantly improve 
survival and pruritus in patients (Corpechot 2008, Lindor 2009). However, it is a complex, 
time-consuming operation with identified risks suitable only for patients with advanced liver disease, 
including perioperative and surgical complications, immunologic and infectious disorders, and various 
medical complications. Complications of liver transplant include bleeding, rejection, infection, and side 
effects from medications such as immunosuppressants. Furthermore, given the underlying autoimmunity 
that causes PBC, the disease can recur in a significant percentage of patients receiving liver transplants, 
with increasing likelihood over time (Silveira 2010, Lindor 2009).  
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid constituent, is the only medicine currently approved to treat 
PBC. UDCA improves biochemical indices such as ALP and bilirubin and delays histological progression 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 121/129 
 
 
 
 
 
(Poupon 1997, Corpechot 2008). The results of clinical trials of appropriate dose and length of treatment, 
in combination with well-controlled epidemiologic analyses, provide strong evidence that treatment with 
UDCA increases progression-free survival, with significantly greater benefit for patients who demonstrate 
greater response as measured by decreases in ALP, bilirubin and ALT. Accordingly, UDCA treatment has 
been recommended as first line therapy for patients with PBC in both European (European Association for 
the Study of the Liver [EASL]) and American (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
[AASLD]) treatment guidelines (Lindor 2009, EASL 2009).  
While UDCA has a marked impact on clinical outcomes in PBC, up to 50% of UDCA-treated patients either 
fail to respond or have a suboptimal response as defined based on various liver biochemistry algorithms. 
These criteria included a decrease >40% in ALP from the baseline value or decrease to a normal level 
(Parés 2006); ALP <3x ULN, AST<2x ULN, and bilirubin <ULN (Corpechot 2008, Corpechot 2011); and 
normalization of abnormal concentrations of bilirubin, albumin, or both (Kuiper 2009).  
The risk associated with non-response to UDCA is substantial. A cross-sectional study using the United 
Kingdom PBC patient cohort (UK-PBC) data indicates that this lack of response is significantly more 
common in patients who are young at disease onset or who are male, presumably reflecting an 
accelerated disease course (Carbone 2013). Fifty percent of patients in the UK-PBC study who had 
presented with PBC below the age of 50 were either in a state of UDCA non-response or had already 
undergone liver transplantation. There is an increased impact in those patients with a non-response to 
UDCA (in population terms) who develop the disease when younger given their expectations of normal 
lifespan. These patients are at significantly increased risk of an adverse outcome such as a liver transplant 
or end stage liver disease (Parés 2006, Kuiper 2009, Corpechot 2008, Kumagi 2010b, Corepchot 2011, 
Momah 2012). These findings have recently been confirmed by both the nationwide UK-PBC group (Mells 
2011) and the Global PBC Study Group (Lammers 2014). 
Furthermore, while UDCA at the recommended dosage (13 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg day) is generally well 
tolerated (Hempfling 2003, Axcan Pharma US, Inc.), there is a small subset of PBC patients who are 
unable to tolerate UDCA (primarily due to gastrointestinal symptoms) and thus are at an even greater risk 
of adverse outcome if unable to remain on therapy. 
While research has been conducted on a number of other drugs (azathioprine, methotrexate, colchicine, 
D-penicillamine, cyclosporine A, chlorambucil, glucocorticosteroids), little to no consistent research 
supports the benefit of these compounds on PBC (Rudic 2012). 
Based on the totality of evidence, there is a clear ongoing unmet medical need for second-line therapies 
in this serious, life-threatening disease, as well as other alternative therapies for the small percentage of 
patients with PBC who are unable to tolerate UDCA. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
One single pivotal study has been presented to support the efficacy of obeticholic acid (OCA) in 
combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as 
monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. The primary efficacy measure of the pivotal phase III trial 
was the percentage of subjects at Month 12 with ALP <1.67x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ULN and ALP 
decrease of ≥15% from Baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 122/129 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from the study at month 12 showed that a higher percentage of patients in the fixed OCA 10 mg 
group (n=34, 47%) achieved the primary endpoint (defined as the proportion of patients with ALP<1.67 
ULN and ≥ 15% reduction in ALP and a total bilirubin ≤ ULN at month 12) compared to placebo (n=7, 
10%), thus demonstrating superiority (p<0.0001). A higher percentage of patients (n=32, 46%) in the 
OCA titration group (key secondary endpoint) also achieved the composite endpoint, compared to 
placebo (p<0.0001). Of note, a similar proportion of patients ineligible for OCA up-titration at 6 months 
(who continued OCA treatment with the 5 mg dose) also met the primary composite endpoint at month 12 
(approximately 50%). 
Treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint was supported by additional efficacy analyses 
performed in the completer and EE populations. 
Mean absolute and percentage change from baseline to 6 and 12 months in ALP, conjugated bilirubin, 
GGT, ALT, and AST showed statistically significant differences over placebo for both OCA treatment 
groups for most of the endpoints (except LS mean percentage change of bilirubin for OCA 10mg vs. 
placebo, at 6 months). 
Responder analyses showed a higher percentage of patients in both OCA treatment groups achieved the 
ALP reduction, compared to placebo (p ≤ 0.0001) at both timepoints, 6 and 12 months. At 12 months, 
approximately one third of patients in each OCA treatment group achieved an ALP reduction of >40%, 
compared with 1% in the placebo group. 
The percentage of subjects achieving the biochemical treatment response criteria (Paris I modified, Paris 
II, Mayo II, and Toronto II), were also higher in OCA-treated patients than in the placebo group. 
In the monotherapy study (n=59), after 12 weeks of treatment, the mean percent change from baseline 
in ALP was -44.5% and -37.6% for the 10 mg and 50 mg OCA groups, respectively, in comparison to a 
0.4% increase in the placebo group (p <0.0001). 
Results from phase II trials are consistent with those of the pivotal study, which add robustness to the 
evidence provided. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data on treatment effect up to 30 month of treatment from initiation of the pivotal study is at present 
available for a limited proportion of patients. Although it is acknowledged that the use of clinical measures 
of treatment efficacy based on long-term hard end-point is largely unfeasible in a phase III trial in PBC 
patients, mainly due to time constrains, the choice of a biochemical surrogate challenges the 
interpretation of study results in terms of clinical benefit. Thus, the main uncertainty concerns to what 
extent changes in laboratory parameters correlate with clinical liver outcomes. Other important 
uncertainties are the lack of data in patients with a more advanced stage of the disease and the limited 
long-term data.  
The results from the primary composite endpoint are mainly driven by changes in ALP, since the majority 
of patients entered with normal/near normal bilirubin values (<2 ULN) and remained normal throughout 
the study duration. Furthermore, despite that approximately one third of patients in OCA treated groups 
achieved an ALP reduction of >40% at 12 months (compared to 1% in placebo), few patients achieved 
ALP normal levels (6 in the OCA-treated groups vs. none in the placebo group). In clinical practice, the 
normalization of ALP levels with UDCA in early stages of the disease has been correlated with similar 
survival rates as the general population. Nevertheless, based on the experienced gained with UDCA, OCA 
Assessment report  
EMA/725757/2016  
Page 123/129 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment resulted in changes in laboratory parameters that are indicative of a potential clinically relevant 
benefit.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
OCA has been evaluated in 1507 subjects (including PBC patients, healthy volunteers and other 
indications), who received at least one single dose. However, due to differences in dose strength and 
treatment duration, the main safety population is comprised by those patients from the pivotal study 
(n=216).   
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were pruritus (63%) and fatigue (22%).  Adverse 
reactions leading to discontinuation were 1% in the OCALIVA Titration group and 11% in the OCALIVA 10 
mg group.  Pruritus was the most frequently reported TEAE across all treatment groups (38%, 56% and 
68% in the placebo, OCA titration and OCA10mg groups, respectively). However, the majority of pruritus 
occurred within the first month of treatment and tended to resolve over time with continued dosing. 
Pruritus was included as important identified risk into the RMP and Guidance on management and dose 
adjustment for severe pruritus was included into the SmPC which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety population baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced among study 
arms and overall can be considered a mild population at an early stage of the disease. Representation of 
patients with more advanced disease and/or various degree of liver impairment was scarce. In addition, 
since patients with total bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN, severe portal hypertension or hepatic failure were excluded 
from both the main studies, no information of treatment effect is available at present in patients with 
decompensated disease.  
Hepatic effects related with disease progression (such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, oesophageal 
varices, and upper GI haemorrhage) seemed to be numerically higher in OCA-treated patients and the 
SmPC advises to monitor patients for elevation in liver enzymes and liver related adverse reactions.  
None of the clinical hepatic AEs at doses ≤10 mg were considered related to study drug by the 
Investigators or the Sponsor.  The nature of clinical hepatic-related events in patients with PBC receiving 
OCA was consistent with that reported in patients with late-stage chronic liver disease (ie, ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy, oesophageal varices), and considered likely related to disease progression.   
It is acknowledged by the CHMP that there is insufficient support to conclude on a causal association 
between liver injury and OCA at the proposed clinical doses. Therefore liver injury was qualified important 
potential risk in the RMP.  
Even though the overall incidence was low further investigations in patients with moderate and advanced 
disease (ie, Child-Pugh Class B and C), will need to be provided by means of the confirmatory studies 
747-302 supported by study 747-401 which is to be performed in patients in more advanced stages of the 
disease to exclude clinical relevance of this finding. 
The SmPC has been revised to include details regarding serious hepatic events to help health care 
professionals manage their patients appropriately. Additionally, dosage recommendations for patients 
with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment have been included which 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Lipid disorders were also reported in patients treated with OCA. Lipid disorders are commonly seen in PBC 
patients. A clear pattern for the changes could not be identified and these changes did not seem to be 
associated with the occurrence of CV AEs. Further characterization of the long-term safety of OCA with 
respect to changes in lipid levels and CVD in patients with PBC will become available by means of the 
conditions of the marketing authorization.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
PBC is a rare, progressive disorder characterised by progressive impairment of bile flow and resulting 
hepatic toxicity. Patients with PBC have limited treatment options, with UDCA being the only medicinal 
product current authorised for the treatment of PBC. Available data on UDCA treatments indicate a 
correlation between normalisation of ALP levels and progression-free survival. Up to 50% of patients do 
not satisfactorily respond to UDCA treatment or are unable to tolerate it; their prognosis is sombre, due 
to the lack of alternatives. So, for patients not achieving adequate control of the disease, despite 
treatment with UDCA or in the cases in which patients are not eligible to receive it, there is an unmet 
medical need. In this context, OCA treatment has demonstrated relevant ALP reductions in patients 
treated with a fix OCA dose of 10 mg or titrating from 5 mg up to 10 mg. 
As for UDCA, it is reasonably likely that the results on biochemical parameters translate into benefit in 
terms of clinical outcome data, although this remains to be formally demonstrated by means of the 
post-authorisation follow up within this conditional marketing authorisation.   
The safety profile appeared to be overall well tolerated and for most part manageable with supportive 
treatments (e.g. for pruritus) and/or dose adjustments.  Toxicities were generally mild-moderate, and 
resulted in infrequent dose reductions, dose interruptions, or discontinuations. Also these AEs can be 
reasonably managed with implemented recommendations in the SmPC. 
Therefore, at this stage OCA is presented as a suitable treatment option for those patients in need for 
further treatment to prevent or delay PBC progression. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the beneficial effect of OCA is currently based on changes in biochemical parameters. Although 
very  limited  clinical  data  (such  as  histology  or  different  measurements  of  parameters  of  fibrosis)  are 
currently available sufficient correlation has been established between ALP levels and liver outcomes from 
previous clinical experience with UDCA. 
Although not yet demonstrated by clinical outcome parameters, available data are sufficiently indicative 
of a clinically relevant benefit in the treatment of PBC in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or 
as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.  
The existing evidence demonstrated the benefits of OCA to a degree that allows them to be assessed 
against the overall well tolerated and manageable safety profile in the studies conducted and the risks 
related to the absence of data. 
In particular the lack of direct clinical evidence showing the extent of efficacy and safety also in the long 
term treatment and in more advanced liver disease stages will be addressed within the conditions of the 
marketing authorisation. This is considered acceptable due to the lack of treatment options in this second 
line  indication  of  a  severely  debilitating  disease.  Furthermore  the  SmPC  cautions  adequately  about 
availability of limited data in patients with hepatic impairment and provides reasonable dose adjustments. 
The benefit risk of OCALIVA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (also known as primary biliary 
cirrhosis)  in  combination  with  ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  in  adults  with  an  inadequate  response  to 
UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA is considered to be positive in the context of 
this CMA.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As  comprehensive  data  on  the  product  are  not  available,  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  was 
requested by the applicant during the procedure. 
The product falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional marketing 
authorizations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating and life-threatening disease and is 
designated as an orphan medicinal product:  
PBC is a rare, chronic, serious, life-threatening liver disease that progresses to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, 
debilitating hepatic decompensation and death unless a patient receives a liver transplant (Kaplan 2005).  
Without therapeutic intervention, the combined effects of chronic cholestasis and bile-duct destruction 
ultimately lead to progressive liver impairment culminating in liver failure resulting in liver transplant or 
death.  The 10-year survival of asymptomatic patients in 3 contemporary series ranged from 50% to 
70%. 
OCA for the treatment of PBC was granted Orphan Designation from the EMA COMP on 27 Jul 2010, as the 
prevalence of the disease was below the EMA and COMP’s statutory threshold (no more than 5 in 10,000).  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is considered sufficiently likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data: 
Study 747-302 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, international study being conducted to confirm 
the clinical benefit associated with OCA treatment in patients with PBC who are either unresponsive 
or intolerant to UDCA treatment based on clinical endpoints. 
Study 747-401 is a phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of obeticholic acid in patients with primary biliary cholangitis 
and moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
To assure timely completion of the studies the applicant is committed to conducting regular ongoing 
assessments of patient recruitment, retention and event rate accrual over the course of study 
conduct. The CHMP/Rapporteurs will be provided with annual updates of key study metrics, including 
enrolment updates and details on event accrual. The Applicant is further committed to notifying the 
CHMP/Rapporteurs immediately in the case of any unforeseen delays or issues with study conduct, or 
recommendations from the DMC to alter the conduct of the study. This was accepted by the CHMP.   
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only medicine currently 
approved to treat PBC. Up to 50% of patients do not satisfactorily respond to UDCA treatment or are 
unable to tolerate it; their prognosis is sombre, due to the lack of alternatives. As discussed above 
available data are sufficiently indicative of a clinically relevant benefit in the treatment of PBC in 
combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as 
monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. The positive benefit risk of OCALIVA and the lack of treatment 
options in this second line indication of a severely debilitating / life threatening disease outweighs the 
risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of OCALIVA is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of OCALIVA is favourable in the following indication: 
OCALIVA is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (also known as primary biliary 
cirrhosis) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to 
UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.

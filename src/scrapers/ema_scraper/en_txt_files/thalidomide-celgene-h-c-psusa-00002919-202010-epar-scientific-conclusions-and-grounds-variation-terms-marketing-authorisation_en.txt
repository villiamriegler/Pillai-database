Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  thalidomide,  the  scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on hypothyroidism from cumulative review and based on a possible class effect, 
the PRAC Rapporteur considers that addition of the class wording on monitoring of the thyroid function 
is  warranted,  in  addition  to  the  information  already  provided  regarding  this  risk  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmPC. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing thalidomide 
should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for thalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing thalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

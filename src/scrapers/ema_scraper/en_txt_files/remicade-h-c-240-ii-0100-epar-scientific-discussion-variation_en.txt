Introduction 
Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine IgG1κ monoclonal antibody, which binds to both soluble and 
transmembrane forms of the human tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α and inhibits the functional activity 
of TNFα.  
Remicade (infliximab) is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), adult and 
paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis and 
ulcerative colitis (UC). 
PsA  is  a  chronic,  inflammatory,  usually  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)-negative  arthritis  associated  with 
psoriasis.  According  to  EU  guidance  for  treating  PsA,  psoriasis  is  prevalent  in  1%  to  3%  of  the 
population. Estimates of those psoriasis patients who develop PsA vary widely (6%-42%). Affecting 
men  and  women  equally,  PsA  typically  appears  between  the  ages  of  30  and  50  years.  PsA  usually 
involves multiple peripheral joints, the axial skeleton, sacroiliac joints, fingernails, and entheses. The 
presentation  of  PsA  has  been  categorised  into  5  overlapping  clinical  patterns,  which  include 
oligoarthritis,  polyarthritis,  arthritis  of  distal  interphalangeal  (DIP)  joints,  spondylitis,  and  arthritis 
mutilans. More than one-half of the patients with PsA may have evidence of erosions on X-rays, and 
up to 40% of the patients may develop severe, erosive arthropathy. 
The  MAH  (marketing  authorisation  holder)  applied  to  change  the  PsA  indication,  adding  that 
infliximab  has  been  shown  to  improve  physical  function  and  inhibit  the  progression  of  structural 
damage of active arthritis, as measured by X-ray. 
The  current  approved  dose  of  infliximab  for  treating  active  and  progressive  PsA  is  5  mg/kg, 
administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by a maintenance regimen q8 (every 8) weeks. Infliximab 
may be administered in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or as monotherapy in patients who are 
intolerant  to  MTX  or  have  a  contraindication  to  the  use  of  MTX.  The  same  dosing  regimen  is 
supported by additional data demonstrating inhibition of structural damage. 
Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  development  program  for  infliximab  for  the  treatment  of  PsA  consisted  of  2  controlled 
clinical trials, IMPACT (study P02114) and IMPACT II (study C0168T50). 
Study P02114 (IMPACT) 
Design: An investigator-initiated, multicentre study in subjects with PsA and peripheral polyarticular 
arthritis  who  had  failed  at  least  1  disease  modifying  antirheumatic  drug  (DMARD).  This  study  was 
conducted  at  9  study  centres  in  Austria,  Canada,  England,  Germany,  and  the  US.  The  study  design 
included a 16-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment (Stage I), followed by a 
34-week, open-label treatment period (Stage II).  
Objectives:  The  primary  objective  was  to  study  efficacy  (ACR201)  of  infliximab  compared  with 
placebo  at  week  16  and  to  determine  safety  of  infliximab.  Secondary  objectives  were  to  follow 
response  of  skin  involvement,  percentage  ACR20  over  time,  and  ACR50  and  70,  Disease  activity 
score  (DAS),  Psoriatic  arthritis  response  criteria  (PsARC),  AUC  percentage,  ACR  improvement 
(ACRn), and change in joint scores at week 16 and week 50. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects had to be 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis 
of  active  PsA  with  peripheral  polyarticular  involvement  and  at  least  one  of  the  following:  Distal 
phalangeal  (DIP)  involvement,  polyarticular  arthritis,  with  absence  of  rheumatoid  nodules  and 
1  ACR,  American  College  of  Rheumatology  response  criteria.  The  ACR  response  criteria  were  developed  for  RA.  The 
ACR20 criteria is defined as a ≥20% reduction in the tender joint count, a ≥20% reduction in the swollen joint count and a 
≥20% reduction in 3 of 5 additional measures: a) patient assessment of pain, b) patient global assessment of disease activity, 
c) physician global assessment of disease activity, d) disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and, e) 
acute phase reactant.

presence of psoriasis, arthritis mutilans or asymmetric peripheral arthritis, negative RA-factor, at least 
6 months since diagnosis. Subjects should have had at least 1 DMARD failure. If on a DMARD, the 
dose must had been stable since 4 weeks. Corticosteroids were allowed if stable <10mg/day. 
Number of Subjects: The study initially enrolled 104 subjects, of whom 87 completed year 1. Seventy 
eight (78) subjects continued treatment in year 2. 
Treatment:  
Stage I: subjects were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo infusions at weeks 
0, 2, 6, and 14.  
Stage  II:  subjects  on  placebo  initially  and  at  weeks  16,  18,  were  crossed  over  to  receive  5  mg/kg 
infliximab at weeks, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Subjects who had been receiving infliximab received infusions 
of placebo at weeks 16 and 18 (to maintain the blind) and infusions of infliximab at weeks 22, 30, 38, 
and 46. All subjects were followed until week 50. Thereafter subjects joined the open label long-term 
extension to 2 years.  
Study C0168T50 (IMPACT 2) 
Design: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for 24 weeks, with 2 parallel 
treatment  groups  (placebo  and  infliximab  5  mg/kg)  of  subjects  with  active  polyarticular  PsA.  After 
week 24, placebo patients were switched to infliximab, although they could enter early escape already 
at week 16. Subjects could dose escalate at week 38. All subjects received treatment up to week 46.  
Objectives:  The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  infliximab  in  subjects  with  active 
PsA  by  assessing  reduction  in  signs  and  symptoms  of  arthritis  and  prevention  of  structural  damage. 
The major secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab in: 1) achieving ACR 20 
sustained  response,  2)  achieving  the  PsARC,  3)  clearing  psoriatic  skin  lesions,  and  4)  improving 
quality of life in subjects with PsA.  
Number  of  Subjects:  Two  hundred  subjects  (planned)  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  infliximab 
5 mg/kg (n = 100) or placebo (n = 100).  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects had to be 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis 
of  active,  polyarticular  (5 or  more  joints  involved)  peripheral  PsA  for  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the 
first  infusion,  and  with  an  inadequate  response  to  current  or  previous  DMARD  or  NSAID  (non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) therapy. Diagnosis of PsA must have included the presence of active 
psoriasis. Concomitant MTX at stable doses was permitted, but not required. 
Mode of Administration Infliximab 5 mg/kg was infused at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46; at 
weeks 16, 18, 22, 30, 38, and 46 for placebo subjects who entered early escape, and at weeks 24, 26, 
30, 38, and 46 for placebo subjects who crossed over to infliximab. Infliximab 10 mg/kg was infused 
at weeks 38 and 46 for subjects who dose escalated. 
Efficacy:  The  primary  endpoints  were  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  ACR  20  response  at  week  14 
(not  further  addressed  within  the  current  assessment  as  not  relevant  to  the  claimed  extension  of 
indication) and the change from baseline in the total modified van der Heijde modified Sharp (vdH-S)2 
score  at  week  24.  In  addition,  other  secondary  endpoints  and  exploratory  endpoints  related  to 
structural  damage  were  evaluated.  Maintenance  of  responses  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  arthritis, 
physical function, skin disease, and quality of life endpoints were summarised through week 54. 
2 The vDH-S score is a detailed scoring method evaluating erosions, joint space narrowing, (sub)luxation, ankylosis, gross 
osteolysis, and pencil in cup phenomena.

Clinical efficacy 
Radiographic assessments 
In IMPACT, radiographic images of the hands and feet were taken at baseline, week 50 and week 98 
in the long-term extension. The radiographs of all subjects were scored by 2 independent readers for 
joint erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) based on the vdH-S score (van der Heijde et al, 1992) 
modified by the addition of hand DIP joints. In addition, the readers assessed the radiographs for PC 
("pencil in cup" deformity) and GO (gross osteolysis), radiographic features characteristic of PsA. The 
erosion scores for the hand region and the foot region were a summation of the erosion scores in 40 
joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet. Erosions for each hand joint were scored from 0 to 7, and 
in the feet from were scored 1 to 10 (0 = no erosion in both case). The JSN scores (from 0 to 4, where 
0  indicated  no/normal  JSN)  for  the  hand  region  and  the  foot  region  were  a  summation  of  the  JSN 
scores  in  40  joints  of  the  hands  and  12  joints  of  the  feet.  The  total  PsA-modified  vdH-S  score  was 
calculated  as  the  sum  of  erosion  and  JSN  scores  from  the  hand  and  foot  regions  averaged  by  the  2 
readers; ranging from 0-528.  
In IMPACT 2, structural damage was assessed by the change from baseline in the total modified vdH-
S score at weeks 24, 54 and at the time of study termination if the study termination occurred more 
than 8 weeks from the last radiograph. Erosions for each hand joint were scored from 0 to 7, and in 
feet  from  0-12  (0  =  no  erosion).  JSN  was  scored  from  0  to  4  (0  indicates  no/normal  JSN.  The  total 
modified vdH-S score was calculated as the sum from the hand and foot regions, ranging from 0-528. 
Radiographic analyses  
Smallest detectable difference (SDD) and smallest detectable change (SDC) 
In IMPACT 2, radiographic progression at week 24 was defined as a worsening from baseline in the 
modified  vdH-S  score  that  was  greater  than  the  smallest  detectable  difference  (SDD)  based  on  the 
limits  of  agreement  (Lassere  et  al,  1999),  defined  as  the  95%  confidence  limits  of  the  difference 
between  the  2 observed  changes  for  the  same  subject  and  was  calculated  as  2.77  x  within  subject 
standard deviation of the change score (Bland and Altman, 1996). Change from baseline at week 24 
was used to calculate the SDD. SDD is related to repeatability. SDC is the 95% confidence limits of 
the  difference  between  a  subject's  observed  change  and  true  change  (Bland  and  Altman,  1996).  The 
SDC  is  SDD  divided  by  square  root  of  2  (van  der  Heijde  et  al,  2005)  and  was  calculated  as 
1.96 × within  subject  standard  deviation  of  the  change  score.  Change  from  baseline  at  week  24  was 
used to calculate the SDC. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  use  of  the  modified  vdH-S  score  for  the  evaluation  of  the  X-rays  was 
acceptable. It was noted that there is less knowledge about the ‘natural’ progression rate in PsA, but 
that  it  appears  to  be  more  variable  than  in  RA.  Thus,  the  CHMP  considered  it  to  be  even  more 
important in this indication to have a placebo group which progresses, to demonstrate reduced rate of 
structural damage.  
Estimates of progression rate before start of treatments 
For IMPACT, the MAH estimated the average annual progression rate in radiographic damage before 
treatment  with  the  study  agent,  based  on  calculations  considering  the  duration  of  PsA  symptoms  in 
years. The MAH claimed that estimating progression from the start of symptoms rather than the date 
of diagnosis is a conservative approach and takes into account radiographic progression that may have 
occurred  prior  to  diagnosis.  Table  1  presents  a  summary  of  the  average  annual  progression  rates  in 
total  modified  vdH-S  score  prior  to  the  study  and  during  the  study  (to  week  98)  and  shows  the 
difference between the prestudy progression rate and the progression rate observed during the study.

Table 1 
The CHMP noted that there is limited insufficient knowledge on the relation between progression rate, 
and  duration  of  disease  (occurrence  of  symptoms  and/or  diagnosis),  and  if  the  progression  rate  is 
linear. There was a clear difference in the estimated average annual progression rate prior to the study 
in  the  two  groups  (e.g.  mean  3.1  +  3.6  and  8.7  +  23),  despite  the  fact  that  groups  were  fairly  well 
balanced at study start. The MAH justified the chosen starting point and the CHMP reiterated that to 
analyse the estimated annual progression rate before and at the end of infliximab treatment by dividing 
baseline PsA modified vdH-S score by the number of years of PsA symptom duration does not seem 
very reliable but rather a limited comparator.  
Results 
IMPACT 
Radiographs were obtained from 90 of the 104 subjects enrolled in IMPACT. Of the 90 subjects who 
had  radiographs  obtained,  71  subjects  had  evaluable  radiographs  of  both  hands  and  feet  at  both 
baseline  and  week  50.  Group  I  was  the  placebo/infliximab  group,  Group  II  received  infliximab 
throughout the study. The Tables 2 to 4 below show main results from this study.

Table 4 
The CHMP considered the value of IMPACT being limited for several reasons. Firstly, X-rays were 
only available from a limited number of subjects. Secondly the duration of the placebo treatment was 
short  (16 weeks),  and  there  were  no  X-rays  taken  until  week  52;  thus  when  subjects  had  received 
infliximab  for  either  52  or  approximately  36  weeks.  Therefore,  it  was  not  possible  to  estimate  the 
number of patients with no progression during placebo treatment. This is a shortcoming as, at week 
50, a very high percentage of the patients, 85% in Group I and 84% in Group II had no progression in 
the  total  vdH-score.  Finally,  the  reference  to  annual  progression  rate  prior  to  study  start  was 
considered of a limited value. Nevertheless, the fact that the progression rate during study period was 
generally small is supportive of an effect. Also the limited numbers of severe X-ray findings and no 
occurrence of new severe damage were considered reassuring. Still, there is no possibility to, based on 
these  data,  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  effect,  or  to  find  out  who  is  responding  or  progressing.  The 
year 2 data are even more limited (in total 43 subjects on infliximab). X-ray films were missing for a 
number of subjects, as the study protocol indicated that X-rays were “possibly taken” at week 98.  
IMPACT 2 
The MAH indicated that in IMPACT 2, there was a significant difference in the distribution of change 
from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at week 24 for the infliximab group compared with the 
placebo group (see Table 5 below). At Year 1, the infliximab group had significantly less progression 
of structural damage compared with the placebo group that consisted of subjects who had crossed over 
to infliximab treatment at 6 months. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  placebo  controlled  data  at  week  24  indicated  fewer  subjects  with 
progression  in  the  infliximab  group  (3/100)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (12/100).  Very  few 
subjects  appeared  to  progress  in  the  active  treatment  period,  from  week  24  to  week  54  (7/200). 
However, the CHMP considered that a proper evaluation of IMPACT 2 results was difficult due to the 
lack of historical data as well as the limited placebo-controlled period of the study.

Table 5 
Subgroup Analyses in IMPACT2 related to Structural Damage 
The CHMP noted that there was a tendency towards less effect in the asymmetric arthritis group, i.e. 
the more typical PsA patients. A thorough subgroup analysis (including symmetric versus asymmetric 
arthritis) in relation to radiographic results was requested. The subgroup analyses were submitted for 
IMPACT 2, as no data were collected in IMPACT on PsA subtypes (see table 6 below). Based on the 
data presented, the placebo group progressed least in the asymmetric subgroup, while a slightly higher 
rate of progression was seen in the other subgroups. In the infliximab groups, there was no progression 
in  any  subgroup.  However,  this  period  is  too  short  to  adequately  assess  the  effects  of  infliximab  on 
progression of joint damage, since the progression rate in the placebo group is uncertain, and there is 
insufficient  data  on  the  natural  progression  rate  in  PsA.  On  the  other  hand,  some  support  may  be 
gained from RA, where more convincing data are available, from 2 years treatment with infliximab. 
Given  that  the  symmetric  PsA  shows  greatest  resemblance  with  RA,  and  the  PsA  data  are  more 
convincing in the symmetric patients, it may be accepted to include reduction of rate of progression 
into section 4.1 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC).

Pencil-in-cup Deformity (PC) and Gross Osteolysis (GO) (both studies) 
The modified vdH-S scoring method incorporates separate assessments for 2 types of severe erosive 
processes associated with PsA: PC deformity, in which an osseous surface on the proximal bone of a 
joint protrudes into the expanded surface of the distal bone, and GO, which is characterized by gross 
destruction of the bone.  
In IMPACT 2, few subjects had evidence of these severe erosive processes at baseline and there was 
little  change  in  the  number  of  joints  with  or  without  PC  and  GO  at  week  24  or  week  54.  Also  in 
IMPACT, there was little change in the number of joints with or without PC and GO from baseline at 
week  98  in  either  group.  None  of  the  subjects  without  PC  or  GO  at  baseline  were  found  to  have 
developed these conditions at the week 98 follow-up. Overall, these data support slow progression in 
all subjects  
Conclusion on efficacy: 
Documentation  to  support  the  sought  indication  included  data  from  two  studies,  IMPACT  and 
IMPACT 2. The value of IMPACT was considered  limited for several reasons. Firstly, X-rays were 
only  available  from  a  limited  number  of  subjects.  Secondly,  in  IMPACT,  no  X-ray  evaluation  was 
performed at the end of the placebo period of 16 weeks. Therefore, it was not possible to estimate the 
number of patients with no progression during placebo treatment. This is a shortcoming as at week 50, 
a very high percentage of the patients, 85% in Group I and 84% in Group II had no progression in the 
total  vdH-score.  Furthermore,  the  estimated  annual  progression  rate  prior  to  study  start  was  very 
uncertain.  
IMPACT 2 provided placebo controlled data at week 24. This period is too short to adequately assess 
the  effects  of  infliximab  on  progression  of  joint  damage,  since  the  progression  rate  in  the  placebo 
group is uncertain, and there is insufficient data on the natural progression rate in PsA. Nevertheless, 
available data indicated that there were fewer subjects who progressed in the infliximab group (3/100) 
compared  with  the  placebo  group  (12/100)  at  week  24.  Very  few  appear  to  progress  in  the  active 
treatment period, from week 24 to week 54 (7/200). Subgroup analyses were provided. At week 24, it 
appears  that  the  placebo  group  progressed  least  in  the  asymmetric  subgroup,  while  a  slightly  higher 
rate of progression was seen in the other subgroups. In the infliximab groups, there was no progression 
in  any  subgroup.  Given  that  the  symmetric  PsA  shows  greatest  resemblance  with  RA,  where  more 
convincing  data  are  available,  and  the  PsA  data  are  more  convincing  in  the  symmetric  patients,  the 
CHMP accepted the inclusion of wording into section 4.1. 
Clinical safety 
The  safety  in  the  performed  studies  had  been  assessed  within  previous  variation  procedures,  and  in 
assessments of PSURs. There were no new data that altered previously adopted conclusions.  
Risk management plan 
The  MAH  argued  that  there  was  no  need  for  a  RMP  to  be  provided  for  the  current  variation 
application. The CHMP agreed with this approach, and noted that the MAH is currently working on a 
RMP for infliximab, which will be submitted later this year.

Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment  
Remicade  has  previously  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of  RA,  AS  and  PsA/psoriasis.  These 
inflammatory  conditions  are  to  some  extent  similar  with  joint  involvement  and  development  of 
structural  damage  of  varying  severity  and  degree.  Besides  inflammatory  control,  reduction  of  the 
structural damage is one of the main goals of treatment. 
Benefit  
Documentation  to  support  the  sought  indication  included  data  from  two  studies,  IMPACT  and 
IMPACT  2.  The  value  of  IMPACT  was  considered  limited  and  considered  of  insufficient  value  to 
warrant inclusion in the SPC.  
IMPACT 2 provided placebo controlled data at week 24, indicating fewer subjects with progression in 
the infliximab group (3/100) compared with the placebo group (12/100). Very few appear to progress 
in the active treatment period, from week 24 to week 54 (7/200). However, as historical data as well as 
placebo-controlled data are limited, a proper evaluation of IMPACT 2 results was considered difficult.  
Subgroup analyses were submitted for three groups; arthritis involving DIPs, asymmetrical peripheral 
arthritis,  and  polyarticular  arthritis.  Data  were  collected  in  the  study  specifically  for  “polyarticular 
arthritis” and “asymmetrical peripheral arthritis”, which correspond to “symmetric polyarthritis” and 
“oligoarticular arthritis”, respectively. Consequently, it is assumed that patients not having asymmetric 
disease, had symmetric disease.  
Looking  at  the  X-ray  data  at  weeks  24,  it  appears  that  the  placebo  group  progressed  least  in  the 
asymmetric subgroup, while a slightly higher rate of progression was seen in the other subgroups. In 
the infliximab groups, there was no progression in any subgroup. However, this period was considered 
too  short  to  adequately  assess  the  effects  of  infliximab  on  progression  of  joint  damage,  since  the 
progression  rate  in  the  placebo  group  is  uncertain,  and  there  is  insufficient  data  on  the  natural 
progression  rate  in  PsA.  On  the  other  hand,  some  support  may  be  gained  from  RA,  where  more 
convincing data are available, from 2 years treatment with infliximab. Given that the symmetric PsA 
shows greatest resemblance with RA, and the PsA data are more convincing in the symmetric patients, 
it was accepted to include some wording into section 4.1.  
Data on physical function were assessed within variation II-73, which resulted in wording in section 
5.1 of the SPC. The application to include ‘improvement of physical function’ also in section 4.1 was 
therefore agreed.  
Risk  
No new safety data were submitted in this application.  
Benefit-Risk Balance  
Overall, the benefit /risk balance for the treatment of PsA remains positive.  
CONCLUSION 
On 18 October 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the SPC and package leaflet.

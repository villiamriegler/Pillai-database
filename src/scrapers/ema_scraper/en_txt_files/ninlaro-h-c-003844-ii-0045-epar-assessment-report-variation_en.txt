Submission of the Clinical Study Report (Addendum 2) for study C16019 listed as a Specific Obligation 
in  the  Annex  II  of  the  Product  Information.  This  is  a  phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  of  single-agent  oral  ixazomib  as  maintenance  therapy  following  autologous  stem  cell 
transplant (ASCT) for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. In addition, the MAH proposes 
to remove NINLARO from the list of medicines subject to additional monitoring and to remove the black 
triangle from the SmPC. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP version 
10.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial 
changes to the PI and update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
On  November  2016  Ninlaro  was  granted  conditional  marketing  authorisation  (CMA)  following  re-
examination for the treatment, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd regimen), of 
adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy (R/R MM).  
Supporting data were not considered comprehensive since OS results from pivotal study C16010 were 
not sufficiently mature; moreover, in the updated (yet not inferential by study design) set of data at the 
time  of  the  second  interim  analysis  (IA)  for  PFS,  the  results  were  less  convincing,  with  a  borderline 
statistical significance (PFS HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67, 1.00; p= 0.054). Furthermore, inconsistencies were 
observed in the treatment effect across relevant subgroups: e.g. in the large (60% of the ITT population) 
subset of patients with one single prior line of treatment the HR for PFS was 0.88 (95% CI 0.65, 1.20) 
in the first IA and 0.99 (95% CI 0.76, 1.29) in the more mature second IA. 
Four  SOBs  and  one  Annex  II.D  PAES  were  agreed  with  the  MAH  to  provide  additional  information  on 
ixazomib efficacy and safety: SOB002 (C16010 - China continuation study), ANX001 (final OS data from 
registrational  Phase  III  study  C16010)  and  SOB005  (observational  study  MSMM-5001  to  provide  RW 
data) were designed to further investigate the efficacy of the approved IRd combination in the target 
population; SOB003 (modified IRd in frail patients with newly diagnosed MM – Phase III Study C16014) 
and SOB004 (ixazomib monotherapy as post-ASCT maintenance – Study C16019) were to provide data 
on the activity of Ninlaro in earlier settings of disease.   
SOB004 is the only SOB for Ninlaro that is still outstanding.

In the context of the Ninlaro CMA, the original aim of SOB004 was to substantiate the clinical activity 
and safety of Ninlaro in an earlier MM setting. PFS data from the first IA of study C16019 were submitted 
on  December  2018  (see  also  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G)  and  showed  that  prolonged 
exposure  to  ixazomib  monotherapy  after  ASCT  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  PFS 
compared to placebo (median PFS by IRC 26.5 months with ixazomib and 21.3 months with placebo, HR 
0.72;  95%CI  0.58,  0.89;  p=0.002).  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified,  and  the  updated  data 
submitted in the context of this variation confirmed that no increase in the risk of NPM was associated 
with prolonged treatment with ixazomib. However, the point estimates for OS and PFS2 did not exclude 
a  potential  detrimental  effect  (HR  1.165,  95%CI  0.761,  1.779  and  HR  1.160;  95%CI  0.810,  1.662, 
respectively). A similar trend was also observed in phase III study C16021 (not a PAM for Ninlaro) which 
investigated  the  effect  of  ixazomib  maintenance  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  MM  not  eligible  for 
transplantation.  Out  of  caution,  the  CHMP  decided  to  amend  SOB004  in  order  to  provide  additional 
OS/PFS2 data from study C16019 when approximately 200 death events would have occurred.  
Updated data from study C16019 were submitted in the context of CMA annual renewal procedures and 
were consistent with the first IA. IA2 for OS was conducted on January 2020 with a median follow-up of 
approximately  4.5  years:  22%  of  patients  (142  of  656)  had  died  and  the  OS  HR  was  1.029  (95%CI 
0.734, 1.441; p=0.868). IA3 was conducted on January 2021: 27% of patients (174 of 656) had died 
and the OS HR was 1.008 (95%CI 0.744, 1.367; p=0.958). 
In compliance with the established timeframe, the MAH has now submitted the results from OS IA4 to 
fulfil SOB004. IA4 is the most recent IA for Study C16019, with a DCO date of 12 October 2022; at this 
time,  209  deaths  occurred  in  Study  C16019.  Updated  OS  and  PFS2  data  showed  that  the  HR  for  OS 
(1.074, 95%CI 0.812, 1.421), although reduced compared to IA2, was still slightly in favour of placebo. 
A similar trend could be observed for PFS2 (HR of 1.016, 95%CI 0.791, 1.305). Pre-specified and ad hoc 
sensitivity analyses for OS were provided to assess whether a true detrimental effect on survival could 
be associated with prolonged exposure to ixazomib. The interpretation of these analyses was, however, 
not straightforward because of methodological limits (e.g. the reliability of MSM and IPCW techniques 
was hampered by the high clinical and biological heterogeneity of MM) and because some results were, 
apparently, counterintuitive (e.g. the reported “protective” effect of subsequent exposure to PIs after 
ixazomib failure). Results from these post hoc, non-randomised analyses should, anyway, be considered 
with caution due to the significant risk of bias. 
Based  on  HR  estimates,  the  possibility  of  an  actual  detrimental  effect  on  survival  with  ixazomib 
monotherapy cannot be formally excluded. However, it should be considered that KM curves for OS run 
largely  superimposed  and  repeatedly  crossed  over  time,  without  showing  any  clear  trend  towards 
differences between arms. Moreover, no unexpected safety concern was identified in study C16019. 
Further, the lack of OS benefit with ixazomib maintenance is not unexpected, since no trial investigating 
the  use  of  a  PI  as  post-ASCT  maintenance  treatments  has  been  able  to  demonstrate  a  significant 
advantage in OS (see e.g. Goldschmidt H et al, Leukemia 2018; Rosinol L et al, Leukemia 2017). Finally, 
several  effective  options  have  become  available  in  the  last  years  for  subjects  with  R/R  MM,  and  it  is 
uncertain to what extent the limited 5-month PFS gain observed in study C16019 in an early setting of 
disease could be reflected in meaningful gains in terms of OS. 
Notably, long-term OS data in the approved indication from registrational study C16010 (ANX001 Annex 
II  PAES,  see  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0033)  and  the  supportive  “China  continuation  study” 
(SOB002,  see  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0002)  were  not  suggestive  of  potential  detrimental 
effects  on  survival.  Further,  RW  data  from  observational  study  MSMM-5001  (SOB005,  see  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0041) also did not raise any concern with respect to a potential detrimental effect 
on OS of the IRd combination in the target population.

Page 5/38 
 
 
 
In conclusion, data from SOB004 have confirmed that prolonged exposure to ixazomib monotherapy in 
an early setting of MM can result in a limited yet statistically significant PFS prolongation in the absence 
of  new  safety  concerns,  supporting  the  anti-MM  activity  of  Ninlaro.  Although  PFS2 and  OS  data  from 
SOB004  did  not  allow  to  clearly  exclude  a  possible  detrimental  effect  with  post-ASCT  ixazomib 
maintenance,  post-approval  conditions  ANX001,  SOB002  and  SOB005  did  not  identify  any  concern 
related to a potential detrimental effect with ixazomib when used in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone  in  the  currently  approved  indication.  On  these  grounds,  SOB004  can  be  considered 
fulfilled.  
Based on the totality of data from the SOBs and Annex II.D PAES, the Rapporteur’s opinion is that there 
are no remaining grounds for the marketing authorisation of Ninlaro to remain conditional, and that the 
deletion of the last specific obligation from Annex II can, therefore, be agreed. Since more than 5 years 
have passed after the URD and all the SOBs have  been fulfilled, it is also agreed that Ninlaro can be 
removed from the additional monitoring list. 
The benefit-risk balance of Ninlaro in the approved indication is positive.

5.  Introduction 
On November 2016 Ninlaro was granted conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the treatment, in 
combination  with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (IRd  regimen),  of  adult  patients  with  multiple 
myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy (R/R MM). Despite the B/R of the IRd triplet 
in the approved indication was considered positive, the available data were not considered sufficiently 
comprehensive to adequately characterise the efficacy of Ninlaro. In particular, concerns were present 
on  the  extent  of  the  long-term  clinical  benefit  with  IRD,  since  OS  in  pivotal  study  C16010  was  not 
sufficiently mature and, in the more mature (yet not inferential by study design) set of data at the time 
of  the  second  interim  analysis  for  PFS,  the  results  were  less  convincing,  with  a  borderline  statistical 
significance (PFS HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67, 1.00; p= 0.054). Further, inconsistencies were observed in the 
treatment  effect  across  relevant  subgroups:  e.g.  in  the  large  (60%  of  the  ITT  population)  subset  of 
patients with one single prior line of treatment the HR for PFS was 0.88 (95% CI 0.65, 1.20) in the first 
interim analysis and 0.99 (95% CI 0.76, 1.29) in the more mature second interim analysis. 
Four SOBs and one Annex II PAES were, therefore, agreed with the MAH to provide additional information 
on  ixazomib  efficacy:  SOB002  (C16010  -  China  continuation  study),  ANX001  (final  OS  data  from 
registrational  Phase  III  study  C16010)  and  SOB005  (observational  study  MSMM-5001  to  provide  RW 
data) were designed to further investigate the efficacy of the approved IRd combination in the target 
population; SOB003 (modified IRd in frail patients with newly diagnosed MM – Phase III Study C16014) 
and SOB004 (ixazomib monotherapy as post-ASCT maintenance – Study C16019) were to provide data 
on the activity of Ninlaro in earlier settings of disease.   
SOB004 is currently the only SOB for Ninlaro that is still outstanding. In line with the agreed timeframe, 
data  from  study  C16019  were  submitted  on  December  2018  in  the  context  of  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G.  Results  from  the  first  interim  analysis  (IA)  showed  a  statistically 
significant PFS improvement vs. placebo (mPFS by IRC 26.5 months with ixazomib vs. 21.3 months with 
placebo,  HR  0.72,  p=0.002),  yet  the  point  estimates  for  OS  and  PFS2  did  not  exclude  a  potential 
detrimental effect (HR 1.165, 95%CI 0.761, 1.779 and HR 1.160; 95% CI: 0.810, 1.662, respectively). 
A similar trend was observed in phase III study C16021 (not included as SOB) investigating the effect 
of  ixazomib  maintenance  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  MM  not  eligible  for  transplantation. 
Acknowledging  the  significant  differences  in  patient  population  and  administration  regimen  between 
study C16019 and the approved indication for Ninlaro, the CHMP decided to amend SOB004 in order to 
provide more mature PFS2/OS data. 
From a safety perspective, updated data have confirmed, so far, the known toxicity profile of ixazomib.  
Updated data from study C16019 were submitted in the context of CMA annual renewal procedures and 
were consistent with the first IA. IA2 for OS was conducted with a DCO date of 27 January 2020 at a 
median follow-up of approximately 4.5 years; as of IA2, 22% of patients (142 of 656) had died and the 
OS HR was 1.029 (95% CI 0.734, 1.441; p=0.868). IA3 was conducted with a DCO date of 29 January 
2021; as of IA3, 27% of patients (174 of 656) had died and the OS HR was 1.008 (95% CI 0.744, 1.367; 
p = 0.958). 
Conforming with the established timeframe, the MAH has submitted the results from IA4 to comply with 
SOB004. IA4 is the most recent IA for Study C16019, with a DCO date of 12 October 2022; at this time, 
209 deaths had occurred in Study C16019.

6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study  C16019  was  a  phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study  of 
patients  with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  (NDMM)  who  had  undergone  induction  therapy 
according  to  regional  standard  of  care,  followed  by  a  conditioning  regimen  containing  high-dose 
melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT).  
Study design is summarised in Figure below: 
The  study  included  adult  patients  18  years  or  older  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  symptomatic  MM 
according  to  standard  criteria,  who  underwent  standard-of-care  induction  therapy  (induction  therapy 
must have included PI- and/or IMiD-based regimens as primary therapy for MM), followed by a single 
ASCT  with a high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2) conditioning regimen, within 12 months of diagnosis. 
Vincristine,  Adriamycin  (doxorubicin),  and  dexamethasone  (VAD)  was  not  an  acceptable  induction

therapy for this study. A response to ASCT (PR, VGPR, CR/stringent complete response [sCR]) according 
to  IMWG  criteria  should  have  been  documented.  Patients  who  received  consolidation  therapy  were 
excluded, a s well as subjects with central nervous system involvement.  
The study primary objective was to determine the effect of ixazomib maintenance on progression-free 
survival  (PFS)  by  a  blinded  independent  review  committee  (IRC)  compared  to  placebo.  The  key 
secondary  objective  was  to  determine  whether  ixazomib  maintenance  could  improve  overall  survival 
(OS). 
Approximately 652 patients were to be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to ixazomib maintenance or placebo. 
There were two planned interim analyses (IAs) and one final analysis (FA): the first IA was the primary 
analysis (and the only analysis) for PFS for statistical testing purposes, with the opportunity to claim PFS 
benefit.  Only  if  PFS  was  significant  at  the  first  IA,  then  OS  was  to  be  tested  at  this  first  IA  and  at 
subsequent  analyses  until  statistical  significance  had  been  achieved  or  the  FA  was  reached 
(determination of the number of OS events at FA had to occur at IA2). The total event size calculation 
for OS was based on an adaptive sample size reassessment approach.  
PFS was tested at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. OS was tested at the IAs or FA at the significance level 
determined  by  the  O'Brien-Fleming  alpha  spending  function  (the  Lan-DeMets  method).  The  first  IA 
(primary  analysis  for  PFS)  was  planned  to  be  performed  when  approximately  328  PFS  events  had 
occurred or 25 months after the last patient has been enrolled, whichever occurred later. With 328 PFS 
events, it would have had 95% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 (i.e., median PFS of 26 months 
for control versus 39 months for treatment) using a 2-sided log-rank test at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 
and assuming approximately 15% dropout rate at month 30. This IA was expected to occur at 45 months 
after the first patient is enrolled, including a 20-month enrolment period and an additional 25-month 
follow-up after the last patient enrolled. 
The second IA was originally planned to be conducted for OS when approximately 200 death events had 
been  observed,  which  was  expected  to  occur  approximately  60  months  after  the  first  patient  was 
enrolled. Due to regulatory concerns, additional interval IAs for PFS2 and OS were conducted. The test 
significance  for  the  IAs  of  OS  was  determined  using  O’Brien-Fleming  boundaries  (the  Lan-DeMets 
method) with a total of 260 death events. The minimum event size of 260 death events was based on 
an optimistic assumption of a hazard ratio of 0.70 (i.e., median OS of 70 months for control versus 100 
months for treatment) with 80% power at a 2-sided level of significance. 
Health-related QOL was measured by 3 instruments to address secondary and exploratory endpoints: 
•  the  European  Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire-Core Module 30 (QLQ-C30), 
• the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module-20 (QLQ-MY20), and 
• the EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D). 
Scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. High scores for 
the global and functional domains indicate better QOL or functioning, while high scores on the symptom 
scales indicate higher levels of symptomatology or problems.

population;  395  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  ixazomib  and  261  patients  were  randomized  to 
receive  placebo.  As  of  the  DCO  date  for  IA4  (12  October  2022),  all  patients  had  completed  study 
treatment; 50% of the study population was continuing follow-up (see Table below). 
Study outcomes 
Overall survival (OS) 
With  209  deaths  (32%  of  the  ITT  population;  129  [33%]  in  the  ixazomib  arm  and  80  [31%]  in  the 
placebo arm), median OS was not estimable (NE) in both treatment arms (HR=1.074; 95% CI: 0.812, 
1.421; p=0.616). OS results are summarised in Table and Figure below:

At this IA4, 281 of the 394 (71%) patients in the ixazomib arm and 187 of the 259 (72%) patients in 
the  placebo  arm  had  received  subsequent  therapy.  Patients  in  the  ixazomib  arm  started  subsequent 
therapy later than patients in the placebo arm: median time to subsequent therapy, 33.1 months versus 
27.6  months  (HR=0.833;  95%  CI:  0.690,  1.005;  p =  0.056).  Results  from the  prespecified  marginal 
structural models (MSM) and inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) analyses are shown in 
Table below.

After adjusting for subsequent therapy received between the 2 arms, the HRs showed an OS advantage 
with ixazomib over placebo, although the effect was not statistically significant. 
Ad  hoc  sensitivity  analyses  were  also  used  to  investigate  further  the  potential  impact  on  OS  of 
subsequent therapies, which were not specified in the study and were administered at the discretion of 
the  investigator.  Use  of  a  proteasome  inhibitor  (PI)  as  next-line  therapy  was  of  particular  interest. 
Because  the  study  was  blinded,  some  patients  had  next-line  therapy  initiated  without  having  been 
unblinded. Patients in the ixazomib arm who progressed while on ixazomib and were put on a PI as next-
line  therapy  may  have  been  receiving  a  treatment  to  which  their  disease  was  resistant.  In  contrast, 
patients who progressed while on placebo, having had a treatment holiday, may have been more likely 
to have disease that was still sensitive to PIs. 
Among  the  465  patients  who  received  any  subsequent  therapy,  median  OS  was  93.0  months  in  the 
ixazomib arm and NE in the placebo arm (HR=1.123; 95% CI: 0.841, 1.500; p=0.431) (see Table and 
Figure below).

Among the remaining 191 patients who were censored at subsequent therapy, median OS was NE in 
both the ixazomib arm and the placebo arm (HR=0.643; 95% CI 0.192, 2.159; p=0.472) (See Table 
and Figure below).

Among the 465 patients who received subsequent therapy, at second line in particular, 226 received a 
regimen containing a PI and 239 received a regimen that did not contain a PI. 
Patients who received a PI at second line had a median OS of NE in the ixazomib arm and NE in the 
placebo arm (HR=0.899; 95% CI: 0.572, 1.414; p=0.646) (see Table and Figure below).

In contrast, among patients whose second-line therapy did not include a PI, the median OS was reached 
in both arms: 72.3 months in the ixazomib arm and 86.7 months in the placebo arm (HR=1.298; 95% 
CI: 0.877, 1.921; p=0.190) (see Table and Figure below).

Patients with MRD negative (MRD-) status at study entry (N=364) showed a nonsignificant trend toward 
reduced risk of death compared with patients who were known to have MRD positive (MRD+) status at 
study  entry  (N=192)  (HR=0.797,  95%  CI:  0.572,  1.111,  p=0.180).  The  median  OS  was  NE  in  both 
groups (see Table below). 
For patients who were MRD- at study entry, patients in the ixazomib arm showed a nonsignificant trend 
toward reduced risk of death compared with patients in the placebo arm (HR=0.688, 95% CI: 0.397,

For patients who were MRD+ at study entry, patients in the placebo arm showed a nonsignificant trend 
toward reduced risk of death compared with patients in the ixazomib arm (HR=1.105, 95% CI: 0.758,

At  study  entry,  a  total  of  57%  (225  of  395)  of  ixazomib  patients  and  53%  (139  of  261)  of  placebo 
patients were known to be MRD+. Among these MRD+ patients, a higher percentage in the ixazomib 
arm shifted from MRD+ to MRD- status at any time after study entry (11% [24 patients], vs 7% [10 
patients] in the placebo arm). Among the 34 patients whose status changed from MRD+ to MRD- during 
the  study,  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  showed  a  nonsignificant  trend  toward  reduced  risk  of  death 
compared  with  patients  in  the  ixazomib  arm  (HR  =  1.478,  95%  CI:  0.163,  13.416,  p  =  0.727).  The 
median OS was NE in both groups. 
At study entry, a total of 30% (117 of 395) of ixazomib patients and 29% (75 of 261) of placebo patients 
were known to be MRD-. Among these MRD- patients, a higher percentage in the placebo arm shifted 
from MRD- to MRD+ status at any time after study entry (47% [35 patients], vs 34% [40 patients] in

the ixazomib arm). Among the 75 patients whose status changed from MRD- to MRD+ during the study, 
the median OS was 52.2 months in the ixazomib arm and 74.5 months in the placebo arm; patients in 
the placebo arm showed a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk of death compared with patients in 
the ixazomib arm (HR = 1.108, 95% CI: 0.553, 2.220; p = 0.772). 
Subsequent Antineoplastic Therapy 
At  IA4,  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the  ixazomib  arm  (71%)  and  the  placebo  arm  (72%)  had 
started  subsequent  antineoplastic  therapy  (Table  2.m).  Among  patients  who  received  subsequent 
therapy,  the  ixazomib  and  placebo  arms  used  several  classes  of  agents  at  similar  rates,  including 
corticosteroids (91% and 89%), immunomodulatory drugs (88% and 84%), alkylating agents (36% and 
38%),  and  other  classes  (22%  and  24%).  PI  use  was  lower  in  the  ixazomib  arm  (63%)  than  in  the 
placebo arm (72%), and the use of monoclonal antibodies specific to multiple myeloma (MM) therapy 
was higher in the ixazomib arm (44% vs 37%).

PFS2 
PFS2 (defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease 
progression on subsequent line of anticancer therapy or death from any cause, whichever occurs first) 
was another secondary endpoint. The rate of PFS2 events (progression or death) was slightly higher in 
the  ixazomib  arm  (41%)  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (38%),  with  a  median  PFS2  of  81.8  months  in  the 
ixazomib arm and 80.2 months in the placebo arm (HR=1.016; 95% CI: 0.791, 1.305; p=0.898; See

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
For both EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20, overall compliance throughout the follow-up period was high 
(≥72%) in both the ixazomib and placebo arms. As expected, these compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ 
instruments  were  lower  relative  to  those during the treatment period  but  to  a  similar  degree in  each 
arm. EQ-5D compliance rates also had declined during the follow-up periods relative to the treatment 
period (to ≥51%) but again were similar between arms. 
Scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QOL scale were similar with ixazomib maintenance 
and  with  placebo  throughout  the  follow-up  periods,  by  4-week  intervals,  as  analyzed  by  mean  and 
median  scores  during  the  follow-up  periods.  Using  linear  mixed  models,  the  least-squares  mean 
difference between the ixazomib arm and the placebo arm in global health status/QOL from study entry 
over  time  were  generally  small  and  not  statistically  significantly  different  (not  adjusted  for  multiple 
testing). 
The area under the curve approach was used to examine the differential effect of treatment throughout 
the study. Area under the curve analyses for EORTC QLQ-C30 scores showed no detriment to QOL in the 
ixazomib arm compared with the placebo arm up to the 36th 4-week interval. As in previous analyses 
for  this  study,  a  minimal  important  difference  (MID)  threshold  for  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  has  been 
identified as a 10-point improvement for patients with MM. Using this MID threshold, the proportions of 
patients  whose  scores  were  stable  or  improved  by  at  least  10  points  on  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global 
QOL/health status scale during the follow-up periods were similar in the 2 arms. 
In addition to global health status/QOL, health-related QOL was generally maintained in both arms during 
the follow-up period for the physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning domains. Only 
the symptom scores for diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting showed differences between the ixazomib and 
placebo arms at a few time points, with somewhat higher mean change values (indicating slightly greater

symptomatology) reported in the ixazomib arm. 
Results of the EORTC QLQ-MY20 were generally similar between the treatment arms during the follow-
up  periods.  Specifically,  during  the  treatment  and  follow-up  periods,  the  results  of  the  subscale 
measuring side effects of treatment and disease symptoms with treatment were similar in the 2 arms. 
Area under the curve analyses for EORTC QLQ-MY20 scores showed no detriment to QOL in the ixazomib 
arm compared with the placebo arm up to the 36th 4-week interval. 
Results of the EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale, which reflect the patients’ self-reported health status, 
paralleled the global health status/QOL results of the EORTC QLQ-C30. EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale 
scores were consistent during the treatment period and similar between the ixazomib maintenance arm 
and the placebo arm. 
Treatment  with  ixazomib  as  maintenance  therapy  after  SCT  did  not  result  in  the  use  of  additional 
healthcare resources or prolong hospitalizations compared to placebo. Healthcare utilization rates (total 
number  of  events  divided  by  total  number  of  patient-years)  were  similar  in  the  2  arms.  The  rate  of 
hospitalizations per patient-year (0.27 for ixazomib and 0.25 for placebo) and the rate of all outpatient 
visits per patient-year (3.47 for ixazomib and 3.48 for placebo) were similar in the 2 arms. The median 
length of hospitalization per hospital stay among admitted patients was 5.0 and 4.0 days for the ixazomib 
and placebo arms, respectively. Among patients who reported missing days of work, the median number 
of days missed was similar in the ixazomib and placebo arms (29.0 and 28.0 days, respectively). The 
same was true for caregivers, who reported a similar median number of missed days of work in each 
arm  (5.0  days  ixazomib,  6.5  days  placebo).  The  reasons  for  hospitalizations,  emergency  room  visits, 
and outpatient visits were generally similar between the ixazomib and placebo arms, except for, during 
emergency  room  visits,  visits  due  to  procedures  (5%  vs  17%,  respectively)  and  adverse  events 
(AE)/toxicity (78% vs 64%, respectively). The most common reason for healthcare resource utilization 
was as follows: during hospitalizations, AE/toxicity (42% ixazomib and 36% placebo); during emergency 
room visits, AE/toxicity (78% ixazomib and 64% placebo); and during outpatient visits, medication (31% 
ixazomib and 35% placebo). 
6.3.  Discussion 
Methods 
Study C16019 is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase III study aimed at investigating 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ixazomib  monotherapy  as  post  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT) 
maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). Ninlaro is not indicated in this setting in 
the EU, and no extension of the indication based on results from study C16019 is currently planned.  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria in study C16019 adequately defined a population of adult subjects with 
NDMM who had received ASCT as consolidation therapy following successful induction, as per current 
clinical guidelines (see e.g. the Multiple myeloma EHA-ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up, Dimopoulos MA et al, Ann Oncol 2021). The MM population targeted by study 
C16019  was,  therefore,  not  representative  of  the  approved  indication  for  Ninlaro  (i.e.  patients  with 
relapsed  or  refractory  MM  who  has  received  at  least  one  single  prior  line  of  therapy):  in  particular, 
subjects in study C16019 had a limited MM history and were required to have chemosensitive disease 
(e.g.  at  least  a  PR  should  have  been  documented  after  induction/ASCT).  Conversely,  patients  in 
registrational study C16010 were required to have failed at least one prior line of therapy, and refractory 
patients were allowed (e.g. 6% of patients had primary refractory disease, 23% were refractory to any 
prior IMiD, 8% to any prior PI and 11% had relapsed and refractory MM). Overall, this is in line with the 
primary aim of SOB004, which was to further substantiate the clinical activity and safety of Ninlaro in 
different MM settings. On the other hand, limited additional information can be inferred with respect to

the efficacy of Ninlaro in the approved indication: MM is a chronic malignancy, and in the R/R setting 
clinical  benefit  demonstration  mostly  relies  on  the  ability  of  a  new  drug/combination  to  overcome 
chemoresistance, whilst chemosensitivity was a prerequisite in maintenance study C16019.  
Differences between SOB003 study C16019 and registrational study C16010 could also be observed in 
terms of dose regimen: in study C16019 the ixazomib monotherapy starting dose was 3 mg on days 1, 
8 and 15 of 28-day cycles, and ixazomib could be escalated to 4 mg starting from cycle 5 in the case it 
was well tolerated. In study C16010, ixazomib was administered in combination with Len-Dex starting 
with  the  higher  4  mg  dose,  and  dose  reductions  were  only  possible  in  the  case  of  recurrent/severe 
toxicity. The differences in dosing schedules across ixazomib trials reflected the specific aims of post-
ASCT maintenance (e.g. long therapy duration, optimal tolerability etc.) compared to the treatment of 
progressing disease (e.g. overcoming drug resistance, achieving significant cytoreduction etc.). These 
differences,  although  justified,  further  hamper  the  possibility  of  inter-trial  comparisons,  especially  in 
terms of efficacy.  
The choice to conduct a placebo-controlled study was acceptable since, at the time of study initiation, 
no compound was specifically authorised in this indication. ). Lenalidomide is currently approved as post-
ASCT maintenance treatment in the EU, and is the current standard of care in this clinical setting (see 
e.g. the current ESMO guidelines for MM).   
Patients  were  randomised  to  ixazomib  or  placebo  according  to  an  unequal  allocation  ratio  (3:2),  and 
randomisation was stratified according to type of induction therapy (PI only vs IMiD only vs PI plus IMiD), 
ISS  at  diagnosis  (I  vs  II  or  III)  and  response  to  ASCT  (CR/VGPR  vs  PR).  The  potential  prognostic 
relevance of the selected stratification factors is acknowledged.  
PFS based on IRC-assessment was the primary endpoint in study C16019, which is acceptable. MM is, 
in fact, a chronic and, at present, incurable disease, and a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
improvement in terms of disease-progression delay could be considered, per se, a measure of clinical 
benefit, provided that no negative impact on survival and/or quality of life is observed. In this regard, 
OS was the key secondary endpoint in study C16019, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on health-
related quality of life (HR-QoL) were also collected. 
Approximately 652 patients were planned to be randomized to allow for a 80% power for OS testing in 
the ITT population. Two interim analyses (IAs) were originally planned: the first IA was the primary (and 
only)  analysis  for  PFS.  Results  from  the  primary  PFS  analyses  were  submitted  in  variation 
EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G. OS was also tested at this first IA and at subsequent IAs until statistical 
significance  was  achieved  or  Final  Analysis  (FA)  reached.  The  total  event  size  calculation  for  OS  was 
based on an adaptive sample size reassessment approach, with the actual number of OS events expected 
at the FA to be determined after IA2. The significance level for OS was to be determined according to 
the  O'Brien-Fleming  alpha  spending  function  (the  Lan-DeMets  method)  and  the  described  sequential 
testing procedure was employed to control the family-wise type I error for both the primary (PFS) and 
key secondary (OS) endpoint.  
A non statistically significant HR of 1.165 was observed for OS at the time of the PFS IA (see also the 
“Results” section below); both pre-specified (MSM and IPCW) and post-hoc sensitivity analyses to adjust 
for potential confounding by subsequent therapy on OS (e.g. methods, based on censoring “switchers” 
approach and on time-varying Cox model) were provided by the MAH. Although their exploratory nature 
is  recognised,  most  of  these  methods  are  based  on  the  assumption  of  the  absence  of  unmeasured 
confounders: this is a strong assumption in a heterogeneous condition such as MM that, if not satisfied, 
can lead to an unknown amount of systematic error in the estimate. Since the validity of this underlying 
assumption is difficult to verify, the regulatory value of these sensitivity analyses is necessarily limited.

Results  
Results from the PFS IA have been submitted in the context of procedure EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G: 
study C16019 met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant PFS improvement vs. placebo, 
with a median PFS by IRC of 26.5 months with ixazomib compared to 21.3 months with placebo (HR 
0.72; 95%CI 0.58, 0.89; p=0.002). Although the study was formally successful, the clinical relevance 
of the observed PFS improvement was uncertain, especially when the long treatment duration and the 
change in the therapeutic landscape of MM (e.g. the approval of lenalidomide as maintenance option) 
were considered.  
As per study design, OS was also tested at the time of the PFS IA. Immature OS data did not allow, at 
the time, to reasonably exclude a detrimental effect on survival, since the point estimation for the OS 
HR was 1.165 (95%CI 0.761, 1.779). PFS2 data were consistent with OS in showing a potential negative 
impact on the efficacy of subsequent treatments (HR 1.160; 95% CI: 0.810, 1.662; p=0.417). Although 
the  significant  differences  between  study  C16019  and  the  approved  indication  for  Ninlaro  were 
acknowledged,  it  was  noticed  that  both  clinical  settings  were  characterised  by  prolonged  exposure  to 
ixazomib in early stages of MM. Out of caution, the CHMP decided to amend SOB004 in order to provide 
additional  OS/PFS2  data  from  Phase  3  study  C16019  when  approximately  200  death  events  have 
occurred.  The  MAH  specified  that  additional  IAs  were  introduced  in  study  C16019  to  allow  for  earlier 
looks at OS. 
In  the  context  of  annual  renewal  procedures,  updated  PFS2  and  OS  data  from  IA2  and  IA3  were 
submitted  (data  cut-off  dates  [DCOs]  January  2020  and  January  2021,  respectively),  showing  no 
significant change compared to the initial analysis, although the HR for OS became closer to 1.0 (i.e. 
1.029 and 1.008 at the time of IA2 and IA3, respectively). 
In compliance with the agreed timeframe, the MAH has submitted updated data from the planned IA4 
(DCO October 2022), after 209 deaths had been reported in study C16019 (32% of the ITT population). 
At the time of IA4, no subject was still ongoing on treatment, yet 50% of patients were still continuing 
in follow-up. Death events were evenly distributed across study arms (33% in the ixazomib and 31% in 
the placebo arm, respectively) and, with the majority of patients still alive, median OS was not reached 
in both treatment arms. The OS HR (1.074, 95%CI 0.812, 1.421), although reduced compared to IA2, 
still slightly favoured placebo, yet the KM curves for OS run largely superimposed, repeatedly crossing 
over time, and hardly show any clear superiority trend of one arm over the other. 
To  further  characterised  OS  data,  the  MAH  has  provided  several  pre-specified  and  ad  hoc  sensitivity 
analyses. A similar proportion of subjects (~70%) received subsequent treatments in both study arms, 
although,  consistently  with  PFS  data,  the  median  time  to  next  treatment  was  slightly  longer  in  the 
ixazomib  arm  (33.1  vs.  27.6  months  in  the  experimental  and  placebo  arms,  respectively;  HR  0.833, 
95%CI  0.690,  1.005).  The  pre-specified  MSM  and  IPCW  showed  that,  after  adjusting  for  subsequent 
therapy, the HR (0.760 and 0.644, respectively) favoured the ixazomib arm, although the effect was not 
statistically significant. The limits of these methods have been, however, already discussed. 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis stratified by subsequent therapy status showed that in the subgroup of 
patients  who  were  censored  at  subsequent  therapy  (n=191)  a  “protective”  HR  point  estimation  was 
observed (i.e. 0.643, 95%CI 0.192, 2.159). Conversely, in the subgroup of patients who received any 
subsequent  therapy  (n=465)  the  HR  was  1.123  (95%CI  0.841,  1.500),  hinting  that  response  to 
subsequent therapy  could  play  a  role in explaining the lack  of  significant  survival  benefit  observed in 
study  C16019.  No  significant  differences  in  the  choice  of  subsequent  treatments  could  be,  however, 
observed  across  study  arms,  with  the  exception  that  more  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  received 
subsequent PIs compared to the ixazomib arm (72% vs. 63%). Since study C16019 was double-blinded

and a number of subjects in the ixazomib arm were not unblinded at the time subsequent treatment 
lines  were 
started, 
the  MAH 
has 
previously 
hypothesized 
(see 
e.g. 
procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G) that lack of unblinding could have resulted in a higher risk for patients in 
the active arm to receive suboptimal subsequent treatment (e.g. exposure to other PIs). However, an 
additional analysis exploring the impact of exposure to PI as subsequent line of therapy showed that the 
HR in subjects who received a subsequent PI (n=226) was 0.899 (95%CI 0.572, 1.414) compared to 
1.298 (95%CI 0.877, 1.921) in subjects whose subsequent line of therapy did not include a PI (n=239). 
This  finding is  apparently counterintuitive,  since  ixazomib  is  a  “second-generation”  PI,  and  prolonged 
exposure  to  ixazomib  in  study  C16019  would  be  expected  to  result  in  increased  resistance  to  PIs.  It 
should be  considered, however,  that  subsequent treatment lines  were not  specified in  study  C16019, 
nor the criteria and timing to start a new active treatment, therefore the results of these post-hoc, non-
randomised analyses should be interpreted with caution, since the risk of bias is high. In this regard, KM 
plots for OS stratified by exposure to a subsequent PI are of difficult interpretations, with curves running 
superimposed for long intervals and crossing multiple times.  
Results from the updated PFS2 analysis showed that median PFS2 was slightly longer in the ixazomib 
(81.8 months) arm compared to placebo (80.2 months), yet more events were reported in the ixazomib 
(41%) compared to the placebo arm (38%), resulting in a HR of 1.016 (95%CI 0.791, 1.305). Again, 
KM  plots  for  PFS2  were  of  difficult  interpretation  because  of  extensive  superimposition  and  multiple 
crossings. 
Updated subgroup analyses for OS were also provided. Although results were usually consistent across 
subgroups, some counterintuitive trends could be observed, such as the reduced effect in subjects with 
post-transplant suboptimal response (i.e. subjects who achieved a best response of PR with ASCT, who 
could theoretically have benefited more of additional treatment, especially since post-ASCT consolidation 
cycles were not allowed in study C16019). Similarly, patients with persistent post-ASCT MRD positivity 
apparently  fared  better  with  placebo  compared  to ixazomib  (HR  for  OS  1.105,  95%CI  0.758,  1.610), 
despite an increased number of MRD+ patients shifted to MRD- status with ixazomib (11%) compared 
to  placebo  (7%),  and  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  who  received  placebo  (47%)  lost  their  MRD 
negativity  status  compared  to  patients  who  received  ixazomib  (34%).  The  interpretation  of  MRD 
subgroup KM curves for OS was also not straightforward, with curves crossing repeatedly. Finally, the 
rationale for the divergent treatment effect trend reported for subjects with R-ISS stage I and R-ISS 
stage II was also of uncertain explanation.     
PRO data were also provided to explore the impact of long-term ixazomib exposure in terms of HR-QoL. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 score trends in global health status/QoL from study entry over time were generally 
similar across study arms, and AUC and MID (using a 10-point meaningful difference) analyses also did 
not capture significant detrimental effects with ixazomib compared to placebo. HR-QoL score trends were 
also  consistent  across  most  domains,  with  the  exception  of  the  symptom  scores  for  diarrhoea  and 
nausea/vomiting, in which higher mean change values could be observed in the ixazomib arm. This is 
not unexpected, since both diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting are already reported as very common ADRs 
with ixazomib.  
Results with the QLQ-MY20 and EQ-5D tools were generally consistent with the EORTC QLQ-C30 analysis. 
The analysis of the use of healthcare resources did not show a significant increase in hospitalisation rates 
and times with ixazomib.

7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Subsequent  to  the  24-month  active  treatment  period  or  removal  from  study  therapy  due  to  disease 
progression or toxicity, patients were to be followed for disease status, subsequent therapies, health-
related quality of life, NPM, and OS. 
As of the primary analysis for Study C16019 (conducted at IA1; DCO date 16 April 2018), all patients 
had completed treatment. As such, data from that analysis represented the final safety analysis for Study 
C16019  (please,  see  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003844/II/0014/G  for  additional  details).  The  safety 
population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of ixazomib or placebo. Since the primary 
analysis, the only safety data collected have been reports of NPM received during the follow-up period. 
7.2.  Results 
Extent of Exposure 
A total of 656 patients comprise the intent-to-treat (ITT) population in Study C16019: 395 patients who 
received ixazomib and 261 who received placebo (due to the 3:2 randomization ratio in the study). A 
total  of  653  patients  comprise  the  safety  population  in  Study  C16019:  394  patients  who  received 
ixazomib and 259 who received placebo. 
Disposition 
As of the DCO date for IA4 (12 October 2022), 50% of the study population was continuing follow-up. 
All patients had completed study treatment at the time of the primary analysis (see Table below). 
Adverse Events 
All patients were off study treatment as of IA1; there was only 1 on-study death reported (a patient in 
the  ixazomib  arm  who  died  of  pneumonia).  The  only  safety  parameter  that  was  collected  during  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/457224/2023

patient follow-up period was NPM, which is an AESI for ixazomib.  
Adverse Event of Special Interest - NPM 
A blinded review of the disease type and NPM Preferred Term was conducted by the MAH medical monitor 
in order to distinguish whether an event was an NPM, progression of the underlying multiple myeloma 
(MM),  or  progression  of  a  previously  diagnosed  malignancy.  The  occurrence  of  second  malignancies, 
herein called NPMs, is a known risk in patients with MM. Note that NPMs were assessed while patients 
were  on  treatment  (up  to  30  days  after  last  dose  of  ixazomib  or  placebo)  and  during  their  follow-up 
participation once study drug had been discontinued. 
Data  for  on-treatment  NPM  were  reported  at  IA1,  by  which  time  all  patients  had  completed  study 
therapy.  As  of  IA4,  there  are  updated  follow-up  NPM  data.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  NPMs  (on 
treatment and during follow-up) in the ixazomib and placebo arms was similar (7% and 8%, respectively; 
see Table below). The incidence of NPMs by disease type was similar in the ixazomib and placebo arms. 
The most common category of follow-up NPM was hematological malignancy (2% in ixazomib arm, 3% 
in placebo arm).

There was no increased risk of NPM with ixazomib maintenance therapy. No safety concerns have been 
identified with regard to NPMs as of IA4 (median follow-up of approximately 7 years). Patients with NPM 
continue to be monitored as needed. 
7.3.  Discussion 
No  patient  was  still  receiving  ixazomib  at  the  time of  IA4  and,  as  per  study  protocol,  only  reports  of 
NPMs were collected in the follow-up period of study C16019. 
Overall, a similar incidence of NPMs was observed across study arms (7% and 8% in the ixazomib and 
placebo  arms,  respectively),  and  no  clear  pattern  in  type  and  time  of  incidence  could  be  identified. 
Second haematological malignancies were the most common form of NPM in both study arms (2% and 
3%  with  ixazomib  and  placebo,  respectively),  with  the  exception  of  skin  tumours  (3%  and  2%  with 
ixazomib and placebo, respectively). 
No new relevant safety information was available from study C16019.

Overall, the available safety data from study C16019 are not suggestive of a significant increase in the 
risk of NPMs with prolonged exposure to ixazomib. The safety profile of Ninlaro is, therefore, unchanged.

9.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation the SmPC is being updated to medicines subject to remove the black triangle 
of additional monitoring. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
to the PI and update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Changes are also made to the Opinion Annex II conditions as detailed in the recommendations section 
above. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
10.1.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(3)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Ninlaro  (ixazomib)  is  removed  from  the 
additional monitoring list as five years have passed after the URD and all the specific obligations have 
been fulfilled.  
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will 
allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, 
is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

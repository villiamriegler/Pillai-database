The warning related to immunogenicity has been updated 
to update warning on immunogenicity. The RMP 
version 10.1 has also been submitted. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor 
editorial changes to the PI. Annex IID is also updated 
to include the key elements related to 
Annex II 
to include the latest information on alglucosidase alfa 
immunogenicity profile and anti-drug antibodies testing 
recommendations based on clinical trial and literature data. 
In addition, based on this updated review, there was 
limited evidence that IgG antibodies to alglucosidase alfa 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

studies evaluating motor and respiratory functions of LOPD 
trials and from other analyses of late-onset Pompe 
and PL 
patients treated by ERT and one observational study 
disease patients treated with Myozyme. The Package 
Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9.0. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to

LOPD. These new observational data present a clinically 
relevant efficacy trend in the treatment effect of Myozyme 
on overall survival, motor functions and respiratory status 
in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. The CHMP 
considered this information to be of importance to the 
prescriber and an update of section 5.1 and consequently 
that of section 4.1 is warranted. The benefit/risk of 
Myozyme remains unchanged. Please refer to the scientific

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH has submitted an analysis of post-marketing 
ADRs 'nephrotic syndrome', 'proteinuria', 'stridor' 
II, Labelling 
cases of nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria (from the 
and 'vasoconstriction', and section 4.4 of the SmPC 
and PL 
International Birth Date, 29 March 2006 to March 2011), 
to amend the existing warning related to 'nephrotic 
syndrome'. The Package Leaflet has been amended 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the RMP version number in 
annex II to reflect the latest version agreed with 
CHMP (version 6), to make editorial changes to the 
annexes and to update the contact details in the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
and stridor and vasoconstriction (from 29 March 2006 to 28 
June 2011). 
Reports of immune-mediated reactions in patients treated 
with Myozyme remain "uncommon" (<1/100; ≥1/1000). 
Cases suggestive of immune-mediated reactions included 
reports of nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, haematuria, 
skin lesion, skin necrosis, arthralgia, myalgia, arthropathy, 
lymphadenopathy, serum sickness, and type III immune 
complex mediated reaction. 
Proteinuria was observed in 5 patients, 3 of whom 
developed nephrotic syndrome associated with high 
Page 18/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody titres (≥ 102,400). Among the patients with 
nephritic syndrome, 1 was male and 2 were female; 1 was 
an infant and 2 were adults. Renal biopsy in these 3 
patients stained positive with rhGAA antibody consistent 
with immune complex deposition, thus confirming the 
previously recognized potential risk of immune-mediated 
reactions to be an identified risk. As further support 
identifying nephrotic syndrome as a risk of treatment with 
alglucosidase alfa, all 3 patients improved following 
treatment interruption. 
From the International Birth Date of 29 March 2006 
through 28 June 2011, cumulatively 3 patients experienced 
stridor in addition to other IARs that occurred during 
infusion. The events resolved in all cases upon infusion 
interruption, administration of corticosteroids and or 
administration of epinephrine. 
One patient with a report of vasoconstriction was identified 
with concomitant IARs of abdominal pain, asystole, 
bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, extensive erythema, 
gastroenteritis and oedema. Infusion reactions were 
managed with infusion schedule adjustments, 
premedications, slower rates and preparation of the 
infusion from a different batch.  
Based on the data provided, the CHMP agreed with the 
proposed inclusion of the ADRs ‘nephrotic syndrome’, 
‘proteinuria’, ‘stridor’, ‘vasoconstriction’ and related safety 
information in Sections 4.4, 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, and relevant sections of the Package 
Leaflet. The Risk Management Plan and the Myozyme 
Safety Package have been updated in line with these

the effect of the product on pregnant animals. The results 
have been reflected in the SPC section 4.6 on "Pregnancy 
and Lactation" regarding reproductive toxicity in animals. 
The wording is a follows: 
"Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of alglucosidase alfa in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. Myozyme should not be used 
during pregnancy unless clearly necessary." 
Section 5.3 on "Preclinical safety data" regarding the 
results of the early embryonic and embryofoetal 
development in mice and rabbits was also amended. 
Treatment related cases of abortion in animals when 
coadministered with diphenhydramine were also reported.  
In the Package Leaflet the information to stop breast-
feeding while taking the product was added. 
The final wording is as follows: 
"5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based 
on studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeat dose 
toxicity. No significant adverse findings on embryofoetal 
development were observed in a mouse and a rabbit 
embryofoetal study and no significant adverse findings 
were observed in a mouse fertility and early embryonic 
development study. In the rabbit embryofoetal 
development study, following administration of Myozyme

(10-40 mg/kg/day) with coadministration of 
diphenhydramine, a treatment-related increase in the 
incidence of abortions and early delivery was observed. 
This effect was partly attributable to maternal toxicity, as a 
significant decrease in feed consumption and body weight 
gain was observed. "

4 cases of serious infusion adverse reactions (IARs) were 
and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC) as a consequence of  reports of serious cases 
of anaphylaxia. Corresponding sections of the 
Package Leaflet (PL) have been updated accordingly. 
In addition, minor changes were included in the list 
of local representatives. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
reported in March and April 2006 with Myozyme: 
· 
2 cases of serious IARs in late-onset patients (one 
angioedema, severe; and one anaphylactoid reaction, 
severe), and both have been withdrawn from their ongoing 
study; 
· 
as well as 2 cases of serious IARs in infantile-onset 
patients (both with anaphylaxis, one life-threatening and 
the other, moderate), and both will probably continue with 
their treatment due to the life-threatening nature of their 
disease.  
None of these events was due to an inappropriate infusion 
rate or dose.  
During the clinical trials, 4 female patients experienced 
serious oedema-IARs while receiving  
20 mg/kg Myozyme. Three of the 4 patients had late-onset 
Pompe disease with a mean age at time of IAR occurrence 
of 33.3 years (age range 29 to 39 years). The remaining 
patient was a 25-month-old with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease. Events of oedema by MedDRA preferred term 
included periorbital oedema, swollen tongue, face oedema, 
and oedema peripheral (1 patient each). The time of onset 
was either during the infusion (2 cases) or 1.5 and 2 h 
following completion of the injection (2 cases). All patients 
continued to receive Myozyme, either at lower doses and/or 
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with premedication, with either no reaction or reduced 
intensity reactions. 
There had also been 1 case of oedema-IAR with Pharming 
rhGAA 10 mg/kg in a late-onset Pompe disease patient. 
In addition, previous to the granting of the MA, there were 
4 cases of serious anaphylactic/anaphylactoid-IARs with 
bronchospasm, decreased oxygen saturation and/or 
hypotension. All 4 patients were females with infantile-
onset Pompe disease receiving Myozyme at a dose of 20 
mg/kg QOW. At time of IAR occurrence, mean age of 
patients was 13 months (age range 5 to 25 months). All 
patients continued to receive Myozyme, except one.  
Myozyme is contra-indicated in patients with a 
hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active 
substance or

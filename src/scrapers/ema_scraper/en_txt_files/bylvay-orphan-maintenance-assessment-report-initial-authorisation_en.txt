2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2012 designation was 
based on the following grounds:  
Whereas, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), having examined the application, 
concluded:  
• 
• 
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to be affecting not more than 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time 
the application was made; the sponsor has based this on a literature search; this is not more than 
5 in 10,000 persons as established in Article 3(1) (a) of Regulation (EC) 141/2000;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms which develop early, median time at onset 
of symptoms being 2 months with 78% of patients developing jaundice. The natural history and 
complications of hepatic dysfunction (portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular 
carcinoma) are associated with the condition. Portal hypertension can develop. The condition is 
life-threatening due to death secondary to complications of end-stage liver disease. In general, 
without treatment, PFIC will lead to cirrhosis by age 10-20 years, and frequently even earlier. The 
survival in those not coming to surgery is 50% at the age of 10 and almost none at the age of 20 
years;  
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP recommends the designation of this medicinal product, containing (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-[({[3,3-
dibutyl-7-(methylthio)-1,1-dioxido-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8- 
yl]oxy}acetyl)amino]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}butanoic acid, as an orphan medicinal product 
for the orphan indication: treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis continues to be an orphan 
condition.  
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a heterogeneous group of rare autosomal 
recessive liver disorders of childhood characterized by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved 
in the hepatocellular transport system. 
Three main subtypes of PFIC (PFIC1, PFIC2, PFIC3) have been identified. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000048989 
Page 4/10 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
PFIC1, also known as Byler’s disease, is caused by mutations in the ATPase phospholipid 
transporting 8B1 gene (ATP8B1), located on chromosome 18, which encodes a phospholipid 
transporting transmembrane P-type adenosine triphosphatase known as FIC1. This ‘flippase’ is 
involved in maintaining an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the canalicular 
membrane bilayer of hepatocytes, thereby protecting the canalicular membrane from hydrophobic 
bile acids and maintaining its integrity.  
• 
• 
PFIC2 is caused by mutations in the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member11 gene (ABCB11), 
located on chromosome 2, which encodes the bile salt export pump (BSEP), the main transporter 
of bile acids from hepatocytes to the canalicular lumen.  
PFIC3 is caused by mutations in the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 gene (ABCB4), 
located on chromosome 7, which encodes multidrug-resistance protein 3 (MDR3/ABCB4); this 
protein transports phospholipids into the canalicular lumen to neutralize bile salts and prevent 
injury to biliary epithelia and bile canaliculi. 
In addition, at least 3 other subtypes have been described in the literature (PFIC4-6).  
The main clinical features of PFIC include cholestasis, jaundice and pruritus, with symptoms typically 
appearing in infancy or early childhood. PFIC is associated with a range of potentially fatal 
complications of the liver, including portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC; PFIC2), as well as extrahepatic manifestations (PFIC1). The biochemical features of 
PFIC1 and PFIC2 are low levels of γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) with elevated serum bile acid and 
decreased primary bile acid concentrations, while PFIC3 is associated with high levels of GGT. 
Historically, diagnosis of PFIC has been based on a combination of clinical and laboratory or 
biochemical approaches but, more recently, genetic testing has become available (Clinics and Research 
in Hepatology and Gastroenterology (2019) 43, 20—36). 
The COMP continues to designate this condition as an orphan condition.  
The current proposed therapeutic indication “Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of progressive 
familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of progressive familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by a positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Symptoms of the disease develop early, median time of onset of symptoms being 2 months and 78% 
of PFIC patients develop jaundice. Icterus (itching) is often seriously debilitating and could lead to 
auto-mutilation of the skin, irritability and sleeplessness.  Several complications of hepatic dysfunction 
(portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis) and hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with the 
condition. Due to malabsorption of fat and in fat soluble vitamins, young patients commonly show 
signs of “failure to thrive”.  
PFIC can lead to death secondary to complications of end-stage liver disease. In general, without 
treatment, PFIC 1 and 3 will lead to end-stage liver disease by age 10-20 years, and even earlier in 
PFIC 2. The survival in those not coming to surgery is 50% at the age of 10 and almost none at the 
age of 20 years. The rates of liver transplant (LT) for patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 (40—100%)

suggest that the highest reported mortality figure (87%) is probably most representative of the natural 
history of untreated PFIC. 
Reasons for death included infections, bleeding (cerebral, gastrointestinal, splenic), liver failure, liver 
transplant-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, and complications secondary to cholestasis, 
including acute infections, dehydration and gastrointestinal bleeding (Clinics and Research in 
Hepatology and Gastroenterology (2019) 43, 20—36). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided an updated bibliographical search and used 5 publications for the purpose of 
establishing a prevalence estimate. The table below summarises four of the key publications. The fifth 
is a recent review publication by Baker et al from 2019.

Ruth, 2014 
World-wide  9.0% of cases of intrahepatic cholestasis were diagnosed as PFIC 
Two publications reported population-level epidemiology data for PFIC (Henriksen, 1981; Nielsen, 
2004). A retrospective study assessed 124 infants admitted to hospitals in Norway with cholestatic 
jaundice during the first 3 months of life between 1955 and 1974, of whom 60 had intrahepatic 
cholestasis. These figures result in an incidence of intrahepatic cholestasis, including but not limited to 
PFIC, of approximately 1 per 18,000 live births (Henriksen, 1981). However, molecular genetic 
diagnostics for PFIC were not available at the time of data collection (1955—1974). A later study that 
analysed death registers and case records from two hospitals in Greenland for the period 1943—2002 
reported 46 cases of PFIC1 diagnosed by liver biopsy, biochemistry and/or molecular genetic testing 
(ATP8B1) (Nielsen, 2004). In this study, many cases occurred in patients originating from indigenous 
populations described by the authors as ‘‘highly inbred’’. The overall study population size and 
incidence were not reported.  
The other two publications reported the prevalence of PFIC among patients with liver-related disease 
(Fischler, 2001; Ruth, 2014), based on genetic testing for PFIC diagnosis. 
The Swedish study (Fischler, 2001) was a tertiary referral centre study that included infants with 
neonatal cholestasis with an onset in the first 6 months of life. The proportion of cases of PFIC among 
this study population was 12.9%. 
The worldwide multicentre study included infants with cholestasis, acute liver failure or splenomegaly 
(Ruth, 2014). In this study the proportions of intrahepatic cholestasis cases which were PFIC was 
9.0%. 
Baker et al 2019 (Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology (2019) 43, 20—36) offers 
a more extensive epidemiological overview. The table from the publication is presented below:

Six publications reported the prevalence of PFIC among patients with liver-related disease (Table 1). Of 
these, three studies used genetic testing for PFIC diagnosis: a multicentre study from North America in 
children with intrahepatic cholestasis, a Swedish tertiary referral centre study that included infants with 
neonatal cholestasis with an onset in the first 6 months of life, and a worldwide multicentre study in 
infants with cholestasis, acute liver failure or splenomegaly. In these three studies, the proportions of 
cases of PFIC among the study populations were 11.7% (North America), 12.9% (Sweden), and 
9.0%(International), respectively. 
In the remaining three studies the basis of PFIC diagnosis was either clinical, biochemical and 
histological, or was not reported. The other European Centers (Germany, France, Belgium and The 
Netherlands) do not report the percentage of PFIC cases for intrahepatic cholestasis cases. From the 
international study it is apparent that an average range around the world is ~9% for which PFIC will be 
diagnosed. It also appears that there is variability in the prevalence in Europe.  
Altogether, the incidence referenced in the literature review by Baker et al (Baker 2019) and also 
published by Jacquemin 2012, results in a birth incidence for PFIC of 0.13/10 000 (approximately 1 per 
75,000 live births). A birth incidence of 0.13/10 000 gives a total of (4.2 million babies born in the EU 
in 2019; https://ec.europa .eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics) = 56 PFIC 
patients born/year, corresponding to a yearly birth incidence of 0.001/10 000 (56/(519 
200 000x10 000)).   
Taking into account that most liver transplants occur in childhood, a conservative average life span of 
30 years for patients with PFIC is estimated. Based on this, the prevalence can be calculated as follows 
using the incidence x duration formula: 0.001/10 000 x 30 years = 0.03/10 000.  
This was accepted by the COMP. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has national marketing approval for PFIC subtype 3 in France.  
The EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines (2009) recommends UDCA for PFIC 3 and biliary diversion 
surgery (Management of cholestatic liver diseases Journal of Hepatology 51 (2009) 237–267). There 
has been no recent update of the EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
There is currently no medicinal product approved which covers the full PFIC population. 
Supplementation with medium chain triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins is generally recommended 
in children. UDCA has been reported to improve biochemical tests in almost 50% of patients with 
PFIC3, but generally does not affect PFIC1 and PFIC2 although it is widely prescribed off-label. In fact, 
80% of the PFIC 1 or 2 patients in the Bylvay trials had been treated with UDCA.  Rifampicin may 
alleviate pruritus, but it is also use if off-label in PFIC.  
Partial biliary diversion reduces serum bile acids and pruritus and prevent hepatic fibrosis. However, 
the external stoma may lead to complications, such as cholangitis. Effects of this surgery have been 
reported to be temporary. Liver transplantation is the recommended treatment of end-stage liver

disease in PFIC. Liver transplantation requires extensive surgery, and life-long immune-suppression 
thereafter to counterfeit rejection reaction. There is also a shortage of suitable donors.  
As the agreed therapeutic indication of Bylvay is broader and covers more patients, including patients 
with PFIC 1 and 2, than the approved UDCA, there are no satisfactory methods to treat the entirety of 
patients.

4.  COMP position adopted on 21 May 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.03 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms which develop early, median age of onset 
of symptoms being 2 months with 78% of patients developing jaundice. The complications of 
hepatic dysfunction (portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) are 
associated with the condition. It is life-threatening due to death secondary to complications of end-
stage liver disease. In general, without treatment, PFIC will lead to cirrhosis by age 10-20 years, 
and frequently even earlier. The survival in those not coming to surgery is 50% at the age of 10 
and almost none at the age of 20 years; 
at present no satisfactory method has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of 
the entirety of patients covered by the therapeutic indication of Bylvay. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Bylvay, (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-
[({[3,3-dibutyl-7-(methylthio)-1,1-dioxido-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8-
yl]oxy}acetyl)amino]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}butanoic acid, odevixibat, for treatment of 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (EU/3/12/1028) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

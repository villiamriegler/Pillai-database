Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Isentress 
raltegravir 
On 18 May 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Isentress. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. 
The CHMP recommended the approval of a new strength: Isentress 600 mg film-coated tablets, which will 
allow for a once-a-day regimen consisting of two tablets. The currently authorised formulations are taken 
twice a day. 
The indication of Isentress 600 mg film-coated tablet will be as follows:  
“Isentress 600 mg film coated tablets is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) infection in adults, and paediatric 
patients weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

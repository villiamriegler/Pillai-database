1.  Introduction 
On  25  September  2014,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  clinical  study  report  CSLCT-BIO-09-64  for 
Voncento, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Voncento  contains  human  coagulant  FVIII/von  Willebrand  factor  complex  concentrate  at  a  ratio  of 
approximately 1:2.4 (100 IU/mL FVIII:C and approximately 240 IU/mL VWF:RCo). 
Since  12  August  2013,  Biostate  has  been  licensed  in  the  European  Union  under  the  trade  name 
Voncento®  for  the  treatment  of  hemorrhage  or  prevention  and  treatment  of  surgical  bleeding  in 
patients with VWD, when DDAVP treatment alone is ineffective or contra-indicated, and for prophylaxis 
and treatment of bleeding events in patients with hemophilia A. 
Regarding  the  paediatric  use  of  Voncento  in  the  paediatric  population  the  SPC  text  (dd  12-08-2013) 
makes notice of the following: 
- 4.2: 
Paediatric population:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Dosing in VWD and haemophilia A in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old is based on body weight and 
is  therefore  generally  based  on  the  same  guidelines  as  for  adults.  The  frequency  of  administration 
should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  children  <  12  years  have  not  been  established.  No  data  are 
available. 
- 4.8:  
Paediatric Population: 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. 
At the time of this Assessment,  a procedure was ongoing in which data from pediatric study CSL-CT-
08-52 was beingassessed, this involved 17 children with VWD. As part of this procedure an SPC update 
regarding the posology in children will becarried out. 
This  study  was  designed  to  comply  with  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the  clinical  investigation  of  human 
plasma-derived  VWF  products  [CPMP/BPWG/220/02]  the  guideline  on  the  Core  SmPC  for  human 
plasma  derived  VWF  [CPMP/BPWG/278/02]  and  Regulation  (EC)  no  1901/2006  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the council of 12/Dec/2006 on medicinal products for  paediatric use and amending 
Regulation  (EEC)  No  1768/92,  Directive  2001/20/EC,  Directive  2001/83/EC,  and  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004. In addition, the study was designed  to comply with the  guideline  on the role  of  PK  in the 
development  of  medicinal  products  in  the  pediatric  population    EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004]  and 
the  note  for  guidance  on  clinical  investigation  of    medicinal  products  in  the  paediatric  population 
[CPMP/ICH/2711/99].  This  study  was  subject  to  the  Paediatric  Investigational  Plan  (PIP)  evaluation 
(EMEA-000312-PIP01-08).

This assessment report solely focusses on the paediatric data from the extension study CSLCT-BIO-08-
64 (extension of CSLCT-BIO-08-52 or CSLCT-BIO-08-54).   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  MAH  states  that  the  formulation  of  the  study  drug  administered  was  similar  to  that  licensed  for 
commercial use.  
Assessor’s comment 
Some  parts  of  the  documentation  submitted  by  the  MAH  the  investigational  medicinal  product  is 
addressed as ‘Biostate’. Throughout this assessment report Biostate is referred to as Voncento, since in 
the EU the trade name Voncento is applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Clinical study CSLCT-BIO-09-64 
Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study of which: 
- 3 children (<12 years) 
- 2 adolescents (12- <18 years) 
- 15 adults (≥18years) 
The  study  was  a  open-label  study  to  investigate  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  Voncento  in 
children,  adolescents  and  adults  with  Von  Willebrand  disease  (VWD)  in  whom  treatment  with  a  VWF 
product is required for prophylactic therapy,  haemostatic control during surgery,  or  control of  a non-
surgical, spontaneous, or traumatic bleeding event.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study

BIO-08-54  (“Assessment  of  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Voncento  in  Adolescent  or  Adult  Subjects  with 
VWD”). Visit 1 (Day 1) of this study coincided with the Final Visit of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 or study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives:  
 
To assess the effectiveness of a prophylaxis regimen as compared to on-demand therapy with 
Voncento in preventing non-surgical bleeding (NSB) events. 
 
To  assess  the  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  subjects  with  (VWD)  who  require  a  (VWF) 
product to control an NSB event. 
Secondary objectives: 
 
 
To collect long-term data on the safety of Voncento both as on-demand therapy to treat NSB 
events and as prophylactic therapy. 
To  collect  long-term  data  on  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  for  subjects  who  undergo 
surgical procedures during the study period. 
Study design 
Open-label study to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of Voncento in children, adolescents, 
and adults with von Willebrand disease (VWD) in whom treatment with a von Willebrand factor (VWF) 
product is required for prophylactic therapy, haemostatic control  during surgery,  or  control of a non-
surgical, spontaneous, or traumatic bleeding event. 
Study population /Sample size 
This  is  an  open-label  extension  study  without  a  comparator  group  and  with  enrolment    restricted  to 
subjects  completing  either  of  two  prior  studies  (studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  or  CSLCT-BIO-08-54); 
therefore  no  sample  size  estimate  is  warranted.  The  MAH  expected  to  include  approximately  26 
subjects in this extension study, 20 subjects actually enrolled.  
Treatments 
Voncento was administered intravenously as a bolus dose at a maximum infusion rate of 6 mL/min as 
tolerated  by  the  subject.  The  dosage  and  treatment  rationale  was  based  on  the  Core  SmPC  for 
haemophilia A and VWD [CPMP/BPWG/1619/1999; CPMP/BPWG/278/02], as well as the data collected 
from previous efficacy clinical studies which have been conducted with Voncento in both haemophilia A 
and VWD subjects. The doses for spontaneous bleeding events and for surgical events were similar to 
the  recommendations  of  Mannucci  [2004],  and  were  in  accordance  with  international  practice.  Each 
subject’s  individual  dose  was  determined  by  the  investigator,  based  on  the  reason  for  use  (ie,  as 
prophylaxis, to treat a major bleeding, provide prophylaxis for surgery, etc.) ( 
Table 1).

Table 1 Guideline for dosage 
The study contained 3 study-arms: 
• Prophylaxis arm (Arm 1): Subjects who were being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF 
product  at  the  time  of  study  entry,  or  who  were  not  on  a  set  prophylaxis  regimen  but  in  whom 
prophylaxis treatment was justifiable in the opinion of the investigator, were enrolled into Arm 1 and 
received Voncento as part of a prophylaxis regimen as determined by the severity of their disease for a 
period of 12 months. Arm 1 subjects completed the study with a Final Visit at Month 12. 
• On-demand arm (Arm 2): Subjects who were not being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a 
VWF  product  at  the  time  of  study  entry,  and  who  required  a  VWF  product  for  the  treatment  of  NSB 
events (spontaneous or trauma-induced), were enrolled into Arm 2 and commenced using Voncento as 
on-demand therapy for the treatment of NSB events. 
• Arm 3: Subjects, who completed on-demand treatment in Arm 2 and  who qualified to be switched to 
a  set  prophylactic  regimen  according  to  the  pre-specified  criteria  given  below,  entered  Arm  3  and 
started  Voncento  treatment  as  prophylaxis  therapy  for  an  additional  12  months.  The  set  prophylaxis 
regimen was only to be commenced if the investigator believed that it was clinically justifiable for the 
subject, and was determined by the extent and location of NSB events during the preceding 12-month 
on-demand therapy period.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints included: 
• Hemostatic Efficacy: Assessment of hemostatic efficacy by the subject and investigator will use the 
grading scale of Excellent, Good, Moderate, None. 
o  At  Time  of  NSB  Event:  Where  applicable,  subject  and/or  investigator  assessment  of 
hemostatic efficacy at the time of each NSB event. 
o Retrospective Subject Review: Subjects will perform a monthly retrospective self-assessment 
of hemostatic efficacy. 
o  Retrospective  Investigator  Review:  Investigator  assessment  of  hemostatic  efficacy  will  be 
performed retrospectively at the visit occurring every third month. 
• Any blood product transfusion requirements, and the number of treatments/units required to resolve 
any bleeding event. 
•  VWF:RCo/FVIII:C  concentrates  usage:  number  of  infusions,  IU/kg  per  dose,  per  event,  per  month, 
and per year. 
• Assessment of blood loss during any surgical procedure using the grading scale of Less, Equivalent, 
More. 
•  An  assessment  of  the  number  of  spontaneous  or  traumatic  NSB  events  on  a  monthly  basis  and 
overall. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: No formal statistical tests were performed. Efficacy variables were summarised by treatment 
arm  and  overall.  Continuous  variables  were  summarised  using  descriptive  statistics  (number  of  non-
missing values, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and 
maximum). Numbers and percentages are presented in frequency tables for categorical variables. 
Safety: Voncento doses were summarised using descriptive statistics

Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were retrieved form the previous studies (CSCT-BIO-08-52 and CSCT-BIO-08-
54)  as  these  data  were  not  captured  in  the  extension  study.  The  baseline  was  defined  as  either  the 
assessment on the final visit of the previous study or the assessment made at day 1 of this extension 
study. 
The majority of the subjects in the prophylaxis arm were male (8 subjects), while the majority in the 
on-demand arm were female (5 subjects). 
 All 3 participating children (2 age 6 years, 1 age 9 years) were in the prophylaxis arm, mean age of all 
subjects in this arm 35.8 years. In the on-demand arm the mean age was 29,7 years. 2 subjects in on-
demand and prophylaxis arm were male, age 16 and 40. One additional adolescent was 17 years old in 
the on-demand arm. All subjects were Caucasian.  
Overall, 2 subjects (10.5%) had VWD of Type 1, 4 (21.1%) of Type 2A, and the remaining 13 (68.4%) 
of  Type  3,  with  similar  distributions  in  prophylaxis  and  on-demand  arms.  The  2  subjects  in  the 
prophylaxis & on-demand arm both had VWD of Type 2A (of which one adolescent). Two out of the 3 
children in this study had VWD type 3 and one had VWD type 2A. 
Efficacy results 
  Prophylaxis arm: 
Hemostatic Efficacy:  
Nine subjects (90.0%) of the prophylaxis arm reported a total of 118 NSB events during the study, 96 
of which required treatment; 1 adult subject had no bleeding events on the prophylaxis regimen. The 
median number of NSB events per subject was 8.0 (range of 0-33). The majority of these events were 
spontaneous  (79.7%),  minor  (89.8%),  mucosal  (88.1%),  and  treated  at  home  (81.4%).  Seven 
subjects  experienced  a  total  of  12  major  NSB  events,  including  4  subjects  with  a  total  of  5  major 
mucosal NSB events.  
Haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  for  all  96  events  treated  with  Voncento,  as 
excellent or good and as moderate for 2 events (2.1%). The haemostatic efficacy of major NSB events 
was assessed as excellent for 5 events (41.7%), including 3 major mucosal events, and as good for 7 
events (58.3%), including 2 major mucosal events.  The subject’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
of bleeding days was in line with the investigator’s assessment. 
VWF:RCo/FVIII:C concentrates usage:  
In the prophylaxis arm, the median number of infusions was 108.5 (range: 19-406). The median dose 
per  infusion  was  42.75  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  (range:  28.49-85.79  IU/kg).  The  majority  of  bleeding  events 
either required no Voncento treatment (18.6% of events) or only 1 infusion of Voncento (71.2%). 
Paediatrics: 
Hemostatic Efficacy:  
In the prophylaxis arm, 58 of the 96 treated NSB events occurred in the 3 children, who therefore had 
a higher NSB frequency than the 7 adults in the prophylaxis arm.  42 occurred spontaneously, 16 by 
trauma. 
The  hemostatic  efficacy  for  all  these  events  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  either  excellent 
(91.4%)  or  good  (8.6%),  with  a  higher  proportion  of  assessments  of  excellent  than  in  the  total 
prophylaxis arm. The distribution of NSB events in children across bleeding types was similar compared 
with the total prophylaxis arm. 
Rapporteur’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/288706/2015  
Page 10/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  3-monthly  hemostatic  efficacy  assessment  by  the  investigator  for  the  3  children  was  excellent 
throughout, except for 2 assessments of good at Months 6 and 27. Similarly, the monthly assessment 
by the subject (or legal guardian) was excellent for each month with the exception of 2 assessments of 
good at Months 26 and 27. 
VWF:RCo/FVIII:C concentrates usage:  
The children in the prophylaxis arm received a median number of infusions of 71 (range 67-379). The 
median dose per infusion was 57,76 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 47,9- 86,28 IU/kg).  
Assessor’s comment: 
The median number of NSB bleeds of the prophylaxis treatment was lower then in the on-demand arm, 
however it is difficult to draw conclusions on  this since  the study groups are  small and diverse.  The 
prophylaxis  treatment  shows  similar  results  as  in  CSCLT-BIO-08-54  where  the  prophylaxis  treatment 
was  proven  efficacious.  The  children  in  study  CSCLT-BIO-09-64  showed  higher  NSB  frequency  on 
prophylaxis    than  the  7  adults  but  the  hemostatic  efficacy  throughout  the  study  was  similar  to  the 
adults.  
When  compared  with  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-54,  the  median  number  of  NSB 
events per year in the 3 children (22.2 events) and the 7 adults (0.6 events) of the prophylaxis arm in 
this study was similar to corresponding median numbers in the prophylaxis arm of study CSLCT-BIO-
08-52 (23.5 events) and of the adult/adolescent study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (1.0 event).  
The median dose per infusion received during prophylaxis by the 3 pediatric patients  (2 age 6 years, 1 
age 9 years) was 57,76 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 47,9- 86,28 IU/kg), and is higher then the dose in the 
adults (42.75 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 28.49-85.79 IU/kg).  
Similarly, (data from the CSR of studies CSL-CT-08-52 and CSL-CT-08-54), the median average dose 
in  the  4  children  (then  aged  2  to  8  years)  who  had  received  prophylaxis  in  the  preceding  paediatric 
study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 was 62.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion. In adults (n = 8, all aged > 18 years) 
on  prophylaxis  in  the  preceding  study  CSL-CT-08-54,  the  median  average  dose  was  28.8  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg per infusion.  
Although it is generally considered that young  pediatric patients may require higher doses or shorter 
dose intervals, the company is asked to discuss the considerably higher dose per infusion used by the 
patients  <12  years  while  on  a  prophylaxis  regimen  in  study  CSL-CT-08-52  and  CSL-T-BIO-09-64 
compared to adults. 
On-demand arm 
• Haemostatic Efficacy:  
One subject of the on-demand arm did not experience any bleeding events during the study and was 
therefore excluded from analyses. The 7 subjects (including 1  adolescent) experienced a total of 402 
NSB  events,  resulting  in  a  median  number  of  NSB  events  per  subject  of  35.0  (range  of  1-151).  The 
majority of the NSB events were spontaneous ([98.8%), minor (97.8%), and mucosal (98.0%). Three 
subjects experienced a total of 9 major NSB events, including 1 major mucosal NSB. 
For each 3-month interval, the haemostatic efficacy as excellent for 35 events (45.5%), as good for 41 
events (53.2%), and as moderate for the 1 remaining event (1.3%). The haemostatic efficacy of major 
NSB  events  was  assessed  as  excellent  for  6  events  (66.7%)  and  as  good  for  3  events  (33.3%) 
including  the  single  major  mucosal  event  in  the  on-demand  arm  (post-surgical  oral  bleeding).  The 
haemostatic efficacy was  assessed by the  subject  / legal guardian  as excellent for 34.6%  of  the  107 
assessed  bleeding  days,  as  good  for  21.5%,  and  as  moderate  for  43.9%  (associated  with  menstrual 
bleedings).

Subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  had  a  median  number  of  17.0  infusions  (range:  1-67)  at  a  median 
dose  of  54.57  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  per  infusion  (range:  40.00-85.97  IU/kg).  80,8%  of  the  bleedings 
required no Voncento treatment and 10,7%  only 1 infusion of Voncento (10.7%). 
The haemostatic efficacy for the 1 adolescent subject in the on-demand arm was similar to that seen in 
the total on-demand arm.  The adolescent in the on-demand arm had 34.0 infusions at a dose of 59.87 
IU VWF:RCo/kg.  
Assessor’s comment: 
The haemostatic efficacy of the adolescent in the on-demand arm was similar to the adults. In subjects 
treated  on-demand,  the median  number  of  bleeding  events  per  year  in  this study  (11.1  events)  was 
lower than in the on-demand arm of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (19.5 events). No children were included 
in the on-demand arm.   
Prophylaxis & on-demand arm 
Two subjects (1 adult and 1 adolescent) started with prophylaxis treatment, but were switched to on-
demand treatment after 3 and 6 months. Hemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator for the 
97 events treated with Voncento, as excellent (63.9%) or  good (36.1%). The haemostatic efficacy of 
the  6  major  NSB  events  was  assessed  as  excellent  (33.3%)  or    good  (66.7%).  The  haemostatic 
efficacy assessed by the subjects was rated similarly. All treated NSB events resolved within 1 day. 
The  2  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  &  on-demand  arm  received  62  and  65  infusions  with  an  average 
Voncento  dose  per  infusion  of  23.89  and  31.99  IU  VWF:RCo/kg.  Both  subjects  received  15  infusions 
each  as  prophylaxis  treatment,  with  an  average  doses  n  of  22.00  and  30.14  IU  VWF:RCo/kg.  The 
remaining number of on-demand  infusions had an  average doses of 24.50 and 32.54 IU VWF:RCo/kg. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  haemostatic  efficacy  of  the  2  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  and  on-demand  treatment  was 
considered as good or excellent. The dosage received by the 2 subjects for the prophylaxis as well as 
for the on-demand  treatment is however much lower then the median administered to the groups.  
However, as this concerns only one adult and one adolescent, it is not possible to attach significance to 
this observation. 
Surgical events 
During the study, 7 subjects, including 2 children, underwent a total of 13 surgeries, 4 subjects in the 
prophylaxis arm with 1 minor surgery each and 3 subjects in the on-demand arm with 9 surgeries, of 
which  3  were  major.  The  investigator’s  assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  at  discharge  from  the 
hospital was assessed as excellent for  11 surgical events (including the 3 major events) and as good 
for 2 events. Where available, the subject rated the haemostatic efficacy as either excellent or good for 
all  days  except  for  3  of  8  days  and  1  of  3  days  for  the  2  major  surgeries  (teeth  extractions)  in  the 
same subject. Blood loss during surgery was assessed as equivalent to that expected in the 4 surgical 
events that occurred in 4 subjects of the prophylaxis arm and 7 of the 9 surgeries in the on demand 
arm, and less than expected in the remaining 2 surgeries in the on-demand arm.  
No subject required blood product transfusions. 
Safety results 
During this extension study, 16 subjects (84.2%) reported a total of 79 TEAEs: 7 subjects (70.0%) in 
the prophylaxis arm had 55 TEAEs, all 7 subjects (100.0%) in the on-demand arm had 21 TEAEs, and 
the 2 subjects in the prophylaxis & on-demand arm had 3 TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs,

each  reported  by  3  subjects  (15.8%),  were  anaemia,  arthralgia,  nasopharyngitis,  and  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection.  Three  subjects  reported  a  total  of  5  serious  TEAEs:  One  subject  with 
diabetes  insipidus,  gastric  ulcer,  and  pneumonia,  and  1  subject  each  with  dysfunctional  uterine 
bleeding  and  mild  carcinoma  of  the  cervix  (stage  0;  resolved  with  sequelae  after  15  days  following 
surgery), respectively. The gastric ulcer and pneumonia events led to death of the subject; the gastric 
ulcer was present prior to the first administration, and the pneumonia was not considered related to or 
study procedures by both the investigator and the sponsor. No ADRs, AEs leading to discontinuation of 
Voncento,  or  TEAEs  of  special  interest  (development  of  FVIII  /  VWF  inhibitors,  virus  transmissions, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and embolic and thrombotic events) occurred during this study. 
Paediatric data 
Other  than  TEAEs  that  are  typical  childhood  diseases,  there  were  no  major  differences  in  the  TEAE 
reporting  profile  between  the  3  children,  2  adolescents,  and  14  adults  included  in  the  safety 
population.  The  3  children  included  in  the  study  (all  in  the  prophylaxis  arm)  reported  a  total  of  42 
TEAEs  (respiratory  infections,  arthralgia,  anemia,  gastrointestinal  complaints)  .  One  subject  (9  years 
old) had 4 TEAEs that were severe in intensity (acute tonsillitis, severe tonsillitis, upper abdominal pain, 
and severe post-traumatic pain). Other TEAEs reported for the children were mild or moderate.  
Overall,  the  AE  reporting  profile  was  typical  for  children  with  higher  incidences  of  infection-related 
diseases and symptoms as well as injuries and falls, compared with the adult population.  
The 2 adolescents included in the study reported a total of 5 TEAEs. One subject (aged 17 years) in the 
on-demand arm reported 4 TEAEs (nasopharyngitis and 3 cases of anaemia) and one subject (aged 16 
years) in the prophylaxis & on-demand arm had a moderate TEAE of bronchitis. 
Safety Conclusion 
The children included in this study showed similar TEAE as adults, apart from AE related to the age of 
population.  In  study  CSCLT-BIO-08-52  (pivotal  study)  AEs  associated  with  common  cold  such  as 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and rhinitis, but also injuries were more frequently observed in the paediatric 
subjects (age <12) then adults. 
Importantly, no development of FVIII / VWF inhibitors, virus transmissions, hypersensitivity reactions, 
or  embolic and thrombotic events were reported. 
Therefore,  results  from  study  CSCLT-09-64  support  the  safety  results  from  CSCLT_BIO-08-52  and  it 
can  be  concluded  that  no  apparent  clinically  relevant  differences  were  found  between  adults  and 
children regarding the safety of Voncento in VWD.  
For the adolescents, the cases of anaemia have not been described in the SPC for adults, therefore the 
MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  these  findings  in  relation  to  the  Voncento  treatment  and  bleeding 
events/blood loss in these patients.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy summary: 
Voncento showed a long/term efficacy of a prophylaxis regimen and on-demand therapy with Voncento 
in preventing non-surgical bleeding (NSB) events (median per subject of 8 in prophylaxis and 35 in on-
demand  arm)  and  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  subjects  with  (VWD)  who  require  a  (VWF) 
product  to  control  an  NSB  event.  The  assessment  of  the  haemostatic  efficacy  as  assessed  by  the 
investigator and the subjects was rated excellent or good at multiple time points (e.g. at discharge, at 
treatment  days)  for  13  surgical  events  (including  the  3  major  events).  No  subject  required  blood 
product transfusions.

article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Page 13/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover,  long-term  data  on  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  for  subjects  who  underwent  surgical 
procedures  during  the  study  period  was  shown.  This  study  however  only  provided  data  on  a  small 
group of subjects.  
The  3  children  (2  with  Type  3  and  1  with  Type  2A  VWD)  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  had  a  higher  NSB 
frequency  than  the  7  adults  in  the  prophylaxis  arm.  The  haemostatic  efficacy  for  the  3  children  was 
similar to that for the adults.  
The  haemostatic  efficacy  for  the  1  adolescent  subject  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  in  the  prophylaxis 
and  on-demand  arm  was  similar  to  overall  on-demand  arm.  No  children  were  included  in  the  on-
demand arm. 
When  compared  with  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-54,  in  which  the  subjects  were 
treated  prior  to  this  extension  study,  the  median  number  of  NSB  events  per  year  in  the  3  children 
(22.2  events)  and  the  7  adults  (0.6  events)  of  the  prophylaxis  arm  in  this  study  was  similar  to 
corresponding median numbers in the prophylaxis arm of the 12-month children study CSLCT-BIO-08-
52 (23.5 events) and the 12-month prophylaxis treatment period of the adult/adolescent study CSLCT-
BIO-08-54  (1.0  event).  In  subjects  treated  on-demand,  the  median  number  of  bleeding  events  per 
year  in  this  study  (11.1  events;  all  subjects  previously  participating  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54)  was 
lower than in the on-demand arm of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (19.5 events).  
It seems reasonable to conclude that efficacy has been reached in this extension study. For paediatric 
patients  the  comparison  of  prophylaxis  versus  on-demand  arm  in  NSB  events  could  not  be  made, 
however the data of the children and adolescents behaved similar to the adults, therefore a difference 
in efficacy is not likely to occur. 
Dosing in paediatric population: 
The  posology  which  was  approved  for  the  Voncento  SPC  gives  the  same  recommendations  as  in  the 
Core SPC with the qualification that dosing in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years is based on body weight 
and is therefore generally based on the same guidelines as in adults. No recommendation is currently 
made for dosage in children <12 years due to lack of data. 
Safety summary: 
The population studied is very small, however it can be concluded that the AE profile is mild. 
The children included in this study showed similar TEAE as adults, apart from AE related to the age of 
population.  In  study  CSCLT-BIO-08-52  (pivotal  study)  AEs  associated  with  common  cold  such  as 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and rhinitis, but also injuries were more frequently observed in the pediatric 
subjects  (age  <12)  than  adults.  Importantly,  no  development  of  FVIII  /  VWF  inhibitors,  virus 
transmissions, hypersensitivity reactions, or  embolic and thrombotic events were reported.  Therefore 
results  from  study  CSCLT-09-64  support  the  safety  results  from  CSCLT-BIO-08-52  and  it  can  be 
concluded  that  no  apparent  clinically  relevant  differences  were  found  between  adults  and  children 
regarding the safety of Voncento in VWD.  
For the adolescents, the cases of anaemia have not been described in the SPC for adults, therefore the 
MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  these  findings  in  relation  to  the  Voncento  treatment  and  bleeding 
events/blood loss in these patients. 
Overall conclusion 
This  study  shows  long-term  Voncento  exposure  in  paediatric  and  adolescent  subjects  with 
VWD  who  require  prophylaxis  or  on-demand  treatment  with  a  VWF.  It  is  difficult  to  draw 
conclusions  for  the  extension  study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64  on  the  paediatric  population  due  to  the  small 
amount  of  children.    The  company  is  asked  to  answer  the  points  of  clarification  before  a  definitive 
positive B/R can be given.

The  MAH  does  not  propose  any  changes  in  the  product  information.  The  SPC  currently 
carries the statement that “the safety and efficacy of Voncento in children < 12 years have 
not been established. No data are available.”. Currently a procedure is ongoing in which data 
from pediatric study CSL-CT-08-52 has been assessed, this involved 17 children with VWD. 
As  part  of  this  procedure  an  SPC  update  regarding  the  posology  in  children  will  be  carried 
out. Based on the data from study CSLCT-BIO-09-64 it is not considered necessary to alter 
this statement. 
Recommendation  (preliminary) 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications as part of this procedure. 
(see section IV “Additional clarifications requested”) 
Additional clarifications requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide description of the additional clarifications as part 
of this procedure. Comments on the preliminary AR were received from DE and FR. 
The MAH is to clarify the following points : 
1.  Regarding  Efficacy  of  Voncento  in  the  Paediatric  population  the  MAH  might  provide  comparative 
numbers  on  product  consumption.  According  to  the  respective  Clinical  Guideline,  consumption  of 
FVIII and vWF should be presented as IU/kg per event (for on-demand treatment and surgery) as 
well  as  IU/kg  per  (month  or)  year  for  prophylaxis-regimen.  Although  patient  numbers  are  low, 
comparison of consumption in paediatric, adolescent and adult subjects may contribute exploratory 
information. 
2.  This study doesn't  propose  any  justification  about  the  choice  of  posology  in  children,  as  it  was 
mentioned at  the  time  of the  variation  II-08  at  CHMP.  Although  it  is  generally  considered  that 
young    paediatric  patients  may  require  higher  doses  or  shorter  dose  intervals,  the  company  is 
asked  to  discuss  the  dose  per  infusion  used  by  the  patients  <12  years  while  on  a  prophylaxis 
regimen in study CSL-CT-08-52 and CSL-T-BIO-09-64 compared to adults. 
3.  Safety: For the adolescents, the MAH is requested to discuss the 3 episodes of anaemia in Subject 
08-54-07001 in relation to the Voncento treatment and bleeding events/blood loss.

2. Clinical Aspects  
2.1 Efficacy 
Other concerns 
Question 1: 
Regarding  Efficacy  of  Voncento  in  the  Paediatric  population  the  MAH  might  provide  comparative 
numbers on product consumption. According to the respective Clinical Guideline, consumption of FVIII 
and  vWF  should  be  presented  as  IU/kg  per  event  (for  on-demand  treatment and  surgery)  as  well  as 
IU/kg per (month or) year for prophylaxis-regimen. Although patient numbers are low, comparison of 
consumption in paediatric, adolescent and adult subjects may contribute exploratory information  
Summary of MAH answer  
There  were  10  subjects  in  the  extension  study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  3  paediatric  (<  12  years,  from 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52) and 7 adults (> 18 years, from study CSLCT-BIO-08-54) who received prophylactic 
treatment  with  Voncento.  No  adolescent  subjects,  between  12  and  <  18  years  of  age,  were  on 
prophylactic treatment. The consumption, expressed as the mean prophylactic dose (VWF:RCo IU/kg) 
and  the  mean  calculated  prophylactic  dose  per  year  (VWF:RCo  IU/kg),  as  well  as  the  frequency  of 
infusion and the doses administered per individual subject, by age group, are provided in Table 2.

EMA/CHMP/288706/2015  
Page 16/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 3 children, the mean dose per infusion for prophylaxis was 64.0 IU/kg and the mean dose per 
year 7799 IU/kg VWF:RCo. The number of prophylaxis infusions given to children was between 0.9 and 
3.1 infusions per week, excluding the infusions administered for bleeding. Seven adults continued their 
prophylaxis  regimen  in  the  extension  study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64.  The  frequency  of  administration  was 
between  0.9  and  2.9  infusions  per  week  and  this  was  very  similar  to  the  frequency  in  the  children. 
However, the mean prophylactic doses per infusion and per year were 58 and 39% lower in adults than 
in  children,  37.1  IU/kg  and  3049  IU/kg/year,  respectively.  This  observation  was  expected  due  to  a 
generally higher clearance in young paediatric patients of these products. These children may require 
higher  doses  or  shorter  dose  intervals  to  obtain  an  optimal  efficacy.  No  apparent  clinically  relevant 
differences were found between adults and children regarding the safety of Voncento in VWD. 
On-demand treatment 
There were 8 subjects in the extension study CSLCT-BIO-09-64 who received on-demand treatment, 1 
adolescent and 7 adults from study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. However, 1 of the adults was not treated for a 
non-surgical bleed with Voncento and was therefore not included in the analysis. No children below the 
age  of  12  received  treatment  on-demand.  The  total  dose  and  mean  dose  administered  per  bleeding 
event in the 1 adolescent and 6 adult subjects are presented by the MAH. 
The mean dose to stop a bleeding event in the adolescent was 60.5 IU/kg and the mean dose for the 
adult subjects was 55.0 IU/kg/event, over a range from 38.3 to 86.0 IU/kg/event. Therefore, Voncento 
consumption in the adult and adolescent subjects to induce haemostasis was similar. 
Surgery 
During the extension study, 7 subjects (2 children and 5 adults), underwent a total of 13 surgeries; no 
adolescent  subjects  required  surgery  during  the  study.  Details  on  the  number  of  surgical  events  and 
doses  administered  (CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  Efficacy/PP  population)  have  been  supplied  by  the  MAH.  The 
doses  administered  during  surgery  in  the  2  children  (<  12  years)  were  68  and  533.3  IU  VWF:RCo 
/kg/event  (1  event  a  single  infusion  the  other  10  infusions  in  total).  In  the  adult  subjects,  doses 
ranged from 29.7 and 110.8 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion, with doses from 29.7 to 442.6 IU/kg/event 
for minor surgery and from 352 to 939 IU/kg/event for major surgery. 
The  doses  administered  during  minor  surgery  for  the  paediatric  and  adult  subjects  receiving 
prophylaxis treatment was similar (range 46.7–68.0 IU/kg/event) with no requirement for postsurgical 
infusions.  The  doses  received  by  the  on-demand  subjects  for  minor  surgery  varied  according  to  the 
surgery  type,  for  example  tooth  extraction  (in  2  subjects,  5  events)  required  a  dose  of  88.0–110.8 
IU/kg,  followed  up  with  post-surgical  doses  in  the  range  56.7–73.8  IU/kg  (although  the  total  dose 
varied  148  –  851  IU/kg).  For  major  surgery,  a  direct  comparison  of  dosage  (consumption)  is  not 
possible between adult and paediatric subjects as no paediatric patients required major surgery. 
Rapporteur’s  Assessment  
The MAH has supplied data on the consumption of vWF for the prophylaxis treatment, the on-demand 
treatment and during surgery. For the prophylaxis treatment the frequency of infusion was very similar 
between adults and children. The mean prophylactic doses  per infusion and  per year were, however,  
58 and 39% lower in adults than in children, respectively. From the pharmacokinetic data submitted as 
part of procedure EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G, it has been shown that dose/kg-normalised AUC and 
Cmax are somewhat lower in the population <12 years, as compared to the population > 12 years. It 
is acknowledged that the lower incremental recovery in VWF patients < 12 years supports the higher 
dose used in this population as compared to the > 12 years population.  
For on-demand treatment the consumption of Voncento in the adult and adolescent subjects to induce 
haemostasis was similar, however only 1 adolescent was included in this study-arm.

The  doses  administered  during  minor  surgery  for  the  paediatric  (n=2)  and  adult  (n=5)  subjects 
receiving prophylaxis treatment was similar. The doses received by the on-demand subjects for minor 
surgery  varied  according  to  the  surgery  type.  For  major  surgery,  a  direct  comparison  of  dosage 
(consumption) is not possible between adult and paediatric subjects as no paediatric patients required 
major surgery. 
Issue resolved 
Question 2: 
This  study  doesn't  propose  any  justification  about  the  choice  of  posology  in  children,  as  it  was 
mentioned at the time of the variation II-08 at CHMP. Although it is generally considered that young 
paediatric patients may require higher doses or shorter dose intervals, the company is asked to discuss 
the dose per infusion used by the patients <12 years while on a prophylaxis regimen in study CSL-CT-
08-52 and CSL-T-BIO-09-64 compared to adults. 
Summary of MAH answer  
The  paediatric  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  included  17  children  <12  years  old.  Four  subjects  were 
allocated to the prophylaxis therapy (Arm 1) and 13 to on-demand therapy (Arm 2). At the completion 
of  the  study,  3  of  the  4  prophylaxis  subjects,  continued  treatment  with  Voncento  in  the  extension 
study (CSLCT-BIO-09-64) for up to an additional 32 months of treatment. The fourth paediatric subject 
receiving  prophylaxis  treatment  in  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  had  previously  received  on-demand  treatment. 
This subject did not continue treatment in the extension study.  
Prophylaxis treatment 
The recommendation for prophylaxis dosing in the VWD clinical trial protocols was the same  for both 
paediatric (CSLCT-BIO-08-52) and adult/adolescent subjects (CSLCT-BIO-08-54): 25-40 IU/kg, 1 to 3 
times per week. However, the 3 paediatric subjects were noted to continue their previous prophylactic 
dose and regimen into the study. In the year before study enrolment 3 prophylactic subjects from the 
site in Bremen were treated with Haemate P  with doses  higher than indicated in the protocol (40-80 
IU/kg, 1-3 times per week). Their doses were observed to increase during the course of the extension 
study.  The investigator decided to continue the Haemate regimen and dose level in the study. While it 
is acknowledged that the actual doses used were higher than indicated in the protocol, a mean of 58.7 
IU/kg  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  a  mean  of  64.0  IU/kg  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  the 
haemostatic  efficacy  and  safety  results  were  very  good,  in  spite  of  the  increase  in  number  of  minor 
mucosal and superficial bleeds. 
The prophylactic frequency and doses used in children and adults in CSLCT-BIO-09-64 are summarised 
in the response to Question 1, Table 2. In order to compare the prophylactic dosing regimen in adults 
and children from studies CSLCT-BIO-08-52, CSLCT-BIO-08-54 to the dosing regimen of the extension 
study (CSLCT-BIO-09-64) mean doses are presented in Table 3.

The actual doses administered to the adult subjects were a mean of 37.1 IU/kg in study CSLCTBIO-09-
64  which  were  within  the  proposed  prophylactic  dose  range  of  25-40  IU/kg  body  weight.  The  actual 
doses  administered  to the  paediatric  subjects  were  a  mean  of  58.7  IU/kg  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52 
and  a  mean  of  64.0  IU/kg  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64.  For  subject  110101  the  mean  dose  increased 
approximately  30%  to  86.3  IU/kg  VWF:RCo  during  the  extension  study.  This  subject  received 
treatment  for  a  further  848  treatment  days.  The  mean  doses  of  subjects  110102  and  110103  were 
similar, with a dose decrease of approximately 18 and 11%, respectively during the extension study. 
Although  for  these  subjects  the  number  of  bleeds  changed  (a  reduction  for  subjects  110101  and 
110103, an increase for subject 110102; (predominantly minor mucosal bleeds with a few superficial 
trauma bleeds/bruises)) the majority of haemostatic efficacy ratings were excellent. 
Based  on  the  actual  doses  used  in  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  the  MAH  is 
proposing to amend the prophylactic dose range to 40-80 IU/kg body weight 1 to 3 times per week for 
paediatrics under the age of 12 (part of procedure EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G) 
On-demand treatment 
For on demand subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 the recommended doses were the same as those 
recommended  for  adults  (in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54);  i.e.  for  non-surgical  bleeds  25–50  IU/kg.  The 
actual  on-demand  doses  (mean  and  median)  administered  by  the  12  paediatric  subjects  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52 are provided in Table 8. These subjects in the on demand arm who treated  a NSB, 
had  a  mean  number  of  10.4  infusions  at  a  mean  Biostate  dose  of  47.6  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  per  infusion 
(median 40.8 IU/kg, range 30.2-88.6, Table 8). Although the majority of the administered doses were 
within the proposed dose range of 25-50 IU/kg VWF:RCo, some were higher, with a maximum of 88.6 
IU/kg  to  treat  a  NSB.  The  haemostatic  efficacy  and  safety  results  were  good,  although  not  all  were 
assessed as excellent by both the investigator and subjects.  
For  on-demand  treatment,  the  MAH  maintains  that  the  dosing of  the  paediatric  population  below  the 
age of 12 should be based on the same guidance as that for adults and adolescents, i.e. 40 – 80 IU/kg 
of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body weight (BW). 
Additionally,  further  analysis  of  the  prophylactic  dose  used  in  children  was  recently  conducted,  and 
communicated  to  EMA  as  part  of  the  Response  to  questions  for  the  variation  application 
EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G Change to therapeutic indication (VWD).  
Rapporteur’s  Assessment  
A similar question regarding the posology in children was addressed as part of the ongoing procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G. In the response to questions the MAH refers to this procedure.  For the 
sake  of  consistency  a  short  summary  of  the  assessor’s  comment  is  provided  below.  The  presented 
answers by the MAH are in line with procedure II/08/G.  
The data in Table 2 and 3 show that  the 4 children <12 years received a higher mean dose then the 
adult  patients.  It  is  noted  that  3  of  the  4  patients  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  who  received  routine 
prophylaxis were enrolled at the same site (site 110 in Bremen) which may imply a specific treatment 
preference,  but  also  suggests  that  the  approach  to  management  of  these  patients  would  have  been 
consistent. Three subjects continued into extension study CSLCT-BIO-09-64 and received prophylactic 
doses  at  the  same  frequency.  While  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  actual  doses  used  were  higher  than 
indicated in the protocol, a mean of 58.7 IU/kg in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and a mean of 64.0 IU/kg in 
study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  the  haemostatic  efficacy  and  safety  results  were  very  good,  in  spite  of  the 
increase in number of minor mucosal and superficial bleeds.

PK data provided in  EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G from  17 children  <12  years show that  exposure  in 
this age group is lower than in adults and subjects ≥12 years of age.  The lower incremental recovery 
in VWF patients < 12 years supports the higher doses used in this population. The level of efficacy can 
be  considered  clinically  acceptable  and  taking  the  PK  data  into  account,  it  seems  reasonable  to  also 
apply the recommendation of dose range 40 to 80 IU/kg VWF:RiCo to patients <12 years. This is the 
dose range currently approved for  Voncento for the treatment of bleeds in  patients ≥12 years and is 
also  the  dose  recommended  in  the  Core  SPC  for  VWF  products  and  allows  for  dosages  up  to  80  IU 
VWF:RCo.  In  view  of  the  similar  PK  data  in  patients  aged  from  12  to  18  years  it  can  be  agreed that 
prophylactic dosing in this age group can be based on the same guidelines as for adults. 
A  modification  of  the  information  on  dosing  in  the  paediatric  population  in  SmPC  Section  4.2  is 
recommended in procedure EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G, and is suggested as follows: 
Paediatric VWD population  
Treatment of bleeding: 
Usually 40  -  80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20  -  40 IU  FVIII:C/kg of 
body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. 
Prophylaxis treatment: 
In patients aged 12 to 18 years old dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults.  
Based  on  results  from  a  clinical  trial  in  paediatric  patients  under  12  years  of  age  to  achieve 
haemostasis, in this age group a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 
3 times a week should be considered. 
The  dose  and  duration  of  treatment  will  depend  on  the  clinical  status  of  the  patient,  as  well  as  their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
The  Issue  was  resolved  with  the  SPC  adjustments  carried  out  as  part  of  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G.

Other concerns 
Question 3 
For  the  adolescents,  the  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  3  episodes  of  anaemia  in  Subject  08-54-
07001 in relation to the Voncento treatment and bleeding events/blood loss in this patient. 
Summary of MAH answer  
Subject  07001was  a  17  year  old  female  subject  with  type  3  VWD  who  entered  the  extension  study 
from study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and was assigned to the on-demand treatment arm. The subject stayed 
on study for 32 months. During the study she experienced 32 bleeding events (monthly menorrhagia 
except  for  4  joint  bleedings),  all  of  which  could  be  controlled  by  1  infusion  of  Biostate  with  the 
exception of bleeding event # 2 (6 infusions) and #4 (3 infusions). The efficacy of Biostate was rated 
by the investigator as excellent at all study visits (3 monthly) except for month 15, month 18, month 
21, month 30 and month 32 when efficacy was reported as good.

Page 20/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  subject  entered  the  study  with  a  low  baseline  hemoglobin  level  (7.137  mmol/L)  which  was 
assessed as not clinically significant. The subjects hemoglobin levels stayed low throughout the entire 
study, ranging between 5.275mmol/L and 7.633 mmol/L. 
Anaemia  was  reported  as  an  AE  on  3  occasions  from  15  March-15  June  2011,  14  Sep  2011-17  Sep 
2012 and 13 Mar -06 June 2013. All AEs were assessed as not related to the study drug, and the dose 
of Biostate was not changed. Anaemia was treated with administration of iron (Tardyferon®, oral) and 
vitamin B 12. The AEs were not connected to any specific bleeding event. 
Rapporteur’s  Assessment  
The MAHs opinion that the adverse events of anaemia in subject 07001 were not related to the study 
drug can be supported. The subject had low haemoglobin at study entry and this remained low during 
the study. Moreover, Voncento efficacy was rated excellent or good by the investigator.   
Issue resolved 
Recommendation  (final) 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  procedure  P46  010  was  approvable,  in  the  light  of  the  relevant  SPC 
adjustment carried out as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G .

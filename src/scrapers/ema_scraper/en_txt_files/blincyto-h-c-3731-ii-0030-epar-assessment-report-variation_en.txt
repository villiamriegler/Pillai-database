To modify the approved therapeutic indication to include the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome 
positive CD19 positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adult and paediatric 
patients with relapsed or refractory ALL and adult patients in first or second complete remission with 
minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and the PL are updated accordingly. The updated RMP version 10.0 
has also been submitted.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information relating to orphan designation 
BLINCYTO, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/09/650 on 24 July 2009. BLINCYTO 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  EMA  Decision 
P/0014/2016  (PIP  Modification:  EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M02,  dated  19  December  2017)  on  the 
acceptance of a modification of an agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0014/2016  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred.  
The PIP targets paediatric patients from 1 month to less than 18 years of age with first high-risk relapse 
of  B-cell  precursor  ALL  and  includes  2  clinical  studies  and  1  pharmacokinetics/  pharmacodynamics 
(PK/PD) analysis. 
The EMA/PDCO Partial Compliance check, dated 16 December 2016 confirmed that Study 1 (Protocol 
MT103 205) and Study 3 (Protocol 120391) were completed in compliance with the PIP. A subsequent 
PIP modification (PIP Modification: EMEA-000574-PIP02-12- M02, dated 19 December 2017) to the key 
elements of the ongoing PIP Study 2 (Protocol 20120215) did not affect the completion date of Study 2 
which is deferred to July 2023. Therefore, the current Partial Compliance Check Report 
(EMA/740953/2016, adopted on 16 December 2016) is still considered valid.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
In  the  European  Union  (EU),  blinatumomab  (BLINCYTO®)  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
adults  and  children  greater  than  1  years  old  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  relapsed  or 
refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for the treatment of adults in first or 
second hematologic complete remission (CR) with Philadelphia chromosome-negative minimal residual 
disease (MRD)-positive ALL. 
The purpose of this variation application is to widen the indication to include:  
1)  The treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed/refractory ALL 
who have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative 
treatment options.  
This extension is based on the results from a phase 2, single-arm study (Study 20120216). A historical 
control study (Study 20160462) and a propensity score analysis were conducted to estimate the effects 
of  blinatumomab  compared  with  standard  of  care  ALL  therapy  for  treatment  of  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL.  
2)  The treatment of paediatric patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL who have 
failed treatment with at least 2 TKIs and have no alternative treatment options. 
Available data are presented for 3 Philadelphia-positive subjects from Study MT103-205 who were < 18 
years of age. 
3)   The treatment of adult patients in first or second hematologic CR with Philadelphia-positive MRD-
positive ALL.  
Results from the assessment of MRD response are presented for adult subjects with Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  from  Study  20120216  and  from  the  subset  of  adult  subjects  (N  =  10)  in 
hematologic CR with Philadelphia-positive MRD-positive ALL from the MRD-positive ALL studies MT103-
203 and MT103-202. 
Disease or condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a rare aggressive cancer of the blood and bone marrow. In the EU, more 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 8/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
than 7,200 new cases are diagnosed annually (Gatta et al, 2011) with approximately 3,000 diagnoses 
occurring in adults (Inaba et al, 2013). The majority of ALL cases are B-lineage, Philadelphia-negative 
ALL. 
The Philadelphia chromosome is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of 
chromosome  9  and  22  [t(9;22)  (q34:q11)]  leading  to  the  formation  of  the  bcr-abl  fusion  gene.  This 
translocation occurs in 3% to 5% of children and 20% to 30% of adults with B-cell precursor ALL.  
Epidemiology and risk factors  
The estimated overall incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma 
in Europe is 1.28 per 100 000 individuals annually, with significant age-related variations (0.53 at 45–
54 years, 
1.0 at 55–74 years and 1.45 at 75–99 years) and that of Burkitt leukaemia/lymphoma is 
between 0.17 and 0.33 in the same age groups (Sant, 2010). These figures qualify ALL as a rare 
∼
disease in adults, making assessment and care at qualified centres highly desirable. Predisposing risk 
factors for adult ALL are not known, contrary to childhood ALL (Inaba, 2013). In Europe, 5-year overall 
survival (OS) improved from 29.8% in the years 1997–1999 to 41.1% in 2006–2008 (P < 0.0001), 
still as a function of age. Compared with the reference group (age 15–54 years: OS >50%), OS was 
<30% in the 55–64 years age group (hazard ratio 2.05) and <20% in the ≥65 years age group (hazard 
ratios 2.71 and 3.75) (Sant, 2014). 
Management 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended in first remission for patients 
with Philadelphia-positive ALL. Since the introduction of TKIs, the objective response rates are similar 
between subjects with Philadelphia-negative ALL and subjects with Philadelphia-positive ALL (Thomas et 
al, 2004; Yanada and Naoe, 2006); however, duration of response and relapse-free survival (RFS) have 
remained short in ALL Phi+ patients. 
Treatment of Philadelphia-positive ALL patients who are resistant to or relapse after first-line therapy 
remains challenging. For this population, in the absence of a clinical study with a novel agent, treatment 
with an alternative TKI (ie, different from the TKI used as part of induction therapy, typically dasatinib 
or ponatinib) with or without additional chemotherapy could be considered and is recommended with 
allogeneic  HSCT  if  a  second  remission  is  achieved  (National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  [NCCN] 
Guidelines, 2018; Fielding, 2015; Fielding, 2011). For subjects who received an allogeneic HSCT in first 
remission, donor lymphocyte infusion or second allogeneic HSCT can be considered. 
Recently,  2  non-TKI  treatments  were  approved  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  ALL  that 
included Philadelphia-positive ALL subjects in the pivotal trials. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) is 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell 
precursor ALL (Besponsa SmPC, 2017); adult patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory 
B-cell  precursor  ALL  should  have  failed  treatment  with  at  least  1  TKI.  Tisagenlecleucel  (Kymriah)  is 
indicated for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell ALL 
that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant, or in second or later relapse (Kymriah SmPC, 2018). 
The use of molecular remission may bridge the gap between hematologic and cytogenetic remission 
and long-term survival as it is a harbinger of poor outcome (Ravandi, 2011; Radich, 2002).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 expressed 
on  the  surface  of  cells  of  B-lineage  origin  and  CD3  expressed  on  the  surface  of  T-cells.  It  activates 
endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on benign and 
malignant B-cells.  
In  the  European  Union  (EU),  blinatumomab  (BLINCYTO®)  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
adults  and  children  greater  than  1  years  old  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  relapsed  or 
refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for the treatment of adults in first or 
second hematologic complete remission (CR) with Philadelphia chromosome-negative minimal residual 
disease (MRD)-positive ALL.  
Mechanism of action 
BLINCYTO is a single chain antibody construct of the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) class.  Blincyto 
utilizes a patient’s own T cells to kill CD19-positive B cells, including malignant B-cells. T cells are bound 
by  its  anti-CD3  moiety,  whereas  malignant  and  normal  B  cells  are  bound  by  the  anti-CD19  moiety. 
Blincyto is designed to transiently connect CD19-positive cells with T cells; as part of this action, Blincyto 
causes the formation of a cytolytic synapse between the T cell and the tumor cell, releasing the pore-
forming  protein  perforin  and  the  apoptosis-inducing  proteolytic  enzymes  granzyme  A  and  B.  The 
subsequent serial lysis of multiple malignant cells by a single T cell closely resembles a natural cytotoxic 
T-cell  reaction.  Blincyto-mediated  T-cell  activation  involves  the  transient  release  of  inflammatory 
cytokines and the proliferation of T cells.

treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been submitted 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00; December 2006) states that medicinal products consisting of substances 
occurring naturally in the environment such as vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids are exempted “…because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment,” and consequently do not need to be accompanied by an environmental risk assessment.  
Blinatumomab is a recombinant non-glycosylated protein, consisting of 504 amino acids with a 
molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa. As the molecule is a sequence of amino acids, 
blinatumomab meets the guideline criterion for compounds that are exempt from testing because of 
their chemical structure and constituents that should degrade into their constituent elements in the 
environment. Although, the extension of indication may result in an increase in the total amount of 
blinatumomab used, as per the above guidance, this will not lead to any environmental risks.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has justified the lack for an updated Environmental Risk 
Assessment (ERA) on the ground that blinatumomab is a recombinant protein and is exempted from 
environmental impact evaluations. This is agreed. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 20120216 provided additional PK Data. 
Study 20120216 
Study design 
Study  20120216  was  a  phase  2,  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter  study  designed  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  blinatumomab  in  adult  subjects  (≥  18  years  of  age)  with  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL. 
The study comprised a screening period, an induction treatment period (2 cycles of blinatumomab), a 
consolidation treatment period (up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab for subjects who achieved a 
CR/CRh*/complete  remission  with  incomplete  hematologic  recovery  (CRi)  within  2  induction  cycles of 
treatment), and a safety follow-up visit 30 days after treatment discontinuation. 
One  of  the  secondary  objectives  was  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  blinatumomab  in  adult 
subjects with relapsed/refractory Ph-positive B-precursor ALL 
In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab was 9 μg/day cIV infusion for the first 7 
days of treatment which was increased (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 
29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle through 3 consolidation 
cycles for applicable subjects), the administered dose was 28 μg/day throughout 4 weeks of continuous 
treatment. 
PK samples were taken at steady state in Cycles 1 and 2. 
PK and statistical analysis 
The following PK parameters of blinatumomab were estimated based on individual serum blinatumomab 
concentrations: 
• 
The  steady  state  serum  concentration  (Css),  summarized  as  the  observed  concentrations 
collected  after  approximately  6  hours  or  later  of  cIV  infusion  start  for  cycle  1  and  cycle  2, 
respectively, for each dose level. 
•  Serum clearance (CL) calculated as CL = R0/Css; where R0 is the infusion rate (microg/hr) and 
Css is the dose normalized average Css. Css values used for the calculation of CL were collected 
after approximately 6 hours or later of cIV infusion start for each dose level. 
Actual doses administered and actual sampling times were used for presentation in graphs and nominal 
times  were  used  to  present  data  in  tables.  Blinatumomab  concentrations  below  the  lower  limit  of 
quantification  (LLOQ)  (50.0  pg/mL)  were  set  to  0  before  data  analysis.  All  descriptive  statistics  were 
presented to 3 significant figures, except for % coefficient of variance (CV), which was reported to 1 
decimal place. 
Analytical method 
CD69 activation assay (bioassay) was validated to demonstrate that it is reliable and reproducible for 
the intended use. 
A  total  of  69  test  items  (excluding  d1  samples  taken  prior  of  treatment  for  the  determination  of  the 
baseline) were analyzed for their content of blinatumomab andall fulfilled the acceptance criteria for the 
quality control samples.

7  study  samples  (taken  during  blinatumomab  treatment)  were  reanalyzed  in  a  second  independent 
experiment. The recovery rates of all samples were within the specification (80-120% from initial value 
obtained from the first measurement). The recovery rates ranged from 85% to 109%. 
Assay linearity was investigated in 4 samples. Dilution series (five 1:2 dilution steps) were prepared in 
pooled human serum which was used for the preparation of the calibration standard curve. Linearity with 
a  R²  value  of  1.0  and  a  slope  of  0.9  to  1.1  of  the  calculated  versus  the  expected  blinatumomab 
concentrations was shown in a range from 62 to 1322 pg/mL. 
Population handing 
The PK analysis included all subjects who received blinatumomab and had at least 1 PK sample collected. 
Enrollment in to Study 20120216 was initiated 03rd January 2014 and was completed January 2015. A 
total of 45 subjects received blinatumomab in this phase 2 study. 
Sex  was  evenly  balanced  (53.3%  males;  46.7%  females),  while  the  majority  of  subject  were  white 
(86.7%), without Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (95.6%), and had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 
1 (80%). The median age (range) was 55.0 years (23 to 78 years); 10 subjects (22.2%) were between 
the ages of ≥ 65 years and < 75 years and 2 subjects (4.4%) were ≥ 75 years of age.

Use in paediatric patients 
An extrapolation exercise was submitted by the MAH in the context of a claim for a paediatric indication. 
A  Bayesian  extrapolation  from  adult  subjects  (source)  to  paediatric  subjects  (target)  was  performed. 
Three  different  Bayesian  models  were  used.  The  source  data  come  from  adult  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL subjects available from Amgen-sponsored studies (20120216 and 20160441). 
The target data come from pediatric Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL subjects available from 
Amgen-sponsored  studies  (MT103-205,  20130320,  and  20160441).  In  total,  30  of  78  adult  subjects 
achieved a CR (38.0%; 95%CI: 27.3% to 49.6%), and 5 of 8 pediatric subjects achieved a CR (62.5%; 
95% CI: 24.5% to 91.5%)

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
No new data have been submitted. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
From a PK standpoint, data from new study are sufficient and compatible with previous observations.  
Mean  (SD)  Css  at  the  clinical  doses  of  9  mcg/day  and  28  mcg/day  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed/  or 
refractory  ALL,  the  mean  (SD)  Css  are  now  reported  as  228  (356)  pg/mL  and  616  (537)  pg/mL 
respectively. Mean (SD) volume of distribution based on terminal phase (Vz) value is now reported as 
4.35  (2.45)  L  with  the  continuous  intravenous  infusion  of  blinatumomab.  The  estimated  mean  (SD) 
systemic  clearance  with  continuous  intravenous  infusion  in  patients  receiving  blinatumomab  is  now 
reported  3.11  (2.98)  L/hour  and the  mean  (SD)  half-life  as  2.10  (1.41) hours.  Accordingly  the inter-
patient variability reported in the renal impairment section of Special population is adjusted with data 
added from Study MT103-205 from 95.6% to 96.8%.  
Regarding clinical pharmacology aspects (PK and E-R analysis) on the extrapolation for pediatric subjects 
with Ph+ from adults Ph+, it is important to highlight that using an extrapolation exercise suggesting 
that the indication exists in the adult population and sufficient PK (full extrapolation) or PK/PD (partial 
extrapolation)  data  were  provided  in  the  target  population  in  paediatrics.  According  to  the  applicant, 
since PD data do not exist in the paediatric population, the applicant rely on a full extrapolation approach. 
However, PK data from only 2 patients in this indication were available from which no conclusion on the 
PK similarity between both populations can be drawn. 
Satisfactory  updates  of  the  SmPC  section  5.2  were  implemented.  Data  on  exposure,  distribution  and 
elimination in section 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to reflect values in relapsed/refractory ALL subjects 
regardless of the Philadelphia chromosome and across studies given that the values were comparable 
between the two subject populations. 
No new PD data were included in this submission, which is acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
As a result of the proposed extension of indication, section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated. Clinical 
pharmacology aspects are well described. No changes in sections 4.2 and 4.6 were based on 
pharmacokinetics. Proposed changes in section 5.2 are considered acceptable based on the data 
presented.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The purpose of this variation application is to extend the indication to include:  
- 
The treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed/refractory ALL who 
have  failed  treatment  with  at  least  2  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKIs)  and  have  no  alternative 
treatment options.  
- 
- 
The  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  Philadelphia-positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL  who  have 
failed treatment with at least 2 TKIs and have no alternative treatment options. 
The treatment of adult patients in first or second hematologic CR with Philadelphia-positive MRD-
positive ALL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 19/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy results are being presented for each of the three claimed extensions of indication 
A. The treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL who have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment options.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Treatment  effect  of  blinatumomab  in  adults  with  Philadelphia-positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL  was 
evaluated in Study 20120216. A fixed dose regimen (9-28 µg/day) was tested under cIV infusion over 4 
weeks  per  cycle  followed  by  a  2-week  drug-free  period  between  cycles.  In  this  study,  blinatumomab 
showed single-agent activity in subjects with Ph+ R/R ALL, predictable Css, and a manageable safety 
profile at a target dose of 28 μg/day. 
The regimen tested in subjects with Ph+ R/R ALL was the same regimen as that tested in subjects with 
Ph-  R/R  ALL  (Study  MT103-211  and  Study  00103311).  Step-dosing  was  included  for  management  of 
cytokine release syndrome events. The rationale for the clinical dose selection for the treatment of Ph+ 
R/R ALL was the same as that for the treatment of Ph- R/R ALL, as the pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab 
was not affected by the status of Philadelphia chromosome. 
In  Study  20120216,  the  mean  (SD)  blinatumomab  Css  values  at  9  and  28  µg/day  doses  during  cIV 
infusion in cycle 1 are provided in below, together with the mean (SD) Css values in studies MT103-211 
and 00103311 (Ph- R/R ALL).

Treatments 
A single cycle of blinatumomab was defined as 6 weeks in duration, which included 4 weeks of continuous 
intravenous (cIV) infusion of blinatumomab followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. 
A maximum of 5 cycles could be administered, in case of CR/CRh/Cri achieved within 2 induction cycles 
of treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 22/134 
 
 
  
  
In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab was 9 μg/day cIV infusion for the first 7 
days of treatment which was increased (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through 
day 29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle through 3 
consolidation cycles for applicable subjects), the administered dose was 28 μg/day throughout 4 weeks 
of continuous treatment. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Premedication with dexamethasone was intended to prevent or reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
events associated with blinatumomab treatment and was recommended as prephase therapy.  
Within 1 week (+ 3 days) before initiation of blinatumomab treatment and after each 
treatment cycle (after bone marrow aspiration on day 29), a mandatory central nervous system (CNS) 
prophylaxis  consisting  of  an  intrathecal  regimen  according  to  institutional  or  national  guidelines  was 
administered (e.g., methotrexate 12 to 15 mg, cytosine arabinoside 40 mg, and dexamethasone 4 mg 
or equivalent steroid dose). Central nervous system prophylaxis was omitted in case of anticipated safety 
risks caused by lumbar puncture during the treatment period of the study. 
The following medication and therapies were prohibited after blinatumomab treatment started (i.e., all 
other necessary supportive therapies were allowed): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
any antitumor therapy other than blinatumomab such as cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drugs, radiation 
therapy (except for palliative administration), immunotherapy 
chronic  systemic  high-dose  corticosteroid  therapy  (except  for  dexamethasone  as  given  as 
comedication) 
any other immunosuppressive therapies (except for transient use of corticosteroids) 
any other investigational medicinal product. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  rate  of  CR/complete  remission  with  partial  haematological 
recovery (CRh*) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory Ph-positive B-precursor ALL. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
to  evaluate  the  rate  of  MRD  remission  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  Ph-positive  B-
precursor ALL 
to evaluate other measures of efficacy of blinatumomab in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory 
Ph-positive B-precursor ALL 
to  estimate  the  safety  of  blinatumomab  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  Ph-positive  B-
precursor ALL 
to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of blinatumomab in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory Ph-
positive B-precursor ALL 
Exploratory Objective 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 23/134 
 
 
  
  
The  exploratory  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  blinatumomab  against  specific  bcr-abl 
mutations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved CR/CRh*. 
CR was defined as less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease and full 
recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets > 100,000/μl, and ANC > 1000/μl 
CRh was defined as less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease and 
partial recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets > 50,000/μl, and ANC > 500/μl. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were indicated as follows: 
- 
- 
rate of MRD remission within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab 
duration of CR or CRh* 
-  CR rate and CRh* rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab 
-  CR + CRh* + CRi rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab 
- 
- 
- 
- 
overall survival, from the date of the first dose of blinatumomab to the event/censor date 
allogeneic HSCT and 100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT 
incidence of adverse events and antibody formation 
PK parameters including quantification of serum blinatumomab concentrations 
The exploratory endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of blinatumomab in subjects with specific bcr-abl 
mutations. 
Subjects were evaluated for response/progression at the end of each cycle, and subsequently at least 
every 3 months. This is in line with the current clinical practice and overall acceptable. Bone marrow 
leukemic blast count was performed centrally, while peripheral blood blasts were evaluated locally. This 
is  acceptable,  yet  centralised  BM  evaluations  are  considered  of  primary  relevance  for  regulatory 
purposes.  MRD  evaluations  were  also  centralised,  and  the  selected  1x10-4  threshold  to  define  MRD 
response  is  in  accord  with  current  guidelines  (see  e.g.  Bruggermann  M  et  al,  Leukemia  2010)  and 
considered acceptable. 
Sample size 
Sample size estimation was based on the primary efficacy endpoint proportion of subjects who achieved 
a CR or CRh* within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. 
Simon mini-max 2-stage design (Simon, 1989) was used with a sample size (23 subjects in stage 1, 
41 evaluable subjects total) based on a 1-sided type 1 error of 0.025 and a power of 90% to detect 
the effective response rate assumption of ≥ 30% over an ineffective treatment rate of ≤ 10%. The 
study was planned to be stopped at stage 1 if fewer than 3 of 23 subjects were observed with CR or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 24/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
CRh* in stage 1. If at least 9 or more out of 41 subjects showed a CR or CRh* within 2 cycles of 
treatment with blinatumomab at the end of stage 2, the study’s assumption of ineffective treatment 
was rejected. 
Randomisation/Blinding 
Not Applicable as this is an open label, non-comparative study. 
Statistical methods 
The  safety  and  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  which  included  all 
subjects  who  received  an infusion  of  blinatumomab.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  subjects 
who met the definition of a prospectively defined per protocol set (PPS)  who did not have any major 
relevant protocol violations that affected the efficacy evaluation of the subject. 
Table 9: Summary of Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of subjects who achieved CR/CRh* within 
the first 2 cycles. The response assessments were performed at the end of each cycle. The best response 
within the first 2 cycles determined the primary efficacy endpoint.

A hypothesized null true response rate of 10% was tested against an alternative response rate of 30%. 
The planned sample size yielded a 1-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and power of 90% when the true 
response rate was at least 30%. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 61 subjects were screened and 45 subjects were enrolled in the study. All enrolled subjects 
received blinatumomab.  
A total of 39 subjects (86.7%) discontinued treatment with blinatumomab and the most common reason 
for  treatment  discontinuation  was  protocol-specified  criteria  (25  subjects  [55.6%]).  Eight  subjects 
(17.8%) completed the study and 37 subjects (82.2%) discontinued the study, all due to death.

Conduct of the study 
Study amendments 
Table 11: Protocol Amendment Summary Table 
At  time  of  amendment  2.0,  the  evaluation  of  the  duration  of  the  MRD  response  was  removed  from 
exploratory  endpoints.  Sensitivity  analyses  on  subjects  who  undergo  an  alloHSCT  based  on  MRD 
remission status prior to alloHSCT was also removed. The maximum duration for 5 cycles was added.  
Version 2.0 (dated 10 October 2014) of the SAP incorporated the changes from Protocol Amendment 2 
(dated 15 September 2014) to remove the exploratory endpoint of duration of MRD response, and to 
further clarify the analysis details. No specific changes were made to the protocol-specified analyses.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Best Response Within First 2 Cycles 
In the FAS, 35.6% subjects (95% CI: 21.9%, 51.2%) achieved a CR/CRh* within the first 2 cycles of 
blinatumomab treatment. The 95% CI of the CR/CRh* rate excludes the ineffective treatment rate of 
10% that was the basis of the null hypothesis. 
The study treatment period of blinatumomab included 2 induction cycles and up to 3 consolidation cycles. 
Seventeen  subjects  (37.8%  FAS;  41.5%  PPS)  achieved  a  CR/CRh*  during  the  treatment  period;  1 
additional achieved a CR/CRh* after the first 2 cycles. Two additional subjects converted to CR during 
subsequent cycles of blinatumomab: 1 subject with a CRh* and 1 subject with a CRi after 2 cycles.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
o  Minimal Residual Disease Response During the First 2 Cycles 
An MRD response was observed in 18 subjects (40%) in the FAS and all of them were complete responses 
(undetectable disease at an assay sensitivity level of at least 10-4). 
Of the 16 subjects with a best response of CR/CRh* after 2 cycles, 14 subjects (87.5%; 95% CI: 61.7%, 
98.4%) achieved a complete MRD response: 12 subjects with a CR (85.7%, 12/14) and 2 subjects with 
a CRh*(100.0%, 2/2). 
Four (4) additional subjects achieved complete MRD responses: 1 subject with a CRi and 3 subjects with 
blast-free hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow. 
o  Relapse-free Survival 
Of the 16 subjects with a best response of CR/CRh* after 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment, 5 subjects 
(31.3%) were relapse free at the time of last response evaluation. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  estimate  of  median  relapse-free  survival  was  6.8  months  (95%  CI:  4.4,  not 
estimable [NE]).

The KM estimate of median time to haematological relapse (duration of response) for the 16 subjects 
with CR/CRh* was 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.5, NE). The median time to haematological relapse was the 
same (6.8 months [95% CI: 3.8, NE]) in subjects with CR/CRh*/CRi. The KM plot for duration of response

Anti-blinatumomab-binding antibody was evaluated with a validated blinatumomab anti-drug antibody 
assay with the electrochemiluminescence detection technology. Paired samples from pre- and post-dose 
were  available  for  31  subjects.  All  the  samples  were  classified  as  negative  for  the  presence  of  anti-
blinatumomab antibodies. 
Historical control study 20160462 
Study 20160462 was a retrospective cohort study of salvage treatment outcomes among adult patients 
with  relapsed  or  refractory  philadelphia-chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  B-precursor  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL). 
Methods 
This was a retrospective cohort study of historical data from adult patients with Ph+ R/R B-precursor 
ALL  who  received  current  standard  of  care  treatment  and  had  failed/intolerant  or  R/R  to  second 
generation TKI for ALL. 
The  retrospective  cohort  of  patients  was  identified  and  developed  from  existing  clinical  databases 
collected  for  3  ALL  study  groups;  1  in  Spain  and  2  in  Italy  (University  of  Milan;  Institut  Català 
d'Oncologia; and University of Bologna, S. Orsola University Hospital).  
The period of eligibility for the diagnosis and eligibility of patients into the study was from 2000 through 
end of data collection in 2017. 
The baseline period started from the initial diagnosis of ALL and ended at the start of the first qualifying 
salvage  therapy.  Data  on  patients  were  collected  starting  with  the  diagnosis  of  ALL  until  the  date  of 
death  or  last  follow-up  as  of  the  date  of  data  collection.  For  time-to-event  analyses,  patients  were 
followed to the event or censored at the time they were lost to follow-up or were alive at the end of 
study.

•  Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
-  CR  was  defined  as  ≤  5%  blasts  in  the  bone  marrow,  no  evidence  of  disease,  and  full  recovery  of 
peripheral blood counts (platelets > 100 000/µL and absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 1000/µL) 
-  CRh* defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of 
peripheral blood counts (platelets > 50 000/µL and ANC > 500/µL)

•  Sample size 
Assuming the formula 1.96 × 0.5/(sample size)½ represents a reasonable approximation for the half-
width of a 95% CI, the expected precision of the CR proportion estimate is +/- 13.9% for 50 patients 
and +/- 9.8% for 100 patients. Approximately 50 to 100 patients from Italy and Spain were identified 
to be available for this study. 
•  Statistical methods 
For  the  primary  objective,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  CR  (CR,  CRh*,  CRi,  and  combinations  of 
these) was estimated along with the asymptotic variance and 95% CI.  
For the secondary objectives, KM OS rates at selected times after salvage therapy (6 months, 1 year, 
and 2 years) and the median OS was estimated. For KM rates, the variance and 95% CI was estimated 
using  Greenwood’s  formula.  For  the  median  OS,  the  variance  and  95%  CI  was  estimated  using  the 
method described in Collett, 1994. 
The RFS was estimated using the same methods as those for OS. The proportion of patients achieving 
an MRD response and receiving HSCT was estimated along with the asymptotic variance and 95% CI.  
Overall  estimates  of  the  study  outcomes  were  described  for  the  unadjusted  study  population,  and 
weighted to match key patient and disease characteristics (eg, disease status, previous treatments) in 
the ALCANTARA (20120216) clinical study. The proportions across strata based on the key patient and 
disease characteristics were pooled into a combined estimate with each stratum weight matching the 
Assessment report

percentage  of  patients  observed  in  that  stratum  from  the  20120216  clinical  study.  A  95%  CI  was 
estimated for the combined estimate with variance based on the sum of the variances of the weighted 
stratum proportions. Propensity score modelling will be conducted to estimate the association between 
receipt of blinatumomab (versus the qualifying salvage therapy) and CR and OS outcomes, by adjusting 
with inverse probability of treatment weighting. 
No stratified analyses were planned for this study. 
Sensitivity  analysis  for  residual  confounding  and  bias:  A  sensitivity  analysis  compared  certain 
characteristics of this study population such as age at relapse, sex, and previous treatments with the 
patients  in  the  ALCANTARA  study  to  assess  potential  bias  and  residual  confounding.  Relationships 
between important clinical and other characteristics and study endpoints were examined to understand 
their potential as confounders in this study population, and controlled for when necessary. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 55 patients was included. 
Approximately 75.0% of patients with data available were from the 2 sites in Italy; 25,5% of patients 
were from the third site, in spain. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Start of data collection: 01 August 2017 
End of data collection: 31 December 2017 
Final report of study results: 12 April 2018 
One amendment was implement, on 22 June 2017. The purpose of this amendment was to update the 
study end date to clarify that the observation period is prior to the date of inclusion of patients in the 
study  and  that  no  additional  prospective  data  will  be  collected  from  the  sites  after  the  date  of  data 
collection. 
•  Baseline characteristics 
The study had an equal distribution of men (51%) and women (49%). 
The median (min, max) age at diagnosis was 50.0 (19.0, 81.0) years and the median (min, max) age 
at last qualifying salvage therapy was 53.0 (20.0, 82.0) years. Approximately 40.0% patients were 55 
years or older at diagnosis or at treatment. 
Baseline disease characteristics are summarized in the table below.

A total of 33 patients (63.5%) died (censored at HSCT) (Table 28). The KM-estimated median time to 
hematological  OS  events  (censored  at  HSCT)  was  5.5  (95%  CI: 4.4,  7.6)  months.  The  KM-estimated

o  Relapse-free Survival 
Strata-specific (unweighted) estimates of median RFS were not estimable because of limited number of 
events that occurred by the last follow-up (n = 2). The combined KM-estimated 6-month RFS rate could 
not be weighted to the population in Study 20120216. The KM plot for RFS is shown in the figure below. 
o  Other analysis 
OS subgroup analysis:  
Subgroup analysis of OS was provided for each baseline characteristics. This analysis suggested that the 
KM-estimated 6-month (59.0%) and 12-month (45.0%) OS was higher in patients who received previous 
allogeneic HSCT compared with patients who received salvage therapy without previous allogeneic HSCT 
(44.0% and 18.0%, respectively).  
Patients who were not refractory to any previous treatment appeared to have longer OS than patients 
who were refractory to any previous treatment. Younger age at treatment suggested a trend of lower 
OS. Chemotherapy plus TKI as last salvage therapy suggested longer OS. 
The hazard ratio (HR) (patients who received allogeneic HSCT after salvage therapy versus patients who 
did not receive allogeneic HSCT after salvage therapy) for OS adjusted for age, WBC count at diagnosis, 
and year of diagnosis including CR + CRh* status after salvage therapy was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.06, 1.67)

Hematological Overall Survival Analysis:  
A  total  of  33  patients  (63.5%)  died  (censored  at  HSCT).  The  KM-estimated  median  time  to 
haematological OS events (censored at HSCT) was 5.5 (95% CI: 4.4, 7.6) months. The KM-estimated 
haematological OS at 18 months (censored at HSCT) was 14.0% (95% CI: 2.0%, 26.0%). 
Hematological Relapse-free Survival Analysis: One patient (8.3%) had haematological relapse (censored 
at HSCT) after achieving a CR. The KM-estimated median time to haematological RFS events was not 
reached. The KM-estimated haematological RFS at 18 months (censored at HSCT) was 83.0% (95% CI: 
54.0%, 100%).

Ancillary analyses 
Propensity Score Analysis 
A Propensity Score Analysis was performed to estimate the association between receipt of 
blinatumomab (versus the qualifying salvage therapy) and OS and CR/CRh* outcomes among patients 
with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory ALL, with a comparison to historical cohort 20160462. 
In an attempt to create a balance between the 2 groups of data with respect to key prognostic factors, 
a propensity score analysis was completed. 
Primary objective of the Propensity Score Analysis was:  
- 
Evaluate the effect of blinatumomab, with OS comparison between adult subjects with Phi + RR ALL 
from Study 20120216 receiving blinatumomab and patients from Study 20160462 receiving standard 
of  care  treatment;  comparison  was  performed  after  OS  adjustments  for  each  study  patient’s 
propensity score. 
Secondary objective of the Propensity Score Analysis was:  
- 
To evaluate the effect of blinatumomab with respect to CR/CRh* rate after making adjustments for 
each study patient’s propensity score. 
Overall  survival  was  aligned  between  Study  20120216  and  Study  20160462  while  CR/CRh*  was 
determined  with  the  first  2  cycles  of  blinatumomab  treatment  for  Study  21020216  while  in  Study 
20160462 the time to response was not specified in the protocol (mean of 133 days with standard error 
of 41 and a median of 48 days). 
In  order  to  meet  these  objectives,  adequate  balance  had  to  be  achieved  between  this  historical 
comparator population and the Study 20120216 clinical trial population.  
Methods 
The propensity score analysis included subjects from the Full Analysis sets for Studies 20120216 and 
20160462, and only included patients from 20160462 which met the primary entry criteria for 20120216. 
Balance between 20120216 population and 20160462 was obtained by applying inverse probability of 
treatment weights (IPTW) calculated from a propensity score model. 
Four common approaches for making propensity score adjustments include 1) stratification, 2) covariate 
adjustment, 3) matching, and 4) inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). With time-to-event 
endpoints,  stratification  and  covariate  adjustment  have  been  shown  to  produce  biased  estimates  of 
marginal and conditional hazard ratios (Austin, 2013; Austin et al, 2007). Therefore, given that OS has 
been designated as the primary endpoint, only matching and IPTW could be considered for this analysis. 
However, a limitation of matching is that it can require large sample sizes if the degree of propensity 
score overlap is limited and many patients need to be dropped from the analysis due to an inability to 
find  a  proper  match  within  the  pre-specified  caliper  bounds.  Given  the  limited  sample  size  of  the 
blinatumomab treatment group, matching was not considered viable for propensity score adjustments. 
Therefore, IPTW was used for propensity score adjustments in this analysis. 
Due to the low sample size a limited number of covariates were selected for the propensity score model 
(number of salvage therapies and no prior salvage). Moreover, because of the relatively small sample 
size  (combined  N=100)  and  low  power  for  identifying  influential  covariates,  p<0.30  was  used  as  the 
threshold for entering and keeping covariates in the model.

Although 100% of the propensity scores for the historical comparator were contained within the 95% 
range  of  the  propensity  scores  for  blinatumomab,  the  historical  comparator  data  was  not  evenly 
distributed over the range of scores for blinatumomab. Balance was assessed based on overlap of the 
propensity  score  values  and  standardized  differences  of  the  individual  baseline  covariates  before  and 
after IPTW adjustment.  
Upon deriving propensity scores for each patient, balance between the two treatment groups with respect 
to their PS was assessed via box plots. The overall balance was to be considered sufficient if at least 
25% of the control data overlapped with the inner 95th percentile of the blinatumomab data, as pre-
specified in the SSAP. 
Given the relative small sample size of Study 20160462 and Study 20120216, and reasonable estimates 
of the blinatumomab treatment effect the comparisons of OS and CR/CRh* were not sufficiently powered 
(< 80%). To account for this, a Bayesian augmentation approach was applied to the endpoint analyses 
in which prior distributions for the comparison parameters (ie, the hazard ratio, and odds ratio) were 
specified and parameterized using key efficacy outcomes from the randomized trial in adult Philadelphia-
negative relapsed/refractory subjects, Study 00103311. The variance of the priors determine the amount 
of  “borrowing”  that  occurred  from  the  prior  models  and  were  selected  to  provide  80%  power  for  the 
comparisons. Potential bias from this “borrowing” was assessed using sensitivity analyses at lower power 
levels and were provided in addition to the analysis without Bayesian augmentation. 
With and without the Bayesian augmentation, the effect of treatment on OS  was modelled using Cox 
Proportional Hazards model and CR/CRh* was modelled using a Logistic generalized linear model. Robust 
variance  estimates  with  their  respective  CIs  were  provided  for  non-Bayesian  analyses.  For  Bayesian 
models, point estimates and 95% CI were estimated using summary statistics and the relative highest 
posterior density interval of the posterior distributions and for model parameters of interest. 
Table 31: Covariant Balance for Unadjusted and Adjusted Factors - Propensity Score Analysis Subjects and 
Patients 
The  primary  null  hypothesis  tested  for  this  analysis  was  that  blinatumomab  has  no  effect  on  OS  as 
compared to historical controls.

Overall  survival  was  calculated  relative  to  the  start  date  of  blinatumomab  infusion/standard  of  care 
treatment in the first treatment cycle. All deaths were counted as events on the date of death. Patients 
alive  were  censored  on  the  last  known  date  that  they  were  alive.  The  PS-weighted  OS  analysis  was 
performed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with  each  patient’s  treatment  status  as  an 
independent factor. 
Results 
•  Primary Endpoint: OS 
The  Bayes-augmented  IPTW  adjusted  hazard  ratio  comparing  blinatumomab  to  historical  comparator 
was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.96) representing 23% reduction in the hazard of death for the blinatumomab 
treatment group compared to the historical control group. For comparison, the non-Bayes IPTW adjusted 
hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.15). 
Due  to  the  inclusion  of  prior  HSCT  in  the  endpoint  model,  survival  curves  and  point  estimates  are 
calculated given the proportion of prior HSCT: 0.327 for historical control and 0.4 for blinatumomab. The 
Bayesian-augmented survival for blinatumomab subjects at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months is provided in the 
table below. Nine-month survival curves are shown in the figure below.

•  Time to all 3 subcategories of CR and time to CRc, CR*, CR3.  
•  100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT 
•  Duration of Patient Participation/Duration of the Study 
Each patient participated for up to 34 weeks in the core study including: 
- A screening period of up to 2 weeks 
- A treatment period of up to 30 weeks consisting of up to 5 consecutive cycles of 6 weeks each 
- An End of Core Study visit 30 days after last dose of study medication. 
Following the last treatment cycle all patients were followed for efficacy and survival at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 
and 24 months after treatment start. Patients who discontinued treatment prior to completion of 5 cycles 
of blinatumomab entered immediately the follow-up study period. 
The core study lasted for up to 44 months including the recruitment for the Phase I part of the study (24 
months)  and  recruitment  for  the  Phase  II  part  of  the  study  (12  months).  The  primary  endpoint  was 
assessed approximately 3 months after enrolment of the last patient. The end of the trial was defined 
as the last protocol mandated evaluation for the last patient in the study. 
Results 
Data and discussion are focussed on Phi + patients from study MT103 205. 
Efficacy data are provided for 3 paediatric subjects with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL 
from Study MT103 205. 
All 3 subjects were heavily pre-treated and received an allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated donor. Two 
subjects received the registrational dose of 5-15 μg/m2/day blinatumomab, and 1 subject received 15 
μg/m2/day  blinatumomab.  Two  of  the  3  paediatric  subjects  achieved  a  best  response  of  CR  with  full 
recovery of peripheral blood counts, while 1 subject had no response to treatment. 
C. Adult patients in first or second hematologic CR with Philadelphia-
positive MRD-positive ALL 
Data in adult subjects in hematologic CR with Philadelphia-positive MRD-positive ALL are retrieved from 
the MRD-positive ALL studies MT103-203 and MT103-202. 
Study MT103-203 is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study in subjects ≥ 18 years of age 
whose MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL was in CR as defined by less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow 
after at least 3 intense chemotherapy blocks (N = 116).  
Study  MT103-202  was  an  exploratory,  open-label,  multicenter,  single-arm,  phase  2  study  in  adult 
subjects with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL. Subjects were ≥ 18 years of age and were in complete

hematologic remission with molecular failure or molecular relapse starting any time after consolidation 
I of front-line therapy (after at least 3 intense chemotherapy blocks) with GMALL standards or any time 
outside GMALL standards (N = 21). 
MRD response was the primary endpoint in both the MT103-202 and MT103-203 studies. Complete MRD 
response rate was chosen as the primary endpoint to describe the efficacy of blinatumomab in subjects 
with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL.  
The numbers of Philadelphia-positive subjects in both studies was small: a total of 10 subjects (MT103-
202,  n  =  5;  MT103-203,  n  =  5).  In  Study  MT103-203,  subjects  with  Philadelphia-positive  ALL  were 
excluded from the study if they were eligible for treatment with TKIs (ie, Philadelphia-positive subjects 
with  no  documented  treatment  failure  of  or  intolerance/contraindication  to  at  least  2  TKIs).  In  Study 
MT103-202,  TKIs  registered  for  treatment  of  bcr-abl–positive  B-lineage  ALL  were  permitted  as 
concomitant treatment. 
Subpopulation  analyses  for  the  combined  data  from  Studies  MT103-202  and  MT103-203  had  been 
provided in this prior variation. These analysis, extracted from this prior variation, are summarized in 
tables below. 
The majority of subjects had an MRD complete response regardless of Philadelphia chromosome 
status: 87% (107 of 123) of Philadelphia-negative subjects and 70.0% (7 of 10) of Philadelphia-
positive subjects. 
Median RFS (95% CI) was 6.2 months (0.7 to NE) for subjects who were Philadelphia-positive compared 
with 22.3 months (15.4 to 50.8) for subjects who were Philadelphia-negative; Kaplan-Meier estimates 
(95%  CI)  at  18  months  were  40%  (95%  CI:  12%  to  67%)  and  57%  (95%  CI:  48%  to  66%), 
respectively). 
Duration  of  hematologic  remission  was  44.3  months  (2.1  to  NE)  and  NE  (25.1  to  NE),  respectively; 
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  (95%  CI)  at  18  months  were  56%  (20%  to  80%)  and  68%  (59%  to  76%), 
respectively.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Discussion on clinical efficacy is presented for each of the claimed indications

positive relapsed/refractory ALL who have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment options.

This extension is based on the results of a complete phase 2, single-arm study (Study 20120216). A 
historical control study (Study 20160462) and a propensity score analysis were conducted to estimate 
the effects of blinatumomab compared with standard of care ALL therapy for treatment of Philadelphia-
positive relapsed/refractory ALL. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main pivotal study 20120216 is a Phase 2 Single Arm, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
the BiTE® Antibody Blinatumomab in Adult Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Philadelphia Positive B-
precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Alcantara Study). 
Eligible  adult  subjects  for  this  study  should  have  Phi  +  B-precursor  ALL,  relapsed  or  refractory  after 
second generation (G2) TKI, or intolerant to G2 TKI and refractory to G1 TKI. Patients should not be 
eligible for alloHSCT at the time of enrollment. The target indication specifies that patients should have 
“no alternative treatment option”. One could consider that illegibility to alloHSCT should be accurately 
specified in the indication. However, this is covered by the proposed indication, as part of alternative 
treatment options. Further, it is noted that the population targeted by the claimed indication is stricter 
than the studied population, which also includes subjects who had failed one single second generation 
TKI: the inclusion of less pre-treated patients in study 20120216 questions the generalizability of the 
results  to  the  targeted  later  line  of  therapy.  Further,  resistance  to  TKIs  is  mainly  driven  by  point 
mutations  within  the  ABL  kinase  domain.  and  the  choice  of  TKI  is  then  usually  guided  by  mutational 
analysis, with the aim of maximizing responses. In this regard, no mutational analysis was required to 
assess  eligibility  to  study  20120216,  so  it  is  unclear  whether  patients  in  study  20120216  can  be 
considered  representative  of  a  population  with  no  alternative  options,  as  per  the  claimed  indication. 
Eligibility for allogeneic HSCT was also considered an exclusion criteria, yet. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses, study 20120216:   
A total of 45 patients were included (FAS). Only 6 of them could complete the end of the consolidation 
phase  (13.3%),  and  8  patients  completed  the  study  (17.8%).  Most  of  patients  (n=37;  82.2%) 
discontinued study, all due to death. However, only 3 patients discontinued the treatment due to death. 
Most of treatment discontinuations were due to progression without prior CR/CRh/Cri (n=12), followed 
by requirement for alternative therapy (n=7) and intention to receive HSCT (n=6).  
The study included patients with chromosome Phi detected (100%), by cytogenetics, FISK and/or PCR. 
To be noted, 35.6% of patients had Phi only, while 48.9% had Phi and other cytogenetics abnormalities.  
Study population was almost balanced between men and women (53.5% vs 46.5%), with a mean age 
of 52.8 years. Most of subjects were ECOG 1 (35.6%) or 2 (44.4%).   
As per inclusion criteria, all patients had received prior TKI, and most of patients had received at least 2 
or more prior TKI (46.7% with 2 TKIs). However, it should be noted that 7 patients (15.6%) had only 
received 1 prior TKI, which is earlier than the target indication limited to at least 2 prior TKIs. Most of 
included patients were in first (55.6%) or 2nd relapse (28.9%). However, 3 patients had no prior relapse. 
A higher proportion of patients had no prior HSCT (55.5%). Thus, as per ESMO guidelines, subjects meet 
high risk factors such as age, ECOG 2 (44.4%), pro B Phi + (100%) and BCR ABL1 (25%). 
Historical control study, Study 20160462 
Study 20160462 was a retrospective cohort study of salvage treatment outcomes among adult patients 
with  relapsed  or  refractory  philadelphia-chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  B-precursor  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL). The objective was to estimate the proportion of adult patients with R/R Ph+ B-precursor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 67/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
ALL who achieve a CR (eg, CR, CR with partial haematological recovery [CRh*], or complete response 
with  incomplete haematological  recovery  [CRi])  after  salvage  therapy.  Study 20160462  only  included 
patients  who  meet  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  study  20120216  so  that  the  key  study 
endpoints could be summarized to provide a historical context to the blinatumomab efficacy results from 
the 20120216 study. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria did not automatically create a balance 
between the 2 groups of data with respect to key prognostic factors. 
A Propensity Score Analysis was performed to estimate the association between receipt of blinatumomab 
in  study  20120216  (versus  the  qualifying  salvage  therapy  in  study  20160462)  and  OS  and  CR/CRh* 
outcomes among patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory ALL 
During  the  initial  assessment  limitations  due  to  non-comparative  study  design  and  limited  historical 
cohort were highlighted. Moreover, the absence of improvement of OS while HSCT is not censored was 
of concern. To be noted, all 4 patients who received HSCT without additional treatment had died at 17 
months.  The  clinical  relevance  of  efficacy  results obtained  with  blinatumomab  in the  target indication 
were further discussed during the assessment rounds.  
The following limitations should be highlighted:  
•  Non-comparative design of the pivotal study; 
•  Despite attempts to implement a comparative historical cohort, samples were too limited to allow a 
robust propensity score analysis, and non-negligible deviations and missing data were observed;  
•  Covariates for the propensity analysis were limited to number of salvage therapies, no prior salvage 
and prior HSCT 
•  Additional  extrapolation  was  necessary,  with  a  Bayesian  augmentation  approach,  due  to  limited 
available data; The Bayesian approach was based on a previous study (00103311), in a different 
population  (Phi  neg  patients),  with  the  hypothesis  that  data  from  this  study  00103311  could  be 
extrapolated to studies 20120216 and 20160462. 
The pivotal study 20120216, carried out on 45 patients, evidenced a CR/CRh rate of 35.6%; [21.9%, 
51.2%]) within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment, a median RFS of 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.4, 
NE) and a median OS of 9.0 months (95% CI: 5.7, 13.5). However, no difference in OS results in the 
pivotal study was observed with or without censoring at time of HSCT. The absence of improvement of 
OS while HSCT is not censored, and the risk of detrimental long term effect of blinatumomab treatment 
on OS after HSCT remain an uncertainty. Moreover, it should be noted that all 4 patients who received 
HSCT  without  additional  treatment,  had  died  at  17  months.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  the  historical 
control  cohort,  a  total  of  8  patients  received  alloHSCT  after  qualifying  salvage  therapy.  Median  OS, 
uncensored at HSCT, was 6.0 months (4.4; 9.2), and median OS, censored at HSCT, was similar (5.5 
months [4.4; 7.6]). Adjusted HR (with or without alloHSCT after qualifying salvage therapy) for OS was 
0.32 (95% CI: 0.06, 1.67).  
The propensity score analysis showed a trend in increasing OS with blinatumomab treatment in RR Phi 
+  ALL  patients,  when  compared  to  historical  cohort  study,  with  a  Bayes-augmented  adjusted  hazard 
ratio of  0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.96). No significant difference in CR/CRh was evidenced.  
The  MAH  provided  a  discussion  on  limitations  of  the  propensity  score  analysis  and  Bayesian 
augmentation. 
One can only consider in the propensity score model covariates that are measured adequately in each 
study.  Therefore,  unlike  with  randomized  studies,  the  analysis  does  not  have  the  ability  to  create  a 
balance between treatment groups with respect to all covariates (including unmeasured and unknown 
covariates). For example, potentially important baseline covariates such as bone marrow blast counts 
and peripheral blood counts were not available in the external data. However unless these covariates 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 68/134 
 
 
  
  
are extremely strong prognostic factors, they should not influence the overall results and conclusions of 
this analysis. 
An underlying assumption of the propensity score analysis is that the overall treatment management of 
relapsed/refractory Philadelphia-positive ALL (after failure of at least one second generation TKI) during 
the timeframe of the external data is represented by the 55 standard of care subjects available for this 
analysis. In this analysis, the distribution of baseline dates for control patients overlaps with that for the 
blinatumomab  subjects.  Treatments  have  not  dramatically  changed  during  the  external  control  study 
period. Chemotherapy with or without TKIs and HSCT remained the primary treatment options available. 
Currently,  the  only  new  therapies  for  Philadelphia-positive  ALL  are  inotuzumab  and  tisagenlecleucel 
which were not available at the time this trial was conducted. 
Due to the limited sample sizes in each of the datasets there may be insufficient power to detect clinically 
meaningful  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  even  with  Bayesian  augmentation.  With  the 
Bayesian augmentation, statistically significant results were observed for OS. This significance was not 
present without this augmentation in OS, and not present even with augmentation for CR/CRh*. However 
point  estimates  for  the  effects  of  both  OS  and  CR/CRh*  were  fairly  consistent  across  all  sensitivity 
analyses. Even with augmentation, this analysis assumes that the limited dataset is representative of 
the overall treatment populations. 
The completeness and quality of the historical data is unlikely to be as good as that of the clinical trial 
data. 
One of the most important assumptions for conducting the Bayesian analysis to borrow information is 
the exchangeability between Study 00103311 population and the combined 020120216 and 20160462 
study  population.  If  this  assumption  does  not  hold,  the  results  can  be  misleading.  However,  the 
assumption  of  exchangeability  is  considered  to  hold  well  in  this  context.  Although  Study  00103311 
evaluated  Philadelphia-negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  subjects,  it  evaluated  subjects  who  already 
failed other available therapies for relapsed/refractory ALL, and who, from a clinical perspective, have a 
poor prognosis comparable to relapsed/refractory patients with Philadelphia-positive status. Also, both 
Philadelphia-negative and Philadelphia-positive leukemic cells express CD19 therefore blinatumomab’s 
mechanism of action does not depend on a subject’s Philadelphia chromosome status. 
P-values  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are  not  presented  because  the 
interpretation of those p-values would be difficult in light of the aforementioned limitations. Additionally, 
there are multiple analyses being conducted without adjustments for multiplicity. Rather, the 95% CIs 
are intended act as “goal posts” for statistical significance as is the body of evidence among all analyses 
conducted (ie, overall and sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints). Philadelphia-
positive patients are a rare subset of refractory ALL. Both Philadelphia-positive and Philadelphia-negative 
patients treated with blinatumomab in these studies have failed other therapies and have poor prognosis 
and both are expected to respond similarly to treatment with blinatumomab. 
The difficulty to conduct randomized comparative trials was acknowledged, as well as the acceptability 
of historical comparative cohort. The MAH provided a comparison of results between studies carried in 
Phi  +  and  Phi  –  patients.  Based  on  ESMO  guidelines,  Ph+  ALL  patients  are  considered  as  high  risk 
patients.  Despite  similar  clinical  manifestations,  considering  differences  in  prognosis  and  treatment, 
comparison between Phi + and Phi – ALL remained uncertain. 
Despite methodological limitations of these data, clinical relevance of results obtained in Phi + RR ALL 
patients, after at least 2 TKI treatments, was endorsed in these patients without alternative treatment, 
with CR rate of 35.6% (16/45) [21.9% to 51.2%], including 14 MRD response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 69/134 
 
 
  
  
 
A durable response was obtained, with OS of 7.1 months 95% (CI: 5.6 months to NE). At time of the 
last follow-up date, 8 of 45 subjects (17.8%) were alive (including 5 from patients in CR).  
Similar trends were observed when comparing results obtained in Phi – patients, but low comparability 
of these two populations should be kept in mind.  
The above data are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC ….  
•  The 
treatment  as  monotherapy  of  paediatric  patients  with  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL who have failed treatment with at least 2 TKIs and have no alternative 
treatment options. 
The MAH based the request for extension of indication to Phi + RR ALL paediatric patients, with a least 
2 prior TKIs, on 3 paediatric subjects with Phi + RR ALL  from Study MT103 205 on the basis of data   
from a previous submission (EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018). No dedicated subgroup analysis on Phi 
+  patients  was  available  in  CSR  for  study  MT103 205.  All  3  subjects  were  heavily  pre-treated  and 
received an allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated donor. Two subjects received the registrational dose of 
5-15  μg/m2/day  blinatumomab,  and  1  subject  received  15  μg/m2/day  blinatumomab.  Two  of  the  3 
paediatric subjects achieved a best response of CR with full recovery of peripheral blood counts, while 1 
subject had no response to treatment. 
The MAH provided detailed individual case data regarding the 3 paediatric patients from study MT103-
205.  These  data  were  complemented  with  3  paediatric  cases  from  study  20130320  and  2  paediatric 
cases from study 20160441.  Globally, 3/8 paediatric subjects reached CR, all with MRD negative after 
2 cycles, and 2/8 reached CR without complete hematologic remission. Four (4) out of these 8 patients 
went to aHSCT. 
Three (3) patients died from ALL progression, 4 died from other reason (one each liver failure due to 
adenovirus  infection  post aHSCT,  fatal  septic  shock,  multi  organ  failure  and  pulmonary  aspergillosis), 
and 1 remained alive at time of last FU. 
However, it should be highlighted that among these 8 patients, only 2 fulfilled the target indication, with 
at least 2 prior TKIs, including one non responder and 1 patient in CR; Both patients were included in 
study MT103-205. 
In support of the claimed extension of indication, the MAH attempted an extrapolation from Phi - to Phi 
+  patients.  Despite  similar  presentation  in  Phi  +  and  Phi  –  ALL  patients,  poorer  prognosis  in  Phi  + 
patients remains and outcomes are not truly comparable. Thus this extrapolation is not fully supported. 
Similar trends in CR rates would not fully support extrapolation from adult to pediatric populations (see 
also considerations under Clinical Pharmacology). As previously highlighted and acknowledged by the 
applicant, only 2 pediatric patients are covered by the target indication (after at least 2 prior TKIs); only 
one of them presented with a CR. Thus the CR rate results would be impossible to interpret  due to low 
numbers and thus imprecision and wide CI.  
The applicant provided also a Bayesian extrapolation from adult to pediatric patients. This approach is 
interesting but not adequate for this situation. The model is based on adult patients and does not provide 
further certainties in the pediatric population. In the 3 tested models, the 8 pediatric patients were added 
to the adult population.  
The applicant provided also additional data from isolated patients, outside of any clinical study (3 patients 
from an academic center in Italy, 6 pediatric patients in expanded access setting, and 2 literature cases, 
with data provided via personal communication with the treating physicians). Despite encouraging data 
in these patients in CR, no conclusion could be drawn.  
The results observed in younger subjects treated in pivotal study 20120216 are not encouraging (none 
of the 5 patients aged ≥ 18 and <35 years achieved CR with blinatumomab, with a median OS of just 6

months). Despite no CR observed in these 5 patients, 2 patients achieved blast-free hypocellular bone 
marrow and complete MRD responses within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment.  
As a conclusion, these results remain insufficient to justify this extension of indication in Phi + RR ALL 
pediatric patients. The MAH has agreed not to further pursue this indication. 
. 
•  The  treatment  of  adult  patients  in  first  or  second  hematologic  CR  with  Philadelphia-positive 
MRD-positive ALL.  
The claimed indication is based on a very limited sample size of 10 patients, pooled from two different 
studies in MRD-positive ALL: studies MT103-203 (n=5) and MT103-202 (n=5). 
The MAH provided a very limited discussion on efficacy of blinatumomab in adult patients in hematologic 
CR with Philadelphia-positive ALL who have MRD.  
Data provided in this variation do not allow sufficient discussion or comparison between both studies to 
ensure comparability of pooled subjects in terms of baselines and study method (i.e. selection criteria, 
MRD thresholds …). Moreover, no discussion on the robustness of these data for the extrapolation to 
larger MRD+, Phi +, population was provided. 
In  Study  MT103-203,  MRD  CR  was  achieved  within  the  first  cycle  in  77.9%  (95%  CI:  69.1,  85.1)  of 
subjects. In the subgroup of Phi + patients, MRD CR was reached in 60% of patients [14.7; 94.7]. 
In Study MT103-202, MRD CR was achieved within the first cycle in 80% (16/20; 95% CI: 56.3, 94.3) 
of subjects. In the subgroup of Phi + patients, MRD CR was reached in 80% of patients [28.4; 99.5]. 
Once studies MT103-203 and MT103-202 pooled, median RFS (95% CI) in Phi + subjects was clearly 
shorter for MRD Phi+ patients (6.2 months (0.7 to NE)) than for MRD Phi neg patients (22.3 months 
(15.4 to 50.8)).  
The MAH concluded that in summary, the majority of subjects in the MRD-positive ALL studies had a 
complete  MRD  response  regardless  of  Philadelphia  chromosome  status.  Median  RFS  and  duration  of 
hematologic  remission  in  Studies  MT103-202  and  MT103-203  were  shorter  in  subjects  who  were 
Philadelphia-positive,  which  is  associated  with  a  worse  prognosis,  compared  with  those  who  were 
Philadelphia-negative;  however,  95%  CIs  were  overlapping  even  though  the  number  of  Philadelphia-
positive subjects included in the studies was small. 
Despite a similar trend in MRD CRs between Phi +/Phi neg MRD ALL subjects, these RFS results sharply 
shorter in MRD Phi + patients question on the duration of the effect in Phi + patients, even if studies 
were not powered for comparison. No further conclusion could be drawn from duration of hematologic 
remission. No discussion on HSCT after blinatumomab treatment in these 10 patients was provided in 
the variation. 
Overall,  “extrapolation”  of  the  efficacy  observed  in  the  Ph-  setting  is  hardly  appropriate,  due  to 
differences in post-remission treatment standards, disease biology and observed extent of benefit (in 
particular with respect to the shorter median DoR in Ph+ ALL patients). Further, in study MT103-202 
concomitant use of TKIs was allowed, and no data have been provided on how many subjects received 
combination (i.e. blinatumomab + TKI) therapy. 
In order to complete results, the applicant provided CR/CRh duration in patients with MRD response in 
ALCANTARA  study  (20120216).  However,  these  results  do  not  reflect  the  targeted  indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 71/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
ALCANTARA study included adult RR Phi + ALL patients, while MRD extension in Phi + patients concerns 
adult  Phi  +  ALL  patients  in  CR  with  MRD.  Thus  the  duration  of  response  in  RR  patients  who  reached 
CR/CRh does not reflect the duration of MRD negativity in MRD patients, not yet in RR. 
Based on previously authorized indication in Phi – MRD patients, the applicant kept the target indication 
unchanged, without specifying prior TKI treatment nor the absence of data in MRD patients without prior 
allo HSCT.  
An  approach  to  further  support  an  extrapolation  of  the  indication  (from  Philadelphia  negative  to 
Philadelphia  positive)  in  the  adults  by  providing  additional  PK  data  was  proposed  by  the  applicant 
referring to the EMA reflection papers on the use of extrapolation (EMA, 2008 and 2018). However these 
documents (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/692702/2008 reflection paper on the extrapolation of results from clinical 
studies conducted outside the eu to the eu-population)  and (EMA/189724/2018 reflection paper of the 
use  of  extrapolation  in  the  development  of  medicines  for  paediatrics)  were  deemed  out  of  the  scope 
here. Such an extrapolation of indication based on PK proposed by the applicant has not been described 
in any applicable guideline. Therefore, the extrapolation of indication based solely on PK can definitively 
not be supported. 
As a conclusion, the medical need in adult relapse Phi + ALL patients is acknowledged, as well as the 
relapse risk associated with MRD. However, despite clarifications provided, efficacy data available remain 
minimal and not deemed sufficient to conclude on risk benefit balance in the targeted indication. The 
MAH has agreed not to further pursue this indication. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical  efficacy  in  “the  treatment  as  monotherapy  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-
positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL  who  have  failed  treatment  with  at  least  2  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(TKIs) and have no alternative treatment options” can be considered as established  
This  extension  is  based  on  the  results  of  a  complete  phase  2,  non-comparative  single-arm  study 
20120216.  A  historical  control  study  20160462  and  a  propensity  score  analysis  were  conducted  to 
estimate the effects of blinatumomab compared with standard of care ALL therapy for treatment of Phi+ 
RR ALL adult patients.  
Despite methodological limitations of the submitted data, clinical relevance of results obtained in Phi + 
RR  ALL  patients,  after  at  least  2  TKI  treatments,  was  endorsed  in  these  patients  without  alternative 
treatment, with a durable CR rate of 35.6% (16/45) [21.9% to 51.2%], including 14 MRD response and 
OS  of  7.1  months  95%  (CI:  5.6  months  to  NE).  At  time  of  the  last  follow-up  date,  8  of  45  subjects 
(17.8%) were alive (including 5 from patients in CR).  
During the procedure the MAH has agreed not to further pursue at this stage the following indications 
for

relapsed/refractory  ALL  who  have  failed  treatment  with  at  least  2  TKIs  and  have  no

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Blinatumomab is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adults and children 
greater than 1 years old with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor 
ALL  and  for  the  treatment  of  adults  in  first  or  second  hematologic  complete  remission  (CR)  with 
Philadelphia chromosome-negative minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive ALL.  
Known safety profile 
The adverse reactions in these indications were identified in clinical studies of patients with B precursor 
ALL  (N  =  843).  The  most  serious  adverse  reactions  that  may  occur  during  blinatumomab  treatment 
include:  infections  (24.8%),  neurologic  events  (13.8%),  neutropenia/febrile  neutropenia  (10.1%), 
cytokine release syndrome (3.3%), and tumour lysis syndrome (0.7%). 
The most common adverse reactions were: pyrexia (69.2%), infusion-related reactions (43.4%), 
infections – pathogen unspecified (42.1%), headache (32.9%), anaemia (22.8%), thrombocytopenia 
(20.9%), febrile neutropenia (20.2%), oedema (20.0%), neutropenia (19.7%), rash (16.7%), 
increased liver hepatic enzymes (16.1%), bacterial infectious disorders (15.4%), tremor (15.2%), 
cough (15.1%), leukopenia (13.4%), back pain (13.3%), chills (13.0%), hypotension (12.8%), viral 
infectious disorders (12.7%), decreased immunoglobulins (12.5%), cytokine release syndrome 
(11.6%), tachycardia (11.3%), insomnia (10.7%), fungal infectious disorders (10.6%) and pain in 
extremity (10.2%).  
Extension of indication 
The purpose of this variation application is to widen the indication to include:  
•  The treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed/refractory ALL who 
have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment 
options.  
•  The treatment of paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed/refractory ALL 
who have failed treatment with at least 2 TKIs and have no alternative treatment options. 
•  The  treatment of adult  patients  in  first or second  hematologic  CR with Philadelphia  chromosome  -
positive MRD-positive ALL.  
Source of safety data 
Clinical studies contributing to safety in subjects with ALL are summarized in the Table 36. Safety data 
were collected and analysed for all 8 studies shown in this table. 
This  safety  analysis  provides  safety  data  from  Study  20120216,  the  phase  2, open-label,  single-arm,

2.5.2.2.  Adverse events 
•  Overview of safety profile 
Adverse  events  were  defined  as  events  that  started  between  the  start  of  the  first  infusion  of 
blinatumomab (initial treatment or retreatment) and 30 days after the end of the last infusion during 
the study. Subjects continued to be followed every 3 months for 18 months to measure response duration 
and OS, after the adverse events collection period was over. Changes in the safety data from the final 
analysis (through to 06 January 2017) are also reported, as applicable. 
Adverse events are presented in the following sections for the phase 2, randomized study in adults with 
Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL (Study 20120216) Safety Analysis Set (N 
= 45) and for the pooled adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population Safety Analysis 
Set  (N  =  528).  Any  differences  (ie,  ≥   10%  difference  in  subject  incidence)  between  the  2 
relapsed/refractory populations are noted. 
Per the protocol, disease progression of the primary tumour was not considered to be an adverse event. 
Signs and/or symptoms of disease progression (regardless of primary or secondary tumour) that were 
new  or  worsened  from  baseline  signs  and/or  symptoms  as  well  as  new  primary  malignancies  were 
considered adverse events.

In study 20120216, the incidence of adverse events per 100 weeks was lower for subjects who were 
treated  at  the  28-μg/day  dose  of  blinatumomab  (137.8  incidence  per  100  weeks;  44  subjects/320.8 
crude  exposure  weeks)  compared  with  subjects  who  were  treated  with  the  9-μg/day  dose  of 
blinatumomab (381.6 incidence per 100 weeks; 45 subjects/64.2 crude exposure weeks). 
•  Grade 3/ 4 TEAEs 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  the  rates  of  grade  ≥  3  and  grade  ≥  4  events  were  82.2%  and 
40.0%, respectively (Table 40). In the final analysis for this study, the incidence rate of grade ≥ 3 adverse 
events was 84.4%. The incidence of grade ≥ 4 adverse events remained unchanged (40.0%) in the final 
analysis. 
Regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status, the types and frequencies of grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 
adverse events were similar among the adult relapsed/refractory ALL subjects, with the exception of the 
incidence  of  treatment-related  grade  ≥  3  adverse  events,  which  had  a  higher  rate  in  subjects  with 
Philadelphia-negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  (54.9%  versus  44.4%  in  subjects  with  Philadelphia-
positive relapsed/refractory ALL).

•  Treatment-related Adverse Events 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, the rate of treatment-related adverse events was 91.1%. The rate 
of grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 treatment-related adverse events was 44.4% and 15.6%, respectively. There 
was 1 (2.2%) fatal event considered by the investigator to be related to blinatumomab. 
The highest rate of treatment-related adverse events by SOC in Study 20120216 was General Disorders 
and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (64.4%).  The  most  common  (subject  incidence  rate  ≥   10%) 
treatment-related  adverse  events  in  adult  subjects  with  Philadelphia-positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL 
were  pyrexia  (46.7%),  febrile  neutropenia  (24.4%),  anaemia  (13.3%),  and  ALT  increased,  AST  and 
headache increased (11.1% each). 
The  rate  of  treatment-related  grade  ≥   3  adverse  events  was  more  than  10%  lower  in  the  adult 
Philadelphia-positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL  population  compared  with  the  Philadelphia-negative 
population (44.4% versus 54.9%) (Table 40).  
Regardless  of  Philadelphia  chromosome  status,  the  types  of  treatment-related  adverse  events  (by 
preferred term) were similar among the subjects in relapsed/refractory ALL studies (.  
The highest rate of treatment-related adverse events by SOC in adult subjects with Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL was General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (51.1%). The most 
common (subject incidence rate ≥ 10%) treatment-related adverse events in the Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  population  were  pyrexia  (43.0%),  headache  (14.2%),  febrile  neutropenia 
(12.7%), CRS (12.5%), and neutropenia and tremor (11.6% for each).  
Apart from febrile neutropenia, which had a higher incidence rate in adult subjects with Philadelphia-
positive 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  compared  with  adult  subjects  with  Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL (24.4% versus 12.7%), there were no other treatment-related adverse events 
reported with a subject incidence of ≥ 10% between the relapsed/refractory populations.

2.5.2.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Deaths 
Adverse events were defined per the iSAP as adverse events that occurred between the start of the first 
infusion of blinatumomab (initial treatment or re-treatment) and 30 days after the end of the last infusion 
during the study. Updated data on fatal adverse events that occurred after study completion through 22 
February 2018 were also provided. 
In the primary analysis for Study 20120216, 11.1% (5/45) of subjects had fatal adverse events (Table 
42).One  fatal  adverse  event  (septic  shock)  was  reported  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
blinatumomab treatment:  
•  A 33-year-old female subject with relapsed/refractory ALL, who was receiving multiple concomitant 
medications, had a medical history including hypersensitivity reaction due to vancomycin (“Red man 
syndrome”),  thrombocytopenia,  leukocytosis  and  catheter-related  infection.  Blinatumomab  was 
discontinued after approximately 3 months of treatment per protocol requirements. Ten days later, 
the subject was diagnosed with shingles and acyclovir was initiated. Two days later, the subject was 
admitted to the hospital unconscious, with hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and fever. She was 
diagnosed  with  septic  shock,  pulmonary  hemorrhage,  pneumonia,  and  respiratory  failure.  She 
required intubation, intravenous fluids, and support; however, her condition worsened and she died 
1 day after admission to hospital. The investigator reported that there was a reasonable possibility 
that the fatal event of septic shock was related to blinatumomab, but not to study conduct. 
After Study 20120216 primary analysis cut-off date, there was 1 additional subject that died prior to 
study  completion  on  06  January  2017.  The  death  was  attributed  to  the  adverse  events  of  neoplasm 
malignant  and  pneumonia.  The  death  occurred  approximately  58  weeks  after  discontinuing 
blinatumomab and was not considered to be related to study treatment by the investigator.

Across the blinatumomab ALL studies, a total of 491 deaths were reported: 154 of 843 (18.3%) deaths 
occurred on-treatment or within 30 days from last infusion; 337 of 843 (40.0%) deaths occurred > 30 
days after the last infusion. Of the causes of death not reported as disease progression, aetiologies such 
as infections (eg, sepsis) were observed and would be expected in this population. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
rate of all fatal events and treatment-related fatal events were similar (11.1% versus 17.2% and 2.2% 
versus 2.5%, respectively). 
The  SOC  with  the  highest  incidence  of  fatal  adverse  events  in  the  adult  Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL population was Infections and Infestations (55/528; 10.4%) The most frequently 
reported  fatal  adverse  events  (reported  in  >  2  subjects)  in  the  adult  Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL population were sepsis (n = 14; 2.7%), septic shock (n = 8; 1.5%), pneumonia 
(n  =  6;  1.1%),  multi-organ  failure  (n  =  4;  0.8%),  and  acute  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (n  =  3;  0.6%). 
Thirteen of the 91 deaths that occurred in the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population 
were  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  blinatumomab  treatment.  Of  these  13  deaths,  10 
deaths were the result of infections, 2 deaths were the result of respiratory failure (1 of these subjects 
developed bacteraemia approximately 1 week before the onset of respiratory failure), and 1 death was 
reported due to encephalopathy. 
•  Other SAEs 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, serious adverse events were reported for 28 subjects (62.2%). 
The highest rate of serious adverse events by SOC was in Infections and Infestations (20.0%; 9/45). 
There  were  12  subjects  (26.7%)  with  serious  adverse  events  which  were  considered  to  be  related  to 
blinatumomab by the investigator. 
After  Study  20120216  completion  through  22  February  2018,  2  subjects  experienced  other  serious 
adverse events (1 subject experienced otitis media and acute kidney injury, and 1 subject experienced 
TLS). None of the events were considered related to blinatumomab treatment by the investigator and 
both subjects recovered from the events.

When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
rate of serious adverse events were similar (62.2% versus 63.4%). 
The highest rate of serious adverse events by SOC in the Philadelphia-negative population was also in 
Infections and Infestations (29.5% [156/528]) . The most frequently reported serious adverse events 
(subject incidence ≥ 2%) in this population were febrile neutropenia (8.5%), pyrexia (6.4%), sepsis and 
pneumonia (4.5% for each), device-related infection (2.8%), overdose (2.7%), encephalopathy (2.5%), 
CRS and neutropenia (2.3% for each), and septic shock (2.1%). There were no serious adverse events 
(by  preferred  term)  reported  with  a  ≥  10%  difference  between  the  adult  Philadelphia-positive  and  –
negative relapsed/refractory populations.

•  Treatment-emergent  Adverse  Events  Leading 
to  Treatment  Interruption  and 
Discontinuation 
For Study 20120216 (final analysis), adverse events leading to treatment interruption were reported in 
17 subjects (37.8%), including 13 patients (28.9%) with SAEs.  
The most frequently reported events leading to treatment interruption by SOC were in General Disorders 
and  Administration  Site  Conditions  SOC  and  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  (11.1%,  5/45  each). 
Adverse events leading to treatment interruption in ≥ 2 subjects were pyrexia (6.7%), and chills, device 
related infection, sepsis, ALT increased, and AST increased (4.4% for each). All other events leading to 
treatment interruption were reported in 1 subject each. 
Twelve (12) patients (26.7%) presented with related TEAEs leading to treatment interruption (Table 45).

Table 45: Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Interruption of Investigational Product 
by System Organ Class and Preferred Terma (Full Analysis Set) 
Refering to Table 40, when the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations 
were compared, the rates of treatment interruptions due to all adverse events, grade ≥ 3 adverse events, 
serious  adverse  events  and  fatal  adverse  events  were  similar.  In  addition,  the  rates  of  treatment 
interruption  due  to  treatment-related  events  (all  adverse  events,  grade  ≥  3  adverse  events,  serious 
adverse  events  and  fatal  adverse  events)  were  also  similar  regardless  of  Philadelphia  chromosome 
status. 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  leading  to  treatment  interruption  in  Phi  neg  patients 
(subject incidence ≥ 2%) were pyrexia (2.7%), CRS (3.0%), and confusional state (2.1%).

In Study 20120216 primary analysis, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported 
in 3 subjects (6.7%) (Table 40) and included 1 event each of grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 acute graft 
versus host disease, and grade 3 lung infection.  
The  serious  adverse  events  of  acute  graft  versus  host  disease  and  lung  infection  occurred  within  the 
induction phase of blinatumomab treatment. The event of neutropenia occurred during the consolidation 
phase  of  blinatumomab  treatment.  Events  of  neutropenia  and  acute  graft  versus  host  disease  were 
considered related to treatment per the investigator’s assessment. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
rates of treatment discontinuation due to all adverse events, grade ≥ 3 adverse events, serious adverse 
events and fatal adverse events were similar (Table 40). The rates of treatment discontinuation due to 
treatment-related events (all adverse events, grade ≥ 3 adverse events, serious adverse events and fatal 
adverse events) were also similar regardless of chromosome status. 
The highest rate of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation by SOC for adult subjects with 
Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL was in Infections and Infestations (4.2%) . There was no 
specific  preferred  term  reported  for  ≥   2%  of  subjects  in  this  population  that  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation.  The  most  frequently  reported  event  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  was 
encephalopathy (1.3%).

•  Neurologic Adverse Events 
The  analysis  of  adverse  events  suggestive  of  neurologic  and  psychiatric  events  was  based  on  a 
comprehensive  search  of  sponsor-defined  (AMQ)  high-level  group  terms  from  Nervous  Systems 
Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders SOCs (neurologic events from the AMQ search strategy).  
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 28 subjects (62.2%) were identified with experiencing at least 1 
neurologic event (Table 46). The most frequently reported (≥ 10% subject incidence rate) neurologic 
events  (by  preferred  terms)  were  headache  (31.1%;  14/45  subjects),  paresthesia  (13.3%;  6/45 
subjects),  and  confusional  state  (11.1%;  5/45  subjects).  The  median  time  to  the  first  onset  of  the 
identified neurologic events  was  8.5  days  and  all  events  resolved.  The  median  duration of  neurologic 
events was 4.5 days. 
Serious neurologic events were identified for 6 subjects in Study 20120216 primary analysis (13.3%: 
one of these subjects experienced tremor and encephalopathy, 2 additional subjects experienced tremor, 
1 subject experienced depressed level of consciousness, 1 subject experienced hemiplegia, and 1 subject 
experienced aphasia. Events of serious encephalopathy, serious tremor, serious aphasia, and confusional 
state  led  to  treatment  interruption  for  1  subject  each.  No  neurologic  events  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
•  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
The analysis of adverse events suggestive of CRS events was based on a Sponsor predefined narrow 
search strategy of Cytokine Release Syndrome (AMQ). 
For Study 20120216 primary analysis, a total of 4 subjects (8.9%) were identified with experiencing at 
least 1 CRS event (Table 46), with PTs CRS (6.7%; 3/45) and cytokine storm (2.2%; 1/45). None of 
the events identified were grade ≥ 3, led to treatment discontinuation or interruption, or were fatal. One 
of the events of CRS was considered serious for 1 subject. The median (range) time to the first onset of 
identified CRS events was 6.0 (1 to 52) days and all events had resolved. The duration of resolved CRS 
events (2 events) was 5.0 days. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 CRS event was similar (Table 46). 
The types of CRS events reported were consistent among adult subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL, 
regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status.  
The  median  time  to  first  onset  of  CRS  events  for  adult  subjects  with  Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL was earlier than for adult subjects with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory 
ALL (2.0 days versus 6.0 days, respectively).  
In summary, the incidence of subjects identified with a CRS event, and the types of CRS events reported 
were comparable between the Philadelphia-positive and –negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations. 
• 
Infections 
In Study 20120216 (primary analysis), a total of 22 subjects (48.9%) experienced at least 1 infection 
event (Table 46). The most frequently identified infection events (preferred terms) were device related 
infection (11.1%; 5/45), sepsis (8.9%; 4/45), and urinary tract infection (8.9%; 4/45). The median time 
to the first onset of infection event was 14.5 days and 2 infection events were unresolved . 
Serious infection events were reported for 9 subjects (20.0%) and included the following: device-related 
infection and sepsis (6.7%; 3/45 for each), and catheter site infection, lung infection, neutropenic sepsis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021

pneumonia, septic shock, and urinary tract infection (2.2%; 1/45 for each). An event of lung infection 
in 1 subject led to treatment discontinuation. Device-related infection and sepsis led to interruption of 
treatment for 2 subjects each, sepsis led to interruption, and neutropenic sepsis led to interruption of 
treatment in 1 subject. Fatal events of sepsis and septic shock occurred in 1 subject each. The event of 
septic shock was considered related to treatment with blinatumomab (per the investigator’s assessment. 
When the  Philadelphia-positive  and  -negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  populations  were  compared the 
incidence of subjects who experienced at least 1 infection event was ≥ 10% higher in the Philadelphia-
negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  population  (64.0%  versus  48.9%  in  the  Philadelphia-positive 
population).  The  median  time  to  first  onset  of  infection  events  for  adult  subjects  with  Philadelphia-
negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  was  17.0  days  versus  14.5  days  for  the  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL population. 
The rate of grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population was 
more than 10% higher compared with the Philadelphia-positive population (34.7% versus 24.4%). The 
rates  and  types  of  serious  infection  events  were  comparable  between  the  2  relapsed/refractory  ALL 
populations.  The  incidence  of  fatal  infection  events  was  also  comparable  regardless  of  chromosome 
status. 
•  Elevated Liver Enzymes 
Identification  of  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  in  Study  20120216  was  based  on  the  narrow  search 
strategy for the MedDRA SMQ Liver-related Investigations, Signs and Symptoms. 
For Study 20120216 primary analysis, a total of 8 subjects (17.8%) were identified with experiencing at 
least 1 elevated liver enzyme event. The most frequently reported elevated liver enzyme events (≥ 10% 
subject incidence rate) were AST increased (13.3%; 6/45) and ALT increased (11.1%; 5/45). The median 
time to the first onset of elevated liver enzyme events was 2.0 days and all events resolved. 
Serious elevated liver enzyme events were reported for 1 subject (2.2%) and included the events of ALT 
increased and AST increased. No fatal elevated liver enzyme events were reported.  
No  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  Study  20120216.  Events  of  ALT 
increased and AST increased led to interruption of treatment in 2 subjects; blood fibrinogen decreased 
and hepatic failure led to interruption of treatment in 1 subject each. 
The subject with AST increased leading to hepatic failure had been hospitalized approximately 5 months 
after receiving the first treatment, to start cycle 4 of blinatumomab; however, due to hepatic disorder, 
the  cycle  was  not  started.  Hospitalization  continued,  and  the  subject  was  reported  as  having  hepatic 
disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). During hospitalization, the subject’s AST  was 88 U/L, AST 80 
U/L, total bilirubin normal, and gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) 70 U/L. The subject’s event preferred 
term was later updated to hepatic failure, and history updated as having received an allogeneic HSCT 
from  an  unrelated  donor  (no  biopsy  performed).  Approximately  5.5  months  after  the  first  dose  of 
blinatumomab, the hepatic failure was reported to have resolved and the subject died later the same 
day, with cause of death described as a suspected brain infection. The investigator reported that there 
was not a reasonable possibility that the event hepatic disorder was related to blinatumomab treatment. 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, no subjects met the full parameters of Hy’s law laboratory criteria 
on the same day during the study.

When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 elevated liver enzyme event were similar. 
Regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status, the median time to first onset of elevated liver enzyme 
events were similar for the adult relapsed/refractory ALL subjects and the types elevated liver enzyme 
adverse events were comparable across the studies examined. 
The incidence rates of subjects identified with grade ≥ 3, and serious elevated liver enzyme events were 
similar in the adult relapsed/refractory ALL population, regardless of Philadelphia-chromosome status. 
No fatal elevated liver enzyme events were reported. 
In the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL studies, 5.6% (15/267) of subjects in Study 
00103311,  12.0%  (27/225)  of  subjects  in  Study  MT103-211,  and  13.9%  (5/36)  of  subjects  in  Study 
MT103-206  met  the  Hy’s  law  laboratory  criteria  on  any  day.  These  events  consistent  with  Hy’s  law 
laboratory criteria generally occurred within the first 2 days of the start of blinatumomab treatment and 
were transient in nature, recovering to baseline levels within a few days. No subjects met the full criteria 
for Hy’s law, since plausible alternative aetiologies or confounding factors were present that are known 
to be associated with the elevations in liver enzymes or hepatic dysfunction (eg, elevated liver enzymes 
at  baseline;  concomitant  therapy  with  medications  known  to  be  hepatotoxic;  a  setting  of  CRS  and 
macrophage activation syndrome). 
• 
Infusion Reactions 
Potential infusion-related adverse events were identified by applying a AMQ narrow search strategy of 
preferred  terms  likely  associated  with  infusion  reactions.  A  preferred  term  was  considered  to  be  an 
infusion reaction if it occurred within 48 hours of the infusion. 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  22  subjects  (48.9%)  were  identified  as  experiencing  at  least  1 
infusion  reaction  event  (Table  46).  The  most  frequently  reported  (incidence  rate  ≥  10%)  infusion 
reaction  adverse  event  was  pyrexia  (40.0%;  18/45).  The  median  time  to  the  first  onset  of  infusion 
reaction events was 2.0 days and all events were resolved. 
No fatal infusion reaction events were reported. A serious infusion reaction event of CRS was reported 
for 1 subject. No subjects experienced an infusion reaction event that led to treatment. Events of pyrexia 
led to interruption of treatment in 3 subjects. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence  of  subjects  identified  with  experiencing  at  least  1  infusion  reaction  event  were  similar.  The 
types of infusion reaction events reported were consistent among adult subjects with relapsed/refractory 
ALL, regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status. The median time to onset of infusion reactions was 
the same in both populations (Table 47). 
The  incidence  rates  of  grade  ≥  3  and  serious  infusion  reaction  events  were  also  similar  regardless  of 
Philadelphia-chromosome status. No fatal infusion reaction events were reported. 
•  Medication Errors 
The analysis of adverse events suggestive of medication errors was based on a predefined broad search 
strategy (AMQ). In Study 20120216, overdose was defined as a dose of > 10% higher than the intended 
blinatumomab dose. Guidance to the investigator was to report these errors as a serious adverse event. 
An  adverse  event  suggestive  of  a  medication  error  event  (grade  1  overdose)  occurred  in  1  subject 
(2.2%). Time to onset of this event was 9.0 days. This event of overdose was identified as serious that 
led to study drug interruption, but not treatment discontinuation. The event of overdose was reported 
to be resolved. No obvious signs or symptoms were present for this subject.

In  Study  20120216  final  analysis  an  additional  subject  was  reported  to  have  experienced  a  serious 
medication error event (device infusion issue) that led to study drug interruption. 
•  Decreased Immunoglobulins 
Adverse  events  suggestive  of  decreased  immunoglobulin  events  were  identified  based  on  an  Amgen 
MedDRA Query (AMQ), narrow search strategy. 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  4  subjects  (8.9%)  were  identified  with  experiencing  at  least  1 
immunoglobulin event; preferred terms for the reported events were hypogammaglobulinaemia (6.7%) 
and immunoglobulins decreased (2.2%). The median time to the first onset of decreased immunoglobulin 
events  was  105.5  days  and  all  events  resolved.  None  of  the  events  were  grade  ≥  3,  serious,  led  to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption, or were fatal. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 decreased immunoglobulin event was similar. 
The  types  of  immunoglobulin  events  reported  were  consistent  among  adult  subjects  with 
relapsed/refractory ALL, regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status. The median time to first onset 
of decreased immunoglobulin events for the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL studies 
was 42.0 days. 
The rates of grade ≥ 3 decreased immunoglobulin events were comparable for the adult Philadelphia-
positive  and  –negative  relapsed/refractory  ALL  studies.  No  serious  or  fatal  decreased  immunoglobulin 
events were reported in the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population. 
•  Embolic and Thrombotic Events Including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
Adverse events suggestive of venous thrombosis and thromboembolic events were based on the narrow 
search strategy for the MedDRA SMQ Embolic and Thrombotic Events. 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  3  subjects  (6.7%)  were  identified  with  experiencing  at  least  1 
embolic  and  thrombotic  event.  Reported  events  (1  of  each)  included  DIC,  thrombosis  in  device, 
hemiplegia,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease.  The  median  time  to  first 
onset of events suggestive of embolic and thrombotic events for Study 20120216 was 175.0 days. 
The incidence rate of subjects identified with grade ≥ 3 embolic and thrombotic events was 2 subjects 
(4.4%), of which 1 event was reported as serious (2.2%). No fatal embolic or thrombotic events were 
identified in Study 20120216 primary analysis. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 embolic and thrombotic event was similar. 
The most commonly reported events in the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory population included 
DIC  (1.1%)  and  deep  vein  thrombosis  1.1%.  The  median  time  to  first  onset  of  the  embolic  and 
thrombotic event in this population was 22.0 days. 
The incidence rates of grade ≥ 3 and serious embolic and thrombotic events were comparable regardless 
of  Philadelphia-chromosome  status.  Fatal  embolic  or  thrombotic  events  were  reported  for  2  subjects 
(0.4%) in the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL studies. 
•  Leukoencephalopathy 
Data from Amgen Safety Database were reviewed to identify events reported as leukoencephalopathy, 
as  well  an  additional  review  of  any  serious  neurologic  events  to  identify  any  cases  that  contained 
descriptive content on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography findings that might 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 93/134 
 
 
  
  
 
identify potential cases of leukoencephalopathy, which were not otherwise reported. In addition, a review 
of each case was made to determine if the diagnostic criteria for PML were present (clinical presentation, 
imaging findings, and cerebrospinal fluid PCR positive for John Cunningham Virus (JC Virus) (Keene et 
al, 2011). 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  1  subject  (2.2%)  was  identified  as  experiencing  a  single 
leukoencephalopathy event. Time to onset of this event was 23.0 days. The event was not grade ≥ 3 or 
serious. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
safety profile regarding this AESI was similar. 
•  Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia 
Adverse events suggestive of neutropenia events were based on the AMQ, narrow search strategy. 
In  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  21  subjects  (46.7%)  were  identified  experiencing  at  least  1 
neutropenia  event  (Table  46).  Neutropenia  events  (preferred  terms)  included  febrile  neutropenia 
(40.0%; 18/45), neutropenia (6.7%; 3/45), and neutropenic sepsis (2.2%; 1/45). The median time to 
first onset of neutropenia events was 3.0 days (Table 47) and all events were resolved. 
Serious neutropenia events were identified for 4 subjects (8.9%); the event of febrile neutropenia was 
reported for all 4 subjects; and neutropenic sepsis in 1 of the subjects. An event of neutropenia in 1 
subject  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Events  of  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  sepsis  led  to 
interruption  of  treatment  in  1  subject  each.  No  fatal  neutropenia  events  were  reported  in  Study 
20120216. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects with adverse events suggestive of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia was similar 
(Table 46). The median time to first onset for the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL 
subjects (10.0 days) was longer compared with the adult Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL 
subjects (3.0 days) (Table 47) The rate of febrile neutropenia (by preferred term) was ≥ 10% higher in 
adult Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL subjects compared with adult Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL subjects (40.0% versus 24.4%, respectively), whereas the rate of neutropenia 
was  ≥  10%  lower  in  adult  Philadelphia-positive  relapsed/refractory  ALL  subjects  compared  with  adult 
Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL subjects (6.7% versus 18.0%, respectively). Otherwise, 
the incidence of subjects identified with a neutropenia or febrile neutropenia event (all adverse events, 
grade ≥ 3, serious events, and fatal events) were comparable between the 2 populations.  
2.5.2.5.  Minimum Critical Toxicities 
For  pooled  datasets,  analyses  of  minimum  critical  toxicities  were  conducted  for  the  ALL  pooled 
population. 
•  Bone Marrow Toxicity (Cytopenias) 
Adverse events suggestive of bone marrow cytopenia events are based on the narrow search strategy 
for the MedDRA SMQ Hematopoietic Cytopenias.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 94/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 29 subjects (64.4%) were identified with experiencing at least 1 
cytopenia  event.  The  most  frequently  identified  cytopenia  events  (preferred  terms)  were  febrile 
neutropenia (40.0%; 18/45) and thrombocytopenia (22.2%; 10/45). 
A total of 24 subjects (53.3%) and 11 subjects (24.4%) were identified with grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 
cytopenia  events,  respectively.  Serious  cytopenia  events  were  reported  for  4  subjects  (8.9%)  and 
included febrile neutropenia in all 4 subjects, and neutropenic sepsis and pancytopenia in 1 subject each. 
An event of neutropenia in 1 subject led to treatment discontinuation. Events of febrile neutropenia and 
neutropenic  sepsis  led to interruption  of  treatment in  1  subject  each.  No  fatal  cytopenia  events  were 
reported in Study 20120216. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 cytopenia event were similar (64.4% versus 
56.8%). The types of cytopenia events reported were similar in both relapsed/refractory populations; 
however,  the  event  of  febrile  neutropenia  had  a  higher  incidence  rate  in  subjects  with  Philadelphia-
positive 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  compared  with  adult  subjects  with  Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  (40.0%  versus  24.4%,  respectively).  The  rates  of  all  other  cytopenia  events 
were similar between the populations, regardless of chromosome status. 
The rates of grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and serious cytopenia events were also comparable between the 2 
relapsed/refractory  populations.  Fatal  bone  marrow  cytopenia  events  were  reported  for  4  subjects 
(0.8%) in the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population. 
•  Hepatotoxicity 
For this variation application, potential hepatotoxicity was assessed similarly to the search strategy use 
in the initial MAA. 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 11 subjects (24.4%) with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory 
ALL were identified with experiencing at least 1 drug-related hepatotoxicity event. The most frequently 
reported  drug-related  hepatic  disorders  events  (≥  2%  subject  incidence  rate)  were  AST  increased 
(13.3%),  ALT  increased  (11.1%),  blood  bilirubin  increased  (6.7%),  ascites  (2.2%),  hepatic  failure 
(2.2%), hepatocellular injury (2.2%), GGT increased (2.2%), and blood fibrinogen increased (2.2%). 
The rates of identified grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 drug-related hepatotoxicity events were 15.6% and 6.7%, 
respectively. Serious drug-related hepatotoxicity events were identified in 2 subjects (4.4%).  
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 drug-related hepatotoxicity event was similar 
(24.4% versus 29.0%). The types, and most frequently reported drug-related hepatic disorders events, 
were comparable in both adult relapsed/refractory ALL populations. 
The rates of identified grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and serious drug-related hepatotoxicity events were also 
similar between the 2 populations, regardless of chromosome status. No fatal drug-related hepatotoxicity 
events were reported in either populations. 
•  Nephrotoxicity 
Potential  nephrotoxicity  was  assessed  for  the  adult  relapsed/refractory  ALL  population,  applying  the 
narrow search of MedDRA SMQ for Acute Renal Failure. 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 1 subject (2.2%) was identified with experiencing a single acute 
renal failure event, with the preferred term of renal. The event was not grade ≥ 3 or serious.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 95/134 
 
 
  
  
 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 acute renal failure event was similar (2.2% 
versus  5.3%).  The  most  frequently  reported  acute  renal  failure  event  in  subjects  with  Philadelphia-
negative relapsed/refractory ALL (≥ 2% subject incidence rate) was acute kidney injury (2.8%).  
The  rates  of  identified  grade  ≥  3  and  grade  ≥  4  acute  renal  failure  events  were  1.5%  and  0.2%, 
respectively.  Serious  acute  renal  failure  events  were  identified  in  5  subjects  (0.9%).  One  fatal  acute 
renal failure event (0.2%) was reported. 
•  Arrhythmia, Convulsions, and Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation 
To  identify  events  suggestive  of  cardiac  arrhythmias,  convulsions,  and  torsade  de  pointes/QT 
prolongation in the ALL pooled population, MedDRA SMQ narrow search strategies were utilized. 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 3 subjects (6.7%) with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory 
ALL  were  identified  with  experiencing  at  least  1 cardiac  arrhythmia  event;  all  3  subjects  experienced 
cardiac arrhythmia event of atrial fibrillation. The rate of identified grade ≥ 3 cardiac arrhythmia events 
was 2.2%. There were no serious or fatal cardiac arrhythmia events. 
No convulsion or Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation events were identified in subjects with Philadelphia-
positive relapsed/refractory ALL. 
When the Philadelphia-positive and -negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations were compared, the 
incidence of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 cardiac arrhythmia event was similar (6.7% 
versus  9.1%)  .  The  most  frequently  reported  cardiac  arrhythmia  event  in  subjects  with  Philadelphia-
negative relapsed/refractory ALL (≥ 2% subject incidence rate) was sinus tachycardia (5.3%). The rates 
of identified grade ≥ 3, grade ≥ 4, and serious cardiac arrhythmia events were 1.5%, 0.2%, and 0.9%, 
respectively. No fatal cardiac arrhythmia events were reported. 
A  total  of  17  subjects  (3.2%)  were  identified  experiencing  at  least  1  convulsion  event  in  the  adult 
Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population. The most frequently reported convulsion event 
(≥  2%  subject  incidence  rate)  was  seizure  (2.7%).  The  rates  of  identified  grade  ≥  3,  grade  ≥  4,  and 
serious convulsion events were 1.5%, 0.2%, and 1.7%, respectively. No fatal convulsion events were 
reported. 
In  this  population,  6  subjects  (1.1%)  were  identified  experiencing  at  least  1  Torsade  de  pointes/QT 
prolongation  event,  of  which  1  subject  (0.2%)  was  identified  as  experiencing  Torsade  de  pointes/QT 
prolongation event of Grade ≥ 3. No fatal Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation events were reported. 
• 
Immunogenicity 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, 29 subjects (64.4%) had a sample collected for antibody testing 
after  blinatumomab  was  administered.  None  of  these  subjects  tested  positive  for  anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies.  
In the Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL studies, a total of 7 out of 422 subjects (3 subjects 
[1.7%]  in  Study  MT103-211,  and  4  subjects  [1.6%]  in  Study  00103311)  tested  positive  for  anti-
blinatumomab antibodies (Section 11.2 of 00103311 Primary Analysis CSR, EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009). 
To  date,  development  of  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADAs)  has  been  detected  in  9  subjects  across  all 
blinatumomab  studies.  Of  these  9  subjects,  7  subjects  were  identified  with  ADAs  that  had  in-vitro 
neutralizing activity. Among the 9 cases, 7 subjects achieved clinical response (CR/complete remission 
with partial hematological recovery [CRh*]) as defined in the respective protocols.

Important Hematology Laboratory Evaluations 
Table 49: Summary of Worst Hematology Laboratory Toxicity Change From Baseline During the Core 
Study – Change of 3 Grades or More for Blinatumomab ALL Studies (Safety Analysis Set) 
•  Coagulation Laboratory Evaluations 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, the median changes in international normalized ratio (INR) from 
baseline to the end of cycle 1 (cycle 1, day 29) and cycle 2 (cycle 2, day 29) were 0.000 and -0.020, 
respectively.  At  the  safety  follow-up  visit,  the  median  change  in  INR  from  baseline  was  -0.040.  The 
median changes in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) from baseline to the end of cycle 1 (cycle 1, day 
29) and cycle 2 (cycle 2, day 29) were 3.050 and 3.000, respectively. At the safety follow-up visit, the 
median change in PTT from baseline was 1.150. 
Data regarding changes in fibrinogen values from baseline are not available for Study 20160216. 
Pooled data analyses for the adult Philadelphia-negative population are not available for INR and PTT 
values, as coagulation evaluations were not conducted in Study 00103311. 
During the core phase of Study MT103-211 (N = 189), maximum INR value, maximum PTT values, and 
minimum  fibrinogen  concentrations  were  relatively  stable  over  the  treatment  duration.  The  following 
shifts from grade < 3 to grade ≥ 3 in fibrinogen values occurred during the core study: from grade 0 to 
grade 3 (0.5%; 1/196); from grade 1 to grade 4 (11.1%; 1/9); from grade 2 to grade 3 (20.0%; 1/5). 
Fibrinogen values were missing for 12 subjects from grade 0 to grade 3 (0.5% [1/196]); from grade 1 
to grade 4 (11.1% [1/9]); from grade 2 to grade 3 (20.0% [1/5]). . In Study MT103-206, slight to no 
fluctuations were noted in coagulation laboratory values from baseline to the end of core study and to 
the end of follow-up period in subjects overall for prothrombin time/INR, PTT, and for fibrinogen from 
baseline to end of treatment cycle . Within this population, worsening shifts (decreases) of 3 grades from 
baseline fibrinogen values occurred in 3 subjects (0.6%). There were no 4 grade shifts from baseline 
fibrinogen in this population.

• 
Immunoglobulins 
Only immunoglobulin G (IgG) evaluations were conducted as part of Study 20120216 primary analysis. 
Immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) evaluations were only 
conducted in 1 Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL study (Study MT103-206). 
In Study 20120216 primary analysis, the median (range) IgG value at baseline was 5.650 g/L (2.970 to 
10.360 g/L). 
The median changes in IgG from baseline to the end of cycle 1 (cycle 1, day 29) and cycle 2 (cycle 2, 
day 29) were -0.850 g/L and -1.310 g/L, respectively. At the safety follow-up visit, the median change 
in IgG from baseline was -1.380 g/L. 
Pooled  data  analyses  regarding  IgG  value  changes  from  baseline  in  the  adult  Philadelphia-negative 
population are not available. In Study MT103-206, the median (range) IgG baseline value was 5.680 g/L 
(1.94  to  11.40  g/L)  in  subjects  treated  with  blinatumomab.  The  median  change  in  IgG  value  from 
baseline  to  the  end  of  cycle  1  (cycle  1,  day  29),  was  -1.190  g/L  (-5.36  to  3.61  g/L).  The  maximum 
change from baseline was at the end of cycle 6 (cycle 6, day 29) with a median (range) IgG value of -
5.735 g/L (-6.51 to -4.96 g/L). 
In Study 00103311, the median (range) IgG baseline value was 6.02 g/L (1.8 to 16.6 g/L) in subjects 
treated with blinatumomab. The median changes in IgG from baseline to the end of cycle 1 (cycle 1, day 
29) and cycle 2 (cycle 2, day 29) were -1.35 g/L and -2.25 g/L, respectively. At the safety follow-up 
visit, the median change in IgG from baseline was -1.85 g/L. In Study MT103 211, the median minimum 
IgG concentration at baseline was 6.055 (range: 1.00 to 19.20 g/L). During the core study, IgG values 
decreased with increasing number of treatment cycles. The nadir of IgG concentration occurred at day 
29 of cycle 4, with the lowest median IgG concentration of 2.680 g/L. At the end of the core study, the 
median minimum IgG concentration was 4.510 g/L. 
•  Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Abnormalities observed during Study 20120216 primary analysis included a high pulse rate in 15.6% of 
subjects, high or low blood pressure measurements (high systolic blood pressure in 11.1% of subjects, 
and low systolic blood pressure in 15.6% of subjects; high diastolic blood pressure in 4.4% of subjects 
and low diastolic blood pressure in 6.7% of subjects), increase or decrease in weight (≥ 10% increase 
from baseline in 11.1% of subjects and ≤ 10% increase from baseline in 6.7% of subjects) and increased 
body temperature of > 39°C in 11.1% of subjects. 
The analysis of vital signs results in the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population 
is  consistent  with  that  previously  reported.  Compared  with  the  adult  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL subjects, this population had a higher incidence rate (≥ 10% difference) of body 
temperature > 39°C (20.1% versus 11.1%), and low diastolic blood pressure (23.5% versus 6.7%). 
With  these  exceptions,  the  vital  sign  results  were  comparable  between  the  2  relapsed/refractory 
populations.

2.5.2.7.  Safety in special populations 
The MAH provided TEAEs analysis by subgroup of age, sex, race, region, ECOG performance status, and 
renal function.  
•  Age 
In study 20120216, in order to allow comparison despite limited and imbalanced sample size, the MAH 
provided safety results comparing elderly (≥ 65 years; n = 12) and non-elderly (< 65 years; n = 33) 
subjects in Study 20120216.

The  highest  incidence  rate  of  adverse  events  by  SOC  was  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site 
Conditions, for both subjects < 65 years of age (28/33 subjects; 84.8%) and subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
(12/12 subjects; 100.0%). There was no discernable trend or pattern observed for events (by preferred 
term) that occurred by age. 
In Study 20120216, grade ≥ 3 events (by preferred term) of anemia and aplasia occurred more frequently 
(≥ 10% difference) in elderly subjects, whilst febrile neutropenia, pain and ALT increased occurred more 
frequently in subjects < 65 years of age; however, the 95% CIs overlapped substantially suggesting no 
statistically significant difference.

•  Sex 
Subgroup analysis was provided by sex, for study 20120216 and pooled adult RR ALL Phi neg patients, 
as summarized in tables below. 
For study 20120216, the highest incidence rate of adverse events by SOC was General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions, for both male and female subjects (21/24 subjects; 87.5% and 19/21 
subjects; 90.5%, respectively).  
For serious adverse events by SOC, the highest incidence rate in male subjects was in Infections and 
Infestations (6/24 subjects; 25.0%), driven by PTs device related infection and sepsis (2/24 subjects; 
8.3% for each). The highest incidence rate of serious adverse events by SOC in female subjects was 
observed in General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions and Nervous System Disorders (5/21 
subjects; 23.8% for each), driven by non-cardiac chest pain and tremor, respectively ((2/21 subjects; 
9.5% for each PT).

•  Race 
For  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  the  sample  sizes  among  the  race  categories  for  this  subgroup 
analysis were imbalanced; 39 subjects (86.7%) were white and 6 subjects (13.3%) were other races 
(not otherwise specified). Further analyses by race were not possible for this population, due to the small 
sample size. 
In the adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL population, the sample sizes among the race 
categories were also imbalanced; 432 subjects (81.8%) were white and 96 subjects (18.2%) were other 
races. Although imbalances were observed, there were no differences of ≥ 10% in the rate of adverse 
events between the races.

For  Study  20120216  primary  analysis,  the  sample  sizes  among  the  regions  for  this  analysis  were 
imbalanced; 11 subjects (24.4%) were from the US and 34 subjects (75.6%) were from Europe. Subjects 
from the US, compared with subjects from Europe, had ≥ 10% higher incidence rates of grade ≥ 3 adverse 
events,  serious  adverse  events,  events  leading  to  treatment  interruption,  and  fatal  adverse  events; 
however, the 95% CIs overlapped substantially suggesting no statistically significant difference. Rates 
of events leading to treatment discontinuation were comparable for subjects from the US and Europe. 
Grade  ≥   3  events  occurring  with  a  ≥   10%  difference  between  regions  for  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL subjects included febrile neutropenia, anemia, leukocytosis, pain, device-related 
infection,  sepsis,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  platelet  count  decreased,  WBC  count  decreased  and 
respiratory failure (occurred more frequently in the US), and thrombocytopenia and pyrexia (occurred 
more frequently in Europe). Two serious events occurred with a ≥ 10% difference between subjects in 
the  US  and  Europe  (device-related  infection  [18.2%;  95%  CI:  2.3,  51.8  versus  2.9%;  95%  CI:  0.1, 
15.3]  and  respiratory  failure  [18.2%;  95%  CI:  2.3,  51.8  versus  0%;  95%  CI:  0,  10.3The  95%  CIs 
overlapped substantially for the above comparisons suggesting no statistically significant difference.

The MAH concluded that, although there were differences observed by region in Study 20120216 and 
between  the  2  relapsed/refractory  ALL  populations,  the  95%  CIs  overlapped  substantially  for  the 
comparisons suggesting no statistically significant difference. In addition, the imbalance in sample size 
within the populations does not allow for an adequate comparison.

•  ECOG Performance Status 
In Study 20120216, 16 subjects (35.6%) had a baseline ECOG status of 0, 20 subjects (44.4%) had a 
baseline ECOG status of 1, and 9 subjects (20.0%) had a baseline ECOG status of 2.

The incidence of grade ≥ 3 events by preferred term occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects by ECOG status were 
presented  in  Table  above.  Some  differences  between  the  2  relapsed/refractory  populations  were 
observed; however, due to the small number of subjects within each ECOG performance status category 
for  Philadelphia-positive  subjects,  and  the  imbalance  in  number  of  subjects  within  each  ECOG 
performance status category for each population, an adequate comparison cannot be performed. 
•  Renal Function 
For  Study  20120216,  the  sample  sizes  among  renal  function  categories  for  this  analysis  were 
imbalanced; 31 subjects (68.9%) had normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min), 8 subjects (17.8%) 
had mild renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min to < 90 mL/min), and 6 subjects (13.3%) had moderate 
renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min to < 60 mL/min).

•  Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Cumulatively, from clinical studies, there was 1 case of pregnancy reported in the long-term follow-up 
phase  of  a  clinical  trial.  The  case  described  a  female  with  MRD-positive  ALL  who  became  pregnant  6 
months  after  the  last  dose  of  blinatumomab  in  Study  MT103-203.  Approximately  5  months  into  the 
pregnancy, an ultrasound revealed normal results with no fetal abnormalities detected. The outcome of 
the pregnancy was a live birth at the gestational age of 37 weeks. The investigator reported that the 
infant did not have any complications, medical problems, or congenital anomalies. 
Cumulatively,  from  non-study  sources,  there  were  2  cases  of  pregnancy  reported.  The  first  case 
described  a  male  patient  with  a  pregnant  partner  who  was  potentially  exposed  while  changing  the 
infusion bags. The birth outcome was unknown (lost to follow-up). The second case described an event 
of fetal death while a female patient was receiving blinatumomab. The case did not provide the patients 
age or obstetric history. The patient was diagnosed with B-ALL in July 2018. The patient was treated 
sequentially. However, the ALL was refractory to both. Subsequently, blinatumomab was started at 9 
μg/day  x  1  week,  and  the  dose  was  escalated  to  28  μg/day.  On  day  14  of  blinatumomab  treatment 
(approximately 26 weeks gestation), the patient had a “spontaneous birth of a life-less child.” No details 
were provided as to fetal monitoring prior to the birth, autopsy, or pathology of fetus.

2.5.3.  Clinical safety in peadiatric RR Phi + ALL patients 
The MAH cross-referenced to previous variation application in Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory ALL Variation 
Application (EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018).  
The MAH also summarized that three paediatric subjects with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory 
ALL  were  enrolled  in  Study  MT103-205.  All  3  subjects  were  heavily  pretreated  for  their  disease  with 
chemotherapy  and  HSCT  conditioning  regimens  and  received  an  allogeneic  HSCT  from  an  unrelated 
donor. Most adverse events experienced by these subjects were grades 1 or 2 in severity and the types 
of  adverse  events  were  consistent  with  those  reported  in  this  variation  application.  One  subject 
experienced grade 4 events of neutropenia and leukopenia, which resolved without dose interruption. A 
second  subject  experienced  grade  3  pyrexia  and  hyperglycemia,  which  resolved  without  dose 
interruption. The third subject had no grade ≥ 3 adverse events.

2.5.4.  Clinical safety in adult MRD Phi + ALL patients 
Safety  data  in  adult  MRD+  ALL  patients  were  included  in  tables  in  the  integrated  safety  summary, 
independently of Phi status. 
2.5.5.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  blinatumomab.  Blinatumomab  is  a 
therapeutic protein and is not expected to affect cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and catabolism of 
other  proteins.  Blinatumomab  may  induce  transient  cytokine  elevations  and  the  elevated  cytokines, 
especially  IL-6,  may  have  suppressive  effect  on  P450  enzymes.  Evaluation  of  effect  of  cytokines  on 
activities of P450 enzymes was conducted with a physiological-based PK model and results were provided 
in the original MAA submission and it was concluded that the blinatumomab mediated cytokine elevation, 
has a low potential to affect exposure levels of other drugs and the effect is inconsequential. 
2.5.6.  Post marketing experience 
From  the  International  Birth  Date  of  03  December  2014  to  02  December  2018  (data  lock  point  for 
PBRER/PSUR  #6),  an  estimated  7102  patients  had  been  exposed  to  blinatumomab  in  the  marketed 
setting (through commercialization and early access programs). 
As of 02 December 2018, Amgen received, cumulatively, a total of 3196 serious adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) in the postmarking setting, from spontaneous and solicited sources. In addition, 2093 nonserious 
ADRs were reported spontaneously. 
Overall, among the 3916 total serious ADRs reported from spontaneous and solicited sources, the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions were from the SOCs of Nervous System Disorders (17.3%) and 
General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (15.7%). Serious ADRs  with an event incidence 
1%  were:  cytokine  release  syndrome  (5.4%),  pyrexia  (5.1%),  neurotoxicity  (4.4%),  death  (4.0%), 
acute lymphocytic leukemia recurrent (3.2%), neutropenia (3.0%), seizure (2.1%), febrile neutropenia 
(1.9%),  sepsis  (1.6%),  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (1.6%),  blast  cell  count  increased  (1.6%), 
thrombocytopenia  (1.5%),  confusional  state  (1.2%),  disease  progression  (1.1%),  hospitalization 
(1.1%),  and  pneumonia  (1.0%).  These  events  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
blinatumomab or representative of the underlying malignancy. 
Overall, the safety information received in the postmarketing setting was consistent with the established 
safety  profile  and  cumulative  experience  of  blinatumomab.  The  overall  benefit-risk  profile  of 
blinatumomab remains favorable in the approved indication. 
As  noted  above,  ADRs  are  reported  from  spontaneous  and  solicited  sources;  therefore,  some  patient 
details, such as Philadelphia chromosome status, may not have been reported. Thus, it is not possible 
to  report  ADRs  only  for  those  patients  who  received  blinatumomab  for  Philadelphia-positive 
relapsed/refractory ALL. 
A cumulative summary of adverse reactions that have been reported for blinatumomab in the marketed 
setting is provided in PBRER/PSUR #4 (Procedure number: EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010460/201712).

Investigator-sponsored Studies 
Up  to  22  February  2018,  a  total  of  112  cases  comprising  of  265  serious  and  12  nonserious  adverse 
events from investigator-sponsored studies were available in the Amgen safety database. Adverse events 
with an event incidence ≥ 1% were: febrile neutropenia (6.9%); sepsis (5.0%); device related infection 
(3.2%), seizure (2.9%); lung infection (2.5%); confusional state and lymphocyte count decreased (2.2% 
each); blood creatinine increased, CRS, hypotension and pyrexia (1.8% each); and ALT increased, AST 
increased,  encephalopathy,  hypokalaemia,  hypoxia,  pain,  platelet  count  decreased  and  respiratory 
failure  (1.4%  each).  These  events  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  blinatumomab  or 
representative of the underlying malignancy. 
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This  safety  analysis  provides  safety  data  from  Study  20120216,  the  phase  2, open-label,  single-arm, 
multicenter study of blinatumomab in adult subjects with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL. 
This review also includes safety results from pooled studies of adult subjects with Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL) (Studies 00103311, MT103-211, and MT103-206 [N = 528]). 
In  study  20120216,  patients  completed  a  median  of  2  cycles,  with  a  mean  exposure  of  59,88  days. 
Exposure was similar among pooled RR Phi neg adult studies and peadiatric studies, despite a median 
of 1 cycle. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between study 20120216 and 
pooled ALL RR Phi neg ALL studies. However, it should be noted that patients in study 20120216 were 
older (median age of 55.0 years, vs 37.5), with most of patients in this study aged 55 and over (51.1%). 
In  study  20120216,  a  higher  proportion of  patients  had  PNN  <  500/µL  (42.2 %  vs  30.5%)  and prior 
HSCT (44.4% vs 34.2%). 
All 45 patients presented with at least 1 TEAE, including 28 subjects with serious TEAE (62.2%). Most 
frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  pyrexia  (57.8%),  febrile  neutropenia  (40.0%),  headache  (31.1%), 
anaemia (28.9%), thrombocytopenia (22.2%), bone pain (20.0%), and diarrhoea (20.0%). The safety 
profile raised in RR Phi + adults ALL patients in study 20120216 was similar to RR Phi neg adults ALL 
pooled patients. It should anyway be noted that the frequency of febrile neutropenia was higher in Phi 
+ subjects (40.0% vs 24.4%).  
The  most  frequently  reported  grade  3/  4  TEAEs  were  febrile  neutropenia  (26.7%),  thrombocytopenia 
(22.2%), anaemia (15.6%), and pyrexia, ALT increased, and AST increased (11.1% each). The safety 
profile remained similar in terms of grade 3/ 4 AEs between adult RR ALL Phi + and Phi neg patients. 
However, the frequency of grade 3 /4 thrombocytopenia was higher in Phi + patients (22.2 vs 12.3%) 
while a higher frequency of grade 3 /4 neutropenia was observed in Phi neg patients (6.7 vs 16.3%). 
The  frequency  of  treatment-related  AEs  was  91.1%,  higher  than  in  pooled  adult  RR  Phi  neg  patients 
(84.7%), with a similar trend in related AEs reported except for the higher frequency of related febrile 
neutropenia (24.4 vs 12.7%).. 
A total of 6 fatal AEs were reported, including 1 case of treatment-related fatal sepsis. No unexpected 
trend in fatal AEs was reported, nor new safety signal. Moreover, 62.2% of patients presented with SAEs, 
driven by  febrile  neutropenia  (8.9%),  sepsis,  device  related  infection  and  tremor  (6.7% each).  When 
compared to adult RR Phi neg ALL pooled patients, no unexpected trend in SAEs was reported, nor new 
safety signal. 
No  unexpected  trend  in  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruption  was  observed  in  study  20120216,  nor 
while comparing both Phi + and Phi neg RR ALL adult populations.

There was no discernable trend or pattern observed for events (by preferred term) by region. 
Regarding TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 3 patients (6.7%) presented with such TEAEs in 
study 20120216, including 2 related TEAEs neutropenia and acute graft versus host disease.  The global 
trend in reporting of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was similar between Phi + and Phi neg 
RR ALL adult populations.  
There were no events leading to treatment interruption, events leading to treatment discontinuation, or 
fatal  events  (by  preferred  term)  with ≥  10%  difference  between  subjects  from  the  US  and  Europe  in 
Study 20120216.  
The related case of acute GvHD reported in study 20120216 should be kept in mind. It concerns a 62 
year  old  female  patient,  who  presented  with  acute GvHD  (skin  stage  3,  bowel  stage 2,  liver  stage 0, 
grading 3) one month after treatment initiation. No other case of acute GvHD was reported in this study, 
and  this  AE  is  not  included  in  the  SmPC  nor  in  the  current  RMP.  It  should  be  noted  that  a 
noninterventional PASS is planned (20170610) in US and EU, which will cover this risk: “100-day survival 
and  risk  of  developing  acute  graft  versus  host  disease  (aGvHD)  in  relapsed/refractory  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  after  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant:  blinatumomab  vs  chemotherapy 
induction”. 
Prespecified AESIs were neurologic events, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, elevated liver 
enzymes,  infusion  reactions,  tumor  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  capillary  leak  syndrome  (CLS),  medication 
errors,  decreased 
immunoglobulins,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  (including  disseminated 
intravascular 
coagulation 
[DIC]), 
leukoencephalopathy 
including 
progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia,  lymphopenia,  immunogenicity,  and 
pancreatitis. 
Additionally, the following minimum critical toxicities were reviewed: bone marrow toxicity (cytopenias), 
hepatotoxicity,  nephrotoxicity,  and  torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  and 
convulsion.  
The impact of immunogenicity on safety was evaluated through medical review and assessment of the 
type and severity of adverse events, potential infusion reactions, and number of doses received while 
on study for blinatumomab-treated antibody-positive subjects. In those assessments, no evidence of an 
altered safety profile was observed for subjects who tested positive for anti-blinatumomab antibodies. 
No unexpected safety signal was raised from these AESIs and critical toxicities. 
However, some clarifications were requested by the MAH. Taking into account the delayed median time 
to onset (TTO) observed in Phi + patients for decreased immunoglobulin (105.5 days vs 42.0), embolic 
and thrombotic events (175 days vs 22 days), neurologic events (8.5 vs 6 days) and Cytokine release 
syndrome (6 vs 2 days), these delayed AEs occurrences were thus further discussed. The MAH considered 
that despite differences in median TTO, min-max intervals of TTOs for each of these AESIs in Phi+ RR 
ALL adult subjects are included in min-max intervals raised in Phi- RR ALL adult subjects. Thus, the MAH 
does not consider these differences in median TTO to be significant. High variability with very limited 
sample size in Phi + RR ALL subjects is acknowledged. One could also consider Q1-Q3 intervals, wider 
in Phi+ RR ALL adult patients and out of Q1-Q3 intervals in Phi – RR ALL adult patients (refer to detailed 
tables provided in response document). For example, in Embolic and Thrombotic Events, Q1-Q3 interval 
was 11.0, 53.0 in Phi neg RR ALL adult patients (n=41), vs 44.0, 206.0 in Phi+ RR ALL adult patients 
(n=3). For Decreased Immunoglobulins, Q1-Q3 interval was 29.0, 85.0 in Phi neg RR ALL adult patients 
(n=61),  vs  46.0,  144.0  in  Phi+  RR  ALL  adult  patients  (n=4).    However,  considering  the  very  limited 
sample size, no strong comparison could be raised and MAH conclusion is acknowledged. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 112/134 
 
 
  
  
 
Moreover, the MAH was asked to further discuss the increased risk of febrile neutropenia and its earlier 
onset (3 days vs 10 days) in Phi + patients, including potential causes for such higher incidence. The 
MAH discussed the differences observed in the onset of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, between 
Phi  +  and  Phi-  subjects.  The  MAH  considered  that  Amgen  SMQ  results  should be  taken  into  account, 
rather than isolated PT for this AE with several related PTs. This is endorsed. 
A lower incidence of CRS events was observed in Ph+ (8.9%) than in Ph- (14.2%) R/R ALL subjects and 
this  is  unexpected  due  to  the  higher  burden  of  baseline  disease  with  bone  marrow  blasts  ≥50%  by 
central laboratory assessments in 75.6% of Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL versus 65.6% 
of Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory ALL. Therefore the MAH was asked to discuss the reasons 
of  this  apparent  inconsistency  specifying  how  many  subjects  in  Study  20120216  underwent  to  pre-
medication and/or pre-phase treatment with dexamethasone. Data provided by the MAH suggest that 
the lower incidence of CSR in the Ph-positive ALL population could be in part due to the major proportion 
of patients receiving pre-phase treatment, however the very low sample size of this study population 
does not allow to draw firm conclusions. Moreover, all 4 subjects in the Ph-positive ALL population and 
the majority of patients (71,5%) in the Ph-negative ALL population whit CSR, had baseline bone marrow 
≥ 50% by central laboratory assessments, suggesting, as expected, that regardless of population, the 
rate of treatment-emergent CRS was highest among subjects with baseline blast counts ≥ 50%, and this 
is  agreed.  Finally,  while  the  onset  time  of  CRS  is  6.0  days  for  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory 
Philadelphia-positive ALL, 4 subjects with this disease experienced CRS, which represents 5.1% (4/79) 
of  the  total  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  ALL  and  3.6%  (4/111)  of  the  total  subjects  with  ALL. 
Therefore, the MAH considers that the small number of subjects with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia-
positive ALL that had CRS is not sufficient to update the time to on onset of CRS for the Summary of 
Product Characteristics, and this is considered acceptable. 
A similar rate of embolic and thrombotic events was reported in Ph+ (6.7%) and Ph- relapsed/refractory 
ALL studies (8%), with a later onset (175 days vs 22 days). The majority of events were grade ≥ 3 and 
1 event was reported as serious (2.2%). Thromboembolic events (including DIC) are already included in 
the RMP as an important potential risk. DIC is already included in the 4.4 section of the SmPC as mostly 
associated to CSR and this is acceptable. 
The incidence and types of subjects identified with experiencing at least 1 drug-related hepatotoxicity 
event was similar (24.4% versus 29.0%) in both adult relapsed/refractory ALL populations. However, 
grade ≥4 and serious events were more common in Philadelphia-positive (6.7% and 4.4%, 
respectively) than  in -negative (3% and 2.1%, respectively) relapsed/refractory ALL populations. Also 
related AST and  ALT increased (11.1% each vs 8% and 7.6, respectively, all of grade ≥ 3) were more 
common. A higher incidence of serious and grade ≥4 hepatotoxicity events is unexpected due to the 
baseline minor hepatic impairment of Ph+ adult R/R ALL subjects (AST or ALT > 3 x ULN or Total 
Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN: 6.7%) compared to Ph- adult R/R ALL subjects (AST or ALT > 3 x ULN or Total 
Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN: 16.9%). A higher incidence of serious and grade ≥4 hepatotoxicity events is 
unexpected due to the baseline minor hepatic impairment of Ph+ adult R/R ALL subjects (AST or ALT > 
3 x ULN or Total Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN: 6.7%) compared to Ph- adult R/R ALL subjects (AST or ALT > 3 
x ULN or Total Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN: 16.9%). The MAH confirmed the higher incidence of rates (more 
than double) of grade ≥ 4 and serious hepatotoxic events in Ph positive compared to Ph negative 
patients, even though no hepatotoxic events were fatal and no new safety signal was observed, which 
is reassuring. A possible explanation of this unexpected discrepancy in frequencies between the two 
populations has not been proposed by the MAH, however the above reported data have been described 
in the 4.8 section of the SmPC under the paragraph “Description of selected adverse reactions” and 
this is considered acceptable.

In Study 20120216 3 patients (6.7%) experienced no serious or fatal cardiac arrhythmia event of atrial 
fibrillation. Although, cardiac arrhythmia evens were in general more common in Philadelphia-negative 
(9.1%) compared to -positive (6.7%) relapsed/refractory ALL populations, the incidence of atrial 
fibrillation was lower in Ph- relapsed/refractory ALL patients (0.9%). Further information about the 
three patients experiencing atrial fibrillation in Study 20120216 were requested, in order to better 
understand the potential correlation to blinatumomab administration and to update the 4.8 section of 
the SmPC including also atrial fibrillation. Narratives for 3 subjects who had atrial fibrillation were 
provided. Atrial fibrillation occurred while on treatment in two patients and two days after the last dose 
of blinatumomab in the third patient (Subject 21626001001), who was the only one with a past history 
of atrial fibrillation. Blinatumomab administration was not interrupted due to these events. The 
investigator deemed each event of all three patients as non-serious and not related to blinatumomab 
and possible other contribution factors to the arrhythmia event are reported in each patient. Even if in 
principle the time to event in subject 21625003003 and subject 21633004004 (day 4 and day 8 of 
cycle 1, respectively) could suggest a possible causal relationship with blinatumomab, this hypothesis 
seems to be weakened by other past and concurrent confounding factors, age of subjects, previous 
treatment (eg. TKIs) as well as by the investigator judgment of not relationship with study drug. 
Therefore, at this time and in absence of signals from other blinatumomab studies, firm conclusion 
cannot be drawn. The MAH is recommended to follow-up these events (ADR of arrhythmia, including 
atrial fibrillation) by routine pharmacovigilance activity in the post-marketing setting across different 
Blincyto indications. 
Despite  limited  sample  size,  a  subgroup  analysis  by  age  was  provided  by  the  MAH  for  adult  RR  ALL 
patients, Phi + (study 20120216) and Phi neg (pooled studies) for the following subgroups: age, sex, 
race, region, ECOG performance status, and renal function.  
In study 20120216, the global safety profile and main AEs was similar between both age groups, except 
for febrile neutropenia (all TEAEs), surprisingly higher in non-elderly patients (33.3% vs 8.3%). While 
comparing the global safety profile among ≥65 years patients, the frequency of grade ≥3 TEAEs and 
SAEs was lower in Phi + patients (58.3% vs 88.4%; and 50.0% vs 73.9% respectively).  
Considering  AEs  of  special  interest,  among  adult  RR  Phi  +  ALL  patients  (study  20120216),  a  higher 
frequency of elevated hepatic enzymes (21.2% vs 8.3%) and febrile neutropenia (57.6% vs 16.7%) was 
noted in non-elderly patients vs elderly, while infusion reactions were higher in elderly patients (39.4 vs 
75.0%), driven by pyrexia. Comparing AEs of special interest among both age groups between Phi + 
and Phi neg patients, no significant difference was noted considering crossing CIs and limited sample 
size.  
No significant difference in safety profile was evidenced in the other subgroups analysis, among adult 
RR Phi + ALL patients as well as when compared to adult RR Phi neg ALL patients. 
The MAH summarized that three paediatric subjects with Philadelphia-positive relapsed/refractory ALL 
were enrolled in Study MT103-205. Most adverse events experienced by these subjects were grades 1 
or 2 in severity and the types of adverse events were consistent with those reported in this variation 
application. No unexpected safety signal was raised from grade 3/ 4 AEs reported in these 3 patients. 
However, no conclusion on the safety profile in this target population could be drawn based on this very 
limited safety population. 
The MAH provided pooled treatment-related safety data for the 10 subjects with Philadelphia-positive 
ALL from Studies MT103-203 and MT103-202. No new safety signal was identified in this indication.

Sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  have  been  updated  to  reflect  new  safety  information  from  this 
submission. 
2.5.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No unexpected safety signal was raised in patients from study 201202176, when compared to pooled 
safety data in adult Phi – RR ALL patients. No new safety signal was identified from the pooled treatment-
related  safety  data  for  the  10  subjects  with  Philadelphia-positive  ALL  from  Studies  MT103-203  and 
MT103-202.  
Based on the information concerning three Phi + paediatric patients, no unexpected safety signal was 
raised. However, no conclusion on the safety profile in this target population could be drawn based on 
this very limited safety population. 
The MAH will provide further safety data from the following studies as detailed in the PhV plan:  
•  Study 20180130:  Evaluation of long-term safety in pediatric patients with B-precursor ALL who 
have been treated with either blinatumomab or chemotherapy followed by transplantation. 
•  Observational Cohort Study 20170610:  Overall survival and incidence of adverse events in 
relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients after allogeneic stem

•  Observational Cohort Study 20180138:  Long-term follow-up of adult relapsed refractory 
patients enrolled in Study 00103311 
•  A Randomized, Open-label, Controlled phase 3 Adaptive Study 20120215:  A randomized, 
open-label, controlled phase 3 adaptive trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of the bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody blinatumomab as consolidation therapy 
versus conventional chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk first relapse of 
B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this extension of indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a rare aggressive cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The majority 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37563/2021 
Page 126/134 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of ALL cases are B-lineage, Philadelphia-negative ALL. The Philadelphia chromosome is observed in 3% 
to  5%  of  children  and  20%  to  30%  of  adults  with  B-cell  precursor  ALL  and  associated  with  a  poorer 
prognosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended in first remission for 
patients with Philadelphia-positive ALL. Since the introduction of TKIs, the objective response rates are 
similar between subjects with Philadelphia-negative ALL and subjects with Philadelphia-positive ALL 
(Thomas et al, 2004; Yanada and Naoe, 2006); however, duration of response and relapse-free 
survival (RFS) have remained short in ALL Phi+ patients.  
Recently,  2  non-TKI  treatments  were  approved  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  ALL  that 
included Philadelphia-positive ALL subjects in the pivotal trials. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) is 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell 
precursor ALL; adult patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL should 
have failed treatment with at least 1 TKI. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is indicated for the treatment of 
pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell ALL that is refractory, in relapse 
post-transplant, or in second or later relapse. 
With  the  limited  options  described  above,  treatment  of  Philadelphia-positive  ALL  patients  who  are 
resistant to or relapse after first-line therapy remains challenging.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main pivotal study 20120216 is a Phase 2 Single Arm, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
the BiTE® Antibody Blinatumomab in Adult Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Philadelphia Positive B-
precursor  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia  (Alcantara  Study).  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  rate  of 
CR/CRh* within the first two cycles of blinatumomab. OS, complete MRD response rate, RFS and DoR 
were investigated as secondary endpoints. A total of 45 patients were included (FAS). Only 6 of them 
could complete the end of the consolidation phase (13.3%), and 8 patients completed the study (17.8%). 
Most  of  patients  (n=37;  82.2%)  discontinued  study,  all  due  to  death.  However,  only  3  patients 
discontinued the treatment due to death. Most of treatment discontinuations were due to progression 
without prior CR/CRh/Cri (n=12), followed by requirement for alternative therapy (n=7) and intention 
to receive HSCT (n=6). 
A retrospective historical cohort was carried out in a similar population (study 20160462) and with similar 
endpoints,  in  order  to  provide  comparative  data  with  standard  of  care.  The  study  included  patients 
diagnosed between 2000 through end of data collection in 2017, and thus covered the same time period 
than  the  pivotal  study.  Most  of  patients  were  RR  to  at  least  1  G2  TKI  (94.5%).  However,  none  had 
previously received imatinib treatment. 
A Propensity Score Analysis was performed to estimate the association between receipt of blinatumomab 
and OS and CR/CRh* outcomes among patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory ALL. 
The primary endpoint of propensity score analysis was based on OS comparison.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the main pivotal study (20120216) a total of 16 patients presented with CR/CRh (35.6%; [21.9%, 
51.2%]) within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment, including 14 with CR (31.1%; [18.2-46.6]). 
One additional patient achieved a CR/CRh* after the first 2 cycles. 
Following  a  subgroup  analysis,  an  increase  in  CR/CRh  rate  was  observed  with  increasing  number  of 
previous TKI lines, from 14.3% with 1TKI, 33.3% with 2 TKI up to 47.1% with 3 TKI. CI remained over 
the 10 % cut-off in subgroups with 2 and 3 TKI. These results, added to current treatment guidelines in 
ALL Phi + patients, reinforce the limited target indication after at least 2 TKI. 
MRD response was coherent with results obtained with the primary endpoint, with 40% of patients in 
MRD response, all MRD CR. 12/14 patients in CR achieved MRD CR, and 2/2 in CRh achieved MRD CR. 
MRD CR was also observed in 4 patients who did not achieve CR/CRh.  
Estimated median RFS from the 16 patients who achieved CR/CRh* after 2 cycles was 6.8 months (95% 
CI: 4.4, NE). Five subjects (31.3%) remained relapse free at the time of last response evaluation. 
Median time to haematological relapse in CR/CRh patients was coherent with RFS results (6.8 months; 
95% CI: 4.5, NE). 
Median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 5.7, 13.5), with 8 patients alive at the time of the last follow-up 
date and a median FU of 25.1 months. Among the 10 patients with T315i Bcr-abl mutation, median OS 
was 12.7 months [4.2, 18.1]. 
Subgroups  analysis  also  showed  an  increasing  median  OS  with increasing  number  of  prior  TKI, up  to 
12.6 months [4.2, 20.6] in patients with 3 or more prior TKIs. 
A total of 9 subjects (9/45, 20.0%) had an allogeneic HSCT during the study, including 7 who achieved 
CR/CRh* in the first 2 cycles (7/16 subjects, 43.8%). The KM estimate of median survival after HSCT 
was 15.9 months (95% CI: 2.1, 16.9). 
A historical control study (Study 20160462) and a propensity score analysis were conducted to estimate 
the effects of blinatumomab compared with standard of care ALL therapy for treatment of Philadelphia-
positive relapsed/refractory ALL. Balance between 20120216 population and 20160462 was obtained by 
applying inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) calculated from a propensity score model. In 
order to avoid statistical limitations due to limited sample size in both studies, a Bayesian augmentation 
approach was applied to the endpoint analyses, using key efficacy outcomes from a previous randomized 
trial in adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory subjects, Study 00103311. 
Based on non-Bayes IPTW for OS, adjusted hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.15). Once Bayes-
augmented, adjusted hazard ratio reached significant value of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.96), in favour of 
blinatumomab treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No difference in median OS was observed with or without censoring at time of HSCT. Uncertainty remains 
on a risk of detrimental long term effect of blinatumomab treatment on OS after HSCT considering also 
that  all  4  patients  who  received  HSCT  without  additional  treatment  had  died  at  17  months. 
Study 20170610  will  provide  more  data  on  the  overall  survival  in  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant: induction with blinatumomab 
vs chemotherapy (see RMP).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The MAH provided safety data in adult RR Phi + ALL patients, and pooled safety data in adult RR Phi neg 
ALL patients. 
In study 20120216, all 45 patients presented with at least 1 TEAE, including 28 subjects with serious 
TEAE  (62.2%).  Most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  pyrexia  (57.8%),  febrile  neutropenia  (40.0%), 
headache (31.1%), anaemia (28.9%), thrombocytopenia (22.2%), bone pain (20.0%), and diarrhoea 
(20.0%). The safety profile raised in RR Phi + adults ALL patients in study 20120216 was similar to RR 
Phi neg adults ALL pooled patients. It should anyway be noted that the frequency of febrile neutropenia 
was higher in Phi + subjects (40.0% vs 24.4%).  
In study 20120216, the most frequently reported grade 3/ 4 TEAEs were febrile neutropenia (26.7%), 
thrombocytopenia (22.2%), anaemia (15.6%), and pyrexia, ALT increased and AST increased (11.1% 
each). The safety profile remained similar in terms of grade 3/ 4 AEs between adult RR ALL Phi + and 
Phi neg patients. However, the frequency of grade 3 /4 thrombocytopenia was higher in Phi + patients 
(22.2 vs 12.3%) while a higher frequency of grade 3 /4 neutropenia was observed in Phi neg patients 
(6.7 vs 16.3%). 
In  RR  adult  Phi  +  ALL  (study  20120216),  the  frequency  of  treatment-related AEs  was  91.1%,  higher 
than in pooled adult RR Phi neg patients (84.7%), with a similar trend in related AEs reported except for 
the higher frequency of related febrile neutropenia (24.4 vs 12.7%).  
A total of 6 fatal AEs were reported, including 1 case of treatment-related fatal sepsis. 62.2% of patients 
presented with SAEs, driven by febrile neutropenia (8.9%), sepsis, device related infection and tremor 
(6.7% each). When compared to adult RR Phi neg ALL pooled patients, no unexpected trend in SAEs was 
reported, nor new safety signal. 
No  unexpected  trend  in  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruption  was  observed  in  study  20120216,  nor 
when comparing both Phi + and Phi neg RR ALL adult populations. 
Prespecified AESIs were neurologic events, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, elevated liver 
enzymes,  infusion  reactions,  tumor  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  capillary  leak  syndrome  (CLS),  medication 
errors,  decreased 
immunoglobulins,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  (including  disseminated 
intravascular 
coagulation 
[DIC]), 
leukoencephalopathy 
including 
progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia,  lymphopenia,  immunogenicity,  and 
pancreatitis. Additionally, the following minimum critical toxicities were reviewed: bone marrow toxicity 
(cytopenias),  hepatotoxicity,  nephrotoxicity,  and  torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation,  cardiac 
arrhythmias, and convulsion.  
Overall, no unexpected safety signal was raised from these AESIs and critical toxicities. 
A similar rate of embolic and thrombotic events were reported in Ph+ (6.7%) and Ph- relapsed/refractory 
ALL studies (8%), with a later onset (175 days vs 22 days). The majority of events were grade ≥ 3 and 
1 event was reported as serious (2.2%). Thromboembolic events (including DIC) are included in the RMP 
as an important potential risk.  
In Study 20120216 3 patients (6.7%) experienced non serious or fatal cardiac arrhythmia event of 
atrial fibrillation. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was lower in Ph- relapsed/refractory ALL patients 
(0.9%). 
Overall safety of Blincyto in this study was in line with the known safety profile for Blincyto.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
This safety assessment is based on indirect comparison with known safety profile for blinatumomab in 
pooled adult RR Phi neg ALL patients, due to the non-comparative design of the pivotal study for this 
extension of indication in adult RR Phi + ALL patients. Moreover, the interpretation of the safety data 
and the comparison between the adult Ph-positive and Ph-negative relapsed/refractory ALL populations 
is limited by the low number of patients included in Study 20120216. 
Regarding TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 3 patients (6.7%) presented with such TEAEs in 
study 20120216, including 2 related TEAEs neutropenia and a case of acute graft versus host disease. A 
non-interventional PASS is planned (20170610) in US and EU, which will cover the risk: “100-day survival 
and  risk  of  developing  acute  graft  versus  host  disease  (aGvHD)  in  relapsed/refractory  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  after  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant:  blinatumomab  vs  chemotherapy 
induction” (see RMP). 
The  observed  higher  incidence  of  serious  and  grade  ≥4  hepatotoxicity  events  in  Ph+  ALL  patients  is 
unexpected due to the baseline minor hepatic impairment of Ph+ adult R/R ALL subjects compared to 
Ph- adult R/R ALL subjects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based on 45 patients included in the pivotal, single-arm study, CR/CRh was obtained in 35.6% of patients 
[21.9%, 51.2%] within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment, including 31.1% with CR [18.2-
46.6].  Estimated median RFS from the 16 patients who achieved CR/CRh* after 2 cycles was 6.8 months 
(95% CI: 4.4, NE). Five subjects (31.3%) remained relapse free at the time of last response evaluation. 
Median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 5.7, 13.5), with 8 patients alive at the time of the last follow-up 
date and a median FU of 25.1 months. A total of 9 subjects (9/45, 20.0%) had an allogeneic HSCT during 
the study. The KM estimate of median survival after HSCT was 15.9 months (95% CI: 2.1, 16.9).  
No unexpected safety signal was raised in patients from study 201202176, when compared to pooled 
safety data in adult Phi – RR ALL patients. Overall safety of Blincyto in this study was in line with the 
known safety profile of the product. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the unmet medical need for the treatment of Philadelphia-positive ALL adult patients who 
are resistant to or relapse after first-line therapy and despite the methodological limitations of the non-
comparative study the clinical relevance of results presented in these patients is endorsed.  
Risk benefit balance of Blincyto in the claimed indication in RR Phi + adult patients is considered positive 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
NA 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Blincyto as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with Phi + RR ALL who 
have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment 
options is positive. 
The overall B/R of Blincyto for the treatment as monotherapy of paediatric patients with Philadelphia-
positive relapsed/refractory ALL remains undetermined. 
The  overall  B/R  of  Blincyto  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients  in  first or  second hematologic  CR  with 
Philadelphia-positive MRD-positive ALL remains undetermined.

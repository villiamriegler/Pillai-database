COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE  
POST-AUTHORISATION SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for  
TORISEL 
International Nonproprietary Name (INN): temsirolimus  
On 23 July 2009 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion**  to  recommend  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal 
product Torisel. The Marketing Authorisation Holder for this medicinal product is Wyeth Europa Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows:  
’’Torisel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma [MCL]’’. 
The opinion on this type II variation also includes a recommendation from the CHMP that one 
additional year of marketing protection be granted***, because the Committee concluded that the new 
therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies, based 
on improved efficacy. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) which will be published in the revised European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR) and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Torisel will be as follows****: 
Renal cell carcinoma  
Torisel is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
who have at least three of six prognostic risk factors (see section 5.1).  
Mantle cell lymphoma 
Torisel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle 
cell lymphoma [MCL], (see section 5.1).

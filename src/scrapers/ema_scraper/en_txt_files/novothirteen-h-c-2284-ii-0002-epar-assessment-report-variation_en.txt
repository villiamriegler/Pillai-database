The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of bleeding in children with 
congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency below 6 years of age. Consequently, the MAH proposed the 
update of section 4.1 of the SmPC. In addition, the MAH proposed to update the posology, safety, efficacy 
and pharmacokinetics information regarding the patient population below 6 years of age in sections 4.2, 
4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC, respectively, and to add a recommendation for the dilution of the 
reconstituted product for patients less than 24 kg in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 
9.0.  
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0001/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), corresponding to PIP procedure 
number EMEA-000185-PIP01-08-M05. 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-000185-PIP01-08-M05 was not yet completed. 
The PDCO issued a letter on partial compliance for the PIP C2-000185-PIP01-08-M05. Study F13CD-3720

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
NovoThirteen (catridecacog) is a recombinant DNA- based coagulation FXIII (consisting on a dimer of two 
FXIII A-subunits) which is identical in structure to the human FXIII A-subunit. NovoThirteen is indicated 
for the long-term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in patients 6 years and above with congenital factor 
XIII A-subunit deficiency. 
Congenital coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with 
an estimated prevalence of 1 per 2 to 5 million individuals. There are two phenotypic classes of congenital 
FXIII deficiency, either affecting the A-subunit or the B-subunit of FXIII. Approximately 95 per cent of all 
known cases of congenital FXIII deficiency are due to mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic A-
subunit. In either subtype of FXIII deficiency, the affected individuals have an increased tendency to 
bleed, with a high rate of severe and life-threatening bleeding episodes such as intracranial haemorrhage.  
Diagnosis is based on quantitative FXIII activity measurement and antigen assays. Common clotting 
assays such as activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) are normal and 
cannot be used for the screening. The clot solubility test may also be used (clot is stable for less than 24 
hours in case of FXIII deficiency). However, the assay is qualitative, and when performed correctly the 
test is positive only when the FXIII activity in the sample is close to zero. Differential diagnoses mainly 
include the other congenital coagulation factor deficiencies: fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, X, XI, VIII and 
IX. Antenatal diagnosis is possible if the causal mutations have previously been identified in the family.  
Congenital factor XIII deficiency is characterised by haemorrhagic diathesis frequently associated with 
spontaneous abortions and defective wound healing. Congenital FXIII deficiency can manifest at any age, 
but diagnosis is often made during infancy. Umbilical stump bleeding manifests in up to 80% of the 
patients. Other common signs include intracranial haemorrhage (25-30%), soft tissue bleeding, bruising, 
haemarthroses (20%), and recurrent spontaneous abortions. In most cases, haemorrhages are delayed 
(12-36hr) after trauma or surgery. Patients may have poor wound healing.  
This variation application was submitted to extend the current indication to young children below 6 years 
of age. In support of this application, the MAH submitted a clinical PK/safety study (F13CD-3760) 
performed on a paediatric population aged from 1 to 5 years. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In accordance with an EMA Paediatric Investigation Plan commitment, a single-dose trial specifically 
designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of rFXIII in children less than 6 years old 
with congenital FXIII deficiency (F13CD-3760) was submitted in support of this extension of indication 
application. Inclusion into a long-term safety follow-on trial (F13CD-3835) was offered to those children 
who completed the F13CD-3760 trial. Finally, a phase 4, post-marketing observational study is  ongoing 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 6/26 
  
  
as part of the pharmacovigilance plan to substantiate the safety profile of rFXIII after marketing 
authorisation.  
These studies are part of the clinical development programme for recombinant human coagulation factor 
XIII in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. This included five phase 1 studies (NN1841-
3788, F13-1661 and F13-1662, F13-1663 and NN1810-3733) supporting the congenital FXIII deficiency 
indication, one in patients and four in healthy subjects including a study in Japanese subjects and a 
bioequivalence study. Therapeutic confirmatory studies comprise a pivotal phase 3 study of monthly 
administration of 35 IU/kg rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency (study F13CD-
1725). An extension study to the pivotal study is still ongoing (study F13CD-3720).  
In addition, two trials have been initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rFXIII in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. 
The five phase 1 trials were conducted in Europe (NN1841-3788, F13-1661 and F13-1662), US (F13-
1663) and Japan (NN1810-3733). The paediatric trial (F13CD-3760) was conducted in UK, US and Israel. 
Trials F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720 (Phase 3) were conducted in Europe, US, Canada and Israel. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in Paediatric Patients with Congenital FXIII Deficiency (study F13CD-3760) 
Methods – Analysis of data submitted 
The pharmacokinetics of FXIII in paediatric patients (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII 
deficiency was assessed after a single intravenous (IV) dose of rFXIII 35 IU/kg (study F13CD-3760). The 
phase III study was open-label and PK and safety were evaluated.  
The objectives of the study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To characterise the PK of rFXIII in children (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII A-
subunit deficiency following a single IV dose administration by measuring the area under the 
concentration vs. time curve (AUC0-30 days) (IU×h/mL). (Primary objective)  
To investigate additional PK parameters and to evaluate the safety of a single IV dose of rFXIII in 
children (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. (Secondary 
objectives). 
The patients included were 3 boys and 3 girls, 3 children were Asian, 2 children were White and 1 child 
was Black/African American. The mean age was 2.7 years. 
All children had been on monthly prophylactic treatment with a FXIII containing product (Fibrogammin 
P/Corifact) prior to inclusion in the study.  
The trial included one screening visit, one dosing visit including PK assessments up to 24 hours and four 
follow-up visits at 7, 14, 21 and 30 days after trial product administration. Blood samples for the PK 
assessments were drawn pre-dose and at 30 minutes, 24 hours, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days after dosing. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 7/26 
  
  
end-of-trial visit was 30 days after dosing where PK and general safety parameters were assessed, 
including anti-rFXIII antibodies. 
The children who completed the present trial were offered participation in a safety extension trial (F13CD-
3835: an open-label, single-arm and multiple dose trial on safety and efficacy of monthly replacement 
therapy with rFXIII in children with congenital FXIII deficiency). 
Results 
A dose regimen of 35 IU/kg once monthly resulted in increased FXIII activities to well within the normal 
range at the time of injection and maintaining the activity level above 10% throughout the entire course 
of the treatment. The mean trough FXIII activity level at 30 days post-dose (0.21 IU/mL) was almost 
identical to the pre-dose level (0.20 IU/mL). Individual profiles of FXIII activity are presented in Figure 1 
below. 
After dosing, rFXIII rapidly binds to excess free B-subunit in the blood. As expected, the concentration of 
free B-subunit in the 6 children decreased after dosing, and then rapidly increased to pre-dose levels 
(reaching 77% of the pre-dose level during the first 24 h). Importantly, and similar to previous trials, free 
B-subunit was still measurable in plasma at 30 min following dosing of rFXIII (35 IU/kg), meaning that 
the B-subunit was not saturated by administration of rFXIII 35 IU/kg.

Deficiency Following a Single Dose of rFXIII – Trial F13CD 3760 
The pharmacokinetic endpoints are summarised in table 2 below. The mean t ½ of FXIII was 15.8 days 
(range: 10–25 days) in children. In adult patients (study F13CD-1725), the estimated mean t ½ was 12 
days (range: 7.5–18.5 days). This was consistent with a mean t ½ of 13 days for healthy subjects (study 
NN1841-3788). Although the observed difference in t ½ between children and adults was not statistically 
significant, a potentially higher t ½ in children could be anticipated due to the fact that CL and Vss are not 
perfectly linear with body weight. 
The mean CL in children was 0.15 ml/h/kg and consistent with results in healthy adult subjects 
(NN1841-3788: mean 0.14 mL/h/kg). In contrast, the mean Vss was 89.9 mL/kg in children and hence 
markedly greater than in healthy adult subjects with endogenous FXIII A subunit and thus a different Vss

(NN1841-3788: mean 48 mL/kg). CL and Vss were not calculated for F13CD-1725 (phase 3, efficacy 
study). 
As expected, the Cmax was observed at the first assessment at 30 minutes just after the IV dosing. 
Hereafter, a linear decline over time was observed. The mean Cmax was 0.69 IU/mL. This Cmax in children 
was slightly lower than the Cmax observed in adult patients (F13CD-1725: mean 0.76 IU/mL) and in 
healthy subjects (NN1841-3788: mean 0.87 IU/mL).

PK endpoints derived from Berichrom activity assay. 
Systemic exposure was consistent with results from previous clinical trials with rFXIII. The mean AUC0-30 
days was 250 h*IU/mL in children, mean AUC0-28 days was 248 h*IU/mL in adult patients (F13CD-1725) and 
mean AUC0-∞ was 301 h*IU/mL in healthy subjects (NN1841-3788). 
Some variation in estimates was observed across trials, which is to be expected given the degree of inter-
subject variation in pharmacokinetics and the relatively few number of subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable across age groups in the paediatric PK study (F13CD- 
3760) and in the phase 3 study (F13CD-1725) (see Table 3). In F13CD-1725, C max was 0.75 IU/mL in 
those aged 6–11 years, 0.67 IU/mL in those aged 12–17 years, and 0.76 IU/mL in those over 18 years. 
Trough levels were also comparable across age groups: 0.20 IU/mL in F13CD-3760 and 0.17–0.20 IU/mL 
in different age groups in the F13CD-1725. A comparable T1/2 was observed across age groups: 15.0 
days in F13CD-3760 vs. 11.6–12.4 days in the different age groups in F13CD-1725.

Results from the F13CD-3720 PK-study are also shown in Table 3. In total, 16 of the 23 patients in the 
F13CD-3720 trial were part of the F13CD-1725 trial. PK-parameters in F13CD-3720 were comparable to 
the PK-parameters in F13CD-3760. 
An analysis was submitted where all the patients in the three trials have been divided into three age 
groups (Table 4). 
Table 4: Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters for different age groups across trials 
Non-compartmental PK parameters (Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0-28/30d, T1/2) were comparable across the three 
age groups. Post-hoc, pairwise t-tests across the age groups of logtransformed data did not demonstrate 
any statistically significant differences, when adjusting p values for multiple testing. Additionally, separate 
ANOVA analyses of each of the parameters, showed no significant differences across the groups (data not 
shown). The geometric mean half-life ranged from 11.6 to 15.0 days, and the trough FXIII activity levels 
ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 IU/mL. The geometric mean recoveries were also in the same range; 0.015 
(F13CD-1725), 0.013 (F13CD-3760) and 0.020 (F13CD-3720) (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). 
Furthermore, mean PK profiles were comparable for the three trials, and Cmax and Ctrough values, as well 
as FXIII exposures (AUC), were constant over time, based on results from patients participating in both 
the F13CD-1725 and the F13CD-3720 trial. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted in support to this extension of indication. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As indicated in the introduction, the MAH submitted results from the whole clinical development 
programme. Nevertheless only data submitted in support to this application to extend the use of 
Novothirteen in children below 6 years of age are assessed in this report. 
Although conducted in a limited number of patients, the outcome of F13CD-3760 study allows a reliable 
characterisation of rFXIII PK parameters in the paediatric patients < 6 years old. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 10/26 
 
  
  
PK data in healthy subjects and patients > 6 years have already been assessed in the frame of the initial 
marketing authorisation application (MAA). However, it should be reminded that, at the time of initial 
MAA, questions remained on the full PK assessment of the monthly 35UI/kg dose which is currently 
approved in patients > 6 years. Indeed, as no PK data with this dosing were formally assessed in patients 
> 6 years and considering that the available data from study F13CD-3720 showed that the target level of 
rFXIII (10% of plasma level in non-deficient patients at day 28 post administration) was not achieved in 
approximately 5 % of patients, the MAH was requested to collect full PK data of the 35IU/kg/month dose 
in at least 5 patients enrolled in the extension F13CD-3720 study. A separate steady-state PK assessment 
was performed on a subset of 23 patients, and a full report has been produced. 
Based on the whole PK data, the systemic exposure observed in young paediatric patients is considered 
consistent with that observed in patients > 6 years and supports the claimed dosing scheme of 
35UI/kg/month in patients < 6 years old. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The provided PK data supports the claimed dosing scheme in children below 6 years of age. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No specific efficacy data have been provided for young children < 6 years old as only the phase 3b 
paediatric PK/safety study (F13CD-3760) – detailed in clinical pharmacology -  has been submitted in 
support of this application. However, all the 6 patients enrolled in this completed study entered an on-
going safety and efficacy extension trial (F13CD-3835) where an I.V. dose of 35 IU/kg rFXIII is 
administered every 4 weeks over a period of a minimum of 1 year. During the follow-up period until 15 
January 2013 there were no treatment requiring bleeding episodes among the children enrolled in the 
F13CD-3835 study. The F13CD-3835 extension trial will continue until Q3 2014 and after that date, the 
children will be offered participation in the F13CD-3868 PASS study, where follow-up data regarding 
safety and efficacy will continue to be collected and thus, will be available in the future. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As the safety/efficacy extension study F13CD-3835 in children below 6 years of age is still on-going, the 
MAH only provided a brief summary of interim efficacy results. This analysis, which covers data from 6 
patients monthly treated with 35 IU/kg of rFXIII, does not seem to identify efficacy issues in the age 
group of children below 6 years of age. Indeed, no lack of efficacy, no breakthrough bleedings, was 
observed during this extension study.  
Thus, the MAH proposed to extrapolate the efficacy data from adults to children on the basis that 
paediatric PK profile of NovoThirteen appears comparable between these both populations. 
Longer-term efficacy data from the extension study F13CD-3835 in children below 6 years of age, as well 
as efficacy data from older children (from 6 to 18 years old) through the extension study F13CD-3720 will 
be submitted by the MAH when the F13CD-3835 and F13CD-3720 clinical study reports will be finalised in 
May 2015 and October 2016, respectively. 
Moreover, it should be noted that congenital coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is often diagnosed 
during infancy, especially in the age range of 0-6 years, when an umbilical stump bleeding or intracranial 
haemorrhage occur for example. In this context, when the diagnosis is made, the patient should be 
treated in emergency with FXIII containing products, such as FXIII concentrate or fresh frozen plasma, 
before initiating a prophylactic treatment which is standard of care. In addition, it should be highlighted 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 11/26 
  
  
that, in general, young children are more likely to present traumatic bleedings due to frequent falls or 
bruises. Despite the rarity of the disease and its specific bleeding pattern (incidence much lower than with 
other coagulation disorders), it appears crucial to collect data on the bleedings treatment in the young 
children population where treatment requiring bleedings are more likely to occur (i.e. at the time of 
diagnosis or during daily life). Therefore, the MAH committed to collect information concerning the 
efficacy and safety of rFXIII for the treatment of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis through the 
observational PASS study NN1841-3868. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In relation to the efficacy of NovoThirteen in the proposed patient population for this extension of 
indication, the CHMP considered that the provided data are sufficient. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
To support the safety of NovoThirteen in patients below 6 years old, safety data from the paediatric 
PK/safety study F13CD-3760 performed on 6 patients have been provided by the MAH. However, the MAH 
did not submit an interim report of the ongoing paediatric extension trial F13CD-3835 but only provided 
raw safety data. 
To further support the findings of study F13CD-3760, an overview of the whole safety data collected 
throughout the clinical development programme (with a cut-off date of 11 February 2011 for ongoing 
studies) has been briefly summarised and submitted by the MAH. 
Safety data on patients between 1 and 5 years old 
F13CD-3760: PK and safety study 
The completed F13CD-3760 clinical study evaluated pharmacokinetics and safety in 6 children between 1 
and 5 years old who received one single IV dose of rFXIII (at the dose of 35IU/kg).  
The patients included were 3 boys and 3 girls, 3 children were Asian, 2 children were White and 1 child 
was Black/African American. The mean age was 2.7 years (range: 1 to 4 years), the mean weight was 
16.4 (from 13.7 to 23.2) kg and the mean height was 98.9 (from 89 to 113) cm. 
Adverse events were recorded from dosing until 30 days after dosing. Antibodies against rFXIII were 
measured pre-dose (Visit 2, 30 minutes prior to dosing) and at Visit 6 (30 days after dosing). 
Two mild treatment-emergent adverse events (pyrexia and pain in extremity/arm) were the only reported 
adverse events following exposure to rFXIII and were considered unlikely related to rFXIII (by the 
investigator and the MAH): 
• 
• 
An event of pyrexia occurred 29 days after rFXIII exposure with a duration of 2 days in a 1 year old 
male, 
An event of pain in the arm occurred 4 days after rFXIII exposure with a duration of 68 days in a 3 
years old male. 
Both children recovered from adverse events. No antibodies against rFXIII were detected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 12/26 
  
  
For 5 of the 6 children, no changes in physical examinations were observed during the trial and 1 scratch 
on the skin was reported 7 days post-dose in 1 child. 
No deaths, serious adverse events or adverse event withdrawals were reported during this period. No 
probably or possibly rFXIII-related adverse events were reported. No treatment-requiring bleeding 
episodes occurred. 
Overall, no clinically relevant changes have been observed for parameters of haematology, biochemistry 
and urinalysis. 
F13CD-3835: extension study 
All the 6 children from F13CD-3760 study completed the trial and continued in the ongoing safety 
extension trial (F13CD-3835) where an IV dose of 35 IU/kg rFXIII was given every 4 weeks over a period 
of a minimum of 1 year. 
At the time of the 1-year interim report for this extension study (cut-off date: 15 January 2013), 6 
children (3 males and 3 females) were enrolled in the study. As of 15 January 2013, no anti-rFXIII 
antibodies, allergic reactions, embolic or thrombotic events or lack of efficacy were reported. In addition, 
there were no treatment requiring bleeding episodes as per 15 January 2013. In total, 52 adverse events 
were reported in 6 subjects. None of the adverse events were assessed by the investigator to be possibly 
or probably related to rFXIII. All events were reported as recovered. The most frequently reported 
adverse events in F13CD-3835 were diarrhoea, headache, fall and upper respiratory tract infection. 
Out of the 52 adverse events, 2 adverse events from the same female subject were reported as serious 
adverse events (SAEs), reported at an age of 4 and 5 years of age respectively. The 2 SAEs were from 
one report of head injury as a result of a fall whilst playing and another report of head injury as a result 
of falling from a bed. Blood samples were obtained and computerized tomography scan was performed. 
All laboratory data and investigations were within normal limits. In both reported SAEs, the subject 
recovered on the next day and was discharged from hospital. All events were assessed to be unlikely 
related to rFXIII by both investigator and the MAH. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In this application to extend the current approved indication to patients aged less than 6 years old, safety 
data already submitted at the time of the initial marketing authorisation were briefly summarised. In 
addition safety results on 6 patients aged 1 to 5 years old included in the pharmacokinetics and safety 
study (F13CD-3760) were provided and did not reveal special safety concerns. An interim report with 
safety results from the ongoing F13CD-3835 extension study was not provided. However, based on the 
raw data, the MAH stated that from the period of the supplied data from the F13CD-3835 and F13CD-
3720 studies (cut-off dates were 15 January 2013 and 11 February 2011 respectively) until December 
2013, no new adverse events or no new late breaking safety information has been reported that would 
modify the overall safety profile or the benefit-risk balance for rFXIII. 
Due to the small volume of NovoThirteen calculated to be administered to paediatric patients weighing 
less than 24 kg if using the method of administration approved at the time of the initial MAA, the MAH 
was requested to justify the absence of an appropriate presentation and the proposed modified dilution 
instruction for children with a body weight of less than 24 kg. More specifically, the MAH was requested to 
give an estimate on how large the patient population with a body weight of less than 24 kg is and to 
justify the chosen dilution volume and dilution solution. The justification had to be provided based on the 
clinical experience obtained with the product thus diluted, on the stability of drug substance in dilution 
and on the degree of absorption to plastic syringe. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014

According to the World Federation of Haemophilia Annual Global Survey 2011 (Report on the annual 
global survey 2011, World Federation of Haemophilia 2012), the global prevalence of Factor XIII 
congenital deficiency is 1,054. The worldwide prevalence of diagnosed Factor XIII deficiency is estimated 
at around 1 case per 5 million, but varies from a low of 0.2 per 10 million in South East Asia, to a high of 
15 per 10 million in Canada. 
Factor XIII A-subunit deficiency is a congenital disease and thereby present at birth, although some 
patients may not be diagnosed until later in life. No information about birth incidence is available, neither 
can published information be found about age distribution. However, Factor XIII A-subunit congenital 
deficiency is an underdiagnosed disease, and is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 in 1- 3 million 
individuals (Ichinose et al, 2005). 
The total population in the EU is an estimated 500 million. In 2011, 5.2 million children were born in the 
EU, thus it can be expected that 2-5 children will be born with Factor XIII A-subunit deficiency per year in 
the EU area (estimated birth incidence). 
A normal weight child would weigh 24 kg when around 7 years of age. In the EU, an estimated 7.5% of 
the population is below 7 years of age (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu), thus the patient population 
with a body weight of 24 kg or below is 7.5% of 500 million, i.e. 37.5 million. Assuming that a maximum 
of 1 per million of these children below 7 years of age would have Factor XIII A-subunit congenital 
deficiency that would amount to a prevalence of 37 children with a body weight of 24 kg or less with 
Factor XIII A-subunit deficiency in the EU area. 
Clinical experience with the diluted product 
According to protocol and TMM (Trial Material Manual) Appendix B for F13CD-3760 and F13CD-3835 all 
product must be diluted with 6 ml NaCl prior to administration. Thus the entire 122 exposures (cut-off 30 
Sept. 2012) in these 2 trials constitute experience with the further diluted product. No safety concerns 
have been identified. One event of Infusion site infiltration has been reported as a medication error. A 2 
year old 14.5 kg boy experienced an IV infiltration after 0.8 ml of infusion of a planned 1.8 ml dose. The 
investigator reported the event to be unlikely related to the trial product. This event cannot be attributed 
to the further dilution of the product. No other reports of medication error have been associated with the 
product following further dilution. 
Stability of drug substance in dilution 
The MAH had submitted an in-use stability report during the assessment of the initial MAA. The report 
included results from an in-use stability study for the rFXIII 2500 IU reconstituted product as well as the 
product diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride stored 48 hours at 5ºC and 24 hours at 25ºC. The conclusion 
from the report was that no degradation or change in any parameters is observed during the proposed in-
use period 24 hours at 5ºC ± 3ºC or 3 hours at maximum 25ºC. 
Degree of absorption to plastic syringe 
NovoThirteen is not supplied with a syringe in the carton and the MAH as such does not have any data to 
support absorption of NovoThirteen to plastic syringes. However, all utensils in the EU have to be CE 
marked. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic data from the clinical trial F13CD-3760 in children below 6 years it is 
concluded that no dose adjustment is needed as there is no influence of age on the pharmacokinetics of 
NovoThirteen. No measurable effect from theoretical absorption of protein to the syringe material was 
observed. Therefore there is no reason to suspect that the further diluted NovoThirteen should have been 
absorbed to the plastic syringe. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 14/26 
  
  
In conclusion, no safety issues have been identified by the MAH in the on-going F13CD-3835 study in 
patients below 6 years of age. 
The MAH has provided sufficient data in order to justify the absence of an appropriate presentation and a 
proposed dilution instruction for patients with body weight less than 24 kg. 
In addition, the CHMP recommended that the applicant should submit the following data regarding the 
safety concern about medication error related to reconstitution and administration: 
- in-use stability data at the start and the end of the approved shelf life of 2 years using at least one 
batch of “rFXIII 2500 IU diluted”. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of NovoThirteen in patients aged less than 6 years is considered similar to the safety 
profile in patients above 6 years of age. 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 31 January 2014.  
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10.3, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for CATRIDECACOG (NOVOTHIRTEEN) in the treatment of the 
proposed/approved indication is acceptable. The following points should be taken into account in the next 
update: 
1-  The MAH is requested to update exposure data with the number of patients exposed to rFXIII in 
the ulcerative colitis NN8717-3946 trial with the next RMP update. 
2-  The MAH is requested to update the PASS status in section 2.5.5 with the next RMP update. 
In addition, the following points need to be addressed by the MAH before CHMP Opinion: 
1-  The MAH is requested to consider the following modifications: 
a.  In the Physician Brochure 
“The dose volume in millilitres should be calculated based on body weight for each patient using the following formula for patients 
weighing 24 kg or more: 
Dose volume in ml = 0.042 x subject bw (kg)” 
b.  In the Patient Brochure 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 15/26 
  
  
“NovoThirteen is used to prevent bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency. Use of NovoThirteen® for 
other purposes like treatment of breakthrough bleedings in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency is not part of the 
approved indication. 
This is considered off-label use and is not approved by the Health Authority in Europe. This is because the safety and efficacy of 
NovoThirteen® when used in this way have not been established.” 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The MAH proposed updates of the Patient and the Physician Brochures in order to minimize the risk of 
medication error related to the dilution of the vial for small children weighing less than 24 Kg. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product 
in the proposed indication(s), provided that the requested modifications of the Patient and Physician 
Brochures are considered before CHMP adoption. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. The requested modifications of the Patient and Physician 
Brochures were implemented as proposed by the PRAC. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been 
updated (new wording underlined, old strikethrough). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
SmPC section 4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Long term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in adult and paediatric patients 6 years and above with 
congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency. 
SmPC section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Based on the actual concentration of NovoThirteen, the dose volume (in millilitres) to be administered to 
patients weighing at least 24 kg can be calculated from the formula below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 21/26 
 
  
  
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NovoThirteen in children less than 6 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
No dose adjustment is required when NovoThirteen is used in paediatric patients and the dose of 35 
IU/kg body weight should be used (see section 5.2 ‘Paediatric population’).  
However, if the paediatric patient weighs less than 24 kg, the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be 
diluted with 6.0 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection to handle the dosing of small children 
(see section 6.6 ‘Special precautions for disposal and other handling – Use in the paediatric population’). 
The dose volume for the reconstituted NovoThirteen diluted with 6.0 ml sodium chloride 0.9% solution for 
injection can be calculated by using the below formula: 
Dose volume in ml = 0.117* x body weight in kilograms. 
*The calculation of the correction factor 0.117 is related to the exact quantity of the product and not the 
nominal value of the product. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
In clinical trials, NovoThirteen has been administered to 5156 patients with congenital factor XIII A-
subunit deficiency (1043924 doses of NovoThirteen). 15 patients were between the age of 6 to less than 
18 years old and 6 patients were less than 6 years old (total of 393 exposures of NovoThirteen in 
paediatric subjects (less than 18 years old). 
[…] 
In clinical studies, adverse reactions were more frequently reported in patients aged from 6 to less than 
18 years old than in adults. 4 patients (25%) underaged between 6 and 18 years experienced serious 
adverse reactions in comparison to 3 patients over 18 years (8.5%) that experienced serious adverse 
reactions. Four cases of non-neutralising antibodies were reported at the start of the treatment in 
patients from 6 tounder 18 years of age. 3 of these patients discontinued the study due to the adverse 
reaction. 
In patients below 6 years, no anti-rFXIII antibodies, no thromboembolic adverse events or other safety 
issues were reported. 
SmPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
NovoThirteen in one or more subsets of the paediatric population with factor XIII congenital 
deficiency.Analyses of data from paediatric patients included in clinical trials have not identified 
differences in treatment response according to age. 
Fifteen children between the age of 6 to less than 18 years old and six children less than 6 years old have 
been treated with NovoThirteen for a total of 393 exposures.  
Children above 6 years were investigated through the pivotal phase 3 trial (F13CD-1725) and the on-
going extension study (F13CD-3720) assessing the safety of monthly replacement therapy with 
NovoThirteen. 
The 6 patients below 6 years were investigated through a single dose pharmacokinetic phase 3b trial 
(F13CD-3760) and then, included in the on-going long-term follow-up trial (F13CD-3835) assessing the 
safety and the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with NovoThirteen. No treatment requiring 
bleeding episodes have been detected in patients below 6 years during 8.7 years of cumulative follow-up, 
representing a total of 116 doses. The suggested dose of 35 IU/kg has shown to be appropriate to 
provide haemostatic coverage in this young population. 
SmPC section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paediatric population 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 22/26 
  
  
In a pharmacokinetic trial 6 children (age 1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII A-subunit 
deficiency were exposed to one single i.v. dose of NovoThirteen 35 IU/kg. The mean t½ of FXIII was 
approximately 15 days (range: 10 to 25 days). In this trial, the mean clearance in children was 0.15 
ml/h/kg. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The MAH provided results from a phase 3b single dose PK/safety (F13CD-3760) study performed on 6 
patients aged from 1 to 5 years. Moreover, results from the F13CD-3720 PK sub-study performed on 
patients above 6 years were submitted. Based on the whole PK data, the systemic exposure observed in 
young paediatric patients is considered consistent with that observed in patients > 6 years and supports 
the claimed dosing scheme of 35UI/kg/month in patients < 6 years old. 
In addition, the MAH provided a brief summary of interim results from the on-going safety/efficacy 
extension study F13CD-3835 performed in children below 6 years of age. This analysis which covers data 
from 6 patients monthly treated with 35 IU/kg of rFXIII during one year, did not any identify efficacy 
issue in the target population. Indeed, no lacks of efficacy or breakthrough bleedings were reported 
during the observed period. 
Therefore, the results of the clinical development programme provide consistent evidence of the 
haemostatic efficacy of prophylactic treatment with rFXIII in the target population of patients with FXIII 
A-subunit deficiency. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Due to the rarity of FXIII deficiency, experience with NovoThriteen is still relatively limited in the 
paediatric population. Longer-term efficacy data from the extension study F13CD-3835 in children below 
6 years of age, as well as efficacy data from older children (from 6 to 18 years old) through the extension 
study F13CD-3720 will be submitted by the MAH when the F13CD-3835 and F13CD-3720 clinical study 
reports will be finalised in May 2015 and October 2016, respectively. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Important potential risks with the use of rFXIII comprise neutralising antibodies, thromboembolic events 
and allergic reactions (see RMP). No clinical safety signals were identified in these respects, and the 
safety profile of rFXIII supports the use of the drug in the intended target population. The current data do 
not indicate that the observed transient, low-titre, non-neutralising anti-rFXIII antibodies are of clinical 
significance. In the 4 patients and the single healthy subject who developed anti-rFXIII antibodies, these 
were transient, low-titre and non-neutralising antibodies, and no clinical symptoms or changes in Ctrough 
Assessment report  
EMA/71764/2014 
Page 23/26 
  
  
activity levels of FXIII were noted. Furthermore, no thromboembolic events have been reported in trials 
in patients with congenital FXIII deficiency or in healthy subjects. 
The results from the completed paediatric trial (F13CD-3760) provided reassuring safety data also in 
children less than 6 years. 
In addition, raw interim results collected in the ongoing safety/efficacy extension trial F13CD-3835, 
performed on patients from F13CD-3760 PK study, have been presented by the applicant with the cut-off 
date of 15 January 2013. This information which covers data from 6 patients monthly treated with 35 
IU/kg of rFXIII, does not seem to identify safety issues in the age group of children below 6 years of age. 
Indeed, no lack of efficacy, no breakthrough bleedings and no related adverse events were observed 
during this extension study. The related one year interim report was not prepared as study F13CD-3835 
was not described as a clinical measure in the PI.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Based on the PK results from the F13CD-3760 study and the interim efficacy results from the F13CD-
3835 study, initial doubts raised on the potential need of dose adjustment in the paediatric population 
have been addressed for patients below 6 years. 
In order to collect missing data on the management of breakthrough bleedings with rFXIII and investigate 
as much as possible the risk of off-label use in this situation, the MAH planned to collect information 
concerning the efficacy and safety of rFXIII for the treatment of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis 
through the observational PASS study NN1841-3868 (see RMP). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
The results from the completed paediatric trial (F13CD-3760) provided reassuring efficacy and safety data 
in the children aged less than 6 years.  
Based on the provided data, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance in children less than 6 
years of age is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

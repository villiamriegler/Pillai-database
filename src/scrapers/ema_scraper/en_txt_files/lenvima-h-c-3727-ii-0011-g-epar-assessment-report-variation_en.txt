1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II group of variations 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eisai Europe Ltd. submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 24 July 2017 an application for a group of variations.  
The following variations were requested in the group:

Extension of indication to include treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on pivotal Study 
304; consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated and the 
package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC is being updated to add that 
the product can be administered as a suspension in water or apple juice. In addition, the labelling is 
updated to include the unique identifier. An updated RMP version 10 was provided a part of the 
application.  
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Lenvima was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 26 April 2013 in the following indications: 
Treatment of follicular thyroid cancer (EU/3/13/1119) and Treatment of papillary thyroid cancer 
(EU/3/13/1121). 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within a separate orphan designation 
EU/3/15/1460 granted on 19 March 2015. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) will review the designation of Lenvima as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication.  
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/345/2010 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with the authorised 
orphan medicinal product Nexavar. However, as the orphan market exclusivity of Nexavar expired on 
1 November 2017, it was no longer necessary for the CHMP to conclude on possible similarity with 
Nexavar. At the time of adoption of the CHMP opinion, there were no authorised orphan medicinal 
products for the concerned indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Disease or condition 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an invasive carcinoma of the liver. 
Epidemiology 
HCC  is  a  cancer  that  usually  occurs  in  the  setting  of  liver  cirrhosis,  because  of  chronic  infections  with 
hepatitis  B  virus  or  hepatitis  C  virus,  alcohol  consumption,  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis,  or  diabetes 
(EASL&EORTC 2012). 
It is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death, and the global incidence is rising, with approximately 
700,000 cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone (Lozano et al. 2010, Torre et al. 2015). 
In the US, the incidence of HCC is approximately 9.18 per 100,000 persons, in Southern Europe 9.8/3.2, 
in  Western  Europe  7.2/2.1,  and  in  Northern  Europe  3.8/1.6  (male/female,  respectively)  per  100,000 
persons  (Jemal  et  al.  2011).  The  incidence  of  HCC  is  rising  in  the  last  decennia  and  it  varies 
geographically largely due to variations in the incidences of hepatitis B and C infection, with the majority 
of  the  cases  (>  80%)  occurring  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  eastern  Asia.  One  country  alone,  China, 
accounts  for  40%  to  50%  of  worldwide  cases.  Chronic  HBV  infection  is  the  predominant  risk  factor  for 
HCC in Southeast Asia and Africa, whereas chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the risk factor 
for HCC in Western countries and Japan. Unlike the rest of Asia, HCV infection accounts for up to 70% of 
HCCs  in  Japan.  Currently,  there  is  a  rising  HCC  trend  in  the  West,  where  the  incidence  used  to  be  low, 
such as in the United States and Canada; this rise is attributed in part to the HCV epidemic in the 1960s 
and  the  prevalence  of  obesity  and  diabetes  mellitus,  which  are  associated  with  the  metabolic  syndrome 
and  with  nonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease  (NAFLD).  In  Southern  Europe,  HCV  and  alcohol  consumption 
account  for  the  factors  contributing  to  rising  HCC  incidence.  Recent  genomic  studies  have  highlighted 
differences  in  genetic  mutations  and  signatures  among  different  groups  of  patients  who  have  HCC  with 
various etiologies. HCC outcomes also differ between Asian and non-Asian patients because of variations 
in management practices between East and West (Choo et al, 2016). 
Management 
Individual  treatment  decisions  largely  depend  on  the  stage of  disease,  but  not  on its  aetiology.  Surgical 
resection,  transplantation,  and  ablation  are  potential  curative  options  for  early-stage  disease,  whereas 
chemoembolisation is recommended for patients with preserved liver function and disease confined to the 
liver  generally  without  vascular  invasion.  In  most  HCC  patients,  the  disease  is  diagnosed  at  advanced 
stages,  when  curative  treatments,  including  resection,  liver  transplantation,  and  ablation,  are  no  longer 
suitable.  For  patients  who  are  not  or  who  are  no  longer  candidates  for  loco  regional  therapy,  the  oral 
multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only systemic treatment currently approved in the EU. The approval 
was  based  on  the  results  of  a  large  Phase-3  clinical  trial  (Study  100554  SHARP)  conducted  in  602  HCC 
patients  (Llovet  et  al.  2008).  The  study  demonstrated  significantly  increased  survival  under  sorafenib 
(plus  BSC)  compared  to  placebo  (plus  BSC)  (HR  0.69;  p=0.0005),  with  a  median  survival  rate  for  the 
sorafenib  arm  of  10.6  months,  compared  with  7.9  months  for  the  placebo  arm.  Another  trial  (Study 
11849)  similarly  designed  as  SHARP  and  conducted  in  Asian  subjects,  confirmed  the  favourable  SHARP 
results (Cheng et al. 2009). Subgroup analyses from studies conducted with sorafenib have demonstrated 
that  the  survival  benefit  of  sorafenib  is  independent  of  the  underlying  aetiology  of  liver  disease  and 
independent  of  prior  treatments  such  as  TACE  (transarterial  chemoembolization)  which  is  usually 
administered  in  intermediate-stage  HCC.  Other  compounds  (e.g.,  the  anti-PD1  antibody  nivolumab)  are 
currently tested in clinical trials as first line treatment options in comparison with sorafenib.

Currently,  another  oral  multikinase  inhibitor  regorafenib  (Stivarga)  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the 
treatment of adult patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib. 
About the product 
Lenvatinib is  an  oral  multiple  receptor tyrosine  kinase  (RTK)  inhibitor that  selectively inhibits  the  kinase 
activities  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptors  (VEGFRs)  VEGFR1  (FLT1),  VEGFR2  (KDR),  and 
VEGFR3  (FLT4),  in  addition  to  other  proangiogenic  and  oncogenic  pathway-related  RTKs  including 
fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
α (PDGFRα); KIT; and RET.  
It  is  currently  authorised  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  radio-iodine  refractory 
differentiated  thyroid  cancer  (orphan  designation)  and  under  the  name  of  Kisplyx  in  combination  with 
everolimus for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following a prior anti-angiogenic therapy 
(non-orphan designation).  
With this variation application, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) would like to extend the 
indication to the treatment of adult patients with HCC supported by the results of a Phase 3 trial 
(REFLECT). 
Lenvima was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1460 on 19 March 2015 in the following 
indication: “Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)”. Orphan Designation for the treatment of HCC 
was granted on the grounds of prevalence (less than 5 in 10,000 patients) and an assumption of 
significant benefit of lenvatinib over the other medicinal product approved in the EU for treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma at that time (sorafenib).  
CHMP scientific advice on the HCC clinical development programme was received on 15 Nov 2012 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/698149/2012). For the Phase 3 study, the choice of comparator (sorafenib) and 
primary endpoint (overall survival) were endorsed. The CHMP preferred a blinded study to enhance the 
objectivity of the assessment of the secondary endpoints and safety. However, if the study were to be 
conducted open-label, measures should be implemented to ensure symmetric study conduct in both 
treatment arms.    
An addendum to the non-clinical part of the dossier is submitted with this application and the 
Environmental Risk Assessment has been updated based on the expected wider use of Lenvima due to 
the new indication. 
As part of the current grouped variation, to aid administration to patients who have difficulty swallowing, 
it is proposed to introduce alternative instructions to allow the capsule shells to be dissolved first in either 
water or apple juice, to produce a suspension prior to administration. Consequently, changes are 
proposed to Section 4.2 of the SmPC and the relevant section of the PL. 
An RMP (version 10.0 dated 4 July) has been provided which covers the new indication with this variation. 
The adult indication of this extension is covered by a respective paediatric class waiver. Furthermore, the 
MAH has included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal 
products (Nexavar (INN: sorafenib tosylate) in the HCC condition. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
LENVIMA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: 
LENVIMA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1).

The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 8 mg (two 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a 
body weight of < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a body weight of 
≥ 60 kg.  Dose adjustments are based only on toxicities observed and not on body weight changes during 
treatment. The daily dose is to be modified, as needed, according to the dose/toxicity management plan. 
Dose adjustment and Discontinuation 
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation of 
lenvatinib therapy. Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally do not warrant 
interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management.  Details for 
monitoring, dose adjustment and discontinuation are provided in Table 2.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To evaluate the primary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib against HCC, the following additional in 
vitro and in vivo studies were conducted (limited to those not previously submitted in the RCC or DTC 
marketing authorization applications).  
Primary PD, in vitro studies: 
• Crystal structure of FGFR1-lenvatinib complex 
• Inhibition of FGFR signaling in HCC cells 
• Direct antiproliferative effects against HCC cells 
Primary PD, in vivo studies: 
• Antitumour effects in human HCC xenograft models 
• Immunostimulatory effect in an HCC isograft model 
Unless otherwise noted, all doses or concentrations on a weight basis described for lenvatinib in the 
Assessment report

nonclinical studies are expressed in terms of the mesilate salt. 
Four additional pharmacokinetics (PK) studies have been completed, and one study has been reanalysed. 
With the exception of the study conducted to evaluate substrate recognition and inhibition of multidrug 
and toxin extrusion (MATE) by lenvatinib, these studies were conducted to further address questions 
raised during the review of the original marketing application.  
These studies include: 
• Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters of radioactive peaks in monkey plasma 
• Protein binding in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
• Reversibility of covalently bound lenvatinib-related components to human plasma protein 
• Reanalysis of modeling and simulation using Simcyp® 
• Substrate recognition and inhibition of MATE 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies 
• Crystal structure of FGFR1-lenvatinib complex 
In the original Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for radio-iodine refractory DTC, crystal structure 
analysis of VEGFR2-lenvatinib complex revealed that lenvatinib binds to both the ATP-binding site and a 
neighboring allosteric region of VEGFR2 with the DFG motif adopting a “DFG-in” conformation, indicating 
a  novel  binding  mode  termed  type  V,  which  is  distinct  from  that  for  most  other  multikinase  inhibitors 
(type  I  or  type  II)  on  market  (Okamoto,  et  al.,  2015).  A  new  study  was  conducted  to  confirm  whether 
lenvatinib binds to another major target kinase, FGFR1 with the same binding mode. 
The  amino  acid  residues  in  the  FGFR1-lenvatinib  complex  located  in  the  vicinity  of  lenvatinib,  with  a 
maximum distance of 3.9 Å. They are identified as those belonging to the ATP-binding site. The result is 
comparable  to  that  obtained  from  VEGFR2-lenvatinib  complex,  where  the  same  analysis  results  in  13 
residues for ATPbinding site, the Val916 residue for gate-keeper, and 5 residues for neighboring region. 
As shown in0, in both the FGFR1-lenvatinib and VEGFR2-lenvatinib complexes, lenvatinib (colored green 
in the ball-and-stick model) binds to the ATP-binding site (amino acid residues are shown in red letters) 
at  the  common  core  from  the  urea  group  to  the  quinoline  ring,  and  binds  to  the  neighboring  allosteric 
region  (amino  acid  residues  are  shown  in  black  letters)  via  the  cyclopropane  ring,  which  might  have  a 
strong hydrophobic interaction with the phenyl ring of Phe642 (FGFR1) or Phe1047 (VEGFR2). 
These  results  indicated  that  the  binding  mode  of  lenvatinib  to  FGFR1  should  be  type  V  like  the  binding 
mode to VEGFR2, since the binding of lenvatinib to FGFR1 meets the 3 criteria that define a type V kinase 
inhibitor: 1) binds to the ATP-binding site, 2) binds to the neighboring allosteric region, and 3) fits to the 
kinase adopting the DFG-in conformation.

• Inhibition of FGFR signalling in HCC cells 
The inhibitory effects of lenvatinib on the FGFR signal transduction in human HCC cell lines, Hep 3B2.1-7, 
HuH-7, and SNU-449 cells were studied by measuring the phosphorylation of FRS2, which is a pan-FGFR 
specific downstream signalling molecule. The effect of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor clinically used for 
the treatment of HCC, was also evaluated under the same study conditions (see 0). 
Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cells overexpress FGF19 and express its cognate receptor FGFR4. SNU-449 cells 
mainly express FGFR1. 
Lenvatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of FRS2 in HuH-7 and Hep 3B2.1-7 human HCC cells at 
concentrations 0.03 to 3 μmol/L in a concentration-dependent manner and completely inhibited the 
phosphorylation of FRS2 at concentrations ≥1 μmol/L. In contrast, sorafenib showed incomplete inhibition 
of the phosphorylation of FRS2 at concentrations from 0.1 to 3 μmol/L. In SNU-449 cells lenvatinib 
inhibited the phosphorylation of FRS2 in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations from 0.3 to 
3 μmol/L and completely inhibited the phosphorylation of FRS2 at 3 μmol/L. In contrast, sorafenib 
showed incomplete inhibition of the phosphorylation of FRS2 at concentrations from 0.1 to 3 μmol/L.

• Direct antiproliferative effects against HCC cell lines 
This study examined the antiproliferative activity of lenvatinib against 3 human HCC cell lines, Hep 3B2.1-
7, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5 in vitro (see 0). The cell proliferation of Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 is dependent 
on enhanced FGFR signaling involving an autocrine loop of overexpressing FGF19 and FGFR4. Serial

dilutions of lenvatinib mesilate and sorafenib tosylate were added to the cells in culture wells, and the 
cells were cultured for 6 days to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of lenvatinib. As a blank control, the 
vehicle was added to wells without cells. The viable cell number was determined by colorimetric assay 
using WST-8 reagent. Percent inhibition was calculated. As shown in 0, lenvatinib showed stronger 
antiproliferative activity against Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cells compared to PLC/PRF/5 cells. Sorafenib did 
not show remarkable selectivity against either of the cell systems. IC50 values are presented in 0

In vivo studies 
• Antitumour effects in human HCC xenograft models 
The antitumour effect of lenvatinib was evaluated in 5 human HCC xenograft models in athymic mice, and 
compared with the antitumour activity of sorafenib in the same models.

for X days, RBW = relative body weight, SC = subcutaneous, T/C = treatment/control, TGI = tumour growth inhibition, 
TV= tumour volume 
In the Hep 3B2.1-7 human HCC xenograft model, lenvatinib (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) showed dose-
dependent and significant tumour growth inhibition (TGI) compared to the vehicle control with 
treatment/control (T/C) values of 56%, 51%, and 31%, respectively on Day 8. Sorafenib (10 and 30 
mg/kg) also showed dose-dependent and significant TGI with T/C values of 73% and 47%, respectively. 
Body weight loss was similar in vehicle, lenvatinib- and sorafenib-treated groups with relative body 
weights (RBW) of 0.93, 0.87 and 0.89 respectively, at Day 8. 
The antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib and sorafenib was evaluated in the same Hep 3B2.1-7 xenograft 
model. Lenvatinib (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) showed dose-dependent and significant decrease of microvessel 
density (MVD) compared to Vehicle 1 at Day 8 with T/C values of 77%, 62%, and 51%, respectively. 
Assessment report

Sorafenib at 30 mg/kg showed significant decreases of MVD compared to Vehicle 2 with a T/C value of 
72%; however, the effect on MVD at 10 mg/kg was not significant in this model. The good correlation of 
the TGI with the decrease of tumour MVD for lenvatinib suggests that the antiangiogenic activity 
contributes to the antitumour activity of lenvatinib. 
In the PDX-derived LIXC-012 HCC xenograft model, lenvatinib (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) showed dose-
dependent and significant TGI with T/C values of 61%, 43%, and 25%, respectively at Day 11. Sorafenib 
at a dose of 30 mg/kg also showed significant TGI with T/C values of 55% at Day 11; but sorafenib at a 
dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in no TGI. 
BWL was observed in the vehicle control groups due to cachexia, resulting in RBW values at Day 11 of 
0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The BWL in the mid- and high-dose (10 and 30 mg/kg) lenvatinib groups 
was small with RBW values of 0.93 and 0.96 at Day 11, respectively, indicating that the TGI also 
alleviated cachexia-induced BWL. All mice survived in these groups. 
In the HCC PDX model using HuPrime® LI0050 tumour derived from a HCC patient, lenvatinib (10 
and 30 mg/kg) showed significant TGI against the LI0050 xenografts compared to vehicle control on Day 
29 with T/C values of 46% and 33%, respectively. In the group treated with lenvatinib (30 mg/kg), 
dosing to 1/15 mice was suspended from Day 15 to Day 27 due to a transient BWL (the individual RBW = 
0.79) at Day 15. Statistical analysis for TGI in the sorafenib-treated group was not performed since 
dosing was stopped several times during the course of the study and 5/15 mice died by Day 19. 
No remarkable BWL was observed in lenvatinib treated groups (10 and 30 mg/kg) throughout the dosing 
period although 1/15 mice in the lenvatinib (30 mg/kg) group showed transient BWL (the individual RBW 
= 0.79) at Day 15 as described above. Sorafenib (30 mg/kg) was poorly tolerated in this HCC PDX model. 
In another HCC PDX model using HuPrime® LI0334 tumour derived from an HCC patient, lenvatinib 
(10 and 30 mg/kg) showed significant TGI against the LI0334 xenografts compared to vehicle control on 
Day 29 with T/C values of 25% and 14%, respectively. Sorafenib (30 mg/kg) did not show significant TGI 
with a T/C value of 70%.  
No remarkable BWL was observed in the treated mice. 
• Immunostimulatory effect in an HCC isograft model 
This study examined the antitumour effect of lenvatinib as well as the effect of lenvatinib on immune cell 
populations in the BNL 1ME A.7R.1 murine HCC isograft models (See 0).  
As shown in 0, lenvatinib (3, 10 mg/kg) showed significant TGI on Day 8 in the BNL 1ME A.7R.1 murine 
HCC isograft model in immunocompetent mice with T/C values of -31% and –41%, respectively. The 
minus values indicate tumour regression compared with prior treatments (TV on Day 1). TGI for both 
doses of lenvatinib (3, 10 mg/kg) in the immunocompetent mice was significantly greater than those in 
the respective athymic mice. No remarkable BWL was noted in all treated groups.

Figure 3: Antitumour Effects of Lenvatinib in the BNL 1ME A.7R.1 Murine HCC Isografts in Athymic Mice 
and Immunocompetent Mice 
The  effect  of  lenvatinib  on  the  population  of  immune  cells  in  tumours  and  draining  lymph  nodes  was 
evaluated  in  the  same  model.  Flow  cytometric  analysis  of  immune  cells  in  the  immunocompetent  mice 
revealed  that  lenvatinib  (10  mg/kg)  decreased  the  population  of  TAM  (defined  CD45+CD11b+Ly6G–
F4/80+Ly6C low). Lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) also increased activated-cytotoxic T cells in the draining lymph 
node. These results suggested that tumour immunity was enhanced in these tumour bearing mice treated 
with lenvatinib, since TAM acts as a suppressor, and activated-cytotoxic T cells as an effector for tumour 
immunity. 
Therefore, the immune stimulatory effect of lenvatinib in the tumour microenvironment may contribute to 
the greater antitumour activity observed in the immunocompetent mice compared to that in athymic mice 
in this murine HCC isograft model.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.2.3.1.  Metabolism 
2.2.3.1.1.  Analysis of In Vivo Metabolites 
Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters of radioactive peaks in monkey plasma 
Lenvatinib was the main fraction of total radioactivity in plasma after administration of a single 3 mg/kg 
dose  of  either  [14C]lenvatinib  mesilate  (radiolabeled  on  the  quinoline  ring)  (maximum  observed 
concentration  [Cmax]:  89.9%,  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  from  zero  time  extrapolated  to 
infinite  time  [AUC(0-inf)]:  69.7%)  or  [14C]CB-lenvatinib  mesilate  (radiolabeled  on  the  chlorobenzene 
moiety)  (Cmax:  78.4%,  AUC(0-inf):  60.4%)  to  monkeys.  After  administration  of  [14C]lenvatinib 
mesilate, Cmax and AUC(0-inf) of all radioactive metabolite peaks did not individually exceed 1.9% of the 
total radioactivity.  
After dosing of [14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate, mCB9a was the major radioactive metabolite, with Cmax and 
AUC(0-inf)  values  of  12.1%  and  17.0%  of  the  total  radioactivity,  respectively.  With  the  exception  of 
mCB9a,  Cmax  and  AUC(0-inf)  of  all  radioactive  metabolite  peaks  detected  after  dosing  of  [14C]CB-
lenvatinib mesilate did not exceed 4.7% of total radioactivity. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The maximum daily dose of lenvatinib in HCC patients is 12 mg/day to be administered during the entire 
disease period. 
The log octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of lenvatinib is 3.30. 
An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline. The MAH however proposed to estimate 
a more accurate Fpen. Therefore, information based on epidemiological data is provided to support the 
prevalence of HCC for refinement of Fpen. 
The public summary of opinion on ODD – Lenvatinib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(EMA/COMP/132959/2015, 06 May 2015) indicates that at the time of designation, HCC affected 
approximately 0.6 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). From a re-examination of prevalence 
of HCC the prevalence is concluded to have increased slightly over the past years (less than one decimal). 
However, a worst-case prevalence of 1.5 per 10,000 making the extreme assumption that every 
reported case of primary liver cancer was in fact a case of HCC and that liver cancer is underreported by 
45%.

Table 5: Calculation of the Phase I PEC SURFACEWATER of Lenvatinib (for HCC)  
The  PECSURFACEWATER  is  0.00036  μg/L,  or  using  the  worst-case  prevalence  data  0.0009  μg/L.  Both  values 
are lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. Hence, a phase II environmental fate and effects analysis is 
not applicable. 
In addition, The PECSURFACEWATER for RR-DTC and RCC were calculated previously to be 0.00012 μg/L 
and  0.00396  μg/L,  respectively.  The  combined  PECSURFACEWATER  for  lenvatinib  used  in  the  treatment 
of RCC, RR-DTC and HCC patients was 0.0044 μg/L (based on ODD prevalence for HCC) and 0.0050 μg/L 
(based  on  worst-case  prevalence  for  HCC).  This  combined  value  is  lower  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01 
μg/L.  Therefore,  it  is  assumed  that  the  medicinal  product  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the 
environment following its prescribed usage in patients. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Several new in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted to support the 
new proposed indication for Lenvima. 
The new crystal structure analysis indicates that the binding mode of lenvatinib to FGFR1 is also type V, 
similar to the binding mode to VEGFR2. 
The inhibition of FGFR by lenvatinib was further demonstrated in signal transduction assays where 
lenvatinib appeared to be a stronger inhibitor than sorafenib of phosphorylation of FRS2, a FGFR specific 
downstream signalling molecule, in several human HCC cell lines. The difference in potency in these 
assays was 10-fold.  
Lenvatinib showed significant antiproliferative activity against HCC cell lines Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 but 
very weak antiproliferative activity against PLC/PRF/5 cells. Sorafenib did not show remarkable selectivity 
against either of the cell systems. When comparing lenvatinib and sorafenib, the difference in IC50 values 
for antiproliferative activity against the Hep 3B2.1-7 and HuH-7 cell lines was in the order of 10, which 
matches with the results of the FGFR signal transduction assays. 
The weak in vitro antiproliferative activity which has been observed against PLC/PRF/5 cells but 
nevertheless the significant antitumour activity observed in the respective xenograft model suggest that 
the primary antitumour activity of lenvatinib is related to its antiangiogenic activity resulting from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 19/151 
 
  
  
 
inhibition of VEGFR and FGFR, and not to a direct antiproliferative activity against a particular tumour cell 
line. 
The results of 5 new murine HCC xenograft models demonstrated that lenvatinib showed significant 
tumour growth inhibition at doses from 3 or 10 to 30 mg/kg without severe BWL (more or less 10% body 
weight loss compared to the body weight at the initiation of dosing). The activity of lenvatinib was 
generally greater than the activity of sorafenib at the same dose level (factor 1.5 to 2 greater tumour 
volume reduction for lenvatinib compared to sorafenib, depending on the model used). Also the 
tolerability of lenvatinib in terms of BWL was overall slightly better compared to sorafenib in these 
models. 
In a murine HCC isograft model, tumour inhibition by lenvatinib (doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg) was 
significantly greater in immunocompetent mice, compared to athymic mice. In addition, lenvatinib (10 
mg/kg) decreased the population of tumour associated macrophages (TAM) and increased activated-
cytotoxic T cells in the draining lymph node. These results suggest an immune stimulatory effect of 
lenvatinib, since TAM act as a suppressor, and T cells as an effector for tumour immunity. 
A new analysis of previously submitted monkey plasma PK data was submitted but does not impact 
previous conclusions. 
No new clinical toxicology data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
The data submitted to support the DTC and RCC indications was in line with ICH S9. Although a first line 
indication is currently being proposed for HCC, the survival of these patients is short (~1 year) and there 
are no effective therapies available. 
The applicant provided data regarding the prevalence of the disease population targeted by the HCC 
indication and this was used to refine Fpen. The PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L and it is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. 
Therefore lenvatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted as part of this application support the use of lenvatinib in HCC. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of lenvatinib.  
Considering the above data, lenvatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

and efficacy study (Study E7080-G000-304).  
From a non-clinical and clinical perspective, 4 additional pharmacokinetics studies have been completed, 
and 1 study has been re-analysed. These studies include: 
• Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters of radioactive peaks in monkey plasma (see NC) 
• Protein binding in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
• Reversibility of covalently bound lenvatinib-related components to human plasma protein 
• Reanalysis of modeling and simulation using Simcyp® 
• Substrate recognition and inhibition of MATE.

Study  W-20140601  –  formation  of  covalent  binding  of  E7080  with  human  plasma  protein  and  its 
reversibility 
This study investigated the mechanism for the formation of covalent binding of E7080 with human plasma 
protein and its reversibility. E7080-related components which covalently bound to human plasma protein 
were substituted by endogenous nucleophiles such as glutathione (GSH) and cysteine, and their chemical 
structures were analysed. 
This study suggested that E7080 and its metabolite, N-cysteine conjugate of quinolone moiety in E7080, 
could form covalent binding with human plasma protein via thioether and di-sulfide bonds, respectively. 
Nucleophiles such as GSH and cysteine successfully released E7080-related components which covalently 
bound  to  human  plasma  protein  as  the  corresponding  conjugates  via  substitution  reaction,  suggesting 
that  the  covalent  binding  would  be  reversible  in  humans  in  vivo  since  abundant  amounts  of  GSH  and 
cysteine exist. 
Elimination 
No additional data regarding elimination has been submitted with this application. 
Inter- and intra-individual variability  
In the population analysis of study 202, the %CV of apparent total clearance is 32.6 %.  
Table 8: final population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of lenvatinib – Study 202 
In the population analysis of study 304, inter-individual variability (IIV) in the model parameters was 
moderate ranging between 25.4% for CL/F and 93.6% for D1. IIV was well estimated with good precision 
for all the parameters (%RSE ≤ 14.0%). The residual variability in lenvatinib concentrations for TAD ≤ 2 
h was high (%CV 49.0), moderate for cancer patient studies (%CV 36.3), and low for Phase 1 clinical 
pharmacology studies (%CV 17.0).

●Study E7080-J081-202 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated dose  (MTD)  as  defined  by 
the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of lenvatinib administered continuously once a day (QD) as 4 weeks cycle 
in  subjects  with  advanced  HCC  and  hepatic  function  of  Child-Pugh  (CP)  scores  of  5–6  or  7–8  (groups  1 
and 2 respectively). One of the secondary objectives is to determine the PK profiles of lenvatinib.  
In the Dose Escalation Component (Phase 1), PK parameters were determined after single (Cycle 1/Day1) 
and multiple doses (Cycle 1/Day 15), using non-compartmental analysis. The PK profile of lenvatinib was 
evaluated  by  concentration-time  plots.  PK  results  were  summarized  descriptively  by  dose  level  and 
hepatic  function  (Group  1  and  Group  2).  If  possible,  the  relationships  between  pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and efficacy/safety were to be evaluated by plots.  
In  the  Expansion  Component  (Phase  2),  summary  statistics  of  lenvatinib  plasma  concentration  at  each 
time point were calculated. If necessary, pooled data combining this component and the Dose Escalation 
Component  (Phase  1)  and  other  clinical  studies  (eg,  E7080-J081-103)  were  to  be  analyzed  using  the 
population approach.

No relationship between CP score and the PK of lenvatinib was observed in Study 202. This finding is 
similar to results from the hepatic impairment study for lenvatinib, E7080-A001-006. 
Sparse PK sampling was performed for all subjects. A total of up to 6 samples per subject were to be 
obtained pre-dose on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. These data are  
pooled for population PK analysis and are reported in a separate report (see population PK analysis 
below)  
● Study 304 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  initial  Phase  1/2  lenvatinib  trial,  study  304  was  designed  and  conducted  to 
compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  lenvatinib  versus  sorafenib  in  subjects  with  Child-Pugh  class  A, 
unresectable/advanced  HCC.main  criteria  for  inclusion,  adult  subjects  (≥18  years  of  age)  with  a 
histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable HCC, or a clinically confirmed diagnosis 
of HCC according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria, including cirrhosis 
of any etiology, or with chronic hepatitis B or C infection were eligible. In the other key inclusion criteria 
included, child-pugh score A was mentioned. 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from all subjects who took lenvatinib. Exposure parameters such 
as  maximum  concentration  and  area  under  the  concentration  ×  time  curve  (AUC)  were  derived  from 
posterior estimates of the PK parameters from the final population PK model. 
In  general,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  similar  for  subjects  with  a  baseline  CP  score  of  5  or  of  6  in 
lenvatinib  treated  subjects  in  HCC  Study  304.The  incidences  of  severe  (Grade  ≥3)  TEAEs,  SAEs,  and 
TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  were  higher  in  subjects  with  baseline  CP  score  of  6  than  of  5. 
Subjects  with  baseline  CP  score  of  6  compared  with  those  with  baseline  CP  score  of  5  had  a  higher 
incidence of nonfatal SAEs. Subjects with a baseline CP score of 6 also had a  higher incidence of TEAEs 
leading to study drug interruption or to study drug reduction or interruption. 
Overall, the rate of major protocol deviations was low (2.5%; 24 of 954 subjects), and the incidence and 
nature  of  the  protocol  deviations  were  balanced  across  the  treatment  arms.  Most  of  the  major  protocol 
deviations  in  both  the  lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  arms  were  eligibility  criteria  not  met,  mostly  due  to 
laboratory levels outside the acceptable range or Child-Pugh score of 7 or 8 (Class B).

Gender 
The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. 
No significant differences between sexes were found in lenvatinib exposure. 
Race 
The  effect  of  race  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenvatinib  was  evaluated  in  the  population  PK  analysis. 
According to the POP PK analysis, the PK of lenvatinib was unaffected by race. 
In  the  new  study  304,  individual  lenvatinib  oral  clearance  and  AUC  at  steady  state  for  Western,  Asian, 
Chinese and Japanese populations are summarized by starting dose group. The median value and range 
of AUC values are each comparable between the 8 mg group and 12 mg group. There were no differences 
of  lenvatinib  oral  clearance  and  AUC  at  steady  state  among  Western,  Asian,  Chinese  and  Japanese 
populations. 
Weight 
The  effect  of  weight  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenvatinib  was  evaluated  in  the  original  population  PK 
analysis (DTC). In this POP PK analysis, weight (37.8 – 178 kg) added as an allometric constant on CL/F 
and  volume  parameters  showed  a  statistically  significant  effect,  but  only  explained  1.2  %  of  the  inter-
individual variability on CL/F. PK simulations showed a major overlap in the steady-state exposure in the 
presence  and  absence  of  this  covariate.  Subjects  with  body  weight  <60  kg  had  36%  higher  exposure 
compared with subjects >60 kg. 
Study E7080-J081-202 
The (POP) PK analysis for Study 202 (CPMS-E7080-005R-v1) showed that included statistically significant 
and clinically relevant effects of bodyweight on both clearance and volume increased with increasing body 
weight.  Allometric  functions  were  used  to  characterize  these  effects.  As  a  consequence,  fixed  dosing  as 
initially  implemented  in  Study  202  led  to  high  difference  in  exposures  (AUC)  across  the  range  of 
bodyweight.  Observed  data  and  predictions  from  the  final  model  showed  that  compared  with  subjects 
weighing ≥60 kg, subjects with a low body weight ([BW] <60 kg) had a higher lenvatinib area under the 
plasma  concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  and  a  high  rate  of  dose  reductions  and  discontinuations  at  the 
12-mg starting dose. 
In  phase  2  part  of  study  202,  the  dose  reduction  occurred  frequently  and  early  in  the  course  of 
treatment.  Twenty-one  patients  (46.7  %)  of  PK/PD  population  experienced  TEAEs  leading  to  dose 
reduction  or  discontinuation  during  Cycle  1.  The  median  body  weight  of  these  patients  with  early  dose 
withdrawal  or  reduction  was  54.3  kg,  whereas  the  median  body  weight  of  patients  without  early  dose 
modification was 67.6 kg. The final PK model for lenvatinib included body weight effect on oral clearance, 
whereby the relationship between the AUC and body weight shows an increase in AUC as the body weight 
decreases.  The  median  AUC  based  on  the  starting  dose  of  patients  with  early  dose  withdrawal  or 
reduction  was  2950  ng*h/mL,  whereas  the  median  AUC  based  on  the  starting  dose  of  patients  without 
early dose modification was 2050 ng*h/mL (see figure below). 
The  median  steady  state  Cmin  of  patients  with  early  dose  withdrawal  or  reduction  was  46.8  ng/mL, 
whereas the median steady state Cmin of patients without early dose modification was 30.6 ng/mL.

Figure 4: Boxplot of body weight, lenvatinib AUC and Cmin for  patients with vs without TEAEs 
that lead to dose reduction or study drug withdrawal during Cycle 1 
Patients with low body weight experienced the early dose reduction or discontinuation, and this can be 
explained by the higher lenvatinib AUC for patients with low body weight. 
The  MAH  explored  the  cut-off  value  of  lenvatinib  AUC  to  predict  high  risk  group  of  the  early  dose 
reduction or discontinuation. To investigate the best cut-off value of lenvatinib exposure and body weight 
to predict high risk group of the occurrence of TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal or dose reduction 
during Cycle 1, a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used. The classification table cross-
classifies the binary response with prediction of whether the subject experiences TEAEs leading to study 
drug withdrawal/reduction during Cycle 1 or not for some cut-off value based on the final PK/PD logistic 
model. 
ROC curve which was predicted from the developed logistic regression model indicates that the best cut-
off value of lenvatinib AUC is 2430 ng*h/mL with 0.71 sensitivity and 0.71 specificity. 
Based on the final PK model, simulated body weight (range: 40 – 120 kg) vs. lenvatinib AUC curve in 12 
and  8  mg  dose  groups  is  shown  in  figure  below.  Based  on  the  2430  ng*h/mL  of  AUC  as  threshold  to 
predict high risk group of the early dose reduction or discontinuation, the figure suggested that a simple 
body weight adjusted dosing regimen, namely 12 mg dose in subjects whose body weight are 60kg and 
over,  and  8  mg  dose  in  subjects  whose  body  weight  are  less  than  60kg,  was  recommended  to  avoid 
TEAEs leading the early dose reduction or discontinuation. Within the range between 40 kg and 120 kg of 
body  weight,  the  predicted  AUC  of  subjects  whose  body  weight  were  less  than  60kg,  are  calculated 
between  1540  and  2050  ng•h/mL,  and  the  predicted  AUC  of  subjects  whose  body  weight  are  60kg  and 
over,  are  calculated  between  1410  and  2310  ng•h/mL.  The  AUC  range  between  two  dose  groups  was 
similar, which supports the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimens based on a body weight cut-off at 
60kg.Because  of  the  reduced  tolerability  of  the  12-mg  dose  observed  in  subjects  with  low  body  weight 
and the results of PK modelling, a 2-tier dosing strategy based on body weight was proposed for future 
clinical studies with lenvatinib in patients with advanced HCC: 12 mg for subjects weighing ≥60 kg and 8 
mg for subjects weighing <60 kg.

Study E7080-G000-304 and POP PK report CPMS-E7080-011R  
While  bodyweight  effects  on  CL/F  and  V/F  was  fixed  in  model  development  when  data  from  study  304 
were  used.    The  fitting  performances  from  final  PopPK  model  including  data  from  Study  304  confirmed 
that  lenvatinib  PK  was  affected  by  body  weight  in  subjects  with  HCC  (Report  CPMS-E7080-011R).  Both 
CL/F and volume increase with increasing body weight. The lower CL/F in subjects with low body weight 
results in an increase in lenvatinib AUC. Based on individual lenvatinib AUC values for subjects with HCC 
in  Study  304,  however,  the  median  value  and  range  of  individual  AUC  values  at  steady  state  were 
comparable  between  the  8-mg  starting  dose  for  subjects  weighing  <60  kg  and  the  12-mg  dose  for 
subjects  weighing  ≥60  kg.  The  effect  of  changes  in  body  weight  was  more  pronounced  in  HCC  than  in 
previously  studied  tumour  types  (RR-DTC,  RCC).  In  other  tumour  types,  the  effect  of  body  weight  on 
lenvatinib  PK  was  small,  not  clinically  relevant,  and  did  not  warrant  any  dose  adjustment  (CPMS-E7080 
007R; CPMS-E7080-008R). These data confirm the use of the 2-tier dosing strategy based on bodyweight 
in HCC in study 304.

With the exception of Study GE-1399-G, this section is unchanged from the DTC and RCC information.  
Study GE-1399-G 
This study was conducted to assess the potential of E7080 as a substrate or an inhibitor for MATE1 and 
MATE2-K  using  cells  expressing  respective  transporters.  Cells  transfected  with  each  control  vector  were 
used as the control cells. 
The  transports  of  [14C]E7080  by  each  transporter  at  a  concentration  of  1  µmol/L  in  the  presence  and 
absence of each typical inhibitor were assessed. The inhibitory effects of E7080 on each transporter were 
determined at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 µmol/L using radiolabelled typical substrates. 
Assay system, and typical substrates and inhibitors used in this study are summarized below:

In all preparations of transporter-expressing cells and their control cells used in this study, the transport 
activities of typical substrates and inhibitory effects by typical inhibitors were retained normally, indicated 
that the test systems used in this study were adequate to evaluate the potentials of E7080 as a substrate 
and an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Substrate recognition  
Study  GE-1399-G  showed  that  lenvatinib  was  not  a  substrate  of  either  multidrug  and  toxin  extrusion 
(MATE)  1  or  MATE2-K.  No  MATE1-  and  MATE2-K-mediated  transports  of  [14C]E7080  were  detected, 
indicating that E7080 was not a substrate of either MATE1 or MATE2-K.  
-  MATE 1  
In the absence of cimetidine, the uptakes of [14C]E7080 in the MATE1-expressinc cells after incubation for 
1, 2, and 5 minutes were 38.1, 44.1, and 53.8 μL/mg protein, respectively; those in the control cells were 
41.1, 48.8, and 53.2 μL/mg protein, respectively. In the presence of cimetidine (10 μmol/L), the uptakes 
of [14C]E7080 in the MATE1-expressing cells after incubation for 1, 2, and 5 minutes were 36.2, 43.4, and 
46.2 μL/mg protein, respectively; those in the control cells were 39.7, 49.0, and 52.0 μL/mg protein, 
respectively.  
The uptakes of [14C]E7080 in the MATE1-expressing cells after incubation for 1, 2, and 5 minutes were 
comparable to those in the control cells. In addition, cimetidine, a typical MATE1 inhibitor, did not inhibit 
the uptake of [14C]E7080 in the MATE1-expressing cells. These results indicated that E7080 was not a 
substrate of MATE1. 
-  MATE 2 
In the absence of cimetidine, the uptakes of [14C]E7080 in the MATE2-K-expressing cells  after incubation 
for 1, 2, and 5 minutes were 38.8, 41.4, and 50.5 μL/mg protein, respectively; those in the control cells 
were 41.1, 43.1, and 55.9 μL/mg protein, respectively. In the presence of cimetidine (100 μmol/L), the 
uptakes  of  [14C]E7080  in  the  MATE2-K-expressing  cells  after  incubation  for  1,  2,  and  5  minutes  were 
40.4,  43.2,  and  52.2  μL/mg  protein,  respectively;  those  in  the  control  cells  were  40.6,  42.4,  and  55.8 
μL/mg protein, respectively. 
The uptakes of [14C]E7080 in the MATE2-K-expressing cells after incubation for 1, 2, and 5 minutes were 
comparable  to  those  in  the  control  cells.  In  addition,  cimetidine,  a  typical  MATE2-K  inhibitor,  did  not 
inhibit the uptake of [14C]E7080 in the MATE2-K-expressing cells. These results indicated that E7080 was 
not a substrate of MATE2-K.

Inhibitory effect  
Inhibitory  effects  of  E7080  on  MATE1  and  MATE2-K  were  also  assessed  using  the  each  transporter-
expressing  cells  and  their  control  cells.  The  uptake  volumes  of  [14C]metformin  in  MATE1-  or  MATE2-K-
expressing cells in the absence of inhibitors were higher than those in the control cells. In the presence of 
the  typical  inhibitors,  cimetidine  (10  μmol/L  and  100  μmol/L  for  MATE1  and  MATE2-K),  the  uptake 
volumes of [14C]metformin into MATE1- or MATE2-K-expressing cells decreased to 13.1% and 28.1% of 
control, respectively. 
E7080 inhibited MATE1 with the IC50 value of 6.31 μmol/L. For MATE2-K, E7080 showed slight inhibition 
(87.3% or more of control, IC50 > 30 μmol/L).

Study E7080-J081-202 - Phase 1/2 Study of E7080 in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
(HCC) 
Primary  objective:  To  determine  the  MTD  as  defined  by  the  dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  of  lenvatinib 
administered continuously once a day (QD) as 4 week cycles in subjects with advanced HCC and hepatic 
function of CP scores of 5–6 or 7–8. Secondary objectives included evaluating the safety and tolerability 
of  lenvatinib,  determining the  PK  profile  of  lenvatinib  as  well  as  determining  the  recommended dose  for 
future  studies,  evaluating  the  antitumour  efficacy  and  exploring  the  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  markers  of 
lenvatinib. 
Serial blood samples were collected at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after repeated dose on Day 15 of Cycle 
1, and at predose on Days 8 and Days 22 of Cycle 1.  
Lenvatinib was administered on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour after eating. Otherwise, lenvatinib 
was administered under fasting conditions on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 to avoid a possible food effect 
on PK analysis. 
Mean ± standard deviation (SD) plasma concentration-time curves of lenvatinib after first dose (Cycle 1 
Day 1) in Group 1 (Child-Pugh score 5, 6) and Group 2 (Child-Pugh score 7, 8) are presented on a semi-

Summary of the relevant PK information from study 202:  
-  Maximum  plasma  concentration  of  lenvatinib  was  typically  observed  2  hours  after  single  and 
multiple doses. 
- 
- 
In general, exposure, as measured by Cmax, AUC(0-24h), AUC(0-t), Css,max, and AUC(0-τ), for 
lenvatinib appeared to increase with increasing doses. 
Plasma  lenvatinib  concentration  accumulated  after  repeated  dosing  with  a  mean  accumulation 
index  (Rac)  of  AUC(0-24h)  and  Cmax  ranging  from  1.23  to  2.11.The  pharmacokinetics  of 
lenvatinib did not appear to change when evaluated by Child-Pugh score in subjects with HCC. 
Study E7080-G000-304 
In  study  304,  pharmacokinetic  samples  were  collected  from  all  subjects  who  took  lenvatinib.  Exposure 
parameters such as maximum concentration and area under the concentration × time curve (AUC) were 
derived from posterior estimates of the PK parameters from the final population PK model. 
● Subjects with HCC had a 13.2% lower lenvatinib oral clearance than subjects with other cancer types, 
including DTC. 
●  Lenvatinib  PK  parameters  were  affected  by  body  weight  with  both  clearance  and  volume  parameters 
increasing  with  increasing  body  weight.  This  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  lenvatinib  exposure  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018

subjects with low body weight. 
● Lenvatinib exposure was comparable between the 8-mg starting dose group with body weight <60 kg 
and the 12-mg dose group with body weight ≥60 kg. This supports the 8-mg and 12-mg starting doses 
used in the lower and higher weight groups in Study 304. 
● There were no differences in lenvatinib oral clearance or in AUC at steady-state values among Western, 
Asian, Chinese, and Japanese HCC populations in Study 304. 
POP PK modelling 
Two popPK analysis analyses supporting the HCC submission was performed and two different reports 
submitted: POP PK and PK/PD CPMS-E7080-005R-V1 (including data from study 202) and POP PK report 
CPMS-E7080-011R-V1 (including data from study 202 and from study 304).  
Report CPMS-E7080-005R-V1 
The primary objectives of the population PK analysis were: 
-  To  describe  the  PK  profile  of  lenvatinib  in  subjects  with  hepatocellular  carcinoma  and  compare  the  PK 
with other cancer sub-types 
- To identify covariates that explain between subject variability in lenvatinib PK. 
The population PK analysis for lenvatinib was based on pooled data collected from 8 Phase 1 studies in 
healthy subjects (001-008), 4 Phase 1 MTD studies in subjects with solid tumours (101,102, 103 and 
105), and study 202 in subjects with HCC.  
Model-based analyses consisted of a population PK model for lenvatinib. The models was developed in 
NONMEM 7.2. Model building and covariate assessments were conducted using standard methods. 
The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and lenvatinib exposures (AUC 
based on the starting dose and steady state Cmin), which were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets 
to be used in the subsequent PK/PD analyses. 
The PK population for lenvatinib from study 202 consisted of 65 HCC subjects, while the PK population 
from 4 Phase 1 MTD studies (101,102, 103 and 105) consisted of 155 subjects with solid tumours. HCC 
subjects in study 202 had lower body weights and lower liver function values (eg. higher ALP) than 
subjects with other tumour types. 
The PK of lenvatinib was best described by a 3-compartment model with elimination from the central 
compartment.  
The parameter estimates of the final PK model for lenvatinib are presented below:

The objectives of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of lenvatinib monotherapy on pooled 
data from multiple studies, including studies 304 and 202 were:

Identify covariates that explain between-subject variability in lenvatinib PK.Population PK analysis 
of lenvatinib was based on PK data pooled from the 13 studies. Brief descriptions of the studies included 
are presented in the table below:

Table 25: brief description of studies with Pk sampling included in population PK analysis  
Differences in the PK of lenvatinib in subjects with HCC and subjects with other tumour type were tested. 
The final population PK model for lenvatinib was a 3-compartment model with simultaneous first and zero 
order absorption and linear elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, V1/F, 
Q2/F, V2/F, Q3/F, V3/F, Ka, D1 and F1. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was estimated on all parameters 
except Q2/F and Q3/F. A combined additive and proportional error for time after dose (TAD) ≤2 h and 
separate proportional errors for Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies and cancer patient studies was 
used for estimation of residual variability. The final PK model for lenvatinib included body weight effect as 
an allometric constant on both clearance and volume parameters, whereby both parameters increased 
with increasing body weight. Lenvatinib CL/F decreased by 10.2% with albumin levels below 30 g/L and 
decreased by 8.6% with ALP above upper limit of normal (ULN). The HCC population was found to have a

13.2% lower lenvatinib CL/F compared to patients with other cancer types, and a 24.5% lower lenvatinib 
CL/F compared to healthy subjects. Population PK parameter estimates are presented in the table below.

The final PK model for lenvatinib included body-weight effect as an allometric constant on both clearance 
and volume parameters, whereby both parameters increased with increasing body weight. The decrease 
in CL/F in subjects with low body weight results in an increase in lenvatinib AUC. Based on the individual 
lenvatinib AUC at steady state for subjects with HCC in study 304, the median value and range of AUC 
are comparable between the group of starting dose of 8 mg for body weight < 60 kg and 12 mg for body 
weight ≥ 60 kg in study 304, which supports the starting dose of 8 mg for body weight < 60 kg. 
The final PK model for lenvatinib also included covariates related to liver function; CL/F decreased by 
8.6% with ALP > the upper limit of normal, and by 10.2% with albumin levels below 30 g/L. HCC subjects 
had a 13.2% lower lenvatinib CL/F than subjects with other cancer types, including DTC.

No new data regarding mechanism of action has been submitted with this application. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Biomarker analysis 
Exploratory biomarker analyses were performed on blood and tumour tissue samples in the Biomarker 
Analysis Set from Study 304.  
Archival tumour tissue and blood samples were collected pretreatment and at specified time points. The 
BM analysis set (BAS; n = 119) included pts who provided both archival tissue and serum samples. Serum 
samples from 114 pts were analyzed at baseline and over time with ELISA or chemiluminescence for 
VEGF, ANG2, FGF21, FGF23, and PIVKA-II. Gene-expression profiling was performed on tissue samples 
with nCounter® (NanoString). Results from BM analyses were correlated with OS. 
Gene-expression analysis was performed in 58 pts (34 lenvatinib, 24 sorafenib).  
Serum BM and gene expression levels appear to correlate with outcomes in the BAS. The correlation 
analyses for serum biomarkers and gene expression were limited by the small number of samples, as well 
as the observed imbalances between the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the biomarker analysis subset. 
Therefore, no valid conclusion is possible to correlate the results of the biomarker analyses with the 
clinical outcomes of the overall study population as well as between treatment arms at this point. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Report CPMS-E7080-005R-V1  
In addition to the population PK analysis performed (described above) , a PK/PD analysis for safety for 
Study 202 was included in this report. The objectives of this analysis were: 
- 
- 
To  describe  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  longitudinal  platelet  profile  in 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
 To  explore  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  the  occurrence  of  treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to study drug withdrawal or dose reduction for Phase 2 
part of Study 202. 
- 
 To explore the relationship between lenvatinib exposure and occurrence of the following TEAE for 
Phase  2  part  of  Study  202:  Hypertension  (During  Cycle  1),  proteinuria,  palmar-plantar

erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (PPES),  Fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and 
hepatic encephalopathy 
The objectives of the population PK/PD analysis for efficacy for Phase 2 part of Study 202 were: 
- 
To  explore  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  efficacy  endpoints  (objective 
response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), 
progression  free  survival  (PFS)  and  maximum  tumour  shrinkage  in  subjects  with  hepatocellular 
carcinoma  
The objectives of the PK/PD analyses for biomarkers of Study 202 were: 
 Phase 1 part 
- 
To  explore  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  the  change  from  baseline  in  the 
following serum biomarkers: VEGF, SDF-1α, SCF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, total CEP, total CEC, c-kit (-) 
CEP, c-kit (+) CEP, c-kit (-) CEC and c-kit (+) CEP 
Phase 2 part 
- 
To  explore  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  the  change  from  baseline  in  the 
following  serum  biomarkers:  soluble  VEGFR1,  soluble  VEGFR2,  soluble  VEGFR3,  VEGFA,  PGF, 
angiopoietin-2, soluble Tie-2, eotaxin, SDF-1α, G-CSF, IP-10, IL-8, RANTES and soluble CD40L. 
The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and lenvatinib exposures (AUC 
based on the starting dose and steady state Cmin), which were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets 
to be used in the subsequent PK/PD analyses. 
Graphical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between AE and lenvatinib exposure for the 
occurrence  of  CTCAE  grade  ≥2  hypertension  (During  Cycle  1),  proteinuria,  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (PPES),  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea,  CTCAE  grade  ≥1  nausea 
and hepatic encephalopathy. 
The population used for the PK/PD analysis of the platelet count consisted of a total of 65 subjects from 
study  202  only.  The  platelet  count  data  were  best  described  by  an  eight-compartment  PK/PD  lifespan 
model  including  four  PK  compartments  and  four  PD  compartments  parameterized  for  a  zero-order  
production rate constant (Kin), first-order transition rate constant (KT), and slope coefficient of lenvatinib 
plasma  concentration  (SLOP)  where  model  predicted  lenvatinib  concentrations  reduced  the  platelet 
proliferation  rate  or  induced  cell  loss.  The  elimination  rate  constant  (Kdeg)  was  defined  using  baseline 
platelet  count  (BASE)  as  Kdeg  =  Kin/BASE.  Exponential  IIV  was  estimated  for  BASE,  KT  and  SLOP.  The 
results  from  the  covariate  analysis  indicated  that  the  relationship  between  lenvatinib  plasma 
concentration  and  platelet  count  change  in  study  202  was  independent  of  gender,  age,  body  weight, 
hepatic function markers, performance status, factor of carcinogenesis, portal vein involvement, previous 
systemic chemotherapy and surgery history.

In the phase 2 part of study 202, 21 patients (46.7 %) of PK/PD population experienced any treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to dose reduction or discontinuation during Cycle 1. The median 
AUC based on the starting dose of patients with early dose withdrawal or reduction was 2950 ng*h/mL, 
whereas the median AUC based on the starting dose of patients without early dose modification was 2050 
ng*h/mL. The occurrence of TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal or dose reduction during Cycle 1 as a 
function of lenvatinib exposure was modeled with the logit function. The exposure parameters, AUC based 
on  the  starting  dose  and  steady  state  Cmin,  were  tested  for  linear  relationship.  Adding  lenvatinib  AUC 
based on the starting dose as a linear function resulted in higher drop in OFV than that of Cmin. Adding 
lenvatinib  AUC  as  log-linear  and  Emax  functions  resulted  in  the  worse  OFV,  thus  adding  lenvatinib 
exposure as linear AUC was selected as the base model. 
The effects of the following covariates were tested in the univariate analysis, separately both on intercept 
of  experiencing  TEAE  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  or  dose  reduction  as  well  as  for  the  effect  each 
covariate on slope of lenvatinib effect: demographics (sex, body weight and age), liver function markers, 
ECOG  performance  status,  Child-Pugh  score,  factor  of  carcinogenesis  (HBV  or  HCV  vs.  Others),  portal 
vein involvement, previous systemic chemotherapy, prior antihypertensives, and with/without surgery at 
the baseline.  
The model parameters estimated for the final model are represented below. 
Table 27: Final model parameter estimates for the logistic model for occurrence of TEAE leading to study 
drug withdrawal or dose reduction during cycle 1 
The model predicted probability of TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal or dose reduction during Cycle 
1 for HCC patients is shown in the figure below. The observed probability of TEAE leading to study drug 
withdrawal or dose reduction during Cycle 1 for lenvatinib AUC group are also plotted using median AUC

of  each  quantile  AUC  group  (Q1:  1700,  Q2:  2120,  Q3:  2690,  Q4:  3550  ng∙h/mL).  The  probability 
increased with higher AUC. 
Figure 10: Graphical relationship of lenvatinib exposure with time to TEAE leading to study drug 
withdrawal or dose reduction (study 202 Phase 2 part) 
Graphical analysis suggested that lenvatinib exposures are higher in subjects experiencing CTCAE grade 
≥2  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea  and  CTCAE 
grade ≥1 hepatic encephalopathy than those in subjects not experiencing these AEs. 
Clear relationship was seen between the occurrence of TEAEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation 
during Cycle 1 and body weight, whereby patients with low body weight experienced early dose reduction 
or  discontinuation,  and  this  can  be  explained  by  the  higher  lenvatinib  AUC  of  patients  with  low  body 
weight. 
Therefore,  the  exploratory  assessment  for  the  adjustment  of  the  starting  dose  of  lenvatinib  by  body 
weight was performed in further clinical study for HCC. 
ROC curve which was predicted from the developed logistic regression model indicated that the best cut-
off value of lenvatinib AUC is 2430 ng*h/mL with 0.71 sensitivity and 0.71 specificity. 
Within the range between 40 kg and 120 kg of body weight, the predicted AUC of subjects whose body 
weight were less than 60kg, are calculated between 1540 and 2050 ng•h/mL, and the predicted AUC of 
subjects whose body weight are 60kg and over, are calculated between 
No  clear  relationship  between  the  efficacy  endpoints  (TTP,  PFS,  OS,  BOR,  ORR,  DCR  and  maximum 
tumour  shrinkage)  with  lenvatinib  AUC  based  on  starting  dose  could  be  detected.  Thus  use  of  a  lower 
starting dose (8 mg) in patients with body weights less than 60 mg is not expected to impact efficacy. 
Clear trend of ratio change in each of the following serum biomarkers with lenvatinib concentration was 
observed: PGF and VEGFA increased with lenvatinib concentration and angiopoietin-2 and soluble VEGFR2 
decreased with lenvatinib concentration, as shown in the figures below.

Exposure-Response Analysis for Overall Survival and Other Efficacy Variables 
•  After  accounting  for  effects  of  baseline  albumin,  bilirubin,  tumour  size,  Alpha-fetoprotein  (AFP),  Child-
Pugh  score,  macroscopic  portal  vein  invasion,  extrahepatic  spread  or  both,  no  exposure-response 
relationship for OS was observed in the multivariate Cox regression analysis within the exposure range of 
study 304. 
• No exposure-response relationship for PFS and ORR was observed within the exposure range of study 
304. 
• In the absence of a relationship between % change in tumour size and lenvatinib exposure as well as 
the  absence  of  data  following  placebo  in  Eisai-sponsored  studies  to  accurately  estimate  tumour  growth 
rate constant in HCC, or a published value, a PK/PD model for tumour size could not established. 
Exposure-Response Analysis for Adverse Event 
• Lenvatinib AUC at steady state based on the starting dose was a significant predictor for the occurrence 
of  any  grade  of  decreased  appetite.  The  occurrence  of  any  grade  of  decreased  appetite  increased  with 
higher  lenvatinib  AUC.  No  covariates  tested  in  this  analysis  affected  the  exposure-response  relationship 
for the occurrence of decreased appetite. 
•  For  hypertension,  proteinuria,  weight  decreased,  fatigue,  vomiting,  thrombocytopenia,  platelet  count 
decreased,  diarrhoea,  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  and  hepatic  encephalopathy,  no 
significant  relationship  between  lenvatinib  exposure  and  these  AEs  was  detected  within  the  exposure 
range of study 304. 
• Lenvatinib AUC at steady state based on the starting dose was a significant predictor for the occurrence 
of  AEs  leading  to  lenvatinib  dose  reduction  or  interruption.  The  occurrence  of  AEs  leading  to  lenvatinib 
dose reduction or interruption increased with higher lenvatinib AUC. 
• Lower baseline AFP level was a significant predictor for the occurrence of AEs leading to lenvatinib dose 
reduction  or  interruption.  Lower  baseline  AFP  level  was  also  associated  with  longer  treatment  duration 
confounding any interpretation of AFP levels and dose reductions or interruptions. 
•  For  AEs  leading  to  lenvatinib  treatment  withdrawal,  no  significant  relationship  between  lenvatinib 
exposure and these AEs was detected within the exposure range of study 304. 
Exposure-Response Analysis for Blood Pressure 
• Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) data were best described by an indirect response model with 
lenvatinib AUC at BP assessment affecting input rate constant for BP resulting in increased BP. 
• No covariates tested in this analysis affected the exposure-response relationship for blood pressure.  
• The model predicted increase in BP was small and not considered clinically important in the therapeutic 
exposure range for subjects with HCC. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Data from 21 studies were used to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenvatinib. These included a 
Phase 1/2 dose finding study for subjects with HCC (Study E7080-J081-202) and an HCC Phase 3 safety 
and efficacy study (Study  E7080-G000-304). The understanding of the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib is 
broadened by the secondary objectives defined in the clinical studies 202 and 304, especially by means of 
the accompanying POP PK analysis provided.  
From study 304, it was observed that subjects with HCC had a 13.2% lower lenvatinib oral clearance than 
subjects with other cancer types, including DTC. Lenvatinib PK parameters were affected by body weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 46/151 
 
  
  
with both clearance and volume parameters increasing with increasing body weight. This was associated 
with  an  increase  in  lenvatinib  exposure  in  subjects  with  low  body  weight.  Lenvatinib  exposure  was 
comparable between the 8-mg starting dose group with body weight <60 kg and the 12-mg dose group 
with  body  weight  ≥60  kg.  The  8-mg  and  12-mg  starting  doses  used  in  the  lower  and  higher  weight 
groups in Study 304 are supported from a PK perspective. 
In  HCC  studies  202  and  304,  subjects  with  Child-Pugh  class  A  and  B  were  included.  In  study  202,  no 
relationship  between  CP  score  and  the  PK  of  lenvatinib  was  observed  and  the  exposure  is  significantly 
decreased in moderate impaired patients with 8 mg QD compared to the exposure of mild and moderate 
impaired  patients  with  12  mg  QD.  In  study  304,  no  PK  analysis  has  been  made  with  the  subjects  with 
child-Pugh B (score 7 or 8) since the enrolment of these subject was in fact a protocol deviation (n=3).  
Patients  ≥75 years,  of  white  race  or  female  sex  or  those  with  worse  baseline  hepatic  impairment 
(Child-Pugh A score of 6 compared to score of 5) appear to have reduced tolerability to lenvatinib.  
The available data are insufficient to allow for a dosing recommendation for HCC patients with moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  B).  Lenvatinib  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
imparement (Child-Pugh C) and is not recommended for use in these patients. 
From  a  non-clinical/clinical  perspective,  the  4  additional  pharmacokinetics  studies  that  have  been 
completed (peaks in monkey plasma, protein binding in HLMs, reversibility of covalently bound lenvatinib-
related components and MATE inhibition and substrate) are adequately performed and address questions 
raised during the review of the original marketing application. Lenvatinib is not a substrate for MATE1 and 
MATE2-K and showed minimal or no inhibitory effect on MATE2-K and weakly inhibits MATE1.  
In  addition  to  the  population  PK  (PopPK)  and  PK/PD  analyses  performed  for  the  original  lenvatinib 
submissions  (reported  in  CPMS-E7080-007R)  and  the  population  PK  and  PK/PD  analyses  performed  for 
the  RCC  submission  (reported  in  CPMS-E7080-  008R),  an  analysis  supporting  the  HCC  submission  was 
performed.  
No dose adjustments are required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment.  The available data do not allow for a dosing recommendation for patients with HCC and 
severe renal impairment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The level of lenvatinib protein binding is yet not considered to be known while the assessment of severe 
renal and hepatic impairment should be based on free fraction. To reply to this question, study 010 
entitled "A Multicenter Phase 0 Study In Healthy Subjects As Well As Subjects With Either Hepatic Or 
Renal Impairment To Obtain Plasma To Assess In Vitro Lenvatinib Protein Binding" will be submitted 
according to the timeline and is included in the RMP. Study 109 entitled “drug-drug interaction to 
investigate the potential of lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction” is included in the RMP and should 
be submitted according to the timelines. 
Based on the results of study E7080-A001-009, the lenvatinib capsules may be added without breaking or 
crushing them to a tablespoon of water or apple juice in a small glass to produce a suspension.  The 
capsules must be left in the liquid for at least 10 minutes and stirred for at least 3 minutes to dissolve the 
capsule shells.  The suspension is to be swallowed.  After drinking, the same amount of water or apple 
juice (one tablespoon) must be added to the glass and swirled a few times.  The additional liquid must be 
swallowed (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenvatinib  is  appropriately  described.  No  major  issues  have  been 
identified. However, for the time being, it is not clearly demonstrated that the exposure in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment is sufficiently high with a starting dose of 8 mg, especially for patients with 
> 60 kg. The SmPc should be adapted accordingly.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Initial evidence for the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in HCC was obtained from Study E7080-J081-202 
(hereafter  referred  as  Study  202),  which  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  Phase  1/2  study  of  lenvatinib 
consisting of a Dose Escalation Component (Phase 1) and an Expansion Component (Phase 2) in subjects 
with advanced HCC for whom standard therapy or other appropriate therapy was not available. This study 
was conducted with tablet formulation of lenvatinib. 
The  primary  basis  for  establishing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lenvatinib  in  HCC  is  the  Phase  3  Study 
E7080-G000-304  (hereafter  referred  as  Study  304),  a  randomized,  controlled,  open-label,  multi-center, 
non-inferiority trial versus sorafenib. This study was conducted with an  approved capsule formulation of 
lenvatinib. 
A tabular listing of the lenvatinib studies contributing efficacy data in HCC is provided in table below.

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study E7080-J081-202: A Phase 1/2 Study of E7080 in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (HCC) 
This study was a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2, dose-finding study of lenvatinib that evaluated the 
safety, activity, and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic relationships of lenvatinib in subjects with 
advanced HCC for whom standard therapy or other appropriate therapy was not available. Lenvatinib was 
given as tablet formulation once daily (QD) for 4 weeks per cycle with no break. The study was conducted 
in Japan and Korea. The first patient enrolled 24 July 2009 and the data cut-off date for the primary 
analysis was 15 June 2014. The study completed 13 August 2015. The data cut-off for the interim 
analysis occurred on 23 Dec 2011 when all subjects completed at least 6 months of study therapy or 
discontinued study treatment.   
Study 202 consisted of (1) a Dose-escalation component (Phase 1) designed to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of lenvatinib in HCC based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify a dose for Phase 2 
of the study, and (2) an Expansion component (Phase 2) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
lenvatinib at the recommended Phase 2 dose (12 mg QD). 
Figure 11: Study design of Phase1/2 study 202 
In  the  dose-escalation  component  (Phase1),  lenvatinib  doses  of  12  mg  (6  subjects)  and  16  mg  (3 
subjects) QD were tested in subjects with advanced HCC and hepatic function of Child-Pugh (CP) scores 
of  5–6  (Group 1)  and  lenvatinib  dose  of  8  mg  (6  subjects)  and  12  mg  (5  subjects)  QD in  subjects  with 
advanced  HCC  and  hepatic  function  of  Child-Pugh  (CP)  scores  of  7–8  (Group  2).  The  dose-escalation 
component  was  designed  primarily  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  based  on  DLT.  The  MTD 
was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients had a DLT. The Enrolled Analysis 
Set comprised 20 subjects (9 in Group 1 and 11 in Group 2) that received study treatment and completed 
the  study  (i.e.  experienced  DLT  or  completed  tolerability  assessment  without  DLT  until  Day  28  of  Cycle 
1).  
In Group 1 (CP scores of 5–6), 1 DLT (fever and vomiting, resulting in less than 75% of the prescribed 
number of doses) was observed in the 6 subjects dosed at 12-mg QD and 2 DLTs (liver dysfunction and 
hepatic encephalopathy; proteinuria) were observed in the 3 subjects dosed at 16-mg QD, establishing 
12 mg QD as the MTD for Group 1.  
In Group 2 (CP scores of 7–8), 2 DLTs (hepatic encephalopathy; AST increased, hyperbilirubinaemia, 
creatinine increased resulting in less than 75% of the prescribed number of doses) were observed in the 
5 subjects dosed at 12-mg QD and no DLT was observed in 6 subjects dosed at 8-mg QD, establishing 8 
mg QD as the MTD for Group 2. 
The 12-mg QD dose, determined to be the MTD in subjects with a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6 (Class A 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 49/151 
 
  
  
 
[CP-A]), was the recommended dose for the Phase 2 portion of the study. 
Tumour assessments were performed using RECIST 1.1. Based on investigator assessment, the ORR was 
15.0% (95% CI: 3.2, 37.9) and the DCR was 65.0% (95% CI: 40.8, 84.6). Three subjects (15.0%) had a 
BOR of PR, and 10 subjects (50.0%) had a BOR of SD, while 6 subjects (30.0%) had PD. One subject was 
declared NE. No subject had a BOR of CR. Median TTP was 3.60 months (95% CI: 1.90, 7.50). 
However,  approximately  74%  of  subjects  with  HCC  treated  with  lenvatinib  12  mg  QD  required  dose 
reduction  to  8  mg.  A  PopPK  analysis  including  Study  202  showed  that  both  clearance  and  volume 
increased  with  increasing  body  weight  (please  refer  to  the  PK  section).  Consequently,  lenvatinib  AUC 
increased as body weight decreased in subjects with HCC. Subjects with a low body weight (<60 kg) had 
a  higher  lenvatinib  AUC,  which  appears  to  have  led  to  the  high  rate  of  dose  reductions  and 
discontinuations in these subjects in Cycle 1 in Study 202. 
Based on these results, a 2-tier dosing strategy based on body weight was proposed in future HCC trials 
both to achieve comparable lenvatinib exposures and to manage toxicity: 12 mg QD for subjects weighing 
60 kg and over, and 8 mg QD for subjects weighing less than 60 kg. This 2-tier dosing strategy was used 
in HCC Study 304. The final PopPK model including data from Study 304 confirmed that lenvatinib PK was 
affected by body weight in subjects with HCC (Report CPMS-E7080-011R). The effect of changes in body 
weight  was  more  pronounced  in  HCC  than  in  previously  studied  tumour  types  (RR-DTC,  RCC).  In  other 
tumour  types,  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  lenvatinib  PK  was  small,  not  clinically  relevant,  and  did  not 
warrant any dose adjustment (CPMS-E7080-007R; CPMS-E7080-008R). These data supported the use of 
the 2-tier dosing strategy based on body weight in HCC. (see relevant clinical pharmacology sections)

Study E7080-G000-304: A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Trial to Compare the 
Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib (E7080) Versus Sorafenib in First-Line Treatment of Subjects 
With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Methods 
Study E7080-G000-304 (Study 304) was a multi-center, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority Phase 3 
study of lenvatinib versus sorafenib. 
The study consisted of 3 phases, the Pre-randomization, the Randomization, and the Extension Phase. 
The Pre-randomization phase comprised 2 periods, Screening and Baseline. The Randomization and the 
Extension phases each comprised 2 periods, the Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. 
The Randomization Phase of the study ended at the date of data cut-off for the primary analysis of OS 
(13 Nov 2016), which occurred when the target number of events (700 deaths) among the 2 treatment 
groups was observed. All subjects who were still on study treatment or in follow-up at that time entered 
the Extension Phase. Ongoing subjects continued to be followed for survival and all subsequent anticancer 
treatments received were recorded.

Treatments 
Lenvatinib capsules were taken orally, QD in continuous 28-day cycles. The lenvatinib dose was based on 
the subject’s baseline body weight (BW): 
• 
• 
Lenvatinib 12 mg QD for subjects with baseline BW ≥60 kg 
Lenvatinib 8 mg QD for subjects with baseline BW <60 kg 
Capsules were taken in a fasting state or after a meal.  
No dose adjustments were required on the basis of hepatic function in those patients who had mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). 
Sorafenib tablets were taken orally at the approved dose for HCC (400 mg BID, Nexavar SmPC).  
Table 29: Treatments administered  
Sorafenib was selected as comparator as this is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced HCC in 
the first-line setting and is regarded as standard of care.  
Toxicity  for  both  treatment  arms  was  managed  by  a  combination  of  treatment  interruption,  dose 
reduction,  or  treatment  discontinuation.  Dose  modifications  for  sorafenib  related  toxicity  followed  the 
approved prescribing information for each country/region.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
•  Overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any 
cause. Subjects who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the subject was known 
to be alive, and subjects who remained alive were censored at the time of data cut-off. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first 
documentation  of  disease  progression,  or  the  date  of  death,  whichever  occurred  first. 
Progression-free  survival  censoring  rules  were  defined  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  and 
followed United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) guidance. 
Time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first  documentation  of  disease  progression.  Time  to  progression  censoring  rules  were  defined  in 
the SAP. 
•  Objective  response  rate,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  a  best  overall  response 
(BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). 
•  HRQoL assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, the HCC-specific questionnaire (HCC-18), and a generic 
instrument EQ-5D-3L. 
• 
Plasma PK lenvatinib exposure parameters. 
Exploratory endpoints 
•  Disease  control  rate,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  BOR  of  CR  or  PR,  or  stable 
disease  (SD).  Best  overall  response  of  SD  must  have  occurred  at  least  7  weeks  after 
randomization  (within  a  1-week  window  of  the  protocol-specified  8-week  time  point  for  the  first 
post-baseline tumour scan). 
• 
• 
 Clinical benefit rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who had a BOR of CR or PR or durable 
SD (duration of SD ≥23 weeks after randomization). 
Exploratory  biomarker  analysis,  defined  as  baseline  and/or  change  from  Baseline  of  exploratory 
soluble,  tissue  and/or  genetic  biomarkers  and  their  correlations  with  clinical  outcomes  were 
assessed. Correlative data will be presented in a separate Biomarker Analysis Report. 
Assessments 
Tumour  assessments  were  performed  every  8  weeks  from  the  date  of  randomization,  or  as  clinically 
indicated,  until  disease  progression.  Subjects  discontinued  study  treatment  at  the  time  of  objectively 
documented disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request or withdrawal of 
consent. Subjects were followed every 12 weeks for survival.  
Time-to-event  efficacy  endpoints  were  based  on  investigator  assessment  of  tumour  response  as 
determined using the mRECIST for hepatic lesions and RECIST v1.1 for non-hepatic lesions.   
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 54/151 
 
  
  
Investigators  were  trained  in  the  application  of  mRECIST  and  early  feedback  on  quality  of  tumour 
assessment was provided to sites by an independent mRECIST expert. All tumour assessment scans were 
sent to PAREXEL for quality assessment and archiving. A blinded, retrospective IIR of tumour assessment 
scans was performed by experienced radiologists using both mRECIST and RECIST 1.1. 
Sample size 
Sample  size  determination  was  based  primarily  on  the  required  number  of  target  events  to  detect  the 
noninferiority and superiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib in the comparison of the OS. The required number 
of target events was estimated based on the following assumptions: 
• 
Exponential  distribution  was  assumed  for  OS.  The  estimated  median  OS  of  sorafenib  is 
approximately  10  months,  and  an  improvement  of  2.5  months  was  derived  from  the  underlying 
objective of achieving a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.8, which would be of marked clinical benefit. 
•  Using a noninferiority test by the 95% confidence interval (CI) lower limit method on log HR for 
OS  with  assumed  true  HR  of  0.80  and  noninferiority  margin  of  1.08  (corresponding  to  60% 
retention of sorafenib effect versus placebo), the power of the study to declare noninferiority was 
approximately 97%. 
• 
The  power  of  the  study  to  declare  superiority  of  lenvatinib  to  sorafenib  was  approximately  82% 
using the superiority test with assumed true HR of 0.80. The overall false positive rate was set at 
2-sided 0.05. 
Based on these assumptions, the required number of events was estimated to be approximately 666 
events (deaths) based on PPS. Assuming approximately 5% of subjects with major protocol deviations 
would be excluded from PPS, approximately 700 events (deaths) based on the FAS would be required at 
the time of primary analysis. Two interim analyses for futility (1 at approximately 30%, and a second at 
approximately 70% of the target number of events) were taken into account for the estimation. It was 
estimated that approximately 940 subjects were to be randomized to observe this number of events, 
which for a randomization ratio of 1:1 is a minimum of 470 per treatment group. 
Randomisation 
After the Baseline period, subjects were randomised 1:1 to lenvatinib (12mg if baseline BW ≥60kg or 
8mg if baseline BW <60kg) QD oral dosing or sorafenib 400mg BID oral dosing. Allocation of 
randomization numbers was performed using an interactive voice/web response system (IxRS®) based 
on the following stratification factors: 
•  Region: Region 1 (Asia-Pacific); Region 2 (Western - EU, North America, other) 
•  Macroscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI) or extrahepatic spread or both: Yes; No 
• 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS): PS = 0; PS = 1 
•  BW: <60 kg; ≥60 kg

Definition of Analysis Sets 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 55/151 
 
  
  
Full Analysis Set (Intent to Treat Analysis Set) included all subjects who were randomized. This was the 
primary  analysis  set  for  all  efficacy  evaluations.  Subjects  were  analysed  according  to  their  randomized 
treatment group. 
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) included subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
the  assigned  study  drug  and  had  no  major  protocol  deviations.  Criteria  for  exclusion  from  the  PPS 
analysis set were determined before the data lock for the primary analysis of OS. This was the secondary 
analysis set for all efficacy evaluations. 
Safety  Analysis  Set  included  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the  study  treatment.  Subjects 
who  received  any  dose  of  lenvatinib  during  the  treatment  period  were  grouped  into  the  lenvatinib 
treatment group. Subjects who received sorafenib only during the treatment period were grouped into the 
sorafenib treatment group. This was the analysis set for all safety evaluations. 
Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  Set  included  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  lenvatinib,  had 
evaluable dose data, and had at least 1 quantifiable lenvatinib concentration. 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set included subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had 
evaluable PD data. 
Statistical Methodology 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint for this study was overall survival (OS).  
A non-inferiority test of OS between lenvatinib and sorafenib was performed based on the FAS as the 
primary analysis set and the PPS as the secondary analysis set. Noninferiority of OS between lenvatinib 
and sorafenib was tested using a 2-sided 95% CI of HR (lenvatinib: sorafenib) estimated using a Cox 
proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, stratified by the randomization (IxRS) 
stratification factors (region, presence or absence MPVI or extrahepatic spread or both, ECOG PS, and 
BW). Noninferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final 
analysis.The non-inferiority margin of 1.08 was calculated based on the sorafenib SHARP trial and Asia-
Pacific trial data. Using the 95% CI lower limit method on log HR as described in Rothmann etal. (2003), 
the non-inferiority margin corresponding to lenvatinib preserving at least 60% of sorafenib effect versus 
placebo was calculated as 1.08. If at the final analysis the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the HR 
(lenvatinib/sorafenib) was less than 1.08, non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib would be inferred and 
>60% retention of sorafenib treatment effect by lenvatinib would be demonstrated. Using a margin of 
1.08 and an assumed true HR of 0.8, the power of the study to declare NI was approximately 97%.  
If noninferiority was declared for OS, then superiority (corresponding to δ = 1) was to be tested for OS 
using a stratified log-rank test with the randomization (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority would be 
declared if the 2-sided P value was <0.05 using the stratified log-rank test at the final analysis. No 
multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the noninferiority and superiority of OS due to the 
closed testing principle. 
In the SAP, all primary efficacy analyses were changed to be based on randomisation stratification factors 
per IxRS rather than per the CRF data (as stated in the protocol). The analysis with stratification factors 
based on CRF data were used for sensitivity analyses. Other sensitivity analyses were an unstratified log 
rank test and an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
The median OS and the cumulative probability of OS at selected time points were calculated for each 
treatment group and presented with 2-sided 95% CIs. The selected time points depended on the OS 
times that were observed during the study and were specified in the SAP. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS 
for each treatment group were plotted over time.

Secondary efficacy analyses 
For  the  secondary  endpoints,  PFS,  TTP,  ORR  using  mRECIST  and  impact  on  health-related  Qol,  the 
objective was to show superiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib. 
The  fixed  sequence  procedure  was  used  to  control  the  overall  type  I  error  rate  of  analyses  for  the 
secondary endpoints at α = 0.05 (2-sided) after the non-inferiority for primary efficacy endpoint, OS, was 
declared.  The  order  of  testing  for  secondary  endpoints  followed  the  order:  PFS,  TTP,  ORR,  and  health-
realted QoL. In the ordered sequence, each secondary endpoint was tested at the 5% level until the first 
nonsignificant outcome occurred. If a nonsignificant outcome occurred, then the results of the inferential 
analyses of the subsequent endpoints were presented for descriptive purposes only. 
PFS: The test for a difference in PFS between lenvatinib and sorafenib was performed using a stratified 
log-rank test stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The corresponding estimate of HR was 
calculated from the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor and stratified by the 
randomization  stratification  factors.  Median  PFS  and  the  cumulative  probability  of  PFS  at  selected  time 
points was calculated for each treatment group, and presented with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs. The 
selected time points depended on the PFS times that were observed during the study and were specified 
in the SAP. Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS for each treatment group were plotted over time. 
TTP: The difference in TTP between lenvatinib and sorafenib was evaluated using the same procedure as 
used for PFS, with the exception that death was censored. 
ORR:  Objective  response  rate  was  estimated  by  treatment  group.  The  statistical  significance  of  the 
difference  in  ORR  between  treatment  groups  was  evaluated  using  the  Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel  chi-
square test with the stratification factors as strata, tested at an alpha level of 0.05 (2-sided). The 2-sided 
95% CIs for the odds ratio and the difference in ORR were calculated as well as 2-sided 95% CIs for the 
rate within treatment group. 
HRQoL:  For  HRQoL,  a  simple,  comparative,  cross-sectional  analysis  was  performed  for  each  available 
PRO variable using the cross-sectional population (CSP). The EORTC QLQ-HCC18 and QLQ-C30 domains 
were  tested  hierarchically,  guided  by  their  relative  importance  to  the  condition  being  studied,  with  all 
EORTC  QLQ-HCC18  domains  tested  prior  to  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  domains.  To  estimate  the  effect  of 
treatment assignment on change in domain scores from Baseline, mixed models were constructed among 
patients  included  in  the  longitudinal  period  population  (LPP)-based  on  the  Full  Analysis  Set.  Sensitivity 
analyses  were  conducted  on  the  LPP-based  on  the  per  protocol  analysis  set.  If  the  sample  size  of  LPP 
permitted,  longitudinal  modelling  of  the  EQ-5D  Health  Utility  Index  (HUI),  EQ-5D  Visual  Analogue  Scale 
(VAS),  EORTC  QLQ-C30  summary  scores,  and  the  QoL/global  health  status  were  conducted  to  estimate 
the  effect  of  treatment  assignment  (lenvatinib  versus  sorafenib)  on  change  from  Baseline.  A  two-sided 
test with p-value ≤ 0.05 (unadjusted for multiplicity) was considered statistically significant. 
Interim analyses 
Two interim analyses were planned with early stopping rules for futility based on non-inferiority. The first 
interim  analysis  was  planned  for  when  ~210  deaths  (30%  of  the  target)  were  observed,  estimated 
around 16 months. The second interim analysis was planned for when ~ 490 deaths (70% of the target) 
were observed, estimated around 26 months.

Data cutoff date: 13 Nov 2016. 
a: Other reasons for screening failure varied, with the most common reasons being expiration of the 21-day screening 
window (n=4) and worsening of the subject’s condition (n=3). 
b: Two subjects randomized to lenvatinib were not treated as they were randomized in error, and 1 subject 
randomized to sorafenib chose not to receive treatment; therefore the Safety Analysis Set includes 476 subjects in the 
lenvatinib arm and 475 subjects in the sorafenib arm. 
c: “Other” reasons for discontinuation in the lenvatinib arm included randomization in error (n=2; not treated); subject 
required surgery (n=2) and investigator choice (n=1). In the sorafenib arm, “other” reasons included investigator 
choice (n=5); need for a prohibited medication (warfarin; 1 subject); and discontinuation to undergo liver 
transplantation (n=1).

a: On study refers to subjects who were still receiving study drug or who were in survival follow-up as of the cut-off 
date. 
b: Off study refers to subjects who were no longer being followed for survival as of the cut-off date. 
As of the 13 Nov 2016 data cut-off, median duration of treatment was 5.7 months in the lenvatinib arm 
and 3.7 months in the sorafenib arm.  
Recruitment 
Enrolment in Study 304 occurred between 01 March 2013 (first subject gave informed consent) and 30 
July 2015 (last subject enrolled) . A total of 954 subjects were enrolled and assigned to treatment at 183 
study sites (number of sites initiated) in Asia, North America, the European Union, Russia, and Israel. Per 
protocol, the planned number of subjects enrolled in China was limited to 200; in actuality, 213 subjects 
were randomly assigned to study treatment in China. 
Conduct of the study 
The data cut-off date for the primary analysis of OS was 13 November 2016, which occurred when the 
target number of events (700 deaths) was observed across the 2 treatment arms. All subjects who were 
still receiving study drug or who were in follow-up as of the cut-off date entered the Extension Phase of 
the study, whereby subjects continued to receive study drug at their assigned dose. Ongoing subjects 
continued to be followed for survival and all subsequent anticancer treatments received were recorded. 
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
An independent DMC conducted 2 unblinded interim analyses. The interim analyses were performed by an 
independent  statistical  team  and  the  study  team  was  not  given  access  to  the  summary  of  aggregated 
data by treatment group. Early stopping boundaries for futility at the interim analyses and success criteria 
at the final analyses are shown in Table below.

The first interim analysis was performed when 249 deaths were reported, and the efficacy and key safety 
results were reviewed by the DMC on 13 May 2015. The second interim analysis was performed when 521 
deaths were reported, and the results were reviewed on 3 Feb 2016. Both times, the DMC recommended 
continuation of the trial with no modifications.  
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (v1.0) was approved on 16 Nov 2012. Three protocol amendments were made 
throughout the period covered by this study report.

A change to the planned  analysed in the  SAP before treatment unblinding was that all efficacy  analyses 
had  to  be  based  on  randomization  factors  per  IxRS  rather  than  per  the  CRF  data  (as  stated  in  the 
protocol). The randomization factors based on CRF data were used for sensitivity analyses. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, the rate of major protocol deviations was low (2.5%; 24 of 954 subjects; lenvatinib - 11 [2.3%] 
subjects; sorafenib- 13 [2.7%] subjects), and the incidence and nature of the protocol deviations were 
balanced across the treatment arms. (table below) 
Most of the major protocol deviations in both the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms were eligibility criteria not 
met, mostly due to laboratory levels outside the acceptable range or Child-Pugh score of 7 or 8 (Class B). 
Fifteen subjects, 8 (1.7%) in the lenvatinib and 7 (1.5%) in the sorafenib arm, were enrolled and did not 
meet eligibility criteria and 4 subjects, 2 (0.4%) in each arm, had a prohibited procedure. These 
prohibited procedures were: 
Lenvatinib: TACE on Study Day 253 then discontinued study treatment 1 month later (subject 24151008) 
and radiotherapy of 1 target and 3 non-target lymph nodes on C1D1 plus baseline Child-Pugh of 8 [Class 
B], (subject 30031005). 
Sorafenib: radiotherapy of lymph node target lesion on C1D7 (subject 30051009) and on C2D1 (subject 
30051014). 
One subject (14061009) in the lenvatinib arm took an overdose of study medication (single 120-mg dose 
on Study Day 1 rather than the assigned 12 mg).

a: 8 mg and 12 mg were the lenvatinib starting doses based on body weight (<60 kg, ≥60 kg) at Baseline. 
b: Western region consists of North America and Europe including Russia and Israel; Asia-Pacific region 
consists of China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
c: The proportion of subjects with underlying cirrhosis at Baseline was likely underestimated, as this 
information was collected on the CRF under medical history, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis was verified only if needed to 
confirm the clinical diagnosis of HCC.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in FAS within the relevant treatment group. 
Prior therapy 
Prior medication 
Overall, 86.2% of lenvatinib subjects and 87.4% of sorafenib subjects received at least 1 prior medication 
(excluding  anticancer  therapies).  The  type  and  frequency  of  prior  medications  in  the  2  treatment  arms 
were comparable. 
Table 36 : Antiviral therapy 
Prior anticancer therapy 
Since  Study  304  was  designed  to  evaluate  lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  as  first-line  systemic  treatment  of 
subjects  with  advanced/unresectable  HCC,  prior  anticancer  therapy  for  this  disease  was  not  allowed, 
with  two  exceptions.  Prior  anticancer  therapy  was  allowed  only  if  given  in  the  adjuvant  setting  or  if 
administered locally, concurrently with a liver-directed procedure. 
Three subjects in the lenvatinib arm received a prior anticancer medication; 2 as adjuvant HCC treatment 
(human telomerase reverse transcriptase peptide vaccine, approximately 30 months prior to 
randomization, and combination chemotherapy, approximately 3.5 years prior to randomization).  The 
third subject received thalidomide for advanced HCC approximately 1.5 months prior to randomization; 
this was considered a major protocol deviation.  
In the sorafenib arm, 2 subjects received adjuvant anticancer medication (an investigational drug, PI-88, 
sulfonated monophosphorylated mannose oligosaccharides) 3.9 months and 2.4 months, prior to 
randomization in this study.

Table 37: Previous Anticancer Procedures and Radiotherapy – Full Analysis Set 
Percentages are based on the total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group in the Full Analysis Set. a: A subject may be 
counted in multiple categories. b: Previous anticancer procedures that were reported on the case report form by the investigator in the 
“other” category were varied, but were primarily hepatectomy, microwave therapy, biopsies, or pulmonary resections.  
Concomitant therapy 
Concomitant Medication: The proportion of subjects who received at least 1 concomitant medication was 
similar in the 2 treatment arms (>95%). A high proportion of patients took concomitant anti-hypertensive 
agents  (72.8%  and  67.6%,  in  the  lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  arms,  respectively).  Other  concomitant 
medications were generally balanced between the 2 arms. Thyroid preparations were administered more 
often in the lenvatinib arm (levothyroxine 13.6% vs 4.6%, respectively). Loperamide was used by more 
sorafenib-treated  subjects  (15.9%  of  lenvatinib  vs.  24.4%  of  sorafenib)  and  dermatological  agents/ 
emollients were more common with sorafenib. 
Concomitant  Palliative  Radiotherapy:  A  few  subjects  in  both  treatment  arms  received  low  dose,  short 
duration,  palliative  radiotherapy  during  the  study  (15  patients,  3.1%,  lenvatinib;  11  patients,  2.3%,

sorafenib). Most radiotherapy was to bone (13, 2.7% lenvatinib; 9 (1.9%) sorafenib) and was directed at 
a non-target lesion.   
Anticancer Medications and Procedures during Survival Follow-up: In the overall population, slight 
imbalance between the treatment arms was seen in the proportion of subjects who received any 
posttreatment anticancer therapy (anticancer medications and procedures): 51.1% (243/476) in the 
sorafenib versus 43.1% (206/478) in the lenvatinib arm. 
Posttreatment anticancer medication (not for a procedure), was given to 38.7% in the sorafenib 32.6% in 
the lenvatinib arm.

Sorafenib was the most common anti-cancer agent, given to 121 (25.3%) of lenvatinib treated subjects, 
whilst 56 (11.8%) of patients in the sorafenib arm restarted or continued sorafenib during survival follow-
up. A higher proportion of subjects in the sorafenib arm (9.5% [45] vs 3.1% [15]) received 
posttreatment anticancer therapy with investigational drugs, as many second-line trials targeted 
sorafenib failures and/or sorafenib-intolerant subjects.  
Anticancer procedures were performed during survival follow-up in comparable proportions of subjects in 
the 2 treatment arms: 25.5%, lenvatinib and 27.3%, sorafenib. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) was most common (14.4% vs. 17.0% of subjects in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arm, 
respectively). Regional chemotherapy was given to 4.8% of lenvatinib and 5.3% of sorafenib patients. 
The figures for radiotherapy to bone were 5.0%, lenvatinib and 4.8%, sorafenib.

The  ORR  analysis  in  the  PPS  was  supportive;  24.4%  in  the  lenvatinib  compared  with  9.3%  in  the 
sorafenib arm.  The difference between the treatment arms was 15.1% (95% CI: 10.4, 19.8). The odds 
ratio  was  3.19  (95%  CI:  2.18,  4.66),  which  was  statistically  significant  (P<0.00001)  in  favour  of 
lenvatinib treatment. 
Quality of Life 
Assessments of HRQoL scores were performed using the generic cancer HRQoL instrument (EORTC QLQ-
C30), the HCC-specific module (EORTC QLQ-HCC18), and the generic HRQoL instrument, EQ-5D.  
During  the  Randomization  Phase,  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  EORTC  QLQ-HCC18,  and  EQ-5D  were 
administered at Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1, and at the OTV. During the Extension Phase, 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-HCC18, and EQ-5D were administered on Day 1 of each treatment and 
during the OTV. 
Missing  data  were  evaluated  at  the  score  level  for  each  patient  at  each  cycle  to  assess  the  patterns  of 
missing  data  within  and  between  treatment  arms  for  potential  evaluation  in  subsequent  statistical 
analyses if required or deemed to be appropriate. Patients missing baseline data were excluded from the 
longitudinal analyses. No imputation for missing PRO data were conducted. 
Study  compliance  was  high  (>90%)  for  the  patient  outcome  measures  at  baseline  and  throughout  the 
Randomisation Phase, but interpretation was limited in later cycles due to the decline in patient numbers.

Under  half  of  the  total  population  was  observed  at  Cycle  6  (48.6%  and  48.1%  in  the  CSP  and  LPP, 
respectively) and one quarter at Cycle 12 (23.2% and 22.6% in the CSP and LPP, respectively). Baseline 
scores for all domains in the EORTC QLQ-HCC18, EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D were similar between the 
lenvatinib and sorafenib treatment arms. The QoL scores declined with both treatments and there was no 
significant difference between the 2 arms for most domains.

Overall Survival 
Sensitivity Analyses for OS based on stratification data in the CRF and without stratification factors 
Data used for stratification for the primary analysis were obtained by the IxRS. Stratification factors were 
region  (Asia-Pacific;  Western),  MPVI  or  extrahepatic  spread  or  both,  ECOG  PS  (PS  =  0;  1),  and  body 
weight  (<60  kg;  ≥60  kg).  When  comparing  the  stratification  -  factors  based  on  CRF-reported  data  to 
those  based  on  the  IxRS  data,  the  factor  ‘MPVI,  extrahepatic  spread  or  both’  had  a  discrepancy  of  87 
subjects, and the rest of the factors had no or few discrepancies (15 subjects for ECOG PS and 2 for body 
weight).  
Results  of  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  OS  for  the  FAS  based  on  the  stratification  data  recorded  on  the  CRF 
[median OS 13.6 vs. 12.3 months, stratified HR 0.91 (0.79, 1.06)] were highly consistent with the results 
obtained  with  the  primary  analysis  of  OS.  An  analysis  of  OS  without  stratification  factors  for  the  FAS

confirmed the results based on the primary OS analysis [median OS 13.6 months (95% CI 12.1, 14.9) vs. 
12.3 months (95% CI 10.4, 13.9), unstratified Cox Model HR 0.928 (95% CI 0.801, 1.077)].

If a stratification factor was same as the respective baseline characteristics, this stratification factor was excluded from stratified 
analysis. Aetiology was based on data from medical history. Prior procedure excluded prior radiotherapy. 
a: Hazard ratio was based on a Cox regression model including treatment group and the respective baseline characteristics (not 
included for overall population) as factors. Efron method was used for ties. 
For  baseline  AFP,  the  HR  for  lenvatinib:  sorafenib  was  0.856  (95%  CI:  0.736,  0.995).  Analysis  of  OS 
adjusted for baseline AFP category (<200 ng/mL, ≥200 ng/mL) was consistent with the primary analysis 
(4  subjects  without  baseline  AFP  values  were  excluded,  1  in the  lenvatinib  and  3  in  the  sorafenib  arm). 
Median OS with baseline AFP as a factor was 13.6 months (12.2, 14.9) vs. 12.3 months (10.6, 14.1) for 
lenvatinib and sorafenib respectively.

Selected anticancer medications presented when frequency in any region >5%  
Subject health status, including hepatic function, at the end of treatment visit was comparable between 
the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms in the Western region except for an imbalance in AFP concentration 
(median AFP: 124.6 ng/mL [Q1, Q3: 7.7, 3848 ng/mL] in the lenvatinib arm vs 45.9 ng/mL [Q1, Q3: 4.7, 
986.2 ng/mL] in the sorafenib arm). This reflected the imbalance between the arms at Baseline and the 
change from Baseline in AFP concentration was similar in both arms.  
Median OS was approximately 9 months longer in subjects who received post-treatment anticancer 
therapy than in those who did not.  In the lenvatinib arm, median OS was 19.5 months (95% CI: 15.7, 
23.0) for subjects who received post-treatment anticancer therapy (43%) and 10.5 months (95% CI: 8.6, 
12.2) for those who did not.  In the sorafenib arm, median OS was 17.0 months (95% CI: 14.2, 18.8) for 
subjects who received posttreatment anticancer therapy (51%) and 7.9 months (95% CI: 6.6, 9.7) for 
those who did not.  Median OS was longer by approximately 2.5 months in the lenvatinib compared with 
the sorafenib arm in both subsets of subjects (with or without post-treatment anticancer therapy). 
When adjusted for post-treatment anticancer therapy, the HR for OS favoured lenvatinib in both regions 
(table below).

extrahepatic spread or both (yes, no), ECOG PS (0, 1), and body weight (<60 kg, ≥60 kg). 
b: Status of posttreatment anticancer therapy (yes/no) was used as an additional covariate factor. 
Progression-free Survival 
Sensitivity Analysis for PFS 
A  stratified  analysis  of  PFS  using  all  disease  progression  and  death  events  was  done  as  a  sensitivity 
analysis using the FAS.  
PFS by subgroup 
Forest  plots  of  the  HRs  (lenvatinib:sorafenib)  in  PFS  for  selected  stratification  factors  in  the  IxRS  is 
presented in the figure below.

Time to Progression 
Sensitivity Analyses for TTP 
A stratified analysis of TTP using all disease progression events (subjects were not censored for missing 
assessments,  new  anticancer  therapy  or  treatment  discontinuation  for  reasons  other  than  PD)  was 
consistent  with  the  initial  results.  Median  TTP  was  7.6  months  for  lenvatinib  compared  with  3.7  months 
for sorafenib with an HR = 0.62, 95% CI of 0.54, 0.73, and P<0.00001.

As seen in the overall population, median TTP with stratification factors in the IxRS was longer with 
lenvatinib than sorafenib, with HR <1 in each of the subgroups tested. 
Objective Response Rate 
Subgroup analysis of ORR 
The ORR was consistently higher in the lenvatinib arm than in the sorafenib arm in each of the subgroups 
tested, with the exception of alcohol use, for which the number of subjects was small. 
The  ORR  with  lenvatinib  in  the  Western  region  (21.0%,  95%  CI:  14.6,  27.4)  was  consistent  with  that 
observed for the Asia-Pacific region (25.5%, (95% CI: 20.8, 30.3) and for the overall population (24.1%, 
95% CI: 20.2, 27.9). The odds ratios were 2.18 (1.15, 4.11) for the Western region, 3.77 (95% CI: 2.36, 
6.04) for the Asia-Pacific region, and 3.13 (95% CI: 2.15, 4.56) for the overall population. 
Post-hoc retrospective independent imaging review 
A post hoc, blinded IIR was conducted per an Independent Review Charter (IRC).  
At screening all but 5 subjects (4 lenvatinib, 1 sorafenib) had disease as identified by the IIR. In regard 
to  target  lesions  at  baseline,  33  patients  by  mRECIST  (18  lenvatinib,  15  sorafenib)  and  21  patients  by 
RECIST  1.1  (12  lenvatinib,  9  sorafenib)  did  not  have  lesions  meeting  requirement  for  a  target  lesion  at 
baseline. 
Although the proportion of subjects with cirrhosis was underreported based on CRF data (49.7%), further 
post-hoc analysis of screening scans using non-invasive imaging confirmed diagnosis of HCC in 74.5% for 
lenvatinib arm and 76.5% for sorafenib arm. 
A side-by-side summary of key efficacy results for both treatment arms, obtained using the investigator 
assessment (primary comparison) and the confirmatory blinded IIR using mRECIST, is presented in table 
below.

b: PFS rate and 95% CI calculated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and Greenwood Formula. 
c: Hazard ratio is for lenvatinib vs sorafenib, based on a Cox model including treatment arm as a factor. Efron method was used for 
ties. 
d: Stratified by region (Region 1: Asia-Pacific; Region 2: Western regions), macroscopic portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread or 
both (yes, no), ECOG PS (0, 1), and body weight (<60 kg, ≥60 kg). 
e: Follow-up time for PFS measured from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s last PFS follow-up, and had same 
numeric value but opposite censoring indicator as compared to PFS. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  using  all  PD  and  deaths  as  events  was  consistent  with  the  primary  PFS  analysis; 
median  PFS  was  6.6  months  for  lenvatinib  compared  with  3.7  months  for  sorafenib  with  an  HR  of  0.82 
(95% CI: 0.71, 0.94) and P=0.0047. 
TTP  -  Similarly,  median  TTP  as  assessed  by  blinded  IIR  using  mRECIST  was  consistent  with  the  median 
TTP obtained using the investigator assessment.

Mean time to first objective response for responders was shorter by IIR than Ix assessment (2.7 months 
for lenvatinib and 3.4 months for sorafenib by IIR vs. 3.6 and 4.8 months by Ix). For responders, median 
duration of response was 7.3 months for lenvatinib-treated subjects (n=194) and 6.2 months for 
sorafenib-treated subjects (n=59) by IIR compared to 7.3 months (n=115) and 11.2 months (n=44) by 
Ix assessment.  
Overall, agreement on best overall response (BOR) between the independent and investigator 
assessments was 62.6%. Agreement was higher for sorafenib (70.0%; 333/476) than lenvatinib (55.2%; 
264/478), driven by the high agreement on BOR of SD and PD in the sorafenib arm. Independent

reviewers assessed more instances of PR when investigators assessed SD, especially for subjects treated 
with lenvatinib (103 [21.5%]) as compared with sorafenib (29 [6.1%]).

EDR (Early Discordance Rate) = (number of subjects with INV PD earlier than IIR PD + number of subjects with INV PD and without IIR 
PD) / number of subjects with INV PD. 
LDR (Late Discordance Rate) = (number of subjects with INV PD later than IIR PD + number of subjects without INV PD but with IIR 
PD)/ (number of subjects with INV PD earlier than IIR PD + number of subjects with INV PD later than IIR PD + number of subjects 
without INV PD but with IIR PD + number of subjects with INV PD and without IIR PD). 
Differential discordance for EDR = Difference among EDR between 2 treatment arms. 
Differential discordance for LDR = Difference among LDR between 2 treatment arms. 
Discordance rates on timing of progression (EDR and LDR) were similar in the 2 arms (EDR: 28.3% in the 
lenvatinib arm vs 26.2% in the sorafenib arm; LDR: 64.1% in the lenvatinib arm vs 60.3% in the 
sorafenib arm), showing that there was no meaningful bias in the investigator results.  
IRR using RECIST 1.1 
Independent review of tumour assessments using RECIST 1.1 yielded similar results for both PFS (median 
7.3  months  lenvatinib  vs  3.6  months  sorafenib;  HR=0.65  [95%  CI:  0.56,  0.77;  p<0.00001]  )  and  TTP 
(median 7.4 months vs. 3.7 months; HR=0.61 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.72; p<0.00001]) as with mRECIST. As 
expected, the response rates for both arms were lower when using RECIST 1.1 (18.8% for lenvatinib vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018

6.5%  for  sorafenib)  than  with  mRECIST,  but  the  relative  benefit  of  lenvatinib  treatment  compared  with 
sorafenib by mRECIST was maintained (Odds ratio 3.34; 95% CI: 2.17, 5.14; p<0.00001). 
The  duration  of  objective  response  was  longer  in  sorafenib  arm  than  in  lenvatinib  arm:  15.8  (5.9,  NE) 
months vs 7.4 (5.6, 9.2) months, respectively. 
Efficacy results by dose of lenvatinib 
Efficacy by Lenvatinib Starting Dose (Body Weight Category) 
At the request of the CHMP, the MAH reviewed the efficacy data by starting dose of lenvatinib.  
Starting  dose  was  based  on  body  weight.  The  number  of  subjects  who  received  lenvatinib  by  starting 
dose  (8  mg,  n=151;  12  mg,  n=327)  was  nearly  identical  to  the  number  of  subjects  in  the  body  weight 
subgroups (<60 kg, n=153; ≥60 kg, n=325). The efficacy of lenvatinib by starting dose was based on the 
analysis by body weight category, as already presented in the subgroup analyses. Body weight was not a 
randomization factor; these were not planned analyses.

Comparison with historical studies of sorafenib (SHARP & Asia -Pacific) 
The  MAH  provided  Study E7080-G000-304  Constancy  Report  (10  July  2017).  To  evaluate  the  validity of 
the  constancy  assumption,  key  study  features  were  compared  among  Study  304  and  the  2  previous 
sorafenib  studies  (SHARP  and  Asia-Pacific).  These  features  included  characteristics  of  the  patient 
population,  inclusion/exclusion  (entry)  criteria,  concomitant  treatments  allowed,  sorafenib  dose,  and 
analytic  approach  for  determination  of  treatment  effect  (study  endpoints).  In  addition,  the  use  of 
posttreatment anticancer therapy among the 3 studies was also considered.

Study E7080-J081-202: A Phase 1/2 Study of E7080 in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) 
In  the  expansion  component  (Phase  2),  the  lenvatinib  12  mg  dose  (recommended  Phase  2  dose)  was 
tested in subjects with advanced HCC and hepatic function of CP scores of 5–6.  
In  total  46  subjects  were  enrolled.  Subjects  were  permitted  to  receive  up  to  1  prior  systemic  therapy, 
including targeted therapy or transarterial infusion chemotherapy.  
The  expansion  component  was  primarily  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  (TTP  based  on  independent 
review  assessments  using  mRECIST  in  Per  Protocol  Population)  and  safety  of  lenvatinib  at  the 
recommended dose. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR, DCR, OS, and PFS based on mRECIST.  
The Safety  Analysis Set, FAS, PK Analysis  Set and the PD Analysis Set were identical (N= 46). The PPS 
(N=41)  excluded  5  subjects;  1  subject  did  not  meet  inclusion  criterion  #3  (baseline  haematology  and 
renal laboratory values),  3 subjects discontinued during the 2 cycles and 1 subject did not show ≥75%

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  main  study  E7080-G000-304  (REFLECT  or  Study  304)  was  a  multi-centre,  randomized,  open-label, 
non-inferiority Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-
line systemic treatment in subjects with unresectable HCC.  
For  the  main  Study  304,  sorafenib  as  comparator  is  acceptable  in  the  first  line  treatment  for  advanced 
disease since it is the only medicine approved in this setting for systemic treatment and is considered as 
a standard of care.  
The primary endpoint of OS is supported as the most relevant and unbiased measure of efficacy. 
In view of non-inferiority design, several critical aspects were highlighted at the time of CHMP scientific 
advice, like internal validity, internal consistency and external validity. The enrolment of an adequate 
number of patients from EU population was advised. 
The trial was well–conducted. Very few randomised subjects were not treated (3 in total) and the rate of 
major protocol deviations was low (2.5%) and balanced across the treatment arms.  
Still,  the  trial  was  open-label,  which  always  introduces  the  possibility  of  investigator  bias  in  terms  of 
adjudication  of  progression.  Most  subjects  in  both  treatment  arms  received  study  drug  until  PD  as 
stipulated  in  the  protocol,  but  more  had  no  progression  at  the  time  of  treatment  discontinuation  in  the 
lenvatinib than the sorafenib arm (97 vs. 60 in the TTP analysis, 66 vs 49 in the PFS analysis). This may 
be due to safety concerns as discussed later.  
Patients  were  to  have  advanced/unresectable  HCC  suitable  for  palliative  treatment  but  very  advanced 
disease  was  excluded.  Patients  had  stage  BCLC  B  (multiple  liver  tumours)  or  BCLC  C  (portal  vein 
invasion/ extrahepatic spread) HCC but with liver function adequately maintained – CP A (score of 5 or 6) 
and PS 0-1. Patients with very heavy liver involvement (≥50% occupation), clear invasion into the main

portal  vein  or  bile  duct,  or  any  blood-enhancing  treatment  within  28  days  of  randomization  were 
excluded.  Patients  could  have  received  prior  local  therapy  but  not  systemic  therapy  alone  for  advanced 
disease.  
The comparability of the patient populations among Study 304 and the historical trials was evaluated. The 
geographical patient pool of the SHARP and the Asia-Pacific trials are comparable to the Western and the 
Asia-Pacific regions of the Study 304, respectively. 
The overall patient populations of Study 304 and the historical SHARP and Asia Pacific trials were similar 
with regard to demographic and key disease characteristics.  
The  baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  of  Study  304  were  reasonably  well  matched 
between the 2 treatment groups for the overall population, except a greater proportion with baseline AFP 
>200 ng/ml in the lenvatinib arm and more subjects with underlying hepatitis C in the sorafenib arm.   
With a higher threshold, the proportion of subjects with a baseline AFP concentration of ≥400 ng/mL was 
40.8%  (195  subjects)  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  and  34.7%  (165  subjects)  in  the  sorafenib  arm.    Both 
imbalances might favour the sorafenib arm.  
The  aetiology,  course  and  prognosis  of  HCC  differ  by  regions,  with  epidemiologic  risk  factors  varying 
greatly. At the time of scientific advice the Applicant was requested to enrol at least one third of patients 
in the Western region. 
In  both  the  Asia-Pacific  and  Western  regions,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  baseline  AFP  levels  ≥200 
ng/mL was greater in the lenvatinib than in the sorafenib arm, although the difference was greatest in the 
Western region: 48.9% vs 42.9%, respectively, for the Asia-Pacific, and 41.4% vs 31.8% for the Western 
region. Regarding the proportion of subjects with baseline hepatitis C, for lenvatinib vs. sorafenib this was 
26.1% vs. 35.7% in the West (15.6% vs 21.9% Asia Pacific). 
Still,  other  factors  such  as  BCLC  stage  of  disease  were  well  balanced  between  the  regions;  BCLC  C 
(advanced stage) was 78.3% vs. 82.8% for lenvatinib vs. sorafenib in the West and 78.2% vs. 79.6% for 
lenvatinib  vs.  sorafenib  in  the  Asia-Pacific.  The  proportion  with  MVPI/  extrahepatic  spread,  one  of  the 
stratification  factors,  was  requested  by  treatment  group  by  region.    MPVI/  EHS  were  shown  to  be  well 
balanced between the treatment arms although a lower proportion of sorafenib compared with lenvatinib 
treated  subjects  had  MPVI  alone  in  the  Western  region.  Subjects  with  MVPI/  EHS  had  a  shorter  median 
OS  regardless  of  the  treatment  arm.  Non-inferiority  of  lenvatinib  vs.  sorafenib  was  maintained  for  all 
subgroups of MVPI/ EHS. 
The  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  sorafenib  arm  were  sufficiently  similar  to  those  of  the 
historical  sorafenib  trials  to  allow  cross-study  comparison  in  terms  of  sorafenib  efficacy  to  support  the 
evaluation of non-inferiority in the current study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results – primary endpoint  
Non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib for OS, the primary endpoint of the study, has been convincingly 
demonstrated.  The  OS  data  are  sufficiently  mature  (about  75%).  However,  superiority  could  not  be 
shown  (median  OS  13.6  vs.  12.3  months  for  lenvatinib  vs.  sorafenib).  The  per  protocol  analysis  was 
similar  to  the  FAS,  as  were  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  stratification  factors  in  the  CRF  (rather  than 
IxRS) and without stratification factors.  
Subjects  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  were  censored  at  the  last  date  the  subject  was  known  to  be  alive, 
and subjects who remained alive were censored at the time of data cut-off.

The  MAH  indicated  imbalances  in  the  use  of  posttreatment  anticancer  therapy,  as  well  as  imbalances  in 
some  baseline  factors  (ie,  AFP,  HCV  aetiology)  in  the  sorafenib  arm  overall,  appeared  to  have  favoured 
sorafenib for OS, which resulted in a higher hazard ratio in the Western region. 
At the end of study treatment, subjects on the sorafenib arm were naturally eligible for potential second-
line trials specifically requiring enrollment of sorafenib failures and/or sorafenib-intolerant patients, while 
lenvatinib  patients  would  be  typically  ineligible  for  such  trials.  Consequently,  a  higher  proportion  of 
subjects received post-study treatment with investigational anticancer drugs in the sorafenib arm (9.5%) 
vs lenvatinib (3.1%). These factors might favour the sorafenib arm, but no definitive conclusions can be 
made to this regard. Subgroup analyses for OS revealed that the effect of lenvatinib and sorafenib on OS 
was generally consistent across subgroups. Amongst the subgroup analyses, the only exception was the 
Western  Region  where  the  median  OS  for  lenvatinib  was  13.6  months  compared  to  14.2  months  for 
sorafenib, resulting in an HR of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.42). Still, this HR does not deviate far from 1.00 
and the median OS difference is only 0.6 months. 
Median OS for sorafenib in the Western region in Study 304 was higher than that in the full sorafenib trial 
population  (12.3  months)  and  higher  than  the  median  OS  in  the  historic  SHARP  trial  (10.7  months), 
which  was  conducted  in  Western  countries.  Furthermore,  the  median  OS  of  sorafenib  in  the  Asia-Pacific 
region (11.0 months) in Study 304 was higher than the median OS of sorafenib in the historic Asia-Pacific 
trial  (6.5  months;  95%  CI:  5.6,  7.6).    The  possible  reason  for  the  higher  OS  of  sorafenib  in  Study  304 
compared to historical sorafenib studies may be the greater use of posttreatment anticancer therapies, as 
explained by the MAH.  
Overall,  the  KM  curves  and  HR  are  consistent  with  non-inferiority  in  OS  for  lenvatinib  vs  sorafenib  in 
patients ≥ 75 years. The secondary efficacy endpoints favoured lenvatinib in this subgroup.  
Efficacy results – secondary endpoints  
The  results  of  secondary  analyses  support  those  reported  for  primary  analyses,  however  statistically 
significant  differences  in  secondary  endpoints  do  not  appear  to  translate  into  the  OS  benefit,  with 
potential underlying reasons discussed above. 
Lenvatinib  treatment  resulted  in  improvement  over  sorafenib  for  PFS  (median  PFS,  7.4  vs  3.7  months, 
respectively; HR=0.66; 95% CI of 0.57, 0.77, P<0.00001) for this population of patients. Median follow-
up time was 20.3 and 19.2 months for the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, respectively. Median TTP with 
lenvatinib  was  longer  than  that  of  sorafenib:  8.9  months  for  lenvatinib  versus  3.7  months  for  sorafenib 
(HR = 0.63; P<0.00001).  
Taken together, PFS and TTP were the same for sorafenib but the benefit on progression was greater for 
lenvatinib in the TTP analysis (8.9 vs 3.7 months) where deaths before progression were not considered 
as an event compared to the PFS results (7.4 vs. 3.7 months).   
Lenvatinib treatment significantly prolonged TTP compared to sorafenib. However, neither PFS benefit nor 
TTP benefit translated to OS improvement. The observed TTP in the lenvatinib arm was longer than the 
duration of treatment (5.7 months), while it was similar to the duration of treatment in the sorafenib arm 
(3.7 months). 
The  ORR  by  investigator  assessment  was  increased  for  lenvatinib  compared  with  sorafenib  (24.1%  vs. 
9.2%)  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  lenvatinib  patients  with  PR  (22.8  vs.  8.8%).  This 
result included all responses; there was no consideration of confirmed responses, as tumour assessments 
were conducted every 8 weeks. The duration of response in responders was longer for sorafenib (11.2 vs. 
7.3 months), albeit with overlapping 95% confidence intervals, whilst the proportion with durable stable 
disease  (≥23  weeks)  was  higher  for  lenvatinib  (34.9%  vs.  29.2%).  By  IRR,  the  duration  of  objective 
response  was  7.4  (5.6,  9.2)  months  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  and  15.8  (5.9,  NE)  months  in  the  sorafenib

arm. 
The  ORR  with  lenvatinib  in  the  Western  region  (21.0%,  95%  CI:  14.6,  27.4)  was  consistent  with  that 
observed for the Asia-Pacific region (25.5%, (95% CI: 20.8, 30.3) and for the overall population (24.1%, 
95% CI: 20.2, 27.9). The odds ratios were 2.18 (1.15, 4.11) for the Western region, 3.77 (95% CI: 2.36, 
6.04) for the Asia-Pacific region, and 3.13 (95% CI: 2.15, 4.56) for the overall population.  
The  results  of  IIR  using  mRECIST  or  RECIST  1.1  both  supported  the  results  of  the  investigator-based 
assessments. 
The  PFS  and  TTP  subgroup  analysis  consistently  favoured  lenvatinib.  The  only  ORR  subgroup  that 
favoured  sorafenib  was  alcohol  but  this  involved  a  small  number  of  patients  with  wide  confidence 
intervals and PFS/ TTP still favoured lenvatinib.  
The  primary  endpoint  and  key  secondary  endpoint  results  were  similar  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  per  the  2 
starting doses, as assessed based on body weight category (<60kg vs. ≥60kg). Lenvatinib dose was not 
adjusted based on change in body weight during treatment. Lenvatinib dose adjustments were performed 
only  for  individual  subjects  who  experienced  lenvatinib-related  toxicity  as  pre-specified  in  the  dose-
modification section of the protocol.  
PFS on sorafenib post lenvatinib in comparison to the other post lenvatinib therapies was investigated to 
assess whether sorafenib remains a useful option in this patient population (data not shown). There was 
no  difference  in  PFS2  (based  on  the  surrogate  duration  of  next  line  therapy)  between  patients  who 
received sorafenib compared with another therapy post progression on lenvatinib.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  OS  over  sorafenib  has  been  demonstrated  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy. 
Secondary endpoints support the primary analysis.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data for the new HCC indication are taken from Study 304 and from Study 202. Two sets are 
defined: The HCC randomized safety data coming from study 304, a randomized, sorafenib controlled trial 
and  the  All  HCC  Lenvatinib  Safety  Set  that  contain  the  data  of  20  additional  patients  (4%  of  this  last 
database).  In  absence  of  a  placebo  control  arm,  a  third  set  of  non  HCC  patients  (monotherapy)  is  also 
used to contrast safety issues more likely linked to the disease and/or the patient condition.  
The “HCC Randomized Safety Set” (N = 476) 
This set corresponds to the study 304 safety data. In this study subjects with advanced/unresectable HCC 
were randomized and treated with either lenvatinib (476 patients; 12 mg or 8 mg QD by oral dosing) or 
sorafenib  (475  patients;  400  mg  BID  by  oral  dosing)  in  a  1:1  ratio.  The  starting  dose  of  lenvatinib  was 
based on baseline BW: 12 mg QD for subjects with a BW of ≥60 kg (325 pts) and 8 mg QD for subjects 
with a BW of <60 kg (151 pts). The cutoff date for the study 304 safety data was 13 Nov 2016.  
The “All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set” (N = 496) 
This  set  corresponds to  the  data  of  study 304  (HCC  Randomized  Safety  Set) to  which  have  been  added 
the safety data of 20 patients of study 202.   
In  Study  202,  the  maximum  tolerated  (MTD)  was  determined  in  subjects  with  Child-Pugh  (CP)  Class  A 
(CP score of 5 to 6) and CP Class B. The MTD found for subjects with Child-Pugh Class A was 12 mg QD 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 93/151 
 
  
  
and  in  an  extension  Phase  2,  all  subjects  (CP  Class  A)  were  treated  with  this 12  mg  dose  of  lenvatinib. 
However, only the safety data for the 20 subjects in Phase 2 who had baseline BW ≥60 kg and received 
at  least  1  dose  of  lenvatinib  12  mg  QD  (ie  the  dosing  matching  the  recommendations  for  the  sough 
indication) were included in the “All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set”. Safety information for the additional 26 
subjects in Study 202 who took lenvatinib 12 mg QD but weighed <60 kg is presented in the Study 202 
CSR.  
The “Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set” (N=1327) 
This set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib monotherapy in the following 14 
studies  that  evaluated  various  tumour  types  (including  DTC  and  RCC):  E7080-G000-201,  -203,  -204,  -
205  (only  monotherapy  arm),  -206,  209,  -303  (both  Randomized  and  optional  open-label)  and  -398; 
E7080-J081-105 and – 208;  E7080-A001-102; E7080-E044-101 and -104; E7080-703.  
In  this  safety  set,  1130/1327  (85%)  subjects  received  a  lenvatinib  starting  dose  of  24  mg  QD  and  an 
additional  7  subjects  received  a  total  daily  dose  of  24  mg  (12  mg  BID);  the  remaining  subjects  were 
enrolled  in  dose-finding  studies  and  received  a  range  of  lenvatinib  starting  doses  of  0.2  to  32  mg  daily 
(Appendix  1).  The  safety  data  cutoff  date  was  01  Sep  2016  for  ongoing  studies;  for  studies  completed 
before 01 Sep 2016, their respective completion dates were used.

Patient exposure 
In  the  Study  304,  51%  of  the  subjects  on  the  8  mg  lenvatinib  dose  and  36%  of  those  on  the  12  mg 
lenvatinib dose received 100% of their planned starting dosage (overall 41% of subjects in the lenvatinib 
arm).    In  addition  24%  of  patients  on  the  8  mg  lenvatinib  dose  and  30%  of  patients  on  the  12  dose 
received  at  least  80%  of  the  planned  dosing  (overall  27.7%  for  the  lenvatinib  arm).  Thus  75%  (8  mg 
group)  and  66%  (12  mg  group)  of  patients  received  at  least  80%  of  the  planned  dose.  Three  subjects 
received  accidentally  higher  than  planned  doses  (2  patients  received  once  24  mg  of  lenvatinib  and  one 
patient received one dose of 120 mg). 
In  the  sorafenib  arm,  33.9%  of  subjects  received  100%  of  their  planned  dosage;  an  additional  31.2% 
received at least 80% of the planned dosage. Overall 65 % of the patients received at least 80% of the 
planned  dosage but  more patients  received less  than  60%  of  the  planned  dosage  than  in  the  lenvatinib 
arm. 
Regarding dose intensity, the patients received on ‘average’ 87.5% of the planned dose in the lenvatinib 
arm  and  83%  of  the  planned  dose  in  the  sorafenib  arm.  In  both  treatment  arms,  exposure  (ie,  dose 
intensity)  versus  planned  dose  was  high,  and  the  percentage  of  planned  dose  received  was  similar 
between the 2 arms or slightly higher for lenvatinib.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group in the Safety Analysis Set.  
Dose Intensity = Total dose received during the study/(Date of last dose of study drug -Date of first dose of study drug + 1). 
Max = maximum; Min = minimum; Q1, Q3 = first quartile, third quartile; SD = standard deviation.  
8 mg and 12 mg were the starting doses of lenvatinib based on the subjects’ body weight (<60 kg, ≥60 kg) at Baseline 
Duration of treatment (months) = (Date of last dose of study drug -Date of first dose of study drug + 1) ÷ 30.4375.  
Number of subject-months = Sum of all months that all subjects received study drug based on treatment duration. 
Defined as the actual dose received as a percentage of planned starting dose (without interruption or reduction). Calculated as 
cumulative total dose divided by (planned starting daily dose × treatment duration in days).

213 (65.5)  
294 (61.8)  
81 (53.6)  
264 (55.6)  
Related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug or 
TEAEs with a missing causality. AE = adverse event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for AEs; TEAE = treatment-
emergent AE.  
a:  8 mg and 12 mg were the lenvatinib starting doses based on the subjects’ body weight (<60 kg, ≥60 kg) at Baseline.  
b:  Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.0.  
c:  Subjects may be counted in more than 1 subcategory.  
Category includes 70 subjects who had a TEAE ongoing at the time of death due to disease progression or whose cause of 
death was unknown.  
d: 
Exposure  was  1.5-times  longer  with  lenvatinib  than  with  sorafenib.  Therefore,  TEAEs  have  also  been 
adjusted  by  treatment  duration.  As  shown  in  the  table  below  the  rate  of  TEAE  episodes  adjusted  for 
treatment duration was 18.89 episodes/SY and 19.73 episodes/SY for the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, 
respectively.

Data cutoff date: 13 Nov 2016. Related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to study drug or TEAEs with a missing causality. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.0. An AE episode was 
based on MedDRA LLT. A single episode was defined from onset through resolution or, if ongoing, to the end of reporting period. 
Subjects with fatal SAEs may also have reported nonfatal SAEs. 
Total Duration = sum of treatment time (in years) for all subjects in each treatment group (including dose interruption). AE Rate 
(episode/subject-year) = total occurrence of AE episode (n) divided by total duration in each treatment group. AE = adverse 
event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; LLT = low level term; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities; PD = disease progression; SAE = serious adverse events; SY = subject-year; TEAE = treatment-emergent 
adverse event.

Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set:  01  Sep  2016  (for  ongoing  studies).  In  the  Non-HCC  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy 
Safety Set, 85% of subjects received a starting dose of 24 mg QD. Display is in decreasing order of AE rate of PTs in 
the lenvatinib group of the HCC Randomized Safety Set. Adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA version 19.1. 
Subject  Incidence:  Subjects  with  2  or  more  TEAEs  reported  in  the  same  SOC  or  PT  were  counted  only  once. 
Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the corresponding safety set within the relevant treatment 
group. Treatment Exposure-adjusted Rate: AE episode is based on MedDRA LLT. A single episode is defined from onset 
through  resolution  or,  if  ongoing,  to  the  end  of  reporting  period.  (*)  PPE:  Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome AE = adverse event; HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma; PPE = Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome;

Severe (Grade 3 and 4) TEAEs 
A summary of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurring in ≥1% of subjects in any group of the safety sets is 
presented in the Table 66 below.  
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in 357 subjects (75%) in the lenvatinib arm and 316 subjects (66.5%) 
in the sorafenib arm.  
Adjusted  by  treatment  duration,  the  rate  of  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  in  the  lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  arms  was 
3.16 and 3.33 episodes/SY, respectively. 
There were higher incidences of Grade 3 WBC (2.4% vs 0.2%) and neutrophil (2.6% vs 0.2%) decreased 
counts in the All HCC than in the Non-HCC Safety Set.

Data  cutoff  date  for  HCC  Randomized  and  All  HCC  Lenvatinib  Safety  Sets:  13  Nov  2016.  Data  cutoff  date  for  Non-HCC  Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy  Safety  Set:  01  Sep  2016  (for  ongoing  studies).  In  the  Non-HCC  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set,  85%  of  subjects 
received a starting dose of 24 mg QD. Display is in decreasing order of Grade 3 AE rate in the lenvatinib group of the HCC Randomized 
Safety Set. AE episode is based on MedDRA LLT. A single episode is defined from onset through resolution or, if ongoing, to the end of 
reporting  period.  Adverse  Event  terms  were  coded  using  MedDRA  version  19.1.  Total  Exposure  (SY)  =  sum  of  treatment  duration  (in 
years) for all subjects in each treatment group (including dose interruption). AE Rate (episode/SY) = total occurrence of TEAE episodes 
(n) divided by the total exposure (SY) for the specified treatment group. AE = adverse event; HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma; ISS = 
Integrated Summary of Safety;  LLT =  low  level term; MedDRA  =  Medical Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities; QD = once  daily; SY  = 
subject year; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

Data cutoff date for HCC Randomized and All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Sets: 13 Nov 2016. Data cutoff date for Non-HCC Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set: 01 Sep 2016 (for ongoing studies). In the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, 85% of subjects 
received a starting dose of 24 mg QD. Serious AEs include any AEs that met the criteria for seriousness, whether fatal or nonfatal. 
Display is in decreasing order of AE rate of preferred terms in the Lenvatinib group of the HCC Randomized Safety Set. Adverse event 
terms were coded using MedDRA version 19.1. Subject Incidence: Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported in the same PT term were 
counted only once. Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the corresponding safety set within the relevant treatment 
group. AE Rate (episode/SY) = total occurrence of TEAE episodes (n) divided by the total exposure (SY) for the specified treatment 
group. AE = adverse event; HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma; ISS = Integrated Summary of Safety; LLT = low level term; MedDRA = 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PT = preferred term; QD = once daily; SAE = serious adverse event; SY = subject year; 
TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.  
The SAEs reported were generally of comparable types to those in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set, exception for hepatic-related SAEs. 
Adjusted by treatment duration, the overall rate of SAEs was 1.26 episodes/SY for the lenvatinib arm and 
0.97 episodes/SY for the sorafenib arm.

Data cutoff date for HCC Randomized and All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Sets: 13 Nov 2016. Data cutoff date for Non-HCC Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set: 01 Sep 2016 (for ongoing studies). In the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, 85% of subjects 
received a starting dose of 24 mg QD. Display is in decreasing order of AE rate of PTs in the lenvatinib group of the HCC Randomized 
Safety Set. Adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA version 19.1. 
Subject Incidence: Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported in the same PT term were counted only once. Percentages are based on the 
total number of subjects in the corresponding safety set within the relevant treatment group. AE Rate (episode/SY) = total occurrence 
of TEAE episodes (n) divided by the total exposure (SY) for the specified treatment group. AE = adverse event; HCC = hepatocellular 
carcinoma; ISS = Integrated Summary of Safety; LLT = low level term; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PT = 
preferred term; QD = once daily; SY = subject year; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Adjusted for treatment duration, the overall rate of fatal AE episodes was 0.19 episodes/SY in the 
lenvatinib and 0.15 episodes/SY in the sorafenib arm. The rate of fatal AE episodes was higher in the 
lenvatinib arm compared with the sorafenib arm for hepatic failure sepsis and cerebral haemorrhage. 
The rate of fatal AEs that were not related to PD was 0.06 and 0.03 episodes/SY in the lenvatinib and 
sorafenib arms, respectively.

The occurrence of fatal AEs by treatment arm was analysed based on Kaplan-Meier methodology. The 
fatal AE-free rate was similar between the 2 treatment arms until Month 7. The sorafenib curve flattens at 
an earlier time point than the lenvatinib. This is attributed to the fact that ~70% sorafenib patients have 
discontinued treatment by Month 7 (3rd quartile for treatment duration 7.4 months vs. 11.1 months for 
lenvatinib). Fatal AEs are captured up to 30 days after last study drug dose. Beyond that, any death only 
counts as an event for the OS analysis.

Subjects who did not have a fatal AE were censored at the earliest of 1) treatment end date + 30 days, 2) last date known to be alive 
(if subject did not die during the study), 3) date of death not caused by a fatal AE, 4) study cut-off date.

Data cutoff date for HCC Randomized and All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Sets: 13 Nov 2016. Data cutoff date for Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set: 01 Sep 2016 (for ongoing studies). In the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set, 85% of subjects received a starting dose of 24 mg QD. Serious AEs include any events that met the criteria for 
seriousness, whether fatal or nonfatal. For each row category, a subject with 2 or more AEs in that category was counted 
only once. AE Rate (episode/SY) = total occurrence of TEAE episodes (n) divided by the total exposure (SY) for the 
specified treatment group. AE = adverse event; CMQ = customized MedDRA query; CTCAE = Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse 
Events; HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma; ISS = Integrated Summary of Safety; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities; QD = once daily; SAE = serious adverse event; SY = subject year; TEAE = treatment emergent 
adverse event. 
a: If a subject had more than 1 TEAE, the subject was only counted once at the maximum grade. 
b: Study drug modification includes dose reduction or interruption. A subject could be counted in both categories if the 
subject had TEAEs leading to both dose interruption and dose reduction. 
Hepatic Encephalopathy 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 40 subjects (8.4%) in the lenvatinib and 13 subjects (2.7%) in the 
sorafenib arm had an event of hepatic encephalopathy per CMQ (including PTs of hepatic encephalopathy, 
encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathy and coma hepatic). The event was Grade ≥3 in 26 subjects in 
the lenvatinib and 9 in the sorafenib arm; 4 subjects in the lenvatinib arm had a Grade 5 event. Hepatic 
encephalopathy was considered by the investigator as related to study drug in 18 lenvatinib and 4 
sorafenib-treated subjects.  
Hepatic encephalopathy was associated with PD for 13 subjects in the lenvatinib arm (12 received a 
starting dose of 12 mg and 1 received 8 mg) and 6 subjects in the sorafenib arm. The 13 lenvatinib-
treated subjects include Subject 19011002 who had a fatal AE of hepatic coma that was not recorded as 
PD and a fatal AE of portal vein thrombosis that was considered PD by the investigator. An additional 5 
lenvatinib-treated subjects (4 starting on 12 mg and 1 on 8 mg) had hepatic encephalopathy 7 days 
before or after discontinuation of study drug due to PD (radiologic or clinical). 
Hepatic encephalopathy resulted in dose modification (interruption/reduction) in 21 subjects in the 
lenvatinib and 4 subjects in the sorafenib arm; 8 and 1 patient, respectively, discontinued treatment. 
The percentage of subjects with cirrhosis at Baseline per the IIR was higher in subjects with hepatic 
encephalopathy than in the overall population. Lenvatinib-treated subjects who developed hepatic 
encephalopathy, particularly within 30 days of starting study drug, had worse baseline liver disease than 
subjects in the lenvatinib arm overall and sorafenib-treated subjects who developed hepatic 
encephalopathy. Baseline characteristics included higher mean/median ammonia concentration, greater 
frequency of MPVI, greater proportion of subjects with a CP score ≥6 (including 2 subjects with the score

of 7), greater liver tumour burden (measured by sums of the diameters) and cirrhosis. Most subjects had 
either Grade 0 or Grade 1 baseline AST, ALT and ALP levels and no correlation with the occurrence of 
hepatic encephalopathy was seen. No significant relationship between lenvatinib exposure and hepatic 
encephalopathy was detected within the exposure range of Study 304. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred 
more frequently in subjects aged 75 years and older. 
Hepatic Failure 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 17 subjects (3.6%) in the lenvatinib and 12 subjects (2.5%) in the 
sorafenib arm had an event of hepatic failure per CMQ (including the PTs of hepatic failure, acute hepatic 
failure and chronic hepatic failure). Grade 5 hepatic failure per CMQ was reported in 12 lenvatinib- and 2 
sorafenib-treated subjects. Hepatic failure was considered by the investigator as related to study drug in 
6 lenvatinib- and 3 sorafenib-treated subjects. For 9 subjects in the lenvatinib arm (6 starting on 12 mg 
and 3 on 8 mg) and 6 subjects in the sorafenib arm, the hepatic failure was also associated with PD by 
the investigator. Hepatic failure resulted in dose modification (interruption/reduction) in 3 lenvatinib- and 
in 2 sorafenib-treated subjects. Review of baseline characteristics showed that lenvatinib-treated subjects 
with hepatic failure had worse baseline liver disease than the overall lenvatinib population and the 
sorafenib -treated subjects with hepatic failure. Baseline characteristics for subjects with hepatic failure 
included CP score of 6 or 7, greater frequency of MPVI, alpha-fetoprotein concentration ≥200 ng/mL, 
higher mean/median ammonia concentration and the presence of cirrhosis, per the independent imaging 
review. Baseline AST, ALT and ALP concentrations were either Grade 0 or 1 for most subjects who had 
hepatic failure and no correlation with hepatic failure was seen.

factors that could have triggered the Grade 5 hepatic event. These included i) hepatic haemorrhage, ii) 
lung infection and sepsis, and iii) bacterial peritonitis and previous AE of gastroenteritis.  
Hepatic-related deaths are not unusual in this patient population with advanced HCC, underlying cirrhosis, 
and hepatitis. In the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, 0.3% of subjects had Grade 5 hepatic 
failure by PT. 
Discontinuations: Twenty six of 227 subjects (11.5%) who had a hepatotoxicity event (any grade),in the 
lenvatinib arm and 14 of 198 subjects (7.1%) in the sorafenib arm discontinued treatment for the event. 
The median time to first onset was 6.4 weeks in the lenvatinib arm and 4.4 weeks in the sorafenib arm of 
study 304.  
The  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  per  CMQ  was  evaluated  by  age,  sex,  race,  ECOC  PS,  baseline  renal 
function, baseline hepatic function, and region.  
Comparison  with  the  Non-HCC  safety  set:  As  expected,  the  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  events  per  CMQ 
was  higher  in  the  All  HCC  Lenvatinib  Safety  Set  (47.6%;  1.94  episodes/SY)  than  in  the  Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (23.3%; 0.50 episodes/SY).  
Pancreatitis  
The evaluation of pancreatitis includes both an analysis of the CMQ of pancreatitis based on AE reports 
and an analysis of laboratory values for serum amylase and lipase. 
Events were Grade ≥3 for 14 subjects (2.9%) in the lenvatinib arm and 12 subjects (2.5%) in the 
sorafenib arm. There was 1 death in the lenvatinib arm and none in the sorafenib arm: Subject 19061007 
in the lenvatinib arm had an SAE of acute pancreatitis, which resulted in discontinuation of study drug, 
and ultimately death (however, 3 additional Grade 5 AEs were reported for this subject: bile duct 
obstruction, hepatic failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; all due to PD and not related to 
treatment, as reported by the investigator). 
Grade 3 or 4 increased lipase was observed at a similar incidence in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set 
(6.4%) and the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (6.6%). Grade 3 or 4 increased amylase 
was observed at a lower incidence in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (1.1%) than the Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (3.6%). 
Results were generally similar in the lenvatinib arm of the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the All HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set, and the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
There were no additional events of pancreatitis per CMQ in All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set. The incidence 
of pancreatitis per CMQ was 3.8% in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set and 5.0% in the Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (Arterial TE events) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of arterial TE events per CMQ was comparable in the 
lenvatinib and sorafenib arms: 2.3% (11/476) and 1.7% (8/475), respectively, and 0.04 episodes/SY in 
each arm when adjusted by treatment exposure. The most frequently reported arterial TE events were MI 
(lenvatinib, 4 [0.8%]; sorafenib, 1 [0.2%]) and cerebral infarction (lenvatinib, 3 [0.6%]; sorafenib, 0). 
Most were SAEs (10 in the lenvatinib and 6 in the sorafenib arm). There were 3 deaths due to arterial TE 
events in the lenvatinib arm: 2 subjects with cerebrovascular accident and 1 subject with MI. All 3 
subjects had relevant medical history and comorbidities and were at increased risk. There are no 
changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib regarding arterial TE events. 
Haemorrhage 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of haemorrhage events per SMQ was higher in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 113/151 
 
  
  
lenvatinib than sorafenib arm: 24.6% (117/476) and 16.0% (76/475), respectively, 0.54 and 0.43 
episodes/SY adjusted by treatment exposure. Grade 1 and 2 events contributed to the difference in 
incidence (93 subjects [19.5%] in the lenvatinib arm and 54 subjects [11.4%] in the sorafenib arm). The 
incidence of Grade ≥3 events was similar between treatment arms: 24 subjects (5.0%) in the lenvatinib 
arm and 22 subjects (4.6%) in the sorafenib arm. 
The most frequently reported haemorrhage events in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, respectively, 
were epistaxis (34 subjects [7.1%; 0.10 episodes/SY]; 15 [3.2%; 0.07 episodes/SY]), haematuria (25 
subjects [5.3%; 0.10 episodes/SY]; 10 [2.1%; 0.05 episodes/SY]) and gingival bleeding (18 subjects 
[3.8%; 0.06 episodes/SY]; 9 [1.9%; 0.05 episodes/SY]). 
Incidence of serious haemorrhage events was similar in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms: 25 subjects 
(5.3%; 0.09 episodes/SY) and 21 subjects (4.4%; 0.12 episodes/SY), respectively. The most frequently 
reported serious events were: oesophageal varices haemorrhage (7 subjects [1.5%; 0.02 episodes/SY]; 5 
[1.1%; 0.03 episodes/SY]) and upper GI haemorrhage (5 subjects [1.1%; 0.02 episodes/SY]; 2 [0.4%; 
0.01 episodes/SY]). These SAEs are consistent with complications of underlying liver disease, including 
coagulopathy, varices, and portal hypertension. 
There were 8 (1.7%) Grade 5 haemorrhage events in the lenvatinib arm and 5 (1.1%) in the sorafenib 
arm. The 8 Grade 5 TEAEs comprised 3 subjects with cerebral haemorrhage and relevant risk factors 
(Subject 14071003 – history of hypertension; 24041001 - history of cerebrovascular malformation 
surgery and cerebral haemorrhage and 24111035 - AEs of BP increase and aortic dissection), 2 subjects 
with upper GI haemorrhage (Subjects 24041001 and 24111029), and 1 subject each with disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (Subject 12141007), intestinal haemorrhage (Subject 19011014) and tumour 
haemorrhage (Subject 44031005).  
In the sorafenib arm, the 5 Grade 5 TEAEs were 2 subjects with upper GI haemorrhage (Subjects 
24021011 and 24111045), and 1 subject each with traumatic hematoma (Subject 14141005), tumour 
haemorrhage (Subject 15041006), and oesophageal varices haemorrhage (Subject 24031002). 
For subjects who had a CSE of haemorrhage per SMQ, the median time to first onset was 11.9 weeks in 
the lenvatinib arm and 7.2 weeks in the sorafenib arm. There are no changes to the previously reported 
safety profile of lenvatinib regarding haemorrhage. 
Hypothyroidism (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, hypothyroidism events per CMQ were observed at a higher frequency 
in the lenvatinib compared to the sorafenib arm: 21.0% (100/476) and 2.5% (12/475), respectively and 
0.32 and 0.05 episodes/SY adjusted by treatment exposure.  
Hypothyroidism was the most frequently reported PT: 78 subjects (16.4%; 0.24 episodes/SY) in the 
lenvatinib arm and 8 subjects (1.7%; 0.03 episodes/SY) in the sorafenib arm. Blood TSH increased was 
reported for 23 subjects (4.8%; 0.07 episodes/SY) in the lenvatinib and 4 subjects (0.8%; 0.02 
episodes/SY) in the sorafenib arm. The median time to first onset of hypothyroidism was 8.1 weeks in the 
lenvatinib and 13.8 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
There were no Grade ≥3 TEAEs of hypothyroidism, no SAEs, no treatment discontinuations; 1 subject in 
the lenvatinib arm had a TEAE leading to dose interruption and only 1 subject in the sorafenib arm had a 
TEAE leading to dose reduction. Overall, 66 subjects (13.9%) in the lenvatinib arm and 23 subjects 
(4.8%) in the sorafenib arm of the HCC Randomized Safety Set took at least 1 concomitant medication 
for hypothyroidism. This demonstrates that hypothyroidism could be well managed. 
By subgroup, the PT of increased blood TSH occurred at a higher incidence in subjects who were male, 
Asian, and from the Asia-Pacific region. No other meaningful subgroup differences were observed for this 
CSE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 114/151 
 
  
  
There was a higher incidence of hypothyroidism per CMQ in subjects with HCC (22.0% [0.34 episodes/SY] 
in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set) than the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (18.3%; 0.23 
episodes/SY). Many subjects in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set had thyroid cancer, 
which confounded the analysis of hypothyroidism. In subjects with an intact thyroid, the PT of 
hypothyroidism occurred at more than twice the rate compared to subjects with thyroid cancer due to a 
direct effect on the thyroid. Thyroid dysfunction is a known class effect of TKIs due to their antiangiogenic 
effect on the thyroid blood vessels. There is no change to the previously reported safety profile of 
lenvatinib regarding hypothyroidism. 
Renal Events (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, renal events per CMQ were observed at a higher frequency in the 
lenvatinib compared to the sorafenib arm: 7.1% (34/476) and 4.0% (19/475), respectively; 0.14 and 
0.08 episodes/SY, when adjusted by treatment exposure. Grade 1 and 2 events were the greatest 
contributor to the difference in the overall incidence (25 subjects [5.2%] in the lenvatinib arm and 13 
subjects [2.8%] in the sorafenib arm). Events were Grade ≥3 for 9 subjects (1.9%) in the lenvatinib and 
6 subjects (1.3%) in the sorafenib arm. 
The most frequently reported renal events in the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms, respectively were: blood 
creatinine increased (10 subjects [2.1%; 0.06 episodes/SY]; 4 [0.8%; 0.02 episodes/SY]), acute kidney 
injury (9 subjects [1.9%; 0.03 episodes/SY]; 5 [1.1%; 0.02 episodes/SY]) and renal impairment (5 
subjects [1.1%; 0.02 episodes/SY]; 6 [1.3%; 0.03 episodes/SY]). The median time to first onset was 
14.3 weeks in the lenvatinib and 10.4 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
In the HCC Randomized safety Set, 7 subjects (1.5%; 0.02 episodes/SY) reported SAEs of renal event 
per CMQ in the lenvatinib arm and 4 subjects (0.8%; 0.02 episodes/SY) in the sorafenib arm. The most 
frequently reported serious renal event was acute kidney injury (lenvatinib, 3 subjects [0.6%; <0.01 
episodes/SY]; sorafenib, 2 [0.4%; <0.01 episodes/SY]).  
There was 1 (0.2%) Grade 5 renal event in the lenvatinib arm and 2 (0.4%) in the sorafenib arm. All 3 
deaths were due to renal impairment.  
There was a low incidence of discontinuations due to renal toxicity: 2 subjects (0.4%) in the lenvatinib 
arm and 3 subjects (0.6%) in the sorafenib arm. 
Results were similar in the lenvatinib arm of the HCC Randomized Safety Set and the All HCC Lenvatinib 
Safety Set (1 additional Grade 3 event of blood creatinine increased that was not a SAE and did not result 
in treatment modification). The overall incidence of renal events per SMQ was 7.1% (0.14 episodes/SY) in 
the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set and 9.8% (0.16 episodes/SY) in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set. There are no changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib, regarding renal 
events.  
Cardiac Dysfunction (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the frequency of cardiac dysfunction events per CMQ was low in both 
the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms: 0.6% (3/476) and 0.2% (1/475), respectively (both <0.01 
episodes/SY).  Events were Grade ≥3 for 2 subjects in the lenvatinib arm (1 Grade 3, 1 Grade 
5cardiopulmonary failure) and none in the sorafenib arm. One subject (0.2%) in each arm had an SAE. 
No AEs resulted in treatment discontinuation or modification. The median time to first onset was 36.3 
weeks in the lenvatinib and 26.7 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
There were no additional cardiac events per CMQ in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set. The overall 
incidence of cardiac events per CMQ was lower in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (0.6%; <0.01 
episodes/SY) than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (4.7%; 0.06 episodes/SY). The 
potential to cause cardiac dysfunction is a known effect of lenvatinib and heart failure is noted in the

product information. There are no changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib 
regarding cardiac events. 
Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of GI perforation and fistula formation was slightly 
higher in the lenvatinib than sorafenib arm: 1.9% (9/476) and 1.1% (5/475); 0.03 and 0.02 episodes/SY 
respectively when adjusted by treatment exposure. The most frequent event was (spontaneous) bacterial 
peritonitis (6 subjects [1.3%; 0.02 episodes/SY]; 1 [0.2%; <0.01 episodes/SY]).  
Events were Grade ≥3 for 5 subjects (1.1%) in each arm. Three subjects (0.6%) in the lenvatinib and 2 
(0.4%) in the sorafenib arm had an SAE, mainly peritonitis bacterial (lenvatinib, 2 subjects [0.4%; <0.01 
episodes/SY]; sorafenib, 0). In the lenvatinib arm, 1 subject (32051003) had a Grade 5 event. One 
subject (0.2%) in the sorafenib arm discontinued due to an AE.  
The median time to onset was 32.3 weeks in the lenvatinib arm and 7.0 weeks in the sorafenib arm of 
the HCC Randomized Safety Set. 
By subgroup analysis, no events occurred in subjects who were ≥75 years of age or female. No other 
meaningful differences (difference of ≥10% or at least double) were observed in the subgroup analyses 
for this CSE. None of these differences were observed for the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set. 
There were no additional events of GI perforation and fistula formation events per SMQ in the All HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set. The overall incidence of GI perforation and fistula formation events per SMQ was 
1.8% (0.03 episodes/SY) in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set and 2.9% (0.04 episodes/SY) in the Non-
HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
There were no reports of bacterial peritonitis in the Non-HCC population; cirrhosis is a well-recognized 
risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP). 
Hypertension (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
For AEs, the severity definition also includes the use of antihypertensive medications (NCI CTCAE version 
4.03). 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, hypertension was present at Baseline in 49.8% of subjects in the 
lenvatinib and 51.4% in the sorafenib arm; 72.9% and 67.8% took concomitant antihypertensive agents.  
Hypertension events were more frequent in the lenvatinib than sorafenib arm: 44.5% (212/476) and 
30.9% (147/475), respectively; 0.83 and 0.71 episodes/SY, when adjusted by treatment exposure.  
Grade 3 hypertension events occurred in 112 subjects (23.5%) in the lenvatinib and 69 subjects (14.5%) 
in the sorafenib arm. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 hypertension events or SAEs were reported. The median 
time to first onset was 3.7 weeks in the lenvatinib and 2.1 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
One subject (0.2%) in the lenvatinib arm discontinued due to an AE. Hypertension events resulted in 
dose reduction for 16 subjects (3.4%) in the lenvatinib and 10 (2.1%) in the sorafenib arm, and dose 
interruption for 17 (3.6%) and 8 (1.7%) subjects, respectively.  
By subgroup, the overall incidence and the incidence of severe (Grade ≥3) TEAEs for this CSE, was higher 
in the oldest age group. Incidence was also higher in females.  
The overall incidence of hypertension events per SMQ was lower in subjects with HCC (46.2% [0.84 
episodes/SY] in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set) than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set (60.9%; 1.08 episodes/SY). Subjects with HCC received a lower lenvatinib starting dose (8 or 12 
mg/day) compared with the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (85% started on 24 mg QD) 
and hypertension is a known dose-related effect of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies. There are no

changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib regarding hypertension. 
Hypocalcaemia (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of hypocalcaemia events per CMQ was comparable in 
the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms: 1.1% (5/476) and 1.7% (8/475), respectively; 0.02 episodes/SY and 
0.03 episodes/SY, when adjusted by treatment exposure. Grade 3 hypocalcaemia events occurred in 2 
subjects (0.4%) in the lenvatinib and 1 subject (0.2%) in the sorafenib arm. No Grade 4 or 5 
hypocalcaemia events and no discontinuations due to AEs were reported in arm. One SAE of 
hypocalcaemia was reported in the lenvatinib arm. The median time to first onset was 31.7 weeks in the 
lenvatinib and 13.0 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
The overall incidence of hypocalcaemia events per CMQ was lower in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set 
(1.4% [0.03 episodes/SY]) than in the Non- HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (8.3%; 0.12 
episodes/SY). There are no changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib regarding 
events of hypocalcaemia.  
Palmar-plantar Erythrodysaesthesia Syndrome 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, PPE events per CMQ occurred at a lower incidence in the lenvatinib 
than sorafenib arm: 27.9% (133/476) and 52.4% (249/475), respectively. All cases were Grades ≤3; 
events were Grade 3 for 14 subjects (2.9%) in the lenvatinib and 54 subjects (11.4%) in the sorafenib 
arm. There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs in the lenvatinib arm and 3 (0.6%) subjects each 
with SAEs or discontinuations in the sorafenib arm. The median time to first onset was 5.3 weeks in the 
lenvatinib and 2.0 weeks in the sorafenib arm. 
By subgroup, the overall incidence of TEAEs for this CSE tended to be lower in the oldest subjects. The 
incidence in Asian was higher than in White subjects.  
The overall incidence of PPE was higher in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (30.0%) than the Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (20.9%). The proportion of Asian subjects was higher in the All HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.2% vs 14.2%). The 
incidence of PPE syndrome has also been observed to be higher with other TKIs in Asians compared with 
non-Asians (Ueda, et al., 2013). PPE is a known toxicity of lenvatinib and is known to occur at a higher 
incidence with sorafenib. There are no changes to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib 
regarding PPE. 
Proteinuria (Based on Adverse Event Data) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, proteinuria-SMQ events were observed at a higher frequency in the 
lenvatinib than sorafenib arm: 26.3% (125/476) and 12.2% (58/475), respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria 
occurred in 28 subjects (5.9%) in the lenvatinib and 8 subjects (1.7%) in the sorafenib arm. No Grade 4 
or Grade 5 proteinuria events were reported in either arm. Three subjects (0.6%) in the lenvatinib and 
none in the sorafenib arm reported SAEs of proteinuria. The median time to first onset was 6.1 weeks in 
the lenvatinib and 4.1 weeks in the sorafenib arm. There were few discontinuations due to proteinuria 
(0.6% [3/476] of subjects in the lenvatinib arm).  
By subgroup, the incidence of TEAEs and of severe (Grade ≥3) TEAEs for this CSE tended to be higher in 
the 2 older age groups compared with the youngest subjects and in Asian compared with White subjects.  
The overall incidence of proteinuria events per SMQ was lower in subjects with HCC (27.4% in the All HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set) than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (35.5%), again probably 
due to the lower starting dose of lenvatinib in HCC. Proteinuria is a known dose-related effect of 
VEGF/VEGFR targeted therapies. There are no changes to the previously reported safety profile of 
lenvatinib regarding proteinuria.

QT Prolongation (Reported as an Adverse Event) 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of QT prolongation events per SMQ was comparable in 
the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms: 6.9% (33/476) and 5.1% (24/475); 0.14 and 0.20 episodes/SY when 
adjusted by treatment exposure. Grade 3 QT prolongation occurred in 5 subjects (1.1%) in each arm. No 
Grade 4 or 5 QT prolongation events, SAEs or treatment discontinuations were reported in either 
treatment arm. The median time to first onset was 31.1 weeks in the lenvatinib and 14.0 weeks in the 
sorafenib arm. 
By subgroup, the overall incidence of TEAEs tended to be higher in females than in males; however, there 
were no Grade ≥3 events in females.  
The overall incidence of QT prolongation events was 6.7% (0.13 episodes/SY) in the All HCC Lenvatinib 
and 4.3% (0.07 episodes/SY) in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. There are no changes 
to the previously reported safety profile of lenvatinib regarding QT prolongation. 
Other Risks 
These were based on the company core risk management plan and regional (including the EU) risk 
management plans. These comprise: GI toxicity, hypokalaemia, pancreatitis, impaired wound healing, 
interstitial lung disease, abnormal pregnancy and excretion of lenvatinib in milk, male and female fertility, 
venous TE events, and non-GI fistula. Per the applicant there were no changes to the previously reported 
safety profile of lenvatinib regarding these risks.  
Venous Thromboembolic Events  
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the incidence of venous TE events per CMQ was higher in the 
lenvatinib than sorafenib arm: 3.8% (18/476) and 1.9% (9/475); 0.06 and 0.04 episodes /SY, adjusted 
by treatment exposure. The most frequently reported venous TE event was portal vein thrombosis: 
lenvatinib, 9 subjects (1.9%; 0.03 episodes/SY); sorafenib, 3 (0.6%; 0.01 episodes/SY). Events were 
Grade ≥3 for 10 subjects (2.1%) in the lenvatinib and 6 subjects (1.3%) in the sorafenib arm. There 
were 4 (0.8%) Grade 5 events in the lenvatinib and none in the sorafenib arm. There were 10 (2.1%) 
SAEs in the lenvatinib and 3 (0.6%) in the sorafenib arm. The median time to first onset was 7.4 weeks 
in the lenvatinib and 8.1 weeks in the sorafenib arm.  
By subgroup, the incidence of venous TE events was higher in White than in Asian subjects and in the 
Western than in the Asia-Pacific region. In the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the PT of portal vein 
thrombosis occurred at a higher incidence in Western than Asia- Pacific subjects; this difference was not 
observed for the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. In addition, in the All HCC Lenvatinib 
Safety Set, the PT of pulmonary embolism only occurred in males and at a higher incidence in White 
subjects and those from the Western region; these differences were similarly observed for the Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
The incidence of venous TE events per CMQ was 3.6% (0.06 episodes/SY) in the All HCC Lenvatinib 
Safety Set and 5.9% (0.07 episodes/SY) in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
Hemoglobin:  
In  study  304  an  increase  in  the  median  haemoglobin  concentration  from  Baseline  was  observed  in  the 
lenvatinib arm as early as day 15 and  was generally maintained throughout treatment. In the sorafenib 
arm, median hemoglobin values also increased on Day 15 but then tended to return to baseline levels or 
slightly  below  thereafter. Median  increases  from  Baseline  in  hemoglobin  values  were  consistently  higher

in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. See also the table below for the incidence of AEs of 
grade 3 and 4. TEAE anaemia (7.1% lenvatinib vs 9.1% sorafenib)  
Platelets:  
In  the  HCC  Randomized  Safety  Set,  a  decrease  from  Baseline  in  median  platelet  values  occurred  in  the 
lenvatinib  arm,  which  was  generally  maintained throughout  treatment  (57.0%  and  48.8%  of  lenvatinib- 
and sorafenib-treated subjects, respectively, experienced a worsening shift from 
Baseline  for  platelet  count  decreased,  likely  due  to  the  confounding  effect  of  chronic  liver  disease). 
Median  platelet  values  also  decreased  in  the  sorafenib  arm  and  there  were  no  consistent  differences 
between  the  2  treatment  arms  over  time.  Baseline  platelet  values  were  higher,  and  median  decreases 
from Baseline were consistently greater, in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. Overall, the 
frequency of Grade 3 and 4 events of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased was lower than the 
frequency  of  Grade  3  and  4  platelet  count  decreased  laboratory  values  but  the  incidence  of  AEs 
(laboratory values) grade 3 and 4 of count decreased was higher in the all HCC lenvatinib safety set than 
in the non-HCC safety set (see table below Table 15) 
There were no SAEs of either thrombocytopenia or platelet count decreased in either lenvatinib treatment 
arm;  SAEs  of  platelet  count  decreased  were  reported  in  2  subjects  in  the  sorafenib  arm,  one  subject 
leading to treatment discontinuation.  
White blood cells and neutrophils: 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, decreases from Baseline in median values for neutrophils and 
leukocytes occurred over time in the lenvatinib arm; these changes were consistently greater than in the 
sorafenib arm, in which values fluctuated slightly around the median baseline value throughout 
treatment. In both treatment arms, neutrophil and leukocyte values recovered to Baseline levels following 
treatment discontinuation. From Cycle 4 onwards median decreases in neutrophil and leukocyte values 
were consistently greater in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set that was otherwise similar to the HCC safety set. 
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects with least one Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline value for 
decreased WBC parameters is presented in the table below. 
During study 304, a higher percentage (at least twice) of subjects in the lenvatinib arm had a Grade 3 or 
4 postbaseline value compared with the sorafenib arm for neutrophil count decreased (7.5% vs 3.4%) 
and WBC decreased (5.8% vs 3.0%). There was no difference between treatment arms for lymphocyte 
count decreased. For WBC count decreased, and neutrophil count decreased, the incidence of Grade 3 
and 4 abnormalities was higher in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set. 
Adverse events data: In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, the following TEAEs occurred at a higher 
incidence (more than double) in the lenvatinib arm than the sorafenib arm, respectively: decreased WBC 
count (9.7% vs 4.8%), decreased neutrophil count (8.4% vs 2.3%), and neutropenia (3.8%  vs 1.5%). 
The incidence and rate of decreased lymphocyte count, leukopenia, and lymphopenia did not differ 
between treatment arms. The decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts occurred at comparable incidences 
through the entire treatment period. There were no SAEs of decreased WBC count or neutropenia and no 
discontinuations due to these AEs. There was only 1 SAE of decreased neutrophil count and 1 
discontinuation due to this event (lenvatinib arm of HCC Randomized Safety Set). There were no 
infections associated with Grade 3 or 4 events of decreased neutrophil count and thus no clinical 
consequences linked to this observation of a higher incidence of decreased WBC and neutrophil counts, 
and neutropenia in the lenvatinib arm. 
For  platelet  count  decreased,  WBC  count  decreased,  and  neutrophil  count  decreased,  the  incidence  of

ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, and GGT  
Shifts in CTCAE grade from Baseline to the worst postbaseline grade for liver parameters were presented 
and treatment-emergent laboratory results with CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 were summarized. Most changes 
were Grade 3. In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, there were Grade 3 or 4 increases in blood bilirubin 
(13.2% with lenvatinib vs 9.5% with sorafenib), ALT (7.9% vs 9.3%), AST (12.1% vs 17.9%), GGT 
(31.4% vs 37.7%), and ALP (6.6% vs 5.3%).

Application of the Hy’s Law criteria to the HCC population was considered problematic due to the 
combination of underlying cirrhosis, other aetiologies, hepatitis and HCC; therefore, evaluation of 
hepatotoxicity was performed through evaluation of reported AEs rather than laboratory criteria. 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 postbaseline values was higher in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set than in the 
Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set for AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and bilirubin, consistent with a 
diagnosis of HCC. 
Application of Hy’s Law criteria to the HCC population is problematic due to the combination of underlying 
cirrhosis, hepatitis, HCC, and other underlying aetiologies; therefore, the evaluation of hepatotoxicity is 
performed through evaluation of reported AEs rather than laboratory criteria. 
ALT and AST: Sorafenib induced a higher increase of AST values than sorafenib. Several subjects in both 
treatment arms has grade 3 ALT/AST values at Baseline. 
ALP: An increase is observed in both the lenvatinib and the sorafenib arms and results are similar in the 
Non-HCC safety set. 
GGT: Lenvatinib induced a decrease of GGT, sorafenib a slight increase while little changes were observed 
in the Non-HCC safety set. Grade 3 and 4 AEs occurred in respectively 19.6% and 0.4% for lenvatinib 
and 20.8% and 0.8% for sorafenib. 
Bilirubin: Median bilirubin values increased slightly in both arms and results are comparable with those 
observed in the Non-HCC safety set. A slightly higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin increased 
occurred with lenvatinib (13.2% vs 9.5%). 
Renal Events 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 10 subjects (2.1%) in each treatment arm had Grade 3 increases in 
creatinine, and 1 subject (0.2%) in the sorafenib arm had a Grade 4 increase. More subjects in the 
lenvatinib (n=83 [17.6%]) than the sorafenib arm (n=33 [7.0%]) had shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 
2 increases in creatinine. 
In the sorafenib arm median creatinine values decreased while no change of the median values from 
baseline were observed for the lenvatinib safety sets that were comparable to those of the Non-HCC. 
Increases in creatinine in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set were consistent with those in the lenvatinib 
arm of the HCC Randomized Safety Set and the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, although 
there were more Grade 2 increases in the HCC than the non-HCC set (17.4 vs. 13.8%). 
Hypocalcaemia  
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 2 subjects (0.8%) in the lenvatinib and no subjects in the sorafenib 
arm had a shift from Grade 0 or Grade 1 at Baseline to Grade 3 during treatment. Consistent with the AE 
data, fewer subjects had decreases in calcium from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 in the All HCC Lenvatinib 
Safety Set (0.8%) than in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (2.6%). 
Proteinuria (Based on Urinalysis) 
In  the  HCC  Randomized  safety  Set,  a  total  of  10.9%  (51/468)  of  subjects  in  the  lenvatinib  and  3.6% 
(17/470)  of  subjects  in  the  sorafenib  arm  had  a  shift  in  urine  dipstick  protein  from  a  score of  negative, 
absent,  or  trace  at  Baseline  to  +3  during  treatment.  An  additional  3.2%  (15/468)  of  subjects  in  the 
lenvatinib and 0.9% (4/470) of subjects in the sorafenib arm had a shirt to +4.  
Consistent with the AE data, more subjects in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set had shifts 
to +3 or +4 during treatment (13.5% and 5.6%, respectively) compared to the All HCC lenvatinib Safety 
Set (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively).

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 
In  the  HCC  Randomized  Safety  Set,  baseline  TSH  was  ≤  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  in  89.6%  of 
subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 90.1% in the sorafenib arm. The worst postbaseline value was >ULN in 
69.6% of subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 32.2% in the sorafenib arm. 
Thyroid-stimulating  Hormone  at  Baseline  and  Worst  Postbaseline  Value  –  HCC  Randomized,  All  HCC 
Lenvatinib, and Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets 
Echocardiogram Data 
In  the  HCC  Randomized  Safety  Set,  most  subjects  had  a  normal  LVEF  value  at  Baseline,  with  no 
postbaseline shift (lenvatinib, 98.8% [242/245]; sorafenib, 97.8% [268/274]). One subject (0.4%) in the 
lenvatinib arm had a shift from normal at Baseline to moderate dysfunction postbaseline. In the sorafenib 
arm,  2  subjects  (0.7%)  shifted  from  normal  to  mild  and  1  subject  (0.4%)  to  moderate  dysfunction 
postbaseline. The maximum decrease from Baseline in mean LVEF was -0.2% in the lenvatinib arm and -
0.5% in the sorafenib arm. No TEAEs of “ejection fraction decreased” were reported in either treatment 
arm. 
Echocardiogram data were consistent in the lenvatinib arm of the HCC Randomized Safety Set and the All 
HCC  Lenvatinib  Safety  Set.  In  the  Non-HCC  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set,  there  were  greater 
changes in LVEF. 
Blood Pressure Data 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 15.4% of subjects (72/468) in the lenvatinib and 11.0% of subjects 
(52/471)  in  the  sorafenib  arm  had  a  shift  from  Grade  0  or  Grade  1  at  Baseline  to  Grade  3  during 
treatment. Consistent with the higher incidence of hypertension reported as an AE, more subjects in the 
Non-HCC  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set  (30.8%)  had  changes  from  Grade  0  or  1  to  Grade  3 
hypertension based on vital sign data compared with subjects with HCC (16.0% in the All HCC Lenvatinib 
Safety Set). 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, increases in SBP and DBP were observed in both the lenvatinib and 
sorafenib  treatment  arms  starting  on  Cycle  1  Day  15.  For  both  arms,  the  largest  change  from  Baseline 
occurred on Cycle 2 Day 1. Both DBP and SBP appeared to stabilize by Cycle 3 or Cycle 4, probably due 
to  the  introduction  of  antihypertensive  medication(s),  dose  reduction  of  study  drug,  or  both.  The 
maximum  increase  in  median  SBP  and  DBP  did  not  exceed  +6.0  mmHg  in  either  arm.QT  Prolongation 
Based on Electrocardiogram Data 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, 37 subjects (8.1%) in the lenvatinib arm and 20 subjects (4.3%) in 
the  sorafenib  arm  had  >60  msec  increases  in  QTcF  from  baseline.  Eleven  subjects  (2.4%)  in  each 
treatment  arm  had  at  least  1  postbaseline  value  of  >500  msec  in  QTcF.  Fewer  subjects  in  the  All 
Lenvatinib  HCC  Safety  Set  compared to  the  Non-HCC  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set  had  at  least 1 
postbaseline QTcF value of >500 msec in (2.3% vs 5.7%). 
Body Weight 
In the HCC Randomized Safety Set, decreases in BW were observed in both the lenvatinib and sorafenib 
arms  starting  on  Cycle  1 Day  15.  The  maximum  decrease  from  Baseline in  median  BW  was  5.1  kg  with 
lenvatinib  (on  Cycle  21  Day  1)  and  3.5  kg  with  sorafenib  (on  Cycle  11  Day  1).  Decreases  in  BW  in  the 
lenvatinib arm were consistent with those observed in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.

Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  in  special  populations  as  described  and  key  observations  were  as 
follows: 
• 
• 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs increased with increasing age  
Females  had  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  related  TEAEs  and  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug 
dose reduction or interruption than did males.  
•  Asian and White lenvatinib-treated subjects had a similar safety profile.  
• 
• 
Lenvatinib-treated subjects from the Asia-Pacific and Western regions had a similar safety profile  
In Study 304, the overall AE profile for lenvatinib-treated subjects with baseline renal impairment 
(creatinine  clearance  <60  mL/min)  was  similar  to  those  without  renal  impairment  (creatinine 
clearance  ≥60  mL/min)  except  for  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  dose 
reduction in subjects with renal impairment.  
• 
In  Study  304,  the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs,  SAEs,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug 
discontinuation  was  higher  in  subjects  with  a  baseline  CP  score  of  6  than  of  5  in  both  the 
lenvatinib and sorafenib arms (HCC ISS Table 10.1.3). Lenvatinib-treated subjects with a baseline 
CP  score  of  6  also  had  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  modifications  (interruption, 
reduction). 
Analyses of TAES based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors (subgroups) was performed. These included:  
•  Baseline demographic characteristics (drug-demographic interactions): age; sex; geographic 
region (Asia-Pacific; Western regions) and race. 
•  Baseline disease characteristics (drug-disease interactions): Baseline ECOG PS (score 0, ≥1); 
hepatic function (CP score 5, 6); and renal function (CrCl <60, ≥60 mL/min). Analyses of baseline 
hepatic and renal function were performed for the HCC Randomized Safety Set only. 
•  Region (Western, Asia-Pacific) 
•  Starting dose (8, 12 mg) for the HCC Randomized Safety Set and region (Western, Asia-Pacific) 
If the incidence in one subgroup was ≥10% higher or, for incidences less than 10%, if the incidence in 
one subgroup was at least twice that in another subgroup, that was considered an increase. Where 
similar between subgroup trends were not observed for the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, these TEAEs 
are in italics. 
Age (<65, 65- <75, and ≥75 years) 
Most subjects were <65 years, 30% were 65- <75 years and ~ 13% were ≥75 years. The incidence of 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs was highest in the oldest age group. TEAEs leading to withdrawal of study 
drug or dose modification also increased with increasing age. The incidence of the following common 
TEAEs was highest in the oldest age group: decreased appetite, dehydration, arthralgia, asthenia, 
dizziness, dysphonia, hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, malaise, peripheral oedema, proteinuria and 
pruritus. Hepatic encephalopathy, occurred at more than twice the incidence in the oldest age group 
(17.2%) than in the other 2 age groups (7.1% in each); a similar pattern was observed for the exposure-
adjusted rate, SAEs and fatal AEs.  
Serious AEs for which the incidence was higher in the oldest age group than in 1 or both the other age 
groups in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set were (italics if a similar trend was not observed for the Non-
HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set): asthenia, hepatic encephalopathy, MI and pneumonia; similar 
results were observed for the exposure-adjusted rates except for hypoalbuminemia and malaise, which 
were also highest in the oldest age group in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
Sex 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018

Across Studies 304 and 202, most subjects were male (>5:1 ratio). There was a higher incidence of 
Grade ≥3 related TEAEs (67.1% vs. 54.8%) and of TEAEs leading to dose reduction or interruption 
(71.2% vs. 60.0%) in females than in males. No between-sex differences were observed in the exposure-
adjusted rates of episodes. 
Table 81: Overview of Exposure-adjusted Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Sex – HCC Randomized, 
All HCC Lenvatinib, and Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety Sets 
For the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the following common events occurred at a higher incidence in 
males than in females: dysphonia, increased ALT, insomnia and musculoskeletal pain. The following 
occurred at a higher incidence in females than in males: alopecia, anaemia, prolonged QT, fatigue and 
hypertension. Similar findings were observed for the exposure-adjusted episodes of events, except that 
the difference for hypertension was also observed for the Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
The incidence of SAEs of hepatic encephalopathy did not differ between males and females but the SAE of 
hepatic failure (including fatal events) only occurred in males. The SAEs of cholestatic jaundice and upper 
GI haemorrhage occurred more frequently in females than in males in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set.  
Race 
All subjects in Study 202 and most subjects in Study 304 were Asian (>2:1 ratio). There were 7 Black or 
African American subjects in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set. The primary comparison is between the 
White and Asian subjects. 
There was a higher incidence of severe (Grade ≥3) TEAEs, severe (Grade ≥3) related TEAEs and of TEAEs 
leading to study drug dose reduction in White than in Asian subjects. The incidence of fatal AEs was 
higher in White (17.2%) than in Asian subjects (11.0%) in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, although, 
this did not meet the 10% difference criterion. A similar numerical difference was not observed in the 
Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (10.1% vs 9.0%, respectively). The exposure-adjusted rates 
of episodes were numerically higher in White subjects than in Asian subjects for all categories of TEAEs.  
For the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the following common events occurred at a higher incidence in 
White than in Asian subjects: acute kidney injury, asthenia, fatigue, flatulence, hepatic encephalopathy, 
increased blood ALP, nausea, somnolence, thrombocytopenia and vomiting. The following occurred at a 
higher incidence in Asian than in White subjects: abdominal distension, alopecia, decreased neutrophil 
count, decreased platelet count, decreased WBC count, maculo-papular rash, malaise, PPE syndrome and 
proteinuria. Similar findings were observed for the exposure-adjusted episodes of events except that an 
increased AE rate of nausea and of vomiting in White subjects was observed in the Non-HCC Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set.  
For the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the following SAEs occurred at a higher incidence in White than in 
Asian subjects: abdominal pain, accidental overdose, hepatic encephalopathy, multi organ dysfunction, 
MI, pneumonia aspiration, portal vein thrombosis, seizure, umbilical hernia and urinary tract infection. 
The following occurred at a higher incidence in Asian than in White subjects: cancer pain, cholestatic 
jaundice, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, pneumonia, pyrexia, and upper GI haemorrhage.  
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 124/151 
 
  
  
 
For the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the following fatal AEs (that occurred in at least 2 subjects in a 
racial group) occurred at a higher incidence in White subjects than in Asian subjects: general physical 
health deterioration, hepatic encephalopathy, multi organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia aspiration, 
and portal vein thrombosis. The following occurred at a higher incidence in Asian subjects than in White 
subjects: respiratory failure and upper GI haemorrhage. 
Baseline ECOG PS score (0 vs. ≥1) 
The incidence of TEAEs in the 2 ECOG PS groups in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set was consistent with 
the known safety profile for lenvatinib, including a higher incidence of fatal AEs (19.2% vs. 9.2%; 0.29 
vs. 0.13 episodes/SY) and a lower incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction (30.2% vs. 
43.4%) in subjects with an ECOG PS score ≥1 than in those with a score of 0. No common TEAEs or SAEs 
occurred at a higher incidence in subjects with an ECOG PS score ≥1 than those with a score of 0. The 
incidence of SAEs of hepatic encephalopathy was higher in subjects with an ECOG PS score of 0 than in 
those with a score ≥1, whilst the fatal AE of sepsis occurred at a higher incidence in subjects with an 
ECOG PS score ≥1.  
Baseline renal function (CrCl <60 mL/min vs. ≥60 mL/min) 
In general, the incidence of overall TEAEs was similar for subjects split by baseline CrCl. There was a 
higher incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction (48.4% vs. 37.2%) in subjects with renal 
impairment (CrCl <60 mL/min).  
The following common events occurred at a higher incidence in those with lower baseline in both 
treatment groups: dehydration, dysphonia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypothyroidism, peripheral oedema, 
and proteinuria; and in the lenvatinib-treated subjects for constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, 
fatigue and vomiting.  
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was higher in the subjects with baseline CrCl <60 mL/min compared 
with CrCl ≥60 mL/min in both treatment groups for the following events: anaemia, decreased lymphocyte 
count, pneumonia and respiratory failure; and in the lenvatinib-treated subjects for cachexia, 
dehydration, dyspnoea, hyponatremia, MI, portal vein thrombosis, syncope and upper GI haemorrhage. 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the subjects with lower baseline CrCl in both treatment groups for 
pneumonia; and in the lenvatinib-treated subjects for hyponatremia, muscular weakness, MI and 
peripheral oedema. 
Baseline hepatic function 
Most subjects (>75%) had a baseline CP score of 5 (N=722), 221 subjects had a score of 6, 7 subjects 
had a score of 7 and 1 subject had a score of 8. The analysis was limited to subjects with a baseline CP 
score of 5 or 6. 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (86% vs. 71.6%), SAEs (56.1% vs. 38.8%) and TEAEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation (27.1% vs. 16.9%) was higher in subjects with a baseline CP score of 6 than of 5 in 
both the lenvatinib and sorafenib arms (% provided for lenvatinib arm). Lenvatinib-treated subjects with 
a baseline CP score of 6 also had a higher incidence of TEAEs leading to dose modifications (70.1% vs. 
59.6%). 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was higher in the subjects with baseline CP score of 6 compared with 5 
in both treatment groups for: abdominal pain, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, fatigue, general 
physical health deterioration and hyperkalaemia; and in lenvatinib-treated subjects for anaemia, 
decreased blood sodium, prolonged QT, headache, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, 
hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalaemia, increased blood bilirubin, increased blood sodium,

increased lipase, liver abscess, peripheral oedema, pneumonia aspiration, portal vein thrombosis and 
upper GI haemorrhage. 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in subjects with baseline CP score of 6 compared with 5 in both 
treatment groups for oesophageal varices haemorrhage and general physical health deterioration; and in 
the lenvatinib-treated subjects for bile duct obstruction, dyspnoea, headache, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic 
encephalopathy, hepatic failure, liver abscess, pneumonia aspiration, portal vein thrombosis, proteinuria, 
pyrexia, umbilical hernia and upper GI haemorrhage. 
Geographic Region (Asia-Pacific vs. Western) 
There were approximately twice as many subjects from the Asia-Pacific compared to the Western region 
in both HCC safety sets. There was a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (83.2% vs. 71.0%), Grade ≥3 
related TEAEs (65.8% vs. 52.3%) and TEAEs leading to dose reduction (46.5% vs. 34.9%) in subjects 
from the Western region than in those from Asia-Pacific; this trend was in the opposite direction for the 
Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
Table 82: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event Episodes Adjusted for Treatment Exposure by 
Starting dose and Region - Safety Analysis Set 
The incidence of fatal AEs was numerically higher in subjects from the West (15.5%) than from Asia-
Pacific (11.1%) in the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set; a difference was observed in the Non-HCC 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (10.3% vs 7.6%, respectively). For the exposure-adjusted rates, 
there was an increase in TEAEs leading to dose reduction interruption in subjects from the Western region 
compared with those from Asia-Pacific for the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set. 
More subjects in the Western than in the Asia-Pacific region had cirrhosis at Baseline as assessed by 
independent imaging review (81.9% vs 71.0%, respectively).  
For the All HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the following TEAEs occurred at a higher incidence in subjects from 
Asia-Pacific than from the West: abdominal distension, alopecia, decreased neutrophil count, decreased 
platelet count, decreased WBC count, PPE syndrome and proteinuria. The following TEAEs occurred at a 
higher incidence in subjects from the West: arthralgia, asthenia, hepatic encephalopathy, nausea, 
thrombocytopenia and vomiting. Similar findings were observed for the exposure-adjusted episodes. 
The following SAEs occurred at a higher incidence in subjects from Asia-Pacific than from the West: 
ascites, cancer pain, cholestatic jaundice, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, oesophageal varices 
haemorrhage, pneumonia, pyrexia, and upper GI haemorrhage. The following SAEs occurred at a higher 
incidence in subjects from the West: abdominal pain, general physical health deterioration, hepatic 
encephalopathy, hyponatremia, multi organ dysfunction syndrome, MI, nausea, pneumonia aspiration, 
portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, seizure, umbilical hernia, urinary tract infection and 
vomiting.

The following fatal AEs occurred at a higher incidence in subjects from Asia-Pacific: respiratory failure, 
sepsis and upper GI haemorrhage. The following fatal AEs occurred at a higher incidence in subjects from 
the West: general physical health deterioration, hepatic encephalopathy, multi organ dysfunction 
syndrome, pneumonia aspiration and portal vein thrombosis. 
Lenvatinib starting dose 
Starting dose was based on body weight rather than randomised; therefore, there were different numbers 
of subjects (325 for the 12-mg vs 151 for the 8-mg) and differences in demographic and baseline disease 
characteristics between the starting dose groups. A lower proportion of subjects from the Asia Pacific 
region (58.4% vs. 86.1%) and a higher proportion of males (91.4% vs. 70.2%) received the 12mg 
compared with the 8mg starting dose. Median duration of treatment was slightly longer in the 12-mg (6.3 
months) compared with the 8-mg (5.6 months) starting dose group in Study 304.  
The incidence of Grade ≥3 and of related Grade ≥3 TEAEs was higher in the 12mg than the 8mg starting 
dose group. There were no notable differences in the AE profile when adjusted by treatment duration.  
The rates (episodes/ SY) of TEAEs were assessed by starting dose and by region (Asia-Pacific and 
Western). For the Western region, the episodes of Grade ≥3 TEAEs that only occurred in the 12-mg 
starting dose group were small (≤10), except for hepatic encephalopathy (20 episodes; AE rate 0.21 
episodes/SY) and increased blood bilirubin (13 episodes; AE rate 0.14 episodes/SY). These differences 
were not observed within the Asia-Pacific region. There was a higher AE rate for hepatic encephalopathy 
in the 12-mg starting dose compared with the 8-mg starting dose (AE rates, 0.19 episodes/SY vs 0) in 
the Western region. However, there were 134 subjects in the ≥60 kg group (12 mg) compared with only 
21 subjects in the <60 kg group (8-mg) in Western region, making comparison difficult.

Post marketing experience 
Lenvatinib was first approved on 13 Feb 2015 (International Birth Date [IBD]) in the USA for the 
“treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory 
DTC.” Subsequently, lenvatinib has been approved for radiotherapy refractory-DTC in over 50 countries 
worldwide, including the EU on 28 May 2015. The RCC indication has been approved in over 30 countries 
worldwide.  Approximately 6,400 new patients have been exposed to lenvatinib from the IBD until the 
data lock date of the most recent PSUR (12 Feb 2017). The most frequently reported adverse reactions 
post-marketing are hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhoea, PPE syndrome and decreased appetite. 
Cumulatively, 2435 patients have been exposed to lenvatinib in clinical trials. Marketing exposure (new 
patients) is estimated at 2208 patients and 6367 patients cumulatively. The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions postmarketing are hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhoea, PPE syndrome and decreased 
appetite. Signals for pancreatitis and cholecystitis were evaluated in the PSUR reporting period and the 
CCDS was updated to include cholecystitis, pancreatitis, lipase increase and amylase increase in Section 
4.8, Undesirable effects. Evaluation of a signal of interstitial lung disease is ongoing. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical  safety  data  in  support  of  the  sought  new  indication  for  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  patients 
are  based  primarily  on  results  of  one  pivotal  randomised  study  (study  304).  The  starting  dose  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 130/151 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
lenvatinib  was  based  on  baseline body  weight  (BW):  12  mg  QD  for  subjects  with  a  BW  of  ≥60  kg  (325 
pts) and 8 mg QD for subjects with a BW of <60 kg (151 pts).  
The main issues identified are SAEs associated with decreased liver function due to the underlying disease 
and AEs in special populations.  
Safety findings in study 304 
The  safety  findings  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  of  study  304  were  generally  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile of lenvatinib monotherapy previously observed in DTC and described in the SmPC. 
The  majority  of  patients  exposed  to  lenvatinib  reported  adverse  events  (AEs).  The  toxicity  of  lenvatinib 
was overall manageable, by dose interruptions and dose reductions.  
The increased rate of hepatotoxicity (hepatic failure/ hepatic encephalopathy) with lenvatinib can to some 
extent  be  attributed  to  imbalances  in  baseline  risk  factors.  However  the  proportions  of  patients  with 
elevated ALT/ AST was similar in the 2 treatment arms, including at the end of therapy.  
The difference between treatment duration and time to progression in the lenvatinib arm was remarkable 
while medians for the duration of treatment and time to progression were the same in the sorafenib arm. 
This  could  be  explained  by  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  and  treatment  discontinuation.  The 
information regarding duration of treatment is provided in the SmPC. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to describe the safety profile of lenvatinib based on data from 
496 HCC patients in addition to 452 DTC patients thus allowing characterisation of common adverse drug 
reactions  in  DTC  and  HCC  patients.  The  incidences  of  the  following  ADRs  “leukopenia”,  “neutropenia”, 
“hypothyroidism”,  “blood  bilirubin  increased”,  “hypoalbuminaemia”,  “alanine  transferase  increased”  and 
“aspartate  aminotransferase  increased”  were  found  to  be increased  from  “common”  in  the  DTC  patients 
to “very common” in the HCC patients. 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  (occurring  in  ≥30%  of  patients)  are  hypertension 
(44.0%),  diarrhoea  (38.1%),  decreased  appetite  (34.9%),  fatigue  (30.6%),  and  weight  decreased 
(30.4%). 
The  most  important  serious  adverse  reactions  were  hepatic  failure  (2.8%),  hepatic  encephalopathy 
(4.6%),  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage 
(1.4%),  cerebral  haemorrhage 
(0.6%),  arterial 
thromboembolic  events  (2.0%)  including  myocardial  infarction  (0.8%),  cerebral  infarction  (0.4%)  and 
cerebrovascular  accident  (0.4%)  and  renal  failure/impairment  events  (1.4%).    There  was  a  higher 
incidence of decreased neutrophil count in patients with HCC (8.7% on lenvatinib than in other non- HCC 
tumour  types  (1.4%)),  which  was  not  associated  with  infection,  sepsis  or  bacterial  peritonitis.  No  new 
ADR was observed in study 304 
When  reviewed  by  region  and  adjusted  for  treatment  duration,  the  highest  rate  of  TEAEs,  Grade  ≥3 
TEAEs,  non-fatal  SAEs  and  fatal  AEs  appeared  to  occur  in  the  Western  region  in  lenvatinib  treated 
patients,  although  most  fatal  AEs  were  attributed  to  PD.  There  were  more  TEAEs  leading  to  dose 
reduction  in  the  West  compared  to  Asia  Pacific.  More  subjects  in  the  Western  than  in  the  Asia-Pacific 
region  had  cirrhosis  at  Baseline  as  assessed  by  independent  imaging  review  (81.9%  vs  71.0%, 
respectively) but not per CRF.  
In the Phase 3 HCC trial, hypertension (including hypertension, blood pressure increased, blood pressure 
diastolic increased and orthostatic hypertension) was reported in 44.5% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 
Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 23.5%.  The median time to onset was 26 days.  The majority of cases 
recovered following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 3.6% and 3.4% of patients 
respectively. One subject (0.2%) discontinued lenvatinib due to hypertension. 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 131/151 
 
  
  
Proteinuria was reported in 26.3% of lenvatinib-treated patients and Grade 3 reactions occurred in 5.9%.  
The median time to onset was 6.1 weeks.  The majority of cases recovered following dose interruption or 
reduction, which occurred in 6.9% and 2.5% of patients respectively.  Proteinuria led to permanent 
treatment discontinuation in 0.6% of patients. 
Renal failure/impairment event developed in 7.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients. Grade 3 or greater 
reactions occurred in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients. 
Cardiac dysfunction (including congestive cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiopulmonary failure) 
was reported in 0.6% of patients (0.4% were Grade ≥ 3) in the lenvatinib-treated group. 
There was 1 event of PRES (Grade 2) in the lenvatinib-treated group. 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial, the most commonly reported hepatotoxicity adverse reactions were 
increased blood bilirubin (14.9%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (13.7%), increased alanine 
aminotransferase (11.1%), hypoalbuminaemia (9.2%), hepatic encephalopathy (8.0%), increased 
gamma-glutamyltransferase (7.8%) and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (6.7%). The median time 
to onset of hepatotoxocity adverse reactions was 6.4 weeks.  Hepatotoxicity reactions of ≥ Grade 3 
occurred in 26.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients.  Hepatic failure (including fatal events in 12 patients) 
occurred in 3.6% of patients (all were ≥ Grade 3).  Hepatic encephalopathy (including fatal events in 4 
patients) occurred in 8.4% of patients (5.5% were ≥ Grade 3).  There were 17 (3.6%) deaths due to 
hepatotoxicity events in the lenvatinib arm and 4 (0.8%) deaths in the sorafenib arm.  Hepatotoxicity 
adverse reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 12.2% and 7.4% of lenvatinib-treated 
patients respectively, and to permanent discontinuation in 5.5%. 
Across clinical studies in which 1327 patients received lenvatinib monotherapy in indications other than 
HCC, hepatic failure (including fatal events) was reported in 4 patients (0.3%), liver injury in 2 patients 
(0.2%), acute hepatitis in 2 patients (0.2%), and hepatocellular injury in 1 patient (0.1%). 
Patients with worse hepatic impairment and/or greater liver tumour burden at baseline had a higher risk 
of developing hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure.  Hepatic encephalopathy also occurred more 
frequently in patients aged 75 years and older. Approximately half of the events of hepatic failure and 
one third of the events of the hepatic encephalopathy were reported in patients with disease progression. 
Data in HCC patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) are very limited and there are 
currently no data available in HCC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).  Since 
lenvatinib is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism, an increase in exposure in patients with moderate 
to severe hepatic impairment is expected. 
Close monitoring of the overall safety is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment.  Liver function tests should be monitored before initiation of treatment, then every 2 weeks 
for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during treatment.  Patients with HCC should be monitored 
for worsening liver function including hepatic encephalopathy (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.3% of patients treated 
with lenvatinib.  
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial, haemorrhage was reported in 24.6% of patients and 5.0% were Grade ≥ 3.  
Grade 3 reactions occurred in 3.4%, Grade 4 reactions in 0.2% and 7 patients (1.5%) had a grade 5 
reaction including cerebral haemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, intestinal haemorrhage 
and tumour haemorrhage.  The median time to first onset was 11.9 weeks.  A haemorrhage event led to 
dose interruption or reduction in 3.2% and 0.8% patients respectively and to treatment discontinuation in 
1.7% of patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 132/151 
 
  
  
Screening for and subsequent treatment of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis should be 
performed as per standard of care before starting treatment with lenvatinib. 
Hypocalcaemia was reported in 1.1% of patients, with grade 3 reactions occurring in 0.4%.  Lenvatinib 
dose interruption due to hypocalcaemia occurred in one subject (0.2%) and there were no dose 
reductions or discontinuations. 
Events of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula were reported in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients. 
QT/QTc interval prolongation was reported in 6.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients.  The incidence of QTcF 
interval prolongation of greater than 500ms was 2.4%. 
In the Phase 3 HCC trial, 89.6% of patients had a baseline TSH level of less than the upper limit of 
normal.  Elevation of TSH above the upper limit of normal was observed post baseline in 69.6% of 
lenvatinib-treated patients.  
Diarrhoea was reported in 38.7% of patients treated with lenvatinib (4.2% were Grade ≥ 3). 
Special populations 
Patients of age ≥75 years were more likely to experience hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, 
asthenia, dehydration, dizziness and hepatic encephalopathy.  Hepatic encephalopathy occurred at more 
than twice the incidence in patients aged ≥75 years (17.2%) than in those <75 years (7.1%). Hepatic 
encephalopathy tended to be associated with adverse disease characteristics at baseline or with the use 
of concomitant medications.  Arterial thromboembolic events also occurred at an increased incidence in 
this age group. 
Females had a higher incidence of hypertension, fatigue and ECG QT prolongation.  Hepatic failure events 
were observed in male patients only. 
Asian patients had a higher incidence than Caucasian patients of proteinuria, decreased neutrophil count, 
decreased platelet count, decreased white blood count and PPE syndrome, while Caucasian patients had a 
higher incidence of fatigue, hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, anxiety, asthenia, nausea, 
thrombocytopenia and vomiting. 
Patients  with  a  baseline  Child  Pugh  (CP)  score  of  6  compare  to  a  baseline  CP  score  of  5  had  a  higher 
incidence  of  decreased  appetite,  fatigue,  proteinuria,  hepatic  encephalopathy  and  hepatic  failure.  
Hepatotoxicity events and haemorrhage events also occurred at a higher incidence in CP score 6 patients 
compared to CP score 5 patients. 
Patients  with  baseline  renal  impairment  had  a  higher  incidence  of  fatigue,  hypothyroidism,  dehydration, 
diarrhoea, decreased appetite, proteinuria and hepatic encephalopathy.  These patients also had a higher 
incidence of renal reactions and arterial thromboembolic events. 
In  496  patients  with  HCC,  dose  modification  (interruption  or  reduction)  and  discontinuation  were  the 
actions  taken  for  an  adverse  reaction  in  62.3%  and  20.2%  of  patients,  respectively.    Adverse  reactions 
that most commonly led to dose modifications (in ≥5% of patients) were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, 
proteinuria,  hypertension,  fatigue,  PPE  and  platelet  count  decreased.    Adverse  reactions  that  most 
commonly  led  to  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  were  hepatic  encephalopathy,  fatigue,  blood  bilirubin 
increased, proteinuria and hepatic failure (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
A post-marketing Phase IV safety study will be performed to gather further data in the EU population (or 
relevant  Western  population)  and  to  better  characterise  safety  concern  of  hepatotoxicity  (including 
hepatic  encephalopathy)  in  real-life  conditions  and  to  accurately  collect  baseline  demographic  and 
disease-related  characteristics  for  potential  determination  of  risk  factors  contributing  to  incidence  and 
severity  of  hepatic-related  events  and  mortality.  It  is  recommended  that  both  Child-Pugh  A  and  B 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018

patients  are  included  to  mirror  expected  clinical  use.  The  MAH  will  ensure  that  a  sufficient  number  of 
patients with Child-Pugh B is studied (see RMP).  
Baseline information of importance includes: Child-Pugh score, ECOG, BCLC, Stage, previous treatments, 
extrahepatic spread/ vascular invasion, bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, encephalopathy, aetiology (HBV, 
HCV, ETOH, NASH, other), cirrhosis, weight. Child-Pugh score and performance status changes should be 
collected  during  the  study,  as  well  as  dose  modifications/discontinuations,  weight,  concomitant 
medications. 
The MAH should also discuss relevant comparisons (preferably within the study) of the lenvatinib data to 
allow an assessment of hepatic safety in an EU-population treated with lenvatinib. 
The study protocol should be submitted within 3 months of the approval of the new indication. 
PRO analyses 
Assessments of HRQoL scores were performed using the generic cancer HRQoL instrument (EORTC QLQ-
C30), the HCC-specific module (EORTC QLQ-HCC18), and the generic HRQoL instrument, EQ-5D. Patients 
were asked to complete each of the 3 questionnaires at Baseline, on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and 
at the OTV. Due to the open-label nature of the study, results should be interpreted with caution. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  incidence  and  the  severity  of  AEs  in  lenvatinib  group  are  somewhat  higher  than  the  one  observed 
with  sorafenib.  In  particular,  incidence  of  hepatic-related  serious  AEs  and  hepatic-related  deaths, 
including  lethal  hepatic  failure)  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  (n=21)  than  in  sorafenib  arm  (n=2). 
Hepatic  encephalopathy  was  4  times  more  frequent  in  lenvatinib  arm  and  remained  higher  after 
adjustment  by  duration  of  exposure  (0.17  rate  in  lenvatinib  arm,  n=55;  0.04  rate  in  sorafenib  arm, 
n=10),  mostly  due  to  cases  occurred  with  the  lenvatinib  dose  of  12mg  (0.20  rate,  n  =  45).  Given  that 
patient with better prognosis has been enrolled in the Study 304 comparing with historical trials and that 
more  vulnerable  patient  population  would  be  exposed  to  lenvatinib  in  real  life  conditions,  further 
characterisation of safety profile is needed in EU population (Western group represented 1/3 of the trial 
population).  All  the  episodes  of  hepatic  encephalopathy  with  the  dose  of  12  mg  occurred  in  Western 
population. 
Patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) have been included in the study and uncertainty 
remains as to the safety profile of lenvatinib in patients with liver impairment, who represent a significant 
proportion of patients in real life conditions. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
A non-interventional post-marketing Phase IV safety study will be performed in the EU (or Western 
population) to better characterise safety, primarily hepatotoxicity, in real-life conditions and to inform 
further on contributing factors. The study protocol will be submitted within 3 months of the approval of 
the new indication (see RMP). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC is being 
updated to add that the product can be administered as a suspension in water or apple juice. In addition, 
the labelling is updated to include the unique identifier. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 146/151 
 
  
  
 
In accordance with the EU “Guidance concerning consultations with target patient groups for the package 
leaflet; Article 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC” and 
“Guideline on the readability of the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use, 
Revision 1, 12 Jan 2009”, the changes made as part of this application are not significant in nature and 
hence do not require a user consultation. There is no change in layout, and no major change in the 
patient target group profile, nor any critical changes in terms of the safety information presented.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HCC is a cancer that usually occurs in the setting of liver cirrhosis, because of chronic infections with 
hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or diabetes 
(EASL&EORTC 2012). It is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death, and the global incidence is 
rising, with approximately 700,000 cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone (Lozano et al. 2010, Torre 
et al. 2015). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients with unresectable HCC eligible for systemic therapy, the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib 
was until recently the only treatment option. The approval was based on the results of a large Phase-3 
clinical trial (Study 100554 SHARP) conducted in 602 HCC patients (Llovet et al. 2008). The study 
demonstrated significantly increased survival under sorafenib (plus BSC) compared to placebo (plus BSC) 
(HR 0.69; p=0.0005), with a median survival rate for the sorafenib arm of 10.6 months, compared with 
7.9 months for the placebo arm. Currently, another oral multikinase inhibitor regorafenib (Stivarga) is 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who 
have been previously treated with sorafenib. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study supporting this application is Study 304 (REFLECT), a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomized, open-label phase III trial comparing lenvatinib versus sorafenib in patients with unresectable 
HCC naïve to systemic therapy. A total of 954 subjects (63.9% of screened patients) were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lenvatinib 12 mg (baseline body weight [BW] ≥60 kg) or 8 mg 
(baseline BW <60 kg) given once daily (QD) orally or sorafenib 400 mg given twice daily (BID) orally. The 
proposed dosing regimen in patients with HCC is different from that in patients with DTC (24 mg QD) and 
RCC (18mg QD in combination with everolimus 5mg QD). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Lenvatinib demonstrated non-inferiority for overall survival compared to sorafenib in the treatment of 
patients with advanced/ unresectable HCC. The final OS analysis based on 701 events (73.4% in the 
lenvatinib arm, 73.5% in the sorafenib arm) (cut-off date 13 Nov 2016) shows results within the non-
inferiority margin for hazard ratio (Lenvatinib vs. Sorafenib) of 1.08 (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.06, 
p=0.00002), with similar median OS of 13.6 months (12.1, 14.9) for lenvatinib vs 12.3 months (10.4, 
13.9) for sorafenib. The NI margin was adequately defined and the benefit with sorafenib was at least as 
good as the historical studies. The median OS results for both arms were consistent in the FAS and PPS, 
Assessment report  
EMA/582721/2018 
Page 147/151 
 
  
  
by stratification factors in the IxRS and the CRF and across most subgroups. The HR for OS was 
consistent across most subgroups analysed.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In contrast with the population included in the pivotal study, the HCC patient population treated in clinical 
practice is very heterogeneous in terms of disease burden/presence of comorbidity and includes also 
patients with ECOG PS >1, Child Pugh B and C, with significant renal impairment, with cardiovascular co-
morbidities. The MAH will conduct a post authorisation observational study to collect efficacy and safety 
data in patients in real life conditions (see RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of lenvatinib was consistent with other VEGFR targeted therapies, with its known 
safety profile and its toxicity was usually predictable and in general manageable. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs with lenvatinib were as expected for a VEGF TKI i.e. hypertension, diarrhoea, PPE, 
decreased appetite and proteinuria. These events could generally be managed with dose interruption or 
reduction, which occurred in about 60% of patients. The rate of discontinuations due to AEs was reported 
as 20.2% in the All HCC safety set and as 14.5% in the sorafenib arm. Adverse events leading to dose 
reductions, interruptions and modifications (reduction and/or interruptions) were reported respectively in 
38.7%, 52.1% and 61.8% of patients in lenvatinib arm and in 38.9%, 40.6% and 55.6% of patients in 
the sorafenib arm.  
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, SAEs and fatal AEs occurred at higher frequency in the lenvatinib (56.7%) than 
sorafenib (48.6%) arm. The incidence of Grade 5 adverse events was higher for lenvatinib, particularly 
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic failure, sepsis and cerebral haemorrhage.   
The incidence of AEs in the all HCC lenvatinib monotherapy safety set was usually lower than in the non-
HCC safety set, except for ascites (14.3%), platelet count decreased (18.1%), ALT (11.1%), ASP 
(13.7%) and bilirubin (14.3%) increased and Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE) (29%).  
Hepatic related AEs including hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure (both with lethal cases) were 
also observed at a higher rate in this population of subjects with advanced HCC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) have been included in the study and uncertainty 
remains as to the safety profile of lenvatinib in patients with liver impairment, who represent a significant 
proportion of patients in real life conditions. A post authorisation observational study will be conducted to 
address this uncertainty (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Low numbers and 
patients' underlying 
condition result in 
uncertainties 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable for surgery, is a highly invalidating and life 
threatening condition with an overall poor prognosis. Currently there are two systematic therapy options

registered in Europe for this patient population, namely sorafenib approved initially for palliative systemic 
treatment regardless of the line of therapy and regorafenib, recently approved as second-line therapy 
after prior sorafenib.  
Lenvatinib demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of HCC and was non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of 
overall survival. On subgroup analysis, the OS trend favoured sorafenib in the Western region. This may 
be due to different aetiologies for HCC in the West, with more alcohol and less hepatitis C induced 
cirrhosis, leading to an increased propensity to develop hepatic encephalopathy.  
In some patients, underlying liver function maybe too poor to tolerate treatment with lenvatinib and, 
despite observed efficacy, subsequent liver damage negatively affects prognosis. The risk of hepatic 
failure/ encephalopathy should be further analysed in real-life setting given that lenvatinib will be also 
used in more vulnerable non-selected population. Due to inclusion criteria used in the pivotal study, more 
homogenous patient population with better prognosis has been enrolled. Therefore, uncertainties remain 
as to efficacy and safety in more heterogeneous and less fit patient population in real life conditions.  
Data in EU population (or relevant Western population) were obtained in one third of patients enrolled in 
the study. Only patients with well-preserved liver function have been included and more data needs to be 
collected in a real-life setting. An observational clinical trial (PASS category 3 study in the RMP) aims to 
further characterise safety (mainly hepatic-related events) and to collect OS data. Accurate reporting of 
baseline disease-related, other baseline characteristics and AEs in this study would allow further 
correlative analysis of risk factor for hepatic-related toxicity. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although patients with advanced-stage HCC and intermediate-stage who progress after locoregional 
therapy are currently treated with sorafenib, lenvatinib is considered as a possible treatment option based 
on the results of the Study 304. Non-inferiority in terms of OS is supported by results of surrogate 
endpoints (PFS, TTP, ORR). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lenvima as monotherapy is positive for the treatment of adult patients with advanced 
or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have received no prior systemic therapy (see Section 5.1)’.

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systemic therapy; consequently, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated and the package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC is being updated to add that the product can be administered as a 
suspension in water or apple juice. In addition, the labelling is updated to include the unique identifier. 
The RMP was updated (version 10.6). The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

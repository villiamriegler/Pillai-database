1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 2 November 2017 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kymriah, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Kymriah was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1266 on 29 April 2014 in the 
following condition: Treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma, and EU/3/16/1745 on 14 
October 2016 in the following condition: Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
Kymriah was granted eligibility to PRIME on 23 June 2016 in the following indication: Treatment of 
paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
  Despite significant advances in treatment, approximately 15% to 20% of patients with ALL will 
suffer relapsed disease, the most common cause of treatment failure. Available treatments in 
paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL after at least 2 prior therapeutic regimens show 
overall remission rate in 20% of patients. The unmet medical need in relapsed or refractory (r/r) 
paediatric ALL patients was agreed. 
 
The applicant has presented evidence from Study CCTL019B2202 showing initial high remission 
rates (82%) in paediatric r/r B-cell ALL patients at 28 Day assessment, accompanied with MRD 
negativity, with individual data from several patients showing duration of the responses over 4 
months.  
  Although preliminary, these results are further supported by a similar study conducted in the US 
and compare favourably with historical controls. In conclusion, the evidence presented support the 
product’s potential to significantly address the unmet medical need in paediatric patients with 
relapsed or refractory ALL. 
  Although the product is at an advanced stage of development, it is considered that there are 
benefits of supporting the development in preparation for an accelerated assessment (e.g. on long-
term follow-up, manufacturing aspects). 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of: 
 
Paediatric and young adult patients aged 3 to 25 years with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are 
ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Kymriah as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018

ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that tisagenlecleucel was to be considered a new active substance. 
The application submission is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0270/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0270/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products for the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia indication. 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products for the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma indication because there is 
no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance tisagenlecleucel contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, the Rapporteur was appointed by the CHMP. 
A kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with EMA, Rapporteur, assessors team and experts 
from relevant scientific committees. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development 
programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the 
following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures: comparability between manufacturing 
sites and processes, risk minimisation plan, including plans for registry to collect long term safety data, 
regulatory strategy and paediatric investigation plan.

Treatment of paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 
The majority of ALL malignancies are of B-cell origin, and although ALL can occur at any age, it has a 
bimodal incidence. It is more commonly seen in children with approximately 60% of the cases 
occurring in patients aged younger than 20 years, with a peak incidence between 2 to 5 years and with 
the incidence rising again after the age of 60 years. ALL is a rare disease. The incidence rate of 
paediatric ALL is 3.5/100000 in the United States (US) and 2.9/100000 in the European Union (EU). 
About 3000 children in the US and 5000 children in the EU are diagnosed with ALL. Most cases of ALL 
occur due to an unknown reason. There are a number of known genetic risk factors including Down 
syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Li-Faumeni syndrome, Fanconi anaemia and constitutional mismatch 
repair deficiency. Environment risk factors may include radiation exposure and prior chemotherapy. 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
DLBCL is the most common type of NHL, accounting for 30–40% of all cases. DLBCL accounts for 
approximately 31% of all NHLs in Western countries and 37% of B-cell tumours worldwide. The median 
age at presentation is 70 years old; however, it can occur at any age, with a slightly higher incidence 
in men. The incidence rate of DLBCL was 3.44/100000 in the European Union (EU) in 2014 [1]. The 
probability of having DLBCL increases with age, from 0.13% and 0.09% before the age of 29 to 1.77% 
and 1.4% after the age of 70 in men and women, respectively [2]. For the vast majority of patients, 
the aetiology of DLBCL is unknown. Factors thought to potentially confer increased risk include 
immunosuppression (including AIDS, and iatrogenic aetiologies in the setting of transplantation or 
autoimmune diseases), ultraviolet radiation, pesticides, hair dyes, and diet. A subset of diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma, including immunoblastic and primary CNS disease is highly associated with the EBV 
virus, although unlike certain indolent histologies, the concept of antigen-driven lymphomagenesis is 
less developed in DLBCL. 
B-cell malignancies represent a heterogeneous group of lympho-hematopoietic malignancies including 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and most non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL). NHLs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018

are classified according to the current WHO classification into immature lymphoid neoplasms, mature 
B-cell neoplasms, T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [3]. 
Mature B-cell lymphomas are further clinically classified into indolent lymphomas and aggressive 
lymphomas. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
Most cases occur due to an unknown reason. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome. 
Environment risk factors may include significant radiation exposure or prior chemotherapy. The 
underlying mechanism involves multiple genetic mutations that results in rapid cell division. The 
excessive immature lymphocytes in the bone marrow interfere with the production of new red blood 
cells, white blood cells and platelets. 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
DLBCL is a heterogeneous disease with several subtypes identified, each subtype having different 
clinical presentations and prognosis. These subtypes can be differentiated based on the location of 
tumour, cell of origin and molecular profiling (e.g. germinal B-cell center (GBC)-like, activated B-cell 
(ABC)-like, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma) [4]; [5]. However, the majority of DLBCL 
cases do not conform to any of these subtypes, and are classified as DLBCL, not otherwise specified 
(DLBCL, NOS). The WHO classification system describes many subtypes based on location of the 
tumour, the presence of other cells (such as T cells) within the tumour and whether the patient has 
other illnesses related to DLBCL. 
The causes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not well understood. For the vast majority of patients, 
the aetiology of DLBCL is unknown, although, immunosuppression (including iatrogenic aetiologies) 
and the exposure to significant radiation or certain chemicals (pesticides, hair dyes) have been 
associated with a potentially increased risk. Usually DLBCL arises from normal mature B-cells at 
different stages of differentiation, although it can also represent a malignant transformation of other 
types of lymphoma or leukaemia. Multiple molecular pathways of B-cell proliferation and differentiation 
may result in the activation of oncogenes (i.e. BCL2, BCL6, and MYC) and the inactivation of tumour 
suppressor genes (i.e. p53 and INK4), as well as other important transcription factors such as OCT-1 
and OCT-2. Cell surface protein CD19 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and a 
component of a cell surface signal transduction complex that regulates signal transduction through the 
B - cell receptor (Ledbetter et al 1988, Stamenkovic and Seed 1988, Fearon and Carroll 2000). CD19 is 
a promising target antigen for B-cell malignancies, as the protein is expressed by B-cells and their 
([6]; [7]; [8])precursors, but not pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells [9], and it is expressed in most 
B-cell neoplasms [10]. It is not present on most normal tissues, other than normal B-cells [11], which 
makes CD19 a relatively safe target. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin colour, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph 
nodes and bone pain.  
Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests and bone marrow examination. Some clinicians continue to 
use the French-American-British (FAB) system to classify ALL by the histological appearance of tumour 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 13 
 
 
 
 
 
cells. In 2008, WHO introduced a system of classification based on cytogenetic and molecular 
diagnostic tests to help determine prognosis and the most appropriate treatment for each specific case 
of ALL. 
If untreated, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months. With current 
management strategies that include risk-directed therapies, survival for children has increased from 
under 10% in the 1960s to over 80% in the present day. Survival rates remain lower for babies (about 
50%) and adults (about 35%). 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
The clinical manifestations of DLBCL are variable and depend on the site of disease involvement. 
Rapidly growing tumours may present as masses, causing symptoms when they infiltrate tissues or 
organs. Pain may occur due to rapid or invasive tumour growth, and is often the first sign of this 
illness, sometimes associated with “B-symptoms” of fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. 
Generalized pruritus may also be present. The diagnosis of DLBCL should be carried out in a reference 
haematopathology laboratory with expertise in morphological interpretation and the facilities to carry 
out the full range of phenotypic and molecular investigations. A surgical excision biopsy remains the 
optimal method of diagnosis. A morphological diagnosis of DLBCL should be confirmed in all cases by 
immunophenotypic investigations, either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry or a 
combination of both techniques. 
DLBCL shows an aggressive behaviour and in untreated patients the median survival is less than one 
year. About half of the patients respond to current treatment with an overall 5-year survival of about 
60%. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
For r/r ALL treatment options include high-dose chemotherapy with subsequent allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT), standard chemo-immunotherapy, targeted treatment with small molecule 
pathway inhibitors, or supportive care with non-curative palliative goals. Allogeneic SCT is the only 
potentially curative option for r/r pALL, but outcomes are suboptimal. Among r/r pALL patients who 
received allogeneic SCT in third or later remission, received allogeneic SCT with active disease or 
received allogeneic SCT after relapse from previous allogeneic SCT, the 1-year overall survival (OS) 
rates are in 25 to 55% range and 5-year OS rates are generally in 20 to 45% range. 
For Ph+ patients, dasatinib (Sprycel) was approved in 2006 for the treatment of adult patients with 
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib (Iclusig) was approved in 2013 for the treatment 
of adult patients with Ph+ ALL who are resistant to/ intolerant of dasatinib. Blincyto (blinatumomab), a 
bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the treatment of adults with Ph- 
relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL.  
Despite the current treatment modalities, maintaining a remission in relapsed patients is difficult, the 
patients are being hospitalized for a long periods of time with a poor QoL, and the prognosis of patients 
with r/r disease still remains poor. 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
The front-line standard of care for patients with DLBCL includes a combination of CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone) with rituximab (R -CHOP). The addition 
of rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, to first-line chemotherapy has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 14 
 
 
 
 
 
improved the outcome of patients with DLBCL resulting in a survival rate of about 75% at 6 years [12]. 
However, 30-50% of the patients do not have long-term benefit from first-line therapy (approximately 
30% relapse and 20% have refractory disease) [13]. 
For patients who are deemed eligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant 
(HD-ASCT) based on adequate performance status (defined by age and absence of major organ 
dysfunctions), clinical treatment guidelines for r/r DLBCL patients recommend salvage therapy with 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (i.e. R-DHAP, R-ICE, R-GDP) followed by HD-ASCT. However, 
about half of patients r/r to first-line therapy are not eligible for ASCT because of advanced age and/or 
comorbidities. Furthermore, among patients suitable for HD-ASCT, only about half will have a response 
to salvage therapy that is sufficient to be able to proceed to HD-ASCT [14], [15]. In addition, of those 
proceeding to HD-ASCT, 60% of patients will relapse after transplant. Clinical studies, palliative 
chemotherapy, and in rare cases a second HD-ASCT or allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) are 
some of the options available for these patients [16]. 
Options for patients with DLBCL are presented in the following diagram: 
Figure 1 Role of ASCT in r/r DLBCL 
Overall, prognosis in patients who are refractory or who have relapsed is poor. There is, therefore, an 
unmet medical need. 
About the product 
Tisagenlecleucel was applied for the treatment of: 
 
 
Paediatric and young adult patients aged 3 to 25 years with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are 
ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. 
In response to the comments made by CAT on the List of Questions (16/03/2018), the applicant 
submitted in its responses of 25/04/2018 a revised SmPC with the broader indication with regard the 
Assessment report

paediatric population (see discussion on clinical efficacy).Following the assessment the indication was 
agreed as for the treatment of: 
 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post transplant or in second or later relapse. 
•  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy. 
Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous, immunocellular cancer therapy which involves reprogramming a 
patient’s own T cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to identify and 
eliminate CD19 expressing cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single chain antibody fragment 
which recognises CD19 and is fused to intracellular signalling domains from 4 1BB (CD137) and CD3 
zeta. The CD3 zeta component is critical for initiating T cell activation and antitumour activity, while 4 
1BB enhances the expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon binding to CD19 expressing 
cells, the CAR transmits a signal promoting T cell expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel (SmPC, 
section 5.1). 
The recommended dosage in paediatric and young adult B cell ALL patients are as follows: 
- 
- 
For patients 50 kg and below: 0.2 to 5.0 x 10 P
6
P CAR positive viable T cells/kg body weight. 
For patients above 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 10P
8
P CAR positive viable T cells (non weight based). 
The recommended dosage in adult DLBCL patients is 0.6 to 6.0 x 10 P
8
P CAR positive viable T cells (non 
weight based) (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following: 
For paediatric and young adult patients aged 3 to 25 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), it can be agreed that the apparent improved overall survival 
constitutes a major interest from the point of view of public health in a disease with a poor prognosis 
with current therapies.  
In addition, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse DLBCL who are ineligible for autologous 
stem cell transplant, the apparent improved overall response rate would constitute a major interest 
from the point of view of public health in a disease with an extremely poor prognosis with current 
therapies.  
For both indications the use of targeted cell therapy is considered to be a major therapeutic innovation. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, since major objections had been identified, which precluded an accelerated 
assessment.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Kymriah (INN: tisagenlecleucel, product code CTL019) is a gene therapy product which contains 
autologous genetically modified T cells. The product is manufactured from the patient’s own T cells, 
which are transduced with a lentiviral vector that encodes a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed 
against human CD19. This allows these T cells to specifically target and destroy CD19-positive B cells 
in an antigen dependent, but major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent manner. 
The finished product is presented as dispersion for infusion. The quantitative information regarding 
CAR-positive viable T cells/mL and total cells in the product is presented in the labelling for each 
patient-specific batch. The concentration is dependent on indication and patient body weight. 
For treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL): 
Body weight ≤50 kg: 1-3 bags contain a total of 0.2 to 5 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body 
weight. 
Body weight >50 kg: 1-3 bags contain a total of 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
For treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): 
1-3 bags contain a total of 0.6 to 6 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Other ingredients are: glucose, sodium chloride, human albumin solution, dextran 40 for injection, 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, magnesium 
chloride, sodium-N-acetyltryptophanate, sodium caprylate, aluminium and water for injections. 
The finished product is supplied in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) infusion bag(s) with polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) tubing and a luer spike interconnector closed by a luer-lock cap containing either 10–30 mL 
(50 mL bags) or 30–50 mL (250 mL bags) cell dispersion.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the gene therapy viral 
vector and part 2 for the transduced cells. 
General Information (viral vector) 
The CTL019 (murine) HIV-1 vector is a replication-defective, recombinant third-generation self-
inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector derived from the HIV-1 lentiviral genome. It encodes a CAR against 
human CD19 expressed under the control of the human elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoter, see 
Figure 2. 
The CAR transgene is comprised of an extracellular murine single chain antibody fragment (anti-
CD19scFv) linked via a human CD8 hinge and transmembrane region to an intracellular signalling 
chain consisting of human 4-1BB and CD3ζ. 
The majority (approximately 85%) of the native HIV-1 sequence has been removed to produce a 
replication-defective lentiviral vector system. The vector system is comprised of four plasmid 
constructs;

Genetic structure of the integrated vector 
Biological activity of the vector is controlled for batch release by measuring the transduction efficiency 
corresponding to a measurement of the infectivity of the vector. The result is expressed in transducing 
units (TU) per mL. In addition, transgene expression is characterized for each vector batch. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (viral vector) 
The CTL019 vector is manufactured under contract by Oxford BioMedica, Oxford, UK (OXB) using an 
upstream process (consisting of thawing of the working cell bank (WCB), expansion of the production 
cell bank, plasmid transfection, induction and harvest), followed by a downstream purification process 
(consisting of filtration, chromatography and nuclease treatment steps)  to yield the ‘vector substance’ 
(purified bulk vector).  The vector substance undergoes sterile filtration, concentration and filling to 
obtain the vector product. 
Overall, a sufficient level of detail for the manufacturing process has been provided, including cell 
density, culture conditions, media description and in-process controls (IPCs).  
The purification process is also described satisfactorily. Process intermediates are identified and hold 
times and conditions are given. All buffer preparations and storage are described. 
Data presented, including process characterisation, validation and batch release data, demonstrate 
consistency in production of the vector substance and vector product and as such, the presented 
approach is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials (viral vector) 
The raw materials are in general sufficiently documented with certificates of analysis and specifications 
with acceptance criteria provided in the dossier. Raw materials of biological origin used during 
manufacture of the viral vector are sufficiently documented with certificates of suitability. Porcine 
trypsin and the recombinant alternative are sufficiently documented regarding viral safety and are in 
accordance with TSE guidelines.  
Generation of the starting plasmids is fully described, including full listing of all genetic elements. 
Manufacture of the plasmid is based on a bacterial cell banking system and plasmids are extensively 
release tested. The origin and preparation of the cell banks has been set out in sufficient detail. The 
Applicant includes a discussion on the tumorigenic risk of the cell line. The assessment of low 
tumorigenicity risk of the vector cell substrate is acceptable.

The Applicant has presented sufficient information on the qualification of the current Master Cell Bank 
(MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB), including a comprehensive adventitious agent testing 
programme in accordance with ICH Q5A (R1), covering relevant human, porcine and bovine viruses. 
The Applicant is in the process of converting the current WCB 1390.01 into a new MCB as stocks are 
running low. A suitable testing profile for the additional characterisation of this cell bank has been 
provided.  
Process validation (viral vector) 
The Applicant has presented a brief overview of the risk assessment approach and process 
characterisation studies that were undertaken. The results are presented in the form of overview tables 
summarising the characterisation range, Normal Operating Ranges (NORs), Proven Acceptable Ranges 
(PARs), criticality designation, as well as a brief justification. In general, the process characterisation is 
considered acceptable. The Applicant has demonstrated that the NORs largely operate within clinically 
proven limits and the PARs are generally justified.  
The Applicant has set out the process validation for both vector substance manufacturing sites and the 
two vector filling sites. Different lots of raw materials were used for the different campaigns. 
Validation data for the vector substance lots consisted of KPP and CPP data, incubation, holding and 
process times and IPC, In-Process Monitoring (IPM) and some characterisation results. Data show that 
the process is well controlled and can be consistently carried out at both sites. 
Aseptic process validation is performed at the filling sites.  
Vector substance shipping qualification is sufficiently documented. 
Manufacturing process development (viral vector) 
The changes introduced to the plasmid by OXB are all designed to increase the safety of the vector and 
are as such endorsed and generally considered conservative. A comparability exercise on healthy 
donor T cells was conducted versus an earlier version of the plasmid and an overview has been 
provided. Importantly, the OXB vector has undergone clinical qualification. Sufficient comparability is 
shown.  
Two comparability exercises were conducted, one for the introduction of the second vector substance 
manufacturing site and one for the introduction of the second vector product manufacturing site.  
For the manufacture of the vector product a complete side-by-side evaluation of any difference in the 
facility and equipment is presented together with and evaluation of the potential impact. Differences 
observed are minor and considered acceptable. 
Characterisation (viral vector) 
Studies to confirm the structure and characteristics are brief. The most important features such as the 
viral infectious titre and the integrity of the RNA insert as well as control of impurities have however 
been sufficiently investigated. 
The vector proteome analysis and identification were performed. 
The particle number was determined.  
Biological activity has been satisfactorily analysed, including analysis of CAR expressing cells. 
Investigation into the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and transduction efficiency have been performed.

The investigation of impurities focuses on process related impurities. For product related impurities, 
replication competent lentivirus (RCL) has been investigated, with satisfactory information presented.  
Process related impurities are identified and are generally considered adequately characterised.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure (viral vector) 
The specifications for the vector substance and vector product include identity, quantity, biological 
activity, purity and impurities, bacterial endotoxins, bioburden, sterility and adventitious agents’ tests.  
The presented panel of specifications for the vector substance and vector product is in general 
considered acceptable. RCL testing is performed in line with Ph. Eur. 5.14. The validation of the applied 
methods are adequately performed and documented in the dossier.  
Analytical procedures (viral vector) 
The analytical methods have been described and validation summaries and validation reports were 
presented for all analytical assays.  
Reference standard (viral vector) 
The Applicant has included a list of all reference materials including commercially available standards 
and positive controls that are included in assay kits. This list includes the origin of the reference 
preparation and acceptance criteria. 
Details regarding reference standard specification and qualification were provided for the viral vector 
reference standard. This includes a description of the manufacture of the standard as well as 
characterisation in respect of the assays to be used. A stability testing programme is also provided and 
is acceptable.  
Batch analysis (viral vector) 
Batch analytical data for all vector substance and product batches are provided. This includes vector 
substance and vector product batches which were used in clinical trials, stability studies, process 
validation, comparability studies, and for specification setting. Representative certificates of analysis 
are provided.  
Container closure (viral vector) 
The primary packaging for the vector product consists of clear  type I glass vials with a grey 
fluorocarbon layer coated chlorinated bromobutyl rubber stopper. The rubber stopper is sealed with an 
aluminium flip tear-up seal.  
The Applicant has provided a description of the container closure systems for the vector substance and 
vector product. Both comply with Ph. Eur. requirements where applicable. Specifications and 
acceptance criteria are provided.  
Stability (viral vector) 
The Applicant has requested a shelf-life for the vector substance of 12 months at -60°C to -90°C and 
has provided primary and supportive real-time stability data to support this. The proposed shelf-life for 
the vector substance is acceptable.

A shelf-life of 36 months at -60°C to -90°C is requested for the vector product. Primary real-time and 
supportive stability data were provided to support the proposed shelf life.  Based on the data provided, 
the proposed shelf-life for the vector product is acceptable. 
Active substance part 2 (transduced cells CTL019) 
General information (transduced cells CTL019) 
The CAR-19 protein is comprised of a murine single chain antibody fragment (anti-CD19scFv), a CD8 
hinge and transmembrane region, a 4-1BB (CD137) and a CD3ζ signalling domain (See Figure 3). 
CTL019 targets cells expressing CD19. CD19 is expressed on B cells from early development until 
differentiation into plasma cells but is not present on pluripotent blood stem cells.  
The generation of a robust and sustained anti-tumour immune response requires triggering of cytokine 
production, cytotoxicity, and T cell proliferation. Chimeric receptors bearing CD3ζ (CD3-zeta) signalling 
modules are sufficient to trigger T cell activation and proliferation but are not sufficient to drive robust 
in vivo expansion and persistence of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells). Addition of the 
intracellular transduction domain of CD137 (4-1BB), enhances T cell activation compared to 
lymphocytes expressing equivalent receptors lacking 4-1BB. In preclinical models, inclusion of the 
CD137 (4-1BB) signalling domain significantly increased antitumor activity at low effector: target 
ratios, and in vivo persistence of chimeric antigen receptors as compared with inclusion of the CD3ζ 
signalling domain alone. 
CTL019, like other CAR T cells, can work through multiple mechanisms of action. In response to CD19 
expressing cells, CTL019 can proliferate, secrete cytokines, efficiently kill cells expressing the CD19 
antigen, and persist long term in vivo.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (transduced cells 
CTL019) 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls (transduced cells CTL019) 
CTL019 will be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices at the Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 220 East Hanover Avenue, Morris Plains (MP) facility in US and at the 
Fraunhofer Institut für Zelltherapie und Immunologie (FH IZI) in Perlickstraße 1, 04103 Leipzig, in 
Germany. Novartis Pharma GmbH in Roonstraße 21-25, DE-90429 Nürnberg in Germany is responsible 
for batch certification. 
The manufacture of CTL019 starts with the acceptance and thawing of the leukapheresis material and 
ends with the cryopreservation of the CAR-positive T-cell containing product. Washed leukapheresis 
cells are enriched and are then transduced with the vector. After static incubation, the cells are 
eventually expanded in a bioreactor. At the end of the culture period the cells are washed and 
cryopreserved. The microbial control strategy has been adequately described.  
The Applicant has explained the steps in sufficient detail and has provided CPPs and KPPs in a tabular 
format for each step. Flow diagrams setting out in process controls are provided. Compositions of cell 
culture media and solutions are provided and processing times are defined.  
The batch definition and numbering system has been suitably explained.  
Control of materials (transduced cells CTL019) 
The control of the vector is described in detail in part 1 above. 
Materials that are chemically defined and materials of animal, human or recombinant origin 
The Applicant has given a general overview of the principles of material control for the manufacture of 
CTL019. Materials used for the leukapheresis material that are chemically defined and materials of 
biological origin as well as their specifications are listed and certificates of analysis provided. The 
components are either compendial or tested according to the Applicant’s internal specifications. 
Product contact consumables and compositions of the cell culture media are also listed. A material 
qualification and control program is in place and standard operating procedures are used to assess 
both suppliers and materials. Suppliers are assessed for quality criteria including adherence to cGMP 
regulations. At a minimum, an identity test and a check for compliance of the vendor certificate of 
analysis are conducted on all components in accordance with Ph. Eur. 5.2.12 and ICH Q7.  
Leukapheresis material  
The collection and initial processing of the leukapheresis material is adequately described. Infectious 
disease testing of the donor will be performed as part of the patient leukapheresis eligibility process 
according to Annex IV of Directive 2002/98/EC and any local additional testing requirements for 
tissues and cell donors. The processing of cells for further manufacturing is performed in line with 
Directive 2004/23/EC. 
A full list of apheresis sites used during clinical development in both the pALL and the DLBCL study has 
been provided. The process for selection approval and implementation as well as oversight of new 
apheresis sites has been described. Sites are required to be licensed under 2004/23/EC as well as

having JACIE accreditation and implemented ISBT-128 labelling standards. Implementation of a new 
apheresis site requires an assessment by the Applicant.  
Batch analysis data from the collected batches for pALL and DLBCL are presented and demonstrate the 
variability of the starting material in terms of cellular composition.  
A thorough characterisation of the key attributes of leukapheresis material has been undertaken and 
adequate specifications have been set. 
Description of packaging and cryopreservation of the patient leukapheresis material and a brief 
overview of the stability studies has been provided. This consisted of a study to determine stability for 
storage before cryopreservation, as well as a real-time storage conditions study, i.e. after 
cryopreservation.  
Process validation (CTL019) 
The Applicant has provided an overview of the process validation approach. This included a summary 
of the process characterisation that formed the basis of the setting of process parameters, in addition 
to PARs and NORs. The Applicant has undertaken a process risk assessment to identify high-risk 
parameters followed by a process capability analysis of clinical batches manufactured so far to 
designate high-risk parameters as key or critical. Lastly, PARs and NORs were set based on previous 
manufacturing experience. 
The Applicant produced several process validation batches covering both manufacturing sites and both 
patient and healthy donor material. Batches were deliberately chosen to display a variety of starting 
material compositions, in particular varying B-cell content. The approach taken for the starting 
material selection and the number of batches used are endorsed. 
The Applicant has provided data on processing times for individual culturing steps, results for CPPs and 
IPCs, information on yield and Population Doubling Levels (cPDLs). Based on the data provided, the 
process appears overall consistent.  
Aseptic process validation was conducted at both MP and FH IZI. Results were satisfactory. Adequate 
results from shipping validation studies have also been provided. 
The Applicant has presented a continuous process verification (CPV) plan that outlines monitoring 
activities planned for the future. The explanation of the CPV approach has been provided and is 
acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development (CTL019) 
The Applicant has given an overview of the process development for CTL019, covering several process 
versions. The most significant changes are associated with the various options introduced for starting 
material processing and a transfer of the process from the initial manufacturing site to MP. 
Overall, quality data indicate that the changes had no major impact on product composition and 
comparability. The Applicant has demonstrated the comparability of the product manufactured at MP 
and FH IZI sufficiently on the basis of in-process controls, release testing results and additional 
characterisation.  
Characterisation (CTL019) 
The Applicant has used a range of analytical methodologies to analyse the cell composition of the 
product, CAR expression and functionality.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 23 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall cell populations present in CTL019 are sufficiently characterised, and consist mainly of T 
cells with a minimum percentage of T cells being required. Occasionally some NK cells are detected but 
the eventual presence of NK cells in the finished product is considered sufficiently justified. All other 
cell populations are below the limit of detection. The proportion of CAR positive viable cells in the 
population is variable. An acceptable specification limit has been set. The quantitative information 
regarding CAR-positive viable T cells/mL and total cells in the product is presented in the batch-specific 
documentation accompanying Kymriah.  
T-cell subsets were also adequately described, starting with the CD4:CD8 ratio, and including naïve T 
cells, central memory and memory effector cells. Immunosenescence was also investigated 
satisfactorily. 
The Applicant has performed deep single cell phenotyping to obtain more in depth data on the 
proteome and activation status of the cells. Results complement the information obtained regarding 
activation status of the cells.  
Overall, the Applicant has obtained a good picture of relevant characteristics of the finished product in 
terms of cellular composition and effector function.  
On a molecular level, an integration site analysis has been performed. A verification that the constructs 
are of full length is provided. 
The Applicant has generally discussed the relevant cell-based impurities sufficiently and has also 
included some discussion on the controls required where applicable. Overall, the rationale and control 
mechanisms are accepted. 
Residual B cells are consistently below the level of detection by flow cytometry and the Applicant 
discussed the theoretical risk associated with CAR transduced B cells, which is considered low.  
Generation of a RCL following infusion of the T cells transduced by the lentiviral vector remains a 
theoretical possibility, albeit with a low probability since multiple recombination events would be 
necessary to generate a RCL. For all CTL019 batches manufactured during clinical development, the 
release testing results for RCL were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) which confirms that no 
homologous recombination has occurred with VSV-G to generate VSV-G pseudotyped RCL.  
A list of potential cell culture related impurities is given. The justification provided for the satisfactory 
removal of these is overall accepted.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure (CTL019) 
As the manufacture of CTL019 is a continuous process, the relevant data are discussed in the finished 
product section. 
Stability (CTL019)

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The concentration of CAR-positive viable T cells is dependent on indication and patient body weight.  
The cellular composition and the final cell number vary between individual patient batches. In addition 
to T cells, NK cells may be present. The quantitative information regarding CAR-positive viable T 
cells/mL and total cells in the product is presented in the batch-specific documentation accompanying 
Kymriah. 
For treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL): 
Body weight ≤50 kg: 1-3 bags contain a total of 0.2 to 5.0 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body 
weight. 
Body weight >50 kg: 1-3 bags contain a total of 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
For treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): 
1-3 bags contain a total of 0.6 to 6 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Other ingredients are: glucose, sodium chloride, human albumin solution, dextran 40 for injection, 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, magnesium 
chloride, sodium-N-acetyltryptophanate, sodium caprylate, aluminium and water for injections. 
Compatibility of CTL019 with the excipients stock solutions has been established during clinical 
development and is supported by the stability studies.  
The formulation development has been described.  
Pharmaceutical development studies were conducted to evaluate robustness and suitability of the 
chosen formulation for CTL019. The results support the selection of the current formulation. 
The inclusion of DMSO in the final formulation has been justified. 
The Applicant has discussed safety aspects of the excipients in the excipient stock solutions for infusion 
in paediatric patients, and concluded that they are unlikely to present a safety concern with the 
exception of DMSO and dextran 40. The amounts of these excipients used in patients can however be 
accepted. A warning on the known possibility of an anaphylactic reaction to dextran 40 and of the 
possible adverse effects of DMSO has been included in the product information. 
The finished product is supplied in EVA infusion bag(s) with PVC tubing and a luer spike interconnector 
closed by a luer-lock cap. 
Following a risk assessment of the manufacturing process to identify the highest risk factors for 
extractables and leachables, a leachable study was performed on the bags. This study identified the 
selected bags as the most suitable. The level of leachables identified with these bags was satisfactorily 
justified as safe, and toxicologic assessments are provided. 
The results of the container closure integrity study are acceptable.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Please refer to the active substance section. All manufacturing steps until release of the product have 
been described in the active substance part of the dossier as part of the continuous manufacturing 
process.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The specifications for the finished product were based on the analysis of the batches that were infused. 
The panel of specifications include tests for appearance, identity, purity, impurities, quantity, biological 
activity and microbial safety. 
The manufacturing process for CTL019 is a continuous process with no holding step; beginning with 
thawing of the leukapheresis starting material and ending with finished product formulation. The 
presented approach for the release testing is endorsed. 
 Potency is measured as to ensure appropriate CAR expression and cytokine secretion upon T cell 
activation.The proposed specifications are considered appropriate. However, the Applicant should re-
evaluate the release tests and their acceptance criteria based on post approval data.  
Analytical procedures 
A description of the analytical procedures used for specification testing is provided. The analytical 
assays were in general validated satisfactorily. A number of the validations are in respect of assays 
that represent derogations from Ph. Eur. assays. These have been validated against Ph. Eur. 
requirements.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analytical data for all batches manufactures at MP and FH IZI were presented. All provided 
stability for released batches are within specification. 
Reference standards 
An overview of the use of reference standards in the manufacture and analysis of CTL019 has been 
provided.  
No reference standard is routinely used for the control of CTL019. It is acknowledged that it would be 
unethical to retain a patient-specific batch of product for the purpose of standardization.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data, summaries, and conclusions are presented to support a shelf-life of 9 months for 
CTL019 stored in infusion bags at ≤ -120°C in vapour phase liquid nitrogen, and 30 minutes in-use 
shelf-life after thawing at room temperature 20-25°C.  
Stability data has been provided covering the long term storage condition as well as the in-use shelf-
life after thawing. 
All provided stability data for released finished product batches are within specification.

Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been provided in relation to the production 
cell bank for the viral vector. The PACMP is considered acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
The Applicant has given a satisfactory overview of the adventitious agent control strategy together 
with an overview of all materials of biological origin. Control of all raw and starting materials has been 
demonstrated satisfactorily.  
A number of materials of biological origin are used throughout the CTL019 manufacturing process. Due 
to the nature of the product, viral clearance studies are not considered feasible. 
Adequate information on TSE has been presented and the risk of inadvertent transmission of TSE 
agents from the manufacturing process to patients is considered low. 
A testing strategy for adventitious or endogenous viruses adopted throughout process manufacture is 
implemented.  In summary, raw materials of biological origin for CTL019 vector manufacture (including 
cell banks) are sufficiently described.  
Infectious disease testing of the donors will be performed as part of the patient leukapheresis eligibility 
process according to Annex IV of Dir. 2002/98/EC and any local additional testing requirements for 
tissues and cell donors.  
GMO 
CTL019 contains autologous genetically modified T cells. The product is manufactured from the 
patient’s own T cells, which are transduced with a lentiviral vector that encodes a chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR). Safety features of the virus are described above and an environmental risk 
assessment in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC has been presented with respect to the risk of 
release of GMO into the environment. This assessment is discussed in more detail in the non-clinical 
part. 
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of Kymriah has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to lack of appropriate documentation to 
demonstrate GMP compliance for the manufacturing/batch release sites. In response the Applicant 
provided satisfactory documentation for all three sites and consequently the major objection was 
resolved. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical 
and biological aspects as described above.

2.2.5.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CAT recommends several points for investigation including completing the characterisation and testing 
of the viral vector, the leukapheresis starting material and the finished product. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality 
development as described above. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical toxicology studies were not conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP), because there was no independent Quality Assurance (QA) audit of integral study parts and raw 
data storage was not applied in compliance with GLP regulations. The absence of GLP compliance is 
acceptable since standard single or repeat-dose toxicity studies could not be performed due to lack of a 
relevant animal model.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 
In vitro 
Selection of eukaryotic promotor for tisagenlecleucel [17] 
Experiments were performed to optimize tisagenlecleucel. Four eukaryotic promoters - elongation 
factor 1-alpha (EF-1α), cytomegalovirus (CMV), ubiquitin C (UbiC) and phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) - 
were evaluated for gene expression stability and level in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. T cells were 
transduced with lentiviruses expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of each of the 
four promoters in the tisagenlecleucel self-inactivating virus (SIN) backbone at a low multiplicity of 
infection (MOI, 0.2) (i.e. the amount of functional viral particles per cell) so that only one gene copy 
was integrated in a cell. Flow cytometry was used to detect GFP expression. 
In this study, EF-1α driven GFP expression was higher than for any other promoter in both CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells, and was stable for the 17 day duration of the experiment. Based on these results, EF-1α 
was selected as the promoter for expression of the transgene in tisagenlecleucel. 
Selection of costimulatory domain for tisagenlecleucel [17] 
Various αCD19 CARs were generated and tested for CD19-specific T cell function. The scFv (FMC63) 
recognizing CD19 was originally derived from a mouse hybridoma and has been characterized for its 
specificity to CD19 in several preclinical CAR T cell systems. In addition to tisagenlecleucel (αCD19-BB-
ζ, which contains the 4-1BB costimulatory domain from CD137), other αCD19 CARs were evaluated in 
parallel including αCD19-ζ (no costimulatory domain), αCD19-28-ζ (contains the CD28 costimulatory 
domain) and αCD19-28-BB-ζ (contains both the CD28 and 4-1BB costimulatory domains) to 
characterize the influence of the costimulatory domain on T effector cell function. To evaluate the

cytolytic function of CAR+ T cells, K562-wt and K562-CD19 cells lines were used as targets in a 
chromium release T cell killing assay. K562 is a myelogenous leukaemia cell line. 
T cells transduced with various αCD19 CARs, including αCD19-BB-ζ, killed K562 cells expressing CD19 
(K19) at low effector: target ratios (10:1, 30-50% killing) in a chromium release assay (Figure 8). 
Figure 4: Antigen-specific killing of CD19+ tumour cells by CD19-specific CAR+ T cells 
CAR+ T cell cytolytic activity against primary B-ALL tumour cells [17] 
Primary pre-B ALL cells were obtained from normally discarded cells obtained from individuals 
undergoing therapeutic apheresis for acute pre-B ALL. αCD19-BB-ζ [tisagenlecleucel] effector cells 
were capable of killing primary human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemic (ALL) cells expressing 
physiological levels of CD19 in a chromium release assay. Additionally, a full-length TCRζ domain was 
required for killing as αCD19 CAR with a truncated TCR ζ domain (Δζ) did not lyse targets. 
Cytokine production of CAR+ T cells after stimulation with tumour cells [17] 
Supernatant cytokine production from CAR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was quantified by a flow 
cytometry-based cytometric bead array in response to K562-wt and K562-CD19 as antigen presenting 
cells. For all CARs, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production from CD4+ T cells 
was comparable to TCR/CD28 receptor stimulation. IL-2 production was greater for αCD19-28-ζ and 
αCD19-BB-ζ [tisagenlecleucel] compared to αCD19-ζ transduced T cells. IFN-γ release from CD8+ T 
cells was similar for αCD19-BB-ζ and αCD19-ζ, while αCD19-28-ζ was significantly higher. Interleukin-4 
(IL-4) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), type 2 cytokines, were produced by all CAR+ CD4+ T cells. 
Tisagenlecleucel had decreased production compared to the other CAR constructs. 
Proliferation and survival of CAR+ T cells without CD19 re-stimulation [17] 
In vitro proliferation of CAR transduced T cells was tested in the absence of CD19 re-stimulation. CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells were engineered with the indicated CAR and expanded in the absences of K562-CD19 
stimulator cells.T cells expressing tisagenlecleucel had increased proliferative capacity, as measured by

population doublings, and survival, as measured by cell volume on day 8, during in vitro expansion 
compared to the other groups, independently of receptor ligation with the surrogate CD19 antigen.  
 
In vivo 
Determination of CART-19 specific tumour effects and dose optimization (CART-19 preclinical animal 
studies) 
Initial in vivo studies with first generation CAR (αCD19-ζ) were performed in mice. Mice were given T 
cells. The CAR construct αCD19-ζ showed target-dependent anti-tumour activity, as measured by a 
reduction in CD19+ ALL blasts in the peripheral blood. The reduction required an intact CD3ζ domain. 
Mock transduced T cells had minimal to no activity, supporting the lack of a general allogeneic T cell 
response to the tumour.  
A follow up study was carried out to determine the dose dependent effect of the αCD19-ζ constructs. 
Peripheral blood CD19+ B ALL blast cell counts were measured at weekly intervals in mice (>4 
mice/group) that were injected with the indicated numbers of αCD19-ζ CAR+ T cells or mock-
transduced T cells.  
Results showed that the blast count in the 5x106 CAR+ T cell group was significantly lower than the 
count in the Mock and no T cell groups (ANOVA on the log-transformed blast counts, P test p=0.008). 
Lower doses still had an anti-tumour effect which was proportional to the dose administered. 
Further, leukaemia-free survival over time was studied in animals receiving no T cells, mock-
transduced T cells, or αCD19 -ζ CAR+ T cells (5x106). Animals were assessed for leukaemia at weekly 
intervals. The group receiving αCD19-ζ cells showed an increased median survival (log-rank test, 
p<0.001) compared to animals receiving mock-transduced or no T cells. Five animals were included in 
each group. 
Determination of threshold of efficacy for CART-19 cells (CART-19 preclinical animal studies) 
Based on prior experiments, two cell doses were used for the αCD19-ζ CART-19 cells (2 x 106 and 5 x 
106), and for comparison, a dose of 2 x 106 of the αCD19-BB-ζ CART-19 cells was included. Mock 
transduced cells (20 x 106) and a no T cell group were included as controls for graft versus leukaemia 
effects and for B-ALL viability, respectively.  
Results showed that the threshold of efficacy was around 2 x 106 for the αCD19-ζ cells in this model. 
Both constructs were effective, and the bipartite αCD19-BB-ζ cells seemed to have a slight 
improvement in anti-tumour activity compared to αCD19-ζ at 2 x 106 cells/dose, but these results are 
not conclusive from this study. In addition, the mock transduced cells were given at a 4-fold higher 
dose than the αCD19-ζ cells. 
A follow-up study with the same model was conducted to evaluate all the CART-19 constructs at the 
threshold dose of 2 x 106 to compare the efficacy of the various signalling chains.  
All of the CARs showed potent anti-leukemic activity when 2x106 CAR+ T cells were injected two weeks 
after establishing leukaemia in the mice. The treatment effect was significant for the αCD19-ζ CAR 
(p<0.05) and for CARs that expressed costimulatory domains (p<0.01).  
Engraftment of CD4 and CD8 T cells was determined by Trucount analysis. There were no significant 
increase (p>0.14) in engraftment between the mock and CART-19 transduced cells, supporting the 
absence of uncontrolled cell proliferation of CART-19 cells in this model.

In vivo comparison of persistence, anti-B-ALL activity and effect on survival (CART-19 preclinical 
animal studies) 
In this series of investigations, the in vivo efficacy of T cells expressing the αCD19-ζ, αCD19- 28-ζ and 
αCD19-BB-ζ CARs was compared by injecting 10 million bulk T cells (adjusted to 50% CAR+ T cells in 
order to follow the fate of CAR+ vs. CAR- cells) three weeks after establishment of leukaemia in 
NOD/Shi-scid IL-2Rγ null (NOG) mice. In order to best track the transduced cells in vivo, CART-19 T 
cells were engineered to express GFP as well as the CAR.  
All CAR+ T cells exhibited significant anti-leukemic efficacy. Differences were observed in the 
engraftment and persistence of the CAR cells bearing different costimulatory domains. Four weeks 
following T cell injection, the total T cell counts were highest in mice after injection with αCD19-BB-ζ 
CAR+ T cells, and the T cells comprised of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR+ T cells. 
After injection into leukemic animals, the proportion of αCD19-BB-ζ CAR+ T cells was higher than 
αCD19-ζ CARs+ T cells and the αCD19-28-ζ CAR+ T cells (p<0.01). The enhanced engraftment and/or 
persistence of the αCD19-BB-ζ CAR+ CD4 and CD8 T cells was also observed in animals that were not 
injected with ALL cells (p<0.05).  
αCD19-BB-ζ expressing T cells showed a significant enhancement in anti-leukemic efficacy compared 
with T cells expressing either the αCD19-ζ or αCD19-28-ζ receptors. Median leukaemia free survival 
was increased by 7 weeks (p=0.009). Based upon an approximate doubling time of 2.7 days for pre-B 
ALL cells (derived by fitting the leukemic blast counts in untreated animals to an exponential growth 
model), this 7-week delay in onset of leukaemia corresponds to a reduction in leukaemia burden of 
>105–fold following T cell injection when compared with the burden present in animals receiving either 
the αCD19-ζ or αCD19-28-ζ modified T cells.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
One non-clinical bio distribution study has been performed to investigate the pharmacokinetic 
properties of tisagenlecleucel. NOG mice (4 animals/group) were engrafted with human acute B-ALL 
(Study Day 0), followed three weeks (21 days) later by CAR+ T cells at doses of 1 x 10 P

immunoreceptor) and αCD19-BB-ζ CAR (i.e. tisagenlecleucel; LTG119 vector which expresses the scFv 
αCD19-CD3-ζ-4-1-BBL chimeric immunoreceptor). There were 2.4 copies of LTG118 and 1.7 copies of 
Assessment report

Page 31 
 
 
 
 
 
LTG119 relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the vector 119/vector 
118 ratio was 0.7.  
Scheduled sacrifices took place on Study Day 42 and 56 (21 and 35 days after administration of the T 
cells). At subsequent time points, animals were sacrificed when they appeared to be moribund, with 
any remaining animals being sacrificed on approximately Study Day 217. At 21 and 35 days after the 
administration of the mixture of the T cells, the T cells were detected in the spleen, lung and kidney in 
all animals that were administered 20 x 10P
6
P cells except for kidney sample from one animal (35 days 
post-dose; LTG118 and LTG119). In the bone marrow valid results could not be obtained at 21 days 
post dose; however, T cells could be detected in all animals at 35 days post-dose. At the lower dose

could be detected in the spleen, kidney and bone marrow of one animal that was administered a dose 
of 5 x 10P
6
P cells. 
At both 21 and 35 days post T cell dose, the median number of copies of vector/500 ng DNA was 
approximately 3-20x higher in the lung compared to the spleen, kidney and bone marrow. The number 
of copies was similar in the spleen, kidney and bone marrow samples. On Study Day 217, the number 
of copies of T cells with LTG119 vector in the one animal that was administered a dose of 5 x 10 P
6
P cells 
were higher in the bone marrow than in the spleen with the number of copies being lowest in the 
kidney. The number of copies of T cells with the LTG118 vector was higher in the spleen than in the 
bone marrow, with no valid result being obtained in the kidney sample. 
There was a good correlation between the number of copies of the LTG118 and LTG119 vectors in the 
spleen and kidney on Study Days 42 and 56. The correlation was less evident in the lung and bone 
marrow.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No standard single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No standard repeat-dose toxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Genotoxicity 
ULentivirus integration site analysis characterization of tisagenlecleucel using lentivirus insertion site 
analysis (Report 1620234, non-GLP) 
Lentivirus insertion site analysis (LISA) was conducted on tisagenlecleucel manufacturing samples from 
6 paediatric ALL (CCTL019B2202), 6 DLBCL (CCTL019C2201) patients and 2 healthy volunteers [18]. 
In general the integration pattern seen with the tisagenlecleucel vector resembles well known patterns 
for lentiviral integration. In all the analysed tisagenlecleucel products a high degree of polyclonality 
was observed and there was no evidence for preferential integration near genes of concern, or

preferential outgrowth of cells harbouring integration sites of concern during the cell culture in the 
manufacturing process.  
ULentivirus integration site analysis characterization of tisagenlecleucel using shearing-extension primer 
tag selection and ligation-mediated PCR (Report 1620234a, non-GLP) 
The same  DNA samples used in the lentivirus insertion site analysis (LISA) were also processed by 
sonication and shearing-extension primer tag selection (S-EPTS) followed by ligation-mediated PCR 
(LM-PCR) [19]. 
The general integration pattern was consistent with lentiviral infection, all analysed tisagenlecleucel 
products showed high degree of polyclonality and no evidence for preferential integration near genes of 
concern or preferential outgrowth of cells harbouring such integration sites during the manufacturing 
process. 
Carcinogenicity

Dynabeads 
Tisagenlecleucel product is engineered using magnetic anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads (Dynabeads) for T 
cell enrichment and activation. The potential for acute toxicity from Dynabeads M-450 Sheep Anti-
Mouse IgG ST (SAM-Beads) administered once intravenously to male and female rats was assessed 
[20]. Rats administered 9.6 x 104 beads/kg were killed 14 days posttreatment. Rats administered 8.3 
x 108 beads/kg were killed either 14 or 42 days posttreatment. Saline containing 0.5% PPF served as 
the control article. Treatment groups were statistically compared with respect to clinical chemistry, 
haematology parameters, and body weight data. No significant group differences were detected (α = 
0.01) with respect to any statistically analyzed data. The majority of the SAM-Beads were found in the 
lung, liver, and spleen and were slightly more numerous among animals who were killed at 14 days. 
There was also a trend toward an increased incidence and/or distribution of phagocytized beads in the 
bone marrow of animals killed 42 days posttreatment when compared with the 14-day killed animals. 
A few extracellular beads were present in the lymph nodes, kidneys, and sternal bone marrow. Under 
the conditions of this study, intravenous administration of Dynabeads M-450 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG ST

did not result in any adverse test-article-related macroscopic, clinical pathologic, or histopathologic 
changes. 
In rats, Dynabead-labelled pancreatic islets transplanted into the liver through the portal vein could be 
visualized weekly by MRI in vivo and did not noticeably change in either their shape or their size and 
remained in the same positions during the entire monitored period of 2 months [21]. 
The worst-case exposure of paediatric patients to residual Dynabeads after infusion of the 
tisagenlecleucel product (activated viable T cells) can be assessed as follows: 
 
specification for beads: ≤ 50 beads per 3 x 106 cells 
  maximum number of viable cells (transduced and non-transduced) per single dose of 
tisagenlecleucel product for paediatric use: 5 x 109 total cells (in 50 mL) 
  maximum number of beads per single dose of tisagenlecleucel product: 5 x 109 cells x 50 
beads / 3 x 106 cells = 83’333 beads 
 
for 3-6 year old children with 18.6 kg average body weight (EPA, 2008): 83’333 beads / 18.6 
kg = 4480 beads/kg (or for a child with 50 kg body weight: 83’333 beads / 50 kg = 1667 
beads/kg). 
The maximum number of residual Dynabeads in tisagenlecleucel product for injection to children (4480 
beads/kg) is more than 20-fold lower than the low dose in rats (96’000 beads/kg), where no beads 
were detected in any tissue, and thus is considered not to represent an undue safety risk to the 
patient. 
Benzyl alcohol 
Patients administered Kymriah is estimated to be exposed to a maximum level of 21 µg benzyl alcohol 
(BZA) per dose/day (equivalent to 1.5 µg/kg body weight for a 2-year old child with 13.8 kg body 
weight). BZA is a natural constituent of a number of plants and is used as a flavouring substance in 
some foods and beverages.  
An estimated maximum exposure level of 21 µg BZA per dose/day (equivalent to 1.5 µg/kg body 
weight for a 2-year old child with 13.8 kg body weight) administered intravenously is considered to 
pose a low toxicological risk to children ≥2 years based on the below considerations: 
• 
it is approx. 10-fold and 12-fold below the single IV exposure levels of 0.0146 and 0.0186 
mg/kg body weight that were without any adverse effects in preterm and term infants, 
respectively  
• 
it is approx. 730-fold below the lowest IV exposure level of 1.1 mg/kg body weight/day for at 
least 2 days that was not associated with hypertension, seizures, vomiting, or clinical or 
laboratory indications of liver or kidney toxicity in preterm infants  
• 
it is 18000-fold below the highest IV exposure level of 27 mg/kg body weight/day for 8 days 
that was not associated with kernicterus or intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants 
• 
it is approx. 21300-fold below the lowest IV exposure level of 32 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 
days at which potential clinical symptoms of benzyl alcohol poisoning were present in a 
preterm infant but could not be distinguished from clinical manifestations of asphyxia and 
underlying hyaline membrane disease 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 34 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
it is 66000-fold below the lowest IV exposure level of 99 mg/kg body weight/day for 2 to 28 
days that was associated with the “gasping syndrome” in premature infants in the early 1980s  
 
hepatic metabolism and renal clearance mechanisms, which are considered most relevant to 
minimize risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity and “gasping syndrome” in paediatric populations, are 
considered mature in children ≥2 years of age 
 
according to the “EMA QA on benzyl alcohol used as an excipient in medicinal products for 
human use” (2017), benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates, buy may be used for 
children aged older than 4 weeks with caution. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to drug formulations containing BZA have been reported in adults: such 
reactions occurring in the paediatric population cannot be ruled out. 
2-Ethylhexanol (2-EH) 
2-EH is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and rapidly 
eliminated. After oral gavage of 50 or 500 mg EH/kg to female rats, the absorption rate was about 
80%, independent of the administered dose. The main metabolic pathway is via 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 
followed by conjugation with glucuronic acid. 
An estimated maximum exposure level of 15 μg 2-ethylhexanol per dose/day (equivalent to approx. 
1.1 μg/kg body weight for a 2-year old child with 13.8 kg body weight) administered intravenously is 
significantly below the above mentioned oral ADI level, and thus considered not to represent an undue 
safety risk to children ≥2 years, in particular since tisagenlecleucel will be administered with a very low 
frequency, i.e. maximum 2-3 administrations per lifetime. 
Dextran 40 
Dextran is a high molecular-weight polymer of α-D-glucose, which contains long linear chains of 
saccharide units with occasional short (one or two unit) branches. Anaphylactic reactions to Dextran-
40 occur in approximately 1-5 cases per 10,000 patients treated with Dextran-40. This warning is also 
included in the LMD (dextran 40) prescribing information.  
DMSO 
DMSO total quantity present in the final product is within the current practice in transplantation, i.e. no 
more than 1g/kg body weight.

membrane surface protein array. This protein array covers approximately 3550 full human membrane 
proteins, which are expressed on HEK293 cells.  
With the exception of CD19 none of the proteins presented in this assay were identified by the murine 
CD19 CAR scFv. No clinical effects related to cross-reactivity to non-CD19 targets were reported thus 
far. 
Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and RTPCR analysis on human and cynomolgus monkey 
CNS tissues (Novartis studies 1420055 and 1420059) 
Immunohistochemistry was performed with commercially available rabbit monoclonal antibodies on 
cerebrum and cerebellum and did not detect CD19 protein expression in either species. This finding 
was confirmed by in situ hybridization which failed to show CD19 mRNA in the brain.  
Anti-CD19 human-scFv (from tisagenlecleucel) rabbit-Fc and anti-CD19 murine-scFv rabbit-Fc chimeric 
tool reagents were also developed. While these tool reagents detected CD19 on human cell lines (K562 
cells expressing CD19) and normal human tissue (tonsils and spleen), they did not produce a specific 
reaction in human brain tissue.  
In addition, RTPCR analysis of the expression of 5 human and 3 cynomolgus CD19 splice variants in 
respective brain tissues was negative.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment was performed in accordance with Annex II to Directive 
2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and 
following the precautionary principle using the methodology set down in Commission Decisions 
2002/812/EC and 2002/623/EC and EMA guidelines on environmental risk assessments for medicinal 
products consisting of, or containing GMOs (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/473191/2006) and on scientific 
requirements for the environmental risk assessment of gene therapy medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/GTWP/125491/2006). 
In  accordance  with  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  national  competent  authorities 
established under Directive 2001/18/EC have been consulted. 
Potential hazards  
• 
Presence of RCL in the drug product and transmission to contact persons e.g. during application, 
after shedding, or via donation of blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation, bears the risk of 
infection of human beings, other than the patient, with a new replication competent lentivirus (HIV 
lentivirus). Theoretically, vector mobilization may occur by generation of RCL during manufacturing of 
the vector or of the GMO. The magnitude of this theoretical potential adverse effect for the 
environment is considered to be high, since a new replication competent lentivirus could be released to 
and spread within human populations.  
• 
Formation of RCL in patients may occur by vector mobilization as the consequence of 
complementation between proviral and host sequences after administration of tisagenlecleucel to the 
patient bearing the risk of transmission of a new lentivirus to contact persons after shedding or via 
donation of blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. This hypothetical homologous 
recombination between the retroviral vector in its proviral form with an endogenous retrovirus could 
either be in the shape of a completely new type of lentivirus, or, in the case of a patient who is HIV+ 
from before, the generation of new HIV viruses. The magnitude of this theoretical potential adverse

effect for the environment is considered to be high, since a new replication competent lentivirus could 
be released to and spread within human populations. 
• 
Presence of residual non-replicative infectious lentiviral vectors in the drug product and 
transmission to contact persons, either during application, after shedding or via donation of blood, 
organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. The magnitude of this theoretical potential adverse effect 
for the environment is considered to be low, since only few contact persons would be affected without 
the risk of spreading to human populations. Furthermore, adverse effects to any person exposed are 
unlikely due to the (benign) nature of the vector.  
• 
Transmission of genetically modified T-cells, e.g. by accidental infusion of the drug product or 
via donation of blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. The magnitude of this theoretical 
potential adverse effect for the environment is considered to be negligible, since the (allogeneic) 
genetically modified cells are expected to be rapidly cleared by the host immune system. 
Evaluation of likelihood 
 
Likelihood of presence of RCLs in the final product and subsequent transmission of RCRs to 
thirds: The deleted elements in the design of the vector system minimize vector recombination 
probability and thus the possibility of generation of RCL. In addition, the final product is 
washed with multiple steps in the manufacturing process and therefore the viral vectors that 
potentially could have been present in Kymriah will have been reduced by a factor of 5000. 
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that measurable functional vector particle would be present in 
Kymriah.  
 
Likelihood of formation of RCL in patients: CTL019 lentiviral vector is a 3rd generation self-
inactivating vector designed to minimize the likelihood of RCL emergence, as packaging 
plasmids are provided in trans and split on to 3 different plasmids. Plasmid sequences have 
been optimized to have minimal homology with the parental HIV, in order to minimize the 
chance of homologous recombination. Therefore, formation of RCL in patients is considered 
highly unlikely. Horizontal gene transfer of CTL019 lentiviral vector sequences could only 
happen upon generation of RCL in a significant number of patients, post-administration of 
Kymriah, and their being shed into the environment. This would require co-infection of CAR+ T 
cells together with retroviruses with sufficient sequence homologies for recombination to occur, 
which is highly improbable since the risk of RCL formation has been reduced to the minimum. 
 
Likelihood of transmission of replication-incompetent vectors. Since the CTL019 lentiviral 
vector is replication deficient, only one round on infection can occur, and for a potential 
adverse effect to happen, significant numbers of free lentiviral particles would have to be 
released directly into the environment. Such a scenario is highly unlikely as no free vector is 
present in the end-product, due to the multiple washing steps. 
 
Likelihood of transmission of genetically modified T-cells by accidental administration to thirds 
or after bleeding: The risk for the environment in general and for transmission to third parties 
associated with the genetically modified T cells is low, as the risk of accidental administration is 
minimized by the safety measures during application, and the lack of survival capability of T- 
cells in the environment. If transmitted to third parties through direct contact e.g. during 
application, the (allogeneic) genetically modified cells are expected to be recognized by the 
immune system and cleared rapidly. Thus, the likelihood of hazard by transmission of 
genetically modified T-cells is deemed as negligible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 38 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the likelihood of all hazards identified is evaluated to be negligible, also the overall risk for the 
environment is considered to be negligible, provided that the safety measures described are applied.  
However, a number of measures are implemented to prevent any potentially remaining minimal risks. 
First of all, tisagenlecleucel will only be supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are 
appropriately qualified and only if the healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of a patient 
have completed the educational programme. The standard measures for universal blood product and 
routine cleaning procedures using adequate disinfectant is deemed as appropriate, also for the case of 
spillage of the drug product. Furthermore, since cancer patients are generally excluded from donation 
of blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation, also patients treated with Kymriah will be 
excluded from donations. 
Altogether, the strategies to prevent theoretical minimal risks for the environment are deemed as 
appropriate for the intended use of Kymriah. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Referenced literature in the application indicated that 4-1BB favours the outgrowth of younger, central 
memory T cells responses, whereas CD28 drives toward more effector memory T cell responses with 
an exhausted phenotype. Further, central memory T cells are believed to have higher proliferative 
potential and can mediate better anti-tumour immunity through the generation and maintenance of a 
pool of memory cells, whereas effector memory T cells are more short-lived with limited proliferative 
capacity. Exhausted T cells are neither able to proliferate nor mediate effector functions. 
Immunophenotypic sub-typing of the CAR+ T cells have been performed with other CAR-T DLBCL 
treatments [22]. Similar phenotyping of tisagenlecleucel CAR+ T cells has not been provided in the 
non-clinical dossier. Even though such information is valuable, the lack of these data is considered 
acceptable taken into consideration the knowledge about the CAR+ T cell properties gathered through 
clinical experience. 
Milone et al [17] discuss findings with other constructs indicating that CARs containing either 4-1BB or 
CD28 endomains were equivalently active at controlling large tumours, and that the combination of 
CD28 and 4-1BB cytosolic domains resulted in the best persistence of CAR+ T cells in the tumour 
bearing mice and that 4-1BB endodomains tended to keep CAR+ T cells in a central memory state. The 
authors suggested that the optimal signals required by CARs may be dependent on the particular 
tumour being targeted and/or the nature of the particular single-chain variable fragment antibody. 
Thus, leaving the CD28 domain out of the tisagenlecleucel construct seems to be based on limited data 
from primary tumours, and some of these data actually indicate that the tripartite construct is more 
effective than the bipartite construct. Tisagenlecleucel is a so-called second (2G) CAR containing only 
one signalling domain. Subsequent to the 2G CAR constructs a third generation (3G) of CARs has 
appeared. These CARs contain multiple costimulatory domains, such as the tripartite construct tested 
here. Clinical trials with 3G cars with both CD28 and 4-1BB are currently ongoing [23].  
The in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies were performed using tumour cells from patients with ALL, 
and not from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The lack of non-clinical 
pharmacology studies with DLBCL cells is acceptable based on the clinical experience with this 
indication. 
Concerning the use of different vectors, the pharmacology studies were conducted with cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector made at the University of Pennsylvania, or at a further facility in the 
US, whereas clinical studies were done with cells transduced with vector made by Oxford Biomedica in

the UK. The two manufacturing sites used different plasmids to generate the lentiviral vectors used. 
The commercial supply is intended from a site in Germany at the Fraunhofer Institute, in Leipzig. In 
2015, the applicant sought CHMP advice on comparative in vivo pharmacology studies to support this 
change. The CHMP advised that such studies were inappropriate as they do not have the capacity to 
generate results that could be interpreted in the context of a comparability exercise. The absence of 
comparative in vivo preclinical experiments to support the use of the clinical product in Europe is thus 
agreed. 
The lack of single-dose toxicity studies is acceptable, since tisagenlecleucel is a patient specific 
product, which is not appropriate to administer to immune competent animals. The lack of repeat-dose 
toxicity studies is acceptable based on the fact that tisagenlecleucel will be administered as a single IV 
infusion, and since tisagenlecleucel is a patient specific product which is not appropriate to administer 
to immune competent animals. 
Genotoxicity assays and carcinogenicity studies in rodents are not appropriate to assess the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis for genetically modified cell therapy products. No alternative adequate animal 
models are available (SmPC, section 5.3). 
The risk of inadvertent germline transmission of the CD19 CAR construct has not been addressed; 
however, the Guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer 
vectors, EMEA/273974/2005 indicates that the risk of germline transmission associated with the 
administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal testing of 
human cells may be difficult or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human 
genetically modified cells are not recommended.  
In vitro expansion studies with CAR positive T cells (Kymriah) from healthy donors and patients 
showed no evidence for transformation and/or immortalisation of T cells. In vivo studies in 
immunocompromised mice did not show signs of abnormal cell growth or signs of clonal cell expansion 
for up to 7 months, which represents the longest meaningful observation period for 
immunocompromised mouse models. A genomic insertion site analysis of the lentiviral vector was 
performed on Kymriah products from 14 individual donors (12 patients and 2 healthy volunteers). 
There was no evidence for preferential integration near genes of concern or preferential outgrowth of 
cells harbouring integration sites of concern (SmPC, section 5.3). 
This medicinal product contains 2.43 mg sodium per mL. This medicinal product contains 24.3 to 
121.5 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 0.01 to 0.06% of the WHO recommended maximum daily 
intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This is to be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled 
sodium diet. This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. 
essentially “potassium free” (SmpC, section 4.4). 
This medicinal product contains 10 mg dextran 40 and 82.5 mg dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per mL. 
Each of these excipients are known to possibly cause anaphylactic reaction following parenteral 
administration. Patients not previously exposed to dextran should be observed closely during the first 
minutes of the infusion period (SmpC, section 4.4). 
It is concluded that there is a negligible risk for the environment associated with the clinical use of 
Kymriah. Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) may be generated during the tisagenlecleucel 
manufacturing or subsequently after introduction of vector transduced viable T-cells into the patient. 
Generation of replication competent lentivirus has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018

Insertion of lentiviral vector sequences throughout the genome has the potential to dysregulate local 
host cell gene expression with a theoretical risk of insertional oncogenesis resulting from disruption of 
normal function of genes that control cell growth and potential risk of development of secondary 
malignancies. New or secondary malignancies (including vector insertion site oligo/monoclonality) have 
been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Kymriah contains genetically-modified human blood cells. Local biosafety guidelines should be followed 
for unused medicinal product or waste material. All material that has been in contact with Kymriah 
(solid and liquid waste) should be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in 
accordance with local biosafety guidelines(SmpC, section 6.6). 
The CHMP endorses the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 5.1, 5.3, 6.6) and in the RMP. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

All cellular kinetic parameters indicative of expansion (Cmax) and persistence (AUC, Tlast) were 
derived from the clinical phase II pivotal and supportive studies B2202, B2205J, B2101J (ALL 
indication) and C2201 (DLBCL indication). Cellular kinetics were determined from peripheral blood and 
bone marrow samples analysed by qPCR (i.e. number of copies of CAR per µg of DNA), and flow 
cytometry (i.e. % CTL019 expressing CD3+ cells). The impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on 
cellular kinetics were assessed using NCA (both indications) and population modelling (ALL). 
Tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics was presented for the individual studies and for pooled data (SPC 
pool) generated from studies with similar study designs (B2202 and B2205J). 
Absorption  
Tisagenlecleucel is administered as an IV infusion  
Following infusion of Kymriah into paediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL and r/r DLBCL patients, 
Kymriah typically exhibited an initial rapid expansion followed by a slower bi-exponential decline 
(SmPC section 5.2). 
ALL indication 
Tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics were characterised after IV infusion of CAR-positive viable T cells in 
three studies.

Table 5. Summary of peripheral blood cellular kinetic parameters for tisagenlecleucel by 
qPCR by indication  
Distribution 
In paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients, tisagenlecleucel has been shown to be present in the 
blood and bone marrow beyond 2 years (study B2101J). The blood to bone marrow partitioning of 
tisagenlecleucel in bone marrow was 47.2% of that present in blood at day 28 while at months 3 and 6 
it distributes at 68.3% and 69%, respectively (Studies B2202 and B2205J). Tisagenlecleucel also 
traffics and persists in cerebrospinal fluid in paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients (Study 
B2101J) for up to 1 year (SmPC, section 5.2). 
In adult DLBCL patients (Study C2201), tisagenlecleucel has been detected for up to 2 years in 
peripheral blood and up to month 9 in bone marrow for complete responder patients. The blood to 
bone marrow partitioning in bone marrow was nearly 70% of that present in blood at day 28 and 50% 
at month 3 in both responder and non-responder patients (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The elimination profile of Kymriah includes a bi exponential decline in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
There is no apparent relationship between dose and AUC0 28d or Cmax (SmPC, section 5.2).

tisagenlecleucel by qPCR- SCP Pool (Pharmacokinetic analysis set) 
Body weight 
In DLBCL patients, across the weight ranges (38.4 to 186.7 kg), the scatter plots of qPCR cellular 
kinetic parameters versus weight revealed no apparent relationship between cellular kinetic 
parameters with weight (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK drug interaction studies have been conducted with tisagenlecleucel. 
Tocilizumab, inhibitor of interleukin-6, was administered for the management of cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS). In the SCP Pool, 35 patients (33.7%) received tocilizumab for the management of 
CRS. The onset of CRS often coincides with the initial expansion of tisagenlecleucel followed by a peak 
in cytokines such as IL-6. In this population, the CR/CRi patients treated with tocilizumab to manage 
CRS, had approximately 333% and 220% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax, respectively, compared with 
CR/CRi patients that did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab is most commonly administered to 
patients with grade 3/4 CRS and these patients also tend to have greater expansion and higher Cmax 
and AUC0-28d. Tisagenlecleucel AUC0-28d and Cmax determined from qPCR data in study B2202, were 
358% and 216% higher in CR/CRi patients treated with tocilizumab compared with patients that did 
not receive tocilizumab; and in study B2205J, approximately 236% and 196% higher, respectively, 
than patients that did not receive tocilizumab. Per the CRS treatment algorithm, patients with CRS that 
did not respond to tocilizumab received corticosteroids for limited dosage and duration and weaned 
rapidly. CR/CRi patients that received corticosteroids had 68% higher AUC0-28d compared with CR/CRi 
patients that did not receive corticosteroids. In this paediatric ALL study, high tumour burden at 
baseline resulted in higher expansion, and as a result, these patients experienced CRS and thus 
received tocilizumab for CRS management, depending on the severity.

For the r/r DLBCL-indication, the impact of anti-cytokine medication, tocilizumab, on the cellular 
kinetics of tisagenlecleucel was investigated in study C2201. Transgene continues to expand and 
persist following tocilizumab administration. The Cmax and AUC0-28d of transgene were 286% and 219% 
higher, respectively, in patients that received tocilizumab for CRS management compared to patients 
that did not receive tocilizumab. Patients with grade 3/4 CRS generally have higher expansion of 
transgene compared to patients with grade 1/2 CRS or no CRS.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No formal clinical pharmacology studies were performed for tisagenlecleucel. All clinical pharmacology 
related endpoints and analyses are derived from Study C2201 (DLBCL) or studies B2202, B2205J and 
B2101J (ALL indication). 
Mechanism of action 
No specific mechanism of action studies have been conducted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Antibodies binding to murine CAR19 in human serum were measured using a validated flow cytometry 
method, and levels were reported by median fluorescence intensity (MFI). T cell activation was 
measured by the percentage of interferon gamma (IFNγ) positive cells detected by intracellular 
staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis. A positive treatment-induced immunogenicity 
response was determined by change from baseline value to the post-treatment value. In the SCP pool 
(ALL indication), the majority of patients (84.6 %; n=88) tested positive for pre-dose anti-mCAR19 
antibodies (i.e. pre-existing immunogenicity). Treatment induced-immunogenicity was detected in 34.6 
% of patients. Several analyses supported that observed ADA amounts did not impact cellular kinetics. 
A concentration time profile of tisagenlecleucel transgene by occurrence (or lack) of treatment-induced 
immunogenicity, showed consistent exposure between the two groups. Cellular kinetic parameters 
summarised by ADA positive or negative, showed that Cmax, AUC0-28d, Tmax, and T1/2 are comparable 
between the categories and within the observed kinetic variability observed in this population overall.  
Methods used to analyse humoral and cellular immunogenicity in the r/r DLBCL population, were the 
same as were used in the pALL population. The majority of patients (main cohort patients according to 
the CSR; 91.4%) tested positive for pre-dose ADAs (i.e., pre-existing immunogenicity) and 5% of the 
patients had treatment-induced anti-mCAR19 antibodies. Pre-existing antibodies were not associated 
with any impact on clinical response nor had an impact on the in vivo initial expansion and persistence 
(Cmax and AUC0-28d) of tisagenlecleucel. The levels of pre-existing immunogenicity seen in DLBCL 
patients are consistent with observations in healthy donor samples evaluated during the assay 
validation. A strip plot of ADAs by time points showed that the assay signal was consistent across time 
points for individual patients. Treatment-induced or boosted anti-mCAR19 antibodies were observed in 
five patients in the Pharmacokinetic analysis set, while the majority of patients tested negative. The 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-28d estimates were observed to be 70% and 152% higher in patients 
with treatment-induced or boosted anti-tisagenlecleucel antibodies post-tisagenlecleucel infusion.

The impact of several extrinsic factors on tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics was evaluated. Both the 
pediatric ALL and r/r DLBCL patients received a multitude of therapies prior to receiving 
tisagenlecleucel. The purpose of these analyses was to evaluate their impact on cellular kinetics. 
Results of the analyses indicated that the number of lines of prior therapy, prior SCT (stem cell 
transplantation), and treatment with lymphodepleting (LD) regimens did not seem to impact the 
cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel (data not shown).  
Relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in study C2201 may have received rituximab, an anti-
CD20 monoclonal antibody, as part of prior treatment regimens. Thirty-three patients received 
antineoplastic therapy post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (mainly nivolumab and rituximab (10.1% each) in 
Study C2201. Rituximab has a long half-life (~22 days), and is known to cause B-cell depletion [24], 
and tisagenlecleucel has previously been shown to cause long term B cell aplasia. High levels of 
rituximab were measurable at Day 21 following tisagenlecleucel infusion. Data were limited in PR and 
SD patients due to fewer patients in these responses categories. During the study after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, only two patients showed CD19+ B cell levels returning to normal range (or 
slightly above normal range), as of the data cut-off date. B cell levels immediately prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion were summarised by absence or presence of detectable levels of rituximab. 
Patients with detectable rituximab prior to tisagenlecleucel did not have measurable B cell levels. In 
contrast, some patients without measurable rituximab levels (at baseline) had detectable B cells. 
  ALL indication 
Dose response analyses 
The relationship between tisagenlecleucel dose and response (efficacy and safety) was explored using 
individual study data and SCP Pool. All patients in the SCP Pool (n=104) were included in the dose 
response analyses. Efficacy endpoints evaluated for dose response analysis included Day 28 response, 
DOR and EFS. The safety endpoints evaluated were CRS grade, time to resolution of hematopoietic 
cytopenias and neurological events.  
The logistic regression dose response for patients >50 kg showed an increasing trend in probability of 
response for doses between 0.1 x 10 P

P CAR-positive viable T cells per kg, after which the probability of

In Study B2202, 52 patients were ≤ 50 kg and 23 patients were >50 kg; in Study B2205J, 17 patients 
were ≤ 50 kg and 12 patients were >50 kg. Based on results of logistic regression analysis, a doubling 
in total dose is associated with an odds ratio of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.000, 2.424) on average. Weight group 
(>50 kg and ≤ 50 kg) did not have a significant impact on the model. A consistent result was obtained 
in logistic regression analysis for Day 28 response and body weight adjusted tisagenlecleucel CAR -
positive viable cell dose. 
Analyses of Day 28 response by dose quartile were performed for the SCP Pool (for patients >50 kg 
and patients ≤ 50 kg) (Table 13 and Table 14).

The KM analysis of DOR for patients ≤ 50 kg indicated a similar DOR in patients treated with doses 
greater than or less than the median weight adjusted cell dose in the SCP Pool. The KM analysis of 
DOR for patients > 50 kg indicated separation between curves of less than and more than median total 
dose after Month four. However, there were only nine events out of the 28 patients included in this 
analysis with the rest of the patients censored so it may be premature to make definitive conclusions. 
The median DOR in patients with ≤ median dose was 8.6 months while it was not reached in patients 
with > median dose. In the SCP pool, based on the Cox regression model of DOR by log of weight 
adjusted dose, the hazard ratio for a doubling in dose was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.08). 
In study B2101J, the dose-DOR analysis, indicated a separation between curves for patients that 
received doses greater than the median dose and patients that received doses less than the median 
dose for both weight categories (>50 kg and ≤ 50 kg). Additionally, in Study B2101J the Cox 
regression model of DOR by log of weight adjusted dose, the hazard ratio for a doubling in dose was 
1.20 (95% CI: 0.67, 2.12).

The impact of dose on EFS was analysed by plotting the weight -adjusted dose by EFS category (EFS 
event ≥ 3 months, EFS event <3 months, EFS censor <3 months, treatment failure, and other). The 
results of dose and EFS category analysis showed that there is no apparent effect of dose on EFS 
categories analysed although many of the categories had a small sample size (data not shown). 
The impact of body weight (≤ 50 kg and >50 kg) on EFS was analysed using KM plot. The result of K-
M analysis indicated that there is no clinically meaningful separation in the two curves. The median 
time for EFS in the patients of body weight >50 kg was 9.8 months, whereas the median EFS time in 
the patients ≤ 50 kg was not reached.  
Dose-safety analysis 
Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of dose on the probability of CRS in 
the SCP Pool. Results of the logistic regression analysis showed that there is no apparent impact of 
dose on grade 3/4 CRS. There is a slight trend for increased risk of grade 4 CRS with higher CAR-
positive viable T cell dose for patients ≤ 50kg (weight adjusted); (Figure 9). 
Figure 5 Logistic regression of CRS vs. dose, overlaid with observed data (SCP Pool) (FAS)  
There is no notable increased risk for neurological events with increasing dose (data not shown). There 
is no apparent impact of dose on the time to the resolution of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (data 
not shown). 
A further analysis indicated a minimal apparent difference in time to resolution of hematopoietic 
cytopenias depending on dose. The hazard ratio for a doubling of total dose was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.79, 
1.26) for neutropenia while for thrombocytopenia it was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.32). 
Exposure-response relationship 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between tisagenlecleucel 
exposure metrics and efficacy endpoints including Day 28 response, DOR, and EFS.

- Exposure versus event-free survival - EFS  
Summary statistics of cellular kinetic parameters based on EFS category in the SCP Pool (EFS ≥ 3 
months, EFS event <3 months, EFS censor <3 months, Treatment failure, and other) showed that 
patients with EFS category ≥ 3 months tend to have higher exposure (AUC0-28d and Cmax) compared 
with patients with EFS event <3 months and treatment failure patients. For pooled data, EFS 
categories <3 months and treatment failures tend to have prolonged Tmax (median of 21.0 and 19.5 
days respectively) compared with EFS ≥ 3 months (median 9.84 days).The geometric mean and 
arithmetic mean (SD) concentration-time profiles for transgene in peripheral blood, by EFS categories 
revealed sustained persistence for patients with EFS ≥ 6 months and an earlier and more rapid loss of 
transgene in patients with an EFS< 6 months . Similar results were seen in B2101J. 
- Exposure versus day 28 response 
The logistic regression of Day 28 response on AUC0-28d and Cmax showed a flat relationship was 
observed between Day 28 response and cellular kinetic parameters (AUC0-28d and Cmax) in Studies 
B2202 and B2205J. Since patients with unknown response have high exposure based on summary 
statistics, including them in the logistic regression analysis as non-responders may have made any 
potential relationship between exposure and response less obvious. Therefore additional logistic 
regressions were done excluding patients with unknown response as sensitivity analyses. These logistic 
regressions models showed that there is still minimal impact of AUC0-28d and Cmax on Day 28 
response when patients with unknown response were excluded. 
Analyses of Day 28 response by quartile of qPCR AUC R0-28dR and Cmax was performed by study and in 
SCP Pool which indicated that the Day 28 disease response was similar across the exposure quartiles in 
the SCP Pool. In study B2202, CR/CRi patients have higher and longer exposure to tisagenlecleucel 
transgene (measured by qPCR) as compared to NR patients. Cmax was approximately 1.7-fold higher 
in CR/CRi patients, compared to NR patients. Cellular kinetics measured by CD3+CAR+ levels 
(measured by flow cytometry), also indicated minimal expansion of CD3+/CTL019+ cells in non-
responders compared with responders. In study B2101J also, CR/CRi patients, the transgene level in 
peripheral blood reveal a kinetic profile with an initial rapid expansion followed by a slower decay 
function with some fluctuations of transgene over time resulting in higher AUC R0-28dR, CRmaxR and longer 
T1/2 compared to NR patients who tended to have a lower expansion and faster decay (i.e. shorter 
T1/2) of CAR-positive T cells. The flow cytometry results substantiate the trend for higher exposures 
observed in CR/CRi patients relative to NR patients. 
- Exposure versus DOR 
There does not appear to be a difference in DOR for patients with an AUC R0-28dR or AUCR0-84dR greater than 
the median compared with patients with AUC R0-28dR or AUCR0-84dR less than the median. Based on the SCP 
Pool the risk of relapse does not appear to be impacted by AUC R0-84dR. The KM analysis of DOR by 
median of AUCR0 -28dR and AUCR0-84dR in study B2101J suggests that patients with low baseline tumour 
burden tend to have had more durable remission irrespective of exposure category, and patients with 
high tumour burden had less durable remission. The median DOR was not reached in patients with low 
tumour burden for patients with above or below median AUC0-28d. Among patients with high tumour 
burden, those who had AUC0-28d higher than the median appeared to have more durable remission 
(median DOR 15.7 months) compared to those who had AUC0-28d less than the median (median DOR 
3.8 months). The Cox regression analysis for study B2101J indicated limited impact of AUC0-84d on 
DOR after adjusting for tumour burden. AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d,and Cmax were approximately 307%, 
344%, and 208% higher in high tumour burden patients compared with low tumour burden patients 
(B2101J).

- Exposure versus B-cell recovery 
There was a trend for patients with AUC0-28d greater than the median to have slower B-cell recovery 
than in patients with lower AUC0-28d. Based on the Cox regression for Study B2202, the hazard ratio 
for a doubling in AUC0-28d was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.87). In Study B2202, the KM plot of time to B-
cell recovery by median of AUC0-28d indicated a separation between two curves. There were a limited 
number of patients with sufficient follow-up. The results based on Study B2205J were consistent with 
the expected pharmacodynamic on-target effect of tisagenlecleucel of causing B-cell aplasia. 
The KM analysis for the SCP Pool included a total of 85 patients. The median AUC0-28d was used in 
the analysis. B-cell recovery was the pharmacodynamic endpoint included in this analysis and defined 
as the earliest time when the percentage of CD19+ total B -cell among viable white blood cells is at 
least 1%. 
The relation between B-cell aplasia and tisagenlecleucel persistence was determined by an analysis of 
tisagenlecleucel transgene by B-cell recovery times (≤3 months, >3 months to ≤6 months, >6 
months). This analysis showed that patients with B-cell recovery occurring before 3 months or between 
3 and 6 months had more rapid loss of transgene compared with patients that had sustained B-cell 
aplasia beyond 6 months. 
Patients with CD19+ relapse have a rapid loss of transgene and limited expansion compared with 
patients that have sustained CR/CRi.  
- Cellular kinetics by CD19 status at time of relapse 
Patients with CD19 negative relapse have an absence of CD19 on the cell surface enabling the tumour 
to evade CAR T-mediated recognition and clearance despite having persistent transgene. This analysis 
showed the type of relapse (CD19 negative vs CD19 positive) will influence the persistence of 
transgene compared with patients that maintain CR/CRi status. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
Cytokine release syndrome was observed in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel. Higher transgene 
expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) was associated with increasing CRS grades based on logistic 
regression analysis and boxplots in Studies B2202, B2205J and the SCP Pool. Logistic regression 
analyses showed a higher probability of any grade CRS was associated with increasing expansion. 
Similarly, a higher probability of grade 3/4 and grade 4 only CRS was associated with increasing 
expansion. The odds ratio for having grade 3/4 CRS from the logistic regression model was 2.17 (95% 
CI: 1.402, 3.359) for Study B2202 for a doubling in Cmax. Analysis of CRS post tisagenlecleucel 
infusion by quartile of qPCR AUC0-28d revealed that a higher proportion of any grade CRS, grade 3/4 
and grade 4 events were associated with increasing tisagenlecleucel transgene expansion (Cmax and 
AUC0-28d). Tocilizumab or other anti-cytokine therapies were administered as per the CRS treatment 
algorithm to effectively manage CRS. Tocilizumab did not appear to impact the rate or extent of 
tisagenlecleucel transgene exposure. 
Neurological events were observed in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel; grade 1 and grade 2 
neurological events were observed in 28 patients (27%). Ten (9.6%) patients had grade 3 neurological 
events and only one (1.0%) had grade 4 neurological events. Logistic regression analysis showed an 
increased probability of ≥ grade 2 neurological events with increasing Cmax and AUC0-28d. 
Neurological events often occurred concurrently with CRS, therefore, the relationship between 
neurological events and increasing expansion is consistent with the relationship observed between 
expansion and CRS.

In the SCS pool, forty-eight (46.2%) patients had grade 3/4 low platelet count not resolved by Day 28. 
32 of the 48 patients (66.7%) had resolution to grade 2 or below after Day 28. The estimated 
probability of resolution by KM analysis among patients with grade 3/4 low platelet count at Day 28 
was 76.7% by Month 3 and 83.4% by Month 6. Thrombocytopenia events resolved within 3 months, 
independent of transgene levels. Similar findings were observed for the relationship between exposure 
and resolution of neutropenia, whereby, the majority of patients with neutropenia resolved within 3 
months, independent of the cellular kinetics (Cmax and AUC0-28d). Cox regression analysis was 
performed to evaluate the impact of AUC0 -28d on time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias 
which indicated that there was minimal influence of AUC0-28d on the time required to resolve 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia events. 
 
r/r DLBCL indication 
Rationale for the proposed dose specification 
The protocol specified dose range of 1.0×108 to 5.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells in the C2201 
study, was selected based on previous clinical experience from paediatric and young adult r/r B cell 
ALL and adult CLL studies according to the Applicant. In past and ongoing trials in r/r CLL (dose 
optimisation study CTL019A2201) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (study CTL019A2101J) 
patients, the upper range of the target dose tested (i.e., 5.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells) were 
effective and safe.  
The relationship between tisagenlecleucel dose and response (efficacy and safety) in DLBCL was 
explored using efficacy and safety analysis sets, respectively. Efficacy endpoints evaluated to assess 
the impact of dose on response, included response at month 3, duration of response (DOR), time to 
response, event free survival (EFS), and progression free survival (PFS). The efficacy analysis set (N = 
83) was used for these analyses. 
The impact of dose on the occurrence of cytokine release symptom (CRS), including any grade and 
grade 3/4, and neurological events and time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenia were also 
explored. Based on the exposure-safety, exposure-efficacy and dose response analysis, the following 
dose was recommended adult patients with relapsed and refractory DLBCL: 
The proposed dose specification range: 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Dose-response relationship – r/r DLBCL 
Dose versus efficacy 
Even if the protocol specified dose range in the CTL019C2201 study was 1.0 to 5.0×108 CAR-positive 
viable T cells, the doses administered ranged from 0.089 to 6.0×108 viable T cells, and responses were 
observed across the whole range. The manufacturing site always attempted to produce doses within 
the protocol specified range; however, in some cases doses lower or higher than the target dose were 
manufactured. Given the anticipated benefit in this patient population with high unmet needs, the 
doses below and above the protocol specified range were therefore infused. 
There were a total of five patients that received doses less than 1.0×108 cells, and out of these, two 
were responders. Five patients received doses greater than 5.0×108 cells, and out of these, also two 
patients were responders.  
Similar responses as for r/r DLBCL were observed across dose-quartiles in paediatric and young adult 
patients with r/r B-cell ALL. There was, however, an increasing trend of response with increase in dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at low doses (<1.0×108 cells). The dose-response curve reached a plateau at doses greater than 
1.0×108 CAR-positive viable cells. Therefore, the occurrence of a relatively flat dose-response curve for 
tisagenlecleucel is evident in both adult patients with r/r DLBCL and paediatric and young adult 
patients with r/r B-cell ALL according to the Applicant. 
Dose vs. month 3 response 
A logistic regression model was used to analyse the probability of response (CR and PR) at month 3 for 
patients in Study C2201.  
Across the wide range of dose administered, the logistic regression dose-response curve, for both 
rounded and unrounded doses, showed that there is no apparent impact of dose on response at month 
3. However, unrounded doses were used for proposed dose specification. The model estimate 
suggested that doubling in the dose was associated with 3% increase in the odds of a response 
(95%CI: 0.624, 1.685). 
Dose versus DOR/Time to response 
In Study C2201, the median dose was 3.1×108 CAR-positive viable T cells. The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
of duration of response (DOR, time from achievement of CR or PR to an event of PD or death due to 
DLBCL) for patients indicated a similar DOR in patients treated with doses greater (n=26) than and 
equal/less (n=18) than the median cell dose. There is, however, limited follow-up and number of 
events to make definitive assessment of impact of dose on DOR. Similarly, analysis by quartile of dose 
infused shows no difference in DOR among the quartiles of dose. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to 
response (time from infusion to first documented clinical response of CR or PR) by median cell dose 
was performed which indicated a similar time to response in patients treated with doses greater than 
and less than the median cell dose. 
Dose versus PFS/EFS 
Kaplan-Meier analyses for the relationship of dose-PFS and dose -EFS were performed on patients in 
the C2201 study.  
Dose versus safety 
Results from the C2201 study indicated that the probability of CRS increased with dose in adult 
patients with r/r DLBCL.  
CRS was generally manageable with the introduced CRS management algorithm and no death was 
attributed to CRS in adult patients with r/r DLBCL. Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox regression analyses on 
the relationship of dose-neurological events and dose-hematopoietic cytopenia suggested no apparent 
impact of dose on any grade or grade 3/4 neurologic events or time to resolution of hematopoietic 
cytopenia. The safety analysis set (N=99) was used for these analyses.  
Dose versus CRS 
According to the Applicant, given the high unmet need in this patient population with positive risk 
benefit ratio associated with tisagenlecleucel administration and no substantial increase in the 
probability of CRS from 5.0×108 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells, the upper range of the dose for 
commercial specification was proposed as 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells.  
Adult patients with r/r DLBCL treated with higher doses have an increased probability of all grades and 
grade 3/4 CRS. However, the frequency and severity of CRS observed in adult patients with r/r DLBCL

was lower than that in paediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL (23.3% patients with grade 3/4 CRS in 
Study C2201; and 48.4% patients with grade 3/4 CRS in Study B2202).

observed proportions (Safety analysis set)  
Dose versus neurological events and hematopoietic cytopenia 
Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of dose on neurological events, and 
also to explore the relationship between dose and time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias, 
including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
Exposure-response relationship 
The relationship between tisagenlecleucel exposure and response (efficacy and safety) in r/r DLBCL, 
was explored using the efficacy and safety analysis sets in study C2201, respectively. Efficacy 
endpoints evaluated to assess the impact of exposure on response included response at month 3, 
duration of response (DOR), time to response, event free survival (EFS), and progression free survival 
(PFS). Safety endpoints evaluated included, CRS grade, neurotoxicity grade and time to resolution of 
hematopoietic cytopenia. 
Exposure versus efficacy 
Efficacy analysis dataset (N = 83) was used for the exposure versus efficacy analyses to ensure each 
patient had achieved month 3 response. There was no apparent exposure-efficacy relationship 
observed. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between disease response 
versus exposure (e.g. AUC0- 84d based on qPCR, tisagenlecleucel transgene concentration measured 
by qPCR and concentration of CAR-positive viable T cells measured by flow cytometry at month 3). 
There was no relationship observed between exposure (AUC -84d or concentration) and month 3 
response. Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox Regression analyses performed to assess the impact of exposure 
efficacy endpoints (i.e. DOR, time to response, EFS, and PFS), suggested no apparent impact. 
Tisagenlecleucel showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant response for the primary 
endpoint in Study C2201.

Efficacy analysis dataset (N = 83) was used for these analyses to ensure each patient had achieved 
month 3 response. The subsequent sections describe the key analysis results. 
Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression and quartile analysis was planned to investigate the relationship between 
exposure and time to response. However, only four patients with cellular kinetic data available 
responded later than the Day 28 visit, so results of these analyses are not interpretable. 
Exposure versus PFS/EFS 
Kaplan-Meier analyses for the relationship of exposure-PFS and exposure-EFS were performed. The 
results suggested that exposure has no apparent impact on PFS and EFS. 
The PFS was grouped by AUC0-84d quartiles and concentration quartiles. The EFS was also grouped by 
AUC0-84d and concentration quartiles. The event free probability was similar across all quartiles at 
month 3 by AUC0 -84d quartiles (56.3% to 83.3%) and by concentration quartiles (70.1% to 81.8%). 
However, due to a rather small number of events, additional follow up is needed for a strong 
conclusion regarding this end-point. 
Exposure versus safety 
The exposure-safety analyses were conducted to evaluate the relation between tisagenlecleucel 
exposures and cytokine release syndrome grades. Similarly, the relation between tisagenlecleucel 
exposures and neurological events and hematopoietic cytopenia was also explored. The PK analysis set 
(N=99) was used for these analyses. 
Exposure versus CRS 
Logistic regression analysis evaluating the impact of tisagenlecleucel exposures on CRS indicated that 
a higher probability of any grade or grade 3/4 CRS was associated with higher tisagenlecleucel 
exposures. Patients with higher AUC0 -28d and Cmax showed higher probability of having CRS grade 3/4 
than patients with lower exposure. A similar exposure-CRS relationship was also observed in paediatric 
and young adult r/r B-cell ALL. Two cellular kinetic parameters, AUC0-28d and Cmax, were selected for 
the analysis because CRS is generally resolved within seven days of the tisagenlecleucel infusion and 
these parameters are useful for characterising expansion. 
The relation between expansion and CRS grade was explored for both adult patients with r/r DLBCL 
and paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL, based on data from Study B2202 with data 
cut-off date of 17 August 2016, to investigate any indication-specific differences in the exposure-safety 
(CRS) relationship. The results showed that the trend of higher expansion associated with higher 
severity of CRS was consistent for both indications, despite lower expansion in the adult patients with 
r/r DLBCL as compared to paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL.  
These results further explains the lower proportion of patients with higher grades of CRS in r/r DLBCL 
(23.3% patients with grade 3/4 CRS) indication relative to paediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL 
(46.6% patients with grade 3/4 CRS), based on the updated data with data cut-off date of 25 April 
2017.  
A scatter plot of onset time of CRS versus Tmax and Cmax showed no impact of time and extent of in 
vivo expansion (Cmax and Tmax) on the onset time of CRS. Correlation between the time for maximal 
expansion of tisagenlecleucel (Tmax) and the CRS grade categories and time for the onset of CRS 
showed no impact on Tmax on severity of CRS events.

With increasing exposure (AUC0-28d and Cmax), no increase in the probability of any grade or grade 3/4 
neurological events was observed. In addition, no definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding 
prolonged cytopenia and exposure, due to limited number of patients with this adverse effect. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based data from paediatric/young adult ALL patients (B2202, B2205J), the tisagenlecleucel cellular 
kinetic profile showed an initial rapid expansion phase achieving maximal expansion around Day 10 
followed by a slower bi-exponential decline in responding (CR/CRi) patients based on Day 28 response. 
Cmax and AUC0-28d were 67.7% and 43% higher respectively in CR/CRi patients relative to NR 
patients, and a slower median Tmax (20 vs. ~10 days) and shorter median persistence (Tlast 28.9 vs. 
170 days) were observed in NR patients vs. responders. Comparable findings were observed in study 
B2101J. Regression and modelling analysis of exposure parameters suggested that AUC0-28d was 
proportional to Cmax), thus those covariates that affect Cmax may also impact the AUC0-28d. 
Tisagenlecleucel transgene persistence was also demonstrated in bone marrow of responders for the 
complete sampling period of six months. 
Cellular kinetic data from adult r/r DLBCL patients (C2201) showed a rapid expansion after infusion of 
tisagenlecleucel with maximal expansion around day 9, followed by a bi-exponential decline with 
median persistence (Tlast) of 87 days (range 21.9 to 367 days). The geometric mean Cmax, AUC0-28d 
and AUC0-84d in CR/PR patients was similar to that in non-responding patients based on clinical 
response at Month 3. Also, time to Cmax was similar. A longer mean persistence was observed in 
responders vs. non-responders with median Tlast of 180 vs. 59.9, respectively, however the follow up 
period was not similar in the two populations. The results indicate a high extent of bone marrow 
penetration, however there are limited data from non-responders. 
When comparing cellular kinetic parameters between the two proposed indications, the geometric 
mean estimates of Cmax and AUC0-28d in responding adult patients (CR/PR) with r/r DLBCL were 
nearly 80-84% lower compared to responding paediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL patients 
(CR/CRi). This is potentially due to differences in primary location of the disease; in DLBCL the 
tisagenlecleucel target is mainly in the lymph tissue, whereas ALL cancer cells is found primarily in 
peripheral blood. A faster expansion was observed in the responding ALL patients vs. responding 
DLBCL patients (median Tmax ~10 vs. 20 days), while Tlast were comparable between indications. 
Inter-individual variability in cellular kinetic parameters was high, indicating that numerous factors 
could impact on the expansion of tisagenlecleucel. Both Tlast and T1/2 are dependent on the time of 
data cut off (data not shown). Persistence in blood will be measured up to month 60 irrespective of 
disease progression. The CHMP recommended that after study completions, additional data will be 
available and should be provided for determination of these parameters and for further analysis of 
impact of CRS co-medications on persistence. 
The data, although limited, did not indicate that the site of manufacturing affected cellular kinetics. 
No apparent dose-exposure relationship was detected (data not shown). This is not unexpected 
considering the MoA of tisagenlecleucel which includes the capacity of tisagenlecleucel to proliferate in 
vivo. 
Overall, similar findings of the impact of available intrinsic and extrinsic factors were observed between 
ALL and DLBCL populations. The intrinsic and extrinsic factors were not found to impact on cellular 
kinetics with the exception of co-medications administered to manage CRS (ALL, DLBCL) and pre-

infusion tumour burden (ALL). In the ALL SPC pool, responding patients treated with tocilizumab 
(N=22) to manage CRS had approximately 333% and 220% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax, respectively, 
compared with responding patients that did not receive tocilizumab (N=58). CR/CRi patients that 
received corticosteroids (N=35) had 68% higher AUC0-28d and comparable Cmax and Tmax vs. 
CR/CRi patients that did not receive corticosteroids (N=45). The administration of tocilizumab or 
corticosteroid was required for management of severe CRS; these patients often had higher expansion. 
The higher transgene expansion in these patients might also be attributed to a higher baseline tumour 
burden. AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d and Cmax were approximately 307%, 344%, and 208% higher in high 
tumour burden patients compared with low tumour burden patients (B2101J). Similar as for the ALL 
indication, exposure in DLBCL patients (C2201) was higher in patients experiencing grade 3-4 CRS 
(approximately 3-4 fold higher), which also correlated with tocilizumab co-medication.  
In general, variability of cellular kinetic parameters were very high and several of the investigated 
subpopulations were small which hampers interpretations of findings. The high variability is expected 
considering the type of the medicinal product.  
Although it overall appears that there is no impact of age on cellular kinetics, data showed that 
children <18 years of age have up to 1.8 fold higher Cmax and AUC0-28d as compared to adults 
(ALL).  
The scatter plots of cellular kinetic parameters versus age (22-76 years) revealed no relevant 
relationship between cellular kinetic parameters (AUC0 28d and Cmax) with age (SmPC, section 5.2). 
There is limited evidence that race/ethnicity impact the expansion of Kymriah in paediatric and young 
adult ALL and DLBCL patients. In Studies B2202 and B2205J there were 79.8% Caucasian, 7.7% Asian 
and 12.5% other ethnic patients. In Study C2201 there were 88% Caucasian, 5% Asian, 4% Black or 
African American patients, and 3 patients (3%) of unknown race (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Gender is not a significant characteristic influencing tisagenlecleucel expansion in B cell ALL and DLBCL 
patients (SmPC, section 5.2). 
The CHMP recommended the applicant to investigate the cellular kinetic parameters including 
transgene persistence and the impact of covariates on cellular kinetics, following completion of studies 
B2202, B2205J, and C2201. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics and exposure responses have been generally well characterised. 
Therefore, the current application for tisagenlecleucel in ALL and DLBCL is acceptable from clinical 
pharmacology point of view. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the clinical pharmacology as 
described above.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
  ALL indication 
Dosage was based on pre-clinical studies and results of Phase I/ IIA CTL019B2101J trial where 20 
paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients received only a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel due to

Since the experience with higher doses is study CTL019B2101J is limited, a cut off of 2.5×10 P
8
P cells as 
a maximum dose, based upon a weight >50 kg, was proposed to avoid any potential safety issues. 
Additional experience of dosage comes from study CTL019B2102J, a Phase II CLL trial where the dose 
was given as a single infusion of 1.0 to 5.0×10 P

tisagenlecleucel transduced cell numbers infused have ranged from 1.4×10 P

P to 1.1×10P
P cells. 
  DLBCL indication 
In DLBCL, the relationship between dose and efficacy endpoints (months 3 response, time to response 
PFS and EFS) were investigated, where no apparent impact of dose of any of the studied efficacy 
endpoint was observed. Increasing dose was associated with increased probability of CRS with no 
higher grade CRS observed with doses lower than 2.4×10 P
8
P CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Logistic regression for dose-safety relationship showed that the probability for CRS any grade or grade 
3/4 increased with higher doses in adult patients with r/r DLBCL.  
The true influence of tocilizumab on expansion cannot be ascertained directly. This observation may 
have been confounded as tocilizumab is given for high grade CRS and high grade CRS is correlated to 
higher doses and exposure.

expansion. If such an agent had been administered within 8 weeks prior to 
tisagenlecleucel, the Sponsor had to be contacted, consultation with an pharmacology 
expert was considered, and measuring residual drug levels was considered, if feasible, 
prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion.

for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. have had no menses) or have undergone 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy) are eligible without 
requiring the use of contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women must be stable 
on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment 
12. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. NOTE: female study participants of reproductive 
potential had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before 
infusion 
13. Active CNS involvement by malignancy, defined as CNS3 per National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines. Note: Patients with history of CNS disease that has been effectively 
treated were eligible 
Prior to CTL019 infusion the following criteria must be met: 
1. Influenza Testing test within 10 days prior to the CTL019 infusion. If positive, complete a full course 
of oseltamivir phosphate or zanamivir.  
2. Performance Status: Patient should not experience a significant change in clinical or performance 
status compared to initial eligibility criteria that would increase the risk of adverse events associated

5. Chemotherapy Toxicity: Patients experiencing toxicities from their preceding lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy will have infusion schedule delayed until toxicities have been resolved (to grade 1 or 
baseline). The specific toxicities warranting delay of CTL019 cell infusion include: 
a. Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater than 91% or presence 
of progressive radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray 
b. Cardiac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management. Preinfusion ECG also 
required  
c. Hypotension: requiring vasopressor support 
6. Infection: CTL019 infusion must be delayed if there is an uncontrolled active infection, as evidenced 
by positive blood cultures for bacteria, fungus, or PCR positivity for viral DNA within 72 hours of 
CTL019 cell infusion. 
Treatments 
The study included a screening period including leukapheresis, enrolment, a conditioning 
chemotherapy period, an IMP treatment period, a primary and a secondary post treatment assessment 
and a long term-follow up period (see Figure 11). 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy: fluarabine (30mg/m2 IV daily for 4 doses)+ cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 IV daily for 2 doses) 
Figure 7 Study design B2202 (and Study B2205J) 
Leukapheresis: Leukapheresis was performed as per study protocol or per local institutional guidelines. 
Bridging chemotherapy: Bridging chemotherapy was allowed pr Investigator choice. 
Lymphodepletion (LD): Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, a LD chemotherapy cycle was planned. 
Cyclophosphamide-based regimens were the agents of choice and the LD regimen consisted of: 
 
Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 iv daily for 4 doses) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 
doses starting with the first dose of fludarabine) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the patient had a previous grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or the patient 
demonstrated a chemorefractory state to a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen administered shortly 
before LD chemotherapy, then the following was used: 
  Cytarabine (500 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 days) and etoposide (150 mg/m2 iv daily for 3 days 
starting with the first dose of cytarabine) 
If patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count ≤ 1,000 cells/μL within one week prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, LD chemotherapy was not required. 
Tisagenlecleucel infusion: Investigational treatment for paediatric and young adult patients consisted 
of a single iv infusion with a target dose range of 2.0 to 5.0×106 tisagenlecleucel cells (i.e. CAR-
positive viable T-cells) per kg body weight (for patients ≤ 50 kg) or of 1.0 to 2.5×108 tisagenlecleucel 
cells (for patients >50 kg). 
The following cell dose ranges were allowed if all other safety release criteria were met: 
 
 
Patients ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5.0×106 CAR-positive viable T-cells per kg body weight 
Patients >50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells 
The released tisagenlecleucel dose is reported as CAR-positive viable T-cells for patients >50 kg and as 
CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg body weight for patients less or equal to 50 kg. Numerical rounding of 
the dose was performed by the manufacturing site. 
Products falling below the minimum values in the above allowable cell dose ranges (i.e. 0.2×106 CAR-
positive viable T-cells per kg or 1.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells) were not released for infusion. 
The tisagenlecleucel dose was administered via a single iv infusion. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as measured by overall 
remission rate (ORR), which included complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi) as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment, within 3 months 
after tisagenlecleucel administration. 
Key secondary objectives included the following: 
  Evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy from US manufacturing facility as measured 
by ORR during the 3 months after tisagenlecleucel administration, which includes CR and CRi 
as determined by IRC assessment. 
  Evaluate the percentage of patients who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of CR or CRi 
with a MRD negative bone marrow by central analysis using flow cytometry among all patients 
who received tisagenlecleucel from all manufacturing facilities. 
  Evaluate the percentage of patients who achieved a BOR of CR or CRi with a MRD negative 
bone marrow by central analysis using flow cytometry among all patients who receive 
tisagenlecleucel from US manufacturing facility.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Overall remission rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall disease response of 
CR or CRi, where the best overall disease response is defined as the best disease response recorded 
from tisagenlecleucel infusion until the start of new anticancer therapy. Remission status was required 
to be maintained for at least 28 days without clinical evidence of relapse. 
Best response was to be assigned according to the following order: − CR; − CRi ; No response (NR): 
no evidence of a response; Unknown: patients who did not have an evaluation for CR or CRi in 
compliance with the guidelines.

Sample size 
In a study of clofarabine in patients with r/r B-cell ALL who have had 2 or more prior regimens, the 
reported ORR was 20% (95% CI [10%, 34%] [25]. Hence, an ORR of 45% that excludes a 20% ORR 
at the 0.025 significance level could indicate meaningful efficacy in this highly refractory population. 
The final analysis of the primary endpoint was to be performed after all patients infused with CTL019 
completed 3 months follow-up from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. The sample size for 
the final analysis of the primary endpoint was up to 76 patients. 
Based on the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 20% and alternative hypothesis of ORR >20%, 76 patients in 
the FAS would provide more than 95% power to demonstrate statistical significance at one-sided 
Assessment report

cumulative 0.025 level of significance, if the underlying ORR is 45% and taking into account the 
interim analysis. In this setting, an ORR of 23/76=30% was be needed to claim success. 
Within the expected sample size of 76 patients with CTL019, at least 10 patients were to be treated 
with CTL019 manufactured by the Fraunhofer Institute. If there were at least 6 patients among them 
who achieved best overall response of CR or CRi, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval 
would be higher than 20%. The probability of observing at least 6 CR or CRi among the 10 patients 
would be 26% if the true ORR is 45%, and would be 84% if the true ORR is 70%. 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed by testing whether the ORR within 3 months is greater 
than 20% at overall one-sided 2.5% level of significance, i.e., H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p >0.2. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, ORR within 3 months, was analysed at the interim look and final look 
following a group sequential design. The ORR was summarized along with the 2-sided exact Clopper-
Pearson confidence intervals (CI) with coverage level determined by the O’Brien-Fleming type α-
spending approach according to Lan-DeMets as implemented in East 6.3. The study was considered 
successful if the lower bound of the 2-sided exact confidence interval for ORR was greater than 20%, 
so that the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 20% could be rejected. 
An interim analysis was planned when the first 50 patients infused have completed 3 months from 
study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. The interim analysis was performed by testing the null 
hypothesis of ORR within 3 months being less than or equal to 20% against the alternative hypothesis 
of ORR within 3 months being greater than 20% at overall one sided 2.5% level of significance. 
The study was not planned to be stopped for outstanding efficacy at the interim analysis regardless of 
the interim result. 
An α-spending function according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming), as implemented in East 6.3, was 
used to construct the efficacy stopping boundaries (Lan and DeMets 1983). At the time of this interim 
analysis, assessment of all endpoints was based only on patients who receive CTL019 manufactured 
from US manufacturing facility because there was no patients treated with CTL019 manufactured from 
other manufacturing facilities. 
In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed using the local investigator’s response assessment 
instead of the IRC’s assessment. 
The efficacy boundary at the final analysis was based on the actual number of patients and the alpha 
already spent at the interim analysis. If the number of patients in the final analysis deviated from the 
expected number of patients, the final analysis criteria would have been determined so that the overall 
significance level across all analyses was maintained at one-sided 0.025.

The final analysis of the primary endpoint was to be performed after all patients infused with CTL019 
have completed 3 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. 
Analysis tests 
The Screened set comprised of all patients who had signed informed consent/assent and were 
screened in the study. 
The Enrolled set comprised all patients who were enrolled in the study. Enrolment date was defined as 
the point at which the patient met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the patients’ leukapheresis 
product was received and accepted by the manufacturing facility. 
The Full analysis set (FAS) comprised all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel. 
The Interim efficacy analysis set (IEAS) comprised the first 50 patients who received tisagenlecleucel 
infusion (used for the interim analysis). 
The Safety set comprised all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel. 
The Per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of a subset of the patients in the FAS who were compliant with 
major requirements of the clinical study protocol.  
The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) consisted of a subset of FAS who had at least one sample 
providing evaluable PK data. 
The Tocilizumab Pharmacokinetic Analysis set (TPAS) consisted of patients in FAS who had taken at 
least one dose of tocilizumab and provided at least one tocilizumab PK concentration.

Recruitment 
Study B2202 enrolled and treated paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL in 25 in 
investigative centres across US, EU, Canada, Australia, and Japan. 
Study initiation date was 8 April 2015 (first patient first visit). Data cut-off date for the primary 
analysis was 25 April 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended 5 times. These amendments were minor to the overall study design 
(data not shown).  
Protocol deviations 
Seven patients were excluded from the PPS, one due to a major protocol deviation related to missing 
or incomplete documentation of disease at Baseline (i.e. for Patient B2202-1406003 the CNS 
classification could not be obtained at enrollment due to failed attempt of lumbar puncture). Six 
patients were excluded from the PPS due to tisagenlecleucel viable T-cells received were less than the 
minimum target dose. 
Protocol deviations were reported by 22 patients (29.3%) with the majority being minor. The most 
common protocol deviations were related to cardiac evaluation either cardiac safety entry criteria not 
met prior to enrollment (in five patients), or the patient had a screening cardiac evaluation >6 weeks 
at pre-infusion but was not repeated (in five patients). Good clinical practice deviations were reported 
(in four patients) due to source documentation issues; one was related to biomarker sample collection 
time, one due to missing infusion form, one due to Investigator failed to review PedsQL for AEs and 
one was a missing PedsQL source documentation. Missing or incomplete documentation of disease 
post-baseline was reported and written informed consent not obtained prior to screening procedures 
were reported in four patients each. Other minor protocol deviations were reported in only one more 
patient.

Secondary endpoint-Bone marrow MRD status during 3 months by IRC assessment at interim analysis 
Forty-one patients of the first 50 treated patients (82.0%, 95% CI: 68.6, 91.4; p<0.0001) achieved 
BOR of CR or CRi per IRC assessment during 3 months post-tisagenlecleucel infusion with bone. All 
patients who achieved BOR also achieved bone marrow MRD negative remission (data not shown).

Secondary endpoint-Duration of remission 
Seventeen of the 61 patients (27.9%) who achieved a CR or CRi relapsed after tisagenlecleucel per 
IRC review. The relapses occurred between 48 and 269 days after onset of remission. Responses were 
ongoing and censored at data cut-off date in 30 patients. Fourteen more patients were censored for 
DOR as follows: 7 patients for SCT while in remission, 6 patients for new cancer therapy while in 
remission other than SCT (4 humanized CD19 CAR-T cells, one received vincristine sulfate and 
blinatumomab, and one received ponatinib), one patient for adequate assessment no longer available. 
The estimated relapse-free rate among responders at Month 6 after onset of remission was 79.5% 
(data not shown). 
Secondary endpoint-Relapse-free survival  
Among patients with a BOR of CR or CRi, there was no due to reasons other than the underlying 
cancer, and thus RFS was the same as DOR (data not shown). 
Secondary endpoint-Overall survival  
In the FAS, 19/75 patients (25.3%) died after tisagenlecleucel infusion and the probability of 
survival was 90.3% (95% CI: 80.7 to 95.3) at Month 6 and 76.4% (95% CI: 62.7 to 85.5) at 
Month 12. The KM plot of OS in the FAS is shown below.

Secondary endpoint-Quality of Life outcomes 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated by PedsQL and EQ-5D questionnaires completed 
by patients aged 8 years and above (n=58). Among patients responding (n=48), the mean (SD) 
change from baseline in the PedsQL total score was 13.5 (13.5) at month 3, 16.9 (17.6) at month 6 
and 27.2 (21.7) at month 12, and the mean (SD) change from baseline in the EQ-5D VAS score was 
16.5 (17.5) at month 3, 15.9 (20.1) at month 6 and 24.7 (18.6) at month 12, indicating overall 
clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL following Kymriah infusion (SmPC, section 5.1).

Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy in patients infused with tisagenlecleucel from the EU manufacturing facility 
For the 12 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel from the EU manufacturing facility, the ORR during 3 
months per IRC assessment was 75.0% (9/12) (95% CI: 42.8, 94.5). Five patients (41.7%) achieved 
BOR of CR and four (33.3%) achieved BOR of CRi during 3 months post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. Two 
patients had unknown response: one patient did not have CSF assessment and for the other patient 
site considered the response as CRi however IRC determined the response as unknown as there was 
no differential count available and the patient’s bone marrow biopsy and aspirate showed aplasia. All 
nine patients who achieved BOR as CR or CRi also achieved bone marrow MRD negative remission. Of 
the 9 patients who achieved remission, responses were ongoing in eight patients and for one patient 
the duration of remission was 64 days. As of the data cut-off date of 25 April 2017, all 12 patients 
were alive. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present

paediatric patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  
Study identifier 
CCTL019B2202 (B2202), EudraCT no. 2013-003205-25  
Design 
global, multicentre, single-arm, open-label Phase II study  
Duration of main phase: 
The duration of the study for individual 
subjects varied depending on their response. 
For a subject who remained in response and 
completed the entire protocol from the date 
of informed consent through the completion 
(5 years) and subsequently entered the  
long-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol 
(A2205B), the total follow-up  duration was 
planned to be up to 15 years. 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
The primary efficacy analysis in patients with ALL was performed by testing 
the null hypothesis of ORR being less than or equal to 20% against the 
alternative hypothesis that the RR was > 20% at an overall one-sided 2.5% 
level of significance, powered for an ORR of 45%.

Not applicable. 
Supportive studies 
Study B2205J enrolled 35 paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL with a median age of 
12 years (range: 3 to 25 years. Twenty-nine patients were infused with tisagenlecleucel. All infused 
patients had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 50%, and included high risk cytogenetics, 
following a median of 3 prior therapies (range: 1 to 9), of which 58.6% of patients had failed prior 
allogeneic SCT. The study also included patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukaemia 
involvement defined as CNS3. Patients with other forms of CNS3 leukemic involvement (non-CSF 
involvement) were eligible if disease stabilization for at least 3 months prior to tisagenlecleucel 
infusion. Patients with other forms of active CNS3 leukemic involvement such as CNS parenchymal or 
ocular disease, cranial nerve involvement or significant leptomeningeal disease were not eligible.  
Study B2101J was a single-arm, single-site phase I/II study in 56 paediatric and young adult patients 
1 to 24 years of age with CD19+ B cell malignancies with no available curative treatment options (such 
as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who had limited prognosis (several months to 
<2 year survival) with currently available therapies. Tisagenlecleucel treatment was administered 
using an intra-patient dose escalation approach: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1, possibly followed by 
60% on day 14 (or later) with a total dose goal of ~1.5 x107 to 5 x109 (~0.3x106 to 1.0x108/kg) T 
cells. 
Of four patients with active CNS leukaemia (i.e. CNS-3) included in study B2101J, three experienced 
cytokine release syndrome (Grade 2-4) and transient neurological abnormalities (Grade 1-3) that 
resolved within 1-3 months of infusion. One patient died due to disease progression and the remaining 
three patients achieved a CR or CRi and remain alive 1.5-2 years after infusion.

Figure 11: Study periods for Study C2201 
Patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment upon confirmation of all clinical eligibility criteria by 
the investigator and acceptance of the leukapheresis product for manufacturing. 
Conditioning  lymphodepleting  (LD):  After  apheresis,  14  to  5  days  prior  to  tisagenlecleucel  infusion, 
subjects  received  a  3-day-cycle  of  conditioning  lymphodepleting  (LD)  chemotherapy  consisting  of 
2
fludarabine (25 mg/mP
P intravenous daily for 3 doses) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m P
2
P intravenous 
daily  for  3  doses  starting  with  the  first  dose  of  fludarabine).  The  cyclophosphamide-based  regimens 
was  the  agents  of  choice  for  LD  chemotherapy  since  there  is  most  experience  with  the  use  of  these 
agents in facilitating adoptive immunotherapy. However, if there was previous grade IV  haemorrhagic 
cystitis  or  the  patient  demonstrated  resistance  to  a  previous  cyclophosphamide-containing  regimen, 
then bendamustine 90 mg/m P
2
P intravenous daily for 2 days was recommended to be used. For patients 
who  had  a  WBC  count  ≤  1000  cells/µL  within  one  week  prior  to  tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  LD 
chemotherapy  was  not  required.  Patients  who  experienced  toxicities 
from  their  preceding 
chemotherapy  had  their  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  delayed.  In  case  a  period  of  delay  was  4  or  more 
weeks from completing LD chemotherapy and the WBC>1000/μL, the patient had to be re-treated with 
LD chemotherapy. 
The tisagenlecleucel product was intended to be prepared and released by the manufacturing facility to 
the study site approximately 4-5 weeks after manufacturing has commenced. 
Premedication: All patients was pre-medicated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and diphenhydramine 
or another H1-antihistamine. These medications was repeated every 6 hours as needed. Non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  medications  (NSAIDs)  were  prescribed  if  the  patient  continued  to  have  fever  not 
relieved  with  acetaminophen/paracetamol.  Steroids  should  not  be  used  for  premedication.  Infusions 
were  performed  2  to  14  days  after  completion  of  LD  chemotherapy.  The  targeted  dose  of 
tisagenlecleucel  for  adult  patients  consisted  of  a  single  infusion  of  5.0×10 P
8
P  viable  tisagenlecleucel 
transduced  cells,  which  were  administered  via  intravenous  infusion.  The  acceptable  dose  range  was 
considered  as  1.0×10P

P  to  5.0×10P
8
P  viable  tisagenlecleucel  transduced  cells.  Prior  to  protocol 
amendment 4, doses between 0.5 to 1.0×10 P

8
P cells were no longer released for infusion. However, for 
patients with manufactured cell numbers falling below the above specified recommended dose ranges, 
tisagenlecleucel therapy may have been administered. 
Bridging  chemotherapy/Concomitant  medication:  After  signing  the  informed  consent,  patients  were 
allowed to receive bridging therapies if required for stabilization of patient’s disease while waiting for 
tisagenlecleucel manufacturing and infusion. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  tisagenlecleucel  therapy  in  the  Main  Cohort  (i.e.,  patients  treated  with 
tisagenlecleucel  manufactured  at  the  Novartis  manufacturing  facility  in  Morris  Plains,  United  States 
(US), referred to as “US manufacturing facility”) as measured by the overall response rate (ORR). ORR 
was  based  on  the  Lugano  Classification  [26]  assessed  by  a  central  independent  review  committee 
(IRC). 
Secondary objectives 
The  main  secondary  objectives  were  evaluate  safety  of  tisagenlecleucel,  time-to-response  (TTR), 
duration of overall response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS) and efficacy and safety in histological and molecular subgroups. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the ORR as determined centrally by IRC assessment. The ORR was defined 
as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  CR  and  PR  based  on  the  Lugano  Classification  criteria  [26] 
interpreted by Novartis own Image guideline. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a 
BOR  of  CR  or  PR,  where  the  BOR  was  defined  as  the  best  disease  response  recorded  from 
tisagenlecleucel  until  PD  or  start  of  new  anticancer  therapy.  The  results  of  central  evaluations  were 
used  for  primary  analysis,  and  local  investigator  assessments  were  used  for  treatment  decision 
making. 
The  efficacy  evaluation  was  based  on  recommendations  by  the  International  Malignant  Lymphomas 
Imaging Working Group [26], [27]). Efficacy of tisagenlecleucel was assessed at Day 28 (±7 days) and 
at  3,  6,  9,  12,  18,  24  months  (±14  days)  and  then  every  12  months  for  5  years  until  documented 
disease relapse or disease progression. 
A positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) (or CT/MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG)-PET  when  PET-CT  were  not  available)  was  performed  for  disease  assessments  based  on  the 
Lugano classification within four weeks prior  to scheduled infusion of the tisagenlecleucel product but 
prior  to  start  of  LD  therapy  and  3  months  post-infusion,  only.  Response  assessment  at  a  given  visit 
was  based  on  the  three  components  of  the  assessment:  PET  score  and  PET-CT  based  time  point 
response  assessment,  CT  based  time  point  response  assessment  and  integration  of  PET-CT  based 
assessment,  and  CT  based  assessment  to  give  overall  response.  CT/MRI  scan  was  performed  at 
baseline  and/or  3  months  (if  no  PET-CT  was  available)  and  at  the  other  pre-defined  time  points 
(specified above) for efficacy assessment. 
Secondary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 83 
 
 
 
 
 
IRC  assessment  were  used  in  the  main  analysis  of  secondary  endpoints  that  involved  the  disease 
response. The most important secondary endpoints were TTR, DOR, EFS, PFS, OS and safety. 
Sample size 
Based on the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 20% and alternative hypothesis of ORR >20%, 80 patients in 
the primary analysis would provide 94% cumulative power to demonstrate statistical significance, 
using a 2-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary and an exact 
CI at one-sided cumulative 0.025 level of significance, if the underlying ORR was 38%. In this setting, 
an ORR of 24/80=30% was needed to claim success. The sample size was appropriate to demonstrate 
a statistically significant result in the primary analysis. 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed by testing the null hypothesis of ORR being less than or 
equal to 20% against the alternative hypothesis that ORR is greater than 20% at overall one-sided 
2.5% level of significance, i.e., H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p>0.2 
The ORR was summarized along with the 2-sided 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. 
Taking into account the interim analysis, the study was considered successful if the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95.28% exact confidence interval for ORR was greater than 20%, so that the null hypothesis 
that the ORR is less or equal to 20% could be rejected.  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of CTL019 therapy as measured by 
overall response rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as 
determined by IRC assessment in the FAS in main cohort (patients treated with CTL019 from US 
manufacturing facility). 
The study was ongoing at the time of interim analysis and primary analysis, when 50 and 80 patients 
respectively from main cohort had 3 month follow-up or discontinued earlier. Therefore EAS was used 
to assess the primary endpoint to these milestones to ensure that patients included in the analysis had 
the opportunity to be followed-up for 3 months. FAS will be used for the final update of the primary 
endpoint after all infused patients in the main cohort have been followed 3 months or discontinued 
earlier. 
In addition, sensitivity analyses were to be performed using the local investigator response 
assessments instead of the IRC assessment.

Table 22: Overall patient disposition (Enrolled set) 
Among  the  99  patients  who  received  tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  92  received  infusion  from  the  US 
manufacturing  facility  (Main  Cohort)  and  seven  received  infusion  from  the  EU  manufacturing  facility 
(Cohort  A).  A  total of  83 patients  were infused  at  least  3  months  (90  days) prior  to  the data  cut-off 
date, 81 in the Main Cohort and two in Cohort A. Among the 81 patients with at least 3 months follow-
up, 46 patients had ≥ 6 months follow-up, 24 patients had ≥ 9 months follow-up and nine patients had 
≥  12  months  follow-up.  The  median  times  from  screening  and  enrolment  to  tisagenlecleucel  infusion 
were 119 days (range: 49 to 396) and 54 days (range: 30 to 357), respectively, and the median time 
from tisagenlecleucel infusion to data cut-off date was 5.6 months (range: 0.0 to 17.1). 
Of  the  217  screened  patients,  165  patients  fulfilled  the  eligibility  criteria,  147  patients  were  enrolled 
and  99  patients  were  infused.  Thus,  there  is  a  large  difference  between  the  numbers  of  screened, 
eligible, enrolled and infused patients. 
Recruitment 
Study initiation date was 29-Jul-2015 (first patient first visit). Data cut-off (DCO) date for the primary 
analysis was 08-Mar-2017 (the study is ongoing). The main contributing country in study C2201 were 
USA (12 centres), but a significant number of European centres (7 centres) also recruited patients into 
the study. Additional follow-up data from the study were provided with a data cut-off of 06-Sep-2017. 
Conduct of the study 
There were four global amendments over the course of the study and before the data cut-off date for 
the primary analysis (08/03/2017). Amendment 1 added an interim analysis (IA) when approximately

50 DLBCL patients had been treated and followed up for 6 months. Based on the α-spending function 
according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming), if the lower bound of 99.08% exact confidence interval for 
ORR was greater than 20% then statistical significance could be declared. If the predicted probability 
of success (i.e, positive result at the end of the study) was less than 10% then the study may be 
terminated due to futility. This amendment also added a safety run-in stage -to enrol at least 3 
patients to assess the acute safety profile and product characteristics of the Novartis manufactured 
tisagenlecleucel cell product- and modified the inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure a homogenous 
population. Allogeneic HSCT were removed from inclusion criteria. The exclusion of patients with T cell 
rich/histiocyte rich large B-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous DLBCL, primary mediastinal B-cell 
lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL of the elderly, Richter’s transformation, and Burkitt 
lymphoma were introduced in protocol amendment 2 along with a redefinition of the term of final 
enrolment. Furthermore, the decision to prohibit release of tisagenlecleucel doses lower than the 
protocol specified range was introduced in protocol amendment 4. 
Protocol  deviations  were  reported  on  48  patients  in  the  Main  Cohort  (59.3%)  in  the  EAS  and  57 
patients (57.6%) in the FAS with the majority being considered minor deviations. There was one major 
protocol deviation for a patient who had single lung lesion thought to be progression of DLBCL and was 
enrolled based on central confirmation of DLBCL from an archival tumour sample; however, based on a 
subsequent  biopsy  done  after  relapse,  this  patient  was  determined  by  the  Investigator  to  have  had 
neuroendocrine carcinoma at the time of study entry rather than DLBCL. 
The  most  common  protocol  deviations  fell  into  the  following  categories:  Assessments  not  being 
repeated before tisagenlecleucel infusion as per protocol requirements;  
Signed written informed 
consent  not  obtained  prior  to  any  study  procedures  ;  GCP  not  followed  (GCP  deviations  (16  in  total) 
were  mostly  (n=13)  related  to  late  reporting  of  SAEs  (more  than  24  hours)  to  the  Novartis  Safety 
Department. These SAEs were all ultimately captured in the database);  
Patients were not dosed 
as  per  protocol  requirements  (doses  above  or  below  dosing  range);  Response  assessments  were  not 
performed  as  described  in  the  protocol;  Testing  for  influenza  was  not  done  10  days  prior  to  planned 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Baseline data 
UBaseline data 
The  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  representative  of  the  r/r  DLBCL  patient 
population as defined by the protocol criteria (see Table 27).

UBridging chemotherapy and Lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
Among  the  99  patients  who  received  tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  89  patients  (90%)  had  received 
antineoplastic therapy after enrollment and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most frequently used 
(≥ 15% of patients) bridging therapies were rituximab (54.5%), gemcitabine (38.4%), dexamethasone 
(25.3%), etoposide (22.2%), cytarabine (19.2%), cisplatin (18.2%), and cyclophosphamide (15.2%). 
Among  the  99  patients  who  received  tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  92  (92.9%)  patients  received  LD 
chemotherapy after enrolment and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
With the updated cut off in Study C2201, 165 patients were enrolled, 111 of whom were infused (93 
patients in the Main Cohort and 18 patients in Cohort A).

The  Full  Analysis  set  (FAS)  and  Safety  set  consisted  of  99  patients,  and  the  first  83  infused  patients 
were  included  in  the  Efficacy  Analysis  set  (EAS)  (81  patients  in  the  Main  Cohort  and  two  patients  in 
Cohort A; those 81 patients who received tisagenlecleucel infusion from the US manufacturing facility 
and at least 3 months prior to data cut-off were included in the efficacy analysis set (EAS), which was 
the primary analysis population. In total, 80 patients were included in the per-protocol set (PPS).

Table 27: Analysis sets 
At the data cut-off for the additional follow-up analysis (DCO: 06-Sep-2017), 160 patients were 
enrolled in study C2201 and 106 patients were infused with tisagenlecleucel (+7 patients compared to 
the primary analysis), and included in the full analysis set (FAS). In total were 92 patients followed-up 
for longer than 3 months and therefore included in the EAS for this update analysis (an additional 11 
patients compared to the primary analysis).  
At a further update based on the updated DCO of 08-Dec-2017 among the 165 patients enrolled in 
study C2201, 111 patients were infused and comprise the FAS, 95 of these received tisagenlecleucel 
manufactured at the Morris Plains facility (Main Cohort) and 16 of them from the Fraunhofer Institute 
(Cohort A). The primary endpoint for patients in the Main Cohort was analysed in the EAS, which 
consisted of 93 patients who were followed for ≥ 3 months (or had discontinued earlier). Two patients 
in the Main Cohort who were followed for < 3 months were not included in the EAS. Of the 54 non-
infused patients, 50 were scheduled to receive tisagenlecleucel from the US manufacturing facility and 
4 patients from the Fraunhofer Institute.

ORR Sensitivity analyses 
The robustness of the primary analysis of ORR (per IRC assessment) was confirmed by the results of a 
series of predefined sensitivity analyses (Table 35).

[1] Six patients with no evidence of disease (CR) at baseline prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion who 
remain CR after infusion  
ORR per local investigator assessment and concordance with IRC 
The  ORR  as  assessed  by  local  Investigator  was  consistent  with  the  results  by  IRC  assessment. 
Discrepancy in terms of BOR assessment between IRC and the local Investigator was found in 14/81 
patients (17.3%), which corresponds to 83% BOR assessment agreement (data not shown). 
USecondary efficacy results 
Time-to-response (TTR) by IRC assessment 
Among the 43 responders per IRC assessment  in the Main Cohort, the median time to response  was 
0.9  months  (95%  CI:  0.9,  1.0).  Almost  all  responses  were  observed  within  the  first  month  following 
infusion.  The  median  time  to  response  among  the  43  responders  per  IRC  assessment  in  the  Main 
Cohort was 0.9 months (95% CI: 0.9, 1.0). The majority of the responders (79.1%; 34/43) achieved 
their disease control (CR or PR) within the first month after tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
DOR per IRC assessment 
At the data cut-off date for the protocol defined primary analysis, the median follow-up time from the 
onset of response was 2.17 months. The median DOR per IRC assessment was not reached.

Event-free survival 
At  the  data  cut-off  date  (08-Mar-2017  DCO),  59  EFS  events  per  IRC  assessment  occurred  with  a 
median follow-up time of 2.17 months. 
Table 33 EFS by local investigator and IRC assessment (FAS) 
PFS per IRC assessment 
At the data cut-off date (08-Mar-2017 DCO), 47 PFS events per  IRC assessment occurred (see  Table 
38).

Table 34: PFS by IRC assessment (FAS) 
No patients proceeded to SCT while maintaining a response to tisagenlecleucel therapy. Therefore, the 
sensitivity  analysis  per  IRC  of  DOR,  EFS,  and  PFS  without  censoring  SCT  was  identical  to  the  main 
analysis of these time-dependent secondary endpoints (i.e. with censoring SCT). 
Overall survival 
At the data cut-off date (08-Mar-2017 DCO), a total of 29 patients died after tisagenlecleucel infusion 
in  the  FAS.  The  median  OS  was  not  reached.  The  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to 
short median follow-up time (see Table 39 and Figure 16).

Patient reported outcomes 
Quality of life (QoL) assessments were performed with FACT-Lym questionnaire (disease specific) and 
the SF-36 questionnaire. The QoL instruments were completed by 76 patients (94%) at baseline and 
34 patients (42%) at Month 3. Among the 34 patients who reported PRO at 3 months, 29 patients had 
a CR or PR. The PRO results indicate that there is a small increase in QoL after 3 months for patients 
who responded in terms of ORR to treatment. 
UUpdated efficacy results in Study C2201 (data cut-off (DCO) 06 Sep 2017 and 08 Dec 2017) 
Based on the first update (DCO  06 Sep 2017), the median  time from  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  to the 
data  cut-off  was  11.4  months  (range:  2.1  to  23.1),  5.8  months  longer  than  in  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis (median: 5.6 months). Overall, 92 patients from the Main Cohort had more than 6 months of 
follow-up, or discontinued earlier. All 43 patients with a CR or PR at the time of the data cut -off for the 
primary  analysis  (08-Mar-  2017)  were  followed  for  at  least  9  months  or  discontinued  earlier.  The 
updated  analysis  of  the  Main  Cohort  including  92  patients  (EAS)  infused  with  tisagenlecleucel  is 
consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  (Table  41).  The  robustness  of  the  primary  analysis  of  ORR  (per 
IRC assessment) was confirmed by the results of a series of pre-defined sensitivity analyses.

DLBCL vs DLBCL arising from TFL 
The  initial  diagnosis  of  the  lymphoma  was  DLBCL  in  88  patients  (79.3%),  21  patients  (18.9%)  had 
DLBCL arising from TFL, and 2 patients (1.8%) had other transformed lymphoma reported in disease 
history. 
The ORR in patients with DLBCL arising from TFL was 83.3% (95% CI: 58.6, 96.4), whereas the ORR 
for  the  remaining  patients  (n=74)  was  44.6%  (95%  CI:  33.0,  56.6).  The  probability  for  being 
remission-free  3  months  after  infusion  was  similar in  responding  patients  with  DLBCL  and  those  with 
DLBCL arising from TFL (81.4% vs 76.9%). The median OS in the DLBCL subgroup was 10.1 months 
(95%  CI:  5.6,  17.9),  while  the  median  OS  for  patients  with  DLBCL  arising  from  TFL  was  not  yet 
reached.

Hypothesis 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed by testing the null hypothesis of 
ORR being less than or equal to 20% against the alternative hypothesis that 
ORR is greater than 20% at overall one-sided 2.5% level of significance, i.e., 
H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p>0.2. The study was considered successful if the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95.28% exact CI for ORR was greater than 20%, so 
that the null hypothesis that the ORR was less or equal to 20% could be 
rejected.

Analysis performed across trials  
The efficacy outcomes in the single-arm pivotal trial (C2201) were indirectly compared to three 
external datasets (SCHOLAR-1, the pooled CORAL extension studies, and the PIX301 study). 
SCHOLAR-1 study 
SCHOLAR-1 was an international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research study, 
evaluating responses and OS rates in patients with refractory NHL, including DLBCL, transformed 
follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL). 
UMethods 
SCHOLAR-1 pooled data from the observational follow up of 2 phase 3 clinical trials (Lymphoma 
Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational 
cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic (IA/MC) Lymphoma 
Specialized Program of Research Excellence). 
Only the published aggregated data for SCHOLAR-1 was submitted [28]. 
Study participants 
Subjects were included in the outcome analyses if they were determined to be refractory and had 
commenced the next line of systemic therapy for refractory disease. Refractory disease was defined as 
progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) as best response to last line of chemotherapy (≥ 4 
cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapse ≤ 12 months after autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT). Patients must have received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an 
anthracycline as 1 of their qualifying regimens. Patients with primary central nervous system 
lymphoma were excluded.  
Thus, the population in SCHOLAR-1 (relapsed) differs from the patient population in study C2201 
(relapsed and refractory). In the cross study comparison this was solved by including only those 
patients from C2201 who met the refractory criteria applied to SCHOLAR-1 in the analyses. 
Inclusion criteria for the four individual cohorts were not presented. From the limited information 
provided it seems that, compared to study C2201 (which included patients with PS 0-1 and no 
evidence of major organ dysfunction), the SCHOLAR-1 included a much broader patient population. 
Treatments 
No information regarding the salvage chemotherapies in SCHOLAR-1 was provided. Pixuvri received a 
conditional approval by the EMA in 2012 in adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory 
aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL), demonstrating a moderate improvement in ORR 
compared to salvage therapy. It is not clear if any patients in SCHOLAR-1 received Pixuvri. Thus it 
could be questioned if the SCHOLAR-1 results are fully representative of what could be expected from 
currently approved therapies in the r/r DLBCL indication.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
RR, CR and OS from the time that salvage therapy for refractory disease was initiated. Response was 
assessed using the 1999 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria per local review/ 
investigator assessment. 
Sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 107 
 
 
 
 
 
No sample size calculations were performed. All patients eligible were analysed. 
Randomisation/blinding 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Higgin’s Q-statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity of response rate between the source 
databases. If the p-value was > 0.10, data from the 4 institutions were to be pooled for analysis. Data 
were pooled at the patient-record level, and response rates were estimated from the pooled data with 
a random effects model. 
Based on the Higgin’s Q statistic the authors concluded that heterogeneity was low and it was 
appropriate to pool the studies. The power of Q statistic depends on the effective sample size (ESS) 
and should not be the sole determinant of heterogeneity. The heterogeneity test results should be 
considered alongside a qualitative assessment of the combinability of studies. The key differences are 
the retrospective vs prospective collection of data, the differences in inclusion criteria (unselected 
patients in the observational cohorts vs patients eligible for ASCT in the randomized cohorts), different 
time points at which the patients were included (time of primary refractoriness vs refractory to second-
line or later-line), differences response assessment (local vs investigator), potential differences in 
follow up schedule (limited information), potential differences in the management of patients (i.e. who 
are considered eligible for second SCT, limited information).

Results 
Table 46 Baseline Patient Characteristics for SCHOLAR-1 
According  to  the  SCHOLAR-1  publication  [28],  covariates  were  determined  at  diagnosis  for  the 
observational cohorts and at randomization (i.e. at relapse/refractoriness to first line treatment) in the 
randomized study cohorts. For all cohorts, in some cases, covariates were also measured later in the 
treatment course. For summaries of patient characteristics, the covariate measured closest in time to 
the  determination  of  refractory  status  was  used.  Thus,  it  is  understood  that  for  most  patients,  the 
reported baseline characteristics were recorded at potentially a much earlier time point than the date 
at which the therapy for refractory disease was initiated. 
UNumbers analysed 
SCHOLAR-1 analysed 636 subjects identified from a total pooled population of 861 subjects. Of the 636 
extracted patients, response rates were evaluable for 523 patients and survival was evaluable in 603 
patients.

Table 47 Response Rates to Chemotherapy After Refractory Disease SCHOLAR-1 
Data  for  disease  stage  and  IPI,  were  available  for  only  239  (46%)  and  228  (44%)  of  523  patients, 
respectively. 
UOverall survival 
The median OS was estimated as 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.9, 7.0), with a range across cohorts of 5.0-
6.6  months.  Survival  in  patients  who  achieved  (complete)  response  to  therapy,  was  14.9  months 
(median) and in patients who underwent ASCT following salvage therapy was 14.4 months (CIs and p-
values not reported, KM graphs not shown). 
The amount of missing data is large, with OS data being reported in only 81 of the 136 patients (60%) 
who  achieved  response  to  treatment  for  refractory  disease.  Furthermore,  the  published  report  for 
SCHOLAR-1  states  the  following:  When  covariates  assessed  after  commencement  of  therapy  for 
refractory status were used in survival models, survival time was calculated from the day of covariate 
assessment. 
Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) against SCHOLAR-1 
The MAIC approach, a form of propensity score weighting, was used to further adjust for cross-study 
difference in patient characteristics. All available data were utilized for this analysis: patient-level data 
from C2201 and published aggregate data from SCHOLAR-1. The comparison was first conducted by 
matching inclusion criteria between the C2201 and the SCHOLAR-1 studies. Patients from the EAS 
main cohort of the C2201 trial (n=92) were eligible for inclusion if they met the refractory criteria 
applied to SCHOLAR-1 (i.e. progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) as best response to 
chemotherapy or relapse ≤12 months post-ASCT) (n=73). 
Subsequently, patient characteristics potentially associated with treatment response, based on clinical 
input, and consistently reported in both studies were matched. Specifically, the matched variables 
included primary diagnosis (DLBCL vs. non-DLBCL), IPI risk classification (<2 vs. ≥2), and refractory 
category (primary refractory, refractory to ≥2nd line therapy, relapsed ≤12 months post ASCT). The 
Applicant was unable to match on the total number of lines of prior chemotherapy and ASCT received

because the information reported for SCHOLAR-1 was incomplete (approximately 22% of patients with 
missing data). 
Before matching, compared to SCHOLAR-1, more patients in C2201 had a diagnosis of TFL (16% vs 
4%), ECOG PS 0-1 (100% vs 73%), IPI score intermediate to high (77% vs 57%), primary refractory 
disease (41% vs 28%) and >2 number of lines of prior chemotherapy/ASCT (52% vs <1%). Baseline 
characteristics after matching showed a full match. The effective sample size was 63, a considerable 
drop from 99 (FAS) or 81 (EAS).  
UOutcomes 
Response rates 
In both populations, only those with response evaluated were included in the comparison of efficacy 
outcomes. Response was evaluated for 63 patients (out of the 73 patients) who received 
tisagenlecleucel infusion at least 3 months (90 days) prior to data cut-off date (8-March-2017) 
included from C2201.  
Before matching, tisagenlecleucel was associated with significantly higher CR and ORR compared to 
salvage therapies in SCHOLAR-1 (CR: 36.5% vs. 7.0%, P-value<0.01; ORR: 47.6% vs. 26.0%, P-
value<0.01). After matching on the primary diagnosis (DLBCL or others), IPI risk classification, and 
refractory category, the differences in CR and ORR remained significant (CR: 38.0% vs. 7.0%, P-
value<0.01; ORR: 47.4% vs. 26.0%, P-value<0.01). CTL019 was associated with a 31.0% (95% CI: 
19.1%, 43.0%) higher CR rate and a 21.4% (8.8%, 34.1%) higher ORR compared to salvage 
therapies.

TIn CORAL OS was defined as a) the time from relapse post-ASCT (in patients who had ASCT as the 
most recent therapy) or b) time from failure of CORAL induction therapy, to death from any cause. To 
align with this definition, OS in JULIET was defined as time from a) relapse after the most recent 
therapy, b) the last dose of the most recent therapy, or c) the most recent ASCT, whichever occurred 
the latest before enrolment, to death from any cause.

matching adjustment were gender, IPI risk classification (<3 vs. ≥3), ASCT as the most recent therapy 
and relapsed after ASCT (yes vs. no). The same methods as described for the JULIET vs SCHOLAR-1 
comparison were used to conduct the MAIC analyses. 
TJULIET (C2201) vs. PIX301All JULIET patients in the EAS Main Cohort were included in the

as third or fourth line treatment were included. In the primary analysis comparing ORR/CR, JULIET 
infused patients in the Main Cohort of EAS were included. In the sensitivity analysis, JULIET enrolled 
patients in the EAS Main Cohort were included. In the PIX301 trial, tumour response was assessed by 
an independent panel based on the 1999 IWG response criteria. An ORR of 30% and a CR of 1
T20% were 
seen in PIX301.1

USensitivity analysis of OS JULIET (from infusion) vs CORAL (from last relapse) 
TAs all enrolled and infused patients by definition had already survived the period of screening and wait 
to infusion, the OS curve for JULIET demonstrates an early plateau. In order to assess the impact of 
these factors on OS comparisons between JULIET (Study C2201) vs CORAL extensions, the Applicant 
provided an additional sensitivity analysis, of JULIET vs Pooled CORAL extensions, moving the time of 
start of measurement of OS in JULIET to the time of infusion.

Retrospective modification of data underlying the published analysis of the CORAL salvage study was 
requested by the CAT. For this analysis, patients from the CORAL salvage study that had died or were 
censored within the first 2 months were excluded from the comparative analysis and the origin for OS 
was moved to 2 months for the remainder of the patients. This analysis is presented in Figure 22. The

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
• 
ALL indication 
Study B2202, included patients with high risk cytogenetics, following a median of 3 prior therapies of 
which 61.3% of patients had failed prior allogeneic SCT. Overall, the study population reflects the 
clinical population of paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. Study schedules and 
duration of follow up is considered appropriate.

There was a delay of up to 3 months between staging tumour burden for each subject (done at 
enrolment to study) and administration of study product. Tumour burden may have either progressed 
during the delay or regressed in response to bridging therapies. There is, therefore, uncertainty in 
tumour burden status of subjects at the time of exposure to study product. It would have been 
preferred for tumour burden to have been assessed just prior to exposure to study product. However 
in the majority of patients with refractory ALL following multiple relapses and remission, CR/CRi 
achieved by the bridging chemotherapy is expected to be rare and of short duration. Hence, this is not 
considered to have significantly biased the results of the efficacy analyses. 
There does not appear to be a discernible dose-response relationship with the number of CAR-positive 
viable T-cells infused (see section 1.1.3 ‘‘pharmacodynamics’’. This is likely the result of the CAR-
positive T cells’ ability to proliferate and expand extensively (e.g. 1000 to >10000-fold) in vivo. Thus, 
the administered dose does not correlate with the number of CAR-positive T cells in vivo following 
engraftment and expansion, which will vary from patient to patient. Additional considerations in this 
dose selection take into account the manufacturing feasibility of producing adequate numbers of CAR-
positive cells.Given the poor prognosis and lack of effective treatment options for patients with ALL, 
the general safety profile of tisagenlecleucel, and the lack of apparent direct relationship between the 
number of CAR-positive T-cells infused and clinical outcome, infusion of a “low dose product” is 
considered preferable to the alternatives of further salvage chemotherapy or supportive treatment. 
Therefore, administration of a dose of 0.2 to 5.0×10 P
6
P CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 
kg and 0.1 to 2.5×10 P
8
P CAR-positive viable T-cells for patients >50 kg is considered justified. 
Only patients with second or greater bone marrow (BM) relapse were included in the study. This was 
not reflected in the applied indication for tisagenlecleucel and the indication has been revised to include 
paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. The added words “in 
relapse post transplant” reflect 5 patients in the population studied which is acceptable. 
There is currently no experience with manufacturing Kymriah for patients testing positive for HBV, HCV 
and HIV.Screening for HBV, HCV and HIV must be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines 
before collection of cells for manufacturing (SmPC, section 4.4).  
The requirement for CD19 tumour expression confirmed within 3 months of study entry was to ensure 
that treatment failures were not due to the treatment of ALL that was not positive for CD19. The CHMP 
raised a major objection regarding a requirement for CD19 tumour expression to be reflected in the 
SmPC. However additional data showed a lack of consistency between CD19 levels and response to 
tisagenlecleucel. While, it still seems likely that a minimum expression level would be necessary for 
efficacy, it is accepted that this could indeed be below the threshold for detection with current methods 
used in the clinic. Therefor there is no need for further investigation. 
Patients who had prior treatment with any anti-CD19/anti-CD3 therapy, or any other anti-CD19 
therapy where excluded from receiving tisagenlecleucel. Successful treatment with CD19 directed CAR-
T’s in patients failing Blincyto has been reported. It is nevertheless conceivable that these patients 
would trend toward low CD19 tumour expression and therefore not respond to tisagenlecleucel. In 
Study B2101J, three of the six patients who received prior blinatumomab had a BOR of CRi. A single 
patient had a BOR of CR and relapsed 2 years and 10 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion. There is 
limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy. Kymriah is not 
recommended if the patient has relapsed with CD19-negative leukaemia after prior anti-CD19 therapy 
(SmPC, section 4.4).

The choice of a cut-off of 3-25 years in the indication is a reflection of the inclusion criteria of the 
pivotal study B2202. In response to the comments made by CAT on the List of Questions 
(16/03/2018), the applicant submitted in its responses of 25/04/2018 a revised SmPC with the 
broader indication with regard the paediatric population. The eligibility criteria in the pivotal Study 
B2202 and supportive Study B2205J included patients from age 3 years was based on early experience 
where there was a high failure rate with the product from patients < 3 years. During the past 2 years 
the Applicant has implemented a number of improvements/modifications to the manufacturing process 
of tisagenlecleucel ensuring that leukapheresis material from patients < 3 years can be used for 
successful manufacture of tisagenlecleucel and their manufacturing facilities accept leukapheresis from 
patients ≥  6 kg. To date, tisagenlecleucel has been manufactured for 2 patients < 3 years of age in 
the commercial setting and 4 patients in the trials B2101J (n=1) and B2208J (n=3), the latter 
evaluating the earlier use of tocilizumab for the management of CRS in paediatric patients with r/r B-
cell ALL. There is no clinical basis to suggest a difference in safety or efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in 
children < 3 years of age. In order to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in ALL 
patients below the age of 3 years, the applicant should conduct and submit a study based on data from 
a disease registry in ALL patients (see Annex II). 
The upper age limit in Studies B2202 and B2205J was based on current clinical practice where 
paediatric oncologists often treat patients up to 21 years of age and this was the upper age for 
inclusion of patients in the multi-centre program. However, the actual age when receiving 
tisagenlecleucel was up to age 23 in Study B2202 and up to age 25 in Study B2205J and consequently 
this was used in the indication. This data-driven age-cut-off is considered acceptable. 
  DLBCL indication 
The pivotal study C2201 is an open-label, single arm, multicentre phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with DLBCL (including TFL) who have r/r disease after ≥ 
2 lines of chemotherapy (including rituximab and anthracycline), and who are ineligible for, have failed 
or are not consenting to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Supporting evidence is derived from 
an ongoing phase 2a case-series study (study A2101J). 
The study consists of the following sequential periods: screening including acceptance of leukapheresis 
product, pre-treatment with bridging- and lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy, one single dose of 
8
tisagenlecleucel infusion (dose range: 1.0-5.0x10P
P) and primary follow-up, secondary follow-up, 
survival follow-up and long-term follow-up (consisting of semi-annual and annual evaluations for up to 
15 years from the date of infusion on all patients under a separate long-term follow-up protocol. All 
patients were allowed to receive bridging therapies constituting standard 3 P
rd
P-line antineoplastic therapy 
based on the investigators choice to stabilize the disease while waiting for tisagenlecleucel infusion.  
Among those 101 infused patients who received bridging chemotherapy prior to infusion in study 
C2201, the median number of bridging regimens each of these patient received was 1 (range 1-5) and 
the mean number was 1.7 regimen. The median treatment duration of bridging chemotherapy 
(calculated as the sum of the durations of each bridging chemotherapy regimen) was 40 days with a 
mean duration of 48.8 days. Patients who received bridging therapy in the FAS, and who had two 
available disease assessments pre-infusion, obtained an ORR of 20.6% (95% CI: 13.2, 29.7) and 
those in the EAS an ORR of 23.5% (95% CI: 15.0, 34.0). Thus, some of the patients who received 
bridging chemotherapy had already a response to their last treatment when they were given 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Consequently, the type and numbers of various bridging therapies each 
individual patient received prior to infusion may have had an impact on the efficacy outcome of this 
Assessment report

CAR-T cell therapy, as a potential carry-over effect from the bridging chemotherapy, cannot be 
excluded. The LD therapy was limited to one preferred cyclophosphamide-based regimen of fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide, which is endorsed, as several options may cause variation in the response to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. In patients intolerant or resistant to cyclophosphamide, bendamustine was 
recommended instead as per clinical practice. 
In the study protocol, the applicant pre-specifies a manufacturing time of tisagenlecleucel of around 4-
5 weeks. This is longer than what is to be expected based on the product’s quality specifications 
(~3weeks) and longer than what has been seen with other CAR-T products. The median time from 
enrolment to infusion in study C2201 at the time of the primary analysis (DCO: 08-mar-2017; 99 
patients infused [FAS]) was 54 days (range: 30 to 357), with a median time from screening to infusion 
of 119 days (range: 49 to 396). This considerable time span from screening and enrolment to infusion 
is a concern, especially as tisagenlecleucel is intended for the treatment of patients with an advanced 
disease expected to progress rapidly.  
According to the applicant, this high turnaround time was due to the prolonged production time, 
secondary to limited capacity at the US manufacturing facility, in the beginning of the study and it was 
clarified the manufacturing capacity was improved in August 2016, when the EU manufacturing site 
(Fraunhofer) started to actively produce tisagenlecleucel. In fact the actual manufacturing time did not 
change throughout the study, staying consistent at a median of 30-34 days which is consistent with 
the pre-specified 4-5 weeks. In the commercial setting, the time from receipt of leukapheresis to 
product shipment is currently 24 days and is targeted to be 22 days going forward. This is now 
reflected in the product information and educational material. 
No classic dose-finding studies were conducted in any of the indications. The protocol specified dose 
range in study C2201 was therefore based on the experience in the Penn (UPCC13413) study in r/r 
lymphoma (18 DLBCL, 8 FL), whereas preliminary clinical experiences also were taking into 
consideration. Some patients were given tisagenlecleucel even though the recommended dose was not 
met, since these patients did not have any other effective treatment options available. Patients who 
received doses below (n=5) and above (n=5) the target dose range had similar response rates as 
those patients who received doses within the protocol-specified dose range of 1.0-5.0 x 10P
8
P CAR-
positive viable cells. 
Disease staging and response assessment was performed with PET-CT only within 28 days prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion and at 3 months post-infusion. However, for the assessment of responses at 
the other pre-defined time points, conventional CT or MRI was performed. Best overall response was 
determined according to the Lugano classification, at each recorded time-point based on the scan 
available (i.e. conventional CT/MRI or PET-CT). In cases where both modalities were available, PET-
based responses over-ruled the CT-based responses. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed by testing the null hypothesis of ORR being less than or 
equal to 20% against the alternative hypothesis that ORR is greater than 20% at overall one-sided 
2.5% level of significance. This was not consistent with a previous advice given by the CHMP 
(28/04/2016; EMEA/H/SAH/061/1/2016/ADT/II), which stated that for registration based on a phase II 
trial, the clinical benefit should be at least superior to that observed in the CORAL study (ORR 40.3%).  
In three historical dataset controls, unadjusted ORR ranged from 26% (SCHOLAR-1) or 30% (PIX301) 
to 40.3% (CORAL extension studies). Similar to the JULIET (C2201) trial, the CORAL study selected for 
better patients, due to the anticipated toxicity of the transplant that was the intentional treatment. 
Therefore, the CORAL study was considered the most relevant historical dataset for indirect 
comparison to the JULIET (C2201) trial.

The chosen secondary endpoints of TTR, DOR, EFS, PFS, and OS were appropriate and consistent with 
a previous advice given by the CHMP (28/04/2016; EMEA/H/SAH/061/1/2016/ADT/II) where the 
applicant was recommended to use a combined interpretation of ORR and CR in particular, together 
with DOR, PFS and OS. The sample size was appropriate to demonstrate a statistically significant result 
in the primary analysis. However, the calculations of the sample size were based on the 20% ORR for 
the control; with a higher control ORR a larger sample size would be needed. With the current sample 
size, short follow-up time and a high censoring rate, meaningful conclusions from the time to event 
analyses are difficult to reach.  
Based on a systematic literature review three historical datasets were identified where indirect 
comparisons to C2201 were deemed feasible: SCHOLAR-1, the pooled CORAL extensions and the 
rituximab treated patients in the PIX301 (the pivotal study for the Pixuvri MAA). Indirect comparisons 
of ORR/CR and OS were performed using 1) C2201 infused patients and 2) C2201 enrolled patients. 
Adjustment for baseline characteristics were conducted for two of the three datasets (SCHOLAR and 
CORAL). The SCHOLAR-1 comparison was first conducted by applying the refractory criteria used in 
SCHOLAR-1 to the C2201 study population. Subsequently, matching was performed on three variables 
(primary diagnosis (DLBCL vs. non-DLBCL), IPI risk classification (<2 vs. ≥ 2), and refractory category 
(primary refractory, refractory to ≥ 2nd line therapy, relapsed ≤ 12 months post ASCT). For the CORAL 
comparison, matching was based on 3 variables; gender, IPI risk classification (<3 vs. ≥3) and ASCT 
as the most recent therapy and relapsed after ASCT (yes vs. no). 
Supportive Study A2101J (NCT02030834) is an ongoing Phase 2a case-series study evaluating the 
efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including GC and 
non-germinal center (NGC) DLBCL, "Double hit" DLBCL (DHL), and transformation of follicular 
lymphoma (tFL). Patients were eligible if they had CD19+ DLBCL or follicular lymphoma (FL) with 
measurable residual disease after primary and salvage therapies, had relapsed or residual disease after 
ASCT, or were not eligible for autologous or allogeneic SCT. 
The enrolled patients received LD chemotherapy based on each patient’s treatment history, blood 
counts, and organ function (data not shown). One single dose of tisagenlecleucel were infused 1 to 4 
days after the completion of LD chemotherapy at the dose range of 1.0 to 5.0x10 P
8
P cells. The median 
number of days from apheresis to infusion in study A2101J was 39 (range: 27 to 145). In total, 10 of 
28 patients received bridging therapy. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy 
of tisagenlecleucel in NHL patients by measuring the ORR in evaluable patients at 3 months.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
• 
ALL indication 
Results from the pivotal study B2202 showed that tisagenlecleucel significantly improved ORR: 61 of 
the 75 infused patients (81.3%) had a best overall disease response of CR or CRi as determined by 
IRC. As a result, using the pre-specified endpoint in the SPA for B2202, the lower limit of the 95% 
exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for ORR was 70.7% for CR/CRi, which is above the pre-set 
null hypothesis rate of 20%. Forty five patients (60%) had a best response of CR within the first 3 
months after infusion, and 16 patients (21.3%) had a best response of CRi. The study also met its 
primary objective with an ORR (BOR as CR or CRi; during the 3 months after tisagenlecleucel 
administration in patients by IRC assessment) of 82.0% (95% CI: 68.6, 91.4) analysed based on first 
50 infused patients. The robustness of the primary analysis of ORR (per IRC assessment) was 
confirmed by the results of a series of predefined sensitivity analyses with the ORR ranging from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
63.5% to 82.4% in different analysis sets, with the lower bounds of all 95% CIs above 20%. Efficacy in 
patients infused with tisagenlecleucel from the EU manufacturing facility was 75% and consistent with 
the overall results.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints the proportion of patients with BOR of CR/CRi by IRC assessment 
with MRD negative bone marrow (i.e., MRD <0.01%) during three months after tisagenlecleucel 
infusion was 61/75 (81.3%, 95% CI: 70.7, 89.4). The majority of patients who had a CR or CRi after 
tisagenlecleucel treatment achieved a sustained response and median DOR per IRC assessment was 
not reached at Primary data cut-off date 25-Apr-2017 (median duration of follow up 7.5 months). The 
median EFS was not reached, with 6-month EFS of 72.7%. The median OS was 19.1 months (15.2, 
NE), with 12-month OS of 76.4%. Results from these time-dependent endpoints provide support for 
sustained benefit of tisagenlecleucel.  
Patients in the B2202 reported improvements in health related quality of life outcomes at 3 and 6 
months among responders to therapy. Tisagenlecleucel infusion led to a decrease in the severity of 
problems as measured by the emotional, social, physical, and psychosocial health subscales as well as 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression as assessed via the EQ-5D 
questionnaire. Thus, results indicate a meaningful improvement in patients responding to treatment. 
ORR in the supportive studies B2205J and B2101J were 69% and 94.6% respectively. Overall, these 
results provide supportive evidence for the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in the treatment of paediatric 
and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. 
Results from the historical controls were presented either as a comparison of pooled patients who 
received tisagenlecleucel or as B2202 patients alone. After adjusting for population differences via 
MAIC, CTL019 was estimated to have superior OS and ORR over blinatumomab, CEC, and clofarabine 
monotherapy. Additionally tisagenlecleucel was estimated to have superior RFS over blinatumomab. 
Overall, this comparison is subject to potential bias due to unobserved or unmeasurable confounding. 
At the same time it is noted that the degree of benefit observed was largely consistent regardless of 
whether the comparison was made using B2202 only or using the pooled CTL019 studies and was 
largely consistent between the primary analysis and sensitivity analyses across all the comparators and 
endpoints. Finally, the benefit of tisagenlecleucel was still consistent across all the sensitivity analyses 
performed. Since the populations in the studies were different the benefit of tisagenlecleucel may have 
been underestimated. 
• 
DLBCL indication 
Only those 81 patients who received tisagenlecleucel infusion from the US manufacturing facility at 
least 3 months prior to data cut-off were included in the efficacy analysis set (EAS), which was the 
primary analysis population. 
In the FAS, the majority of patients were white (90.9%; 90 patients) and men (63.6%; 63 patients). 
The median age was 54 years (range 22-76) with 23.2% (23 patients) being ≥ 65 years, and none 
above 76 years. This is younger than would be expected, given that DLBCL peaks in the 7th decade, 
and probably reflects the eligibility criteria. The majority of patients had DLBCL histology (79.8%) and 
a smaller group had transformed lymphoma (19.2%). The percentage of patients who were refractory 
to last line (51.5%) was marginally higher than those who relapsed to last line therapy (48.5%). 
Approximately 50% of patients had prior autologous SCT, and 18.1% had received ≥4 prior lines of 
anti-neoplastic therapies. Thus, the majority of the patients in study C2201 had relapsed or were 
refractory to either 2/3 prior therapies (75.7%). 
Assessment report

In the “not infused” set compared to the FAS, there was a higher proportion of patients with 
unfavourable prognostic factors: Age ≥65 years, 33.3% vs. 23.2%; ECOG 1, 66.7% vs. 45.5%; stage 
III-IV at initial diagnosis, 79.2% vs. 66.7%; stage III at study entry 29.2% vs. 21.2%; IPI ≥2 at initial 
diagnosis, 68.8% vs. 56.6% and IPI ≥2 at study entry, 93.8% vs. 72.7%. Fewer patients in the “not 
infused” set had undergone HSCT (37.5% vs. 47.5%) and a higher proportion were refractory to the 
last treatment line without prior HSCT (31.3% vs. 17.2%). On the other hand, a higher fraction in the 
“not infused” set compared to the FAS had tumours of the GBC subtype (60.4% vs. 51.5%) and a 
slightly higher proportion had double/triple hits in myc/bcl2/bcl6 genes (18.8% vs. 12.1%). Overall, 
these data indicate that the prolonged time-period from apheresis to CAR-T administration enriched 
the patient population included in the FAS for a better prognosis.  
The mean and median time from the end of the last antineoplastic therapy to enrolment were longer in 
the long-term responders (8.6 and 5.1 months, respectively) than in the non-responders (4.1 and 2.8 
months). The mean time from the most recent relapse/progression was also somewhat longer in the 
long-term responders compared to the non-responders (6.8 vs. 5.5 months). The proportion of 
patients with lymphomas of double/triple hits in myc/bcl2/bcl6 genes were also lowest in the long-term 
responders. Thus, again this indicates that inclusion in the EAS of only those patients who survived the 
long pre-infusion waiting period, selected for patients with a more favourable survival prognosis on 
current therapies, who were more likely to respond to treatment. 
Among the 217 screened patients in study C2201, 165 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 147 
patients were enrolled. In total, 99 patients received tisagenlecleucel (FAS) at the primary analysis 
(DCO: 08-mar-2017), whereas 48 enrolled patients were never infused.  
The study protocol specified that patients should not experience significant worsening in the clinical 
status compared to the initial eligibility criteria prior to infusion. Combined with the prolonged waiting 
period, this may have contributed to the large proportion (~30%) of poor prognosis patients dropping-
out after enrolment and prior to receiving tisagenlecleucel, potentially enriching the patient population 
in the EAS for patients having a better prognosis. Thus, for the efficacy outcomes, the results based on 
the ITT (enrolled) population is considered the primary analysis set. 
The best ORR based on IRC in the EAS of 81 patients was 53.1% (43/81; 95% CI: 41.7, 64.3; 
p<0.0001). Among the responding patients, 39.5% (32/81 patients) achieved a CR, while 13.6% 
(11/81 patients) obtained a PR. The ORR response at 3 months of follow-up was 38.3 % (31/81 
patients) and 32% (26/81 patients) for CR. However as the overall treatment in study C2201 includes 
leukapheresis, bridging- and LD chemotherapy, and tisagenlecleucel infusion, efficacy analysis of 
tisagenlecleucel based on the infused patients only as this likely might provide unrealistic positive 
efficacy results of the therapy. Sensitivity analysis of ORR by IRC where all enrolled patients with the 
updated DCO was taken into account showed an ORR of 33.9% (56/165; 95% CI: 26.8, 41.7) - 
significantly lower than the ORR in the EAS. Compared to the pre-specified historical control with an 
ORR of around 20% (used in hypothesis testing) - 26% (pooled estimate from SCHOLAR-1) and 40.3% 
(estimate from the pooled CORAL extension studies), these results are not considered compelling. 
The median TTR among the 43 responders per IRC assessment in the EAS Main Cohort was 0.9 months 
(95% CI: 0.9, 1.0). As evident form the KM plot, the majority of the responders (79.1%; 34/43) 
achieved their disease control (CR or PR) within the first month after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The 
median DOR per IRC assessment was not reached at the DCO of the primary analysis. The median 
follow-up time from onset of response was 2.17 months (range: 1.5, 11.3). At the DCO of the primary 
analysis 65.1% of the responding patients (28/43) were still in an ongoing response to 
tisagenlecleucel. The median EFS per IRC assessment at the DCO of the primary analysis was 2.6 
months (95% CI: 2.1, 3.1). The median follow-up time of 2.17 months (range: 0.9, 12.1) was short

and 39 patients who were ongoing without an event were censored. The median PFS per IRC 
assessment was 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.2, 6.2). Median follow-up time at the DCO was 2.14 months 
(range: 0.9, 12.1). With a median follow-up time of 3.58 months (range: 2.2, 14.5) in the FAS, 
median OS was not yet reached (95% CI: 6.5, NE). The data of the primary analysis on DOR, EFS, PFS 
and OS should be interpreted with caution due to the short median follow-up time and high censoring 
of patients. 
ORRs analysis was performed for various demographic and prognostic subgroups in the EAS Main 
Cohort that contained at least 5 patients in each subgroup. The ORR values by IRC assessment ranged 
on average from 39.5% to 83.3% in all the subgroups analysed, except for the subgroup of patients 
<40 years of age where only one patient achieved a PR (ORR 8.3%; 1/12). Hence, the majority of the 
subgroups evaluated achieved a disease control rate in line with the ORR of the primary analysis of 
53.1% (95% CI: 41.7, 64.3). The lower limit of the 95% CIs for most of the subgroups, with the 
exception of patients <40 years and those with double/triple-hit rearrangements, were above the pre-
specified historical control ORR of 20%. 
Concerning the low sample sizes within each subset, these differences should be interpreted with 
caution. However, the data provided points to a trend of lower efficacy in terms of ORR in patients who 
were refractory to last line therapy and patients below 40 years of age. It is well-known that patients 
who are refractory to last line therapy may have a more severe outcome. The lower efficacy in r/r 
DLBCL patients under 40 years of age is unexpected; no association with an underlying prognostic 
factor could be identified. 
In an updated analysis with an additional median follow-up time of 5.8 months the median time from 
infusion to the DCO was 11.4 months (range: 2.1 to 23.1). Best ORR based on IRC in the updated EAS 
of 92 patients was 52.2% (95% CI: 41.5, 62.7). In line with the results of the primary analysis, 38.0% 
of the responding patients achieved a CR, while 14.1% obtained a PR. The response rates of patients 
who achieved CR were sustained at month 3 (32.6%; 95% CI: 23.2, 43.2) and month 6 (29.3%; 95% 
CI: 20.3, 39.8). In line with the results of the primary analysis, the median DOR per IRC assessment 
was not reached in the EAS at the DCO of the updated analysis however, there is evidence that a large 
proportion of patients who achieve a CR sustained clinically meaningful remission. This does not seem 
to apply to the low number of patients who achieved a PR (N=13), with the exception of three 
patients. The median OS in the updated FAS of 106 patients was 10.3 months (95% CI: 6.7, NE). 
Although the OS support the ORR results, the data was not very mature.  
Quality of life (QoL) assessments were performed with FACT-Lym questionnaire (disease specific) and 
the SF-36 questionnaire. The QoL instruments were completed by 76 patients (94%) at baseline and 
34 patients (42%) at Month 3. Among the 34 patients who reported PRO at 3 months, 29 patients had 
a CR or PR. The PRO results indicate that there is a small increase in QoL after 3 months for patients 
who responded in terms of ORR to treatment. However, the design of the phase 2 study (uncontrolled, 
non-randomized, open-label) makes it difficult to conclude if any clinically relevant symptomatic 
improvement. 
In the updated results from Study C2201 based on a DCO date of 08-Dec-2017 165 patients were 
enrolled and 111 patients infused and comprise the FAS: 95 received tisagenlecleucel manufactured at 
the Morris Plains facility (EAS Main Cohort) and 16 at the Fraunhofer Institute (Cohort A). The median 
duration of follow-up is 13.9 months with a median duration of follow-up of 7.7 months. All responding 
patients were followed for ≥ 9 months after response. The set of ‘all eligible patients who underwent 
leukapheresis’ was the same as the set of ‘all enrolled’ patients.

Efficacy results showed an ORR of 51.6% (48/93) in infused patients versus 33.6% (48/143) in 
enrolled patients in the EAS Main cohort and 33.9 % (56/165) in all enrolled - which is at the same 
level as at initial DCO. Median OS from enrolment date was 12.9 months (95% CI: 8.4, NE) in the 
infused population and 8.2 months (95% CI: 5.8, 11.7) in the enrolled population. The median OS 
from infusion was 11.7 months in the infused population, this increased as compared to the 10.3 
months at the DCO of 06-Sep-2017. In the non-infused patients median PFS was 2.1 months versus 
4.4 months in all enrolled and 5.1 months FAS. Furthermore, the median OS from enrolment was 
considerably lower in the non-infused patients (median 2.4 months); similarly the median OS from last 
relapse was FAS 16.3 months, all enrolled 10.6 months, non-infused 5.0 months. 
There is a concern that the use of the EAS for all efficacy outcomes ignores the impact of waiting time 
and bridging therapy thus leading to an enrichment of the patient population in the EAS for patients 
having a better prognosis, and an overestimation of efficacy for tisagenlecleucel. In the update, 
baseline characteristics were also given for the non-infused patients, showing that these patients had a 
higher representation of patients who were ≥65 years (FAS 22.5% vs non-infused 40.7%), ECOG 1 
(FAS 45% vs non-infused 70.4%), IPI≥2 (FAS 94.4% vs non-infused 72.1%) at study entry and 
refractory to last treatment (FAS 55% vs non-infused 64.8%). In general, baseline characteristics were 
worse in this group.  
Furthermore, an analysis on OS from last relapse in patients with SD or PD following salvage/bridging 
therapy was provided. According to this, such patients in the JULIET trial had a similar KM curve as the 
subset of SD/PD patients in the CORAL study, both subsets showing a far lower OS than in the SD/PD 
subset of the infused patients in the JULIET trial. This indicates that not including these patients in the 
efficacy analyses introduces a bias that is not present in the CORAL trial. 
Updated efficacy results were presented for DLBCL versus DLBCL arising from TFL (18.9%; 21/111). 
The ORR in the subgroup of 18 patients with DLBCL / TFL was 83.3% (95% CI: 58.6, 96.4), whereas 
the ORR for the remaining patients (n=74) was 44.6% (95% CI: 33.0, 56.6). The median OS in the 
DLBCL subgroup was 10.1 months (95% CI: 5.6, 17.9), while the median OS for patients with DLBCL 
arising from TFL was not yet reached. Of note, a larger proportion of the patients with DLBCL arising 
from TFL responded to tisagenlecleucel, and 33 % (6/18) and 50 % (9/18) of these were short- and 
long-term responders. Overall, the data provided reveal a better efficacy outcome in patients with 
DLBCL arising from TFL. 
SCHOLAR-1 analysed 636 subjects identified from a total pooled population of 861 subjects. Compared 
to study C2201, SCHOLAR-1 had fewer patients with a diagnosis of TFL (4% vs 16%), ECOG PS 0-1 
(73% vs 100%), IPI score intermediate to high (57% vs 77%), primary refractory disease (28% vs 
41%) and >2 number of lines of prior chemotherapy/ASCT (<1% vs 52%). It is however not clear to 
what extent the baseline characteristics reflect the status of the patient at the time of initiation of 
savage therapy. Response rates (evaluated for 523 patients) was estimated as 26% (95% CI: 21%, 
31%), ranging from 20% to 31% across cohorts (95% CI not reported). The CR was 7% (95% CI: 3%, 
15%), ranging from 2-15% (95% CI not reported). The median OS was estimated as 6.3 months 
(95% CI: 5.9, 7.0), with a range across cohorts of 5.0 - 6.6 months. 
In overall it seems that accounting for all uncertainties and applying conservative approaches, efficacy 
of Kymriah in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL is seen and further data including details of the 
manufacturing turnaround time, (i.e. time from last relapse or confirmed refractory status, time from 
decision to treat, and time from leukapheresis to infusion) will be obtained from post-authorisation 
studies; a prospective, observational study in patients with r/r DLBCL based on data from registry with 
efficacy outcome measures in line with study C2201; further follow-up (24 months) for patients in the 
EAS Cohort and all infused patients from study C2201; and study CCTL019H2301 - open-label, Phase

cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Further to the uncertainties identified during the assessment of the DLBCL indication as the study 
design, study conduct and study analysis (use of historical comparisons) the CAT considered that the 
SAG Oncology should be consulted.  
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG Oncology was consulted on the following issues: 
U Population 
1.  How representative do you view the population that was administered Kymriah of the population 
encountered in the clinical setting considering that patients dropped out due to the delay in 
manufacturing (i.e. the selection of patients from the ITT to the mITT population) and received 
bridging chemotherapy? 
As a general comment, it is important to stress that the ITT analysis set (all enrolled patients, 
regardless of treatment actually received) is the most relevant population to estimate the efficacy 
of bridging chemotherapy plus Kymriah in the real-life setting. Other analysis sets (infused, 
evaluable, responders) are likely to introduce important selection bias. 
Concerning the ITT population, it is likely that selection bias has been introduced by the eligibility 
criteria (ECOG PS 0-1; adequate organ function), and patients >65 years old are likely to be 
under-represented. The views within the group were slightly diverging in terms of generalizability. 
However, it was acknowledged that this type of selection is common for clinical trials and the 
uncertainties in terms of generalization to the normal population did not pose any major concerns. 
Indeed, when an intensive regimen is proposed to patients, there is anyway a selection.  
The initial manufacturing problems and delay in infusion of Kymriah have to be taken into account 
and improvements in the lymphoma progression prior to infusion are expected on the basis of 
improvements in the manufacturing speed. Thus, the results observed in the ITT population likely 
represent a conservative estimate for the target patient population. 
However, concerning deviations from the ITT analysis set, such as in the infused “mITT” 
population, further selection bias is likely and it is difficult rule out important over-estimation of the 
treatment effect. (It is understood, that traditionally the results are given for the ITT and for the 
patient submitted to treatment, i.e., infused patients and that both set of data should be 
described.) 
In conclusion, the ITT population was considered relevant and representative based on reasonable 
assumptions and extrapolations.  
2.  How does the selection of patients from the ITT to the mITT population, due to the delay in 
administration, impact your evaluation of the efficacy of Kymriah? 
Other analysis sets (infused, evaluable, responders) than the ITT set may be useful for exploratory 
analyses but are likely to introduce important selection bias. The relevant estimate of the 
probability of experiencing benefits to inform treatment decisions is the probability of response at 
the start of treatment procedure (i.e., ITT) and not the probability of response conditional on some 
future event like actually receiving an infusion or being evaluable for response.

Treatment outcomes 
3.  Can in your experience complete responses of relevant duration be observed in the population of 
interest (i.e. DBCL that have relapsed or are refractory to several lines of standard therapy) with 
salvage treatment (chemotherapy/radio therapy/SCT) only? 
The data in this population are limited. In the C2201 trial, bridging chemotherapy was associated 
with a <10% proportion of CR. A 28% CR rate was observed in the follow-up cohorts of the 
CORAL-1/2 studies (N=278), which is similar to what observed in the ITT population for trial C2201 
(with all limitations of indirect comparisons, see also answer to question 5), but the population of 
the C2201 trial was mostly pretreated by more lines of therapy than in the CORAL trial. 
Concerning exploratory subgroups (acknowledging the selection bias, see answer to question 1), 
for the infused population the ORR was 52% with 40% CR rate associated with prolonged duration 
of response in the last evaluation presented. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation performed only in 
responding patients leading to a selection of the patients and the chemorefractory ones are 
excluded from this procedure. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with high response 
rate but only few patients in this situation make it to the procedure (and ranges will vary nationally 
depending on local practice) and transplant mortality is seen by many as prohibitively high (10% 
to more than 30% depending on the series).  
4.  How do you evaluate the impact of bridging chemotherapy on the efficacy outcomes?  
The effect is likely to be small and of little impact although the estimated complete response rate 
was almost 10% in patients who did not receive Kymriah. Some SAG members raised potential 
risks if the bridging therapy was to be modified significantly. In any case, bridging therapy should 
be considered as an essential element of the treatment strategy. The ITT analysis assesses the 
efficacy of the whole strategy of bridging therapy plus Kymriah (and not Kymriah alone). 
5.  In this context can you comment on the relevance of the data from the CORAL study for 
interpretation of the Kymriah results? 
Comparison between the two studies is difficult due to the different study populations (population 
in C2201 more heavily pre-treated) and the known problems with indirect comparison. Still, the 
CORAL studies provide a reasonable comparison for exploratory purposes. As a comment, it is 
possible that in the future such indirect comparisons could additionally be conducted on the basis 
of population-based registry data (although it is acknowledged that this may be possible only in 
selected countries and often on the basis of less extensive data collection on patient 
characteristics). In conclusion, the comparison is relevant to contextualise the observed effects. 
6.  What conclusions can be drawn on clinical benefit given the limitations of the follow-up time for 
time-dependent endpoints and the single arm trial design? 
Based on the ITT analysis set that is considered the most relevant and conservative to estimate 
the effect of the treatment strategy, the complete response rate observed is in the range of what 
has been observed with other treatment modalities (CORAL studies). However, the duration of 
response is considered remarkable with more than 60% of responders still responding after a 
median follow-up of 19 months. Taken together, based on the response rate and duration of 
response, given the available treatment options, the group agreed by consensus that the clinical 
benefit is considered established despite the limitations for time-dependent endpoints in single arm 
trials. Concerning OS, a number of suitable approaches have been explored based on matching. 
While informative, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the basis of the analyses presented since 
important biases (including lead time bias) cannot be excluded.

7.  For which patients with DLBCL would Kymriah be a treatment option given available data on 
efficacy and safety? 
Based on the available data, Kymriah may be a treatment option for patients failing or relapsing 
after at least 2 lines of therapy . It is difficult to further specify criteria to select patients for whom 
Kymriah might be a treatment option. This has to be left to informed clinical decisions that can 
assess patient preferences, and the benefits, risks, and uncertainties of all available treatment 
options, including stem cell transplantation and clinical trials. Treatment should only be initiated in 
centres that are experienced also in these types of procedures.  
Furthermore, if possible, research on identification of biomarkers predictive of response should 
continue, with the aim to guide treatment decisions. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
• 
ALL indication 
Results of the B2202 study demonstrated that a single infusion with tisagenlecleucel showed a high 
increase of ORR in aggressive relapsed or refractory ALL. Despite limited follow up, the results from 
time-dependent secondary endpoints such as DOR, EFS and OS provide support for sustained benefit 
of tisagenlecleucel.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary: 
 
PAES: In order to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in ALL patients below 
the age of 3 years, the applicant should conduct and submit a study based on data from a 
disease registry in ALL patients. 
• 
DLBCL indication  
Whereas the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in terms of ORR/CR was modest based on the most 
conservative analyses, the duration of response in complete responders is substantial and therefore 
clinically relevant in the patient population.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary: 
 
PAES: In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Kymriah in patients with 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL, the applicant should conduct and submit a prospective, 
observational study in patients with r/r DLBCL based on data from registry with efficacy 
outcome measures in line with study C2201, including details of the manufacturing 
turnaround time, (i.e. time from last relapse or confirmed refractory status, time from 
decision to treat, and time from leukapheresis to infusion). 
 
PAES: In order to further characterise long-term efficacy and safety of Kymriah in 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL, the applicant should submit the 24 months follow-up for 
patients in the main Cohort and 24 months follow-up of all infused patients from study 
C2201. In addition the applicant should submit the final CSR including 5 years of follow-up. 
 
PAES: In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Kymriah in 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL, the applicant should submit the results of study CCTL019H2301 
- open-label, Phase III study of Kymriah versus standard of care in adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
  ALL indication 
The safety assessment is assessed based on the below studies:  
Study B2202 (patients enrolled: N=92, patients infused: N =75), study B2205J (patients enrolled: 
N=35, patients infused: N=29). Pool and study B2101J (patients enrolled: N=73, patients infused: 
N=62 including 56 non-CNS3 ALL patients, 4 CNS3 ALL and 2 lymphoma patients). For all studies the 
follow-up of safety post-tisagenlecleucel infusion was daily to every third day until day 28, thereafter 
monthly first 6 month, thereafter every third month until 24 months. Thereafter every sixth month to 
yearly until 60 months for studies in the SCS Pool. 
Safety in studies B2202 and B2205J is presented as pooled data. 
  DLBCL indication 
Evaluation of safety is based on data from Study C2201 in 27 sites. Planned follow-up is 60 months. 
Patients were assessed for AEs at each clinic visit: Daily to every third day until day 28, thereafter 
monthly first 6 months, thereafter every third month until 24 months, thereafter every sixth month 
until 60 months. 
Patient exposure 
  ALL indication 
In the SCS Pool the median (range) dose of tisagenlecleucel infused was 1.06×108 (range: 0.03×108 to 
2.6×108) CAR-positive viable T cells for all patients regardless of weight. The median (range) weight 
adjusted dose of tisagenlecleucel infused was 3.2×106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg (range: 0.2×106 
to 5.4×106). 
The clinical dose selected for the supportive study B2101J included a wide range from 1.5×107 to 
5×109 (0.3×106 to 1.0×108 cells per kg) total T cells. The total number of CAR-positive T cells varied 
among batches (range: 1 x 107 to 1 x 109). The total dose in this study was administered in three 
divided fractions in this study (i.e. 10%, 30%, 60% of the total cell dose) to ensure safe 
tisagenlecleucel administration. Subsequent doses were held with the onset of fever or other acute 
events. Within the first 28 days of the study, the median total tisagenlecleucel dose infused was 
1.6×108 cells (range 0.1×108 to 9.1×108). The median weight adjusted tisagenlecleucel dose infused 
was 4.8×106 CAR-positive cells/kg (range 0.6×106 to 16.4×106). Anytime during the study, the 
median total tisagenlecleucel dose infused was 3.4×108 cells (range 0.1×108 to 11.4 ×108). The 
median weight adjusted tisagenlecleucel dose infused was 7.5×106 CAR-positive cells/kg (range 
0.6×106 to 22.6 ×106). 
In the SCS Pool, all infused patients received concomitant medications after tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Concomitant medications administered were representative of those routinely prescribed for paediatric 
and young adult patients with r/r ALL for treatment and prophylaxis of AEs. The most commonly used 
concomitant medications (per ATC class) included multiple medications used by 102 (98.1%) patients 
(including vancomycin by 46.2%), anilides (paracetamol) used by 77 (74.0%) patients, natural opium 
alkaloids used by 50 (48.1%) patients, immunoglobulins used by 49 (47.1%) patients, and serotonin 
antagonist used by 47 (45.2%) patients.

In the supportive study B2101J the most commonly used (by ≥ 70% patients) and the most relevant 
concomitant medications by ATC class regardless of the proportion of treated patients included: natural 
opium alkaloids (96.4%), immunoglobulins (75%), antibiotics (87.5%) including gentamycin and 
vancomycin. 
  DLBCL indication  
In total 99 adult patients treated with single intravenous tisagenlecleucel infusion of 1.0 to 5.0×10 P

data cut-off of 06 Sep 2017, a safety analysis with updated frequency data for AESI of a total of 106 
patients was included. Median dose in this analysis is 3.0x10 P
8 
cell dose infused was 10.5x10 P
P(range: 0.9-30.0. At the cut-off date of 08 Dec 2017 (addendum dated

18.04.2018 ) the analysis included safety data for in total 111 patients with DLBCL indication with a 
median duration of follow-up of 13.9 months; this analysis is used in the assessment where possible.

Cytokine release syndrome 
In the ongoing clinical studies in paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL (N=75), cytokine release 
syndrome was reported in 77% of patients (47% with Grade 3 or 4). Two deaths occurred within 
30 days of Kymriah infusion: one patient died with cytokine release syndrome and progressive 
leukaemia and the second patient had resolving cytokine release syndrome with abdominal 
compartment syndrome, coagulopathy and renal failure when death occurred due to an intracranial 
haemorrhage. In the ongoing clinical study in DLBCL (N=111), cytokine release syndrome was 
reported in 58% of patients, (22% with Grade 3 or 4) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Cytokine release syndrome was graded with the Penn scale as follows: Grade 1: mild reactions, e.g. 
reactions requiring supportive care; Grade 2: moderate reactions, e.g. reactions requiring intravenous 
therapies; Grade 3: severe reactions, e.g. reactions requiring low-dose vasopressors or supplemental 
oxygen; Grade 4: life-threatening reactions, e.g. those requiring high-dose vasopressors or intubation; 
Grade 5: death (SmPC, section 4.8).

In the majority of patients, development of CRS occurred between 1 to 11 days (median onset: 3 
days, range 1-22 days) after tisagenlecleucel infusion in ALL patients and between 1 and 9 days 
(median onset: 3 days) after the tisagenlecleucel infusion in DLBCL patients. The median duration of 
CRS was 8 days (range 1-36 days) in ALL patients and 7 days (median 2-18 days) in DLBCL patients. 
CRS and dose: In the individual Studies B2202 and B2205J in ALL patients, there is no apparent 
relationship between CRS grade and tisagenlecleucel dose. DLBCL patients were safely treated up to 
the highest dose of 6.0x108 CAR+ viable T cells. 
CRS and fever: In the SCS Pool of the 84 ALL patients with CRS, 80 (95.2%) had high fever with a 
median duration of fevers of 6 days (range: 1-36), with the onset being earlier among patients with 
grade 4 CRS. In DLBCL high fevers were reported in 94.7% of patients. The median duration of high 
fever was 4.0 days (range 1-17). 
CRS and hypotension: Among the patients in the SCS Pool with CRS, 49 (58.3%) patients had 
hypotension that required intervention. High-dose vasopressors were required for 28 (33.3%) patients. 
Oxygen supplementation was required in 42 (50%) patients and of those patients 16 required 
intubation for a median duration of 8.0 days (range 4-26). In DLBCL patients hypotension that 
required intervention among patients with CRS was reported for 28 patients (49.1%); use of high dose 
vasopressors was reported in 6 patients (10.5%). 
CRS and disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinogen levels: Tisagenlecleucel associated 
coagulopathy during CRS can be associated with severe hypofibrinogenemia as observed in the Phase I 
Study B2101J [29],[30],[31]. In the SCS Pool, analysis of fibrinogen levels during the first episode of 
CRS by CRS grade showed that patients with grade 4 CRS had a lower median fibrinogen level 
compared to those patients with the CRS grade of 1-3. The low fibrinogen levels were successfully 
managed by replacement therapy with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) was observed in 12 (14.3%) ALL patients and bleeding events were 
observed in 15 (17.9%) of patients. Among DLBCL patients disseminated intravascular coagulation 
concurrent with CRS was reported in 3 patients (5.3%), no relationship between fibrinogen level and 
CRS severity was apparent. 
In the ALL patients anti-cytokine therapy was received by 35 (41.7%) of the patients with CRS, 
tocilizumab was administered to all 35 patients; 19 of whom required only 1 dose of tocilizumab. Five

patients (6%) received siltuximab and 19 patients (23%) had treatment with corticosteroids in addition 
to other anti-cytokine drugs (Table 59). 
Table 55 Anti-cytokine therapy during CRS (Safety set - Patients with CRS) 
Tisagenlecleucel positive cells continued to expand and persist after administration of tocilizumab. The 
administration of anti-IL6 agents and corticosteroids did not result in lower tisagenlecleucel expansion 
profiles as determined by AUC0-28d and Cmax. Corticosteroids are administered at low doses over 
short duration and weaned rapidly following a poor response to tocilizumab per the CRS treatment 
algorithm. Anti-cytokine therapy in DLBCL patients are summarised in Table 60.

An algorithm was set up to manage CRS events: 
Cytokine release syndrome severity 
Prodromal syndrome: 
Low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia 
Cytokine release syndrome requiring 
mild intervention - one or more of the 
following: 
  High fever 
  Hypoxia 
  Mild hypotension 
Cytokine release syndrome requiring 
moderate to aggressive intervention - 
one or more of the following: 
  Haemodynamic instability despite 
intravenous fluids and vasopressor 
support 
  Worsening respiratory distress, 
including pulmonary infiltrates, 
increasing oxygen requirement 
including high-flow oxygen and/or 
need for mechanical ventilation 
  Rapid clinical deterioration 
Management 
Observe in person; exclude infection; administer 
antibiotics per local guidelines if neutropenic; provide 
symptomatic support. 
Administer antipyretics, oxygen, intravenous fluids and/or 
low-dose vasopressors as needed. 
  Administer high-dose or multiple vasopressors, 
oxygen, mechanical ventilation and/or other 
supportive care as needed. 
  Administer tocilizumab. 
-  Patient weight less than 30 kg: 12 mg/kg 
intravenously over 1 hour 
-  Patient weight ≥30 kg: 8 mg/kg intravenously over 
1 hour (maximum dose 800 mg) 
Repeat tocilizumab as needed at a minimum interval of 
8 hours if there is no clinical improvement. 
If no response to second dose of tocilizumab, consider a 
third dose of tocilizumab or pursue alternative measures 
for treatment of cytokine release syndrome. 
Limit to a maximum total of 4 tocilizumab doses. 
 
If no clinical improvement within 12 to 18 hours of the 
first tocilizumab dose, or worsening at any time, 
administer methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg as an initial 
dose, then 2 mg/kg per day until vasopressors and 
high-flow oxygen are no longer needed, then taper.

Infections 
In B-cell ALL patients severe infections (Grade 3 and higher), which can be life-threatening or fatal, 
occurred in 44% of patients after Kymriah infusion. The overall incidence (all grades) was 65% 
(unspecified 49%, viral 32%, bacterial 24% and fungal 15%) (see section 4.4). 43% of the patients 
experienced an infection of any type within 8 weeks after Kymriah infusion. 
In DLBCL patients severe infections (Grade 3 and higher), which can be life-threatening or fatal, 
occurred in 32% of patients. The overall incidence (all grades) was 54% (unspecified 44%, bacterial

In the ALL indication, the SCS Pool, anytime post-tisagenlecleucel infusion ADRs of infections and 
infestations were reported as bacterial infectious disorders in 25% patients, viral infectious disorders in 
33%, fungal infections disorders in 13%, and unspecified infections in 48% of patients. The most 
frequent preferred terms (PTs, reported in >5% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infection 
(11.5%), rhinovirus infection (7.7%), staphylococcal infection (5.8%) and viral upper respiratory tract 
infection (5.8%). 
Patients with active, uncontrolled infections did not start tisagenlecleucel treatment until the infection 
was controlled. Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, infection prophylaxis follows local guidelines based on 
the degree of preceding immunosuppression. After infusion, patients were monitored for signs and 
symptoms of infection and treated appropriately with prophylactic antibiotics. Surveillance testing prior 
to and during treatment with tisagenlecleucel was employed. 
In patients achieving complete remission following tisagenlecleucel treatment, resulting low 
immunoglobulin levels can increase the risk for infections. In patients with low immunoglobulin levels 
pre-emptive measures such as immunoglobulin replacement and rapid attention to signs and 
symptoms of infection are implemented as per age and local specific guidelines. 
Febrile neutropenia 
Severe febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 36% of paediatric and young adult B-cell 
ALL patients and 15% of DLBCL patients (SmPC, section 4.8). Table 63 summarises reported febrile 
neutropenia in both indications:

Cytopenias are very common with Kymriah therapy. In paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients, 
Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias not resolved by day 28 were reported based on laboratory findings and 
included leukopenia (55%), neutropenia (53%), lymphopenia (43%), thrombocytopenia (41%) and 
anaemia (12%)(SmPC, section 4.8).

DLBCL indication 
Table 63 Neurological events within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, regardless of 
study drug relationship, by group term, preferred term and maximum CTC grade (Safety set) 
  DLBCL indication 
Neurological events within 8 weeks post-infusion were reported in 21 patients (21.2%); grade 3 events 
were reported in 8.1% of patients and grade 4 events in 4.0%. The most frequently reported events 
were confusional state (8.1%), encephalopathy (6.1%), and dysphagia (4.0%). 
Among the 21 patients (21.2%) with neurological events within 8 weeks post-infusion, 12 patients 
experienced multiple neurological events. Seventeen of the 21 patients also experienced CRS and 4/21 
patients did not present with CRS. In the 21 patients who experienced a neurological event, there were 
a total of 49 neurological events reported, and of those, 4 events occurred before CRS, 23 events 
during CRS, 6 events after CRS and 16 events in patients with no CRS. 
Cardiac events 
In the SCS Pool, the majority of cardiac events were reported within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel 
infusion in 46 (44.2%) patients (these included events related to fluid resuscitation and acute 
respiratory distress syndrome such as pulmonary oedema, fluid overload, and oedema peripheral, as 
well as tachycardia, dizziness). Any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 49 (47.1%) patients had 
cardiac events; grade 3 events were reported in 14 (13.5%) and grade 4 in 8 (7.7%) of patients. 
Within 8 weeks to 1 year events were reported in 9 patients (9.9%) and after 1 year post-infusion 
cardiac event was reported in 1 of the 29 patients monitored.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within 8 weeks post-infusion, grade 3/4 events were reported in 20 patients (19.2%); 14 with 
maximum grade 3 events and 6 with grade 4 events: 
  Cardiac rhythm-related disorders include tachycardia (24.0%), sinus tachycardia (7.7%), 
bradycardia (2.9%), atrioventricular block first degree (1%), atrioventricular block second 
degree (1%) and sinus bradycardia (1%).  
  Cardiac function-related disorders include left ventricular dysfunction (4.8%), right ventricular 
dysfunction (1.0%), cardiac arrest (1.0%), mitral valve dysfunction (1.0%). 
  Oedema-related events include pulmonary oedema (14.4%), oedema peripheral (6.7%) and 
fluid overload (9.6%) 
The majority, 18 out of 20 patients had grade 3/4 cardiac events concurrent with CRS. 
In the supportive study B2101J, cardiac events were reported anytime post-tisagenlecleucel infusion in 
66.1% of patients with non-CNS3 ALL with 14.3% being grade 3/4, the majority of events occurred 
concurrently with CRS episodes. 
Cardiac events -DLBCL indication 
In the DLBCL Study C2201, 48.6% of patients presented with a cardiac event any time post-infusion. 
The most frequent (≥10% of patients) cardiac events any time post infusion were dyspnoea (17.1%), 
oedema peripheral (15.3%), dizziness (11.7%), and tachycardia (10.8%). Grade 3 events were 
reported in 11.7% of patients and grade 4 events in 3.6%. Except for 3 patients (one patient with a 
grade 3 event of atrial fibrillation, one patient with a grade 3 event of syncope, and one patient with a 
grade 4 event of cardio-respiratory arrest), grade 3 or 4 cardiac events occurred within 8 weeks of the 
infusion. 
Notable cardiac events occurring any time post-infusion included: cardiac arrest (2.7%), cardiac failure 
congestive (0.9%), cardio-respiratory arrest (0.9%), fluid overload (2.7%), pulmonary oedema 
(1.8%), and acute pulmonary oedema (0.9%). Since the data cut-off for the primary CSR analysis, two 
additional patients were reported to have grade 4 cardiac arrest. 
Renal dysfunction requiring dialysis 
In Study B2202, 7 patients underwent renal dialysis for fluid overload and/or renal failure; all events 
occurred during CRS and were attributable to investigational treatment. Four patients in Study B2205J 
had renal dialysis, two of which continued until the patients died. In Study B2202, the number of 
patients that had renal failure (2 patients) was much lower than the patients that had dialysis 
indicating that dialysis was often used primarily just for management of fluid overload.  
No patient in the supportive study B2101J had renal dysfunction requiring dialysis within 28 days post-
infusion. 
Clinically significant bleeding events 
In the SCS Pool, 30 (28.8%) patients had bleeding events within 8 weeks post-infusion; 8 patients had 
grade 3 events and 2 patients had grade 4 events. The most frequently reported events were epistaxis 
reported in 10 patients, disseminated intravascular coagulation (6 patients), haematuria, mouth 
haemorrhage, petechiae, each reported in 5 patients and conjunctional haemorrhage reported in 4 
patients. All other bleeding events were reported in two or fewer patients. Ten patients had bleeding

events >8 weeks to 1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion; three patients had grade 3 events and 1 
patient had grade 4 event. Grade 3/4 bleeding events were reported in 14 (13.5%) patients during 
anytime post-infusion. Among the 84 patients with CRS post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 15 (17.9%) 
patients had bleeding events and blood product support was given for 14 (16.7%) patients.  
In the supportive study B2101J up to the cut-off for this analysis (30-Jan-2017), 14 non-CNS3 ALL 
patients experienced epistaxis post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. Of these, three AEs were grade 3, 
suspected to be study treatment related but resolved within one day with medication or non-drug 
therapy given. One of them was a SAE (Day 6 post-infusion) which resolved with medical therapy 
within one day. Five (10%) non-CNS3 ALL patients out of 50 patients with CRS required blood product 
support specifically for bleeding. No cases of intracranial bleeding were reported.

Based on the pooled data (B2202+B2205J) 39 patients (37.5%) reported AEs related to prolonged 
depletion of normal B-cells (PT ‘hypogammaglobulinaemia). Most of these events were of grade 1/2 
severity, with grade 3 AEs reported in five patients (4.8%) and no patients reported grade 4 AEs. Most 
of the AEs (35 patients, 33.7%) were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel treatment. 
In study C2201, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, one patient had normal levels of CD19+ B-cells 
(normal range: 80-616 cells/μL), while the majority of the patients had CD19+ B-cell levels below 
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ=0.2 cells/μL). After tisagenlecleucel infusion, two patients showed 
CD19+ B-cell levels within normal range (or slightly above normal) as of the data cut-off date. Some 
patients with CD19+ B-cells below LLOQ at pre-infusion visit had detectable CD19+ B-cells at post-
infusion time points (but still below the normal range values). In this study, four patients (4.0%) 
reported AEs related to prolonged depletion of normal B-cells, all of which were suspected to be related 
to tisagenlecleucel treatment and all the events were ongoing at the time of the cut-off date. Of these, 
one patient reported grade 3 AE and was treated with immunoglobulins. No patient reported grade 4 
AE. No SAEs or fatalities associated with AEs of prolonged depletion of normal B-cells were reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
  ALL indication - Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported in 77.9% of infused patients. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 25 (24%) 
patients; grade 3 in 24 (23.1%) patients and grade 4 in 1 patient. Grade 3/4 hypotension was 
reported in 12 (13.2%) patients, and is a known consequence of CRS.

Table 64 Serious adverse events post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, regardless of study drug 
relationship, preferred term, maximum grade (>3 patients, all patients, all grades) in SCS 
Pool (Safety set) 
In study B2202 in total 71 patients (94.7%) had at least one hospitalization and most patients 
required 1 or 2 hospitalizations. Among patients with at least one hospitalization, the median total 
duration of hospitalization was 29.0 days (range 5 to 214 days). There were 40 patients admitted to 
the ICU, and the median duration of intensive care unit stay was 7 days (range from 0.5 to 51) among 
these 40 patients. 
In study B2101J SAEs occurred in 89.3% of non-CNS3 ALL patients at any time post tisagenlecleucel 
infusion. The most common (≥ 20% of patients) SAEs were CRS (82.1%), febrile neutropenia 
(71.4%), hypotension (39.3%), encephalopathy (26.8%) and pyrexia (23.2%). The majority of 
patients (83.9%) had at least one SAE which was related to study treatment. The frequency of febrile 
neutropenia and hypotension was higher in Study B2101J compared to the SCS pool. 
  DLBCL indication - serious adverse events 
At the time of the 08.12.17 cut-off, 72 patients (64.9%) had at least one SAE regardless of study drug 
relationship. Serious adverse events with suspected relationship to study drug were reported in 52 
patients (46.8%). Serious AEs occurred more frequently within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
(49.5%) than >8 weeks to one year post-tisagenlecleucel (29.2%) 
The most frequent SAEs (reported in >5% of patients) regardless of study drug relationship were CRS 
(27.0%), febrile neutropenia (8.1%), and pyrexia (7.2%). Most of these SAEs were suspected to be 
related to study drug. These SAEs were expected CRS-related events and were managed by standard 
supportive care and concomitant medications and, when indicated, anti-cytokine therapy per the 
protocol-defined CRS algorithm in a hospital setting.

ALL indication – deaths 
Among the 127 enrolled patients, 18 died prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, which included 10 deaths 
due to disease progression and 8 deaths due to AEs, mainly infections (6 cases - pneumonia in 3 
patients, fungal infections in 2 patients, and sepsis in 1 patient). There were 4 deaths within 30 days of 
tisagenlecleucel infusion: 2 patients died due to disease progression, 1 due to cerebral hemorrhage in 
the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and 1 due to embolic stroke from an 
intracardiac mucormycotic mass. No deaths occurred within 30 days of first tisagenlecleucel infusion in 
Study B2101J. Two patients died during the LD chemotherapy period due to multi-organ dysfunction 
syndrome failure and respiratory failure. 
Four patients died within 30 days of tisagenlecleucel infusion; 2 due to disease progression and 2 due 
to nervous system disorders (one cerebral haemorrhage in the setting of DIC, causality was related to 
multiple factors including chemotherapy and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVH); and 
one embolic stroke from an intracardiac mucormycotic mass, causality was related to lympho-depleting 
chemotherapy). 
Twenty-five patients died more than 30 days after tisagenlecleucel infusion, including 20 due to 
disease progression. All the remaining 5 deaths occurred in Study B2202, 3 patients died due to 
infections; namely encephalitis (related to viral infection/tisagenlecleucel/autoimmune), lower 
respiratory tract bacterial infection (not related to study drug) and systemic mycosis (related to 
tisagenlecleucel/prolonged pancytopenia that predated tisagenlecleucel infusion), one due to 
hepatobiliary disease (not related to study drug), and one death was due to unknown reason.

Table 66 Deaths by preferred term for SCS Pool (Enrolled set) 
In supportive study B2101J at the time of the data cut-off (30-Jan-2017), 22 non-CNS3 ALL patients 
(39.3%) had died any time following their first tisagenlecleucel infusion, all due to disease progression. 
No deaths were reported within 30 days of the first tisagenlecleucel infusion whereas 3 non- CNS3 ALL 
patients (5.4%) died within 30 days from the time of the last tisagenlecleucel infusion; (16, 22 and 27 
days after last infusion). 
Laboratory findings 
  ALL indication 
Haematology 
Grade 3/4 hematopoietic cytopenias not resolved by Day 28 were seen among patients who received 
tisagenlecleucel and are discussed above under AESIs. Although data for long term follow-up are 
limited, the occurrence of higher grades haematology parameters generally decreased over time 
indicating resolution of the events. 
Clinical chemistry 
Based on CTC grade, new or worsened biochemistry abnormalities were reported mainly as grade 1/2. 
Most commonly reported (in at least 5 patients) worst post-baseline grade 3 biochemistry 
abnormalities within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were for hypokalaemia (21.2%), bilirubin 
(17.3%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (16.3%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (16.3%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phosphate (11.5%), hyperglycaemia (8.7%), creatinine (5.8%), hyponatremia (5.8%). Worst post-
baseline grade 4 biochemistry abnormalities within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were 
reported for AST (10.6%), phosphate (4.8%), hypokalaemia (3.8%), ALT (2.9%), urate (2.9%), 
creatinine (1.9%), hyperglycaemia (1.9%), hypernatremia (1%), hyponatremia (1.0%), and bilirubin 
(1%). 
The proportion of patients with worst post-baseline grade 3/4 biochemistry abnormalities decreased at 
further timepoints >8 weeks to 1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion with no post-baseline grade 3/4 
biochemistry abnormalities >1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
The most commonly reported biochemistry abnormalities (in >15% for all patients) that worsened 
from grade 0/2 to grade 3/4 post-baseline, post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were for AST (28.8%), 
potassium (26.5%), ALT (19.5%), bilirubin (17.5%), and phosphate (15.5%). 
Hepatic reactions: In the SCS pool ALT or AST > 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) & bilirubin > 2x ULN & 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) < 2x ULN within 8 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion (seen in 19 
patients) were not observed at any time >8 weeks post-infusion. These abnormalities occurred during 
and toward the end of CRS and were reversible. In Study B2101J, there were 5 non-CNS3 ALL patients 
with concurrent ALT or AST > 3x ULN & bilirubin > 2x ULN & ALP < 2x ULN within 8 weeks after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. One patient had concurrent ALT or AST > 3x ULN & bilirubin > 2x ULN & ALP 
< 2x ULN between 8 weeks to 1 year with no events occurring post 1 year. 
Generation of replication competent lentivirus (RCL) 
No positive replication-competent lentivirus findings were reported in Studies B2202, B2205J and 
B2101J. 
Electrocardiograms/echogardiograms 
In Study B2202 and B2205J, evaluation of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) (locally assessed) was 
assessed at Screening and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. In Study B2202 and B2205J, there were 
no scheduled ECG assessments post tisagenlecleucel infusion in this study. In Study B2202, ECG 
assessments at Screening, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion and unscheduled visits shows infrequent 
significant abnormalities (7 patients). In Study B2101J echocardiograms were taken during the 
apheresis visit prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. No or only clinically insignificant cardiac abnormalities 
were detected. There were no scheduled ECG assessments post tisagenlecleucel infusion in this study. 
  DLBCL indication  
 Clinical chemistry 
Most newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities reported post-tisagenlecleucel 
infusion were low in severity (grade 1/2). 
The most frequently reported new or worsened grade 3 toxicities any time post infusion were 
hypophosphatemia (23.4%), hypokalaemia (12.6%), hypoalbuminemia ), and hyponatremia both 
(9.9%), hyperbilirubinemia, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increased blood creatinine 
(5.4% each), and hypermagnesemia (3.0%). New or worsened grade 4 biochemistry abnormalities 
were reported for urate in 4 patients (3.6%), aspartate aminotransferase in two patients (1.8%), and 
bilirubin, hypophosphatemia and hyponatremia in one patient each (0.9%). Liver enzyme 
abnormalities generally occurred within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel (during and towards the end of 
CRS), and were reversible.

Haematology 
Shifts of haematology values to grade 3 or 4 (e.g. low lymphocytes, leukocytes, platelet and neutrophil 
counts) were most frequently seen within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, and declined 
substantially from 8 weeks to 1 year post-infusion.  
B-cell aplasia (data based on follow-up of 99 infused patients): Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, i.e. at 
the pre-infusion visit, only 1 patient had normal levels of CD19+ B cells (normal range: 80-616 
cells/μL), while the majority of the patients had CD19+ B cell levels below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) (0.2 cells/μL). After tisagenlecleucel infusion, 2 patients showed CD19+ B cell 
levels within normal range (or slightly above normal) as of of the data cut-off (08-March- 2017). Some 
patients with CD19+ B cells below the LLOQ at the pre-infusion visit had detectable CD19+ B cells at 
post-infusion time points (but still below the normal range values). It should be noted that post-
infusion B cell results can be influenced by duration of the follow-up period, and the patients’ B cell 
levels could further increase over time. The impact of tisagenlecleucel on B-cell aplasia during the 
study cannot be directly ascertained due to the confounding effect of high rituximab levels in the 
majority of patients post-infusion (i.e. at Day 7 and Day 21). Rituximab-mediated B–cell aplasia is 
expected to last approximately 6 months to 1 year based on the terminal half-life (T1/2) of rituximab, 
i.e. 22 days. However, it is possible that tisagenlecleucel could contribute to or cause sustained 
aplasia. 
Safety in special populations 
  ALL indication 
In the SCS Pool, 40 patients were <10 years, 44 patients were ≥ 10 to < 18 years and 20 patients 
were ≥ 18 years. The frequency and nature of events were reported in similar proportions of patients 
among the age subgroups. 
UDLBCL indication 
Populations according to molecular subtype (cell of origin):  
Patients with germinal centre B-cell of origin comprised 51.5% and patients with activated B-cell type 
comprised 42.4% of infused patients. The incidence rate of AEs overall and grade 3/4 AEs was similar 
in both subtypes.

Serious adverse event cases on tisagenlecleucel retrieved from the [company] ARGUS database are 
presented by case and SAE counts, age group and seriousness criteria in Table 72. 
Table 68 Courts of cases and events (preferred terms) of tisagenlecleucel from the Novartis safety 
database (cut-off: 08 December 2017 
Considering the known age distribution in study C2201 with > 75 % of patients being younger than 65 
years of age, the incidence of SAE cases and SAEs appear comparable between patients < 65 years 
and ≥ 65 to 74 years. As anticipated for patients of advanced age, the death rate appeared to be 
higher in the older age group although the numbers were overall small. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
No data provided in the current studies for any of the two indications. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
During lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
In the SCS Pool, 60 patients (59.4%) experienced at least one AE (regardless of study drug 
relationship) requiring medication or therapy during LD chemotherapy; 15 patients (14.9%) due to 
grade 3 events and 13 patients (12.9%) due to grade 4 events. 
Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
Within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 98 patients (94.2%) experienced at least one AE 
(regardless of study drug relationship) requiring medication or therapy; 30 patients (28.8%) due to 
grade 3 events and 48 patients (46.2%) due to grade 4 events. Between 8 weeks and 1 year post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion, 65 patients (71.4%) experienced at least one AE requiring medication or 
therapy; 14 patients (15.4%) due to grade 3 events and 15 patients (16.5%) due to grade 4 events.

After 1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 6 patients (20.7%) experienced at least one AE requiring 
medication or therapy; 2 patients due to grade 3 events and 1 patient due to grade 4 event. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
  ALL indication 
During pre-treatment period 
In the SCS Pool, 10 patients (7.9%) experienced at least one AE (regardless of study drug 
relationship) leading to study discontinuation during the pre-treatment period; grade 3 in 2 patients 
and grade 4 in 7 patients. The AEs leading to study discontinuation were due to infections and 
infestations in 5 patients (grade 4 in 4 patients: aspergillus infection, pneumonia, pneumonia fungal 
and trichosporon infection; grade 3 in 1 patient: systemic mycosis), metabolism and nutrition disorders 
in 2 patients (hypoalbuminemia and grade 4 tumour lysis syndrome), and due to the PTs multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome (grade 4), graft versus host disease (grade 3), haemorrhage intracranial 
(grade 4) and respiratory failure (grade 4) in one patient each. 
During lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
In the SCS Pool, 2 patients (2.0%) experienced at least one AE (regardless of study drug relationship) 
leading to study discontinuation during LD chemotherapy; both patients experienced at least 1 grade 4 
event. 
Post tisagenlecleucel infusion 
Within 8 weeks post tisagenlecleucel infusion, 2 patients in the SCS Pool, one from Study B2202 (due 
to grade 4 candida infection) and one from Study B2205J (due to grade 4 embolic stroke) experienced 
an AE (regardless of study drug relationship) leading to study discontinuation. Between 8 weeks and 1 
year post tisagenlecleucel infusion, one patient had an event of cardiac arrest (grade 4) that led to 
study discontinuation. No AEs leading to discontinuation were reported after 1 year. 
  DLBCL indication 
AEs leading to study discontinuation that occurred within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were 
reported in 3 patients (2.7%); 1 patient (0.9%) due to febrile neutropenia, 1 patient (0.9%) due to 
aspiration pneumonia and 1 patient (0.9%) due to pulmonary haemorrhage. 
Further, 3 additional patients discontinued the study due to an AE that occurred more than 8 weeks 
and less than 1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion; reasons were: AE of grade 4 cerebral 
haemorrhage, an AE of grade 3 chronic kidney disease (note: the patient had a medical history that 
included bladder cancer, kidney fibrosis and renal failure – the patient who died from chronic kidney 
disease) and a grade 4 infection.  
None of the AEs leading to study discontinuation were considered to have a relationship to 
tisagenlecleucel treatment.

Post marketing experience 
Tisagenlecleucel is approved since 30 August 2017 by the FDA for the treatment of patients up to 25 
years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. However no post 
marketing data was available at the time of the submission of the MAA. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
  ALL indication 
The safety assessment is based on two phase II clinical trials and one phase I/IIa study including in 
total 104 evaluable patients. Median follow-up have been 6.37 months, 9.9 months and 11.5 months. 
The most common non haematological adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (77%), 
infections (65%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (47%), pyrexia (40%) and decreased appetite 
(39%)(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were reported in 88% of patients. The most common Grade 3 and 4 
non haematological adverse reaction was cytokine release syndrome (47%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The most common Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were white blood cells 
decreased (99%), neutrophils decreased (95%), lymphocytes decreased (95%), platelets decreased 
(77%) and haemoglobin decreased (53%)(SmPC, section 4.8). 
All patients infused experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE).The most frequently reported AEs post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion suspected to be study drug related were cytokine related syndrome (CRS) 
(80.8%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (32.7%), pyrexia (28.8%), febrile neutropenia (27.9%), 
hypotension (26.9%), decreased appetite (25.0%), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased 
(23.1%). 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were more often observed within the initial 8 weeks post infusion 
(83% of patients) compared to after 8 weeks post infusion (46% of patients) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The most frequently reported SAEs post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were CRS (64.4%), febrile 
neutropenia (24.0%), and hypotension (11.5%). Serious adverse events were more frequently 
reported within the initial 8 weeks post-infusion (71.2% of patients; with grade 3 SAEs in 27.9% of 
patients and grade 4 in 35.6%) compared with >8 weeks to 1 year (31.9% of patients; grade 3 in 
18.7% and grade 4 in 13.2%). 
Eighteen (14.2%) among the 127 enrolled patients died prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, which 
included 10 deaths due to disease progression and 8 deaths due to other causes, mainly infections (6 
cases). There were 4 (3.8%) deaths within 30 days of tisagenlecleucel infusion: 2 patients died due to 
disease progression, 1 due to cerebral haemorrhage in the setting of disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC) and 1 due to embolic stroke from an intracardiac mucormycotic mass. No deaths 
occurred within 30 days of first tisagenlecleucel infusion in Study B2101J. Any time 30 days after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion 25 (24.0%) died, 20 (19.2%) due to disease progression. 
No differences in efficacy or safety were observed between different age subgroups (SmPC, section 
4.8). 
Assessment report

  DLBCL indication 
The safety assessment is based on 111 adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as per the third analysis presented in the addendum 2, in trial C2201. Median 
follow-up from the primary analysis has increased from 3.7 months to 13.9 months. 
All except 1 patient experienced an adverse event (AE) post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (note: the 
patient with no AE received tisagenlecleucel infusion on the day of the data cut -off). 
The most common non-haematological adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (58%), 
infections (54%), pyrexia (35%), diarrhoea (32%), nausea (29%), hypotension (26%) and fatigue 
(26%). The most common (>25%) Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were 
lymphocyte count decreased (95%), neutrophil count decreased (81%), white blood cell count 
decreased (77%), haemoglobin decreased (59%) and platelet count decreased (55%). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 64% of patients. The relationship of adverse events to 
treatment with tisagenlecleucel can be difficult to assess due to the temporal proximity of 
chemotherapy to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimens were received by 
92.8% of patients infused with tisagenlecleucel. AEs with a suspected relationship to tisagenlecleucel 
treatment any time post-infusion were reported for most (89.2%) patients. 
Adverse reactions to tisagenlecleucel treatment within 8 weeks after infusion were reported in 86.5% 
of patients. Grade 3/4 AEs with a suspected relationship to tisagenlecleucel treatment were reported in 
70 patients (63.1%); grade 3 in 32.4% and grade 4 in 30.6% of patients. Adverse reactions were 
primarily observed in the first 8 weeks post-infusion. Adverse reactions after 8 weeks post-infusion 
were reported in 31.3%. AEs with a suspected relationship to tisagenlecleucel treatment that occurred 
more than 1 year post-infusion were reported in 2 patients (one patient with leukopenia and one 
patient with respiratory tract infection, both AEs <grade 3). 
Three patients died within 30 days post-infusion, all due to lymphoma progression. An additional 47 
deaths occurred more than 30 days post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 42 of which were due to lymphoma 
progression, and three due to chronic kidney disease, pulmonary haemorrhage and sepsis, 
respectively. 
  Both indications 
The safety profile for patients treated with tisagenlecleucel is influenced by cytotoxic chemotherapy 
involved in bridging therapy and lymphodepletion pre-tisagenlecleucel infusion and medication needed 
to treat AEs post-tisagenlecleucel infusion like antibiotics, gammaglobulines, antipyretics and anti-IL-6 
based therapy (tocilizumab).  
Overall, the safety profile is similar in both ALL in children and DLBCL in adults, with minor differences 
in frequency. One difference between the two patient groups is that many of the DLBCL patients have 
been treated with rituximab pre-tisagenlecleucel infusion, which may have influence on the pattern of 
AEs observed post-tisagenlecleucel. 
AESIs were CRS, infections, neurological events, TLS, hypogammaglobulinaemia, febrile neutropenia, 
infections and hematopoietic cytopenias. All of these are serious and can be life-threatening. For the 
B/R of the product it is important this can be managed in a correct and prompt way, in particular the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRS, infections and febrile neutropenia. Additional risk minimisation measures are important including 
the proposed CRS algorithm and educational material/guiding documents on AEs to be expected, time 
to onset, how to handle them and the expected duration of these events. Such information material 
should be part of special education of all kind of HCPs treating the patients from enrolment to 
tisagenlecleucel therapy until post-tisagenlecleucel infusion period. For the patients it is as well of 
greatest importance to get information about what AEs to be expected and how they or their carers 
should react when symptoms appear. 
The most frequently reported AEs post-tisagenlecleucel infusion suspected to be study drug related 
were CRS (ALL indication: 80.8% in the SCS Pool and 89.3% in study B2101J, DLBCL indication 
57.7%). CRS was reversible in most cases and was managed with supportive care and as-needed anti-
cytokine therapy (tocilizumab was required in 41.7% of patients). Approximately half of the patients 
with CRS required intensive care unit level care (56.0%) at a median of 6 days after the infusion, 
where they remained for a median duration of 7 days.  
The frequency of deaths reported in DLBCL patients have increase over time, which is expected for 
patient groups included in this clinical trial. It may be anticipated that additional information on clinical 
safety will be gathered via the routine post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities. 
The most serious and life-threatening AE is CRS observed in 81% of ALL patients and in 38% in DLBCL 
patients. CRS occurred between 1 to 11 days (median onset: 3 days) in ALL patients and between 1-9 
days (median 3 days) in the DLBCL patients. All occurred within first 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel 
infusion. CRS was one of events associated with three cases of fatal outcome. To prevent CRS being 
life-threatening, a revised algorithm with minor changes from the one used in the clinical trials, is 
proposed for managing this AE.  
Cytokine release syndrome, including fatal or life-threatening events, has been frequently observed 
after Kymriah infusion (see SmPC section 4.8). In almost all cases, development of cytokine release 
syndrome occurred between 1 to 10 days (median onset 3 days) after Kymriah infusion. The median 
time to resolution of cytokine release syndrome was 7 days(SmPC, section 4.4). 
Symptoms of cytokine release syndrome may include high fever, rigors, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, diaphoresis, rash, anorexia, fatigue, headache, hypotension, encephalopathy, 
dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and hypoxia. Additional organ system adverse reactions, including transient 
cardiac insufficiency and arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated bilirubin have been observed. In some cases, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with low fibrinogen levels, capillary leak syndrome 
(CLS), and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) have 
been reported in the setting of cytokine release syndrome. Patients should be closely monitored for 
signs or symptoms of these events, including fever (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Risk factors for severe cytokine release syndrome in paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients 
are: high pre-infusion tumour burden, uncontrolled or accelerating tumour burden following 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy, active infection and early onset of fever or cytokine release syndrome 
following Kymriah infusion. Risk factors for developing severe cytokine release syndrome in adult 
DLBCL patients are not known (SmPC, section 4.4). 
In all indications, appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for infections should be provided, 
and complete resolution of any existing infections should be ensured. Infections may also occur during 
cytokine release syndrome and may increase the risk of a fatal event (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Cytokine release syndrome is managed solely based on clinical presentation and according to the 
cytokine release syndrome management algorithm provided in Table 1. Anti-IL-6 based therapy such 
Assessment report

as tocilizumab has been administered for moderate or severe cytokine release syndrome associated 
with Kymriah and a minimum of four doses of tocilizumab must be on site and available for 
administration prior to Kymriah infusion. Corticosteroids may be administered in cases of 
life-threatening emergencies. Tisagenlecleucel continues to expand and persist following administration 
of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be 
managed by standards of critical care and measures such as echocardiography should be considered. 
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists are not recommended for management of 
Kymriah-associated cytokine release syndrome (SmPC, section 4.4). Cytokine release syndrome has 
been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Neurological events are AEs of concern, observed in 38% in ALL patients and in 21% in DLBCL 
patients. These events were often seen as part of the CRS, in particular with high fever and occurred 
within few days following tisagenlecleucel infusion. Neurological events occurring first 8 weeks post-
infusion is called “early” neurological events. The majority of neurologic events occurred first 30 days 
after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Most common symptoms were agitation, encephalopathy, seizures, 
tremor, confusional state, delirium, irritability and somnolence. The majority of neurological events 
resolved completely, however, 7% of patients with neurological events with ALL indication and 5% with 
the DLBC indication were not recovered at the time of cut-off. History of CNS disease is considered a 
risk factor. Treatment with tocilizumab did not reverse the symptoms. No neurological events are 
suggested to be part of any death. It is not clear if delayed or late neurological events (occurring >8 
weeks post-infusion) have been observed. In a recent publication [33], neurotoxicity associated with 
CAR-T cells are mentioned CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy (CRES) and a management guide is 
proposed. This guide is considered useful for HCPs and is included in the educational material for HCPs. 
Other manifestations included seizures, aphasia and speech disorder. The majority of neurological 
events occurred within 8 weeks following Kymriah infusion and were transient. The median time to 
onset of neurological events was 7 days in B-cell ALL and DLBCL. The median time to resolution was 
7 days for B-cell ALL and 12 days for DLBCL. Neurological events can be concurrent with cytokine 
release syndrome, following resolution of cytokine release syndrome or in the absence of cytokine 
release syndrome. Patients should be monitored for neurological events. In case of neurological 
events, patients should be diagnostically worked-up and managed depending on the underlying 
pathophysiology and in accordance to local standard of care (SmPC, section 4.4). Serious neurological 
adverse reactions have been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Due to the time sequence and frequency of severe CRS and (early) neurological events > Grade 3, 
patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of 
potential cytokine release syndrome, neurological events and other toxicities. Physicians should 
consider hospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion. After the first 10 days following the infusion, 
the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion. Patients should be instructed to remain 
within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion (SmPC, section 
4.2). 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia was seen in 45% in the ALL indication and in 15% in DLBCL indication. 
Immunoglobulin replacement therapy was given in 19.2% of those with hypogammaglobulinemia in 
the DLBCL indication. Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Kymriah. In 
patients with low immunoglobulin levels pre-emptive measures such as infection precautions, antibiotic 
prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement should be taken according to age and standard 
guidelines (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Patients treated with Kymriah may develop secondary malignancies or recurrence of their cancer. Life-
long for secondary malignancies should be monitored. In the event that a secondary malignancy 
Assessment report

occurs, the company should be contacted to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing 
(SmPC, section 4.4). 
Based on the pooled data (B2202+B2205J) 39 patients (37.5%) reported AEs related to prolonged 
depletion of normal B-cells. In study C2201, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, one patient had normal 
levels of CD19+ B-cells (normal range: 80-616 cells/μL), while the majority of the patients had CD19+ 
B-cell levels below lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ=0.2 cells/μL). Transient or prolonged B-cell 
depletion is a risk with tisagenlecleucel therapy, since normal B-cells express CD19. Prolonged 
depletion of normal B cells/ agammaglobulinemia has been categorized as identified risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
Hematopoietic cytopenias was seen in 36% of both ALL and DLBCL patients and was observed within 
28 days as well as several months post-tisagenlecleucel. Management was blood product support, 
growth factors and/or antibiotics as indicated. Myeloid growth factors are not recommended until CRS 
has been resolved and typically not before 28 days have elapsed following tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Hematopoietic cytopenias not resolved by 28 days have been categorized as identified risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
Pyrexia (41% in the ALL indication and 35% in DLBCL indication) and febrile neutropenia (36% in ALL 
indication, 16% in DLBCL indication) were managed with standard practice of hospital admission, 
culture surveillance, antibiotics and supportive care. 
Infections were seen caused by several different pathogens related to respiratory infections, urinary 
tract infections, gastrointestinal infections etc. Bacteria, viral as well as fungal infections were seen and 
treated with antibiotics according to local guidance.  
Patients with active, uncontrolled infection should not start Kymriah treatment until the infection is 
resolved. Prior to Kymriah infusion, infection prophylaxis should follow standard guidelines based on 
the degree of preceding immunosuppression. Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal 
infections, occurred frequently in patients after Kymriah infusion. Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of infection and treated appropriately. As appropriate, prophylactic antibiotics 
should be administered and surveillance testing should be employed prior to and during treatment with 
Kymriah. Infections are known to complicate the course and management of concurrent cytokine 
release syndrome (SmPC, section 4.4). Infections have been categorized as identified risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
Febrile neutropenia was frequently observed in patients after Kymriah infusion and may be concurrent 
with cytokine release syndrome. In the event of febrile neutropenia, infection should be evaluated and 
managed appropriately with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, as medically 
indicated (SmPC, section 4.4). 
In patients achieving complete remission following Kymriah, resulting low immunoglobulin levels can 
increase the risk for infections. Attention to signs and symptoms of infection should be implemented 
according to age and standard specific guidelines (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Patients may continue to exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following Kymriah infusion and should be 
managed according to standard guidelines. The majority of patients who had cytopenias at day 28 
following Kymriah treatment resolved to Grade 2 or below within three months after treatment. 
Prolonged neutropenia has been associated with increased risk of infection. Myeloid growth factors, 
particularly granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have the potential to worsen 
cytokine release syndrome symptoms and are not recommended during the first 3 weeks after 
Kymriah infusion or until cytokine release syndrome has resolved (SmPC, section 4.4).

Delayed toxicity of hematologic origin (e.g., such as myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anaemia, bone 
marrow failure) has been associated with prior treatment with chemotherapy and radiation and were 
observed in the tisagenlecleucel development program. Haematological disorders (incl. aplastic 
anaemia and bone marrow failure) have been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
Two cases of fatal cerebral oedema and one case of papilledema have been observed post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion. All the 2 fatal events clearly present the pathophysiological consequence of 
preceding events and conditions that are considered the primary aetiology of the death in these 
patients. Therefore, these 2 events must be unmistakably distinguished from the clinical pattern of 
fatal cerebral oedema observed with the JCAR015 product. Therefore cerebral oedema has been 
categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Based on the pooled (B2202+B2205J) 39 patients (37.5%) reported AEs related to hypersensitivity. 
Most of these patients (31 out of 39) had events that were of grade 1/2 severity, with grade 3 AEs 
reported in seven patients (6.7%) and grade 4 AE reported in one patient. The most frequent PTs 
(reported in >5% of patients) were rash (9.6%) and face oedema (8.7%). In study C2201 15 patients 
(15.2%) reported AEs related to hypersensitivity, all of which were of grade 1/2 severity.  
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Kymriah treatment has not been 
studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start 
of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Kymriah treatment, and until immune recovery following 
treatment with Kymriah (SmPC section 4.4). 
TLS, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. To minimise risk of TLS, patients with 
elevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, prior 
to Kymriah infusion. Signs and symptoms of TLS should be monitored and events managed according 
to standard guidelines (SmPC section 4.4). Tumour lysis syndrome has been categorized as identified 
risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was reported in one patient (study B2202). The patient hadgrade 1 
GVHD in the past, but it was not ongoing at the time of the study entry. There were no patients with 
GVHD in study C2201. Aggravation of graft-versus-host disease has been categorized as potential risk 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
Modulation of an individual’s immune status (such as what occurs with chemotherapy and CRS) can 
cause an exacerbation of a pre-existing autoimmune disorder. No AEs were observed in the clinical 
trials. New occurence or exacerbation of an autoimmune disorder has been categorized as potential 
risk (see Risk Management Plan).No AEs were observed in the clinical trials. 
Patients with a history of active CNS disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac 
function were excluded from the studies. These patients are likely to be more vulnerable to the 
consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require special attention (SmPC section 
4.4). 
It is not recommended that patients receive Kymriah within 4 months of undergoing an allogeneic 
stem cell transplant (SCT) because of the potential risk of Kymriah worsening GVHD. Leukapheresis for 
Kymriah manufacturing should be performed at least 12 weeks after allogeneic SCT (SmPC section 
4.4). 
HBV reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in 
patients treated with medicinal products directed against B cells. There is currently no experience with 
manufacturing Kymriah for patients testing positive for HBV, HCV and HIV.Screening for HBV, HCV and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 166 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV must be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for 
manufacturing (SmPC section 4.4). 
Due to limited short spans of identical genetic information between the lentiviral vector used to create 
Kymriah and HIV, some commercial HIV nucleic acid tests (NAT) may give a false positive result( 
SmPC section 4.4). 
Long-term safety is for the time being considered missing information. Regular reporting from the 
follow-up until 24 months and 60 months of the ongoing studies is of importance. Two studies are 
planned for follow-up of long-term safety in 15 years, one the follow up of ALL patients in study B2205 
and a PASS for all B-cell lymphomas (see RMP). 
Inappropriate handling of the manufactured product including transport, storage in addition to thawing 
and standing time prior to infusion may result in a decrease of viable cells. This may impact the 
efficacy and safety profile of tisagenlecleucel. Decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of 
the product has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Missing information in several patient groups: safety during use in pregnancy and lactation, safety in 
patients with HIV/HBV/HCV, safety in patients with active CNS, involvement by malignancy, 
immunogenicity and long-term safety. Routine risk minimization activities recommend specific clinical 
measures to address these (see Risk Management Plan). 
Kymriah has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.Due to the potential for 
neurological events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving Kymriah are at risk 
for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following infusion (SmPC, 
section 4.7). 
This medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells. Healthcare professionals 
handling Kymriah should therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid 
potential transmission of infectious diseases. (SmPC, section 4.2). Transmission of infectious agents 
has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
UControlled distribution program 
A controlled distribution program is proposed in the RMP as additional risk minimization activity to 
mitigate the risk associated with Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) by ensuring that hospitals and their 
associated centres that dispense Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) are specially qualified and have on-site, 
immediate access to tocilizumab. 
To mitigate the risk and minimize the occurrence of severe or life-threatening CRS and neurological 
toxicities by ensuring that those who prescribe, dispense, and administer Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) 
have completed the educational program, and have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab. Patients 
receiving Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) treatment will be counselled by treating clinician in treatment 
risks including CRS and neurological toxicities, and will be provided with a patient reminder card, 
besides the package leaflet. 
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) will only be supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified 
and only if the healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the 
educational program, and have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab. 
This program is endorsed and is supposed to include management of all types of expected serious AEs.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Serious and life-threatening AEs, in particular CRS, have been observed in most patients, across 
indications in particular first eight weeks post- Kymriah infusion. These AEs are considered manageable 
with the appropriate risk minimisation measures in place. Furthermore, post authorisation studies will 
further investigate the safety and long term safety of Kymriah. The registry will also evaluate safety of 
tisagenlecleucel in B-ALL patients below the age of 3 years treated in the commercial setting. In 
addition, follow up data on the pivotal study C2201 will be submitted by the applicant. Finally study 
CCTL019H2301 is a randomized open-label parallel-group multicenter Phase III trial designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
aggressive NHL after failure of rituximab and anthracycline containing first line immunochemotherapy.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
  Non-interventional PASS: In order to further characterise the safety including long-term 
safety of Kymriah, the applicant should conduct and submit a study based on data from a 
disease registry in ALL and DLBCL patients. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

The effectiveness of risk minimisation measures will be assessed by analysis of data obtained in the 
proposed registry study (CTL019B2401). 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The PRAC Rapporteur, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

Observational study in DLBCL (Category 1) 
Novartis will conduct a prospective, observational PAES study in order to further evaluate the efficacy 
of tisagenlecleucel in patients with r/r DLBCL. Efficacy outcome measures will be line with those 
evaluated in study C2201. In addition, details of the manufacturing turnaround time (i.e., including 
time from last relapse or confirmed refractory status, time from decision to treat, and time from 
leukapheresis to infusion) will be reported. 
Subgroup analysis will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness in 1) all included patients, 2) 
patients matching the population in C2201 and 3) patients matching the population in the CORAL 
extension studies (i.e. receiving third line treatment or having relapsed after SCT). In addition, 
subgroup analysis based on important prognostic covariates will be performed. Details of the 
manufacturing turnaround time, (i.e. time from last relapse or confirmed refractory status, time from 
decision to treat, and time from leukapheresis to infusion) will be reported.  
Milestone: The study protocol will be submitted within 3 months of the European Commission decision. 
Study CCTL019C2201  
The following reports will be prepared for pivotal study C2201 in order to further characterize long-
term efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in r/r DLBCL:  


Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP/CAT  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The IBD is 30.08.2017. The applicant did request 
international harmonisation of the PSUR cycle by using the forthcoming Data Lock Point 12.02.2019. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that tisagenlecleucel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tisagenlecleucel to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) is included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 178 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indications are as follows: 
Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of: 
 
 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
• 
ALL indication 
For r/r ALL treatment options include high-dose chemotherapy with subsequent allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT), standard chemo-immunotherapy, targeted treatment with small molecule 
pathway inhibitors, or supportive care with non-curative palliative goals. Allogeneic SCT is the only 
potentially curative option for r/r pALL, but outcomes are suboptimal. Among r/r pALL patients who 
received allogeneic SCT in third or later remission, received allogeneic SCT with active disease or 
received allogeneic SCT after relapse from previous allogeneic SCT, the 1-year overall survival (OS) 
rates are in 25 to 55% range and 5-year OS rates are generally in 20 to 45% range. 
For Ph+ patients, dasatinib (Sprycel) was approved in 2006 for the treatment of adult patients with 
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib (Iclusig) was approved in 2013 for the treatment 
of adult patients with Ph+ ALL who are resistant to/ intolerant of dasatinib. Blincyto (blinatumomab), a 
bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the treatment of adults with Ph- 
relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL.  
Despite the current treatment modalities, maintaining a remission in relapsed patients is difficult, the 
patients are being hospitalized for a long period of time with a poor QoL, and the prognosis of patients 
with r/r ALL still remains poor. 
  DLBCL indication 
The front-line standard of care for patients with DLBCL includes a combination of CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) with rituximab (R-CHOP). Although 
rituximab has markedly improved the prognosis of DLBCL patients, 30-50% do not have long-term 
benefit from first-line therapy (approximately 30% relapse and 20% have refractory disease). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 179 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended second-line therapy for patients with r/r DLBCL (<65-70 years) is salvage regimens with 
rituximab and chemotherapy (i.e. R-DHAP, R-ICE, R-GDP) followed, in responsive patients 
(approximately 40-60%), by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and ASCT. For patients who are ineligible 
for ASCT or relapse following ASCT, treatment options are more limited and for most patients the 
prognosis is poor. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
• 
ALL indication  
The clinical package of Kymriah for the ALL indication was primarily supported by data from a Phase II, 
single arm, multicentre trial designed to determine the efficacy and safety of CTL019 in paediatric and 
young adult patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL (Study B2202). 
 
DLBCL indication 
Study C2201 is an open-label, multicentre, single arm phase 2 study designed to determine the 
efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r DLBCL (including DLBCL arising from 
TFL) who are ineligible for ASCT after ≥ 2 prior lines of chemotherapy (including rituximab and 
anthracycline).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
ALL indication 
The primary endpoint (superiority of ORR compared to a historic control ORR of 20%) was met at the 
April 25, 2017 cut-off. Best ORR within 3 months was 66.3% (95% CI: (55.7, 75.8). Forty five patients 
(48.9%) had a best response of CR, and 16 patients (17.4%) had a best response of CRi. 
With respect to the secondary endpoints, all patients who achieved BOR also achieved bone marrow 
MRD negative remission. At a median follow up of 7.5 months (27.9% events), the median DOR was 
not reached. The median EFS was also not reached (95% CI: 8.9, NE), with an estimated event-free 
probability at Month 6 of 72.7% (95% CI: 59.9, 82.0). Median OS was 19.1 months (95% CI 15.2, 
NE), at a median follow up of 10.5 months (25.3% events). At the updated December 2017 data cut, 
median OS was not reached.  
The response rates were generally consistent across various demographic and prognostic subsets, 
except for one (Asian n=6), for which the ORR was 50% (95% CI 11.8%, 88.2%).  
 
DLBCL indication 
In the final update (DCO: 08-Dec-2017) on 165 patients enrolled and 111 patients infused (FAS): 95 
received tisagenlecleucel manufactured at the Morris Plains facility (EAS Cohort) and 16 at the 
Fraunhofer Institute (Cohort A). Efficacy results showed an ORR of 51.6% (48/93) in infused patients 
in the EAS and 33.9% (56/165) in all enrolled patients. PFS and OS were also numerically higher in all 
infused patients (FAS). Median OS from enrolment date was 12.9 months (95% CI: 8.4, NE) in the 
infused population and 8.2 months (95% CI: 5.8, 11.7) in the enrolled population. The median OS 
from infusions was 11.7 months. 
The response rate in the primary analysis of SCHOLAR-1 was 26% (95% CI: 21%, 31%), with a CR 
rate of 7% and a PR rate of 18%. When SCHOLAR-1 was compared to enrolled patients in study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C2201, the difference in CR remained significant (19.2%, p<0.01), whereas the median OS was 
reduced from 11.7 months vs 6.3 months (p<0.05) to 8.4 months vs. 6.3 months (p=0.12). In the 
C2201 vs CORAL comparison, the difference in ORR and CR was ~12%, (p<0.05), favouring 
tisagenlecleucel. When the analyses was based on enrolled patients, response rates were similar 
across the two trials (ORR: -5%, p=0.32, CR: -1.7%, p=0.71). Median OS from last relapse was 
significantly better in C2201 compared to CORAL both in the infused set (median 16.3 months, 95% 
CI: 11.5, NR) and in the enrolled set (median 10.6 months, 95% CI: 8.3, 16.3) vs. median of 5.8 
months (95% CI: 4.7, 7.2) in CORAL (p<0.01). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
ALL indication 
The uncertainties that were identified during the assessment regarding the initially proposed indication 
for ALL were satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). The choice of a cut-off of 3-
25 years in the initially proposed indication was a reflection of the inclusion criteria of the pivotal study 
B2202. Efficacy and safety can be extrapolated to below the age of 3 as discussed in the efficacy 
section. Some uncertainty about the precise estimates will be made on the basis of a registry (see 
Annex II and RMP). 
 
DLBCL indication 
Longer than anticipated manufacturing times posed challenges for the treatment of patients in need 
resulting in a significant amount of patients withdrawing from the study (50 out of 165 enrolled 
patients did not receive the infusion). Thus, the efficacy as reported for the enrolled analysis set could 
be underestimated in case of improvements in the manufacturing time.  
In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Kymriah in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, the 
applicant should conduct and submit a prospective, observational study in patients with r/r DLBCL 
based on data from registry with efficacy outcome measures in line with study C2201, including details 
of the manufacturing turnaround time, (i.e. time from last relapse or confirmed refractory status, time 
from decision to treat, and time from leukapheresis to infusion) (see Annex II and RMP). 
In order to further characterise long-term efficacy and safety of Kymriah in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, 
the applicant should submit the 24 months follow-up for patients in the EAS Cohort and 24 months 
follow-up of all infused patients from study C2201. In addition the applicant should submit the final 
CSR including 5 years of follow-up (see Annex II and RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were reported in 88% of patients. The most common Grade 3 and 4 
non haematological adverse reaction was cytokine release syndrome (47%). The most common Grade 
3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were white blood cells decreased (99%), neutrophils 
decreased (95%), lymphocytes decreased (95%), platelets decreased (77%) and haemoglobin 
decreased (53%). 
A total of 84 patients (80.8%) reported AEs related to CRS in ALL studies B220 and B2205J over half 
of which (46 patients) had grade 3 or 4 severity. In all the 84 patients the AEs were suspected to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related to tisagenlecleucel treatment. In study C2201, 57 patients (57.6%) had CRS, all of which were 
suspected to be related to treatment with tisagenlecleucel.  
Febrile neutropenia were seen in 36% of ALL patients and in 13% of DLBCL patients and may be 
associated with LD therapy, and may be concurrent with CRS. Febrile neutropenia was mostly seen 
first eight weeks post-tisagenlecleucel and is managed appropriately with broad spectrum antibiotics, 
fluids and other supportive care. 
Infections were seen in 67% of ALL patients and in 53% of DLBCL patients and are related to B-cell 
depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia and may be associated to chemotherapy/lymphodepletion 
therapy as well as tisagenlecleucel. Infections were primarily bacterial or viral and were frequent both 
first eight weeks post-tisagenlecleucel as more than eight weeks post-infusion. Infections are managed 
by appropriate antibiotic and immunoglobulins in case of agammaglobulinemia. 
Tumour lysis syndrome was seen in 4% of ALL patients and 1% of DLBCL patients. Symptoms of TLS 
and events are managed according to local guidelines. 
The availability of tocilizumab at all hospitals and associated centres must be ensured by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder until an authorised treatment for CRS is available in the EU. Kymriah will only be 
supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the healthcare professionals 
involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational program. To mitigate the safety 
risks associated with the treatment of Kymriah, it must be ensured that hospitals and their associated 
centres that dispense Kymriah are specially qualified (see Annex II and RMP). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Due to the small safety database and short follow-up, further data on safety including long-term safety 
are needed. Patients will be followed up to 60 months in the clinical trials that are ongoing and regular 
reporting on safety data from the studies should be included in PSURs post-marketing. A disease 
registry in ALL and DLBCL patients will address this concern. The objective of this registry is to further 
characterise the safety including long-term safety of Kymriah, in the post marketing setting (Annex II 
and RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
• 
ALL indication 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal Study B2202 was met. A clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant ORR of 82.0% within 3 months post - Kymriah infusion was observed with the majority of 
patients experiencing deep responses as measured by MRD-negativity. This response rate considerably 
exceeds the response rates observed with clofarabine, blinatumomab or a combination therapy of 
clofarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in a similar patient population. Furthermore, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 184 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed ORR is supported by time dependent endpoints with a median OS of 19.1 months with a 
median follow up of 22.1 months.  
 
DLBCL 
In the DLBCL study C2201 based on the ITT analysis set that is considered the most relevant and 
conservative to estimate the effect of the treatment strategy, the complete response rate observed is 
in the range of what has been observed with other treatment modalities (CORAL studies). However, 
the duration of response is considered remarkable with more than 60% of responders still responding 
after a median follow-up of 19 months. Further strength of evidence is anticipated to be provided with 
agreed conditions.  
For both indications serious and life-threatening AEs, in particular CRS, have been observed in most 
patients, in particular first eight weeks post- Kymriah infusion. These AEs are considered manageable 
with the appropriate risk minimisation measures in place. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
• 
ALL indication 
Given the poor prognosis of patients with ALL, the treatment effect of Kymriah is considered clinically 
relevant, and has been demonstrated in the population in the single pivotal study that was submitted. 
The safety profile of Kymriah is acceptable in view of the therapeutic context, the observed benefits 
and the fact that any remaining uncertainties have been addressed. 
The overall B/R of Kymriah for the ALL indication is positive. 
 
DLBCL indication 
Whereas the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in terms of ORR/CR was modest based on the most 
conservative analyses, the duration of response in complete responders is substantial and therefore 
clinically relevant in the patient population.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kymriah for the treatment of paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of 
age with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in 
second or later relapse and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy is positive. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the benefit-risk balance as described above. 
The divergent position statement is appended to this report.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kymriah is not similar to Xaluprine, Blincyto, Iclusig and 
Besponsa within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Kymriah is favourable in the following indication: 
 
 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443047/2018  
Page 186 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Key elements: 
Availability of tocilizumab and site qualification 
To minimise the risks associated with the treatment of KYMRIAH, the MAH must ensure that hospitals 
and their associated centres that dispense KYMRIAH are specially qualified in accordance with the 
agreed control distribution program.  
The MAH must ensure on-site, immediate access to 4 doses of tocilizumab for each patient as CRS 
management medication prior to treating patients. 
KYMRIAH will only be supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the 
healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational 
program. 
The availability of tocilizumab at all hospitals and associated centres must be ensured by the MAH until 
an authorised treatment for CRS is available in the EU. 
Educational program – Prior to the launch of KYMRIAH in each Member State the MAH must agree 
about the content and format of the educational materials with the National Competent Authority.  
HCP Educational program  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where KYMRIAH is marketed, all HCPs who are 
expected to prescribe, dispense, and administer KYMRIAH shall be provided with a guidance document 
to: 
-         facilitate identification of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-         facilitate management of the CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-         ensure adequate monitoring of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-         facilitate provision of all relevant information to patients 
-         ensure that adverse reactions are adequately and appropriately reported 
-         ensure that detailed instructions about the thawing procedure are provided 
-         before treating a patient ensure that 4 doses of tocilizumab for each patient are available on 
site 
Patient Educational program  
To inform and explain to patients 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the risks of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions, associated with KYMRIAH 
the need to report the symptoms to their treating doctor immediately 
the need to remain in the proximity of the location where KYMRIAH was received for at 
least 4 weeks following KYMRIAH infusion 
the need to carry the patient alert card at all times  
  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 22 JUNE 2018 
Kymriah EMEA/H/C/4090 
The below mentioned members of the CAT did not agree with the CAT’s positive opinion 
recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation for Kymriah indicated for the treatment 
of: 
  Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
All below mentioned members agree that for the ALL indication a positive benefit/risk has been 
established, and this indication is considered approvable. However, efficacy in the diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) indication has not been sufficiently established. The MAA for the latter indication is 
based on one single pivotal, single arm trial in patients with r/r DLBCL. As explained in the CHMP 
points to consider on application with one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), in the case of licensing 
based on one single pivotal trial, the results should be exceptionally compelling. 
For the DLBCL indication, multiple factors complicate the contextualization of the data. These include 
the 1) uncertainties regarding the selection bias introduced by the high drop out of (poor prognosis) 
patients, 2) inability to adequately adjust for baseline characteristics in the indirect comparisons, 3) 
inability to establish DOR or PFS benefit due to the lack of published data in the historical controls, 4) 
lack of benefit on response rates and overall survival across the historical data sets for the ITT 
(enrolled) population. 
Consequently, it is at present not possible to conclude on the efficacy of Kymriah (administered on top 
of bridging chemotherapy) compared to currently available therapies. 
The risks of treatment, both identified and theoretical ones are substantial. The early safety findings 
include neurological adverse reactions and severe and life threatening cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS). Long-term safety issues are unknown. 
Due to the high degree of uncertainty in the obtained efficacy results for the DLBCL indication, the 
potential benefit cannot be determined for this population. Thus, the benefit/risk cannot be established 
and is thus not positive. As a consequence of the above considerations, and the regulatory 
environment where both indications were submitted under the same application, the below mentioned 
delegates disagree with the granting of the marketing authorisation including both indications on the 
ground that the potential benefit is considered not to be sufficiently demonstrated for the DLBCL 
indication.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 JUNE 2018 
Kymriah EMEA/H/C/4090 
The below mentioned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion 
recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation for Kymriah indicated for the treatment 
of: 
  Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
All below mentioned members agree that for the ALL indication a positive benefit/risk has been 
established, and this indication is considered approvable. However, efficacy in the diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) indication has not been sufficiently established. The MAA for the latter indication is 
based on one single pivotal, single arm trial in patients with r/r DLBCL. 
For the DLBCL indication, the results in the ITT population are not compelling; moreover the follow-up 
time is relatively short. Further, benefit is not established through the comparison of overall survival 
across the historical data sets for the ITT (enrolled) population. 
Consequently, it is at present not possible to conclude on the efficacy of Kymriah (administered on top 
of bridging chemotherapy) compared to currently available therapies. 
The risks of treatment, both identified and theoretical ones are substantial. The early safety findings 
include neurological adverse reactions and severe and life threatening cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS).  
Due to the high degree of uncertainty in the obtained efficacy results for the DLBCL indication, the 
potential benefit cannot be determined for this population. Thus, the benefit/risk cannot be established 
as positive. As a consequence of the above considerations, and the fact that both indications were 
submitted under the same application, the below mentioned delegates disagree with the granting of 
the marketing authorisation including both indications on the ground that the potential benefit is 
considered not to be sufficiently demonstrated for the DLBCL indication.

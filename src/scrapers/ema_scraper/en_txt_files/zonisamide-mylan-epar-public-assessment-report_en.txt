2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a marketing authorisation of a generic medicinal product of the centrally authorised 
product Zonegran. Zonegran was first authorised for use in the European Union on 10 March 2005.  
The active substance is zonisamide, a benzisoxazole derivative. Zonisamide is an antiepileptic compound, 
chemically unrelated to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The exact mechanism of action is not known, but 
zonisamide has been shown to block voltage sensitive sodium and calcium channels, which is thought to 
disrupt synchronised neuronal firing, thereby reducing the spread of seizure discharges and disrupting 
subsequent epileptic activity. Some studies also showed a modulatory effect on Gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)-mediated neuronal inhibition as well as a variety of other effects, which may contribute to the 
pharmacological effects. Furthermore, zonisamide exerts weak carbonic anhydrase activity in-vitro. 
Zonegran is indicated as: 
•  monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults 
with newly diagnosed epilepsy (see section 5.1); 
• 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and above. 
At the time of this report, Zonegran was available as hard capsules (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg) and 
orodispersible tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 300 mg).  
At treatment initiation of Zonegran in adults it is recommended to titrate the dose of zonisamide on the basis 
of the clinical effect. In newly diagnosed patients (monotherapy), treatment is started with 100 mg once a 
day, which is increased by 100 mg/day every 2 weeks. The usual maintenance dose is 300 mg/day. For add-
on treatment, zonisamide is recommended to be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, which is increased to 
100 mg/day after 1 week and thereafter at increments of 100 mg/day until the usual maintenance dose of 
300-500 mg/day. In children, dosing recommendations are based on body weight. 
Zonegran may be taken with or without food. 
The application for Zonisamide Mylan concerns 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules in the full range of 
indications approved for the reference product Zonegran. The application is supported by one bioequivalence 
(BE)  study  under  fasting  conditions  with  the  100  mg  capsule  strength.  A  biowaiver  has  been  requested  for 
the remaining strengths. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zonisamide Mylan is presented as hard capsules containing 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of zonisamide as active 
substance.

Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium laurilsulfate, hydrogenated vegetable oil. The 
capsule shells contain: titanium dioxide (E171) and gelatin; the printing ink consists of: shellac black iron 
oxide (E172) and potassium hydroxide, as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The finished product is available in a PVC/PVDC–Aluminium blister, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance zonisamide is 1,2-Benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, 
corresponding to the molecular formula  C8H8N2O3S and has a molecular mass 212.23 g/mol. The active 
substance has the following structure: 
Figure 1: Zonisamide structure. 
The  structure  of  the  active  substance  (AS)  has  been  confirmed  by  means  of  Mass  Spectrometry,  Infrared 
Spectrophotometry  (IR),  and  1H-  and  13C-Nuclear  Magnetic  Resonance  Spectroscopy  (NMR),  all  of  which 
support the chemical structure.  
It appears as a white to almost white, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is moderately soluble in water 
and HCl 0.1 N, practically insoluble in sodium hydroxide 1M, freely soluble in acetone and soluble in ethanol 
and acetonitrile. Its pKa is 10.2 and its partition coefficient is 0.36. 
Zonisamide does not have any chiral centre and is therefore an optical inactive substance. Polymorphism of 
zonisamide has not been described in literature. A polymorphism study performed the manufacturer using X-
ray powder diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that the same crystalline 
form is obtained repeatedly under the conditions of the manufacturing process.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the ASMF procedure. 
The proposed manufacturing process for zonisamide active substance involves two steps using commercially 
available starting materials.  
Reprocessing of the active substance or intermediate, including the description of the operation that has to 
be done and has been described. Both steps  are considered critical and the critical process parameters were 
listed together with acceptable justification for each operational margin. The starting material and the 
intermediate are controlled by appropriate specifications. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were characterised and are well discussed 
with regards to their origin and fate.

The  active  substance  primary  packaging  material  is  of  food  grade  and  in  compliance  with  current  Ph.  Eur. 
requirements and Commission Regulation 1183/2012. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for: appearance (visual inspection), 
identity (IR), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), particle size (laser light diffraction).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the reference standards has 
been provided. 
Batch analysis results for three commercial scale batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer were 
presented. The results comply with the proposed specification indicating consistent and robust manufacture. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches packaged in the proposed container  simulating commercial 
packaging for storage and distribution, stored for up to 24 months at long term condition (30 °C / 65 % RH)  
and for  6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH) were presented. Stability studies were 
conducted according to the ICH guidelines. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  water,  related  substances  and  assay.  Water  test  was 
performed instead of loss on drying (as in the release specification) because this parameter was specified at 
the  beginning  of  the  stability  studies.  Also,  the  control  of  this  parameter  is  maintained  taking  into  account 
that  water  may  be  increased  along  the  stability  studies  but  not  the  residual  solvents  (i.e.  ethanol).  Particle 
size is not included in the tested stability parameters because it is not a parameter likely to change with time 
during storage and does not need to be controlled in stability studies. This has been accepted on the basis of 
the  physicochemical  properties  of  the  zonisamide,  batch  data  and  considering  that no  mechanical  energy  is 
provided to the substance during storage. 
The analytical procedures used in stability studies are the same as described for release which were shown to 
be  stability  indicating.  Karl-Fischer  method  was  used  for  water  test.  After  24  months  under  long-term 
conditions or 6 months under accelerated conditions the three batches are within specification showing little 
or no change over time; the study is on-going.  
A stress study on a pilot scale batch was performed under the following conditions: light, high temperature 
and humidity combined, in solution in neutral, acid and basic medium and in oxidising conditions. Zonisamide 
was shown to be stable in the solid state under light stress and also at elevated temperatures along with high 
relative  humidity.  It  is  unstable  in  basic  and  oxidising  solutions  only  when  severe  heating  conditions  are 
employed. The new impurities generated under extreme conditions are not present in the impurity profile of 
zonisamide in normal stability conditions.   
A  photostability  study  according  to  the  ICH  guideline  on  photostability  testing  was  performed  on  the  same 
pilot  batch  of  the  active  substance.  The  study  confirmed  that  zonisamide  is  stable  against  UV/visible  light 
irradiation and therefore that no special storage conditions with respect to light protection are required.

Based on presented stability data, the proposed retest period is acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Zonisamide  Mylan  is  an  immediate  release  hard  gelatin  capsule. Zonisamide 25  mg  is  a  white  hard  capsule 
size No. 4 printed in black “Z 25”, 50 mg strength is a white hard capsule size No. 3 printed in red “Z 50” and 
the  100 mg  strength  is  a  white  hard  capsule  size  No.  1  printed  in  black  “Z  100”  to  allow  strength 
differentiation.  
The objective of pharmaceutical development was to develop a product generic to the reference product 
Zonegran 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules. The same pharmaceutical form has been developed as 
that of the reference product.  
The properties of the active substance and the choice of the excipients have been satisfactorily described. All 
the excipients used in this drug product are referred in the Ph. Eur. or NF. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been adequately proved.  Zonisamide 
capsules formulations used during development were presented.  
Taking into account the pharmaco-technical characteristics of the active substance the development of 
product was orientated to a  granulation process in order to obtain a final mixture with good homogeneity 
and manufacturability. All three strengths are manufactured from the same blend by proportionally filling the 
capsules. 
Comparative dissolution profiles between the test and reference product used in the bioequivalence study 
were performed in different media pH 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The 
results indicate that in all the tested media more than 85% of the drug is released within 15 min. No 
significant difference between the two products was observed for the comparative dissolution test.  
Also, the comparative dissolution profile has been performed in 0.1N HCl, pH 4.5 buffer and pH 6.8 buffer 
between Zonisamide Mylan different strengths (i.e. 25mg and 50mg) and 100 mg bio-batch. The dissolution 
profiles show similar profiles with more than 85% of the drug dissolved within 15 minutes in all media. 
The influence of the particle size distribution of the Zonisamide drug substance on dissolution behaviour of 
the final capsules has been investigated and a suitable specification for particle size has been set. 
The proposed QC (quality control) dissolution method has been adequately justified concerning the selection 
of the dissolution medium, apparatus and agitation speed. The discriminatory power of the proposed 
dissolution test with regard to relevant manufacturing variables and quality attributes of the active substance 
has been demonstrated. 
According to a risk assessment performed to identify the high risk steps of granulation that may affect the 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the final finished product, the critical process parameters that should be 
controlled were identified . 
The initial risk assessment and justifications was provided. Previous experience was used to determine the 
degree of risk associated with the granulation step and its potential to impact CQAs of the finished drug 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 9/22 
 
  
  
 
product. Once the CQAs were identified, the optimization of the process was focused on studying and 
establishing the most appropriate process parameters.  
The product is packaged n blister PVC/PVDC-Aluminium. The suitability of the selected material as container 
closure system was confirmed by the stability studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The main steps of the manufacturing process are: blending, granulation, milling, drying, final blending and 
encapsulation. The final blend is encapsulated proportionally at different weight for each dose and the 
capsules are packed.  
The  process  is  a  conventional  wet  granulation  process  and  subsequent  encapsulation.  .Critical  steps  were 
identified.  All  provided  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  established  for  the  manufacturing  process  are  acceptable 
and  justified  and  are  considered  suitable  to  guarantee  the  intended  quality  of  the  drug  product.  Details 
regarding the holding time at various process stages during manufacturing have been established.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner.  Satisfactory validation protocol has been submitted covering all three strengths. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for this kind of 
dosage form including appearance (organoleptic),  uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, UHPLC), dissolution (UHPLC, Ph. Eur.), assay (UHPLC), related substances 
(UHPLC), water  (Ph. Eur.), and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications were set in line with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. general monographs, the ICH 
guidelines and available batch data. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards of active substance and impurities has been presented.  
Batch analysis data were provided on three batches for each strength manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site at a scale smaller than the commercial batch size).  Results were in line with proposed 
specifications and confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches per strength stored under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 18 months and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for 6 months 
were provided. The stability studies were carried out in accordance with the ICH guidelines on stability. All 
the batches were packed in the container closure system proposed for marketing. Samples have been tested 
for checking the appearance, disintegration, water, dissolution, assay, related substances and microbial 
contamination (except in photostability studies). The methods used were shown to be stability indicating and 
were the same as for release with the exception of disintegration (not included in the release specification) 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 10/22 
 
  
  
which was done according to the European Pharmacopoeia. No significant changes were observed and the 
results were found to be well within the specification.  
A photostability study was performed on one batch of Zonisamide Mylan 25 mg and 100 mg capsules 
according ICH Q1 B. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the Zonisamide Mylan is 
photostable. 
The forced degradation study (neutral medium, acidic medium, basic medium, oxidative medium, light stress 
(simulated sun light, temperature and humidity and temperature) has shown that Zonisamide Mylan capsules 
are stable under neutral medium, acid medium, light stress and high temperature and humidity and that the 
product is less stable under basic medium, oxidative medium and high temperature (150 ºC). 
Base on the overall results, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months without any special storage conditions is 
acceptable as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Hard gelatin capsules are the only excipients from animal origin and corresponding Certificates of Suitability 
(CEPs) of monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia for Gelatin have been presented. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided by the 
applicant. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 11/22 
 
  
  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Zonisamide Mylan is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes 
for all zonisamide containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
any risk for the environment is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP was of the view that the non-clinical overview provided in support of this application was based on 
up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a generic product consisting of hard capsules containing 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg 
zonisamide. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence 
study with the 100 mg strength based on a cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was the 
pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant also provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as efficacy and safety of zonisamide based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The applicant confirmed that the clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
The applicant requested a biowaiver for the remaining hard capsule strengths (25 and 50 mg). According to 
the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) the following 
general requirements must be met where a waiver for additional strength(s) is claimed: 
a) the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process, 
b) the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same, 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 12/22 
 
  
  
c) the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amount of each 
excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths (for immediate release products 
coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and flavours are not required to follow this rule), 
d)  appropriate  in  vitro  dissolution  data  should  confirm  the  adequacy  of  waiving  additional  in  vivo 
bioequivalence testing. 
Although, for the reference product Zonegran, dose proportionality was only demonstrated for the dose range 
from 100 to 800 mg following single dose administration, proportionality is also expected at doses lower than 
100  mg  due  to  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  metabolism  of  zonisamide.  Thus,  upon  fulfilment  of  the 
general  biowaiver  criteria,  it  was  considered  sufficient  to  establish  bioequivalence  with  the  highest  strength 
applied for, i.e. 100 mg. 
All  hard  capsule  strengths  for  Zonisamide  Mylan  are  produced  by  the  same  manufacturing  process.  The 
qualitative  composition  of Zonisamid  Mylan  hard  capsules  is the  same  for  all  strengths  and  the  quantitative 
composition is proportional. Thus, conditions, a, b, and c were considered fulfilled.  
The  applicant  furthermore  conducted  comparative  dissolution  tests  comparing  the  dissolution  profile  of 
Zonisamide Mylan 100 mg hard capsules with the profile for Zonisamide Mylan 25 and 50 mg hard capsules 
at three pH values (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) and the following conditions:

As  more  than  85%  of  the  drug  product  was  dissolved  within  15  minutes  under  all  conditions  studied,  the 
applicant concluded that the profiles were similar without any further mathematical evaluation. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  tests  were  generally  conducted  in  line  with  the  bioequivalence  guideline 
recommendations  except  for  the  paddle  speed  which  was  selected  at  75  rpm  rather  than  50  rpm  as 
recommended  by  the  guideline.  The  applicant  justified  the  choice  of  the  paddle  speed  as  the  experimental 
conditions were selected in line with the compendial standard conditions set in the European Pharmacopoeia  
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 13/22 
 
  
  
 
 
 
and since a paddle speed of 50 rpm would not allow an even distribution of particles throughout the vessel, 
thus producing a high variability in the results. 
Upon  request  by  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  provided  additional  dissolution  profiles  generated  with  a  paddle 
speed  of  50  rpm.  Similarity  of  dissolution  profiles  for  results  obtained  at  50  rpm  was  determined  by 
calculating the similarity factor (f2). For all conditions studied, the similarity factor lay either between 50 to 
100,  or,  the  dissolved  quantities  of  active  substance  at  15  minutes  were  above  85%  for  both  doses.  Thus, 
similarity of the dissolution profiles between the different applied strengths was shown.   
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study, study 1631. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study 1631: A Single-Dose, Randomized, Open-Label, Crossover, Pivotal, Comparative Bioavailability Study 
of  Zonisamide  100  mg  Hard  Capsules  and  Zonegran  100  mg  Hard  Capsules  in  Healthy  Male  and  Female 
Volunteers under Fasting Conditions. 
Methods 
Study design  
This  was  a  pivotal,  single-dose,  randomized,  open-label,  two-period,  two-sequence,  two-treatment,  single-
centre, crossover study designed to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of zonisamide from Zonisamide 
100  mg  capsules  (J.  Uriach  y  Compañía  S.A.)  and  Zonegran  100  mg  capsules  (Eisai  Manufacturing  Ltd.) 
administered to healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions.  
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two dosing sequences.  
Prior  to  study  commencement,  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  two  treatment  sequences. 
Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 10 hours prior to drug administration until after the 
24.0-hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. Subjects took their assigned formulation after at least a 10-
hour fast, with 240 mL of ambient temperature water at their scheduled time point. 
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: Pre-dose (2 samples) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 
4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours in each study period. After centrifugation, the serum was 
aspirated and aliquoted. The samples were stored at -20°C (±5°C) in a freezer. 
The 2 treatment phases were separated by a washout period of 28 days.

Population(s) studied 
Healthy, non-smoking (for at least 6 months prior to first drug administration), male and female volunteers, 
18  years  of  age  or  older,  with  a  body  mass  index  (BMI)  within  18.5-30.0  kg/m²,  inclusive  and  a  minimum 
body weight of greater than 40 kg were recruited. 
Thirty-two (32) subjects aged between 26 and 77 years BMI in the range 19.5 – 29.6 kg/m² were included in 
the study. 
A  sample  size  of  32  subjects  (which  included  a  moderate  buffer  of  4  subjects  for  withdrawals  and/or 
dismissals) was estimated to attain at least 80% statistical power to demonstrate bioequivalence between the 
Test and Reference products, assuming the mean Test to Reference difference was within 5%, based on an 
estimated  intrasubject  variability  of  approximately  25%.  Subjects  who  were  dosed  (and  were  withdrawn  or 
dismissed) were not to be replaced.

Figure 2 - Subjects disposition 
  * Due to the adverse events reported, one subject was not considered healthy. Samples from this subject were analysed 
by the bioanalytical laboratory but were not included in pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. 
One subject withdrew from the study due to personal reasons prior to the second period of the study. Due to 
the  adverse  events  (AEs)  reported  for  another  subject,  ,  the  fact  that  he  had  fever  38.1,  feeling  cold, 
shaking,  headache,  increased  heart  rate  and  feeling  nauseous,  this  subject  was  not  considered  healthy. 
Samples  from  this  subject  were  analysed  by  the  bioanalytical  laboratory  but  were  not  included  in 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. 
Analytical methods 
Plasma  samples  of  subjects  were  analysed  using  a  validated  LC/MS/MS  method  for  zonisamide  using 
zonisamide-d4  as  internal  standard.  The  bioanalytical  report  showed  that  the  lower  limit  of  quantification 
(LLOQ) of zonisamide was 9.98 ng/mL (accuracy of 95.22% and precision of 2.54%). 
Duration of storage of plasma samples at -20°C from first blood draw until the final quantification amounts to 
47 days. Long-term stability was demonstrated until 68 days. 
A  total  of  1258  study  samples  were  analysed.  Three  study  samples  were  re-assayed  due  to  pre-dose 
concentration (1) and processing errors (2). A total of 114 samples were used for “Incurred sample analysis”. 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 16/22 
 
  
  
 
In 100% of the samples the difference between the two values measured was less than 20% of the mean of 
chromatographic assay. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) variables 
The  following  PK  parameters  for  the  parent  compound  were  calculated  by  standard  non-compartmental 
methods: 
1) Cmax: maximum observed serum concentration 
2) Tmax: time of observed Cmax 
3)  AUC0-72:  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  from  time  zero  to  the  time  of  the  last  measureable 
concentration 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive  statistics  of  all  PK  parameters  (min,  max,  median,  mean,  standard  deviation  and  coefficient  of 
variability) were provided for zonisamide for the Test and Reference products. 
Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  including  sequence,  subjects  nested  within  sequence,  period  and  treatment 
were to be performed on the logarithmic ln-transformed data for AUC72 and Cmax and on the untransformed 
data for Tmax. Tmax was to be analyzed using an additional non-parametric test (Wilcoxon test). 
The  90%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  of  the  Test/Reference  ratios  of  geometric  means  for  AUC72  and  Cmax 
were to be calculated based on the least square means and estimate of the ANOVA. 
Results 
One  subject  presented  a  measurable  pre-dose  zonisamide  concentration  in  the  2nd  period.  This  value  was, 
however, <5% of Cmax and was included in the statistical analysis.

EMA/170957/2016 
Page 17/22 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 4 Statistical analysis for zonisamide (ln-transformed values) 
The  intra-subject  coefficient  of  variations  (CV)  for  AUC0-72  and  Cmax  can  be  regarded  as  low  (4.05%  and 
4.21% for zonisamide).  
Safety data 
There were 25 adverse events (AEs) involving 11 subjects in this study.  
No serious AEs were reported during the conduct of this study.  
There were 10 AEs associated with 5 subjects who received the Test Product. These included 4 cases of pain 
in the extremity, and 1 case each of headache, somnolence, catheter site swelling, nausea, vessel puncture 
site pain, and back pain. 
There  were  15  AEs  associated  with  8  subjects  who  received  the  Reference  Product,  including  3  cases  of 
headache,  2  cases  of  somnolence,  2  cases  of  contusion,  and  1  case  each  of  catheter  site  haematoma, 
catheter  site  swelling,  heart  rate  increased,  nausea,  tremor,  feeling  cold,  body  temperature  increased  and 
decreased appetite. 
No AEs associated with clinical laboratory tests were experienced by the subjects post-study. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Zonisamide Mylan 100 mg hard capsules are considered 
bioequivalent with Zonegran 100 mg hard capsules. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This is an application pursuant to Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. As such, no new efficacy 
or  safety  studies  have  been  performed  with  Zonisamide  Mylan.  However,  the  results  from  a  bioequivalence 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report

study  (study 1631)  comparing  the  bioavailability  of  Zonisamide  Mylan  100  mg  capsules  and  Zonegran  100 
mg capsules were provided.  
Study  1631  was  conducted  according  to  the  standard  randomised,  two-period,  two-sequence  single  dose 
crossover  design  as  recommended  in  the  bioequivalence  guideline.  The  SmPC  of  Zonegran  states  that 
zonisamide  capsules  may  be  taken  with  or  without  food.  Therefore,  the  bioequivalence  study  was  correctly 
conducted  under  fasted  condition.  The  wash-out  period  of  28  days  was  regarded  sufficient  in  view  of  mean 
elimination half-life of 60 hours. The sampling scheme was adequate to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters 
(main  distribution  of  zonisamide  is  between  2  and  5  hours).  Termination  of  the  sampling  scheme  at  72h  is 
also acceptable for a long half-life drug in an immediate release formulation. Furthermore, the choice of the 
study population was considered adequate. The exclusion of one subject who was not considered healthy did 
not affect the study outcome. 
The  within  study  validation  was  considered  adequate.  The  long-term  stability  period  of  68  days  at  -  20°C 
covered  the  sample  storage  period  of  47  days.  Re-assay  of  samples  was  minimal  and  well  justified.  The 
incurred samples reanalysis met the required criteria of 20% of the original concentration. 
Standard pharmacokinetic variables have been used in study 1631. Since zonisamide is a long half-life drug 
and  the  formulation  is  an  immediate  release  one,  use  of  truncated  AUC  at  72h  is  acceptable.  Statistic  is 
described adequately. Standard methods for the statistical analysis were utilized, which was acceptable. 
The  results  of  the  study  showed  that  the  Test/Reference  ratio  of  geometric  means  and  the  corresponding 
90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ln-transformed  AUC0-72  and  Cmax  parameters  were  entirely  contained 
within  the  acceptance  interval  of  80.00%  to  125.00%.  Therefore,  it  could  be  concluded  that  BE  was 
demonstrated between Zonisamide Mylan 100 mg capsules and Zonegran 100 mg capsules. Furthermore, as 
all criteria for a biowaiver for the remaining strengths (25 and 50 mg) were met, the CHMP considered that in 
vivo BE studies for the other strengths could be waived.  
The safety data from study 1631 did not raise new safety concerns. No serious AEs were reported. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the available data, the CHMP concluded that Zonisamide Mylan 100 mg capsules are bioequivalent 
to Zonegran 100 mg capsules. As all criteria for a biowaiver were met, the CHMP agreed that no additional 
in vivo bioequivalence study with the remaining capsule strengths (25 and 50 mg) was needed. Zonisamide 
Mylan  25  mg,  50  mg  and  100  mg  hard  capsules  were  thus  considered  essentially  similar  to  the  reference 
product Zonegran. 
Taken together, the CHMP concluded that the available clinical data were adequate to support the application 
for Zonisamide Mylan 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules as a generic medicinal product to Zonegran.

the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Zonegran for content and to Duloxetine Mylan 30 mg hard gastro-
resistant capsules for design and layout. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of zonisamide hard capsules (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg). The 
reference product Zonegran is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without 
secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy as well as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults, adolescents, and children 
aged 6 years and above. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate 
summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A bioequivalence study with the 100 mg capsule strength forms the pivotal basis with a randomised, two-
period, two-sequence single dose crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate 
the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of 
dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical 
method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.  
The test formulation of Zonisamide Mylan 100 mg hard capsules met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the reference product Zonegran 100 mg hard capsules. The point 
estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-72 and Cmax were all contained 
Zonisamide Mylan Assessment report  
EMA/170957/2016 
Page 21/22 
 
  
  
within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations 
was demonstrated. Furthermore, a biowaiver was granted for the remaining capsule strengths, 25 and 
50 mg, thus waiving the requirement for additional in vivo bioequivalence studies with these strengths. 
A benefit/risk ratio for Zonisamide Mylan 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules comparable to the 
reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Zonisamide Mylan as monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without 
secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy as well as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults, adolescents, and children 
aged 6 years and above is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation

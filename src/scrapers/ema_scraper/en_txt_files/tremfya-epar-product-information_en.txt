CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Plaque psoriasis
Tremfya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy.
Psoriatic arthritis
Tremfya, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to 
a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which it is indicated.
Posology
Plaque psoriasis
The recommended dose is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a 
maintenance dose every 8 weeks (q8w).
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response 
after 16 weeks of treatment.
2
Psoriatic arthritis
The recommended dose is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a 
maintenance dose every 8 weeks. For patients at high risk for joint damage according to clinical 
judgement, a dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) may be considered (see section 5.1).
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response 
after 24 weeks of treatment.
Special populations
Elderly (≥ 65 years)
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
There is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years and very limited information in subjects aged 
≥ 75 years (see section 5.2).
Renal or hepatic impairment
Tremfya has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.
For further information on elimination of guselkumab, see section 5.2.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Tremfya in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not
been established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Subcutaneous use. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection 
sites.
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may inject Tremfya if a physician 
determines that this is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate medical 
follow-up of patients. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of solution according to 
the ‘Instructions for use’ provided in the carton.
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Serious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Infections
Guselkumab may increase the risk of infection. Treatment should not be initiated in patients with any 
clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.
Patients treated with guselkumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of 
clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or 
serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, the patient should be monitored closely and 
treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves.
3
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis
Prior to initiating treatment, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients 
receiving guselkumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after 
treatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients with a past 
history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in the post-marketing 
setting (see section 4.8). Some serious hypersensitivity reactions occurred several days after treatment 
with guselkumab, including cases with urticaria and dyspnoea. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction 
occurs, administration of guselkumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy 
initiated.
Hepatic transaminase elevations
In psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations was observed in 
patients treated with guselkumab q4w compared to patients treated with guselkumab q8w or placebo 
(see section 4.8).
When prescribing guselkumab q4w in psoriatic arthritis, it is recommended to evaluate liver enzymes 
at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. If increases in alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] are observed and drug-induced liver 
injury is suspected, treatment should be temporarily interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.
Immunisations
Prior to initiating therapy, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered 
according to current immunisation guidelines. Live vaccines should not be used concurrently in 
patients treated with guselkumab. No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines.
Before live viral or live bacterial vaccination, treatment should be withheld for at least 12 weeks after 
the last dose and can be resumed at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Prescribers should consult the 
Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific vaccine for additional information and guidance on 
concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents post-vaccination.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interactions with CYP450 substrates
In a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures 
(Cmax and AUCinf) of midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and caffeine after a 
single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant, indicating that interactions between 
guselkumab and substrates of various CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 
CYP1A2) are unlikely. There is no need for dose adjustment when co-administering guselkumab and 
CYP450 substrates.
Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy
In psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of guselkumab in combination with immunosuppressants, 
including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated.

4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and 
for at least 12 weeks after treatment.
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of guselkumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the 
use of Tremfya during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether guselkumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first few days after birth, and decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards; 
consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant during this period cannot be excluded. A decision should
be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Tremfya therapy, taking into account 
the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. See section 5.3 for 
information on the excretion of guselkumab in animal (cynomolgus monkey) milk.
Fertility
The effect of guselkumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tremfya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most common adverse reaction was respiratory tract infections in approximately 14% of patients 
in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 1 provides a list of adverse reactions from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies as well 
as from post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions are classified by MedDRA System Organ 
Class and frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Transaminases increased 
Neutrophil count decreased
Transaminases increased
In two Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, through the placebo-controlled period, adverse 
events of increased transaminases (includes ALT increased, AST increased, hepatic enzyme increased, 
transaminases increased, liver function test abnormal, hypertransaminasaemia) were reported more 
frequently in the guselkumab-treated groups (8.6% in the q4w group and 8.3% in the q8w group) than 
in the placebo group (4.6%). Through 1 year, adverse events of increased transaminases (as above) 
were reported in 12.9% of patients in the q4w group and 11.7% of patients in the q8w group.
Based on laboratory assessments, most transaminase increases (ALT and AST) were ≤ 3 x upper limit 
of normal (ULN). Transaminase increases from > 3 to ≤ 5 x ULN and > 5 x ULN were low in 
frequency, occurring more often in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the guselkumab q8w 
group (Table 2). A similar pattern of frequency by severity and by treatment group was observed 
through the end of the 2-year Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical study.

In the psoriasis clinical studies, through 1 year, the frequency of transaminase increases (ALT and 
AST) for the guselkumab q8w dose was similar to that observed for the guselkumab q8w dose in the 
6
psoriatic arthritis clinical studies. Through 5 years, the incidence of transaminase elevation did not 
increase by year of guselkumab treatment. Most transaminase increases were ≤ 3 x ULN.
In most cases, the increase in transaminases was transient and did not lead to discontinuation of 
treatment.
Neutrophil count decreased
In two Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, through the placebo-controlled period, the adverse 
event of decreased neutrophil count was reported more frequently in the guselkumab-treated group 
(0.9%) than in the placebo group (0%). Through 1 year, the adverse event of decreased neutrophil 
count was reported in 0.9% of patients treated with guselkumab. In most cases, the decrease in blood 
neutrophil count was mild, transient, not associated with infection and did not lead to discontinuation 
of treatment.
Gastroenteritis
In two Phase III psoriasis clinical studies through the placebo-controlled period, gastroenteritis 
occurred more frequently in the guselkumab-treated group (1.1%) than in the placebo group (0.7%). 
Through Week 264, 5.8% of all guselkumab-treated patients reported gastroenteritis. Adverse 
reactions of gastroenteritis were non-serious and did not lead to discontinuation of guselkumab
through Week 264. Gastroenteritis rates observed in psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through the 
placebo-controlled period were similar to those observed in the psoriasis clinical studies.
Injection site reactions
In two Phase III psoriasis clinical studies through Week 48, 0.7% of guselkumab injections and 0.3% 
of placebo injections were associated with injection site reactions. Through Week 264, 0.4% of 
guselkumab injections were associated with injection site reactions. Injection site reactions were 
generally mild to moderate in severity; none were serious, and one led to discontinuation of 
guselkumab.
In two Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through Week 24, the number of subjects that 
reported 1 or more injection site reactions was low and slightly higher in the guselkumab groups than 
in the placebo group; 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w group, 4 (1.1%) subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the placebo group. One subject discontinued 
guselkumab due to an injection site reaction during the placebo-controlled period of the psoriatic 
arthritis clinical studies. Through 1 year, the proportion of subjects reporting 1 or more injection site 
reactions was 1.6% and 2.4% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups respectively. Overall, the rate of 
injections associated with injection site reactions observed in psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through 
the placebo-controlled period was similar to rates observed in the psoriasis clinical studies.
Immunogenicity
The immunogenicity of guselkumab was evaluated using a sensitive and drug-tolerant immunoassay.
In pooled Phase II and Phase III analyses in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, 5% (n=145)
of patients treated with guselkumab developed antidrug antibodies in up to 52 weeks of treatment. Of 
the patients who developed antidrug antibodies, approximately 8% (n=12) had antibodies that were 
classified as neutralizing, which equates to 0.4% of all patients treated with guselkumab. In pooled 
Phase III analyses in patients with psoriasis, approximately 15% of patients treated with guselkumab
developed antidrug antibodies in up to 264 weeks of treatment. Of the patients who developed 
antidrug antibodies, approximately 5% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing, which 
equates to 0.76% of all patients treated with guselkumab. Antidrug antibodies were not associated with 
lower efficacy or development of injection-site reactions.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
7
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Single intravenous doses of guselkumab up to 987 mg (10 mg/kg) have been administered in healthy 
volunteers and single subcutaneous doses of guselkumab up to 300 mg have been administered in 
patients with plaque psoriasis in clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of 
overdose, the patient must be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment must be administered immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC16.
Mechanism of action
Guselkumab is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds selectively to the interleukin 23 
(IL-23) protein with high specificity and affinity. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in inflammatory 
and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, guselkumab inhibits IL-23-
dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines.
Levels of IL-23 are elevated in the skin of patients with plaque psoriasis. In in vitro models, 
guselkumab was shown to inhibit the bioactivity of IL-23 by blocking its interaction with cell surface 
IL-23 receptor, disrupting IL-23-mediated signaling, activation and cytokine cascades. Guselkumab 
exerts clinical effects in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through blockade of the IL-23 cytokine 
pathway.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In a Phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in reduced expression of IL-23/Th17 pathway 
genes and psoriasis-associated gene expression profiles, as shown by analyses of mRNA obtained 
from lesional skin biopsies of patients with plaque psoriasis at Week 12 compared to baseline. In the 
same Phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in improvement of histological measures of 
psoriasis at Week 12, including reductions in epidermal thickness and T-cell density. In addition, 
reduced serum IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 levels compared to placebo were observed in guselkumab
treated patients in Phase II and Phase III plaque psoriasis studies. These results are consistent with the 
clinical benefit observed with guselkumab treatment in plaque psoriasis.
In psoriatic arthritis patients in Phase III studies, serum levels of acute phase proteins C-reactive 
protein, serum amyloid A, and IL-6, and Th17 effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were 
elevated at baseline. Guselkumab decreased the levels of these proteins within 4 weeks of initiation of 
treatment. Guselkumab further reduced the levels of these proteins by Week 24 compared to baseline 
and also to placebo. 
Clinical efficacy and safety
Plaque psoriasis
The efficacy and safety of guselkumab was assessed in three randomised, double-blind, active 
controlled Phase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who were 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.
8
VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2
Two studies (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab versus 
placebo and adalimumab in 1829 adult patients. Patients randomised to guselkumab (N=825) received 
100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and 
Week 20 (VOYAGE 2). Patients randomised to adalimumab (N=582) received 80 mg at Week 0 and 
40 mg at Week 1, followed by 40 mg every other week (q2w) through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and 
Week 23 (VOYAGE 2). In both studies, patients randomised to placebo (N=422) received guselkumab 
100 mg at Weeks 16, 20 and q8w thereafter. In VOYAGE 1, all patients, including those randomised 
to adalimumab at Week 0, started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 52. In VOYAGE 2, 
patients randomised to guselkumab at Week 0 who were Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 
responders at Week 28 were re-randomised to either continue treatment with guselkumab q8w 
(maintenance treatment) or receive placebo (withdrawal treatment). Withdrawal patients re-initiated 
guselkumab (dosed at time of retreatment, 4 weeks later and q8w thereafter) when they experienced at 
least a 50% loss of their Week 28 PASI improvement. Patients randomised to adalimumab at Week 0 
who were PASI 90 non-responders received guselkumab at Weeks 28, 32 and q8w thereafter. In 
VOYAGE 2, all patients started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 76.
Baseline disease characteristics were consistent for the study populations in VOYAGE 1 and 2 with a 
median body surface area (BSA) of 22% and 24%, a median baseline PASI score of 19 for both 
studies, a median baseline dermatology quality of life index (DLQI) score of 14 and 14.5, a baseline 
investigator global assessment (IGA) score of severe for 25% and 23% of patients, and a history of 
psoriatic arthritis for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively.
Of all patients included in VOYAGE 1 and 2, 32% and 29% were naïve to both conventional systemic 
and biologic therapy, 54% and 57% had received prior phototherapy, and 62% and 64% had received 
prior conventional systemic therapy, respectively. In both studies, 21% had received prior biologic 
therapy, including 11% who had received at least one anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agent, 
and approximately 10% who had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23 agent.
The efficacy of guselkumab was evaluated with respect to overall skin disease, regional disease (scalp, 
hand and foot and nails) and quality of life and patient reported outcomes. The co-primary endpoints 
in VOYAGE 1 and 2 were the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of cleared or 
minimal (IGA 0/1) and a PASI 90 response at Week 16 versus placebo (see Table 3).
Overall skin disease
Treatment with guselkumab resulted in significant improvements in the measures of disease activity 
compared to placebo and adalimumab at Week 16 and compared to adalimumab at Weeks 24 and 48. 
The key efficacy results for the primary and major secondary study endpoints are shown in Table 3
below.

Response over time
Guselkumab demonstrated rapid onset of efficacy, with a significantly higher percent improvement in 
PASI as compared with placebo as early as Week 2 (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients achieving a 
PASI 90 response was numerically higher for guselkumab than adalimumab starting at Week 8 with 
the difference reaching a maximum around Week 20 (VOYAGE 1 and 2) and maintained through 
Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) (see Figure 1).

In VOYAGE 1, for patients receiving continuous guselkumab treatment, the PASI 90 response rate 
was maintained from Week 52 through Week 252. For patients randomised to adalimumab at Week 0
who crossed over to guselkumab at Week 52, the PASI 90 response rate increased from Week 52 
through Week 76 and was then maintained through Week 252 (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: Percent of subjects who achieved a PASI 90 response by visit in the open-label phase 
in VOYAGE 1
The efficacy and safety of guselkumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, body weight, 
plaques location, PASI baseline severity, concurrent psoriatic arthritis, and previous treatment with a 
biologic therapy. Guselkumab was efficacious in conventional systemic-naive, biologic-naive, and 
biologic-exposed patients.

In VOYAGE 2, 88.6% of patients receiving guselkumab maintenance treatment at Week 48 were 
PASI 90 responders compared to 36.8% of patients who were withdrawn from treatment at Week 28 
(p < 0.001). Loss of PASI 90 response was noted as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of guselkumab 
treatment with a median time to loss of PASI 90 response of approximately 15 weeks. Among patients 
who were withdrawn from treatment and subsequently re-initiated guselkumab, 80% regained a 
PASI 90 response when assessed 20 weeks after initiation of retreatment.
In VOYAGE 2, among 112 patients randomised to adalimumab who failed to achieve a PASI 90 
response at Week 28, 66% and 76% achieved a PASI 90 response after 20 and 44 weeks of treatment 
with guselkumab, respectively. In addition, among 95 patients randomised to guselkumab who failed 
to achieve a PASI 90 response at Week 28, 36% and 41% achieved a PASI 90 response with an 
additional 20 and 44 weeks of continued treatment with guselkumab, respectively. No new safety 
findings were observed in patients who switched from adalimumab to guselkumab.
Regional disease
In VOYAGE 1 and 2, significant improvements were seen in scalp, hand and foot, and nail psoriasis
(as measured by the Scalp-specific Investigator Global Assessment [ss-IGA], Physician’s Global 
Assessment of Hands and/or Feet [hf-PGA], Fingernail Physician’s Global Assessment [f-PGA] and 
Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI], respectively) in guselkumab treated patients compared to
placebo treated patients at Week 16 (p < 0.001, Table 4). Guselkumab demonstrated superiority 
compared to adalimumab for scalp and hand and foot psoriasis at Week 24 (VOYAGE 1 and 2) and
Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) (p ≤ 0.001, except for hand and foot psoriasis at Week 24 [VOYAGE 2] and 
Week 48 [VOYAGE 1], p < 0.05).

Health-related quality of life / Patient reported outcomes
Across VOYAGE 1 and 2 significantly greater improvements in health-related quality of life as 
measured by Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and in patient-reported psoriasis symptoms 
(itching, pain, burning, stinging and skin tightness) and signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, 
shedding or flaking, redness and bleeding) as measured by the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary
(PSSD) were observed in guselkumab patients compared to placebo patients at Week 16 (Table 5). 
Signs of improvement on patient-reported outcomes were maintained through Week 24 (VOYAGE 1 
12
and 2) and Week 48 (VOYAGE 1). In VOYAGE 1, for patients receiving continuous guselkumab 
treatment, these improvements were maintained in the open-label phase through Week 252 (Table 6).

In VOYAGE 2, guselkumab patients had significantly greater improvement from baseline compared 
to placebo in health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression, and work limitation measures at 
Week 16, as measured by the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) health survey questionnaire, Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), respectively. 
The improvements in SF-36, HADS and WLQ were all maintained through Week 48 and in the 
open-label phase through Week 252 among patients randomised to maintenance therapy at Week 28.
NAVIGATE
The NAVIGATE study examined the efficacy of guselkumab in patients who had an inadequate 
response (ie, who had not achieved a ‘cleared’ or ‘minimal’ response defined as IGA ≥ 2) to 
ustekinumab at Week 16. All patients (N=871) received open-label ustekinumab (45 mg ≤100 kg and 
13
90 mg >100 kg) at Weeks 0 and 4. At Week 16, 268 patients with an IGA ≥ 2 score were randomised
to either continue ustekinumab treatment (N=133) q12w, or to initiate guselkumab treatment (N=135) 
at Weeks 16, 20, and q8w thereafter. Baseline characteristics for randomised patients were similar to 
those observed in VOYAGE 1 and 2.
After randomisation, the primary endpoint was the number of post-randomisation visits between 
Weeks 12 and 24 at which patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 and had ≥ 2 grade improvement.
Patients were examined at four week intervals for a total of four visits. Among patients who
inadequately responded to ustekinumab at the time of randomisation, significantly greater
improvement of efficacy was observed in patients who switched to guselkumab treatment compared to 
patients who continued ustekinumab treatment. Between 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation,
guselkumab patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 with ≥ 2 grade improvement twice as often as 
ustekinumab patients (mean 1.5 vs 0.7 visits, respectively, p < 0.001). Additionally, at 12 weeks after 
randomisation a higher proportion of guselkumab patients compared to ustekinumab patients achieved 
an IGA score 0/1 and ≥ 2 grade improvement (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively; p = 0.001) and a 
PASI 90 response (48% vs 23%, respectively, p < 0.001). Differences in response rates between 
guselkumab and ustekinumab treated patients were noted as early as 4 weeks after randomisation 
(11.1% and 9.0%, respectively) and reached a maximum 24 weeks after randomisation (see Figure 3).
No new safety findings were observed in patients who switched from ustekinumab to guselkumab.

Efficacy and safety of guselkumab were also investigated in a double-blind study compared to
secukinumab. Patients were randomised to receive guselkumab (N=534; 100 mg at Week 0, 4 and q8w 
thereafter), or secukinumab (N=514; 300 mg at Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and q4w thereafter). The last dose 
was at week 44 for both treatment groups.
Baseline disease characteristics were consistent with a population of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis with a median BSA of 20%, a median PASI score of 18, and an IGA score of severe for 24% 
of patients.

Guselkumab was superior to secukinumab as measured by the primary endpoint of PASI 90 response 
at Week 48 (84.5% versus 70.0%, p < 0.001). Comparative PASI response rates are presented in 
Table 7.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
Guselkumab has been shown to improve signs and symptoms, physical function and health-related 
quality of life, and reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage in adult patients with 
active PsA.
DISCOVER 1 and DISCOVER 2
Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies (DISCOVER 1 and 
DISCOVER 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab versus placebo in adult patients with 
active PsA (≥ 3 swollen and ≥ 3 tender joints, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL in 
DISCOVER 1, and ≥ 5 swollen and ≥ 5 tender joints, and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL in 
15
DISCOVER 2), despite conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD, apremilast, or nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA based on 
the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR]) for a median duration of 4 years. Patients 
with different subtypes of PsA were enrolled in both studies, including polyarticular arthritis with the 
absence of rheumatoid nodules (40%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (30%), asymmetric 
peripheral arthritis (23%), distal interphalangeal involvement (7%) and arthritis mutilans (1%). Over 
65% and 42% of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively, and over 75% of 
patients had ≥ 3% BSA psoriasis skin involvement. DISCOVER 1 and DISCOVER 2 evaluated 381 
and 739 patients, respectively, who received treatment with guselkumab 100 mg administered at 
Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 8 weeks (q8w) or guselkumab 100 mg q4w, or placebo. At Week 
24, placebo subjects in both studies crossed over to receive guselkumab 100 mg q4w. Approximately 
58% of patients in both studies continued on stable doses of MTX (≤ 25 mg/week).
In both studies over 90% of patients had prior csDMARD use. In DISCOVER 1, 31% of patients had 
previously received anti-TNFα treatment. In DISCOVER 2, all patients were naive to biologic 
therapy.
Signs and symptoms
Treatment with guselkumab resulted in significant improvements in the measures of disease activity
compared to placebo at Week 24. The primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients 
who achieved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24. The key efficacy 
results are shown in Table 8.

Response over time
In DISCOVER 2, a greater ACR 20 response was observed in both guselkumab groups compared to 
placebo as early as Week 4 and the treatment difference continued to increase over time through 
Week 24 (Figure 5).
Figure 5:
ACR 20 response by visit through week 24 in DISCOVER 2
In DISCOVER 2, for subjects receiving continuous guselkumab treatment at week 24, ACR 20 
19
response was maintained from Week 24 to Week 52 (see Figure 6). For subjects receiving continuous 
guselkumab treatment at week 52, ACR 20 response was maintained from Week 52 to Week 100 (see 
Figure 7).

including MTX (DISCOVER 1 and 2). Additionally, examination of age, gender, race, body weight, 
and previous csDMARD use (DISCOVER 1 and 2) and previous anti-TNFα use (DISCOVER 1), did 
not identify differences in response to guselkumab among these subgroups.
In DISCOVER 1 and 2, improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores including 
patient assessment of pain. At Week 24 in both studies, the proportion of patients achieving a modified 
PsA response criteria (PsARC) response was greater in the guselkumab groups compared to placebo. 
PsARC responses were maintained from Week 24 to Week 52 in DISCOVER 1 and Week 100 in 
DISCOVER 2.
Dactylitis and enthesitis were assessed based on pooled data from DISCOVER 1 and 2. At Week 24, 
among patients with dactylitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with dactylitis resolution was 
greater in the guselkumab q8w group (59.4%, nominal p < 0.001) and q4w group (63.5%, p = 0.006) 
compared to placebo (42.2%). At Week 24, among patients with enthesitis at baseline, the proportion 
of subjects with enthesitis resolution was greater in the guselkumab q8w group (49.6%, nominal 
p < 0.001) and q4w group (44.9%, p = 0.006) compared to placebo (29.4%). At Week 52, the 
proportions of subjects with dactylitis resolution (81.2% in q8w group and 80.4% in q4w group) and 
enthesitis resolution (62.7% in q8w group and 60.9% in q4w group) were maintained. In DISCOVER 
2, among subjects with dactylitis and enthesitis at baseline, the proportion of patients with dactylitis 
resolution (91.1% in q8w group and 82.9% in q4w group) and enthesitis resolution (77.5% in q8w 
group and 67.7% in q4w group) were maintained at Week 100.
In DISCOVER 1 and 2, patients treated with guselkumab who had spondylitis with peripheral arthritis 
as their primary presentation, demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in Bath Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) compared to placebo at Week 24. Improvement in 
BASDAI was maintained from Week 24 to Week 52 in DISCOVER 1 and Week 100 in DISCOVER 
2.
Radiographic response
In DISCOVER 2, inhibition of structural damage progression was measured radiographically and 
expressed as the mean change from baseline in the total modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score. 
At Week 24, the guselkumab q4w group demonstrated statistically significantly less radiographic 
progression and the guselkumab q8w group showed numerically less progression than placebo 
(Table 11). The observed benefit with the guselkumab q4w dosing regimen on inhibition of 
radiographic progression (ie, smaller mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score in the 
q4w group versus placebo) was most pronounced in subjects with both a high C-reactive protein value 
and high number of joints with erosions at baseline.

Physical function and health-related quality of life
In DISCOVER 1 and 2, guselkumab treated patients showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) in 
physical function compared to placebo as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability 
Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24. Improvements in HAQ-DI were maintained from Week 24 to Week 52
in DISCOVER 1 and Week 100 in DISCOVER 2.
A significantly greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS)
score was observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo at Week 24 in DISCOVER 1 
(p < 0.001 for both dose groups) and DISCOVER 2 (p = 0.006 for q4w group). At Week 24, a greater 
increase from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score 
was observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo in both studies. In DISCOVER 2, 
greater improvements in health-related quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (DLQI) were observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo at Week 24.
Improvements in SF-36 PCS, FACIT-F and DLQI scores were maintained from Week 24 to Week 52
in DISCOVER 1 and Week 100 in DISCOVER 2.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
guselkumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic 
arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, guselkumab reached a mean 
(± SD) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 8.09 ± 3.68 mcg/mL by approximately 5.5 days post 
dose.
21
Steady-state serum guselkumab concentrations were achieved by Week 20 following subcutaneous 
administrations of 100 mg guselkumab at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. The mean 
(± SD) steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations in two Phase III studies in patients with 
plaque psoriasis were 1.15 ± 0.73 mcg/mL and 1.23 ± 0.84 mcg/mL.
The pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in subjects with psoriatic arthritis was similar to that in subjects 
with psoriasis. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of guselkumab at Weeks 0, 4, and 
every 8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was also 
approximately 1.2 mcg/mL. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of guselkumab every 
4 weeks, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 3.8 mcg/mL.
The absolute bioavailability of guselkumab following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection was 
estimated to be approximately 49% in healthy subjects.
Distribution
Mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous 
administration to healthy subjects ranged from approximately 7 to 10 L across studies.
Biotransformation
The exact pathway through which guselkumab is metabolised has not been characterised. As a human 
IgG mAb, guselkumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic
pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.
Elimination
Mean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to healthy subjects
ranged from 0.288 to 0.479 L/day across studies. Mean half-life (T1/2) of guselkumab was 
approximately 17 days in healthy subjects and approximately 15 to 18 days in patients with plaque 
psoriasis across studies.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids 
and csDMARDs such as methotrexate, did not affect the clearance of guselkumab.
Linearity/non-linearity
The systemic exposure of guselkumab (Cmax and AUC) increased in an approximately 
dose-proportional manner following a single subcutaneous injection at doses ranging from 10 mg to 
300 mg in healthy subjects or patients with plaque psoriasis.
Elderly patients
No specific studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Of the 1384 plaque psoriasis patients 
exposed to guselkumab in Phase III clinical studies and included in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, 70 patients were 65 years of age or older, including 4 patients who were 75 years of age or 
older. Of the 746 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to guselkumab in Phase III clinical studies, a total 
of 38 patients were 65 years of age or older, and no patients were 75 years of age or older.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients indicated no 
apparent changes in CL/F estimate in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to patients < 65 years of 
age, suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients.
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment
No specific study has been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of guselkumab. Renal elimination of intact guselkumab, an IgG mAb, is expected to
22
be low and of minor importance; similarly, hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance 
of guselkumab as IgG mAbs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and pre- and post-natal development.
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, guselkumab was well tolerated via
intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to 
monkeys resulted in exposure (AUC) and Cmax values that were at least 49-fold and >200-fold higher, 
respectively, than those measured in the human clinical PK study. Additionally, there were no adverse 
immunotoxicity or cardiovascular safety pharmacology effects noted during the conduct of the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies or in a targeted cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus 
monkeys.
There were no preneoplastic changes observed in histopathology evaluations of animals treated up to 
24-weeks, or following the 12-week recovery period during which active substance was detectable in 
the serum.
No mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with guselkumab.
Guselkumab could not be detected in breast milk from cynomolgus monkeys as measured at post-natal 
day 28.

1. What Tremfya is and what it is used for
Tremfya contains the active substance guselkumab which is a type of protein called a monoclonal 
antibody.
This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, which is present at increased 
levels in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
Plaque psoriasis
Tremfya is used to treat adults with moderate to severe “plaque psoriasis”, an inflammatory condition 
affecting the skin and nails.
Tremfya can improve the condition of the skin and appearance of nails and reduce symptoms, such as 
scaling, shedding, flaking, itching, pain and burning.
Psoriatic arthritis
Tremfya is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”, an inflammatory disease of the joints, 
often accompanied by plaque psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be 
given Tremfya to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Tremfya can be used alone or with 
another medicine named methotrexate.
Using Tremfya in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities.

Instructions for use
Tremfya
Pre-filled syringe
SINGLE-USE
DEVICE
Important
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Tremfya at home, 
you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Tremfya using the pre-filled syringe 
before attempting to inject.
Please read these Instructions for use before using the Tremfya pre-filled syringe and each time you 
get a refill. There may be new information. This instruction guide does not take the place of talking 
with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Please also read the Package Leaflet 
carefully before starting your injection and discuss any questions you may have with your doctor or 
nurse.
The Tremfya pre-filled syringe is intended for injection under the skin, not into the muscle or vein. 
After injection, the needle will retract into the body of the device and lock into place.
Storage information

30 minutes before use.
Do not warm any other way.
Check the expiry date (‘EXP’) on the back panel of the carton.
Do not use if the expiry date has passed.
Do not inject if the perforations on the carton are broken.
Call your doctor or pharmacist for a refill.
Choose injection site
Select from the following areas for your injection:

•
•
Front of thighs (recommended)
Lower abdomen
Do not use the 5-centimetre area around your belly-button.
Back of upper arms (if a caregiver is giving you the injection)
Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard.
Do not inject into areas with scars or stretch marks.
55
Clean injection site
Wash your hands well with soap and warm water.
Wipe your chosen injection site with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.
Do not touch, fan or blow on the injection site after you have cleaned it.
Inspect liquid
Take the pre-filled syringe out of the carton.
Check the liquid in the viewing window. It should be clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny 
white or clear particles. You may also see one or more air bubbles.
This is normal.
Do not inject if the liquid is cloudy or discoloured, or has large particles. If you are uncertain, call 
your doctor or pharmacist for a refill.
56
2. Inject Tremfya using the pre-filled syringe
Remove needle cover
Hold syringe by the body and pull needle cover straight off.

Do not use the Tremfya pre-filled syringe if it is dropped. Call your doctor or pharmacist for a refill.
Position fingers and insert needle
Place your thumb, index and middle fingers directly under the finger flange, as shown.
Do not touch plunger or area above finger flange as this may cause the needle safety device to 
activate.
Use your other hand to pinch skin at the injection site. Position syringe at about a 45 degree angle to 
the skin.
It is important to pinch enough skin to inject under the skin and not into the muscle.
Insert needle with a quick, dart-like motion.
57
Release pinch and reposition hand
Use your free hand to grasp the body of the syringe.
Press plunger
Place thumb from the opposite hand on the plunger and press the plunger all the way down until it 
stops.
Release pressure from plunger
The safety guard will cover the needle and lock into place, removing the needle from your skin.
58
3. After your injection
Throw the used pre-filled syringe away
Put your used syringe in a sharps disposal container right away after use.
Make sure you dispose of the bin as instructed by your doctor or nurse when the container is full.
Check injection site
There may be a small amount of blood or liquid at the injection site. Hold pressure over your skin with 
a cotton ball or gauze pad until any bleeding stops.
Do not rub the injection site.
If needed, cover injection site with a bandage.
Your injection is now complete!

you may have with your doctor or nurse.

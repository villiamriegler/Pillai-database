2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds:

the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing selumetinib was 
considered justified based on clinical data showing tumour response in neurofibromatosis type 1 
patients with plexiform neurofibromas; 
the condition is life-threatening due to reduced life expectancy and chronically debilitating due to 
cognitive deficits and learning disabilities, scoliosis, seizures, osseous dysplasia and increased risk 
of developing benign and malignant neoplasms; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant clinically heterogeneous neurocutaneous 
genetic disorder. It is caused by germline mutations in the NF1 tumour suppressor gene (17q11.2) and 
rarely by 17q11 microdeletion (only 5%), which encodes the tumour suppressor protein neurofibromin 
1. Several thousand distinct pathogenic NF1 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. 
Neurofibromin 1 is a guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP)ase activating protein that promotes the 
conversion of active Ras GTP to inactive Ras guanosine 5’diphosphate. NF1 therefore functions as a 
negative regulator of the Ras proto oncogene, which is a key signalling molecule in the control of cell 
growth. NF1 mutation that leads to loss of function results in a failure to inactivate RAS, and can result 
in various tumour types, such as malignant or benign tumours. Approximately half of NF1 cases are 
familial, with complete penetrance, and the remainder are the result of de novo mutations. 
NF1  is  characterized  by  diverse  and  progressive  cutaneous,  neurological,  skeletal,  and  neoplastic 
manifestations early in life and the associated morbidities can be severe. Neurofibromas are histologically 
benign  nerve  sheath  tumours,  which  can  be  broadly  grouped  into  dermal  neurofibroma  or  plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN). While the dermal neurofibromas originate from terminal nerve branches in the skin 
and rarely develop before puberty, PNs typically grow deeper in the body along large nerves and plexuses 
and are present at birth. PNs grow the fastest during the first decade of life, and can cause pain, motor 
impairment and obstruction.  
Clinical manifestations also include cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, headaches, and seizures, 
café-au-lait macules, axillary and/or inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and osseous dysplasias.

The approved therapeutic indication “Koselugo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of 
symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis 
type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years and above” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“Treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening. 
At the time of this review, treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 is presented to the COMP to remain 
chronically debilitating and life-threatening disease. The clinical course can be debilitating due to pain, 
neurological and motor dysfunction, airway compromise, visual impairment, and/or disfigurement. The 
skin manifestations can be a psychological burden. In addition, individuals with NF1 are prone to 
develop benign or malignant tumours, such as sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). 
Optic pathway gliomas may cause delayed puberty and a short stature by pressuring on the 
hypothalamic region.  NF1 is associated with an 8- to 15-year reduction in average life expectancy in 
both men and women, primarily due to malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular causes.  
The COMP concluded that the condition remains life-threatening due to reduced life expectancy and 
chronically debilitating due to cognitive deficits and learning disabilities, scoliosis, seizures, osseous 
dysplasia and increased risk of developing benign and malignant neoplasms. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be approximately 3 per 10,000. 
For this review the prevalence was proposed to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 3 per 10,000. Following a literature search, 7 relevant studies from 1980 to present 
were identified with epidemiology data from Finland, Germany, Sweden and the UK with prevalence 
estimates ranging from 1.76 to 3.34 per 10000 (table 1). Based on a review of the published literature 
and the 2018 ORPHANET report on rare diseases in Europe the estimated prevalence of NF1 in the 
European Community ranges between 2 to 3 per 10,000 inhabitants.  The estimated prevalence is not 
affected by the data from the UK.

The sponsor did not provide any further discussion regarding the calculation of the prevalence which 
was based on the published literature. To be conservative and account for the data provided, the COMP 
agreed on the prevalence to be 3 in 10,000.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are no pharmacological treatments authorised for the treatment of NF1 in general, or plexiform 
neurofibromas associated with NF1 specifically, in the EU.  
Symptomatic treatments are pain analgesics including opioids and antiepileptics.  
There are 2 national disease management guidelines for NF1 available in Europe: from the UK (Neuro 
Foundation (UK) Guidelines 2016) and France (French National Protocol for NF1 2016). There is 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

currently no single therapy available for the treatment of NF1 and a multi-disciplinary approach to the 
management of NF1-related conditions is the mainstay of current treatment. Surgical removal is the 
primary treatment for neurofibromas and surgically amenable plexiform neurofibromas. However, most 
PNs are not amenable to complete resection due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital 
structures. Permanent surgical complications (such as speech abnormalities, nerve palsies, and pain) 
following subtotal or partial PN resection have been reported in 18% of patients, with regrowth 
occurring in up to 55% of patients. Regrowth is most common in patients under age 10 years.   
Although these guidelines do suggest several off-label strategies for the treatment of some NF1-related 
malignancies, these are based on incomplete evidence (such as  carboplatin and vincristine, 
vinblastine, irinotecan, and bevacizumab for optic pathway glioma, ifosamide for MPNST (Malignant 
Peripheral Neve Sheath Tumour), or imatinib for GIST.  
Significant benefit 
Not applicable, since there are no satisfactory methods currently authorised in the EU for treatment of 
patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.  
4. COMP List of questions 
Not applicable. 
5. COMP position adopted on 26 April 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of neurofibromatosis type 1 (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening due to reduced life expectancy and chronically debilitating due to 
cognitive deficits and learning disabilities, scoliosis, seizures, osseous dysplasia, developments of 
dermal and plexiform neurofibroma and increased risk of malignant neoplasms; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Koselugo, selumetinib, for 
treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (EU/3/18/2050) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

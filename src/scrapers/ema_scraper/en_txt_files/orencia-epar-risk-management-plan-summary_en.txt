Summary of risk management plan for ORENCIA 
(abatacept) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ORENCIA. The RMP details important 
risks of ORENCIA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about ORENCIA's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ORENCIA's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ORENCIA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for ORENCIA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ORENCIA's 
RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for 
ORENCIA  is  authorised  for  rheumatoid  arthritis,  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  and 
psoriatic arthritis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains abatacept as the active substance 
and it is given by either intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of ORENCIA’s benefits can be found in ORENCIA’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of ORENCIA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ORENCIA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  ORENCIA,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of ORENCIA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  ORENCIA  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of ORENCIA. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risks 
Infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In RA clinical trials, there were small increases in the overall incidences 
of infection, serious infections, and dose interruptions due to infection in 
the abatacept treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group. 
Majority of the infections were non-serious. Most serious infections were 
likely to be bacterial in origin and responded to therapy. Mycobacterial, 
disseminated viral, or invasive fungal were rare. 
Age, extra-articular manifestations of RA, leukopenia, use of 
corticosteroids, and comorbidities has been identified as predictors of 
infection in RA subjects. Abatacept use with anti-TNFs may increase the 
risk of infections. Risk groups for TB include persons with prior or current 
exposure to others with TB, and persons living in poverty with limited 
access to medical care, adequate housing, and nutrition.

Infusion related reactions (IV Abatacept) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In  RA  clinical  trials,  there  were  small  increases  in  the  incidences  of 
infusional  events  and  dose  interruptions  due  to  acute  infusional  adverse 
events  in  the  abatacept  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
treatment  group.  Most  acute  infusional  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity.  The  most  frequently  reported  infusional  events  were  dizziness, 
nausea  and  flushing.  Serious  infusion  related  reactions  were  rare.  
Premedications were not used during clinical trials with abatacept. 
None. No specific risk factors for serious infusional events have been 
identified.

with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
See section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-authorization 
development plan. 
In RA clinical trials with abatacept SC administration, there were increases 
in the incidences of local injection site reactions in the abatacept treatment 
group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group.  Almost  all  the  local 
injection  site  reactions  were  mild  to  moderated  intensity  and  nonserious; 
serious  local  injection  site  reactions  were  very  rare  (<0.01%).  Systemic 
injection  reactions  were  reported  in  clinical  studies  and  postmarketing 
experience.  Most  of  the  systemic  injection  reactions  were  of  mild  or 
moderate  intensity.  Serious  systemic  injection  reactions  (i.e.,  serious 
hypersensitivity  or  anaphylaxis)  were  rare,  but  can  be  life-threatening  or 
fatal.    
Although risk factors for injection-site reactions have not been formally 
explored, several have been hypothesized, including poor self-injection 
technique, repeated use of the same site, medication type, dose and prior 
duration of therapy. No specific risk factors for systemic injection 
reactions have been identified.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
In  the  nonclinical  studies,  lymphoma  and  mammary  gland  tumors  were 
identified  in  a  mouse  carcinogenicity  study.  The  findings  appeared  to  be 
secondary  to  suppression  of  host  defense  with  reactivation  of  latent 
oncogenic  viruses  specific to  the  mouse. The  clinical  significance of this 
observation  is  unknown.  In  a  one-year  toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys, abatacept was not associated with any significant toxicity. In the 
RA clinical studies double-blind, controlled period, IR of malignancies in 
abatacept-treated subjects was comparable to placebo-treated subjects; the 
IR of malignant AEs during the cumulative period decreased relative to the 
IR  in  the  double-blind  placebo  controlled  period  in  abatacept  treatment 
group 
Risk factors for malignancy are dependent on malignancy type. No RA 
specific risk factors for overall malignancy have been identified.

Autoimmune symptoms and disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Assessment of the risk for autoimmune disorders is of importance due to 
the 
anti-CTLA4  antibodies  causing  autoimmune  phenomenon,  and 
observations  of  certain  autoimmune  disorders  associated  with  other 
biologic treatments, particularly the TNF-antagonist agents. Currently there 
is no evidence for an increased risk of medically significant autoimmunity 
in patients with abatacept treatment. 
Risk factors for autoimmune disorders include gender, ethnicity, genetic 
predisposition, family history, infections and some environmental factors.

Infections associated to immunization with live vaccines 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
There is no data of infections associated to live vaccine immunization 
identified from abatacept clinical studies and postmarketing experience. 
Data have suggested that other biological DMARDS that are used to treat 
RA or other diseases may affect the safety of live vaccines in newborns 
and infants exposed to these drugs in utero. 
All immunosuppressant therapies have the potential to cause infections 
associated to immunization with live vaccines. No other risk factors in the 
treated populations have been characterized.

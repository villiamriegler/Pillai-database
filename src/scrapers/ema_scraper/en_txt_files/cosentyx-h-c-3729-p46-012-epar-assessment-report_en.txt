period  1  (TP1)  and  treatment  period  3  (TP3),  and  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo 
controlled, event-driven withdrawal design in TP2. The study design is outlined in Figure 2.3.2.1.

Study population /Sample size 
It  was  planned  that  approximately  80  subjects  were  to  be  enrolled  in  TP1  (to  reach  the  minimum 
required sample size of 60 subjects in TP2) and that every effort was to be made in order to randomize 
at least 20 subjects from each JIA category to TP2. A total of 97 subjects were screened, of which 86 
subjects (88.7%) completed and 11 subjects (11.3%) discontinued the screening phase. A total of 86 
subjects from 32 sites entered into TP1 and 75 subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio to secukinumab 
(37 subjects) or placebo (38 subjects) in TP2. 
Treatments 
Secukinumab for SC injection was supplied as 150 mg in a 1 mL pre-filled syringes (PFS) and as 75 mg 
in 0.5 mL PFS. Secukinumab placebo for SC injection was supplied as 1 mL and 0.5 mL PFS, matching 
secukinumab  syringes.  Secukinumab  and  secukinumab  placebo  were  supplied  by  Novartis  Global 
Clinical Supplies. 
All subjects fulfilling all entry criteria were assigned to AIN457/secukinumab 75 or 150 mg, based on 
body weight (< 50 kg or ≥ 50 kg) and continued to receive an appropriate secukinumab dose at each 
visit based on their weight at that visit. At the Week 12 visit, all responders were eligible to enter TP2 
where they were randomized via IRT to one of the two treatment arms, active as secukinumab 75 or 
150 mg, or matching placebo based on their weight at that visit. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy:  The primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures used in this study are standard 
measures used across JIA trials.

All efficacy assessments were performed prior to administration of study treatment at that visit. 
Pharmacokinetics:  PK  samples  were  obtained  for  all  subjects  and  secukinumab  concentrations 
were  assessed  in  serum.  An  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  method  was  used  for 
bioanalytical  analysis  of  secukinumab  in  serum,  with  lower  limit  of  quantifications  (LLOQs)  of  80 
and 500 ng/mL in the two bioanalytical CRO’s involved in this study. 
Safety:  Safety  assessments  consisted  of  collecting  all  AEs  and  serious  adverse  event  (SAEs), 
including injection site reactions, with their severity and relationship to the study drug, abnormal 
findings  in  ECGs,  physical  examination  (including  height  and  body  weight),  vital  signs,  and 
laboratory  assessments  (haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  lipid  panel  and  urinalysis),  pregnancy 
and  assessment  of  fertility,  tolerability  of  secukinumab  and  anti-secukinumab  antibody 
development (immunogenicity). 
Statistical Methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  full  analysis  set  2  (FAS2)  for  TP2.  The  FAS  2  consist  of  all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in TP2. Following the intent-to-treat 
principle, subjects were analysed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization in 
TP2.  The  two  treatment  groups  were  compared  using  a  one-sided  stratified  Log-rank  test  with  the 
stratification  factor  of  JIA  category  (ERA  or  JPsA)  and  another  factor  methotrexate  (MTX)  use  at 
baseline  (yes  or  no)  at  the  2.5%  level  of  significance.  Hazard  ratios  and  their  associated  95% 
confidence  intervals  were  estimated  based  on  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with  treatment  and 
stratification factor as explanatory variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability to experience a 
flare  event  were  calculated  from  the  beginning  of  TP2  along  with  95%  confidence  intervals  using 
Greenwood’s formula. The cumulative probability to stay flare free (1-the probability of experiencing a 
flare)  was  plotted  against  time.  Specifically,  the  survival  analysis  of  time  to  flare  in  TP2  included 
randomized treatment, number of subjects, number of events, Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time 
to flare in days, hazard ratio (95% Confidence interval) and p-value for the Stratified log-rank test. In 
addition, a figure of Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability to stay flare free by treatment groups in 
TP2 was plotted against days. 
The analysis of secondary variables was descriptive only for FAS. Summary statistics were presented. 
Baseline, post-baseline and absolute change was presented for all summary statistics. 
The  analysis  of  safety  data  by  treatment  were  provided  for  each  Treatment  Period  separately  and  all 
periods combined, as appropriate. The analysis of safety data was conducted on the Safety Set, which 
included  subjects  who  received  any  study  treatment.  Safety  analyses  was  performed  on  treatment 
received  or  actual  treatment.  Safety  variables  were  tabulated  by  descriptive  statistics.  No  formal 
statistical testing was planned.

The  following  PK  parameters  was  determined:  Cmin,  ss.  All  completed  subjects  with  quantifiable  PK 
measurements  of  secukinumab  was  included  in  the  PK  data  analysis.  Serum  concentrations  was 
expressed  in  mass  per  volume  units.  PK  concentrations  were  summarized  by  Treatment  Period,  visit 
and  treatment  group.  In  addition  to  mean,  SD,  CV,  median  and  quartiles,  the  geometric  mean  and 
geometric CV and n(log) were presented. 
Results 
Number of subjects (planned and analysed) 
It  was  planned  that  approximately  80  subjects  were  to  be  enrolled  in  TP1  (to  reach  the  minimum 
required sample size of 60 subjects in TP2) and that every effort was to be made in order to randomize 
at least 20 subjects from each JIA category to TP2. 
A  total  of  97  subjects  were  screened,  of  which  86  subjects  (88.7%)  completed  and  11  subjects 
(11.3%) discontinued the screening phase. A total of 86 subjects from 32 sites entered into TP1 and 
subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio to secukinumab (37 subjects) or placebo (38 subjects) in TP2. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects enrolled in the study was 13.1 years (range 2 to 17 years). The majority of 
subjects were male (66.3%), predominantly White (95.3%), with mean weight and height of 56.0 kg 
and  158.0  cm,  respectively.  The  mean  BMI  was  approximately  21.7  kg/m2.  In  subjects  enrolled,  52 
subjects had ERA (60.5%) and 34 subjects had JPsA (39.5%) at baseline. 
The mean age of subjects randomized in TP2 was 12.8 years. Overall, the demographic and baseline 
characteristics of subjects randomized in TP2 were generally similar between the treatment groups and 
by each JIA category, ERA and JPsA,  with the exception of the male to female ratio for subjects with 
ERA (ERA: total 44 subjects, male 81.8%; JPsA: total 31 subjects, male 48.4%). The baseline disease 
characteristics of subjects by each JIA category in TP2 were comparable between the treatment groups 
and  were  generally  in  line  with  the  overall  population  in  TP1.  Subjects  who  entered  TP2  and  were 
randomized included those with active ERA (44 subjects, 58.7%) or JPsA (31 subjects, 41.3%). Values 
for  mean  JADAS-27  score,  JADAS-71  score,  total  enthesitis  count,  and  total  dactylitis  count  were 
similar  across  treatment  groups  in  TP2.  Over  65%  of  the  subjects  used  MTX  prior  to  randomization, 
with similar distribution among treatment groups and JIA categories.

The  JPsA  median  change  from  baseline  is  lower  when 
compared to ERA. This can be attributed to the lower baseline 
values for the JPsA (median CRP value at baseline 
for ERA: 6.98; for JPsA: 4.99)

until Week 12 (at Week 12 mean (SD) change from the 
baseline: -10.487 [7.2262]) 
•  A  similar rapid  decrease  in JADAS-27  in each of  the JIA 
category was observed (at Week 12, mean (SD) change

category was observed (at Week 12, mean (SD) change 
from the baseline, ERA: -11.794 [7.6803]; JPsA: -15.967 
[12.0101] 
Total enthesitis count

The  less  pronounced  improvement  from  baseline  in  subjects 
with ERA was possibly due to less dactylitis at baseline. 
In  TP2  also,  improvement  was  observed  from  baseline  at  all 
the JIA ACR response levels for secukinumab. and placebo:

Pharmacokinetic results  
Trough secukinumab serum concentrations at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 52, 76 and 104 weeks with 
the  three  latter  time  points  being  at  steady-state,  were  similar  in  the  two  weight  categories  of 
<50 kg and ≥50 kg. 
Safety results 
The  safety  profile  of  secukinumab  in  this  study  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  for 
secukinumab and there were no new or unexpected signals. 
The overall mean (±SD) duration of exposure to the study treatment was 601.0 ± 232.67 days, with a 
total  patient-time  of  141.5  PY.  Treatment  comparisons  between  secukinumab  and  placebo  in  TP2 
groups  have  not  been  made,  as  the  exposure  times  for  these  groups  were  different  over  the  entire 
treatment period. 
• 
There were no deaths reported during the entire treatment period of the study. 
•  Overall, 11 out of 86 subjects (12.8%) had incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs during the 
entire  treatment  period,  with Infections  and infestations  reported  as  most  commonly  affected 
SOC for SAEs (7/86 subjects, 8.1%). All SAEs by PT were single events with no trend over time 
observed in the types of SAEs. 
• 
The overall exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR, per 100 PY) of treatment-emergent SAEs 
by  any  primary  SOC  in  the  entire  treatment  period  was  8.2/100  PY  in  all  subjects.  The  most 
commonly  reported  SAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Infections  and  infestations  and  Gastrointestinal 
disorders (5.1/100 PY and 1.4/100 PY, respectively). 
•  Overall, 79 out of 86 subjects (91.9%) had incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in the entire 
treatment  period,  with  Infections  and  infestations  (68/86  subjects,  79.1%),  Gastrointestinal 
disorders (45/86 subjects, 52.3%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (32/86 
subjects,  37.2%)  reported  as  most  commonly  affected  SOC  for  AEs.  The  most  commonly 
reported  AEs  (in  ≥15%  subjects)  by  PT  in  the  entire  treatment  group  were  nasopharyngitis 
(27/86 subjects, 31.4%), diarrhoea (17/86 subjects, 19.8%), nausea (19/86 subjects, 22.1%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (19/86 subjects, 22.1%) and cough (13/86 subjects, 15.1%). 
• 
The  overall  EAIR  (per  100  PY)  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  by  any  primary  SOC  in  the  entire 
treatment  period  was  290.7/100  PY  in  all  subjects.  The  most  commonly  reported  SOCs  with 
AEs  were  Infections  and  infestations,  Gastrointestinal  disorders  and  Musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders (134.2/100PY, 50.4/100 PY, and 31.0/100 PY respectively). Mostly 
mild (40/86 subjects, 46.5%) and moderate (37/86 subjects, 43.0%) treatment emergent AEs 
were  reported  in  both  treatment  groups  during  the  entire  treatment  period.  Severe  events 
were reported in 2 subjects (2/86 subjects, 2.3%). The severe AEs reported were joint effusion 
in 1 subject and aphthous ulcer in another subject in TP1. 
• 
• 
For  the  entire  treatment  period,  8  out  of  86  subjects  (9.3%)  had  AEs  causing  study  drug 
discontinuation. All discontinuations due to AEs were reported by no more than 1-2 subjects in 
either  treatment  group.  Other  than  the  AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  of  severe 
joint  effusion  for  which  the  subject  recovered,  the  remaining  SAEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate 
severity. 
For  the  entire  treatment  period,  7  out  of  86  subjects  (8.1%)  had  AEs  leading  to  temporary 
dose  interruption.  In  TP2,  1  subject  each  had  AEs  diarrhoea  and  transaminases  increased  in 
the secukinumab treatment group only leading to temporary dose interruption.

•  Of  the  important  identified  risks  reported  for  the  entire  treatment  period,  the  SOC  infections 
and infestations (68/86 subjects, 79.1%) represented the most frequently reported risk among 
all risks from the RMP. The most frequently reported compound and class-related risk for the 
entire  treatment  period  was  skin  structure  infections  (21/86  subjects,  24.4%).  Inflammatory 
bowel  disease  (NMQ,  narrow  search)  for  the  important  potential  risk  of  Crohn's  disease 
revealed  1  SAE  with  mild  severity  in  the  secukinumab  treatment  group  in  TP2.  No  cases  of 
MACE, mycobacterial infections, hepatitis B reactivation, and malignancy were reported. 
•  Analysis of laboratory parameters, vital signs, urinalysis, and ECGs during the entire treatment 
period  showed  no  new  safety  signals.  Most of  the  abnormalities  reported in haematology  and 
clinical  chemistry  were  of  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2.  Grade  3  abnormalities  in  haematology 
parameter  of  absolute  neutrophils  (<1.0-0.5  x10e9/L)  were  observed  in  2  subjects  (2/85 
subjects,  2.4%)  in  secukinumab  treatment  group  over  the  entire  treatment  period.  These 
abnormalities  occurred  during  TP2.  Grade  3  abnormalities  in  clinical  chemistry  parameter  of 
serum  aspartate  aminotransferase  (>5.0-20.0×ULN)  were  observed  in  1  subject  (1/86 
subjects, 1.2%) in secukinumab treatment group over the entire treatment period. This Grade 
3 abnormality was observed during TP3. Grade 3 abnormalities in clinical chemistry parameter 
of  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  (>5.0-20.0×ULN)  were  observed  in  2  subjects  (2/86 
subjects,  2.3%)  in  the  secukinumab  treatment  group  over  the  entire  treatment  group.  These 
Grade 3 abnormalities were observed during TP2. One of these subjects was receiving MTX at 
the time of Grade 3 abnormality. 
• 
The overall incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities for the entire treatment period was low. No 
subject was reported with Hy's Law laboratory criteria during the entire treatment period.  
•  No  treatment  emergent  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  were  detected  in  any  sample  of  subjects 
within the secukinumab treatment groups. One subject was ADA-positive at Baseline only and 
negative during treatment. 
Conclusions by the Applicant 
•  Secukinumab  demonstrated  a  significantly  longer  time  to  flare  in  TP2,  thus  had  significantly 
superior  efficacy  over  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  JIA  (combined  ERA  and  JPsA 
groups)  at  a  dose  of  150  mg  for  subjects  ≥50  kg  and  75  mg  for  subjects  <50  kg,  given  at 
Week  0,  1,  2,  3,  4  and  every  4  weeks  thereafter.  Trends  of  prolongation  in  time  to  disease 
flare  was  observed  in  both  categories  of  JIA  subjects  studied  (ERA  and  JPsA)  treated  with 
secukinumab compared to placebo in TP2. 
• 
• 
• 
There was a rapid improvement in all subjects in almost all JIA ACR response categories which 
continued through Week 12 in TP1. This trend was observed in each of the JIA categories, ERA 
and JPsA. 
Exposure of secukinumab in serum was similar in the two weight categories of <50 kg and ≥50 
kg, which justifies the dosing rationale for subjects with body weights <50 kg.  
The safety profile of secukinumab in this study of paediatric population with Juvenile Idiopathic 
arthritis  subtypes  of  psoriatic  and  enthesitis-related  arthritis  showed  no  new  or  unexpected 
safety signals and was consistent with the overall safety profile of secukinumab based on the 
existing  extensive  safety  data  across  multiple  indications,  including  psoriasis,  PsA,  and  axial 
SpA (both non-radiographic axial SpA and AS).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects (by the CHMP) 
In  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as  amended,  the  Applicant  has 
submitted the final report of study CAIN457F2304. The study CAIN457F2304 is a  Phase III, placebo-
controlled,  event-driven,  randomized  withdrawal  design  study  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  clinical 
efficacy  of  secukinumab  compared  with  placebo  in  paediatric  patients  with  active  JIA  (ERA  or  JPsA 
categories).  As  this  study  recruited  patients  aged  2  to  <18  years,  the  study  results  are  submitted 
under Article 46 of the EU paediatric regulation. 
No  detailed  assessment  of  these  data  are  performed in  connection  with  this  submission,  as  a  type  II 
variation application is planned to be submitted in June, 2021, (for a procedure start date on July 17th 
2021) for the JIA categories of ERA and JPsA. Labeling will be submitted at that time. The submission 
will include, among other submission related documents, a summary of clinical efficacy, a summary of 
clinical  safety,  and  a  clinical  overview.  The  results  of  study  CAIN457F2304  will  be  used  to  support  a 
label update. Full assessment of the study will thus be performed within the upcoming type II variation 
application. 
For purposes of compliance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, this P46 is 
considered fulfilled. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required for this P46; however, the MAH has submitted a type II variation with the 
same study results in parallel to the P46; the CHMP will assess the data in further details in the context 
of this type II variation application before any conclusion on product information amendments can be 
made.

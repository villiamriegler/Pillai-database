Chemical class: 
Teriflunomide also referred to as HMR1726 during development, is a 
novel immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties. 
Summary of mode action: 
It selectively and reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme DHO-DH, 
required for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. As a consequence, 
teriflunomide reduces the activation and proliferation of stimulated 
lymphocytes which need de novo synthesis of pyrimidine to expand. 
Slowly dividing or resting cells which rely on the salvage pathway for 
pyrimidine synthesis are unaffected by teriflunomide. The exact 
mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is 
not fully understood but may include reduced number of activated 
lymphocytes in CNS. It is likely that teriflunomide diminishes in periphery 
the numbers of activated lymphocytes available to migrate into the CNS.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 
INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Teriflunomide is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older 
with relapsing-remitting MS.  
The epidemiology of MS and the relapsing-remitting form of MS is presented in the Table 6. Of 
note, data presented in this section are for total MS diagnoses, of which approximately 85% of 
people are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. 
Table 6 - Epidemiology of multiple sclerosis  
Indication 
Multiple sclerosis 
Incidence 
Prevalence 
Demographics of the 
population in the 
authorized/proposed 
indication  
There is a wide range in the incidence of MS reported globally. 1,2,3 The average incidence 
has been estimated at 4.3 per 100 000 person-years. 4,5 Incidence rates in North America 
range from 5.1 to 46.3 per 100 000 person-years, 5,6,7 European studies report a range 
from 5 to 19.5 per 100 000 person-years, 1,5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 one study has 
reported incidence in Australia to be 6.7 per 100 000 person-years 19 and Asia has incidence 
rate ranging from 0.68 to 6.5 per 100 000 person-years. 20,21,22,23,24,25,26  
The estimated number of people living with MS has increased over time from 2.3 million 
in 2013 (33 per 100 000) to 2.8 million (36 per 100 000) in 2020. 1 The prevalence varies 
greatly by geography, it is the highest in North America and Europe (>100 per 100 000 with 
some countries reporting >300 per 100 000) and lowest in Africa and Western Pacific 
(≤5 per 100 000). 1,3,6,20,27,28 It is important to note that even within regions the prevalence 
may vary by country. For example, in Europe, the highest prevalence is in San Marino 
(337 per 100 000) and the lowest in Albania (30 per 100 000). 1 Multiple sclerosis Prevalence 
in Asia varied from <1 per 100 000 in Japan to 115 per 100 000 in Iran. 
20,21,22,23,24,25,29,30,31 In South America, prevalence varied 
from 1.5 to 23 per 100 000 with the highest prevalence in Argentina. 32,33,34 
Geography, race, gender and age are all important demographic factors. 
Risk factors for the disease 
Potential risk factors as summarized in a review article by Ascherio et al (2016). 35 
•  Latitude and geography: those further from the equator being at higher risk-although this 
gradient has attenuated in the northern hemisphere. Both incidence and prevalence of 
disease vary widely by geographic area and appear to be increasing over time. 2,35  
•  Gender: women have a higher risk than men. The ratio varies from 1.5:1 to 2.5 to 1 and 
may differ geographically and by time. 
•  Age: incidence is low in childhood and reaches a peak between 25 and 35 years and then 
declines. 
•  Race: Whites, especially of Northern European descent, seem to have the highest risk. 
Although incidence may be increasing in US blacks. 
•  Vitamin D deficiency: inadequate vitamin D increases risk (especially in early life). 
•  Genetic: >100 genes are implicated in MS. 
•  Obesity in early life increases risk. 
•  Epstein-Barr virus that resulted in mononucleosis increases risk. 
•  Smoking: smokers have a higher risk than nonsmokers and MS risk increases as smoking 
duration and intensity increase. 
Main existing 
treatment options 
The  clinical  armamentarium  for  treating  MS  has  further  increased  over  the  past  years. 
Treatment options in relapsing remitting MS are IFNβ-1a, IFNβ-1b, GA, teriflunomide, dimethyl 
Indication 
Multiple sclerosis 
fumarate, diroximel fumarate, fingolimod, cladribine, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, ocrezumab, 
mitoxantrone, ofatumumab, ozanimod and ponesimod. 
There is no global consensus on treatment strategy and/or algorithm. In an individualized 
approach, treatment decisions are based on the efficacy and safety profile of each drug, on 
their mechanism of action, and on patient preference and convenience. Only a few 
treatments are available as an oral dosage form: fingolimod, fumarates, teriflunomide and 
cladribine. Teriflunomide is among the drugs with broad indication in RMS, ie, with no 
restriction to forms with high disease activity. 
Natural history of the 
indicated condition in 
the untreated 
population including 
mortality and 
morbidity 
Multiple sclerosis has a variable course. Studies in the US and Europe have found that 
relative to the general population MS is associated with increased premature mortality 
(RR 1.7-3.5 fold). 36 The variable course of disease can lead to progression to physical and 
cognitive disabilities, decreased quality of life, and comorbidities (see comorbidity section). 
Life expectancy may be reduced in MS populations by 3 to 11 years. 12,37,38,39,40 
Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common neurological disorders and causes of disability 
in young adults. 
Important 
co-morbidities  
The epidemiology of the MS specific co-morbidities, as well as other most frequent conditions 
observed in MS patients are:  
•  Depression, 36,37,38,39,40,41 treated with antidepressant drugs (SSRI, TCA, MAOI), 
anxiolytics 
•  Urinary tract infection 36,42,43 treated with antibiotics 
•  Diabetes 36,44,45,46 treated with antidiabetic drugs (insulins, biguanides, sulfonylureas) 
•  Hypertension 44,45 treated with antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta blockers, 
angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) 
•  Hypercholesterolemia/hyperlipidemia 44,45 treated with lipid lowering drugs (fibrates, 
statins)  
•  Arthritis 47 treated with analgesics, Anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, NSAIDs) 
•  Fatigue 48 treated with modafinil, amantadine 
•  Cognitive impairment 49 
Of note, there are substantial gaps regarding co-morbidities in the literature especially in 
regions outside of North America and Europe. Even within North America and Europe 
findings are inconsistent. 41

Incidence  
Multiple sclerosis in 10 years or older children 
Studies reporting the incidence of MS in 10 years or older children are scarce. A 
meta-analysis of data from twelve countries reported overall incidence 
between 0.05 to 2.85 and estimated pooled global incidence of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.35-1.40) 
per 100 000 individuals annually. 50 The reported incidence rates in Europe range 
from 0.6 to 6.41 per 100 000 population per year 51,52,53 a UAE based study reported 
incidence of 2.3 per 100 000 population per year among 10 to 14-year-old 
and 7.2 per 100 000 population per year among 15 to 19 years old, 54 another ASIA

of 0.08 per 100 000 population per year among 15 to 18-year-old Tunisians. 56 
Similar to incidence, studies estimating the prevalence of MS among 10 years and above 
are scarce. A meta-analysis study of data from ten countries reported estimated pooled 
global prevalence of 8.11 (95% CI: 2.28-13.93) per 100 000 people. 50 The reported 
prevalence in Italy among 12 to 18 year-olds is 26.92 per 100 000 population, 51 the 
prevalence of MS in 15 to 19 years of age in UAE has been reported to 
be 30.7 per 100 000 population. 54 Prevalence in US is lower compared to the two 
studies above, 2.3 per 100 000 population among 10 to 14 years of age 
and 14.6 per 100 000 population in 15 to 19 years of age. 57 
Race, gender, age, and diet are all important demographic factors.  
Risk factors for the disease  
•  Family history: Positive family history of MS increases the risk. 52 
•  Gender: Occurrence of MS is similar in females and males (Females to males-1.2:1) 
up to the age of 12 years. Females predominance is observed from 12 years of age 
(Female to male: 2.8:1). 52 
•  Age: incidence increases with age, most notably after 12 years of age. 52 
•  Race: Whites, seem to have the highest risk. 58 
•  Iron: Iron levels below recommended levels are associated with increased risk. 
•  Vitamin D deficiency: inadequate vitamin D increases risk. 59,60  
•  Obesity increases the risk of MS in children. 59,60 
•  Epstein-Barr virus infections increase the risk of pediatric MS. 61 
Fingolimod and teriflunomide are the only drugs approved to treat MS in 
children 10 years and above. 62,63 However, other MS drugs are also used but their 
usage in the pediatric population is based on observational studies. 64 These drugs 
include IFNβ-1a, GA, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate and mitoxantrone. 64 
About half of the pediatric MS population shows neurological episodes with two years of 
onset. 65 The median time from MS onset to secondary progression is about 28 years. 65 
Pediatric MS patients take approximately 10 years longer to reach secondary progression 
and irreversible disability and reach these landmarks at age approximately 10 years 
younger than adult-onset MS. 65,66 
Multiple sclerosis in the pediatric population has a wide range of effects on patients 
including, cognitive impairment, sensory deficits, visual and motor deficits, fatigue, 
reduced physical activity. All of these effects lead to increase in disability among patients. 
60,61,67 
Studies relating to co-morbidities in pediatric MS population are extremely scarce, few of 
the reported comorbidities include  
•  Depression reported in up to 50% of pediatric MS population. 68 
•  Anxiety disorders reported in about 64% of patients. 68 
•  Fatigue in about three forth of pediatric MS patients is reported. 68

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII:  NON-CLINICAL PART OF 
THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
The preclinical development of teriflunomide was conducted as following:  
Teriflunomide was evaluated in non-clinical safety studies, consistent with the claimed 
indication, the intended route of administration, and the duration of treatment proposed in 
humans. 
In general, the repeat-dose animal toxicity of teriflunomide was a reflection of exaggerated 
pharmacologic activity (ie, inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] synthesis in rapidly 
dividing cells). 69 Primary adverse events (AEs) were seen in bone marrow (decreased 
erythropoiesis and/or granulopoiesis), lymphoid organs (atrophy), oral cavity/gastrointestinal 
tract (epithelial degenerative changes, erosions, ulcers, bleeding), and reproductive organs 
(tubular degeneration of the testes in rats and mice, and atrophy of the ovary in mice). 
Anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, decreased platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), effects on 
the immune system (decreased lymphocytes, white blood cell [WBC], cluster differentiation 
[CD] CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, B cells, immunoglobulin M [IgM] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]), 
and secondary infections were related to the effects on the bone marrow and/or lymphoid 
organs. Hemorrhages in multiple organs (sometimes lethal) occurred secondary to the reduced 
platelet counts. Regenerative hemopoietic effects were sometimes seen (increased 
hemopoietic cells in bone marrow and extramedullary hemopoiesis in the spleen). 
Other effects were not clearly associated with the pharmacologic activity of teriflunomide. 
Heinz bodies in erythrocytes and increased methemoglobin were indicative of an oxidative 
effect on red blood cells (RBCs) and may be associated with the aniline structure of the 
molecule. Pancreatic findings in dogs (acinar degeneration and individual acinar cell necrosis 
with loss of acini, fibrosis, and a minimal mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate) were not 
correlated with clinical signs or alterations in clinical pathology parameters (amylase, lipase 
or trypsin-like immunoreactivity). 
The systemic exposure at the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in rats and dogs was 
less than the human exposure at 14 mg teriflunomide. The pronounced species differences in 
the pharmacologic activity of teriflunomide (Table 8) may explain the fractional exposure 
ratios.

In genotoxicity studies with teriflunomide, negative results were obtained in vitro for 
mutagenicity and in vivo for clastogenicity. A positive result observed in the in vitro 
chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes (≥300 μg/mL) was likely related to the 
pharmacologic action of the drug; this conclusion is supported by the reduced cytotoxicity 
and clastogenicity that were observed with uridine supplementation. The highest 
concentration tested without an effect was 6 times greater than the mean human exposure at 
the 14 mg dose of teriflunomide.  
 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year bioassay in rats up to the maximally 
tolerated dose of 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 1/2 the maximum human teriflunomide 
exposure based on area under the curve [AUC]) or mice up to the maximally tolerated dose 
of 12 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the maximum human teriflunomide exposure based 
on AUC).  
4-trifluoro-methylaniline (4-TFMA), a minor metabolite of teriflunomide, was positive in 
genotoxicity studies conducted in vitro while negative results were observed in vivo. The 
4-TFMA concentrations used in the in vitro genotoxicity studies are at least 1000 times higher 
than the mean plasma levels in patients exposed to 4-TFMA as a metabolite of teriflunomide. 
No neoplastic findings were observed in 2-year oral carcinogenicity studies of teriflunomide 
in rats and mice, which would have also evaluated the 4-TFMA metabolite.  
Teriflunomide had no effect on mating performance or fertility in male or female rats. A 
slight decrease in epididymal sperm count (-12.5%) and effects on early embryonic and fetal 
development were seen in males and females, respectively, when treated separately. 
Teriflunomide is embryo-toxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits when administered during 
organogenesis. Exposure ratios at the NOAELs were less than the human exposure at 
the 14 mg dose of teriflunomide. Administration of teriflunomide to pregnant rats during 
gestation and lactation also produced adverse effects in the offspring. However, no effects 
were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats that received teriflunomide during gestation 
only in order to avoid potential toxicity related to transfer of test article in the milk. 
14C-teriflunomide-derived radioactivity was excreted via lactation in rats at 
approximately 23.3%. 
Juvenile rats were orally administered teriflunomide once daily for 7 weeks, beginning on 
Postnatal Day (PND) 21. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and signs of toxicity were 
generally similar to adult rats. There were no adverse effects on growth, physical or 
neurological development, learning and memory, locomotor activity, sexual development, or 
fertility. Decreased body weight gain and food consumption, effects on erythron parameters 
(minimally decreased hemoglobin, red cell volume, packed cell volume; minimally increased 
reticulocytes and red cell distribution width), minimally decreased total protein and globulin 
concentrations, minimally increased cholesterol, and increased triglyceride concentrations 
were observed. Changes in immune function occurred (failure to mount an appropriate 
immune response after two antigen challenges, greatly reduced concentrations of IgM and 
IgG, and markedly increased B lymphocyte counts). Microscopic changes were observed in 
the spleen (increased incidence and/or severity of hemopoiesis and a very minor reduction of 
lymphoid hyperplasia), mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches (minor 
reduction in germinal follicles). At the end of the 8-week recovery period, all findings partly 
or completely reversed. 
Effects on the immune system were identified following 1-month oral administration of 
teriflunomide to adult rats. Decreased lymphocytes, WBC counts, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, and 
B cells were observed. Following Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH) immunization, a 
dose-related decrease in IgM and IgG occurred, with effects on both the primary and 
secondary response. The secondary response was slightly greater than the primary response, 
except for the high dose female IgG, where the secondary response was less than the primary 
response. Effects were observed as low as 1 mg/kg/day. 
The safety findings of teriflunomide identified in rodent and non-rodent species in the 
non-clinical studies are summarized in Table 9, with their toxicological relevance put into the 
perspective of human usage.

Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to human usage 
Toxicity 
•  Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose 
toxicity studies  
-  Pancreas: Acinar degeneration and necrosis, with 
loss of acini, fibrosis, and minimal infiltration by 
mononuclear inflammatory cells; observed only in 
dogs (12 month NOAEL: 0.2 mg/kg/day, Day 364 
mean AUC0-24 (area under the plasma 
concentration curve versus time 
from 0 to 24 hours) of 26.6 and 20.2 μg*h/mL for 
males and females, respectively).  
There were no clinical signs or alterations in 
clinical pathology parameters (amylase, lipase or 
trypsin-like immunoreactivity) that correlated with 
the light microscopic changes in the pancreas.  
This effect identified pancreas as a target organ in dogs 
following chronic treatment. 
Association between the pharmacologic activity and 
pancreatic toxicity of teriflunomide has not been clearly 
established. 
This non-clinical finding prompted a close monitoring of 
potential pancreatic effects (via ultrasound imaging and 
pancreatic laboratory enzymes) in the Phase 2/3 clinical 
studies. 
In the postmarketing setting, cases of pancreatitis were 
observed with teriflunomide. Acute pancreatitis is an 
important identified risk with teriflunomide and is 
described in [Part II module SVII]. 
-  Oral cavity/gastrointestinal tract: Erosions, 
This observed effect may reflect 
ulcers, bleeding, necrosis, and/or degeneration; 
observed in mice (3 month NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, 
Day 85 mean AUC0-24 of 1660 and 1040 μg*h/mL 
for males and females, respectively) and dogs 
(3-month NOAEL: <0.8 mg/kg/day, Day 88 mean 
AUC0-24 of <107 and <118 μg*h/mL in males and 
females, respectively). 
-  Bone marrow: Decreased erythropoiesis or 
granulopoiesis, resulting in anemia, leukopenia, 
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
hemorrhages; observed in mice (3-month 
NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, Day 85 mean AUC0-24 
of 1660 and 1040 μg*h/mL for males and females, 
respectively) and dogs (3-month NOAEL: 
<0.8 mg/kg/day, Day 88 mean AUC0-24 of 
<107 and <118 μg*h/mL in males and females, 
respectively.  
•  The immunomodulatory activity of the drug leading 
to the worsening status of certain infections (eg, 
herpetic or bacterial infections) or  
•  An effect on rapidly dividing cells in the 
gastrointestinal tract due to the antiproliferative 
activity. In clinical studies, a low incidence of oral 
herpes was observed with 
teriflunomide 14 mg (3.4%) as compared to 
placebo (1.4%). Clinical complications such as 
infections and serious opportunistic infections have 
been considered as important risks and are 
described in [Part II module SVII]. 
The effect on bone marrow is related to the 
exaggerated pharmacologic activity of the drug 
(inhibition of DNA synthesis), due to 
exposure/sensitivity of different species. 
The following was observed in patients treated with 
teriflunomide:  
•  Decrease in WBC affecting the neutrophil and 
lymphocyte counts (observed decrease of 
about 15% for both). 
•  Anemia observed in 1.2 to 2.4% patients. 
•  Moderate decrease in platelet count (about 10%). 
Hematologic effects are considered as an important 
identified risk and is described in [Part II module SVII].  
Hematologic effects are confirmed with clinical data with 
WBC.  
 
Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to human usage 
This observed effect reflects the exaggerated 
pharmacologic activity of the compound (inhibition of 
DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells), impacting the 
immune system (decreased lymphocyte production). 
A 15% decrease in lymphocyte count was observed in 
clinical trials with teriflunomide. No signal (imbalance) 
for serious infection or serious opportunistic infection 
was observed in clinical studies. 
“Hematologic effects” and “Infections” have been 
considered as important identified risks and are 
described in [Part II module SVII]. “Serious opportunistic 
infections, including PML” has been considered as an 
important potential risk and is described in 
[Part II module SVII]. 
These effects, unrelated to the pharmacologic activity of 
the drug, are indicative of an oxidative effect on RBC 
due to the aniline structure of the compound. However, 
the clinical impact appears limited as RBC and 
hemoglobin values remained stable over time with 
teriflunomide (change from baseline was <2% and <3% 
for RBC and hemoglobin, respectively). 
No effect on fertility was seen in male or female rats in 
separate studies. 
In clinical trials, pregnancies were observed in both 
pregnant women treated with teriflunomide as well as in 
pregnant partners of male patients treated with 
teriflunomide (see [Part II module SVII]). 
-  Effects on Immune System and Lymphoid 
Organs: Decreased WBC, lymphocytes, 
lymphocyte subpopulations CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, 
and B cells in rats. Dose related decrease in IgM 
and IgG compared to controls following KLH 
immunization. Effects on both the primary and 
secondary response. The secondary response 
was generally slightly greater than the primary 
response. The NOAEL for effects on the immune 
system in rats was <1 mg/kg/day. 
Spleen: Follicular atrophy or hypoplasia; observed 
in mice (3-month NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, Day 85 
mean AUC0-24 of 1660 and 1040 μg*h/mL for 
males and females, respectively), rats (1-month 
NOAEL: 1.0 mg/kg/day IV, Day 28 mean AUC0-24 
of 16.5 and 17.1 μg*h/mL for males and females, 
respectively), and dogs (3-month 
NOAEL: 2.5 mg/kg/day, Day 88 mean AUC0-24 
of 680 and 590 μg*h/mL in males and females, 
respectively).  
Thymus: Thymic atrophy; observed in mice 
(3-month NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, Day 85 mean 
AUC0-24 of 1660 and 1040 μg*h/mL for males and 
females, respectively) and rats (6-month 
NOAEL: 0.3 mg/kg/day, Day 181 mean AUC0-24 
of 26.1 and 29.4 μg*h/mL for males and females, 
respectively).  
-  Red blood cells: Heinz bodies, Howell-Jolly 
bodies, and/or increased methemoglobin; 
observed in mice (3-month NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, 
Day 85 mean AUC0-24 of 1660 and 1040 μg*h/mL 
for males and females, respectively) and dogs 
(3-month NOAEL: 0.8 mg/kg/day, Day 88 mean 
AUC0-24 of 107 and 118 μg*h/mL in males and 
females, respectively). 
•  Reproductive/developmental toxicity studies 
-  Fertility: In repeat dose toxicity studies, tubular 
degeneration of the testes and atrophy of the 
ovary were observed in mice (3-month 
NOEL: 5 mg/kg/day, Day 85 mean AUC0-24 
of 147 and 97.5 μg*h/mL for males and females, 
respectively) and/or rats (1-month 
NOEL: 1 mg/kg/day IV, Day 28 mean AUC0-24 
of 16.5 and 17.2 μg*h/mL for males and females, 
respectively). 
Two separate fertility studies were conducted, one 
in male rats and one in female rats. In males, a 
slight decrease in sperm count was observed. 
There was no effect on either male or female 
fertility. The NOAEL for fertility was 10 mg/kg/day 
in males and 8.6 mg/kg/day in females. 
 
 
Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to human usage 
-  Embryo-fetal Toxicity:  
Pregnancy in treated women 
Although teriflunomide was not intentionally 
administered to pregnant women, pregnancy occurred 
in some women treated with teriflunomide during the 
clinical trial program. Teriflunomide was discontinued 
immediately after pregnancy was discovered and the 
patients were required to undergo an accelerated 
elimination procedure. No structural defects were 
reported in any of the newborn babies. 
Nevertheless, based on embryo-fetal toxicity observed 
in animal studies, teratogenicity has been considered as 
an important potential risk in pregnant women 
(see [Part II module SVII]). 
Pregnancy in female partners of male patients  
The risk of male-mediated embryo-fetal toxicity through 
teriflunomide treatment is considered low. The 
estimated female plasma exposure via the semen of a 
treated patient is expected to be 100 times lower than 
the plasma exposure observed at steady state 
after 14 mg of oral teriflunomide. There were no 
external malformations in the offspring of male rats 
administered teriflunomide for at least 10 weeks prior to 
mating with untreated female rats. Genotoxicity was not 
observed in vivo in 3 species. The highest concentration 
without an effect in the in vitro chromosome aberration 
test in human lymphocytes was 6 times greater than the 
mean human exposure at the 14 mg dose of 
teriflunomide. The risk of male-mediated embryo-fetal 
toxicity is mentioned in the labeling however the risk is 
not considered an important one.  
Teratogenicity not confirmed in human. Adequate 
prevention is needed and further risk documentation. 
Therefore, the risk has been considered as an important 
potential risk (see [Part II module SVII]). 
Effects observed in the offspring of female rats 
treated prior to mating up to gestation day 6: 
decreased fetal body weight, total 
post-implantation loss, increased early 
resorptions, decreased number of fetuses per 
litter, and isolated malformations. The NOAEL for 
early embryonic development was less 
than 0.84 mg/kg/day. 
Malformations observed in the offspring of 
pregnant rats treated during organogenesis: 
microophthalmia or anophthalmia, accompanied 
by aplasia lentis and decreased orbit size; 
hydrocephalus; edematous fetus; hematocyst on 
parietal bone; brachygnathia inferior; bent tarsal 
region of the hindpaw; fragmented, dysplastic and 
fused skull bones; multiple anomalies of the 
vertebral column; and alterations of ribs and 
pectoral girdle. Exposure at the NOAEL 
(1.0 mg/kg/day) for teratogenicity and 
embryolethality was less than the human 
exposure at 14 mg/day. 
Malformations observed in the offspring of 
pregnant rabbits treated during organogenesis: 
malformations of the forelimbs (short and 
misshapen ulna, absent radius, brachydactyly); 
absence of kidney, adrenal, and ureter; cleft lip 
and palate; growth retardation; hyperflexion of the 
forepaws; malpositioned branch of the carotid; 
anomalies of the lung lobes and sternebrae; and 
delayed ossification of several bones. Exposure at 
the NOAEL (1.0 mg/kg/day) for teratogenicity and 
embryolethality was less than the human 
exposure at 14 mg/day. 
Staged treatment at critical 3-day intervals during 
gestation in rats still resulted in embryo-fetal 
toxicity and teratogenicity, including total 
post-implantation loss or some degree of 
developmental toxicity consistent with the findings 
described above. 
-  Excretion into milk: Milk excretion of 
14C-teriflunomide in rats showed radioactivity 
excreted via lactation at approximately 23.3%.  
Adverse effects observed in the offspring of rats 
treated during gestation and lactation: limb defects 
and impaired coat growth sometimes associated 
with skin discoloration; corneal opacity, eye 
discharge, and negative pupillary reflex in a few 
pups; mean fetal weight per litter slightly 
decreased. Effects on coat growth resolved but 
limb defects persisted in a few pups after 
weaning. No effects on sexual maturation, 
No clinical information is available in lactating women 
exposed to teriflunomide. 
Labeling information includes a statement that it is not 
known whether teriflunomide is excreted in human milk. 
Since, teriflunomide is excreted in milk in rats, many 
drugs are excreted in human milk and there is a 
potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants 
from teriflunomide, labeling also includes a statement 
not recommending continued teriflunomide treatment 
while nursing and that a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug,

learning, memory, motor activity, startle response, 
reproductive ability, estrous cycles, mating 
behavior, fertility and fecundity, or early embryonic 
development. The NOAEL in the offspring 
was 0.10 mg/kg/day. Of importance, similar 
adverse findings were not seen in an exploratory 
study where teriflunomide was administered 
at 1.0 mg/kg/day during the gestation period and 
not during lactation to avoid transfer in the milk. 
Under those conditions, the NOEL in the offspring 
was 1.0 mg/kg/day. 
•  Key findings in juvenile rats 
-  Erythron parameters (minimally decreased 
hemoglobin, red cell volume, packed cell volume; 
minimally increased reticulocytes and red cell 
distribution width; increased incidence and/or 
severity of hemopoiesis in the spleen). Effects on 
erythropoiesis, including anemia, previously 
observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in 
sexually mature mice, rats, and dogs. 
-  Immune function (failure to mount appropriate 
immune response after antigen, greatly reduced 
IgM and IgG concentrations, markedly increased 
B lymphocyte counts). Effects on immune function 
and microscopic findings in lymphoid 
tissues/organs previously see in sexually mature 
rats. Reason for increased B lymphocyte counts in 
juvenile rats compared to a slightly lower 
B lymphocyte count in sexually mature female rats 
is unknown but may be related to differences in 
treatment duration and/or exposure. 
-  Lymphoid organs/tissues (minor reductions of 
lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleen; minor 
reduction in germinal follicles in the mesenteric 
and mandibular lymph nodes and Peyer’s 
patches). 
-  At the end of the 8-week recovery period, all 
findings partly or completely reversed. 
-  Juvenile NOAEL: 0.3 mg/kg/day. Plasma 
exposures (AUC0-24 hours) at the NOAEL 
were 16 100 ng.h/mL (males) and 20 500 ng.h/mL 
(females). 
•  Carcinogenicity  
-  Malignancy: Teriflunomide was positive for 
genotoxicity in the in vitro chromosome aberration 
test in human lymphocytes. Supplementation with 
uridine reduced the cytotoxicity and the magnitude 
of the clastogenic effect. The highest 
concentration without an effect (250 μg/mL) 
was 6 times higher than the mean human 
The positive response observed in the in vitro 
chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes is 
likely related to the pharmacologic action of the drug 
(nucleotide pool imbalance due to DHO-DH inhibition). 
As such, it is considered a threshold effect.  
The 4-TFMA concentrations used in the in vitro

4-Trifluoro-Methylaniline, a minor metabolite of 
teriflunomide, was positive for genotoxicity in vitro,

Teriflunomide was non-carcinogenic in 2 rodent 
species up to the maximal tolerated dose. The 
exposure ratios at the NOEL for neoplasms

approximately 5 times in the mouse and <1X in 
the rat. 
Although no signal was observed for malignancy in the 
clinical studies, since teriflunomide impacts the immune 
system, malignancies (including lymphoproliferative 
disorders) was listed in the RMP as an important 
potential risk till the RMP V7.0 and has been removed 
from RMP V7.2. It is being monitored through routine

and 14 mg/day as adjunct therapy to a stable dose of IFN-β compared to placebo and IFN-β. 
Clinical pharmacology 
In adults: 
The PKs and pharmacodynamics of teriflunomide were assessed in 20 clinical pharmacology 
studies in adult population. Two hundred and thirty-two (232) healthy subjects were exposed to a 
single oral dose from 7 to 70 mg. Among them, 6 subjects were exposed to a single 10 mg IV 
administration. In addition, 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and 17 subjects with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment were exposed to a single dose of teriflunomide 14 mg. 
Two hundred and forty-six (246) subjects were exposed to repeated doses of teriflunomide 
following a supratherapeutic regimen (repeated once daily oral doses of 70 mg up to 14 days) or a 
dosing regimen used to achieve concentrations in the therapeutic range (70 mg once daily 
for 3 to 4 days followed by 14 mg once daily for 8 to 11 days orally) or 2 consecutive doses 
of 100 mg/day. 
At the end of all clinical studies, either cholestyramine or activated charcoal was administered to 
accelerate the elimination of teriflunomide. 
In children: 
In pediatric patients enrolled in the EFC11759/TERIKIDS study with body weight above 40 kg 
treated with 14 mg once daily, exposures are in the range to those observed in adult patients treated 
with the same dosage regimen. In addition, 98.6% of patients (145/147) weighing more than 40 kg 
needed 14 mg once daily to reach exposures similar to the steady state exposures in adults being 
treated with 14 mg once daily. 
In pediatric patients enrolled in the EFC11759 TERIKIDS weighing 40 kg or less, 7 mg once daily 
dosing regimen led to exposures in the range to those observed in adult patients treated with 14 mg 
once daily. In addition, similar steady state exposures were documented in these pediatric patients 
after 14 mg every-other-day or 7 mg once daily dosing regimen. 
Overall Clinical trial exposure 
Overall teriflunomide exposure in the clinical program is detailed in Table 10 to Table 18 for adult 
population and Table 19 to Table 21 for pediatric population as follows: 
Exposure in Adult Population 
Pool A1 (placebo-controlled) consist of data from the 4 completed phase 2/3 monotherapy studies: 
phase 2 study 2001 (proof of concept), and phase 3 studies EFC6049/TEMSO, 
EFC10531/TOWER, and EFC6260/TOPIC. Follow up was 9 months for study 2001 and 2 years for 
TEMSO, and an average follow-up of 1.5 years and 1.3 years for TOWER and TOPIC, 
respectively.  
Pool B (Active Treatment) consists of data from 2001 + LTS6048 (extension of 2001, the Placebo 
period of main study excluded for placebo switch patients), EFC6049/TEMSO+LTS6050 
(extension of EFC6049/TEMSO), and EFC10891/TENERE. Average follow up 
is 6.3 years,4.7 years, and 1.2 years, respectively. 
Exposure in Pediatric Population 
A summary of the extent of exposure to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) during the 
combined double-blind and open-label treatment periods is presented in Table 20. 
A total of 152 participants (100 participants in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group 
and 52 participants in the placebo/teriflunomide group) were treated in the open-label period of the 
study. The cumulative duration of treatment exposure (the sum of all participants’ duration of 
treatment exposure per treatment group) from enrollment to the open-label period 
was 36.18 participant-years for the teriflunomide 7 mg dose and 265.82 participant-years for 
the 14 mg dose Table 21. 
Most of the participants (132 participants) received 14 mg teriflunomide. No participants 
received 3.5 mg in the open-label period. No difference in the duration of study treatment was noted 
between the 7 mg and 14 mg teriflunomide groups. 
The median duration of study treatment was 683.0 days for the teriflunomide 7 mg group 
and 680.0 days for the 14 mg group. Most of the participants received the IMP (62.5% in the 7 mg 
group and 62.9% in the 14 mg group) for more than 96 weeks (Table 21).

SIV.2 
LIMITATIONS TO DETECT ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES  
Given the large clinical development, including more than 4500 treated patients in clinical trials and 
621 859 patient years in the postmarketing setting including almost 10 years of marketing 
experience, the limitation relative to frequent adverse drug reaction detection in clinical trials can be 
considered as no longer relevant. 
SIV.3 
LIMITATIONS IN RESPECT TO POPULATIONS TYPICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED 
IN CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES  
Table 23 - Exposure of special populations included or not in clinical trial development programmes  
Type of special population 
Exposure 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
Limited data were generated concerning use of teriflunomide in pregnant 
and lactating women, due to the contraception requirements during the 
clinical trials. 
In addition to the internal pharmacovigilance data (refer to [Part II SVII, 
Teratogenicity]), a publication with data cut-off Dec-2017 70 brings 
information regarding the pregnancies of women exposed to 
teriflunomide from clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting as well 
as their outcomes. 
In the context of Post-Authorization Pregnancy Registries OBS13499 (US 
and Canada) and OBS12751 (EU and ROW), a total of 60 pregnancies 
occurred in 60 female patients who received teriflunomide (either 7 mg 
or 14 mg).  
Type of special population 
Exposure 
Patients with relevant comorbidities 
•  Patients with hepatic impairment 
•  Patients with renal impairment 
Populations with relevant different ethnic 
origin 
Other 
•  Children and adolescents 
•  Elderly patients (>65 years) 
•  Pregnant partners of male patients 
•  Concomitant use with other MS treatments 
Patients with liver function impairment or persisting elevations of ALT, 
AST, or direct bilirubin greater than 1.5 x ULN were excluded from 
Phase 2/3 clinical studies. 
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (serum creatinine 
>133 μmol/L) were excluded from Phase 2/3 clinical studies. 
Enrollment in placebo-controlled studies within the teriflunomide group 
was mostly Caucasian. Non-Caucasian enrolled included: Asian/Oriental, 
Black, and “Other”. Detailed figures are provided in the exposure tables 
in [Part II SIII]. 
Multiple sclerosis is not infrequent in patients below 18 years of age. One 
hundred sixty six children and adolescents were included in the clinical 
studies performed to date. A placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study 
(EFC11759-TERIKIDS) assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability, 
and teriflunomide administered to pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age 
with relapsing MS, has been performed. The 166 patients randomized 
include 10 patients prepubertal (5 in the placebo and 5 in the 
teriflunomide group) and 26 patients under the age of 13 years old (10 in 
the placebo group and 16 in the teriflunomide group) at baseline.  
In the open-label period, all enrolled participants (100 participants in the 
teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 52 participants in the 
placebo/teriflunomide group) were included in the analysis populations. 
The mean age of the study participants at baseline was 14.6 years 
(range of 10 to 17 years). Overall, 25 participants (16.4%) were 
below 13 years of age. Ten participants (6.6%) were prepubertal (Tanner 
Stage I).  
The completed clinical study report for double-blind, and open-label 
periods for study EFC11759/TeriKids is available. Overall, the LSC and 
known risks (both identified and potential) are similar in the Adult 
(above 18 years old) and Pediatric population (from 10 to 17 years old). 
As is generally observed in MS clinical studies in order to ensure that 
relapsing forms of MS are targeted, no elderly patients (>65 years of age) 
were included in the teriflunomide clinical program. 
Overall, there were 157 cases reporting pregnancies in female partners 
of male patients exposed to teriflunomide (paternal exposure) during the 
course of phase 2, 3, or 4 monotherapy clinical trials or from 
postmarketing sources. 
Adjunct studies of teriflunomide were conducted: two with

Pregnant or breast feeding women: Due to the embryo fetal toxicity observed in animals and 
since MS is highly prevalent in young women and that some treated women are likely to become 
pregnant even with strong contraception recommendations, teratogenicity is considered as an 
important potential risk, and is described in detail in [Part II SVII]. 
Patients with hepatic impairment: The PKs of teriflunomide in mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment was evaluated in Study POP6507, and showed no impact on the PK of teriflunomide. 
No specific study was conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Product Labeling 
includes “severe hepatic impairment” as a contraindication.  
Patients with renal impairment: Severe renal impairment had no impact on the PK of 
teriflunomide after a single oral dose of teriflunomide at 14 mg (Study POP11432). Therefore, no 
dose adjustment is anticipated in patients with mild or moderate or severe not undergoing dialysis 
renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment undergoing dialysis were not evaluated. 
Therefore, teriflunomide is contraindicated in this population.  
Patients of different racial and/or ethnic origins: The population PK analysis identified race as a 
statistically significant covariate influencing teriflunomide PKs but leading to only small changes in 
predicted exposure in different races. The sample size was too small to draw any firm conclusions 
(Caucasians represented 96% of the analysis population), but Black, Asian, or other non-Caucasian 
race appears to have only small effects on PK parameters.  
Children and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of teriflunomide have been established through 
the EFC11759/TERIKIDS study in patients 10-year-old and older.  
• 
• 
In the completed double-blind period, ten (10) patients (6.6%) of the study population of 
Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS were reported to be in Tanner Stage I at baseline, indicating 
that they were pre-pubertal (5 patients in each group).  
In the completed open-label period, the mean age of the study participants at baseline 
was 14.6 years (range of 10 to 17 years). Overall, 25 participants (16.4%) were 
below 13 years of age. Ten (10) participants (6.6%) were prepubertal (Tanner Stage I). 
Therefore, safety data in pre-pubertal patients is still limited and this subpopulation should 
be closely monitored (via routine pharmacovigilance activities). 
Elderly patients (>65 years): Due to limited safety and efficacy data, teriflunomide should be used 
with caution in patients aged 65 years and over. 
Pregnant partners of male patients: Two (2) congenital anomalies were reported in partners of 
male patients treated with teriflunomide: a case of transient pes planus varus in a full-term female 
infant and a case of hip dysplasia in a full-term female infant. Both were assessed as unrelated to 
study drug. In EU, teriflunomide is not contraindicated in male patients. 
Concomitant use with other multiple sclerosis treatments: No new safety signal was observed in 
these teriflunomide adjunct studies as compared to the teriflunomide monotherapy studies. 
Concomitant use of teriflunomide with MS treatments (other than INF-β or GA) was considered as 
missing information till the EU-RMP version 7.0 and has been removed from the LSC in EU-RMP 
update version 7.2 onwards. 
Concomitant use in patients receiving vaccine: Immunomodulating agents such as teriflunomide 
may impact the efficacy and safety of vaccines. Two clinical studies have shown that vaccinations 
to inactivated neo-antigen (first vaccination), or recall antigen (re-exposure) were safe and effective 
during AUBAGIO treatment. The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and 
should therefore be avoided.

POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPOSURE  
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure  
Internal sales data have been used as the source for teriflunomide exposure data retrieval. Sales 
figures for cumulative exposure can be retrieved from 01 September 2012 to 31 August 2022. 
SV.1.2 
Exposure  
Teriflunomide was first approved in the US on 12 September 2012. The MAH made AUBAGIO 
available on the US market on 01 October 2012. 
In addition to the countries where teriflunomide is authorized, patients received commercial 
teriflunomide via an International Charitable Access Program (ICAP). 
Cumulative exposure was estimated at 229.97 million tablets, consisting of 224.29 million tablets of 
teriflunomide 14 mg and 5.68 million tablets of teriflunomide 7 mg. Based on the World Health 
Organization (WHO), defined daily dose of 14 mg, the patient exposure is estimated 
at 227.1 million patient days, corresponding to 621 859 patient years.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVI: ADDITIONAL EU 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
SVI.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes  
Teriflunomide possesses a unique mechanism of action for treating MS. Teriflunomide is shown to 
non competitively and reversibly inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme DHO DH required for 
de novo synthesis of pyrimidines. Blockade of DHO DH by teriflunomide is believed to result in 
diminished numbers of activated lymphocytes in peripheral blood, that are available to enter the 
CNS leading to reduction or halting of CNS damage in patients with MS. It may not be required for 
it to cross the blood brain barrier to produce anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in 
the CNS. 
An assessment of teriflunomide dependence and abuse potential was conducted based on the 
literature, chemistry, formulation, non-clinical and clinical data. 
The pharmacological profile of teriflunomide, as assessed by binding and/or inhibition assays, is not 
similar to any known drugs of abuse. No information on behavioral effects related to the abuse 
potential of teriflunomide or its parent compound leflunomide was found in the literature. As 
indicated by its Tanimoto index of below 0.19, the chemical structure of teriflunomide does not 
present significant similarities with the chemical structures of representative known drugs of abuse, 
ie, morphine derivatives, CNS stimulants, hallucinogenic compounds, benzodiazepines, 
cannabinoid or nicotine compounds. 
Available non-clinical data (safety pharmacology and toxicology) do not show any obvious drug 
dependence or abuse potential of teriflunomide. 
No cases of abuse, dependence, or diversion were reported with the use of teriflunomide in clinical 
development program and the analysis of clinical data did not reveal teriflunomide potential for 
abuse and dependence. For the review, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were grouped 
in 3 pre specified categories, “euphoria related events”, “subjective response event” and 
“dissociative/psychotic events”. Across all clinical studies, the vast majority of “euphoria related 
events” consisted of nonspecific dizziness with a similar incidence across all treatment groups. 
There were no reports of events suggestive of positive psychoactive effects of the drug. No case of 
abuse with teriflunomide has been reported in the medical literature. Review of case reports 
received in the postmarketing setting since International Birth Date (IBD) up to DLP did not 
indicate a new safety concern for potential misuse for illegal purposes. 
In the pediatric population studied in EFC11759/TERIKIDS study, there were no events suggestive 
of a confirmed psychoactive effect of the drug, similarly to the results in the adult population. 
In summary, teriflunomide demonstrated no signal of dependence and abuse potential after review 
of similarities to known drugs of abuse according to chemical structure, pharmacology and 
mechanism of action, non-clinical data, clinical trial data, and case reports from postmarketing 
experience.

NEW SAFETY CONCERNS AND RECLASSIFICATION WITH A SUBMISSION 
OF AN UPDATED RMP  
“Long-term safety in paediatric patients” has been removed from the RMP V8.1 with 
following justification: 
, the missing information 
The open-label period of study EFC11759/TERIKIDS has been completed and data on the 
long-term safety in children is now available and no longer considered missing information. 
Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study (duration 96 weeks), followed by an open-label period that 
could last up to 192 weeks from randomization to end of treatment. Cumulatively, open-label 
data for teriflunomide 14 mg of more than 96 weeks are available for 83 (62.9%) pediatric 
patients. The highest cumulative duration of open-label treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg 
was approximately 3.5 years for 12 patients. The TEAEs reported in the open-label period of 
study EFC11759, including frequency and severity, were found along expectations for 
teriflunomide in the double-blind period. No additional concerns or worsening of safety 
issues were reported during the open-label phase. An increased risk of pancreatic disorders in 
children as compared to adults had been identified during interim reports of the study (reports 
used in support of the line extension for AUBAGIO to include pediatric patients with 
relapsing remitting MS). However, this risk is considered sufficiently minimized by extensive 
wording in the product information and no further information on this risk was identified 
from the open-label period of study EFC11759/TERIKIDS.

SVII.3.1  Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks  
Exposure in adults: 
The following pools were defined, one (Pool A) focusing on the placebo-controlled segments 
of studies and the other (Pool B) focusing on the active treatment, including the core and the 
extension segment of the studies and Study EFC10891/TENERE, in the initial submission. 
The pool A1 was defined in the TOPIC variation (procedure EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0003). 
They are described below, with pool A1 and pool B being the reference in the following risk 
tables: 
Pool A (placebo-controlled) consist of data from the phase 2 study 2001 (Proof of Concept), 
and the phase 3 EFC6049/TEMSO study. Follow up period was of 9 months and 2 years, 
respectively. Pool B (active treatment) consists of data from 2001 + LTS6048 (extension of 
2001) and EFC6049/TEMSO + LTS60501 (extension of EFC6049/TEMSO). Average follow 
up is 6.3 years, 4.7 years, and 1.2 years, respectively. 
Pool A1 (placebo controlled) consist of data from the 4 completed phase 2/3 monotherapy 
studies: phase 2 study 2001 (proof of concept), and phase 3 studies EFC6049/TEMSO, 
EFC10531/TOWER, and EFC6260/TOPIC. Follow up was 9 months and 2 years for the 
study 2001 and TEMSO, respectively, and an average follow up of 1.5 years and 1.3 years for 
TOWER and TOPIC, respectively. 
1 Placebo period of main study excluded for placebo switch patients. 
 
In addition, when the analysis of elements of postmarketing Surveillance are confirming or 
amending the conclusions, a statement is added.  
Exposure in children: 
A summary of the extent of exposure to the IMP during the combined double-blind and 
open-label treatment periods is presented in Table 20. 
A total of 152 participants (100 participants in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group 
and 52 participants in the placebo/teriflunomide group) were treated in the open-label period 
of the study. The cumulative duration of treatment exposure (the sum of all participants’ 
duration of treatment exposure per treatment group) from enrollment to the open-label period 
was 36.18 participant-years for the teriflunomide 7 mg dose and 265.82 participant-years for 
the 14 mg dose (Table 21). 
Most of the participants (132 participants) received 14 mg teriflunomide. No participants 
received 3.5 mg in the open-label period. No difference in the duration of study treatment 
was noted between the 7 mg and 14 mg teriflunomide groups. 
The median duration of study treatment was 683.0 days for the teriflunomide 7 mg group 
and 680.0 days for the 14 mg group. Most of the participants received the IMP (62.5% in the 
7 mg group and 62.9% in the 14 mg group) for more than 96 weeks (Table 21).

Hepatic effects 
Potential mechanism 
No hepatoxicity was observed in non-clinical studies performed with teriflunomide.  
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterization of the 
risk 
Hepatic effects were observed with leflunomide clinically.  
Exploratory non-clinical studies have been performed with leflunomide and/or teriflunomide. 
Preliminary results suggest approximately 10-fold greater effects on mitochondrial function 
with leflunomide as compared to teriflunomide. However, no clear mechanism of 
hepatotoxicity has been identified at this time, including apoptosis, superoxide anion 
generation, or cytotoxicity in primary hepatocytes. Further exploratory studies are planned.

In Adults 
Pool A1 
As shown in Table 25a, based on laboratory data, the proportion of patients with mild 
transaminase increase (ALT≤3 ULN) was higher with both teriflunomide groups as compared 
to placebo, and without a dose-effect relationship observed. On the other hand, the incidence 
of patients with ALT elevations above 3 x ULN (3-5, 5-20 or >20 x ULN) was balanced across 
treatment groups. Among the 76 patients with ALT elevation >3 x ULN, complete return to 
normal (ALT<1 ULN or return to baseline) was recorded (on treatment or following treatment 
discontinuation) in most patients (69, 76 and 80% with placebo, teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, 
respectively).  
With respect to reported hepatic TEAEs, the proportion of patients with hepatic disorder 
TEAEs was higher in the teriflunomide treatment groups (19.8% and 21.5% in 
teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, respectively) compared to the placebo group (15.2%).

Identified Risk 
Hepatic effects 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent hepatic disorder (≥5% at PT level) was 
alanine aminotransferase increased. Overall, teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a 
manageable safety profile, consistent with the experience observed in the double-blind 
period. 
Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database 
Cases of hepatic effects reported in the postmarketing setting were reviewed. Cumulatively, 
from Sep-2012 IBD to DLP 12-Sep-2022. 
In summary for this review, it was noted that the majority of patients were female, and the 
mean age was 49 years old. Confounding factors such as pre-existing history of hepatic 
disorders or elevated hepatic enzymes were reported. Time to event onset was missing in 
most cases and when available, the majority of cases reported onset within six months of 
initiating teriflunomide. Case outcome was unknown in the majority of cases (40%); 31% 
were reported to be resolved or resolving; and 27% were not resolved. 
This risk is reviewed on a regular basis in MAH’s safety governance meetings and there was 
no change in the known hepatotoxicity profile. The cases were also reviewed to assess past 
medical history and current active disorder including hemangioma of liver, hepatic cancer, 
hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis (with or without alcoholism), hepatic cyst, hepatic failure, and 
abnormal hepatic function. 
The safety profile of teriflunomide regarding potential causes of hepatotoxicity remains similar 
to previous assessments and did not reveal any new or unexpected finding in the 
postmarketing setting. 
EU-PASS OBS12753 
In the PASS, in patients exposed to teriflunomide, the incidence rate of abnormal liver 
enzymes (>3 ULN) was 22.54 per 1000 person-years and the incidence rate of acute liver 
injuries was in 0.18 per 1000 person-years. These incidences were not different from 
incidences observed in other platform DMTs. 
Seriousness/outcomes

All clinical studies (includes but is not limited to Pool A1 and Pool B) 
In Pool A1 (the pool which composed the submitted EU SCS), serious hepatic disorders were 
reported with similar or lower frequency in teriflunomide groups compared to placebo group 
(see Table 25b).  
Pool  A1 
In Pool A1, the proportion of patients with hepatic disorder TEAEs was higher in the 
teriflunomide treatment groups (19.8% [207/1045]) and 21.5% [215/1002] on 
teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively) compared to the placebo group 
(15.2% [152/997]). The main PT contributor was ALT increased. 
The median time to onset of hepatic disorders was 168.5 days in the placebo 
group, 127 days in the 7 mg teriflunomide group, and 115 days in the 14 mg teriflunomide 
group. 
Treatment emergent adverse events showed a higher probability of events in both 
teriflunomide groups compared to placebo, mainly during the first 6 months. 
Corrective treatment was given to 1.8% of patients on placebo, 3.0% of patients on 
teriflunomide 7 mg, and 2.4% of patients on teriflunomide 14 mg. Recovery was reported 
in 112 of 152 patients on placebo, 152 of 207 patients on teriflunomide 7 mg, 
and 183 of 215 patients on teriflunomide 14 mg during the observation period in Pool A1. 
Most of the events were mild to moderate. Hepatic disorders were considered as severe 
in 2.3% of patients on placebo, 1.5% of patients on teriflunomide 7 mg, and 2.1% of patients 
on teriflunomide 14 mg.  
Identified Risk 
Hepatic effects 
The analysis of RR suggested an increased risk with both teriflunomide 7 mg 
(RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.57) and teriflunomide 14 mg (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.70) 
compared to placebo.  
Throughout the EU clinical program, a total of 8 patients (4 on placebo, 4 on teriflunomide) 
were identified with hepatic enzymes level in the Hy’s Law range (ALT >3 x ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 x ULN). All of these cases had plausible alternative explanation for the event.

 patient in the 
One additional clinically significant case of “toxic hepatitis” (with elevation of ALT up 
to 32.4 x ULN) requiring hospitalization was reported in a 
TEMSO Study. Normalization in transaminases occurred about 5 months after 
discontinuation. Although the etiology of the hepatic event remained unclear, a causal role of 
teriflunomide in this case is possible.  
In children (EFC 11759/TERIKIDS study) 
Two patients in the teriflunomide group experienced serious hepatic disorders: one had 
alanine aminotransferase increased, and one had increased transaminases. Both events 
were asymptomatic, did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuation, and recovered with 
normalization of hepatic enzyme levels. 
The 2 serious cases were graded as severe. The other events were of mild or moderate 
intensity.  
One patient in the teriflunomide group experienced hepatic disorders (persisting alanine 
aminotransferase increased), diagnosed as drug-induced liver injury, leading to treatment 
discontinuation. The patient recovered with ALT normalization after teriflunomide 
discontinuation (and accelerated elimination procedure). 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Incidence of condition 
There are no data in the literature on the incidence of liver injuries in the MS population. 
In the general population, the acute liver failures or injuries are uncommon, the incidence of 
drug-induced hepatic injuries ranges from 13.9 per 100 000 inhabitants 
to 23.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. 71 
Adult patients from placebo arms of clinical trials were at a greater than the 
expected 2.5% risk of presenting with an abnormal ALT. By year 1, 19% of patients 
increasing to 25% of patients at the end of year 2 had abnormal ALT. 72 
A meta-analysis reported a significant increase of 30% in the odds of alteration in any liver 
function test in patients receiving interferon B compared to teriflunomide 
(OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.14-2.12), However, no significant difference were reported for liver failure 
and ALT elevation comparing Interferon B and teriflunomide. 73 
Incidences of the above risk in patients under different treatment regimens during trials are: 
•  Dimethyl fumarate (Clinical trial): 47%-56% increase in ALT >1 ULN and 6% had ALT 
≥3 ULN, over 2 years. 74 
•  Glatiramer acetate (Clinical trial): 37% increase in ALT >1 ULN and 7% had ALT ≥3 ULN, 
over 2 years. 74 
•  Daclizumab HYP (Clinical trial): 47%-56% increase in ALT >1 ULN and 6% had ALT 
≥3 ULN, over 2 years. 75 Alemtuzumab (Clinical trial): Any liver toxicity in 4% patients 
over 2 years. 76,77 Mitoxantrone (retrospective review) 16% increased AST (grade > 
or = 1), over a median follow-up of 5 months. 78  
•  Oral fingolimod (clinical trial): 18.6% increase of any liver test and 6.9% to 8.4% had 
ALT≥3 ULN, over 2 years. 79  
•  Interferons (longitudinal retrospective review): 37.6% of patients developed de novo ALT 
elevations>ULN and 12.4% developed de novo ALT>2 ULN over 39 months. 80  
 
 
Identified Risk 
Hepatic effects 
•  Laquinimod (phase IIb clinical trial): increase of liver enzymes (ALT) in 23.4% in 
the 0.3 mg laquinimod group and 33.0% in the 0.6 mg laquinimod group, over 24 weeks. 
81 
•  Natalizumab (Phase III clinical trial): abnormal liver-function results in 5% of patients 
over 2 years. 82 
Overall, prevalence of liver disease ranged from 1.5% to 1.7%. 
In a survey of self-reported physical comorbidities in the NARCOMS 
participants, 1.5% reported having “liver disease”. 83  
In a survey validating a self-report questionnaire of comorbidities against medical 
records, 1.2% of patients reported liver disease and 1.7% of patients had liver disease 
according to medical record. 84 
Impact on individual patient  
Not applicable 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment had no impact on the PK of teriflunomide (POP6507). 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have been excluded from teriflunomide clinical trials. 
Other possible theoretical risk factors: concomitant treatment with hepatotoxic agents 
(including alcohol), viral infections (including viral hepatitis), gallbladder disease. 
Preventability  
The following can help prevent this risk:  
•  Assess laboratory liver function tests (including ALT, bilirubin) at baseline before initiating 
treatment (to detect pre-existing liver disease), and periodically thereafter during treatment. 
•  Contraindicate treatment in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
•  Exercise caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease  
•  Consider discontinuing treatment if liver enzyme increase (above 3 x ULN) is confirmed or 
if liver injury is suspected. 
•  Educate patient about signs and symptoms of liver injury, and to seek prompt medical 
attention if such signs/symptoms are present. 
The benefit-risk remains unchanged for teriflunomide.

Potential mechanism 
Unknown 
The analysis of vital signs showed no relevant change in heart rate in association 
with teriflunomide treatment, suggesting that blood pressure increases were not due 
to increased cardiac output or increased sympathetic activity. Significant 
vasoconstriction or changes in renal glomerular function which could have resulted in 
blood pressure elevation are not evident with teriflunomide; furthermore, there is no 
evidence for fluid retention.

Evaluation of blood pressure measurements showed that mean changes from 
baseline in SBP and DBP gradually increased over time with both treatment doses. A 
tendency to normalization of blood pressure with the cessation of study treatment 
was observed in the follow-up period. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline to endpoint value for SBP was 2.3 (13.8), 
2.7 (12.4), and -0.6 (12.7) mmHg for the 7 mg, 14 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The mean (SD) change from baseline to endpoint value for DBP was 
1.4 (10.1), 1.9 (9.9), and -0.3 (9.2) mmHg for the 7 mg, 14 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. 
The increases in mean SBP and DBP compared to placebo started early after 
treatment initiation and were sustained over time. 
Median time to onset of TEAEs potentially related to hypertension was 169 days on 
placebo, 251 days on teriflunomide 7 mg, and 203 days on teriflunomide 14 mg. 
Patients who developed hypertension on teriflunomide treatment were usually well 
controlled with the introduction of or modification of antihypertensive treatment. 
Pool B 
Additional reports of hypertension/blood pressure increased were observed during 
the long-term extension. These included 3 cases of non-serious hypertensive crisis in 
patients with an underlying history of hypertension (1 at 7 mg, and 2 at 14 mg). The 
3 patients recovered that same day with corrective treatment and continued the 
study. Overall, there was no clinical evidence for long-term complications due to 
hypertension. 
In children (EFC 11759/TERIKIDS study) 
No patient in the teriflunomide group and 1 patient (1.8%) in the placebo group 
experienced hypertension.

Cases of hypertension reported in the postmarketing setting at DLP 12-Sep-2022 
were reviewed and were found to be consistent with the known safety profile of 
teriflunomide. 
Seriousness/outcomes  
In adults 
Pool  A1: There were no reports of hypertensive emergency (eg, malignant 
hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy) and no other acute life-threatening 
complications secondary to increases in blood pressure. No increased risk of heart 
disease resulting from teriflunomide-induced hypertension became apparent during 
any study in Pool A1. Most of the TEAEs were mild in intensity. One event in the 
placebo group and 2 events in the teriflunomide 14 mg group were reported as 
severe in intensity. 
Pool B: During the long-term exposure, there were 3 cases reported as hypertensive 
crisis in patients with underlying history of hypertension (1 at 7 mg and 2 at 14 mg). 
All 3 events were non-serious, recovered with corrective treatment, and did not lead 
to treatment discontinuation.  
Patients who developed hypertension were usually well controlled with the 
introduction or modification of antihypertensive treatment. 
Three patients with a diagnosis of hypertension experienced a cardiovascular event, 
all at 7 mg (one fatal MI, one non-fatal MI and one arrhythmia).  
In children (EFC 11759/TERIKIDS study) 
No case of hypertension was reported in the study in the teriflunomide group.  
Background incidence/prevalence  
Incidence of condition 
There are no data in the literature on the incidence of hypertension in the MS 
population. In the general population, the incidence of hypertension is 32 per 1000 
person-years in Canada. 85 
Incidences of hypertension in patients reported from clinical trials showed a 
cumulative incidence of 6.3% in patients treated with fingolimod over the 24 months 
follow-up. 79 
 
Identified Risk 
Hypertension 
Persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for stroke, MI, heart failure and 
arterial aneurysm, and is a leading cause of chronic kidney failure. 86 
Among pediatric MS patients (ie, 10 to <18 years of age) the incidence rate of 
hypertension is 10.12/1000 person-years (95% CI = 4.83-21.24). The hypertension 
rate among age-, gender-, and calendar-year matched controls (non-MS patients) 
was 2.09/1000 person-years (95% CI = 0.29-14.82). 87 
Prevalence of condition 
In a survey of self-reported physical comorbidities in the NARCOMS participants, 
30.1% reported having hypertension. 83 A cross-sectional study form the USA 
reported age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalence of hypertension to be 
33.0% (95% CI: 33.0-33.0) among MS patients and 26.4% (95% CI: 26.3-26.4) 
among people without MS with prevalence ratio of 1.25 (95% CI: 1.25-1.25). 88 
In hospitalized MS patients age 65 or older, hypertension was the primary or 
secondary diagnosis for 5 out of every 100 discharges. 89 
Impact on individual patient  
Not applicable 
Patients with prior history of hypertension, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or 
receiving concomitant drugs causing hypertension (eg, NSAID, OC).  
Presence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, diabetes. 90 
There was no evidence of an increased risk of hypertension regarding intrinsic (age, 
gender, race, BMI and extrinsic (region, territory, previous disease modifying MS 
therapy, selected concomitant medications) factors. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability  
Risk is preventable by: 
•  Identifying patients with cardiovascular risk factors, pre-existing hypertension. 
•  Periodic monitoring of blood pressure during treatment. 
•  Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive treatment, as necessary.

The proportion of patients with CTCAE lymphocyte count decrease grade 
1 (≥0.8 Giga/L to <LLN) and grade 2 (≥0.5 Giga/L to <0.8 Giga/L) was higher on 
teriflunomide than on placebo. The proportion of patients with grade 3 (≥0.2 Giga/L to 
<0.5 Giga/L) lymphocyte count decrease was 0.6% of patients on placebo compared 
to 1.1% of patients on teriflunomide 7 mg and 2.0% of patients on teriflunomide

Seriousness/outcomes  
Neutrophils Pool A1 
Four cases of grade 4 neutropenia were reported in the 7 mg teriflunomide group 
and 2 cases were reported in the 14 mg teriflunomide group. No case of febrile 
neutropenia was reported, and there was no evidence of a link between WBC 
decrease and the occurrence of infections. Isolated cases of more significant 
decreases predominantly of WBC were observed. Many of them had accelerated 
resolution and most of the patients continued treatment.  
Pool A1 
Platelet count: Platelet count decreased was reported by 0.6% and 0.5% of the 
patients in the 7 mg and 14 mg teriflunomide groups, respectively, versus 
0.1% patient in the placebo group. Thrombocytopenia was reported by 0.6% of 
patients in each of the teriflunomide groups compared to 0.1% of patients in the 
placebo group. 
One case of significant thrombocytopenia, potentially related to an immune-mediated 
mechanism, was reported in the 14 mg teriflunomide group. A causal relationship 
with teriflunomide was considered possible. No other clinically significant 
complications to blood cytopenias were reported. 
Hemorrhages: Hemorrhages were considered as serious in 2 patients in the placebo 
group, 5 patients in the 7 mg teriflunomide group, and 7 patients in the 14 mg 
teriflunomide group. Three patients on teriflunomide 14 mg discontinued due to 
hemorrhages.  
Pool B 
Platelet count: No additional case of serious thrombocytopenia was observed in 
Pool B.  
Hemorrhages: 6 patients in teriflunomide 7 mg and 1 in teriflunomide 14 mg had 
serious TEAEs related to hemorrhages.

Background incidence/prevalence  
Incidence of condition 
A study conducted in the UK that compared 6932 MS patients with 68 256 non-MS 
patients reported a 25% increased risk of any infection in MS patients relative to 
non-MS patients (IRR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.21-1.29) and a 100% increase in the risk of 
serious (hospitalized) infections in patients with MS compared to non-MS patients 
(IRR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.84-2.17). 91 Similar results were observed in a US-based study 
that compared 7743 veterans with MS to 30 972 non-MS veterans and reported the 
nearly twice the incidence of serious infections in MS cohort compared to non-MS 
cohort (19.2/1000 person-years vs 10.3/1000 person-years). Furthermore, relative to 
non-MS population, having MS significantly increased the risk of fatal infection 
by 85% (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.15), serious respiratory infections 
by 85% (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.15), urinary tract infections 
by 344% (HR: 4.44; 95% CI: 3.59-5.51) and sepsis by 156% (HR: 2.56; 
95% CI: 1.08-3.15). 42 
In a Norwegian cohort, the crude mortality rate due to infections, mainly pulmonary 
and urinary tract infections is 1.73 per 1000 person-years 92 and the standardized 
mortality ratio of deaths due to infections is 9.75 in the MS population.  
There are no data in the literature on the incidence of platelet count decrease in the 
MS population. In the general population, the incidence of ITP was estimated 
to 3.3 per 100 000 adults/year. 93  
Incidence of infection in patients treated  
•  Cladribine: 48% of patients had infections over 96 weeks and 2.3% had herpes 
zoster. No relation was found between lymphocyte counts and herpes zoster. 94  
•  Natalizumab 79% of patients had infections over two years and 3.2% had serious 
infections. 82  
•  Dimethyl fumarate: 56% of patients had infections over 2 years. 74 
•  Glatiramer acetate: 50% of patients had infections over 2 years. 74 
•  Daclizumab HYP: 65% of patients had infections over 2 years and 4% had serious 
infections. 75  
•  Interferon-β1a: 45% to 57% of patients had infections over 2 years, 2% had 
serious infections and 2% had herpes infections. 75,76,77  
•  Alemtuzumab: 67% of patients had infections over 2 years and 16% had herpes 
infections. 76,77 
In treatment-naive relapsing MS patients, lymphopenia was reported to be present 
in 10.1% of the patients and 13.7% in controls. 95 
Incidences of white blood cell decrease were described in patients under different 
treatment regimens are: 
•  Mitoxantrone (retrospective review): 27% had reduced neutrophil count (grade≥1) 
and 18% had evident neutropenia over a median follow-up of 14 months. 78 
•  Fingolimod (clinical trial): 6.3% had leucopenia and 5.4% had lymphopenia over 
two years. 79 
•  Cladribine (clinical trial): 26.7% had lymphopenia, 7.1% had leucopenia and 
2.0% had neutropenia over 96 weeks. 94

•  Interferon-β1a: 16% to 23% had leucopenia and 14% to 17% had

Prevalence of condition 
In Maryland in the US, the age-adjusted prevalence rate of ITP was found to 
be 9.5 per 100 000 persons 97 and in patients with ITP the prevalence of MS was 
approximately 25 times the prevalence that would be expected in the general 
population. 98 
Impact on individual patient  
Not applicable 
Patients with pre-existent neutropenia, combination with other neutropenic or 
lymphopenic drug. 
Patients with pre-existent thrombocytopenia. Combination with other thrombopenic 
drugs or drugs increasing the bleeding risk. 
There was no evidence of increased risk of hematologic effects or hemorrhages in 
patients treated with teriflunomide 7 or 14 mg compared to those receiving placebo 
regarding intrinsic (age, gender, race, BMI, baseline EDSS) and extrinsic (region, 
territory, previous disease modifying MS therapy, selected concomitant medications) 
factors. 
Decrease in WBC, neutrophil and lymphocytes are monitorable with assessment of 
blood cell count, before initiating teriflunomide treatment, and periodically throughout 
teriflunomide treatment.  
Decrease in platelet count is monitorable with assessment of platelets count before 
initiating teriflunomide treatment, and periodically thereafter during treatment with 
teriflunomide, or in case of hemorrhages. 
The benefit-risk remains unchanged for teriflunomide.

compared with placebo. 
However, this did not translate into an increased risk of infection (TEAEs of

Postmarketing experience: Cumulatively since the IBD, the MAH has received a 
total of 24 unique case reports (including 22 events of sepsis, 1 wound sepsis 
and 1 urosepsis). All events were assessed as serious. Five patients died due to 
sepsis and one patient experienced life-threatening sepsis. Seventeen patients 
experienced sepsis that led to hospitalization and in 1 patient the sepsis was a 
medically important event.  
Eight patients recovered or were recovering from sepsis at the time of the report. 
The 5 patients who died due to sepsis (4 due to urinary tract infection and 
1 secondary to decubitus ulcers), all had advanced MS disease and multiple drug 
therapy. Sepsis is a known possible cause of death in patients with MS.  
Severity and nature of risk  
Pool A1 
Infections  
In Pool A1, as shown in Table 28a, infections were commonly reported (>50% in 
all 3 groups), with no observed imbalance among treatment groups. Infections 
were mainly of upper respiratory tract origin including nasopharyngitis. Infections 
leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 0.5%, 0.8%, and 1.0%, with 
placebo, teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, respectively.  
Serious infections and infestations TEAEs were observed in similar proportions of 
patients across the placebo and teriflunomide groups (2.2% on placebo, 2.2% on 
teriflunomide 7 mg, and 2.7% on teriflunomide 14 mg). 
Viral infections (in HLT Viral infections NEC) were reported with somewhat higher 
frequency in the teriflunomide 7 mg (5.3%) and 14 mg (4.8%) groups compared 
with placebo (3.5%), but with no clear trend in terms of a dose-effect relationship. 
The main PT contributors for viral infections in the 7 mg/14 mg teriflunomide 
treatment groups were viral gastroenteritis (1.7%/2.4%), viral infection (1.3%/0.9%) 
and respiratory tract viral infection (1.4%/0.7%).

Pool  B 
Infections: the proportion of patients with TEAEs related to infections and 
infestations was comparable across treatment groups (68.0% and 64.3% in the 
teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg groups, respectively). Few patients (0.4% and 
1.1% of patients with teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, respectively) discontinued 
treatment further to infection during the study period.  
See frequency with 95% CI. 
The update of the pool B data did not change the analysis provided above. 
In children (EFC11759/TERIKIDS Study) 
The proportion of patients with infections and infestations TEAEs was higher in the 
teriflunomide group (66.1%) than in the placebo group (45.6%) (Table 28b).  
The most frequently occurring infections TEAEs (≥5% at PT level in any treatment 
groups) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, and 
pharyngitis which were more frequently reported in the teriflunomide group, and 
gastroenteritis which was more frequently reported in the placebo group. No 
additional unexpected events were identified in the open-label period. Overall, 
teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile, consistent with 
the experience observed in the double-blind period.

Cases of infections reported in the postmarketing setting at DLP 12-Sep-2022 
were reviewed and were found to be consistent with the known safety profile of 
teriflunomide.  
EU-PASS OBS12753 
In the PASS, in patients exposed to teriflunomide, the incidence of serious 
infections was 4.77 per 1000 person-years, incidence of pneumonia ranged from 
2.77 to 4.38 per 1000 person-years. These incidences were not different from 
incidences observed in other platform DMTs. 
Seriousness/outcomes  
In adults 
Infections Pool  A1 
As shown in [Table 28c], a low and similar incidence of serious infections was 
reported (2.1%, 1.4%, and 2.2% with placebo, teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, 
respectively). No febrile neutropenia was reported.

Infections Pool  B 
The incidence of serious TEAEs of infections in Pool B was comparable between 
the 2 teriflunomide doses (27 patients [3.9%] and 22 patients [3.3%] with 
teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, respectively). The main contributor for serious TEAEs 
was urinary tract infections (3 and 4 patients for teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, 
respectively).  
Serious opportunistic infections for Pool B are discussed in Table 31. 
In children (EFC11759/TERIKIDS Study) 
Overall, 3 cases were serious: upper respiratory tract infection in one patient and 
pulmonary tuberculosis in another patient in the teriflunomide group and 
appendicitis in a patient from the placebo group. The case of upper respiratory 
tract infection related to a hospitalization for concomitant MS relapse, although it 
was not serious by itself. One infection led to treatment discontinuation (serious 
pulmonary tuberculosis). This patient was diagnosed at the occasion of a 
screening at school in the context of an epidemy of tuberculosis in China. The 
patient recovered from tuberculosis after IMP discontinuation and administration of 
anti-tuberculosis treatment. 
Background incidence/prevalence  
Incidence of condition 
A study conducted in the UK that compared 6932 MS patients with 68 256 non-MS 
patients reported a 25% increased risk of any infection in MS patients relative to 
non-MS patients (IRR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.21-1.29) and a 100% increase in the risk of 
serious (hospitalized) infections in patients with MS compared to non-MS patients 
(IRR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.84-2.17). 91 Similar results were observed in a US-based 
study that compared 7743 veterans with MS to 30 972 non-MS veterans and 
reported the nearly twice the incidence of serious infections in MS cohort 
compared to non-MS cohort (19.2/1000 person-years vs 10.3/1000 person-years). 
Furthermore, relative to non-MS population, having MS significantly increased the 
risk of fatal infection by 85% (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.15), serious respiratory 
infections by 85% (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.15), urinary track infections by 344% 
(HR: 4.44; 95% CI: 3.59- 5.51) and sepsis by 156% (HR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.08-3.15). 
42 
In a Norwegian cohort, the crude mortality rate due to infections, mainly pulmonary 
and urinary tract infections is 1.73 per 1000 person-years 92 and the standardized 
mortality ratio of deaths due to infections is 9.75 in the MS population.  
Incidence of infection in patients treated  
•  Cladribine: 48% of patients had infections over 96 weeks and 2.3% had herpes 
zoster. No relation was found between lymphocyte counts and herpes zoster. 94  
•  Natalizumab 79% of patients had infections over two years and 3.2% had 
serious infections. 82 
•  Dimethyl fumarate: 56% of patients had infections over 2 years. 74  
•  Glatiramer acetate: 50% of patients had infections over 2 years. 74 
•  Daclizumab HYP: 65% of patients had infections over 2 years and 4% had 
serious infections. 75 
•  Interferon-β1a: 45% to 57% of patients had infections over 2 years, 2% had 
serious infections and 2% had herpes infections. 75,76,77

Infections 
•  Alemtuzumab: 67% of patients had infections over 2 years and 16% had herpes

In treatment-naive relapsing MS patients, lymphopenia was reported to be present 
in 10.1% of the patients and 13.7% in controls. 95 
Incidences of WBC decrease described in patients under different treatment 
regimens: 
•  Mitoxantrone (retrospective review): 27% had reduced neutrophil count 
(grade ≥1) and 18% had evident neutropenia over a median follow-up of 
14 months. 78  
•  Fingolimod (clinical trial): 6.3% had leucopenia and 5.4% had lymphopenia 
over 2 years. 79 
•  Cladribine (clinical trial): 26.7% had lymphopenia, 7.1% had leucopenia and 
2.0% had neutropenia over 96 weeks. 94 
•  Interferon-β1a: 16% to 23% had leucopenia and 14% to 17% had 
granulocytopenia. 96 
Prevalence of condition 
Prevalence of neutropenia in general adult population ranged from 0.5% to 0.66%. 
99 In Maryland in the US, the age-adjusted prevalence rate of ITP was found to 
be 9.5 per 100 000 persons 97 and in patients with ITP the prevalence of MS was 
approximately 25 times the prevalence that would be expected in the general 
population. 98

used. This incidence was not different from incidence observed in other platform 
DMTs. 
Seriousness/outcomes  
In adults 
Pool A1 
The following Serious TEAEs were reported: in the placebo group: 2 pancreatitis, in 
the teriflunomide 7 mg group: 3 increased lipase and acute pancreatitis and in the 
teriflunomide 14 mg group: 2 increased lipase. In addition to these patients, 
2 patients in the 14 mg teriflunomide group discontinued the treatment due to 
pancreatic disorder TEAEs. 
Recovery during the observation period in Pool A1 was reported in 23 of 28 patients 
on placebo, 25 of 27 patients on teriflunomide 7 mg, and 25 of 27 patients on 
teriflunomide 14 mg. Pancreatic disorders were mainly asymptomatic, and 
pancreatic enzyme increases were reversible.  
In children (EFC11759/ TERIKIDS study) 
The observed safety profile in pediatric patients (from 10 to 17 years-old) receiving 
teriflunomide daily was overall similar to that seen in adult patients. However, in the 
pediatric study (166 patients: 109 in the teriflunomide group and 57 in the placebo 
group), cases of pancreatitis were reported in 1.8% (2/109) of the 
teriflunomide-treated patients compared to none in the placebo group, in the 
double-blind phase. One of these events led to hospitalization and required 
corrective treatment. In pediatric patients treated with teriflunomide in the 
open-label phase of the study, 2 additional cases of pancreatitis (one was reported 
as a serious event, the other was a non-serious event of mild intensity) and one 
case of serious acute pancreatitis (with pseudo-papilloma), were reported. In two of 
these 3 patients, pancreatitis led to hospitalization. Clinical symptoms included 
abdominal pain, nausea and/ or vomiting and serum amylase and lipase were 
elevated in these patients. All patients recovered after treatment discontinuation 
and accelerated elimination procedure (see section 4.4) and corrective treatment. 
Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database 
Acute pancreatitis has been reported infrequently in the postmarketing setting with 
teriflunomide in adults, including cases of necrotising pancreatitis and pancreatic 
pseudocyst which were not fatal. Pancreatic events (acute pancreatitis) may occur 
at any time during treatment with teriflunomide, which may lead to hospitalization 
and/or require corrective treatment. 
Background incidence/prevalence  
There is no epidemiological data of pancreatitis in MS population in the literature. 
Incidence of condition: 
A comprehensive epidemiological analysis of data from the Truven Market Scan 
Research Databases found that the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 
12.3/100 000 persons in children and 111.2/100 000 persons in non-elderly adults 
in 2014. 100 In a systematic review the global estimated incidence of acute 
pancreatitis was reported to be 33.7 cases (95% CI: 23.3 to 48.8) per 
100 000 population-years. 101 The same study reported estimated incidence rates 
of 58.2 per 100 000 population-years in the USA.  
For specific causes of acute pancreatitis, age standardized incidence rates 
were 5.4 per 100 000 for alcohol related and 5.7 per 100 000 for biliary tract 
disease related acute pancreatitis.  
Multiple sclerosis patients from 10 to <18 years of age have an acute pancreatitis 
incidence rate of 4.23 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 1.37-13.13). Note than in the

Severity and nature of risk  
In adults: 
This potential risk discussed in this table focuses on the fetal risk in women who 
enrolled in teriflunomide studies and became pregnant. (Note: Pregnancy in female 
partners of male patients is not considered as an important potential risk).  
Non-clinical studies conducted with teriflunomide showed embryofetal toxic effects 
in animals (rats and rabbits).  
All clinical studies in adults:  
A total of 76 pregnancies occurred in 76 female patients who received teriflunomide 
(either 7 mg or 14 mg) during the clinical development program. The pregnancy 
outcomes are as follows: 28 live births (which included 1 set of twins for a 
total 29 infants), 34 induced abortions (one of which was performed for an ectopic 
pregnancy), 12 spontaneous abortions, and 2 pregnancies with an unknown 
outcome as of the cut-off date (19-Apr-2019).  
In children (EFC11759/TERIKIDS Study)  
events were identified in the open-label period. Overall, teriflunomide was 
 No additional unexpected 
 
well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile, consistent with the experience 
observed in the double-blind period. 
Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database 
The GPV Database search retrieved 1501 case reports (from IBD to 12-Sep-2022) 
of patients who were exposed to teriflunomide during pregnancy in the 
post marketing setting. This includes clinical trial cases, postmarketing cases, and 
cases from non-interventional studies. Of the 1501 cases, 227 cases clearly did not 
concern pregnancy and thus will not be further discussed. 
Therefore, a total of 1274 cases of drug exposure via parent were retrieved. Of 
which, 30 pregnancies (considering a total exposure of 621 859 patient years as of 
DLP 12-Sep-2022) involved possible congenital malformations, for which causal 
relatedness was not established:  
Ventricular septal defect, polydactyly, fetal malformation, esophageal atresia, fetal 
malformation, congenital nose malformation, vascular malformation, fetal 
chromosome abnormality and fetal disorder and syndactyly, fetal cystic hygroma, 
eyelid ptosis congenital, ductus venosus agenesis, persistent left superior vena 
cava, cryptorchism, congenital flat feet, congenital pyelocaliectasis, fetal 
macrosomia, congenital arterial malformation, atrial septal defect, Marcus Gunn 
syndrome, atrial septal defect, amniotic cavity disorder, Talipes, ankyloglossia 
congenital, duodenal atresia, Congenital urethral anomaly, cystic lymphangioma, 
and congenital choroid plexus cyst.  
Other birth defects included esophageal disorder, intrauterine growth and 
development retardation, heartbeat abnormal neonatal, mild pleural effusion, 
strabismus, eye movement disorder, developmental delay or immaturity, cerebral 
ventricle dilatation (minor ventriculomegaly) and abnormal development of the 
fetus.  
Six (6) cases reported fetal death; in one case the fetus died due to circular cord, in 
the other case, the patient developed breast cancer. At 6 weeks, the fetus was not 
viable. In one case, the mother was exposed to teriflunomide during eight weeks of 
pregnancy, following which the accelerated elimination was done and unspecified 
duration afterwards, it was reported that the fetus died due to unspecified reason. In 
one case, spontaneous abortion leading to fetal death. In two cases, the fetus died 
due to many congenital anomalies.  
The GPV Database search retrieved 157 case reports (from IBD to 12-Sep-2022) of 
pregnant partner of male patients who were exposed to teriflunomide during 
pregnancy in the postmarketing setting, four pregnancies (considering a total 
exposure of 621 859 patient years as of DLP 12-Sep-2022) involved possible 
congenital malformations, for which causal relatedness was not established: 
Developmental hip dysplasia, Spine Malformation, congenital flat feet, Trisomy 21, 
and Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia. Exposed Pregnancies were early in the first 
trimester due to the accelerated elimination procedure done when the pregnancy 
was acknowledged. No specific pattern of defects was identified. The assessment 
of this risk did not reveal new or unexpected safety finding. The Product label 
indicates women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception to avoid 
pregnancy while taking teriflunomide. If teriflunomide is stopped, women should 
continue contraception until teriflunomide plasma concentrations have been 
checked to be equal to 0.02 μg/mL or lower. Women, who are planning a 
pregnancy or are pregnant, should be advised that an accelerated elimination 
procedure can be used to quickly decrease the plasma concentration of 
teriflunomide. Without the accelerated elimination procedure, on average it takes 
eight months to reach plasma concentrations less than or equal to 0.02 μg/mL; 
however due to individual variation in drug clearance it may take up to two years. 
The accelerated elimination could be used at any time after discontinuation of 
teriflunomide. 
Potential Risk 
Teratogenicity 
The evaluation of cases does not support an update of the characterization of this 
important potential risk. 
Seriousness/outcomes  
All delivered newborns to mothers treated with teriflunomide in clinical trials were 
healthy, except for a set of twins whose complications were attributed to 
prematurity. One of the twins presented with a major structural defect, 
ureteropyeloectasia (left sided). No other major structural or functional defects were 
observed in the Phase 3 clinical trials of teriflunomide. 100 
Background incidence/prevalence  
Incidence of condition 
Overall incidence of pregnancy outcomes in patients with MS exposed or not 
exposed to disease modifying agents are described in different studies and was 
shown to be similar to the one observed in general population: 
A prospective observational study from the teratology information service in 
Germany from 1996 to 2007 analyzed pregnancy outcomes in women with MS 
treated with IFN-β, GA or untreated and a healthy comparative group. Spontaneous 
abortion rates were in normal range for all groups except the small subgroup of 
IFN-β1b. There were two major birth defects in the GA group (club feet and

A prospective cohort of 60 Finnish women with MS becoming pregnant in 
2003-2005 there were no malformations or infant deaths. 104 
Dahl and associates analyzed more than 2 million births registered in the Medical 
Birth Registry of Norway from 01-Jan-1967 to 31-Dec-2002. They reported that the 
proportion of neonates with birth defects did not differ between mothers with and 
without MS. 105 
Another study analyzed data from the BERD, which was created by the Washington 
State Department of Health. This study reported that women with MS were no more 
likely to have infants with malformations (1.1% with MS compared with 
2.0% without MS). 106 
A retrospective study in MS centers in Argentina analyzed 141 pregnancies. 
Involuntary abortion was observed in 16% of pregnancies, and the rate of birth 
defects was 4.8%. 107

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Pregnant women and WOCBP including adolescents. 
Preventability  
Communication/Education Plan in women of child-bearing potential:  
•  Before treatment (investigate potential pregnancy and/or plan for pregnancy, 
emphasize need for contraception) 
•  During treatment (continue to reinforce need for effective contraception, assess 
potential pregnancy or pregnancy intention)  
•  If pregnancy occurs, need to alert physician immediately, assess benefit-risk, 
consider discontinuing treatment and performing accelerated elimination 
procedure, enroll in pregnancy registry.  
Accelerated elimination procedure allows to quickly decrease the levels of 
teriflunomide in the blood and quickly reach plasma levels of less than 0.02 μg/mL, 
which is considered a non-teratogenic risk level for teriflunomide in humans.

Pool B  
In Pool B, the number of patients with TEAEs related to opportunistic infections 
was 95 (13.6%) in teriflunomide 7 mg and 85 (12.9%) in teriflunomide 14 mg. These 
include but are not limited to: oral herpes, tinea pedis, and vulvovaginal mycotic 
infections. 
All clinical studies  
No case of PML was reported in the whole teriflunomide program.  
The main opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis, toxoplasma, syphilis, 
mucocutaneous candidiasis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis) did not occur in the 
teriflunomide studies. 
In children (EFC11759/TERIKIDS Study) 
One case of serious pulmonary tuberculosis was reported in the teriflunomide 
group. This patient was diagnosed in the context of an epidemy of tuberculosis. No 
additional unexpected events were identified in the open-label period. Overall, 
teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile, consistent with 
the experience observed in the double-blind period. 
Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database 
As of DLP 12-Sep-2022, the reported cases of serious opportunistic infection, with 
the administration of teriflunomide were consistent in nature and severity with the 
known safety profile of teriflunomide. No confirmed case of PML related to 
teriflunomide was retrieved from the GPV database. 
EU-PASS OBS12753 
In the PASS, in patients exposed to teriflunomide, the incidence of serious 
opportunistic infections in France was 0.36 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted 
HR was 2.4 (95% CI 1.2;4.8) compared to other platform DMTs without association 
to any pathogenic agent. In Belgium, in patients exposed to teriflunomide, incidence 
of patients receiving treatment for mycosis or tuberculosis was 2.80 and 8.92 per 
1000 patient-years, respectively. The adjusted HR for tuberculosis was 
1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6). No case of PML was observed in patients treated with 
teriflunomide in any study data source.  
Seriousness/outcomes  
In adults 
Pool A1  
Five serious TEAEs of opportunistic infections were reported: 2 in the placebo 
group (herpes zoster, hepatitis C and CMV infection), 1 in the 7 mg teriflunomide 
group (pulmonary tuberculosis), and 2 in the 14 mg teriflunomide group 
(tuberculosis gastrointestinal, acute hepatitis due to CMV). 
Potential Risk 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability  
Serious opportunistic infections, including PML 
Five patients had TEAEs related to opportunistic infections that led to study 
discontinuation: 2 patients had herpes zoster and 1 had tuberculosis in the 
teriflunomide 7 mg group and 1 patient each had tuberculosis and CMV in the 
teriflunomide 14 mg group. In Pool B, the following additional serious TEAEs of 
opportunistic infections were observed:  
Teriflunomide 7 mg 
(1 event) 
Teriflunomide 14 mg (1 event) 
Oral herpes (recovered in 
9 days) 
Suspected (unconfirmed) tuberculosis treated 
with a 6-month antituberculosis therapy  
No TEAE related to opportunistic infection, other than the CMV hepatitis described 
above, led to study discontinuation. 
In children (EFC11759/TERIKIDS Study) 
One opportunistic infection led to treatment discontinuation (serious pulmonary 
tuberculosis). The patient recovered from tuberculosis after IMP discontinuation and 
administration of anti-tuberculosis treatment.  
Background incidence/prevalence  
Incidence of condition 
The incidence of PML in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders is estimated to 
be 0.52% to 3.3%. 108 PML has also been seen in persons with autoimmune 
disorders (Systemic Lupus Erythematous, Rheumatoid arthritis, and nonspecific 
vasculitis). 109 
Incidence of PML is rare in MS patients. 
In patients treated with natalizumab: PML risk was 1 in 1133 for patients treated for 
more than 24 months. 109 
Prevalence of condition 
Opportunistic infections seen with use of immune modifying drugs for MS are likely 
to be similar to those seen with HIV infection and in organ and stem cell transplant 
patients, but knowledge is incomplete. A study conducted in 1984, prior to HIV 
infection, only 230 cases of PML were identified worldwide. With the AIDS 
pandemic, the prevalence increased dramatically because approximately 5% of all 
HIV-infected persons develop PML. 109 
Impact on individual patient  
Serious opportunistic infections, including PML, may be life-threatening, fatal, or 
may lead to disability. 
In patients with rituximab-associated PML, most cases developed in patients with 
underlying disorders known to predispose toward development of PML, chiefly 
lymphoproliferative disorders, patients with HIV infection and autoimmune 
disorders. 
With natalizumab, risk factors for PML include duration of treatment (number of 
natalizumab infusions) and prior use of immunosuppressive agents (eg, 
mitoxantrone, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate). 
Based on the immunomodulatory effect of teriflunomide, if a patient develops a 
serious infection, consider suspending treatment and reassess the benefits and 
risks prior to re-initiation of therapy.  
Accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or charcoal may be 
considered. Instruct patients receiving teriflunomide to report symptoms of 
 
Potential Risk 
Serious opportunistic infections, including PML 
infections to a physician. Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not 
start treatment with teriflunomide until the infection(s) is resolved. 
Impact on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product 
Public health impact 
The benefit-risk remains unchanged for teriflunomide. 
Not evaluated, however the potential for systemic severe opportunistic infections 
needs to be carefully monitored.

POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
III.1 
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
The safety profile of teriflunomide is continuously monitored since product launch, using routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
•  Routine pharmacovigilance practices allowing a comprehensive, continuous and global 
overview of postmarketing safety profile and signal detection.  
•  Periodic assessment in periodic safety update report (PSURs)/periodic benefit-risk 
evaluation report (PBRER) for spontaneous reports related to identified and potential risks.  
•  Continued analysis of safety in clinical trials.  
The following routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection are in place, including:  
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire for liver injury (Drug induced liver injury 
form) 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire for pancreatic effects (Pancreatic disorder 
form) 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire for teratogenicity (Pregnancy reporting 
form) 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire for serious opportunistic infections, 
including PML (PML form) 
III.2 
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
Additional pharmacovigilance activities in the postmarketing setting includes: 
•  Two pregnancy registries (OBS13499 and OBS12751) (see details in [Part VII Annex 3]) to 
monitor reports of use and/or AEs in pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes to better assess 
and characterize teratogenicity.  
•  A pediatric clinical study (EFC11759), as per agreed Pediatric Investigational Plan, to better 
assess and characterize the long-term safety profile of teriflunomide in children. The 
double-blind, and open-label periods are completed (see details [Part VII Annex 2]) and is 
thus proposed to be removed from the pharmacovigilance plan.  
•  The Metrics of the distribution of hard copy of educational materials to treating to assess the 
level of distribution of educational materials to the targeted audience have been reported in 
PBRER/PSUR. This measure is considered completed since November 2016 and has been 
submitted within the following procedure number: EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010135/201609. 
•  The summarized final results from the completed knowledge and understanding surveys of 
HCPs and patients to evaluate the effectiveness of additional risk minimization measures are 
provided in [Part V]. The studies are completed (see details in [Part VII Annex 2]). 
•  The summarized results from the completed non-interventional study PASS (OBS12753) to 
characterize the long-term safety profile of teriflunomide in adult patients with MS in a 
real-world setting and to determine the incidence of events of special interest, including 
hepatic effects, infections, ILD, acute pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, serious 
opportunistic infections, including PML, cardiovascular effects, renal failure, malignancies 
are provided in [Part II SVII]. The study is considered completed (see details 
[Part VII Annex 2]).

V.2  ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES  
The following additional risk minimization tools have been implemented: 
•  Healthcare professional (HCP) education/discussion guide available in hard copy and 
web-based (depending on agreement with National Competent Authority) to educate HCPs 
and to facilitate (at the time of initiation of prescription with teriflunomide) a conversation 
between the prescribing HCPs and the patient/legal representative around specific 
information pertaining to the following: 
-  Risk of hepatic effects 
-  Potential risk of teratogenicity 
-  Risk of hypertension 
-  Risk of hematologic effects 
-  Risk of infections/serious opportunistic infections 
It also includes the following keys elements:  
-  A reminder to provide the Patient Card to the patient/legal representative and to discuss 
its content regularly during each consultation at least annually during treatment. 
-  A reminder to tell WOCBP including adolescents/their parents-caregivers that 
teriflunomide is contraindicated in pregnant women and in WOCBP not using an 
effective contraception during and after treatment.  
-  A reminder to assess regularly the potential for pregnancy in female patients including 
patients below 18 years old. 
-  A reminder to tell female children and /or parents/caregivers of female children about 
the need to contact the prescribing physician once the female child under teriflunomide 
treatment experiences menses. Counselling should be provided to the new patients of 
childbearing potential about contraception and the potential risk to the fetus. 
-  Contact information of the national coordinator who is the key actor in the pregnancy 
registry to enroll patients.  
•  Patient education card will be given by the HCP to the patient/legal representative in hard 
copy at the time of treatment initiation of prescription and on an annual basis during the 
treatment (which the patient can keep, carry and share with other HCPs involved with their 
treatment). The HCP can download this card in countries, where available. The patient card 
helps the patient identify the following risks: 
-  Risk of hepatic effects 
-  Risk of teratogenicity 
-  Risk of hypertension  
-  Risk of hematologic effects 
-  Risk of infections/serious opportunistic infections 
It also includes the following keys elements:  
-  A reminder for both patients and all HCPs involved in their treatment that the patient is 
being treated with teriflunomide. 
- 
Information to educate the patient about signs/symptoms which could be indicative of 
risks and the need to report them to their HCP if these occur.  
-  Encouragement for the patients to read the PIL thoroughly. 
-  Advices in case of pregnancy. 
- 
In addition, in countries where the Patient Support Program (MS One to One) is 
available, patients have the option to access electronic information and opt for 
reminders.

•  To facilitate a conversation between the prescribing HCPs and the patient 
about the information regarding the above risks. 
•  To remind prescribing HCPs to provide the patient with a Patient Card 
regularly during each consultation at least annually during treatment, to be 
used as a tool to relay information to HCPs involved with their medical 
care (especially in case of medical emergencies and/or if new 
Doctors/HCPs are involved). 
•  To encourage prescribing HCPs to remind patients to tell their HCP if they 
experience any of the signs and symptoms discussed in the Patient 
Education Card. 
Audience: Prescribers (ideally MS Specialists, Physicians experienced in 
management of MS, Neurologists, pediatricians, neuro-pediatricians). 
Mechanism: Healthcare Professional education/discussion guide will be 
offered as a web-based tool (accessible and monitored via the product 
website) and a paper hard copy (tear-off sheet provided via direct mailing or

Rationale for the additional risk 
minimization activity 
by Sanofi Genzyme representatives, or downloadable and printable via the 
product website). Distribution of the materials is planned to be done post 
launch and then on an ad hoc basis. This specific approach will be tailored to 
the individual market to ensure optimum tool uptake and use. The HCP 
education/discussion guide will contain key information for the prescriber 
(ideally MS Specialist, Physicians experienced in the management of MS, 
Neurologists, specialized MS nurses) and HCPs to discuss with the patient 
and emphasize the need to thoroughly read the labeling information. 
Routine pharmacovigilance and the following completed surveys: 
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Analysis of distribution 
and use metrics of risk minimization tools. 
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Behavior and Knowledge 
Survey in HCP Population.  
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Behavior and Knowledge 
Survey in Treated Patient Population.  
Criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk minimization measures:  
•  Number and severity of cases of interest reported. 
•  Distribution: The MAH is tracking the distribution in the EU. It is noted that 
figures collected are underestimated as not including the downloads from 
websites leading to potentially multiple printings. 
•  Behavior and Knowledge in HCPs: Knowledge with >70% of correct 
responses. Behavior: no pre-defined threshold. 
•  Combined wave 1 and 2 effectiveness study results in HCPs:  
•  Overall results show adequate knowledge and behavior of the HCPs 
around contraindications identification of potential risks, contraception and 
pregnancy.  
•  It has to be mentioned that knowledge of the required liver function 
monitoring and the purpose/presence of the pregnancy registry was 
sub-optimal, which are considered as areas of interest/improvement. 
•  To improve the effectiveness of the HCP Guide, it is proposed to revise its 
content to increase the readability. 
•  Educational materials are overall effective in supporting HCP knowledge 
relating to the safe use of AUBAGIO. 
•  The name of the registry coordinator is added to the HCP guide to 
increase enrollment of patients in the pregnancy registries in countries 
where applicable. 
To remind both patients/legal representatives and healthcare providers 
involved in their treatment that the patient is being treated with teriflunomide, 
a drug which may cause hepatic effects; hypertension; hematologic effects; 
infections; teratogenicity; and serious opportunistic infections, including PML. 
To educate patient/legal representatives: 
•  To pay attention to certain signs and symptoms (which might be indicate 
of liver disease or infections), and if these occur, to promptly contact their 
doctor/HCP. 
•  To encourage the patients to thoroughly read the PIL or go to product 
website for comprehensive information on the benefit-risk of their 
treatment.  
•  To remind WOCBP including girls and their parents/caregivers that 
teriflunomide should not be used in pregnant women and to use an 
effective contraception during and after treatment. 
•  For WOCBP including girls and their parents/caregivers: to emphasize 
need for effective contraception during and after treatment with 
teriflunomide, and to stop teriflunomide and alert doctor immediately in 
case of pregnancy or if breastfeeding. 
•  To remind both patients and HCP about the accelerated elimination 
procedure. 
•  To remind WOCBP, that their doctor will provide counselling on the 
potential risks to the fetus and on the need for effective contraception. 
•  To remind parents/caregivers of girls to contact the prescribing physician 
when the girls experiences menses for the first time in order to get 
counselling about the potential risk to the fetus and the need for 
contraception. 
•  In case of pregnancy, to remind both patients and healthcare about the 
Pregnancy Registry (in countries where pregnancy registry is ongoing). 
•  To remind patients to show the Patient Education Card to Doctors/HCPs 
involved with their medical care (especially in case of medical emergencies 
and/or if new Doctors/HCPs are involved).  
•  To record the first date of prescription and the contact details of their 
prescriber (ideally MS Specialist, Physicians experienced in management 
of MS, Neurologists, specialized MS nurses). 
Target audience and planned 
distribution path 
Audience: Patients and their caregivers, HCPs 
Mechanisms: The following mechanisms are being proposed:  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the interventions and criteria for 
success 
•  The Patient Education Card would be a credit-card size folded card carried 
by the patient. 
•  The prescribing HCP (ideally MS Specialist, Physicians experienced in 
management of MS, Neurologists, specialized MS nurses) would be 
expected to fill-in their contact details and then give the card to the patient. 
•  Replacement Patient Education Cards could be provided to patients by the 
HCPs and could also be accessible to patient electronically. 
Routine pharmacovigilance and the following completed surveys: 
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Analysis of distribution 
and use metrics of risk minimization tools. 
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Behavior and Knowledge 
Survey in HCP Population. 
•  Effectiveness of Minimization Measures of RMP: Behavior and Knowledge 
Survey in Treated Patient Population. 
Criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk minimization measures: 
•  Number and severity of cases of interest reported. 
•  Distribution: The MAH is tracking the distribution in the EU. It is noted that 
figures collected are underestimated as not including the downloads from 
websites leading to potentially multiple printings. 
•  Behavior and Knowledge in HCPs: Knowledge with >80% of correct 
responses. Behavior: no pre-defined threshold. 
•  Behavior and Knowledge in patients: >70% of correct responses. 
•  Combined wave 1 and 2 effectiveness study results in patients: 
•  Overall, the results of the patient knowledge did not reach an acceptable 
level of correct responses, especially with respect to liver and infection 
symptoms. 
•  Knowledge of risks in case of a pregnancy and the procedures to follow 
was near or above satisfactory which also applies to blood monitoring. 
•  It has to be mentioned that results were influenced by the design of the 
study and the assumption of a certain level of prior medical knowledge. 
•  To improve the effectiveness of the patient card, the following actions 
have been proposed: 
-  Encourage patients to keep and refer to the materials as needed. 
-  Patient card has been revised to increase the readability. 
-  Emphasize the need for HCPs to go through the materials with patients 
repeatedly and at least annually. 
-  Reminding patients that the educational materials are available on the 
MS One to One web site.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for AUBAGIO (Teriflunomide) 
This is a summary of the RMP for AUBAGIO. The RMP details important risks of AUBAGIO how 
these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about AUBAGIO’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
AUBAGIO’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how AUBAGIO should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for AUBAGIO should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European public assessment report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of AUBAGIO’s 
RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
AUBAGIO is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older 
with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
teriflunomide as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of AUBAGIO’s benefits can be found in AUBAGIO’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/aubagio 
II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of AUBAGIO, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about AUBAGIO’s risks, are outlined in the next sections. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;  
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;  
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;  
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of AUBAGIO, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of AUBAGIO is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of AUBAGIO are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of AUBAGIO. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term 
use of the medicine);

ANNEX 6
DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES
                         
Approved key messages of the additional risk minimization measures 
1.  Physician educational material: 
  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
  Healthcare professional (HCP) education/discussion guide 
1.1 Healthcare professional education/discussion guide: 
The educational material for HCP includes the following key elements: 
  Healthcare professionals should discuss with their patients the specific safety concerns of 
AUBAGIO® detailed below including the tests and precautions needed for safe use, at first 
prescription, and regularly during treatment as follows: 
-  Risk of hepatic effects: 
o  Liver function tests are needed prior to the start of treatment and periodically 
during treatment. 
o  To educate the patient about the signs and symptoms of liver disease and the need

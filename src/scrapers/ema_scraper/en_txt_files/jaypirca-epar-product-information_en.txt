CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Jaypirca as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase 
(BTK) inhibitor. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Jaypirca therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies.

Posology 
The recommended dose is 200 mg pirtobrutinib once daily (QD). 
Jaypirca dosing should be interrupted until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline when the patient 
experiences the following event: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Grade 3 neutropenia with fever and/or infection 
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 7 days 
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
Grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicity 
Asymptomatic lymphocytosis is not regarded as an adverse reaction, and patients experiencing this 
event should continue taking Jaypirca. 
In the clinical study, adverse events in a limited number of patients were managed by dose reduction 
(see section 5.1). 
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed dose 
If more than 12 hours have passed after a patient has missed a dose, the patient should be instructed to 
take the next dose at its scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken. If vomiting occurs, the 
patient should not take an additional dose but continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.  There are 
no data in patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Jaypirca in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Jaypirca is for oral use. 
The tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water to ensure consistent performance (patients 
should not chew, crush, or split tablets before swallowing) and can be taken with or without food. 
Patients should take the dose at approximately the same time every day.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Infections 
Serious infections, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with Jaypirca. The most 
frequently reported Grade 3 or higher infections were pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19, 
and sepsis. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy should be considered in patients who are at increased 
risk for opportunistic infections. Based on the grade of infection and whether it occurs with 
neutropenia, dose interruption may be required (see section 4.2).  
Haemorrhage 
Bleeding events, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with Jaypirca, with and 
without thrombocytopenia. Major bleeding events of Grade 3 or higher, including gastrointestinal 
bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage have been observed. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of bleeding. Patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents may be at increased risk 
of haemorrhage. The risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy should be considered 
when co-administered with Jaypirca and consider additional monitoring for signs of bleeding. The use 
of Jaypirca has not been studied with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists. 
Dose interruption may be required for Grade 3 or 4 bleeding events (see section 4.2).  
The benefit-risk of withholding Jaypirca for 3 to 5 days pre- and post-surgery should be considered 
depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding.  
Cytopenias 
Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in patients 
treated with Jaypirca. Complete blood counts should be monitored in patients during treatment as 
medically indicated. Based on the grade of cytopenia, dose interruption may be required (see section 
4.2).  
Atrial fibrillation/ flutter 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been observed in patients treated with Jaypirca, particularly in 
patients with a history of atrial fibrillation and/or multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. Signs and 
symptoms of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter should be monitored in patients; obtain an 
electrocardiogram as medically indicated. Based on the grade of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, dose 
interruption may be required (see section 4.2).  
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have commonly occurred in patients treated with Jaypirca, with the most 
frequent types being non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients should be monitored for the appearance of 
skin cancers and advise protection from sun exposure. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported rarely with Jaypirca therapy. Patients at high risk of 
TLS are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Patients should be assessed for possible risk 
of TLS and closely monitored as clinically indicated. 
Contraception in women of childbearing potential and males 
Based on findings in animals and the genotoxicity of pirtobrutinib (see section 5.3), pirtobrutinib can 
cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should 
use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 5 weeks after the last dose of 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jaypirca. Men are advised to use an effective method of contraception and not father a child during 
treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of Jaypirca (see section 4.6). 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg daily dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pirtobrutinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of pirtobrutinib 
CYP3A inhibitors 
In a clinical study, itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the AUC of pirtobrutinib by 
48 % and did not change Cmax of pirtobrutinib. This increase in pirtobrutinib exposure is not clinically 
meaningful. Therefore, no dose adjustment of Jaypirca is necessary with CYP3A inhibitors.  
CYP3A inducers 
In a clinical study, rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased the AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 
71 %  and  42 %,  respectively.  Though  this  decrease  in  pirtobrutinib  exposure  is  not  expected  to  be 
clinically  meaningful,  if  possible  avoid  strong  CYP3A  inducers  (e.g.  rifampicin,  carbamazepine, 
phenytoin). 
Coadministration with medicinal products that are proton pump inhibitors 
No clinically significant differences in pirtobrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when 
administered concomitantly with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. 
Effects of pirtobrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (increase in plasma 
concentration) 
CYP2C8 substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of 
repaglinide (a substrate of CYP2C8) by 130 % and 98 %, respectively. Therefore, since pirtobrutinib 
can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP2C8 substrates, caution is advised when 
co-administering with CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide, dasabuvir, selexipag, rosiglitazone, 
pioglitazone, and montelukast).  
BCRP substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a moderate inhibitor of BCRP. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of 
rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) by 140 % and 146 %, respectively. Therefore, since pirtobrutinib can 
increase the plasma concentrations of BCRP substrates, caution is advised when co-administering 
BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin). If co-administration with narrow therapeutic index BCRP 
substrates (e.g. high dose methotrexate, mitoxantrone) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring 
should be considered. 
P-gp substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of digoxin (a P-gp 
substrate) by 35 % and 55 %, respectively. Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma 
concentrations of P-gp substrates. If co-administration with narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e.g dabigatran etexilate and digoxin) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be 
considered. 
CYP2C19 substrates 
Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of 
omeprazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) by 56 % and 49 %, respectively. Therefore, pirtobrutinib can 
increase the plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates. If co-administration with narrow 
therapeutic index CYP2C19 substrates (e.g phenobarbital and mephenytoin) cannot be avoided, close 
clinical monitoring should be considered. 
CYP3A substrates  
Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and Cmax of orally 
administered midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) by 70 % and 58 %, respectively. Pirtobrutinib 
did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of intravenously administered midazolam. 
Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates. If 
co-administration with narrow therapeutic index CYP3A substrates (e.g alfentanil, midazolam, 
tacrolimus) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
 Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in  males and females 
Based on findings in animals and the genotoxicity of pirtobrutinib (see section 5.3), pirtobrutinib can 
cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should 
use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 5 weeks after the last dose of 
Jaypirca. Men are advised to use an effective method of contraception and not father a child during 
treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of Jayprica (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Jaypirca in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Jaypirca should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pirtobrutinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Jaypirca and for one week after 
the last dose of Jaypirca.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of pirtobrutinib on human fertility.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Jaypirca has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Fatigue, dizziness, and 
asthenia have been reported in some patients during treatment with Jaypirca and should be considered 
when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 lists the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with Jaypirca used as a monotherapy from 
clinical study data. The ADRs are based on pooled data from 583 patients treated with Jaypirca 
monotherapy 200 mg QD starting dose with no dose escalation in a phase 1/2 clinical study. Patients 
were treated for MCL, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 
other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients were exposed to Jaypirca for a median duration of 
8 months. ADRs are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class. Frequency groups are defined 
by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000), and not known (cannot 
be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order 
of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No maximum tolerated dose was reached in the phase 1 study in which patients received repeated 
doses up to 300 mg once daily. In healthy volunteer studies, no dose related toxicity was observed 
when a maximum single dose of 900 mg was administered. Signs and symptoms of pirtobrutinib 
overdose have not been established and there is no specific treatment for pirtobrutinib overdose.  
For patients who experience overdose, closely monitor and provide appropriate supportive treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: not yet 
assigned  
Mechanism of action 
Pirtobrutinib is a reversible, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK is a signalling protein of the B-cell 
antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in 
activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. 
Pirtobrutinib binds to wild type BTK as well as BTK harboring C481 mutations leading to inhibition 
of BTK kinase activity.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of a single 900 mg dose of pirtobrutinib on the corrected QT (QTc) interval was evaluated 
in a study with placebo and positive controls in 30 healthy subjects. The selected dose is equivalent to 
approximately 2 times higher than the concentrations achieved at steady state at the recommended 
dosage of 200 mg once daily. Pirtobrutinib had no clinically meaningful effect on the change in QT 
corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) interval (i.e., > 10 ms) and there was no 
relationship between pirtobrutinib exposure and change in QTc interval.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Jaypirca was evaluated in adult patients with MCL in a phase 1/2 multicenter, open 
label, single arm clinical study: Study 18001 (BRUIN). The study included two parts: a phase 1 dose 
escalation, in which the dose range of monotherapy pirtobrutinib of 25 mg to 300 mg once daily was 
investigated, and a phase 2 dose expansion. The primary objective of the phase 1 portion was to 
determine the recommended phase 2 dose of pirtobrutinib, which was found to be 200 mg once daily, 
with a maximum tolerated dose not being established. The primary objective of the phase 2 part was to 
assess the anti-tumor activity of pirtobrutinib based on overall response rate as assessed by an 
independent review committee. Patients received Jaypirca orally daily until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Study 18001 enrolled and treated a total of 164 patients with a diagnosis of MCL and the primary 
analysis set (PAS) for the assessment of efficacy was based on the first 90 patients with MCL enrolled 
who had no known central nervous system (CNS) involvement, were treated with a prior BTK 
inhibitor, had received one or more doses of Jaypirca and had at least 1 site of radiographically 
assessable disease. The median age was 70 years (range: 46 to 87 years), 80 % were male, 84.4 % 
were White, 67.8 % had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
of 0 and 31.1 % had ECOG performance status of 1. Patients had a median number of 3 prior lines of 
therapy (range: 1 to 8), with the reason for discontinuation from the most recent prior BTK inhibitor 
therapy being progression in 81.1 % of patients and intolerance in 13.3 % of patients. 95.6 % of 
patients received prior anti-CD20 therapy, 87.8 % chemotherapy, 18.9 % autologous stem cell 
transplantation, 4.4 % allogenic stem cell transplantation, 15.6 % prior BCL2 inhibitor and 4.4 % 
received prior chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T) therapy. 38.9 % patients had 
extranodal involvement and 26.7 % had tumour bulk greater than or equal to 5 cm. The simplified 
MCL International Prognostic Index (sMIPI) score was low in 22.2 %, intermediate in 55.6 % and 
high in 22.2 % of patients.  
Of the 164 patients with MCL enrolled in Study 18001, 9 patients had a dose reduction, including 
6 responders that were able to remain on therapy and maintain a durable response following dose 
reductions to 150 mg QD (3), 100 mg QD (2), and 50 mg QD (1). 
The efficacy of Jaypirca was based on a response as assessed using 2014 Lugano criteria for malignant 
lymphoma. Efficacy results for patients that received at least one prior BTK inhibitor and included in 
the PAS are summarised in Table 2. For the 90 patients in the PAS, 79 received at least 1 dose of 
200 mg QD. Of these 79 patients, 77 started at 200 mg QD, 1 dose escalated from a lower dose and 
1 dose reduced from a higher dose. The median time on treatment was 5.24 months (range: 0.2 to 
39.6 months). Among the 51 responders, the median time to response was 1.84 months (range: 1.0 to 
7.5 months).  
While subgroup analyses represent a limited number of patients, clinically meaningful efficacy results 
were observed across important subgroups, including patients that discontinued prior BTK inhibitor 
therapy due to intolerance or progression and irrespective of number and type of prior therapies.

Jaypirca in all subsets of the paediatric population in mature B-cell malignancies (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).  
Conditional approval  
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of pirtobrutinib were characterized in healthy subjects and in patients with 
cancer. Doses ranged from 25 mg to 300 mg once daily (0.125 to 1.5 times the recommended dosage 
of 200 mg once daily), up to single doses of 900 mg. Increases in plasma exposure were 
approximately dose proportional. Steady state was achieved within 5 days of once daily dosing, and in 
cancer patients the mean [coefficient of variation (CV %)] accumulation ratio after administration of 
200 mg once daily was 1.63 (26.7 %) based on AUC. Three patient factors were attributed to changes 
in pirtobrutinib PK: body weight, serum albumin, and absolute eGFR. An increase in body weight 
from 70 kg to 120 kg is predicted to increase pirtobrutinib clearance by 24 %; a decrease in absolute 
eGFR from 90 mL/min to 30 mL/min is predicted to reduce pirtobrutinib clearance by 16 %; and a 
decrease in serum albumin from 40 g/L to 30 g/L is predicted to increase pirtobrutinib clearance by 
21 %. These factors alone are unlikely to  result in meaningful changes to pirtobrutinib PK and no 
dose adjustments are recommended. 
The mean (CV %) steady-state AUC and Cmax were 91 100 h*ng/mL (41 %) and 6 480 ng/mL (26 %), 
respectively, at the recommended dosage of 200 mg once daily in cancer patients.  
At the recommended dosage, pirtobrutinib achieves pharmacokinetic exposures that can exceed the 
BTK IC96 at trough and thus deliver tonic BTK target inhibition throughout the once daily dosing 
period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of pirtobrutinib after a single oral 200 mg dose is 85.5 % in healthy 
subjects. The median time to reach peak plasma concentration (tmax) is approximately 2 hours in both 
cancer patients and healthy subjects. There is no pH dependency for absorption. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of food 
A high-fat, high-calorie meal administered to healthy subjects decreased the Cmax of pirtobrutinib by 
23 % and delayed tmax by 1 hour. There was no effect on pirtobrutinib AUC. Pirtobrutinib can be taken 
with or without food. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent central volume of distribution of pirtobrutinib is 29.0 L in cancer patients. The 
plasma protein binding is 96 % and was independent of concentration between 0.5 and 50 µM. In 
plasma from healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment the protein binding was 96 %. 
Mean blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.79. 
Biotransformation 
Hepatic metabolism is the main route of clearance for pirtobrutinib. Pirtobrutinib is metabolised to 
several inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, UGT1A8 and UGT1A9. There was no clinically meaningful 
impact of CYP3A modulation on pirtobrutinib exposures.  
Pirtobrutinib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in vitro and minimally inhibits CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 at 60 µM. In vitro pirtobrutinib induces CYP3A4, CYP3A5, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2B6.  
Pirtobrutinib minimally inhibits UGT1A1 in vitro with an IC50 = 18 µM. 
Co-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors  
In vitro studies indicated that pirtobrutinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. 
Pirtobrutinib is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Pirtobrutinib affected the PK of digoxin, a P-
gp substrate, and rosuvastatin, a BCRP substrate, in clinical studies (see section 4.5).  
Elimination 
The mean apparent clearance of pirtobrutinib is 2.04 L/h with an effective half-life of approximately 
19 hours. Following a single radiolabeled dose of pirtobrutinib 200 mg to healthy subjects, 37 % of the 
dose was recovered in faeces (18 % unchanged) and 57 % in urine (10 % unchanged). 
Special populations 
Age, gender, race and body weight 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with cancer, age (range 27-95 years), race, 
gender, and body weight (range 35.7-152.5 kg) had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of 
pirtobrutinib. 
Renal impairment 
In a population PK analysis of cancer patients, patients with mild (eGFR 60 to < 90 ml/min) or 
moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 ml/min), pirtobrutinib clearance was 16 % to 27 % lower 
compared to clearance in patients with normal renal function, resulting in expected exposure of 
AUC = 94 100 ng*h/mL and Cmax = 6 680 ng/mL in patients with mild renal impairment (16-19 % 
higher compared to patients with normal renal function) and AUC = 108 000 ng*h/mL and 
Cmax = 7 360 ng/mL in patients with moderate renal impairment (28 to 36 % higher compared to 
patients with normal renal function). 
In a clinical pharmacology study of otherwise healthy volunteers, apparent clearance was 35 % lower 
in four participants with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to < 30 ml/min) compared to 
eight participants with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min), resulting in exposures of 
AUC0-inf = 115 000 ng*h/mL and Cmax = 2 980 ng/mL (62 % higher and 7 % lower, respectively, 
compared to normal renal function).  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis were not studied (see section 4.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
There were no clinically significant differences in the PK of pirtobrutinib for any degree of hepatic 
impairment (by Child-Pugh A, B, and C or any total bilirubin and any AST). In a dedicated hepatic 
impairment study mean AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib were similar between subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) the AUC was 15 % lower compared to normal hepatic 
function and the Cmax was similar. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) the 
AUC of pirtobrutinib was 21 % lower and mean Cmax was 24 % lower compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. The fraction unbound (fu) for pirtobrutinib in subjects generally increased as 
the severity of hepatic impairment increased. Therefore, after correcting pirtobrutinib PK exposure 
parameters with fu, there was no clinically significant difference observed in the unbound pirtobrutinib 
PK exposure parameters (AUCu and Cmax,u) between subjects with any degree of hepatic impairment 
and normal hepatic function. 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with pirtobrutinib in patients under 18 years of age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
In the repeat-dose studies decreased T-cell dependent antibody response in rats (at 0.69-fold human 
exposure at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC) and minimal to mild corneal lesions in 
dogs (at 0.42-fold human exposure) were observed. 
Genotoxicity / Carcinogenicity 
Pirtobrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay. Pirtobrutinib was aneugenic 
in two in vitro micronucleus assays using human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Pirtobrutinib had no 
effect in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay at doses up to 2 000 mg/kg (single dose), 
which is approximately 11-fold higher exposure (considering unbound Cmax value in female animals) 
than human exposure at 200 mg. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with pirtobrutinib. 
Embryotoxicity/ Teratogenicity 
In animal reproduction studies, administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis 
resulted in decreased foetal weight, embryo-foetal mortality, and foetal malformations at maternal 
exposures 3.0-fold human exposure at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC.  
Reproduction toxicity 
No fertility studies have been conducted with pirtobrutinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 
3 months duration, pirtobrutinib had no effect on male reproductive organs at 0.69-fold and 0.42-fold 
human exposure in rats and dogs, respectively, at the recommended dose of 200 mg based on AUC. 
Pirtobrutinib had no effect on female reproductive organs at 4.0-fold and 0.42-fold human exposure in 
rats and dogs, respectively.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Jaypirca is and what it is used for 
Jaypirca is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance pirtobrutinib. It belongs to a class of 
medicines called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.  
It is used on its own (monotherapy) to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adult patients who have 
been previously treated with another BTK inhibitor. MCL is an aggressive (fast growing) cancer of a 
type of white blood cell called B-cells. B-cells are part of the immune system (the body’s natural 
defences). This medicine is used when the cancer has come back (relapsed), or treatment has not 
worked (refractory).  
How Jaypirca works 
In MCL, Jaypirca works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps MCL cells grow and 
survive. By blocking BTK, Jaypirca helps to kill these cells and can reduce their number, which can 
slow down the worsening of the cancer.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Jaypirca  
Do not take Jaypirca  
- 
If you are allergic to pirtobrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jaypirca: 
• 
If you have an infection or are at an increased risk of developing an opportunistic infection 
(infections seen in patients with a weakened immune system). Your doctor may give you 
medicines to treat or prevent infections. 
If you have or ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements 
that could increase your risk of bleeding. See section “Other medicines and Jaypirca” below. 
If you recently had low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), neutrophils (a type of white blood 
cell that fights infections) or platelets (components that help the blood to clot) . 
If you have recently had any surgery or are planning to have surgery. Your doctor may ask you 
to stop taking Jaypirca for a short time (3 to 5 days) before and after your surgery. 
If you have or ever had an irregular heartbeat or have other heart and/or blood vessel problems, 
such as high blood pressure, history of a heart attack or have heart valve damage. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
You may get infections during treatment with Jaypirca. Contact your doctor if you have fever, chills, 
weakness, confusion, body aches, cough, cold or flu symptoms, feel tired, feel short of breath, have 
pain or burning feeling when passing urine. These could be signs of an infection.  
Talk to your doctor if you develop a new lesion or any change in the appearance of an area on the skin, 
as treatment with Jaypirca may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Use sun protection and 
make regular skin examinations.  
Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells, known as 
tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), have been reported rarely during treatment with Jaypirca. This may lead 
to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another healthcare  
professional may do blood tests to check for TLS. 
Your doctor will monitor you for the signs and symptoms of bleeding (see section 4) and check your 
blood cell counts as needed during treatment. 
Your doctor may monitor your heart rhythm for any irregularities throughout treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Jaypirca to children and adolescents aged less than 18 years. This is because it has not 
been studied in this age group.  
Other medicines and Jaypirca 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Jaypirca may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes medicines such as: 
• 
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen 
and naproxen, 
anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin and other medicines for treating or preventing blood 
clots, 
supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed. 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Jaypirca. 
• 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines as Jaypirca may affect how 
well these medicines work: 
• 
• 
• 
Repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone (used to treat diabetes) 
Dasabuvir (used for Hepatitis C infection) 
Selexipag (used to treat a type of high blood pressure in the lungs called pulmonary arterial 
hypertension) 
Rosuvastatin (a statin, a type of medicine to treat high cholesterol) 
Montelukast (used to treat asthma)  
Digoxin (used to treat heart disorders) 
Dabigatran etexilate (an anticoagulant, a type of medicine used to prevent blood clots) 
Phenobarbital (a barbiturate, a type of medicine used to treat seizures) 
Mephenytoin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (a type of medicine used to treat seizures) 
Midazolam (sedative),  
Alfentanil (medicine used for anesthesia) 
Tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection and skin conditions) 
Rifampicin (antibiotic) 
Methotrexate (medicine used to treat other cancers or immune system disorders)

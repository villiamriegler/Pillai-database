3.2.  Active substance – Raxtozinameran (XBB.1.5) 
3.2.1.  General information (CTD module 3.2.S.1) 
Section 3.2.S.1 has been updated with information related to the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant. The RNA 
nucleotide Sequence of the Omicron (XBB.1.5) active substance is included.  The information provided 
is considered adequate and acceptable. 
3.2.2.  Manufacture (CTD module 3.2.S.2) 
3.2.2.1.  Manufacturer(s) (CTD section: S.2.1) 
All proposed active substance manufacturing and testing sites are already approved in the existing 
Comirnaty conditional marketing authorisation (EU/1/20/1528/001-017) for the manufacture of the 
active substances tozinameran (Original), riltozinameran (Omicron BA.1) and famtozinameran 
(Omicron BA.4-5). The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed. 
3.2.2.2.  Description of manufacturing process and process controls (CTD section: S.2.2) 
 The manufacturing process and process controls are the same as currently approved for the 
manufacture of tozinameran, riltozinameran and famtozinameran.

3.2.2.3.  Control of materials (CTD section: S.2.3) 
Manufacture of the BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 active substance is achieved using in vitro 
transcription that includes a linear DNA template as a starting material. The linear DNA template is 
produced via plasmid DNA from transformed Escherichia coli cells. The plasmid, , is designed for the 
production of Omicron XBB.1.5 variant. This plasmid was generated using a combination of gene 
synthesis and recombinant DNA technology. The antigen-encoding sequence was generated by gene 
synthesis and cloned into the vector. The plasmid) used in the manufacture of the original vaccine was 
generated using the same procedure. The nucleotide differences between Omicron XBB.1.5 and 
(Original) are all located within the gene encoding the spike sequence. 
The plasmid map of Omicron XBB.1.5 was provided. 
BNT162b2 Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant vaccine active substance is manufactured by in vitro 
transcription using a linear DNA template, produced via plasmid DNA () from transformed Escherichia 
coli cells. The functional elements of the Omicron XBB.1.5 are sufficiently described in graphic and 
tabular formats and the sequence is included.  The information provided on the source and generation 
of the Omicron XBB.1.5 plasmid is considered sufficient, as the plasmid used in the manufacture of the 
original vaccine was generated using the same procedure, included in the original dossier, and as the 
nucleotide differences between Omicron XBB.1.5 and Original are located only within the gene 
encoding the spike sequence. 
The sites involved in manufacturing, testing and storage of the plasmids are listed.  
The master cell bank involved in the plasmid manufacturing process is described. MCB qualification 
tests are listed and include morphologic and genotypic identity, DNA sequencing, absence of 
contaminating bacteriophages and viability. Relevant specifications are set and data from the current 
MCB are provided. Restriction map analysis, plasmid retention and plasmid copy number are included 
The approach is endorsed.  
The plasmid MCB is enrolled in a cell bank stability program consisting of viability and plasmid 
retention assays conducted at all stability time points. The strategy is considered adequate. 
A single-tier cell banking system consisting of only a MCB is proposed for the plasmid cell bank: As 
relatively few vials of the plasmid MCB are needed to prepare the desired quantity of XBB.1.5 plasmid 
and Omicron strain changes are expected in the future, the MCB inventory is expected to last for the 
lifetime of the product. The approach is acceptable. 
Omicron XBB.1.5 plasmid is manufactured by a fed-batch fermentation process initiated from the 
bacterial master cell bank, identical to the process described in the original dossier. 
Specifications for the circular plasmid DNA as well as for the DNA linear template are provided. 
Process- and product-related impurities including host cell genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, 
bioburden and plasmid isoforms, for the plasmid DNA, are quantified routinely. Results from 
commercial-scale confirmatory batch are provided for the circular and linearized plasmid. All analytical 
methods used for the control of the linear DNA template obtained from Omicron XBB.1.5 plasmid are 
identical to the already provided methods used for testing of the DNA template except for the identity 
by restriction mapping and identity of the transgene region which is tested using a DNA Sanger 
sequencing method. These methods were updated to include Omicron XBB.1.5-specific reagents and 
sufficient descriptions and summary of the validation exercises are included.  
A shelf life based on the data collected and on-going stability studies that have been initiated for the 
original circular plasmid DNA and linear DNA template. Stability data are not yet available for the 
specific Omicron XBB.1.5 variant. However, considering that no changes are included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/417361/2023 
Page 8/21 
 
 
 
 
manufacturing process of the DNA template as compared to the original variant, the shelf-life is 
considered sufficiently supported by the original data. 
3.2.2.4.  Control of critical steps and intermediates (CTD section: S.2.4) 
The control of critical steps and intermediates are the same as currently approved for the manufacture 
of tozinameran, riltozinameran and famtozinameran. 
3.2.2.5.  Process validation and/or evaluation (CTD section: S.2.5) 
For process validation of the Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant the MAH refers to data on the original version 
of the active substance. This can be accepted since the manufacturing process is identical to that used 
for the original variant. 
3.2.2.6.  Manufacturing process development (CTD section: S.2.6) 
Section 3.2.S.2.6 has been updated with a document describing manufacturing process history for the 
Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant.  
The MAH states that since the manufacturing process is identical to that used for the original variant 
and the constructs are similar, the cause and effect and the FMEA risk assessment apply to both 
constructs. This is agreed to. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been defined and in-process test for monitoring (IPT-M) and 
for control (IPT-C) are presented for the Omicron (XBB.1.5) active substance manufacturing process. 
The CPPs, IPT-Cs and IPT-Ms are the same as those defined for the approved variants and the 
acceptance criteria are in almost all cases the same as for the approved variants. This is found 
acceptable. 
The MAH refers to that the Omicron (XBB.1.5) active substance leverages the platform manufacturing 
process and control strategy established for BNT162b2, assuring comparable variant drug substance 
across manufacturing sites. This is found acceptable. 
3.2.3.  Characterisation (CTD module 3.2.S.3) 
The MAH has provided characterisation data for the Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant active substance. The 
package includes confirmation of primary structure, poly(A)tail, 5’-Cap structure, higher order 
structure and biological activity. Essentially, the same methods as those used for characterisation of 
the original variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529) and Omicron (BA.4/BA.5) have been applied. As compared to 
the characterisation of Omicron (B.1.1.529) and Omicron (BA.4/BA.5), an orthogonal test to 
characterise primary structure and an orthogonal test to confirm the presence and determine the 
length of the poly(A) tail is added. Both methods have, however, been used for characterisation of the 
original variants. The results for primary structure, 5’-Cap structure, poly(A)tail, and higher order 
structure are found acceptable, sufficiently supporting the expected characteristics of the Omicron 
(BA.4/BA.5) variant. 
Biological activity is confirmed by cell-free in vitro translation and western blot analysis. A band 
corresponding to the expected protein size was identified. The expressed aglycosylated protein size 
was confirmed and since the WB result of the original variant is comparable, the biological 
characterisation is found acceptable.

EMA/417361/2023 
Page 9/21 
 
 
 
 
3.2.4.  Control of active substance (CTD module 3.2.S.4) 
The active substance specification for Raxtozinameran / Omicron (XBB.1.5) contains tests for 
appearance (clarity, coloration (Ph. Eur.)), pH (Ph. Eur.), content (RNA Concentration) (UV 
Spectroscopy), Identity of Encoded RNA Sequence (ddPCR, RT-PCR), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel 
Electrophoresis), 5’- Cap (RP-HPLC), Poly(A) Tail (ddPCR), Poly(A) Tail Length (IP-RP-HPLC), Residual 
DNA Template (qPCR), dsRNA (Immunoblot), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and Bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification for Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant active substance is based on the available 
data and follows the specification established and approved for the original variant and therefore is 
considered adequate.  The acceptance criteria are applicable from batch release to end of shelf-life. 
Analytical procedures for (XBB.1.5) Omicron variant active substance release and stability testing are 
listed and briefly described in the dossier.  Most of the analytical procedures are identical to the 
corresponding commercial BNT162b2 original vaccine procedures, apart from identity testing, for which 
Omicron XBB.1.5 variant-specific reagents are utilized. Considering that the active substance 
concentration, formulation process and process control remain unchanged as compared to BNT162b2 
original active substance and only a change in nucleotide sequence is differentiating the Omicron 
(XBB.1.5) variant, the approach is endorsed. The method is sufficiently described, and additional 
validation exercises have been performed. 
The Poly A Tail Length procedure based on IP-RP-HPLC has been slightly revised as compared to the 
procedure applied for the original variant. This difference is considered minor and the revised 
procedure is found acceptable. 
Batch results presented met the specification acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. The 
specification and limits for Omicron (XBB.1.5) variant active substance is based on the BNT162b2 
original active substance. Although limited data is provided for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant to support 
these limits, the strategy is found acceptable considering that only a change in the nucleotide 
sequence is driving the present variation. 
3.2.5.  Reference standards of materials (CTD module 3.2.S.5) 
The reference standards are the same as currently approved for tozinameran, riltozinameran and 
famtozinameran. 
3.2.6.  Container closure system (CTD module 3.2.S.6) 
The container closure system is the same as currently approved for tozinameran, riltozinameran and 
famtozinameran. 
3.2.7.  Stability (CTD module 3.2.S.7) 
The proposed shelf-life for the Omicron (XBB.1.5) active substance is 6 months when stored at the -
intended storage condition of -20 ± 5°C in EVA bags. Thus, the proposed shelf-life and storage 
conditions are identical to those for the original variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529) and Omicron 
(BA.4/BA.5). The shelf-life claim is based on primary stability studies conducted on the commercial 
active substance batches of the original variant and Omicron (BA.4/BA.5) variant. 
Stability studies for two Omicron XBB.1.5 batches are on-going. In response to a question raised, the 
MAH submitted long-term stability data and stability data from accelerated storage conditions for both

batches. All results met the specification acceptance criteria. The MAH commits to update section 
3.2.S.7 with updated real-time stability data by the end of Q1 2024. This is found acceptable. 
3.3.  Finished product (CTD module 3.2.P) 
3.3.1.  Description and composition of the drug product (CTD module 
3.2.P.1) 
The BNT162b2 Omicron (XBB.1.5) Variant finished product (herein referred to as Variant), is supplied 
as a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous 
cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular administration.  
There are 6 presentations for the Variant finished product providing doses of either 30, 10 or 3 µg of 
Raxtozinameran per dose in multi-dose vial (MDV) and single-dose vial (SDV) presentations.  
Each presentation is formulated in Tris buffer, sucrose, pH 7.4. The presentations differ in RNA 
concentration (0.1 mg/mL and 0.033 mg/mL), fill volume, and requirement for dilution prior to 
administration and are summarized in Table P.1-1. 
Table P.1-1. Drug Product Presentations 
The finished product is supplied in a 2 mL glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl elastomeric stopper and 
an aluminium seal with a flip-off plastic cap. 
The composition of the finished product, including quality standard, function, concentration and 
amount per dose for the finished product presentations were provided. The list of excipients are stated 
in section 3.1 of this report and in SmPC Section 6.1. 
All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 and the structural lipid DSPC  
comply to Ph. Eur. grade. The functional lipids, the structural lipids as well as the Tris buffer and 
sucrose are all used in the currently approved Tris/sucrose vaccine finished products of Comirnaty. 
The container closure system is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and is the same container closure system as for the already approved 
Tris/sucrose vaccine drug product of Comirnaty. 
The processing aids and active substance formulation buffer components are residues that are 
essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as excipients in the 
finished product.

3.3.2.  Pharmaceutical development (CTD module 3.2.P.2) 
The Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of lipid 
nanoparticles in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular administration. The finished 
product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL or 0.033 mg/mL total RNA in Tris buffer, sucrose, pH 7.4. There 
are 6 presentations for the Variant finished product providing doses of either 30, 10 or 3 µg RNA. The 
ratio of RNA to lipid components is also constant across the presentations. 
The variant vaccine finished product is formulated and manufactured in a highly similar way as the 
original finished product in the Tris/Sucrose formulation. As the overall length of the omicron XBB.1.5 
RNA is essentially the same as that of the original vaccine RNA, it is argued by the MAH, that no 
change in physicochemical properties, processability, or stability is expected for the Omicron XBB.1.5 
active substance as compared to the original active substance. Therefore, no change in 
physicochemical properties, processability, or stability of the finished product is expected for the 
omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine as compared to the original vaccine. This is agreed to. 
A new QTPP has been developed and provided for the Omicron XBB.1.5 containing vaccine finished 
product as a basis for the development and reflects the evolution of the Tris/Sucrose vaccine to 
address new virus variants. The QTPP was provided and reflects the evolution of the Tris/Sucrose 
vaccine to address new virus variants. 
A development history has been provided. It gives a comparison of the finished product manufacturing 
processes and release criteria for the original, bivalent (original, omicron BA.4/BA.5) and the omicron 
XBB.1.5 variant vaccine. The omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished product will be administered at 
the same dose as the already approved original and/or bivalent vaccine presentations of Comirnaty. It 
has been shown that the manufacturing processes for the large scale lots are highly similar between 
the Tris/Sucrose original vaccine, the bivalent finished product and the XBB.1.5 variant finished 
product. 
Comparability has previously been acceptably demonstrated between clinical and commercial scale 
original drug product, between various manufacturing sites and between the PBS/sucrose finished  
product and Tris/sucrose finished product via comprehensive studies including both release testing and 
extended characterization testing. Comparability has also been established and sufficiently 
demonstrated between the bivalent vaccine finished products (original and omicron BA.1, original and 
omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) to the original finished product based on an evaluation of release testing 
results against the acceptance criteria in the finished product specification as well as via extended 
characterization testing. 
For the omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine, batch analysis data are provided for the batches 
manufactured to date. All these batches met the acceptance criteria in the respective specifications 
documents for each presentation and comparability has been established based on an evaluation of 
these release testing results. Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, 
and the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original vaccine finished product and the bivalent 
vaccine finished products, extensive prior experience is leveraged, and the comparability 
demonstration found sufficient and agreed to. This is found acceptable. 
In conclusion, the information provided in section 3.2.P.2 on Pharmaceutical development for the 
omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished product is found sufficient and acceptable.

3.3.3.  Manufacture (CTD module 3.2.P.3) 
The monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine is manufactured at some of the existing and approved manufacturing 
sites used for the original and bivalent Comirnaty Tris/Sucrose vaccine formulations using the same 
platform process. The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk drug 
product formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. The manufacturing process is the same as for 
the current approved vaccines (monovalent Original, bivalent Original/Omicron B.1 and bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) . The manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and suitable in-
process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
No process validation is performed for the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine. Confirmatory batches are 
manufactured at the approved manufacturing sites used the validated manufacturing process.  
3.3.4.  Control of excipients (CTD module 3.2.P.4) 
The monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine contains the same excipients as the currently approved Comirnaty 
vaccines (Tris/Sucrose formulations). 
The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) consists of two functional lipids; a cationic lipid (ALC-0315) and a 
PEGylated lipid (ALC-0159) and two structural lipids; DSPC and cholesterol. Other excipients are 
sucrose, tromethamine (Tris base), Tris HCl and water. Processing aids used during manufacturing are 
ethanol, citric acid monohydrate, sodium hydroxide, HEPES and EDTA. All excipients are sufficiently 
controlled in accordance with in-house specifications and/or Ph. Eur. monographs.

based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), 
Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). 
The finished product specifications for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine includes a comprehensive 
set of relevant tests with corresponding acceptance criteria and are based on those established for the 
original finished product and the bivalent vaccine finished products for the majority of the test 
attributes. The acceptance criteria for release and stability testing of the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant 
vaccine finished products (0.1 mg/mL and 0.033 mg/mL) are the same as for the original vaccine 
finished product and bivalent vaccine drug product for all quality attributes, with the exception of 
appearance, RNA content and Lipid content which were updated for the 0.033 mg/mL finished product 
(approved in procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/X/180) and are related to the lower RNA concentration for 
this presentation.  
Since the acceptance criteria for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished products are based on 
the currently approved original vaccine finished product (and bivalent vaccine finished product) for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/417361/2023 
Page 13/21 
 
 
 
 
majority of test attributes, these acceptance criteria for test attributes are considered as clinically 
qualified to ensure quality, efficacy and safety. 
The test methods used for the original Tris/Sucrose finished product are identical to those used for the 
omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished products, except for the identity methods, which differ solely 
in the variant-specific PCR primers used in the assay. The ddPCR method has been added allowing for 
identity to be tested by either ddPCR or RT-PCR. It can be noted that the Identity test by ddPCR was 
first introduced for the bivalent vaccine finished product. 
Finished product method verifications/validations performed for the original vaccine are considered 
applicable to the omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine drug product since the operating parameters of the methods 
are unchanged and this is agreed to. Due to the variant specific reagents (primers), supplemental 
validation of RT-PCR and ddPCR methods for identity were performed and the reports are provided. 
Furthermore, as there were no changes to the IVE assay when compared to the method previously 
approved, a supplemental validation of the IVE method specific to omicron XBB.1.5 was performed and 
the report provided. This is found acceptable. 
For the omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine, batch analysis data are provided for the batches 
manufactured to date, . All these batches met the acceptance criteria in respective specifications 
documents for each presentation and comparability has been established based on an evaluation of 
these release testing results. This is found acceptable.  
Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, and the use of the same 
manufacturing sites as the original vaccine finished product and the bivalent vaccine finished products, 
extensive prior experience is leveraged, and the comparability demonstration is found sufficient and 
agreed to. This is found acceptable.  
In addition, stability studies have been initiated for the omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine finished product. 
The information provided on control of finished product is found sufficient and acceptable. 
3.3.6.  Reference standards or materials (CTD module 3.2.P.6) 
The reference standards are the same as currently approved for the currently approved Comirnaty 
vaccine (Tris/Sucrose formulation). 
3.3.7.  Container closure system (CTD module 3.2.P.7) 
The container closure system is the same as for the currently approved Comirnaty vaccine 
(Tris/Sucrose formulation). No new information is provided. The monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine is filled in 
type 1 borosilicate glass or aluminosilicate glass vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium 
vial seal. 
3.3.8.  Stability (CTD module 3.2.P.8) 
The proposed shelf-life for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished product at 0.1 mg/mL is 18 
months when stored at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60 °C, including a short-term 
storage at 5 ± 3°C for up to 10 weeks (within the 18-month shelf-life). Furthermore, the proposed 
shelf-life for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant drug product formulated at 0.033 mg/mL is 12 months at 
the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60 °C including a short-term storage at 5 ± 3°C for 
up to 10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). 
Assessment report  
EMA/417361/2023 
Page 14/21 
 
 
 
 
The proposed shelf-lives for both omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished products (0.1 mg/mL and 
0.033 mg/mL) are based on the shelf-life for the original Tris/sucrose finished product at 0.1 mg/mL as 
well as for to the approved shelf-life for the 0.033 mg/mL bivalent (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 
variant) vaccine finished product (approved via procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/X/180). Release data are 
available for the commercial scale XBB.1.5 vaccine finished product stored at the intended storage 
condition (-90 to -60 °C) as well as at the accelerated storage conditions (5 ± 3°C). These stability 
studies are currently on-going and data from these studies will be used to confirm the shelf shelf-life of 
the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished product. The original Tris/sucrose studies as well as the 
bivalent studies (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant) are also on-going and will be used to extend 
the shelf life based on the acceptability of these data. 
This approach to extrapolate the shelf-life from the already authorized original vaccine to the Omicron 
XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished product is found acceptable since comparability has previously been 
acceptably demonstrated for a number of various comparisons of Comirnaty finished product such as 
between clinical and commercial scale original finished product, between various manufacturing sites, 
between the PBS/sucrose finished product and the Tris/sucrose finished product and between the 
monovalent and bivalent vaccine finished product. Comparability has been demonstrated via 
comprehensive studies including both release testing and extended characterization testing. Due to the 
application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, and the use of the same manufacturing 
sites as the original drug product, extensive prior experience is leveraged for the Omicron XBB.1.5 
variant vaccine finished product and comparability previously convincingly proven and concluded. 
Therefore, it is agreed to the proposed shelf-life for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine finished 
product at 0.1 mg/mL of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -
60 °C, including a short-term storage at 5 ± 3°C for up to 10 weeks (within the 18-month shelf-life). 
In addition, it is also agreed to the proposed shelf-life for the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant finished product 
at 0.033 mg/mL of 12 months at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60 °C including a 
short-term storage at 5 ± 3°C for up to 10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). This is in-line with 
the wording in section 6.3 in the SmPC and is found acceptable. 
3.3.9.  Appendices (CTD module 3.2.A) 
Not applicable. 
3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, one question was raised on active 
substance stability data. In response the MAH submitted stability data from two batches and 
committed to update the dossier with real-time stability data by the end of Q1 2024. This was 
considered acceptable. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

4.  Non-clinical aspects 
4.1.  Introduction 
For this application concerning a monovalent Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine, novel non-clinical data 
on immunogenicity in mice have been provided. In addition, a study report on distribution and protein 
expression in mice after injection of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) modRNA lipid nanoparticle 
(LNP) was submitted. 
All aspects on non-clinical safety are considered covered by studies supporting the initial Comirnaty 
MAA. 
4.2.  Pharmacology 
Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Monovalent and Bivalent Omicron XBB.1.5 Sublineage-Modified Vaccines 
in Naïve Mice as a Primary Series 
XBB.1.5 sublineage-modified monovalent and bivalent vaccines as a primary 2-dose series induced 
robust neutralizing antibody responses against the matched and antigenically related strains. 
Compared to the bivalent BNT162b2 (WT+BA.4-5), XBB.1.5 modified monovalent and bivalent (BA.4-
5+XBB.1.5) vaccines produced 19-to-42-fold higher neutralizing antibody response against XBB.1.5, 
XBB.1.16, XBB.1.16.1 and XBB.2.3. The strongest responses were observed in the monovalent 
BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 group. None of the XBB sublineages tested showed evidence of immune escape. 
Monovalent and bivalent vaccines containing XBB.1.5 induced a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response.

Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Monovalent and Bivalent Omicron XBB.1.5 Sublineage-Modified Vaccines 
in BNT162b2 Experienced Mice as a Fourth Dose Booster 
In BNT162b2 experienced mice, XBB.1.5 variant-modified vaccines induced robust neutralizing 
antibody responses against the Wuhan reference strain and Omicron sublineages (BA.4-5, XBB.1.5, 
XBB.1.16, XBB.1.16.1 and XBB.2.3) as a fourth dose booster. Monovalent BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 induced 
four-to-six-fold higher neutralizing responses against Omicron sublineages XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, 
XBB.1.16.1 and XBB.2.3 compared to benchmark bivalent BNT162b2 (WT + BA.4-5). None of the XBB 
sublineages tested showed evidence of immune escape. Monovalent and bivalent vaccines containing 
XBB.1.5 formulations induced robust T cell responses. Together these data suggest that XBB.1.5 
sublineage-modified monovalent or bivalent vaccines improve immune responses against more 
currently dominant circulating XBB sublineages.

4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
8-Day (1-Dose) Intramuscular Investigative Study of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) ModRNA LNP in 
CD-1 Male Mice 
Intramuscular administration of GFP modRNA LNP as a single dose of 2 μg to CD-1 male mice was 
tolerated through 168 hours post dose (HPD) and did not induce a strong innate immune response. 
IFN-α, CXCL1 (KC), IL-6, CCL2 (MCP-1), and CXCL10 (IP-10) levels peaked at 6 HPD. GFP levels in 
serum peaked at 6 HPD and gradually declined through 168 HPD. GFP distribution by in situ 
hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was most frequent at the injection site as well as 
in the draining and inguinal lymph nodes and spleen, with rare observations in the liver.  
GFP+ signal by IHC and/or ISH was consistently detected in multiple cell types at the injection sites 
from GFP modRNA LNP-administered mice: adipocytes, endothelium and perivascular connective tissue 
from thin-walled vessels (presumptive venules, capillaries, lymphatics), dermal fibroblasts, muscle 
connective tissues (epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium), rare myocytes, and mononuclear cells, 
as well as presumptive leukocytes in lymph nodes and spleen, and hepatocytes in liver (only by ISH at 
6 HPD). Frequency of positive signal in muscle compartments in the injection site was generally 
greatest at 6 and 24 HPD except in myocytes where the highest incidence occurred at 168 HPD. GFP+ 
staining was not observed in heart by either method. IHC and ISH staining generally overlapped in the 
cell types labelled across timepoints with a few noteworthy exceptions: in spleen and liver wherein 
GFP+ expression was only detectable by ISH and in inguinal LN where ISH+ labelling was present in 
multiple animals across timepoints but IHC+ labelling was only observed in 2 animals. Electron 
microscopy was conducted on spleen, draining LN, and injection site muscle from a subset of animals 
at 6, 24, and 72 HPD. Structures consistent with LNPs were detected in spleen samples at 24 and 72 
HPD, but not at 6 HPD nor in the draining LN or injection site muscle samples.

4.4.  Discussion 
To support the approval of the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine, the MAH has provided mouse 
immunogenicity data comparing the response to the XBB.1.5 vaccine with that of the bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine as well as an investigational bivalent Omicron BA.4-5/Omicron 
XBB.1.5 vaccine. Comparisons were made both for a primary series and for a fourth dose booster in 
mice that previously received the Original vaccine in a primary series and the bivalent 
Original/OmicronBA.4-5 vaccine as a booster.  
In both cases, the XBB.1.5 containing vaccines provided a superior response to XBB.1.5 and other 
related variants. The monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine showed a higher response than the bivalent variant 
vaccine.  
These data support the assumption that the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine is expected to provide better 
protection to XBB.1.5 and other related variants than previously approved variant vaccines. 
With this submission the MAH has also provided data from a distribution study in mice with lipid 
nanoparticles containing modRNA for green fluorescent protein (GFP). This data showed presence of 
modRNA and expression of GFP predominantly at the injection site, draining lymph nodes and spleen 
with rare observations in the liver. These data are in line with information submitted with the original 
MAA where modRNA expressing luciferase was used.  
4.5.  Conclusions on non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the non-clinical immunogenicity data are supporting the assumption 
that the Omicron XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine is expected to provide better protection to XBB.1.5 and 
other related variants than previously approved variant vaccines. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  relevant  sections  of  the  SmPC,  PL  and  Labelling  are  being  updated  to 
adequately reflect the addition of a new strain (Omicron XBB.1.5, raxtozinameran). 
5.1.1.  Quick Response (QR) code 
The updates of the QR code/URL to include further references to Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5, as well 
as the necessary layout changes on the website shall be submitted and assessed via an Article 61.3 
notification (post-authorisation). 
6.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
With this type II variation, the MAH sought the introduction of a monovalent vaccine targeting SARS-
CoV-2 Omicron strain XBB.1.5 to assist in the continued management of COVID-19. This is in line with 
EMA/ECDC statement, where it was recommended that “the inclusion of a strain belonging to the XBB 
family of Omicron subvariants is adequate to ensure cross-reactivity against current dominant and 
emerging strains, and XBB.1.5 is considered as a reasonable choice to increase the breadth of 
immunity also against XBB descendent lineages”. 
The Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine is manufactured at previously authorised/licensed Pfizer/BioNTech sites, 
formulated in Tris/Sucrose and presented as multi-dose vials (MDV) and single dose vials (SDV).

The MAH has submitted a full quality data package for Omicron XBB.1.5 active substance and 
monovalent finished product formulations. Information on development, manufacture and control of 
the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. During the 
procedure, one question was raised on active substance stability data. In response the MAH submitted 
stability data from two batches and committed to update the dossier with real-time stability data by 
the end of Q1 2024. This was considered acceptable. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The 
quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
As supportive, the MAH has also provided mouse immunogenicity data comparing the response of the 
Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine with that of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and of the investigational 
bivalent Omicron BA.4-5/Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine for both a primary series and booster. In both 
cases, the XBB.1.5 containing vaccines provided a superior response to XBB.1.5 strain. The 
monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine showed a higher response than the bivalent. These data were acceptable. 
The CHMP considers acceptable an approval based on quality and supportive non-clinical data. The 
absence of clinical data is considered satisfactory as this platform has shown predictability of clinical 
immunogenicity and reactogenicity following the variants updates to BA.1 and BA.4-5. This is in line 
with EMA/ECDC statement. The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY, remains positive. 
7.  Recommendations

Brief description of the product 
Voclosporin  
Centralised 
Lupkynis 
Chemical class: 
Voclosporin, a novel CNI, is structurally similar to cyclosporine A (CsA) 
except for a modification to the amino acid-1 region. 
Summary of mode of action: 
Voclosporin is a CNI immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin in a dose-
dependent manner up to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Activation of 
lymphocytes involves an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. 
Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase whose activity is 
required for the induction of T-cell lymphokine production and proliferation. 
The immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte 
proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, and expression of T-cell activation 
surface antigens.

Indication:  
Lupkynis is indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of adult patients with 
active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN). 
LN is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It usually arises 
within 5 years of diagnosis, and its prevalence varies, according to published studies, from 30 to 90% 
(Schieppati et al, 2009).  
Incidence and Prevalence:  
The prevalence of LN was calculated as ranging between 0.44 and 1.4 per 10,000 (Table 1).

Incidence and prevalence rates per 10,000 were derived from rates reported per 100,000 in the original study reports. LN=Lupus 
nephritis. 
Estimates of incidence and prevalence based on studies looking specifically at patients diagnosed with LN 
are limited (Table 1). Therefore, the incidence and prevalence were calculated based on the prevalence of 
SLE and the estimated proportion of patients diagnosed with SLE who go on to develop LN. The 
calculation is based on the racial mix in the UK and was extrapolated to the EU. This calculation resulted 
in that the total proportion of EU patients with SLE who will develop LN is estimated to be 25.3%. The 
estimated prevalence of LN ranged from 0.63 to 2.28 per 10,000 persons (Table 2).

1. Incidence data was reported for France, Iceland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK; and prevalence data was reported for Finland, France, Germany, 
Iceland, Italy, Northern Ireland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Incidence and prevalence rates per 10,000 for SLE were derived from rates reported 
per 100,000 in the original study report. Incidence and prevalence rates per 10,000 for LN were estimated by extrapolation based on the 
assumption of 25% of SLE patients manifesting LN. Ranges reported in this table are based on data for “whole populations”, rather than data 
reported for sub-groups according to individual ethnic group. LN=Lupus nephritis; SLE=Systemic lupus erythematosus. 
A systematic literature review showed a worldwide variation, with the highest incidence reported in North 
America (23.2/100,000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4, 24.0) and the lowest incidences 
reported in Africa (0.3/100,000 person-years) and Ukraine (0.3/100,000 person-years, 95% CI: 0.0, 1.5). 
In general, European countries had a lower incidence of SLE, whereas Asia, Australia and the Americas 
had a higher incidence (Rees et al, 2017).  
The prevalence of LN derived from SLE studies was found to be 0.63-2.28/10,000 based on the 
Danchenko et al, 2006 review (Danchenko et al, 2006) and 0.41-3.08/10,000 based on 23 individual 
studies conducted across the EU (Table 2). This is of a similar order to the three studies which examined 
the prevalence of LN directly where the range was 0.44-1.40/10,000 (Table 1). 
A recent meta-analysis showed that the prevalence rate of biopsy-proven LN among patients with SLE 
ranged from 16.9% to 42.8% (Wang et al, 2017).  
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or ethnic origin 
and risk factors for the disease:  
Age and Gender 
SLE 
SLE prevalence is highest among females, with a female to male ratio ranging between 1.2:1 and 15:1. 
The peak age of prevalence is between 45 and 69 years for females and between 40 and 89 years for males 
(Rees et al, 2017).  
LN 
A meta-analysis designed to determine the prevalence of biopsy-proven LN showed that biopsy-proven 
LN developed in about 29% of SLE patients; the mean age of patients with SLE at renal biopsy was 
approximately 30 years and 85% of patients with biopsy-proven LN were female. The sex distribution and 
ages of patients with biopsy-proven LN varied with geography and ethnicity. In Pakistan, the percentage 
of female patients with biopsy-proven LN was 51.4%, compared with 84.6% in Northwest England. 
 
 
Among Afro-Caribbean and Chinese females, the prevalence rate of LN was highest in those aged 20-39 
years, whereas among white and Indo-Asian females, it was highest in those aged 40-59 years (Wang et al, 
2017).  
Racial and/or ethnic origin  
Hanly and colleagues studied a large (N=1,827) multi-ethnic cohort of patients with SLE across the EU, 
United States (US), Canada, Mexico and Asia (Hanly et al, 2016). SLE was diagnosed according to 
American College of Rheumatology criteria and LN was defined by the International Society of 
Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society Classification (Hochberg, 1997; Tan et al, 1982; Weening et 
al, 2004). The proportion of patients with SLE who developed LN by race/ethnicity was: 20.3% 
Caucasian, 36.8% Asian, 39.9% African; 49.3% Hispanic and 33.8% Other (Hanly et al, 2016).  
In a US-based study of 353 patients with SLE, Bastian and colleagues also reported that the rate of 
occurrence of LN was dependent on race/ethnicity: LN occurred in 14.3% of patients of Caucasian origin, 
43.1% Hispanic and 50.5% African-American (Bastian et al, 2002). 
Similar findings were reported by Patel and colleagues in a UK-based study of the prevalence of biopsy 
proven LN in the UK: 10% of white patients with SLE developed LN compared with 27% of patients of 
Indo-Asian descent and 58% of patients of Afro-Caribbean descent (Patel et al, 2006). 
Risk factors 
Distinct genetic factors were associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. Gene-
based analyses showed significant associations between variation in single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 
genes like ZNF546, TRIM15, and TRIMI0 and LN among South Europeans, and TTC34 was significantly 
associated with LN among Hispanics (Lanata et al, 2018).  
Risk factors for the development of LN include clinical features like malar rash, pericarditis, arterial 
hypertension, anaemia, low levels of serum complements, and raised anti-double stranded 
deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA). Additional risk factors are male gender and younger age of disease onset 
(Burling et al, 2007; Faezi, 2017; Galindo-Izquierdo et al, 2016).  
The main existing treatment options:  
The Joint European League Against Rheumatism and European Renal Association–European Dialysis and 
Transplant Association recommends immunosuppressive treatment and hydroxychloroquine (Bertsias 
et al, 2012). In active proliferative LN, initial treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (2–3 g/day or 
mycophenolic acid (MPA) at equivalent dose) or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg×6 
biweekly doses), both combined with glucocorticoids (pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone, then oral 
prednisone 0.3–0.5 mg/kg/day) is recommended. MMF/CNI (especially tacrolimus) combination and 
high-dose cyclophosphamide are alternatives for patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and adverse 
prognostic factors (Fanouriakis et al, 2020). 
Subsequent long-term treatment with MMF or azathioprine should follow, with no or low-dose 
(<7.5 mg/day) glucocorticoids (Fanouriakis et al, 2020). 
In non-responding disease, switch of immunosuppressants or use of rituximab are recommended. In pure 
membranous LN with nephrotic-range proteinuria or proteinuria >1 g/24 hours despite renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone blockade, MMF in combination with glucocorticoids is preferred (Fanouriakis et al, 2020).  
Belimumab has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recently by European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) on 30 April 2021 for LN. Voclosporin was approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of LN on 22 Jan 2021. All other treatments as described in Table 3 are used off label.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated and treated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: 
LN is the most common serious manifestation of SLE and is a cause of renal failure and mortality 
(Schieppati et al, 2009). LN manifests as diverse patterns of immune-complex mediated renal disease 
affecting glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments. In patients with LN, renal damage 
results in proteinuria and/or haematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced 
creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and can lead to permanent and 
irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), i.e., the need for 
long-term dialysis or transplantation.  
LN is divided into different classes as shown in Table 4. 
Table 4. LN Classes 
Classification category 
Class I: minimal mesangial 
Class II: mesangial 
proliferative 
Class III: focal LN 
Class IV: diffuse LN 
Class V: membranous 
nephropathy 
Class VI: advanced 
sclerosing lupus 
Clinical Features 
Normal/minimal proteinuria, normal creatinine. Earliest and mildest form of 
glomerular involvement. 
Microscopic haematuria ± proteinuria. Hypertension uncommon and nephrotic 
syndrome plus renal insufficiency rarely seen. 
Haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, reduced eGFR ± nephrotic syndrome. 
Most common and severe form of LN. Clinical features as for class III but also 
significantly low complement 3 and high dsDNA, especially in active disease. 
Nephrotic syndrome, microscopic haematuria, hypertension, normal/high 
creatinine. Can present without other clinical or serological manifestations of SLE 
but electron microscopy features will distinguish it from the idiopathic form. 
Slowly progressive renal failure with proteinuria and bland urine sediment. 
Adapted from Bomback AS, Appel GB. Lupus nephritis: Diagnosis and classification. UpToDate 2020 (Bomback & Appel, 
2021). 
In the US, approximately 35% of adults with SLE have LN at the time of diagnosis with an estimated 
50%-60% developing LN during the first 10 years of the disease (Hahn et al, 2012); the figures from 
Europe are not available. It is estimated that 10%-30% of patients with LN will develop ESRD (Almaani 
et al, 2017; Costenbader et al, 2011; Tektonidou et al, 2016); the risk varies with histologic class and is 
highest in patients with Class III and IV proliferative LN. The development of ESRD in LN patients has 
been associated with a 26-fold increase in mortality risk compared with a demographically matched 
general population (Yap et al, 2012). 
The overall 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival rates for patients with biopsy-proven LN were 94%, 86% and 
71%, respectively. Class IV nephritis, present in 40% of patients with biopsy-proven LN, was a risk factor 
for renal failure that contributed to poor prognosis in patients with SLE (Wang et al, 2017).  
 
 
 
Important co-morbidities: 
Patients with SLE and LN are frequently burdened with a variety of comorbidities like cardiovascular 
disease (mainly hypertension), atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, obesity, infections, anaemia, 
malignancies, osteoporosis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, 
and anxiety (Gergianaki & Bertsias, 2018; Tzavara et al, 2013). The prevalence of posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) among patients with SLE ranges from 0.7% to 1.4% with recurrence in 
up to 15% of cases and risk factors include SLE activity, hypertension, haematologic and renal disease 
(Valdez-Lopez 2021).  
 
 
Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage is described in Table 5. The 
safety concerns from non-clinical data are summarised in Table 6. 
Table 5. Key safety findings from non-clinical studies with voclosporin and relevance to human 
usage

Relevance to human usage 
Toxicity 
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies 
Single-Dose Toxicology 
Single intravenous doses of voclosporin up to 2.5 mg/kg, 
the highest dose tested, were well tolerated in Sprague 
Dawley rats. In Beagle dogs, emesis was the only effect 
noted with single oral doses of mix-ISA247 (isomeric 
mixture of voclosporin1) up to 75 mg/kg. 
Repeat-Dose Toxicology  
In the rat, cataract formation, renal effects and neuro-
histological findings were the primary adverse effects. 
Cataract formation is considered to be a species-specific, 
class related effect, which is also observed with CsA 
(Avery et al, 1991; Bernauer et al, 1991; Cruz et al, 1996; 
O'Riordan et al, 1994).  
No safety concern relevant to human use has arisen 
from these non-clinical data. 
Cataract: Cataract is considered to be species 
specific and is not considered to be a safety concern 
relevant to human use.  
Renal effects included increases in blood urea nitrogen and 
creatinine, tubular basophilia and 
degeneration/regeneration, and corticomedullary 
mineralization. These findings generally occurred in 
chronic repeat-dose studies at dose levels of ≥2.5 
mg/kg/day. It is unclear whether all of the renal findings 
are directly treatment-related or whether exposure to mix-
ISA247, voclosporin or CsA produced an exacerbation of a 
normal biological response since the spectrum of observed 
microscopic renal changes can arise spontaneously in the 
kidneys of male rats, especially as they age. 
The neuro-histological effects included gliosis and 
perivascular infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord.  
The observed neuro-histopathological changes in rats were 
confirmed to be dose-dependent and are thought to be a 
species-specific effect, as they were not observed in repeat-
dose toxicology studies of mix-ISA247 in dogs or 
monkeys. CsA was associated with the same neuro-
histopathological findings in the 13-week bridging study in 
rats in which CsA was included as a comparator control.  
The proposed therapeutic dose of voclosporin for LN of 
23.7 mg BID (approximately 0.4 mg/kg BID) is less than 
the dose of CsA typically used in transplant patients (1.5 to 
3.0 mg/kg BID) (Serkova et al, 2004), the population in 
which CsA-related neurologic signs occur.  
Renal effects: Nephrotoxicity (Acute and chronic) 
is considered an Important Potential Risk. 
Neurological effects: The observed neuro-
histopathological changes in rats were not observed 
in repeat-dose toxicology studies of mix-ISA247 in 
other species. In rats, neuro-histopathological 
findings related to voclosporin have also been 
shown to be dose dependent. The proposed 
therapeutic dose of voclosporin for lupus nephritis 
(23.7 mg BID), corresponding to 0.4 mg/kg BID 
for a typical 60 kg patient) is less than the dose of 
CsA typically used (eg, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg BID) 
(Serkova et al, 2004 in which CsA-related 
neurologic signs occur. Given the lack of inter- and 
intra-patient variability with voclosporin, 
physicians will be able to maintain patients with the 
correct dosage in lupus nephritis. Hypomagnesemia 
has not been seen with voclosporin, discounting 
1 Voclosporin (90 to 95% trans-isomer) is the active ingredient in Lupkynis. Animal reproductive studies were primarily conducted with an 
approximate 50:50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis-isomer (mix-ISA247). Similarity of the toxicity effects of the 50:50 mixture and voclosporin 
was demonstrated in comparative toxicity studies with adult rats. Interconversion between cis and trans isomers was not detected with in vitro or 
in vivo studies.

Lymphomas and malignancies: Malignancies 
(including lymphomas) associated with long term 
use is considered an Important Potential Risk. 
Use in pregnancy will be considered Missing 
Information. 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies 
In the 39-week chronic monkey study, lymphosarcoma was 
one of the main toxicological findings in the high-dose 
animals (1 male and 4 females given mix-ISA247 at a dose 
level of 150 mg/kg/day). No lymphosarcomas were 
observed in the mid- or low-dose animals. In this study, 
calcineurin inhibition data confirmed that the mid- and 
high-dose monkeys had a high level of immunosuppression 
where calcineurin inhibition was in excess (>80%), well in 
excess for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as 
LN. The Sponsor believes that this also applies to the 
treatment of other autoimmune diseases such as LN. 
Immunosuppressed monkeys are especially at risk of 
developing viral-related malignancies. In particular, several 
literature reports have shown that development of 
lymphosarcomas in non-human primates is markedly 
increased with immunosuppressive therapy (Gaschen & 
Schuurman, 2001; McInnes et al, 2002; Schmidtko et al, 
2002). The increase in incidence of lymphoma is 
considered to be a class effect of immunosuppressive 
agents (CsA and tacrolimus product information feature 
this observation). Taking the above into consideration, the 
finding of lymphosarcoma in the monkey is not unexpected 
and does not raise additional concern. Likewise, findings of 
splenic hyperplasia and gingival hyperplasia observed at 
the mix-ISA247 dose levels of 75 and 150 mg/kg/day were 
considered to be related to pharmacologic activity. 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for 
voclosporin in pregnant rabbits was determined to be 1 
mg/kg/day and foetal toxicity (reduced foetal body weights 
and skeletal variations) was only observed at doses 
associated with maternal toxicity (based on swollen 
mammary glands, reduced body weights, clinical 
observations and food consumption effects).  
Voclosporin was not considered teratogenic.  
Fertility studies were conducted with mix-ISA247 in rats 
with no treatment-related changes in fertility, mating 
parameters, sperm evaluations, embryonic viability or in 
the number and location of implantation sites or 
observations on placentae. No general behavioural, 
reproductive or developmental toxicities were noted in the 
first generation ( F1) generation. No fertility or early 
embryonic developmental toxicity studies have been 
conducted with voclosporin. However, as voclosporin is 
more bioavailable than the cis-isomer, it is reasonable to 
assume that the fertility or early embryonic developmental 
toxicity of voclosporin is comparable to that of mix-
ISA247. 
A placental and milk transfer study with [14C]-voclosporin 
in rats indicated that transfer of radioactivity across the 
placental barrier was slow and limited, while transfer into 
milk was relatively rapid, but systemic absorption by the 
pups was slow and limited. 
The toxicity profile of voclosporin in juvenile rats was 
similar to that seen in conventional studies in adult rats, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relevance to human usage 
No safety concern relevant to human use has arisen 
from these non-clinical data. 
Malignancies (including lymphomas) associated 
with long term use is considered an Important 
Potential Risk. 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies 
with similar changes observed in the thymus, kidney, brain 
and sciatic nerve. 
Genotoxicity 
Voclosporin was not mutagenic in the Ames test or in a 
chromosomal aberration study, with and without metabolic 
activation. Mix-ISA247 showed no genotoxic potential in 
the standard International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
battery of genotoxicity assays: Ames, chromosomal 
aberration with and without metabolic activation, and the in 
vivo rat micronucleus assay. Additionally, the in-silico 
assessment of 20 voclosporin-related substances concluded 
that these compounds did not show evidence of genotoxic 
potential.  
Carcinogenicity  
In a 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, administration of 
voclosporin at oral doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day resulted 
in an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in high 
dose females and a dose-responsive trend for increase in 
malignant lymphoma in males. Malignant lymphoma was 
considered drug related in mice. In a 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study, oral administration of voclosporin at 
doses up to 1.25 mg/kg/day in males and 2.5 mg/kg/day in 
females (doses that result in approximately similar drug 
exposures in rats) resulted in no statistically significant 
increases of tumour incidences. In a 39-week oral 
toxicology study with monkeys, malignant lymphomas 
occurred at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day. At this dose, monkeys 
experienced high levels of immunosuppression as indicated 
by maximum calcineurin inhibition levels (Emax) of greater 
than 80%. 
Safety pharmacology 
Clinical data do not show a signal for an increased 
risk  of  arrhythmias  in  patients  with  LN  at  a 
voclosporin dose level of 23.7 mg BID. The SmPC 
Section  4.4  provides  information  allowing  the 
prescriber  to  identify  circumstances  which  may 
increase 
risk  of  QT  prolongation.  QT 
prolongation and arrhythmias are not considered to 
be an important risk for voclosporin  
the 
Cardiovascular system, including potential effect on the QT interval 
The results of a human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) 
assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells indicated that mix-
ISA247 and voclosporin inhibited repolarizing currents 
through hERG K+ channels in vitro at 20% inhibitory 
concentration (IC20) values of approximately 6-18 µM 
(approximately 7,000-22,000 ng/mL). However, these 
concentrations are well in excess of the estimated clinical 
maximum concentration (Cmax) of 0.1 µM (approximately 
120 ng/mL). Furthermore, in a rabbit Purkinje fibre assay, 
mix-ISA247 was not associated with the induction of 
arrhythmias at the concentration range tested (nominally 
0.01-10 µM). In vivo, voclosporin and/or mix ISA247 
lengthened QT and QTc intervals at a dose level of 200 
mg/kg, the highest dose tested, in cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology studies in conscious monkeys, but had no 
effect at lower doses. In these studies, no effects on heart 
rate were observed and the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
waveforms showed no effect on RR, PR and QRS complex 
duration. Exposure to voclosporin at a dose level of 200 
mg/kg in monkeys was approximately 8-fold and 5-fold 
higher than the estimated therapeutic exposure based on 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax, 
respectively. No drug-related ECG abnormalities were 
observed in any other non-rodent toxicology study 
including 14-day dog, 13-week dog, 13-week monkey and 
39-week monkey studies.  
 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies 
Nervous system 
Voclosporin did not have any effect on 
neuropharmacological signs in rats at doses up to 25 mg/kg.  
Respiratory system 
At a dose of 25 mg/kg (estimated clinical exposure multiple 
of 35-fold), the highest dose tested, voclosporin was 
associated with a slight transient decrease in respiration rate 
in rats, without an increase in tidal volume.  
Renal system 
The only acute effect of voclosporin in a rat renal study 
was a marginal decrease in urine volume at a dose of 
25 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
Relevance to human usage 
No safety concern relevant to human use has arisen 
from these non-clinical data. 
No safety concern relevant to human use has arisen 
from these non-clinical data. 
Renal effects: Nephrotoxicity (acute and chronic) 
is considered an Important Potential Risk. 
Other toxicity-related information or data 
Drug-Drug Interaction 
A 13-week combination toxicity study with voclosporin 
and prednisone was conducted in rats. There were no new 
toxic effects that occurred in rats administered voclosporin 
and prednisone in combination, compared to administration 
of each test article separately. The incidence of cataract 
formation was similar whether voclosporin was 
administered alone or in combination with prednisone. 
Small, but toxicologically insignificant, differences in 
temporal onset were observed. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 is the primary enzyme 
involved in the Phase 1 metabolism of voclosporin. A 
clinical drug interaction study with ketoconazole confirmed 
that voclosporin was a substrate for CYP3A4/5.  
In vitro drug interaction studies have shown that 
voclosporin is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 
without time-dependent or metabolism-dependent 
inhibition. 
In vitro studies have suggested that voclosporin may be a 
potential P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor at high 
concentrations (4 µM) and a potential substrate. 
Voclosporin interacted with human transporters organic-
anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) and OATP1B3. The results of 
the in vitro transporter studies suggest that voclosporin may 
cause pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions when 
co-administered with other drugs that are substrates of the 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters.  
Although voclosporin was shown to interact with the BCRP 
transporter in the BCRP-mediated vesicular transport 
inhibition assay, the calculated 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) value was greater than 10 μM, the 
highest concentration investigated. 
No safety concern relevant to human use has arisen 
from these non-clinical data. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC provides sufficient 
information regarding potential interactions such 
that interactions between voclosporin and 
medicinal products or herbal remedies known to 
inhibit or induce CYP3A4 do not constitute a safety 
concern for human use.  
Multiple administrations of voclosporin orally (0.4 
mg/kg BID) had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) if the sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate midazolam. There is no safety concern for 
human use. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC provides sufficient 
information regarding co-administration of 
voclosporin with sensitive P-gp substrates such that 
these interactions do not constitute a safety concern 
for human use. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC provides sufficient 
information regarding potential drug-drug 
interactions with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
substrates such that these interactions do not 
constitute a safety concern for human use. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC provides sufficient 
information regarding the potential for an 
interaction with BCRP substrates such that these 
interactions do not constitute a safety concern for 
human use.

Part II: Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure   
The clinical development program of voclosporin includes studies in four indications: LN, plaque 
psoriasis, non-infectious uveitis, and renal transplant.  
The LN clinical program was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of voclosporin when added to 
standard of care therapy with MMF (2 mg/day) and initial intravenous methylprednisolone pulse followed 
by oral prednisone at a daily dose of up to 25 mg which was then tapered to 2.5 mg over a period of 16 
weeks. When clinically indicated, patients could be completely titrated off oral corticosteroids. The entire 
clinical development program of voclosporin for all indications is described in Table 7.  
The exposure for the indication of LN in Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population) is 
described in Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11. This represents pooled LN data for 12 months of 
267 subjects in the voclosporin group and 266 subjects in the placebo group.  
AURORA 2 was a 2 year continuation study of AURORA 1 to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of 
116 subjects in the voclosporin group and 100 subjects in the placebo group. Table 12, Table 13, Table 14, 
and Table 15 present exposure data for AURORA 1 and AURORA 2 from Month 0 to Month 36. All 
studies are completed. Safety data is reported separately for AURORA 2 for the period Month 12 to 36.

Rationale 
There is no evidence of 
significant ECG safety 
concerns. Major Adverse 
Cardiovascular Events 
(MACEs) is considered to 
be an important potential 
risk. Studies in patients 
with severe cardiovascular 
disease would not be 
justified.  
The SmPC Section 4.2 
advises that in patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class A and B, 
respectively), the 
recommended starting dose 
is 15.8 mg BID. The effect 
of voclosporin in patients 
with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh 
Class C) has not been 
assessed and voclosporin is 
not recommended in this 
patient population.  
Studies in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment 
would not be justified. 
The safety profile in 
patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary 
disease or asthma requiring 
oral steroids is not expected 
to differ from the known 
safety profile. 
Use of voclosporin in this

The safety profile in 
patients with major 
physical or psychiatric 
illness or major traumatic 
injury is not expected to 
differ from the known 
safety profile. 
Not applicable 
Had current infection requiring IV 
antibiotics (AURA-LV and 
AURORA 1). 
Any overlapping autoimmune 
condition for which the condition 
or the treatment of the condition 
may have affected the study 
assessments or outcomes (e.g., 
scleroderma with significant 
pulmonary hypertension; any 
condition for which additional 
immunosuppression was 
indicated). 
Overlapping conditions for which 
the condition or treatment was not 
expected to affect assessments or 
outcomes (e.g., Sjogren’s 
syndrome) were not excluded 
(AURA-LV and AURORA 1). 
Other major physical or 
psychiatric illness or major 
traumatic injury within 6 months 
prior to screening (AURA-LV and 
AURORA 1). 
Patients who were pregnant, 
breast feeding or, if of 
childbearing potential, not using 
adequate contraceptive 
precautions. Patients had to agree 
to use adequate contraception (as 
defined in the protocol) during the 
study and for 1 month after the 
last dose of the study medication. 
• Two reliable forms of 
contraception were required to be 
used simultaneously unless 
abstinence was the chosen 
method. Effective contraception 
had to be used before beginning 
study medication, during study 
dosing, and 1 month following 
discontinuation of study dosing, 
even when there had been a 
history of infertility, unless due to 
hysterectomy (AURA-LV and 
AURORA 1). 
Criterion 
Reason for exclusion 
No vaccines using live organisms, 
virus or bacterial, were allowed 
during screening and while taking 
the study treatment (AURORA 1). 
Immunosuppressants may 
affect the response to 
vaccination and vaccination 
during treatment with 
voclosporin may be less 
effective.  
Is it 
considered to 
be included as 
missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale 
The SmPC (Section 4.4) 
states that the use of live 
attenuated vaccines should 
be avoided.   
SIV.2 
Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programmes  
From the clinical development programme adverse drug reactions with a frequency greater than 1 in 889 
would be detected if there were no background incidence.  
A total of 92 (79.3%) subjects have completed the 36 months study on treatment with voclosporin. There 
were no new-onset adverse events (AEs) that could be correlated with prolonged exposure or long-latency.  
PK analysis showed that there was no significant accumulation of voclosporin with repeated dosing.

Part II: Module SV - Post-authorisation experience    
Voclosporin (Lupkynis™) was approved in the US on 22 January 2021. As of 22 Jan 2022, an estimated 
 patients in the US have been prescribed voclosporin as part of their medical care (based on the number 
of  patients  who  have  had  a  prescription  dispensed).  Preliminary  reports  from  postmarketing  use  of 
voclosporin indicate that the safety profile remains consistent with that observed in clinical trials and there 
continues to be a favorable benefit / risk in patients with LN. 
 
 
Part II: Module SVI – Additional EU requirements for the safety specification       
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
There are no properties of voclosporin that would make it attractive for misuse for illegal purposes. 
 
 
 
Part II: Module SVII - Identified and potential risks  
SVII.1 
Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission  
SVII.1.1. Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP  
Risk 
CNI class effect  Voclosporin is structurally similar to CsA except for the modification of a functional group on 
Reason for not considered an important risk 
amino acid-1 of the molecule. Voclosporin exhibits some similar CNI class effects but is 
differentiated as a result of its higher potency and lower dose administration. 
Anaemia, and gingival hyperplasia are CNI class effects which occurred at a higher incidence 
in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm. These treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) had minimal clinical impact in relation to the severity of the indication, and a review 
of the seriousness, severity, treatment required, causality, plausibility and outcome did not 
support including these terms as important risks at this time.  
Diabetes and hyperglycaemia were not considered risks for voclosporin. Examination of 
TEAEs related to impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes indicates that there is no greater 
incidence of these types of events with voclosporin compared with placebo. TEAEs of 
diabetes (including exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes) were rare and occurred in both 
groups (2 events in placebo and 1 event in voclosporin, which was serious but considered 
unrelated to treatment). Hyperglycaemia was reported more often in the placebo group than 
the voclosporin group (1.5% vs 0.7% in the pooled LN population whilst in AURORA 2, it 
was reported in 0% in placebo v 0.9% in the voclosporin group. Diabetes and hyperglycaemia 
events are not considered an important risk for voclosporin.  
Clinical data do not show a signal for an increased risk of arrhythmias in patients with LN at a 
voclosporin dose level of 23.7 mg BID. After long term treatment with voclosporin in 
AURORA 2, the incidence of arrhythmias was lower in the voclosporin group compared with 
the placebo group. Section 5.1 of the SmPC provides information on two thorough QT 
studies. In addition, Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides information allowing the prescriber to 
identify circumstances which may increase the risk of QT prolongation. QT prolongation and 
arrhythmia are not considered to be important risks for voclosporin.  
Hypersensitivity  Contraindication. The incidence of hypersensitivity was similar between voclosporin and 
placebo treated subjects in the pooled LN population (21.0% vs 16.5%). The most common 
hypersensitivity events (as defined by the hypersensitivity standardised medical dictionary for 
regulatory activities query [SMQ]) were mouth ulceration (4.1% in voclosporin vs 1.1% in 
placebo), rash (3.0% vs 1.9%), erythema (1.9% vs 0.8%) and pruritis (1.5% vs 1.1%). More 
than 75% of the events were mild and none were severe. Very few events were considered 
related to study treatment (7 events in voclosporin vs 3 events in placebo) none of which were 
considered serious. One serious event of hypersensitivity occurred in each treatment arm (both 
were generalised oedema).  
In AURORA 2, the incidence of hypersensitivity was 16.4% in the voclosporin group 
compared to 6.0% in the placebo group). The most common hypersensitivity events (as 
defined by the hypersensitivity SMQ) were dermatitis (3.4% in voclosporin vs 0% in placebo) 
and rash (2.6% vs 2.0%). There were no severe events in either arm. Only one event was 
considered related to study treatment. This was an event of conjunctivitis in the voclosporin 
group. There were no serious events of hypersensitivity in either treatment arm. 
In relation to the severity of the indication treated, hypersensitivity is not considered an 
important risk as this time.   
 
 
 
SVII.1.2. Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP 
Serious Infections including opportunistic infections  
Important Identified Risks 
Scientific evidence 
for risk to be added in 
the safety 
specification 
Risk-benefit impact 
Clinical trials: The incidence of serious infections including opportunistic infections 
was marginally higher in the voclosporin group compared to the placebo group in the 
pooled LN population, In AURORA 2, the incidence was lower and comparable, 
between the two treatment arms indicating that the frequency of serious infection 
including opportunistic infections was higher in the first 12 months of treatment. 
Class effect: Like other immunosuppressants, CNIs predispose patients to the 
development of a variety of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral infections, often with 
opportunistic pathogens.  
Serious infections including opportunistic infections can have a significant impact on the 
patient. Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that immunosuppressants, including voclosporin, 
may increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, 
including opportunistic infections which may be serious or fatal and that patients must be 
monitored closely for infections during treatment with voclosporin. If an infection 
occurs, the benefit of continuing voclosporin should be assessed in consideration of the 
risk of continued administration. 
Major Adverse  Cardiovascular Events (MACEs) (see Annex 7 for MedDRA terms) 
Important Potential Risks 
Scientific evidence 
for risk to be added in 
the safety 
specification 
Risk-benefit impact 
Clinical trials: In the pooled LN population, the number of subjects with MACE TEAEs 
or treatment-emergent fatal cardiovascular events was low across both treatment groups: 
5 subjects in the placebo group had a TEAE meeting the MACE criteria compared with 4 
subjects in the voclosporin group. An analysis of exposure adjusted incidence rates 
(EAIRs) of TEAEs did not show any statistically significant differences between 
treatment groups and the overall EAIR was higher in the placebo group compared with 
the voclosporin group. In AURORA 2 there were no MACE TEAEs in the voclosporin 
group and one MACE TEAE of pulmonary embolism in the placebo group.  
Hypertension is a risk factor for MACEs. In the pooled LN population, hypertension, 
including treatment related hypertension, occurred more frequently in the voclosporin 
group compared to placebo. In AURORA 2, the frequency was lower and comparable 
between the two groups indicating that the frequency of hypertension was higher in the 
first 12 months of treatment. The majority of events in the voclosporin and placebo 
groups in the pooled LN and AURORA 2 populations were mild or moderate.  
Class effect: As a class, CNIs induce hypertension which is a risk factor for MACEs.  
MACEs can be serious and fatal if not treated.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further monitor the risk of MACE with respect 
to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors, including patient history. 
Advice on how to minimise the risk of hypertension, a risk factor for MACE, 
disseminated through routine risk minimisation measures and the appropriate labelling 
will provide information to ensure that the benefit-risk for the product remains positive. 
Neurotoxicity (Nervous System Disorders SOC) 
Scientific evidence 
for risk to be added in 
the safety 
specification 
Clinical trials: In the pooled LN population, TEAEs in the Nervous System Disorders 
SOC occurred at a higher rate in the voclosporin group than in the placebo group. 
However, the Nervous System Disorders SOC contains some terms which are not 
indicative of neurotoxicity. Six preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the 
voclosporin group ≥ 1% higher than placebo (headache, tremor, post-herpetic neuralgia, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and seizure); the remaining events occurred either at a lower 
incidence in voclosporin compared with placebo or occurred in only 1 or 2 subjects in 
any treatment group. In AURORA 2, Nervous System Disorder TEAEs occurred more 
frequently in the voclosporin treated patients compared to the placebo group. Three 
 
Risk-benefit impact 
preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the voclosporin group ≥ 1% higher than 
placebo (headache, hypoaesthesia and dizziness) 
Class effect: CNIs have been associated with hypertensive encephalopathy and PRES 
(Farouk et al, 2020). 
Neurotoxicity including PRES can be serious and fatal if not treated. Most cases of 
PRES resolve over days to weeks without complications, however, death and permanent 
neurologic disability can occur from cerebral oedema either from intracranial 
haemorrhage or the disease itself (Farouk et al, 2020). 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further monitor the risk of neurotoxicity with 
respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors, including patient 
history. 
Advice on how to minimise the risk of neurotoxicity is disseminated through routine risk 
minimisation measures and the appropriate labelling will provide information to ensure 
that the benefit-risk for the product remains positive. 
Nephrotoxicity (acute [Acute renal failure SMQ] and chronic [Chronic kidney disease SMQ]) 
Scientific evidence 
for risk to be added in 
the safety 
specification 
Risk-benefit impact 
Non-clinical: In a single dose renal safety pharmacology study with voclosporin in rats, 
there was a marginal effect on renal function (i.e., a 25% decrease in urine volume at the 
highest dose tested, 25 mg/kg). 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, renal effects included increases in blood urea 
nitrogen and creatinine, tubular basophilia and degeneration/regeneration, and 
corticomedullary mineralization. It is unclear whether all of the renal findings are 
directly treatment-related or whether exposure to voclosporin or CsA exacerbated normal 
biological processes since the observed renal changes can arise spontaneously in male 
rats, especially as they age. In dogs, no renal effects were noted. 
Clinical trials: There has been no indication of true voclosporin-related events 
suggestive of nephrotoxicity in the clinical development program with treatment up to 
three years. LN causes a loss of renal function which is manifest by a decreasing eGFR 
and an increase in urine protein/creatinine ration (UPCR). In addition, voclosporin has a 
haemodynamic effect leading to a small decrease in eGFR which is reversible on 
stopping treatment. 
Data from the long-term AURORA 2 trial supports the lack of nephrotoxicity of 
voclosporin over a 3-year period. An assessment of eGFR levels over time from the start 
of AURORA 2 shows that mean eGFR levels were generally stable from Month 12 to 
Month 27 after which point the mean eGFR levels in the voclosporin group increased 
while those in the placebo group decreased, potentially reflecting a worsening of renal 
function relating to disease progression in some placebo subjects.  
Class effect: Renal toxicity, associated with CNIs, is reported most frequently in kidney 
transplant recipients (Issa et al, 2013; Naesens et al, 2009). While chronic nephrotoxicity 
has been observed at levels of CNI suppression needed in organ transplantation, the level 
of suppression at the voclosporin dose proposed for LN (23.7 mg BID) is lower than that 
generally required in transplantation. At a dose of voclosporin of 23.7 mg BID, 
calcineurin inhibition has been determined to be 15.7% at the pre-dose trough 
concentration (Ctrough ) and 58.1% at Cmax. In contrast, the trough concentration of CNI 
suppression in patients treated with CsA undergoing renal transplant has been reported to 
be 68% (Halloran et al, 1999).  
Based upon the clinical trial data of voclosporin treatment for up to 3 years, there is no 
indication of an association between voclosporin and acute or chronic nephrotoxicity. 
Reports are confounded by the indication and overall, there was an improvement in renal 
function in patients treated with voclosporin compared to placebo. Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC recommends establishing a baseline eGFR before starting treatment with 
voclosporin and assessing eGFR every two weeks for the first month, and every four 
weeks thereafter. Dose adjustments are required for those individuals whose eGFR is 
confirmed to be reduced (i.e., two consecutive assessments within 48 hours) and below 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Details of appropriate dose adjustments are provided in Section 4.2. 
If eGFR remains ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 no dose modification is required. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC explains that cases of acute and chronic renal toxicity have been 
reported in patients treated with other calcineurin-inhibitors. Adverse events of acute 
worsening of renal function or eGFR decreases have been seen in patients treated with 
voclosporin, which can be managed by dose modification. In the first four weeks of 
treatment with voclosporin, haemodynamic reductions in eGFR have been observed. 
Regular monitoring of eGFR levels is recommended. 
In addition, chronic nephrotoxicity has been observed at levels of CNI suppression 
needed in organ transplantation. The level of CNI suppression of voclosporin in LN is 
lower than that generally required in organ transplantation. 
Malignancies (including lymphomas) associated with long term use (Malignancies SMQ)

for risk to be added in 
the safety 
specification 
Risk-benefit impact 
Use in pregnancy  
Reason for missing 
information to be 
added in the safety 
specification 
Risk-benefit impact 
Non-clinical: Daily oral gavage of voclosporin for 60 to 89 weeks to mice was 
associated with higher incidences of malignant lymphoma in the high-dose males 
(30 mg/kg/day) when compared with the saline control, but not with the vehicle control, 
and in the high-dose females (30 mg/kg/day) when compared with the vehicle control, 
but not the saline control. 
Clinical trials: There has been no indication of malignancy events related to voclosporin 
in the clinical development program over the three -year period. 
Class effect: Like other immunosuppressants, CNIs increase the risk of developing 
lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin.  
Malignancies are serious conditions that can be life-threatening. However, there is 
insufficient evidence to confirm a causal association between voclosporin therapy and 
malignancies (including lymphoma). Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides a general 
statement that immunosuppressants increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other 
malignancies, particularly of the skin and patients should be advised to avoid or limit 
unprotected exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light. 
Missing Information 
Non-clinical: Foetal toxicity (reduced foetal body weights and skeletal variations) was 
only observed at doses associated with maternal toxicity (based on swollen mammary 
glands, reduced body weights, clinical observations and food consumption effects). 
Voclosporin was not teratogenic. 
Clinical trials: Subjects who were pregnant were excluded from the clinical trials. 
However, there have been 19 reports of pregnancy in the whole clinical development 
program (including all studies in other indications):  
• 
• 
9 in a female partner of a male patient exposed to voclosporin 
10 in female patients exposed to voclosporin 
Outcomes were 7 live births, 2 spontaneous abortions, 5 induced abortions and 5 
unknown (lost to follow-up). 
Use in pregnancy is considered as Missing Information due to the small amount of data 
on exposure in pregnancy. 
Voclosporin is not teratogenic based on non-clinical data however, it was given with 
other medications that might induce embryofoetal toxicity. Available data on use of 
voclosporin in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there is a drug-
associated embryofoetal toxicity. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC states that there is no or limited amount of data (less than 300 
pregnancy outcomes) from the use of voclosporin in pregnant women and animal studies 
have shown reproductive toxicity. Voclosporin is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of child-bearing potential not using contraception.

Study AURORA 2 (Safety population [N=216]) 
Events for serious infections including opportunistic infections include all serious 
events in the Infections and Infestations SOC and a wide search criteria for 
opportunistic infections.  
Events of serious infections including opportunistic infection occurred in 12.1% 
of the voclosporin treated patients compared to 13% in the placebo group (Table 
19 and Table 20).  
Of the 15 events that occurred in the voclosporin group:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
4 were considered related to treatment;  
13 were resolved  
7 led to dose modification  
1 led to permanent study drug discontinuation.  
Of the 19 events that occurred in the placebo group: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
4 were considered related to treatment  
13 were resolved  
8 led to dose modification  
4 led to permanent study drug discontinuation

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients who are using immunosuppressive treatment of any kind have an increased 
risk of serious infections including opportunistic infection. 
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
Section 4.4 of SmPC states that immunosuppressants, including voclosporin, may 
increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, 
including opportunistic infections which may be serious or fatal, and that patients 
must be monitored closely for infections during treatment with voclosporin. If an 
infection occurs, the benefit of continuing voclosporin should be assessed in 
consideration of the risk of continued administration. 
Serious infections including opportunistic infections in general can be serious and 
fatal if not treated.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further monitor the risk of serious infections 
including opportunistic infections with respect to number of reports, seriousness, 
outcome, and risk factors, including patient history. 
Advice on how to minimise the risk of serious infections including opportunistic 
infections is disseminated through routine risk minimisation measures and the 
appropriate labelling will provide information to ensure that the benefit-risk for the 
product remains positive. 
Public health impact 
Minimal due to the limited number of patients with the specific indication and rarity 
of occurrence. 
 
 
 
Important potential risk: MACE  
Potential mechanism 
CNIs induce hypertension by vasoconstriction, sympathetic excitation and sodium 
retention by the kidney. The vasoconstrictive effects of CNIs are related to 
interference with the balance of vasoactive substances, including endothelin and nitric 
oxide (NO). CNIs increase the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride 
cotransporter through an effect on the lysine deficient protein kinase 1 and sucrose- 
phosphase synthase-1 (SPS1)-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (Hoorn et al, 2012). 
Hypertension is a contributing factor in the development of MACEs.  
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
Clinical trials: In the pooled LN population, the number of subjects with MACE 
TEAEs or treatment-emergent fatal cardiovascular events was low across both 
treatment groups in the pooled LN population: 5 subjects in the placebo group had a 
TEAE meeting the MACE criteria compared with 4 subjects in the voclosporin group. 
An analysis of EAIRs of TEAEs did not show any statistically significant differences 
between treatment groups and the overall EAIR was higher in the placebo group 
compared with the voclosporin group. In AURORA 2 there were no MACE TEAEs in 
the voclosporin group and one MACE TEAE of pulmonary embolism in the placebo 
group.  
Hypertension is a risk factor for MACEs. In the pooled LN population, hypertension, 
including treatment related hypertension, occurred more frequently in the voclosporin 
group compared to placebo. In AURORA 2, the frequency was lower and comparable 
between the two groups indicating that the frequency of hypertension was higher in 
the first 12 months of treatment. The majority of events in the voclosporin and 
placebo groups in the pooled LN and AURORA 2 populations were mild or moderate. 
Class effect: As a class, CNIs induce hypertension which is a risk factor for MACEs.  
Characterisation of the 
risk: Frequency, 
relationship, and 
outcome 
Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population [N=533]) 
MedDRA search terms for MACEs were defined by clinical review of preferred terms 
with the addition of fatal pulmonary embolism and fatal cardiac disorder events. A 
full list of terms is provided in Annex 7.  
MACEs occurred in 1.5% of the voclosporin treated patients compared to 1.9% in the 
placebo group (Table 24 and Table 25). It should be noted that this includes 2 events 
of cerebrovascular accident and 1 of haemorrhagic stroke, occurring in the placebo 
group and 1 event of cerebral infarction which occurred in the voclosporin group and 
which have also been included in the neurotoxicity analysis.  
Of the 4 events that occurred in the voclosporin group: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
none were considered related to treatment  
2 resolved and 2 were fatal 
none led to dose modification  
none led to permanent discontinuation 
Of the 5 events that occurred in the placebo group: 
none were considered related to treatment  
2 were resolved and 1 was fatal.  
2 led to dose modification  
1 led to permanent discontinuation

Source: Table Q180_33.1.8 
Study AURORA 2 (Safety population [N=216]) 
In AURORA 2, the only MACE TEAE was in the placebo group and was severe.  
Source: Table Q180_33.2.8 
Patients with LN are a population at greater risk of experiencing cardiovascular AEs 
such as MACE due to inflammation, elevated blood lipids, antiphospholipid 
syndrome.  
Additionally, hypertension, obesity, smoking, diabetes, family history and lack of 
exercise are risk factors for MACE. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that blood pressure should be monitored every two 
weeks for the first month after initiating voclosporin and as clinically indicated 
thereafter. Advice is also provided as to management of clinically concerning elevated 
blood pressure and when to stop administration of voclosporin. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
MACE can be serious and fatal if not treated.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further monitor the risk of MACE with 
respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors, including patient 
history. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advice on how to minimise the risk of hypertension, a risk factor for MACE, 
disseminated through routine risk minimisation measures and the appropriate 
labelling, will provide information to ensure that the benefit-risk for the product 
remains positive. 
Public health impact 
Minimal due to the limited number of patients with the specific indication and rarity 
of occurrence. 
Important potential risk: Neurotoxicity 
Potential mechanism 
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
The exact mechanism of CNI associated neurotoxicity is not completely understood as 
CNIs are highly lipophilic and do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Proposed 
mechanisms include altered CNS permeability due to increased endothelin production 
as well as increased production of toxic free radicals resulting from CNI-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction (Farouk et al 2020). 
Clinical trials: In the pooled LN population, TEAEs in the Nervous System Disorders 
SOC occurred at a higher rate in the voclosporin group than in the placebo group. 
However, the Nervous System Disorders SOC contains some terms which are not 
indicative of neurotoxicity. Six preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the 
voclosporin group ≥ 1% higher than placebo (headache, tremor, post-herpetic 
neuralgia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and seizure); the remaining events occurred 
either at a lower incidence in voclosporin compared with placebo or occurred in only 
1 or 2 subjects in any treatment group. In AURORA 2, Nervous System Disorder 
TEAEs occurred more frequently in the voclosporin treated patients compared to the 
placebo group. Three preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the voclosporin 
group ≥ 1% higher than placebo (headache, hypoaesthesia and dizziness) 
 Class effect: CNIs have been associated with hypertensive encephalopathy and 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Farouk et al 2020). 
Characterisation of the 
risk: Frequency, 
relationship, and 
outcome 
Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population [N=533]) 
The MedDRA SOC of Nervous System Disorders was used as the search term for 
neurotoxicity.  
Events of nervous system disorder occurred in 27.7 % of the voclosporin treated 
patients compared to 16.5% in the placebo group (Table 27 and Table 28). It should 
be noted that this includes 2 events of cerebrovascular accident and 1 of haemorrhagic 
stroke, occurring in the placebo group and an event of cerebral infarction which 
occurred in the voclosporin group and have also been included in the MACE analysis.  
Of the 114 events that occurred in the voclosporin group: 
20 were considered related to treatment  
85 were resolved   
6 led to dose modification  
• 
• 
• 
• 
5 led to permanent discontinuation 
Of the 61 events that occurred in the placebo group: 
• 
• 
•

7 were considered related to treatment  
48 were resolved

There are no clear risk factors for neurotoxicity. However, the prevalence of PRES 
among patients with SLE ranges from 0.7% to 1.4% with recurrence in up to 15% of 
cases. Risk factors include SLE activity, hypertension, haematologic and renal disease 
(Valdez-Lopez 2021). Female gender, hypertension and exposure to 
immunosuppressive therapy and heroin consumption have been postulated as 
additional risk factors (Ansari 2021). 
Section 4.4 of SmPC states that patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies 
including voclosporin are at increased risk of neurotoxicity. Patients should be 
monitored for new-onset or worsening of neurological symptoms including seizures, 
tremors, or signs and symptoms suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES) and reduction or discontinuation of voclosporin should be 
considered if these occur.  
Neurotoxicity including PRES can be serious and fatal if not treated. Most cases of 
PRES resolve over days to weeks without complications, however, death and 
permanent neurologic disability can occur from cerebral oedema either from 
intracranial haemorrhage or the disease itself (Farouk 2020). 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further monitor the risk of neurotoxicity 
with respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors, including 
patient history. 
An EU PASS study will further characterise the risk of neurotoxicity in the post-
marketing setting.  
Advice on how to minimise the risk of neurotoxicity is disseminated through routine 
risk minimisation measures and the appropriate labelling will provide information to 
ensure that the benefit-risk for the product remains positive. 
 
 
 
 
Public health impact 
Minimal due to the limited number of patients with the specific indication and rarity 
of occurrence. 
Important potential risk: Nephrotoxicity (acute [Acute renal failure SMQ] and chronic [Chronic kidney 
disease SMQ]) 
Potential 
mechanism 
CNIs lead to activation of the renin angiotensin and endothelin systems and to increase of 
sympathetic nerve activity. In addition, CNIs are known to inhibit NO synthesis and NO-
mediated vasodilation, and also increase free radicals and superoxide production through 
vasoconstriction-associated hypoxia. Increased levels of intrarenal renin and angiotensin II 
induced by CNI are recognised as an important mechanism that contributes to nephrotoxicity. 
The direct effect of CNI on the tubular epithelial cells plays a major role in the development 
of interstitial fibrosis. Activation of renin-angiotensin system is not only important in terms of 
its haemodynamic contribution, but it also directly promotes renal interstitial fibrosis through 
profibrotic effect of transforming growth factor beta (Hošková et al, 2017).  
Evidence source 
and strength of 
evidence 
Characterisation 
of the risk: 
Frequency, 
relationship, and 
outcome 
Non-clinical: Toxicity studies in rats showed renal effects including increases in blood urea 
nitrogen and creatinine, tubular basophilia and degeneration/regeneration, and 
corticomedullary mineralization.  
Clinical trials:  
There has been no indication of true voclosporin events of nephrotoxicity in the clinical 
development program with treatment up to three years. LN causes a loss of renal function 
which is manifest by a decreasing eGFR and an increase in UPCR. In addition, voclosporin 
has a haemodynamic effect leading to a small decrease in eGFR which is reversible on 
stopping treatment. 
Data from the long-term AURORA 2 trial supports the lack of nephrotoxicity of voclosporin 
over a 3-year period. An assessment of eGFR levels over time from the start of AURORA 2 
shows that mean eGFR levels were generally stable from Month 12 to Month 27 after which 
point the mean eGFR levels in the voclosporin group increased while those in the placebo group 
decreased, potentially reflecting a worsening of renal function relating to disease progression in 
some placebo subjects.  
Class effect: Renal toxicity is a known effect of CNIs seen most frequently in kidney 
transplant recipients.  
Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population [N=533]) 
Nephrotoxicity is a very broad term which covers acute and chronic effects. Reversible 
decreases in eGFR are frequently seen in subjects treated with voclosporin due to the 
haemodynamic effect of the drug; these decreases in eGFR confound any assessment of renal 
toxicity using standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs), since changes in eGFR are the most 
common event that occurred in the search using the SMQs for Acute Renal Failure 
(SMQ20000003) and Chronic Kidney Disease (SMQ20000213).  
Renal toxicity events including eGFR decreased.  
Renal toxicity events, including GFR decreased, occurred in 35.6% of the voclosporin treated 
patients compared to 25.2 % in the placebo group (Table 35 and Table 36).  
Of the 160 renal toxicity events that occurred in the voclosporin group:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
90 were considered related to treatment 
92 were resolved  
106 led to dose modification  
21 led to permanent study drug discontinuation.

Renal toxicity events excluding eGFR decreased.  
In the pooled LN population (AURA-LV and AURORA 1), excluding eGFR decreases, the 
proportion of subjects who experienced renal toxicity events was lower in the voclosporin 
group than the placebo group: in the voclosporin group there were 36 subjects (13.5%) who 
experienced 48 events whilst the placebo group there were 42 subjects (15.8%) who 
experienced 53 events. 
Thus, the apparent renal toxicity of voclosporin is predominantly driven by the changes in 
eGFR rather than a true toxicity effect.  
Reversibility of renal toxicity events. 
The reversibility of the eGFR decreases was assessed in subjects who had at least one event of 
acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease or a confirmed eGFR decrease of ≥30%. This 
analysis showed that although slightly more voclosporin subjects (36.5%) than placebo 
subjects (30.9%) had at least one event of acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease or 
confirmed eGFR decrease of ≥30%, the proportion of subjects who recovered was higher in 
the voclosporin group (92.3%) compared with the placebo group (76.4%). Of the 5 
voclosporin subjects who did not recover, 4 were considered to be due to clear disease 
progression or LN flare and medication was discontinued in these subjects. This is not 
unexpected as, even with treatment, patients with LN progressively lose renal function over 
time.  
Study AURORA 2 (Safety population [N=216]) 
Renal toxicity events including eGFR decreased.  
Renal toxicity events including eGFR decreased occurred in 27.6% of the voclosporin treated 
patients compared to 17.0 % in the placebo group (Table 38 and Table 39).

Renal toxicity events excluding eGFR decreased.  
In AURORA 2, excluding eGFR decreases, the proportion of subjects who experienced renal 
toxicity events in the voclosporin group was 21 (18.1%) who experienced 26 events whilst in 
the placebo group there were 12 subjects (12.0%) who experienced 16 events. 
Lupus nephritis and proteinuria were reported at a higher frequency in the voclosporin group 
compared with the placebo group. Ten subjects (8.6%) experienced 11 LN events in the 
voclosporin group compared to 4 (4.0%) experiencing 4 events in the placebo group. Four 
(3.4%) subjects experienced 6 events of proteinuria compared to 1 (1.0%) experiencing 2 
events in placebo. It is likely that this reflects disease progression despite treatment. The 
apparent imbalance between the placebo and voclosporin groups reflects the fact that placebo 
subjects with LN or proteinuria were likely to have stopped treatment earlier in AURORA 1 
and hence did not enter AURORA 2. 
Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population [N=533]) 
Serious events of renal toxicity including eGFR decrease 
The incidence of serious renal toxicity events including eGFR decrease events was 5.2% and 
3.4% in the voclosporin treated patients and placebo, respectively (Table 41).  
Six of these in the voclosporin group resolved and three in the placebo group resolved. 
There was one serious event of eGFR decreased in both the voclosporin and the placebo arms.

All the treatment-related renal toxicity events were mild or moderate in both the voclosporin 
and placebo groups with no severe events. 
Source: Table Q1301_0409 
Patients with LN by definition have renal disease. Patients will continue to show progression 
of disease despite treatment and it has been estimated that as many as 30% of LN patients will 
progress to end-stage renal disease (Almaani et al 2017, Costenbader et al 2011, Tektonidou 
et al 2016).   
A cross-sectional observational study based on data from the Spanish Registry of 
Glomerulonephritis for the years 1994–2009 showed that risk factors associated with renal 
failure in patients with LN were older age, male gender, intensity of proteinuria, and presence 
of hypertension (Vozmediano et al, 2012). 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends establishing a baseline eGFR before starting treatment 
with voclosporin and assessing eGFR every two weeks for the first month, and every four 
weeks thereafter. Dose adjustments are required for those individuals whose eGFR is 
confirmed to be reduced (i.e., two consecutive assessments within 48 hours) and below 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Details of appropriate dose adjustments are provided in Section 4.2. If eGFR remains ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 no dose modification is required.  
Section 4.4 of the SmPC explains that as with other CNIs, adverse reactions of acute 
worsening of renal function or eGFR decreases have been seen in patients treated with 
voclosporin. In the first four weeks of treatment with voclosporin, haemodynamic reductions 
in eGFR have been observed and this can be managed by dose adjustments. Regular 
monitoring of eGFR levels is recommended. 
If the drug-induced renal events are not diagnosed and treated rapidly and adequately, 
complications potentially resulting in a fatal outcome may occur.  
 Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of renal effects with 
respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors and whether experience in 
the post marketing setting is consistent with the information already known for this risk from 
clinical trial data. 
An EU PASS study will further characterise the risk of chronic nephrotoxicity in the post-
marketing setting.  
AURORA 2 biopsy sub-study will provide further information regarding nephrotoxicity  
 
 
 
 
 
Advice on how to minimise the risk of nephrotoxicity is disseminated through routine risk 
minimisation measures and the appropriate labelling will provide information to ensure that 
the benefit-risk for the product remains positive. 
Public health 
impact 
Minimal due to the limited number of patients with the specific indication and the ability to 
manage the risk via routine risk minimisation activities. 
Important potential risk: Malignancies (including lymphomas) associated with long term use (Malignancies 
SMQ) 
Potential mechanism 
Immunosuppression predisposes patients to a variety of viral infections that lead to 
malignant transformations of different tissues. In addition, they may also have direct 
tumorigenic effects. CNIs can promote tumour growth through transforming growth 
factor-β production or induce tumour growth through overexpression of the 
angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, CNIs may lead to 
the activation of the Ras-Raf proteins pathway (Datta et al, 2009).  
Both drug-induced immunosuppression and an increase in tumour-driven regulatory 
T cells (Tregs) (i.e., migration and expansion of naturally occurring Tregs or conversion 
and expansion of induced Tregs) contribute to impaired immune surveillance and 
responses against cancer cells (Ducloux, 2014).  
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
Characterisation of the 
risk: Frequency, 
relationship, and 
outcome 
Non-clinical: Daily oral administration of voclosporin for 60 to 89 weeks to mice was 
associated with higher incidences of malignant lymphoma. 
Clinical trials: There has been no indication of malignancy events related to 
voclosporin in the clinical development program over the three-year period.  
Class effect: Like other immunosuppressants, CNIs increase the risk of developing 
lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin.  
Studies AURA-LV and AURORA 1 (Safety population [N=533]) 
Malignancy events occurred in 1.5% of the voclosporin treated patients compared to 
0% in the placebo group.  
The 4 events were breast tumour excision, cervix carcinoma Stage 0, neoplasm skin 
and pyoderma gangrenosum

Long-term immunosuppression. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that immunosuppressants increase the risk of 
developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin and patients 
should be advised to avoid or limit unprotected exposure to sunlight and UV light.  
Lymphoma and malignancies in general are serious conditions that can be life-
threatening.  
However, current data are insufficient to confirm or exclude the risk of malignancies 
associated with the use of voclosporin. All four malignancies were single occurrences 
and not considered related due to early onset in the short term study. Routine 
pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of lymphomas and 
malignancies associated with long term use with respect to number of reports, 
seriousness, outcome, and risk factors. 
An EU PASS study will further characterise the risk of malignancies in the post-
marketing setting.  
Advice on how to minimise the risk of malignancies is disseminated through routine 
risk minimisation measures and the appropriate labelling will provide information to 
ensure that the benefit-risk for the product remains positive.

of occurrence.

Population in need of further 
characterisation 
Pregnant subjects were excluded from clinical trials and thus there is no 
data regarding the safety profile in this population. 
The risk of use in pregnancy cannot be defined based on available data 
and thus the safety profile will be derived from routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.

1.Study short name and title: Kidney biopsy sub-study 
Rationale and Study Objectives  
The kidney biopsy is accepted as the gold standard for the diagnosis of glomerular diseases, and biopsy 
findings are used to classify and subgroup the forms of lupus nephritis (LN). Proteinuria is well accepted 
in regular clinical practice as a marker of treatment response and overall prognosis in LN. However, there 
is some data to suggest that renal biopsy provides additional information on renal status during LN 
treatment both via histology and more recent examination of renal protein and micro-RNA expression. 
Therefore, within the confines of a clinical trial and to provide more complete information on treatment 
effect this renal biopsy sub-study will assess renal histology and transcriptomics (proteomics may also be 
assessed if sufficient samples are available). 
The diagnosis of active LN relies on both clinical and histologic findings, with the goal of LN therapy 
being the achievement of a clinical response, assessed mainly as a reduction in proteinuria and 
stabilization or improvement in kidney function. However, there is poor correlation between clinical 
findings and renal histology and little progress has been made in using the kidney biopsy to predict 
treatment response. 
Study Design 
All subjects enrolled into the AURORA 1 study had a kidney biopsy prior to entry for confirmation of 
eligibility (Biopsy 1), and all subjects completing 52 weeks of treatment in AURORA 1 have the 
opportunity to continue with their randomized treatment into the AURORA 2 study. Subjects at sites in 
AURORA 2 that are able to meet the biopsy requirements, will be invited to participate in this biopsy sub-
study, with a repeat biopsy (Biopsy 2) performed within approximately the first 6 months after enrolment 
for subjects who consent. Kidney biopsies planned later than the first 6 months of treatment in this study 
may be permitted following discussions with the medical monitor prior to undertaking the procedure. 
Slides for both biopsies will be assessed centrally at two centres, one in the US (transcriptomics 
and proteomics if sufficient samples are available) and the other in Italy (histology and 
immune-markers).  
Participation in the sub-study does not affect the subjects continued treatment or follow-up in 
 
  
AURORA 2.

2.Study short name and title: An observational PASS in EU to further characterise and quantify 
long-term safety profile of Lupkynis. 
Rationale and study objectives  
In the EU, Lupkynis is anticipated to be indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the 
treatment of adult patients with active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus 
nephritis (LN). The Estimated prevalence of LN ranged from 0.63 to 2.28 per 10,000 persons. The Risk 
Management Plan for Lupkynis includes malignancy, neurotoxicity, and chronic nephrotoxicity as 
Important Potential Risks. The purpose of this PASS study is to assess the occurrence of these events in 
patients treated with Lupkynis in the real-world setting.  
Study design: 
The Market Authorisation Applicant is currently undertaking feasibility assessments to determine the most 
appropriate design for this study in order to meet the required objectives. The final design of this study 
will be determined once the results of feasibility assessments are available. The duration of recruitment to 
the study will be determined by market uptake of Lupkynis in Europe. It is planned to obtain up to 6 years 
of data from patients from the time of their initiating Lupkynis.  
 
 
 
Study population: 
The study population will consist of patients who have been prescribed Lupkynis as per normal clinical 
practice. Country selection will be determined based upon anticipated market uptake of Lupkynis in 
Europe. 
Milestones: 
•  Study protocol submission to the EMA: 3 months after the European Commission grants 
marketing authorisation for Lupkynis in the European Union (EU) 
•  Further milestones will be provided in the full protocol once the results of the feasibility 
assessment are available.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Lupkynis (voclosporin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lupkynis. The RMP details important risks of 
Lupkynis, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Lupkynis's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Lupkynis's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Lupkynis should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Lupkynis should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lupkynis's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lupkynis is indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of adult patients with 
active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN) (see SmPC for the 
full indication). It contains voclosporin as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Lupkynis’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Lupkynis’s  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s  webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lupkynis. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Lupkynis, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Lupkynis's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lupkynis is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Lupkynis are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as 
identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Lupkynis. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Serious infections including opportunistic infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Important potential risk: MACEs 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical trials: The incidence of serious infections including opportunistic 
infections was marginally higher in the voclosporin group compared to the 
placebo group in the pooled LN population, In AURORA 2, the incidence 
was lower and comparable, between the two treatment arms indicating that 
the frequency of serious infection including opportunistic infections was 
higher in the first 12 months of treatment. 
Class effect: Like other immunosuppressants, CNIs predispose patients to 
the development of a variety of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral 
infections, including opportunistic pathogens. 
Patients who are using immunosuppressive treatment of any kind have an 
increased risk of opportunistic infection. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4, 4.8.  
PL Section 2, 4  
Legal status: Prescription only medicine 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None 
Clinical trials: The number of subjects with MACE TEAEs or treatment-
emergent fatal cardiovascular events was low across both treatment groups 
in the pooled LN population: 5 subjects in the placebo group had a TEAE 
meeting the MACE criteria compared with 4 subjects in the voclosporin 
group. An analysis of exposure adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) of TEAEs 
did not show any statistically significant differences between treatment 
groups and the overall EAIR was higher in the placebo group compared 
with the voclosporin group. In AURORA 2 there were no MACE TEAEs 
 
 
in the voclosporin group and one MACE TEAE of pulmonary embolism in 
the placebo group.  
Hypertension is a risk factor for MACE. In the pooled LN population, 
hypertension, including treatment related hypertension, occurred more 
frequently in the voclosporin group compared to placebo. In AURORA 2, 
the frequency was lower and comparable between the two groups 
indicating that the frequency of hypertension was higher in the first 12 
months of treatment. The majority of events in the voclosporin and placebo 
groups in the pooled LN and AURORA 2 populations were mild or 
moderate.  
Class effect: As a class, CNIs induce hypertension which is a risk factor 
for MACE. 
Patients with LN are a population at greater risk of experiencing 
cardiovascular AEs such as MACEs due to inflammation, elevated blood 
lipids, antiphospholipid syndrome.  
Additionally, hypertension, obesity, smoking, diabetes, family history and 
lack of exercise are risk factors for MACEs.

Important potential risk: Neurotoxicity  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical trials: In the pooled LN population, TEAEs in the Nervous 
System Disorders SOC occurred at a higher rate in the voclosporin group 
than in the placebo group. However, the Nervous System Disorders SOC 
contains some terms which are not indicative of neurotoxicity. Six 
preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the voclosporin group ≥ 1% 
higher than placebo (headache, tremor, post-herpetic neuralgia, 
paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and seizure); the remaining events occurred 
either at a lower incidence in voclosporin compared with placebo or 
occurred in only 1 or 2 subjects in any treatment group. In AURORA 2, 
Nervous System Disorder TEAEs occurred more frequently in the 
voclosporin treated patients compared to the placebo group. Three 
preferred terms occurred with an incidence in the voclosporin group ≥ 1% 
higher than placebo (headache, hypoaesthesia and dizziness). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Class effect: CNIs have been associated with hypertensive encephalopathy 
and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Farouk et al 
2020). 
There are no clear risk factors for neurotoxicity. However, the prevalence 
of PRES among patients with SLE ranges from 0.7% to 1.4% with 
recurrence in up to 15% of cases. Risk factors include SLE activity, 
hypertension, haematologic and renal disease (Valdez-Lopez 2021). 
Female gender, hypertension and exposure to immunosuppressive therapy 
and heroin consumption have been postulated as additional risk factors 
(Ansari 2021).

Additional risk minimisation measures: 
An observational PASS in EU to further characterise and quantify long-
term safety profile of Lupkynis 
Important potential risk: Nephrotoxicity (acute and chronic) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Non-clinical: Toxicity studies in rats showed renal effects including 
increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, tubular basophilia and 
degeneration/regeneration, and corticomedullary mineralization.  
Clinical trials: There has been no indication of true voclosporin-related 
nephrotoxicity in the clinical development program with treatment up to 
three years. LN causes a loss of renal function which is manifest by a 
decreasing eGFR and an increase in UPCR. In addition, voclosporin has a 
haemodynamic effect leading to a small decrease in eGFR which is 
reversible on stopping treatment. 
Data from the long-term AURORA 2 trial supports the lack of 
nephrotoxicity of voclosporin over a 3-year period. An assessment of 
eGFR levels over time from the start of AURORA 2 shows that mean 
eGFR levels were generally stable from Month 12 to Month 27 after which 
point the mean eGFR levels in the voclosporin group increased while those 
in the placebo group decreased, potentially reflecting a worsening of renal 
function relating to disease progression in some placebo subjects.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Class effect: Renal toxicity is a known effect of CNIs seen most frequently 
in kidney transplant recipients. 
Patients with LN by definition have renal disease.  
A cross-sectional observational study based on data from the Spanish 
Registry of Glomerulonephritis for the years 1994–2009 showed that risk 
factors associated with renal failure in patients with LN were older age, 
male gender, intensity of proteinuria, and presence of hypertension.

AURORA 2 biopsy sub-study 
Important potential risk: Malignancies (including lymphomas) associated with long term use 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Non-clinical: Daily oral administration of voclosporin for 60 to 89 weeks 
to mice was associated with higher incidences of malignant lymphoma. 
Clinical trials: There has been no indication of malignancy events related 
to voclosporin in the clinical development programme over the three year 
period.  
Class effect: Like other immunosuppressants, CNIs increase the risk of 
developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the 
skin.

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
Lupkynis. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
1.Study short name and title: Kidney biopsy sub-study 
Rationale and Study Objectives  
The kidney biopsy is accepted as the gold standard for the diagnosis of glomerular diseases, and biopsy 
findings are used to classify and subgroup the forms of lupus nephritis (LN). Proteinuria is well accepted 
in regular clinical practice as a marker of treatment response and overall prognosis in LN. However, there 
is some data to suggest that renal biopsy provides additional information on renal status during LN 
treatment both via histology and more recent examination of renal protein and micro-RNA expression. 
Therefore, within the confines of a clinical trial and to provide more complete information on treatment 
effect this renal biopsy sub-study will assess renal histology and transcriptomics (proteomics may also be 
assessed if sufficient samples are available). 
The diagnosis of active LN relies on both clinical and histologic findings, with the goal of LN therapy 
being the achievement of a clinical response, assessed mainly as a reduction in proteinuria and 
stabilization or improvement in kidney function. However, there is poor correlation between clinical 
findings and renal histology and little progress has been made in using the kidney biopsy to predict 
treatment response. 
2.Study short name and title: An observational PASS in EU to further characterise and quantify 
long-term safety profile of Lupkynis. 
Rationale and study objectives  
In the EU, Lupkynis is anticipated to be indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the 
treatment of adult patients with active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus 
 
 
 
nephritis (LN). The Estimated prevalence of LN ranged from 0.63 to 2.28 per 10,000 persons. The Risk 
Management Plan for Lupkynis includes malignancy, neurotoxicity, and chronic nephrotoxicity as 
Important Potential Risks. The purpose of this PASS study is to assess the occurrence of these events in 
patients treated with Lupkynis in the real-world setting.

4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Quofenix is indicated for the treatment of  the following infections in adults: 
•  acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) 
•  community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended 
for the initial treatment of these infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 300 mg delafloxacin every 12 hours administered over 60 minutes by 
intravenous infusion. Switch to delafloxacin 450 mg tablet orally every 12 hours is possible at the 
discretion of the physician. The total duration of treatment is 5 to 14 days for ABSSSI and 5 to 10 
days for CAP. 
Special population 
Elderly 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is required. As per fluoroquinolone class patients aged over 60 years are at 
increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCl of ≥30 
mL/min). Dosing in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl of <30 mL/min) should be decreased 
to 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours; alternatively patients should receive 450 mg delafloxacin 
orally every 12 hours (see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Quofenix is not recommended in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Quofenix is contraindicated in children and adolescents  (see section 4.3). 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to any fluoroquinolone or quinolone antibacterial medicinal product. 
Previous history of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone administration.  
Pregnancy, women of childbearing potential not using contraception and breast-feeding (see section 
4.6). 
Children or growing adolescents below 18 years of age (see section 4.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The use of delafloxacin should be avoided in patients who have experienced serious adverse reactions 
in the past when using quinolone or fluoroquinolone containing products (see section 4.8). Treatment 
of these patients with delafloxacin should only be initiated in the absence of alternative treatment 
options and after careful benefit/risk assessment (see also section 4.3). 
Contraception 
If women of a sexually mature age are treated, effective contraception must be used during treatment 
(see section 4.6). 
Aortic dissection and aneurysm, and heart valve regurgitation/incompetence 
Epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection, particularly in 
elderly patients, and of aortic and mitral valve regurgitation after intake of fluoroquinolones. 
Cases of aortic aneurysm and dissection, sometimes complicated by rupture (including fatal ones), and 
of regurgitation/incompetence of any of the heart valves have been reported in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolones (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, fluoroquinolones should only be used after careful benefit-risk assessment and after 
consideration of other therapeutic options in patients with positive family history of aneurysm disease 
or congenital heart valve disease, or in patients diagnosed with pre-existing aortic aneurysm and/or 
aortic dissection or heart valve disease, or in presence of other risk factors or conditions predisposing  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
for both aortic aneurysm and dissection and heart valve regurgitation/incompetence (e.g. 
connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner 
syndrome, Behcet’s disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis) or additionally 
for aortic aneurysm and dissection (e.g. vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis or giant 
cell arteritis, or known atherosclerosis, or Sjögren’s syndrome) or additionally 
for heart valve regurgitation/incompetence (e.g. infective endocarditis). 
The risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection, and their rupture may also be increased in patients treated 
concurrently with systemic corticosteroids. 
In case of sudden abdominal, chest or back pain, patients should be advised to immediately consult a 
physician in an emergency department. 
Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention in case of acute dyspnoea, new onset 
of heart palpitations, or development of oedema of the abdomen or lower extremities. 
Tendinitis and tendon rupture 
Tendinitis and tendon rupture (especially but not limited to Achilles tendon), sometimes bilateral, may 
occur as early as within 48 hours of starting treatment with quinolones and fluoroquinolones and have 
been reported to occur even up to several months after discontinuation of treatment. The risk of 
tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in older patients, patients with renal impairment, patients 
with solid organ transplants, and those treated concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, 
concomitant use of corticosteroids should be avoided. At the first sign of tendinitis (e.g. painful 
swelling, inflammation) the treatment with delafloxacin should be discontinued and alternative 
treatment should be considered. The affected limb(s) should be appropriately treated (e.g. 
immobilisation). Corticosteroids should not be used if signs of tendinopathy occur (see section 4.8). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Cases of sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy resulting in paraesthesia, hypaesthesia, dysesthesia, 
or weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and fluoroquinolones. Patients under 
treatment with delafloxacin should be advised to inform their doctor prior to continuing treatment if 
symptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop in order to 
prevent the development of potentially irreversible condition (see section 4.8). 
Central nervous system effects 
Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) 
reactions, including: convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) 
and toxic psychosis. Fluoroquinolones may also cause CNS reactions of nervousness, agitation, 
insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, paranoia, dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and 
suicidal thoughts or acts. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions 
occur in patients receiving delafloxacin, delafloxacin should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate measures should be instituted. Delafloxacin should be used when the benefits of treatment 
exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g. severe cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or 
lower the seizure threshold. 
Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis 
Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in 
persons with myasthenia gravis. Post-marketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and 
requirement for ventilator support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with 
myasthenia gravis. The use of delafloxacin is not recommended in patients with known history of 
myasthenia gravis. 
Clostridioides difficile-associated disease 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clostridioides difficile-associated disease has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial 
medicinal products, with severity ranging from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. Clostridioides difficile-
associated disease must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhoea. If Clostridioides 
difficile-associated disease is suspected or confirmed treatment with delafloxacin should be 
discontinued and appropriate supportive measures together with the specific antibacterial treatment of 
C. difficile should be considered. 
Medicinal products inhibiting the peristalsis are contraindicated if Clostridioides difficile-associated 
disease is suspected. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients with known hypersensitivity to delafloxacin or other fluoroquinolones must not take Quofenix 
(see section 4.3). Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been 
reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicinal products. Before initiating 
therapy with Quofenix, careful inquiry should be made about previous hypersensitivity reactions to 
other quinolone or fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicinal products. If an anaphylactic reaction to 
Quofenix occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy 
should be instituted. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is needed in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
The safety and efficacy of the dose adjustment guidance in patients with severe renal impairment has 
not been clinically evaluated and is based on pharmacokinetic modelling data. Delafloxacin should 
only be used in such patients when it is considered that the expected clinical benefit outweighs the 
potential risk. Clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these 
patients. 
Accumulation of the intravenous vehicle sulfobutylbetadex sodiumoccurs in patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment; therefore serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these 
patients, and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to switch to Quofenix 450 mg tablet 
every 12 hours. 
Quofenix is not recommended in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). 
Limitations of the clinical data 
In the two major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis/erysipelas, 
abscesses and wound infections only. Other types of skin infections have not been studied. Patients 
with toxic shock, neutropenia (neutrophil counts < 500 cells/mm3) or severely immunocompromised 
patients were not included in the studies. There is limited experience in patients aged > 75 years. 
However, the CAP population was older than the one studied in ABSSSI (48.3 % of subjects were ≥ 
65 years and 23.9% ≥ 75 years). In the CAP study 90.7% of patients had CURB-65 score of  ≤2. 
However 69.3% of patients were categorised to PORT class III and 30.7% of patients had a PORT 
score >III. 
Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse drug reactions 
Very rare cases of prolonged (continuing months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible 
serious adverse drug reactions affecting different, sometimes multiple, body systems (musculoskeletal, 
nervous, psychiatric and senses) have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and 
fluoroquinolones irrespective of their age and pre-existing risk factors. Delafloxacin should be 
discontinued immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction and patients 
should be advised to contact their prescriber for advice. 
Superinfection 
Fluoroquinolone non-susceptible microorganisms may result in superinfection with the use of 
delafloxacin. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dysglycaemia 
As with all quinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia have been reported (see section 4.8), usually in diabetic patients receiving 
concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic agent (e.g., glibenclamide) or with insulin. Cases 
of hypoglycaemic coma have been reported. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose 
is recommended. 
There are no data available on severe cases of hypoglycaemia resulting in coma or death after 
delafloxacin use. 
Serious bullous skin reactions 
Cases of bullous skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have 
been reported with other fluoroquinolones. Patients should be advised to contact their doctor 
immediately prior to continuing treatment if skin and/or mucosal reactions occur. 
Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 
Patients with a family history of, or actual glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are prone to 
haemolytic reactions when treated with other quinolones. Therefore, delafloxacin should be used with 
caution in these patients. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains sulfobutylbetadex sodium. In patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment, accumulation of cyclodextrins occurs. 
This medicinal product contains 175 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 8.8% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on delafloxacin 
There are no available data concerning specific effects of other medicinal products on delafloxacin. 
Known fluoroquinolones-associated possible interactions shall be considered. 
Effect of delafloxacin on other medicinal products 
Chelation active substance: antacids, sucralfate, metal cations, multivitamins 
There are no data concerning an interaction of intravenous delafloxacin with multivitamins, 
didanosine, or metal cations. However, delafloxacin should not be co-administered with any solution 
containing multivalent cations, e.g. magnesium, through the same intravenous line (see section 4.2 and 
6.2). 
Based on in vitro data on metabolising enzymes and transporters delafloxacin possesses a low 
potential to alter the disposition of other medicinal products (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
delafloxacin. 
Pregnancy 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of delafloxacin in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). In the absence of human data and findings 
in non-clinical studies at human therapeutic exposures, delafloxacin is contraindicated during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether delafloxacin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of 
delafloxacin/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment with delafloxacin. 
Fertility 
The effects of delafloxacin on fertility in humans have not been studied. Nonclinical studies conducted 
with delafloxacin in rats do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility or reproductive 
performance (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Quofenix has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some adverse drug 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, headache, visual disorders) may impair the patient's ability to concentrate and 
react, and therefore may constitute a risk in situations where the patient operates an automobile or 
machinery or engages in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions reported in ABSSSI (Phase 2 and 3 studies) and CAP 
(Phase 3 study) involving a total of 1,297 patients (868 subjects in acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infections and 429 subjects in community-acquired pneumonia), exposed to delafloxacin 
intravenous or oral formulation, were diarrhoea, nausea and hypertransaminasaemia (5.86%, 5.47% 
and 2.85% respectively) which were mild to moderate in intensity. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified in four comparative ABSSSI Phase 2 and 3 
studies and in one CAP Phase 3 study classified by preferred term and System Organ Class, and by

Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
* Very rare cases of prolonged (up to months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible serious 
drug reactions affecting several, sometimes multiple, system organ classes and senses (including 
reactions such as tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, 
neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, fatigue, memory impairment, sleep disorders, 
and impairment of hearing, vision, taste and smell) have been reported in association with the use of 
quinolones and fluoroquinolones in some cases irrespective of pre-existing risk factors (see section 
4.4). 
** Cases of aortic aneurysm and dissection, sometimes complicated by rupture (including fatal ones), 
and of regurgitation/incompetence of any of the heart valves have been reported in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolones (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest daily intravenous dose administered in clinical studies was 1200 mg; the patients who 
receive this dose did not have any adverse drug reactions or notable clinical laboratory test findings 
during the study. Treatment of overdose with delafloxacin should consist of observation and general 
supportive measures.

Mechanism of action 
Delafloxacin inhibits bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), enzymes 
required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. 
Resistance 
Resistance to fluoroquinolones, including delafloxacin, can occur due to mutations in defined regions 
of the target bacterial enzymes topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase referred to as Quinolone-Resistance 
Determining Regions (QRDRs), or through other resistance mechanisms such as efflux mechanisms. 
Cross-resistance between delafloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may be observed, although some 
isolates resistant to other fluoroquinolone may retain susceptibility to delafloxacin. 
Susceptibility testing breakpoints 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for delafloxacin are as follows: 
Organism  
Staphylococcus aureus (ABSSSI) 
Staphylococcus aureus (CAP) 
Streptococcus pneumoniae

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Quofenix in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of local infections of skin and 
subcutaneous tissues and community-acquired pneumonia (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following intravenous use of 300 mg delafloxacin every 12 hours, steady state concentrations are 
achieved after approximately 3-5 days with about 10% accumulation after multiple administrations. 
The half-life of IV delafloxacin is approximately 10 hours. Delafloxacin pharmacokinetic is 
comparable in patients with ABSSSI or CAP and healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
Peak plasma delafloxacin concentrations are achieved at the end of the 1 hour intravenous infusion. 
The 300-mg IV formulation and 450 mg tablet are bioequivalent with regard to total exposure (AUC). 
Distribution 
The steady state volume of distribution of delafloxacin is about 40 L which approximates total body 
water. The plasma protein binding of delafloxacin is approximately 84%; it primarily binds to 
albumin. Plasma protein binding of delafloxacin is not significantly affected by the degree of renal 
impairment. 
Following IV administration of 7 doses of 300 mg of delafloxacin to 30 healthy volunteers, the mean 
delafloxacin AUC0-12 (3.6 hr*µg/mL) in alveolar macrophages was 83% of the free-plasma  
AUC0-12, and the mean delafloxacin AUC0-12 (2.8 hr*µg/mL) in epithelial lining fluid was 65% of the 
free-plasma AUC0-12. 
Biotransformation 
Glucuronidation of delafloxacin is the primary metabolic pathway with oxidative metabolism 
representing <1% of an administered dose. The glucuronidation of delafloxacin is mediated mainly by 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
UGT1A1,UGT1A3 and UGT2B15. Unchanged parent drug is the predominant component in plasma. 
There are no significant circulating metabolites (mean=9.6%) in humans. 
 In vitro data indicate that delafloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations does not inhibit 
cytochrome P450 CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 
and CYP3A4/5 nor UDP glucuronosyltransferases isoforms UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Delafloxacin 
does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5. 
Likewise at clinically relevant concentrations delafloxacin does not inhibit the transporters MDR1, 
BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K and BSEP. 
Delafloxacin is a probable substrate of BCRP. 
Elimination 
After single intravenous dose of 14C-labeled delafloxacin, 65% of the radioactivity is excreted in the 
urine and 28% is excreted in the faeces. Delafloxacin is excreted both unchanged and as glucuronide 
metabolites in urine. The radioactivity recovered from faeces is unchanged delafloxacin. 
Obese patients (≥ 30 kg/m2 BMI) 
Pharmacokinetic parameters are not altered in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). 
Hepatic impairment  
No clinically meaningful changes in delafloxacin Cmax and AUC∞ were observed, following 
administration of a single 300 mg intravenous dose of delafloxacin into patients with mild, moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) compared to matched healthy control 
subjects. 
Renal impairment 
Following single intravenous (300 mg) administration to patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment or ESRD on haemodialysis with and without haemodialysis after dosing, mean total 
exposure (AUCt) were 1.3, 1.7, 2.1, 3.5 and 4.1-fold higher than values for matched control subjects. 
Peak concentrations for the mild and moderate renal impairment patients were similar to that of 
healthy subjects, whereas peak concentrations were 2.1-fold, 5.9-fold and 6.4-fold higher for patients 
with severe renal impairment and ESRD on haemodialysis with and without haemodialysis after 
dosing, respectively. 
In patients with moderate, or severe renal impairment or ESRD on haemodialysis, accumulation of the 
intravenous vehicle sulfobutylbetadex sodium occurs. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) increased 
2.2-fold, 5.3-fold, 8.5-fold and 29.8-fold for patients with moderate impairment, severe impairment 
and ESRD with and without haemodialysis after dosing, respectively compared to the normal control 
group. The mean peak exposure (Cmax) increased about 2-fold, 5-fold and 7-fold for patients with 
severe impairment and ESRD with and without haemodialysis after dosing, respectively compared to 
the normal control group. 
For dosing instructions in subjects with renal impairment refer to section 4.2. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of delafloxacin is not significantly altered with age; therefore, dose adjustment 
is not necessary based on age. 
Paediatric population 
No clinical trials have been conducted with delafloxacin in paediatric patients. 
Gender

Clinically significant gender-related differences in delafloxacin pharmacokinetics have not been 
observed in healthy subjects or in patients with ABSSSI or CAP. No dose adjustment is recommended 
based on gender. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, gastrointestinal effects were the main findings: these 
included dilated cecum (oral only), abnormal stool, and decreased food intake and / or body weight in 
rats, and emesis, salivation and abnormal stool / diarrhoea in dogs. In addition increases in serum ALT 
and ALP, and reduced total protein and globulin values were recorded at the end of the treatment 
period in the pivotal 4-week IV dog study at the high dose (75 mg/kg) in individual dogs. Importantly, 
gastrointestinal effects and slightly elevated liver enzymes in dogs were not associated with 
histopathological changes of gastrointestinal and annexed tissues (pancreas, liver). No adverse effects 
were seen in rats at exposures about 2-fold higher than humans, or in dogs at exposures approximately 
equal to humans. 
In embryo-fetal development studies carried out in rats and rabbits, delafloxacin was devoid of 
teratogenic effects but induced foetal growth retardation and ossification delays at levels of dose 
producing maternal toxicity. In rats foetal effects occurred at a level of exposure exceeding about 2-
fold that observed in humans based on the AUC, but in rabbits, a species known to be extremely 
sensitive to maternal toxicity of antibacterial drugs, the effects on foetuses were recorded at levels of 
exposure well below that observed in humans. As delafloxacin is excreted in milk, severe toxicity was 
observed in newborn rats during lactation when mothers were treated during pregnancy and lactation 
with delafloxacin at a dose producing a systemic exposure about 5-fold higher than observed in 
humans. However, no such effects and no other developmental abnormalities occurred in the progeny 
of mothers exposed up to a level about 2-fold higher than observed in humans. No effects were 
detected on rat male and female fertility at a level of exposure about 5-fold higher than that observed 
in humans. 
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with delafloxacin. 
No genotoxicity hazard was identified in vitro and it was negative in vivo at the highest possible dose 
≥ 15 times the estimated human plasma exposure based on AUC. 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that delafloxacin may pose a risk to aquatic 
compartment(s).

4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Quofenix is indicated for the treatment of  the following infections in adults: 
•  acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) 
•  community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended 
for the initial treatment of these infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended regimen of delafloxacin is 450 mg oral every 12 hours for a total duration of 5 to 
14 days for ABSSSI and 5 to 10 days for CAP at the discretion of the physician. Delafloxacin tablets 
can be taken with or without food.  
Special population 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required. As per fluoroquinolone class patients aged over 60 years are at 
increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Renal Impairment 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 4.4 and 
5.2). Quofenix is not recommended in patients with ESRD. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Quofenix is contraindicated in children and adolescents (see section 4.3). 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Tablets should be swallowed and can be taken with or without food. 
The patient should drink a sufficient amount of fluids while taking Quofenix. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to any fluoroquinolone or quinolone antibacterial medicinal product. 
Previous history of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone administration. 
Pregnancy, women of childbearing potential not using contraception and breast-feeding (see section 
4.6). 
Children or growing adolescents below 18 years of age (see section 4.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The use of delafloxacin should be avoided in patients who have experienced serious adverse reactions 
in the past when using quinolone or fluoroquinolone containing products (see section 4.8). Treatment 
of these patients with delafloxacin should only be initiated in the absence of alternative treatment 
options and after careful benefit/risk assessment (see also section 4.3). 
Contraception 
If women of a sexually mature age are treated, effective contraception must be used during treatment 
(see section 4.6). 
Aortic dissection and aneurysm, and heart valve regurgitation/incompetence 
Epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection, particularly in 
elderly patients, and of aortic and mitral valve regurgitation after intake of fluoroquinolones. 
Cases of aortic aneurysm and dissection, sometimes complicated by rupture (including fatal ones), and 
of regurgitation/incompetence of any of the heart valves have been reported in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolones (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, fluoroquinolones should only be used after careful benefit-risk assessment and after 
consideration of other therapeutic options in patients with positive family history of aneurysm disease 
or congenital heart valve disease, or in patients diagnosed with pre-existing aortic aneurysm and/or 
aortic dissection or heart valve disease, or in presence of other risk factors or conditions predisposing  
- 
- 
- 
for both aortic aneurysm and dissection and heart valve regurgitation/incompetence (e.g. 
connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner 
syndrome, Behcet’s disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis) or additionally 
for aortic aneurysm and dissection (e.g. vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis or giant 
cell arteritis, or known atherosclerosis, or Sjögren’s syndrome) or additionally 
for heart valve regurgitation/incompetence (e.g. infective endocarditis). 
The risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection, and their rupture may also be increased in patients treated 
concurrently with systemic corticosteroids. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of sudden abdominal, chest or back pain, patients should be advised to immediately consult a 
physician in an emergency department. 
Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention in case of acute dyspnoea, new onset 
of heart palpitations, or development of oedema of the abdomen or lower extremities. 
Tendinitis and tendon rupture 
Tendinitis and tendon rupture (especially but not limited to Achilles tendon), sometimes bilateral, may 
occur as early as within 48 hours of starting treatment with quinolones and fluoroquinolones and have 
been reported to occur even up to several months after discontinuation of treatment. The risk of 
tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in older patients, patients with renal impairment, patients 
with solid organ transplants, and those treated concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, 
concomitant use of corticosteroids should be avoided. At the first sign of tendinitis (e.g. painful 
swelling, inflammation) the treatment with delafloxacin should be discontinued and alternative 
treatment should be considered. The affected limb(s) should be appropriately treated (e.g. 
immobilisation). Corticosteroids should not be used if signs of tendinopathy occur (see section 4.8). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Cases of sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy resulting in paraesthesia, hypaesthesia, dysesthesia, 
or weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and fluoroquinolones. Patients under 
treatment with delafloxacin should be advised to inform their doctor prior to continuing treatment if 
symptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop in order to 
prevent the development of potentially irreversible condition (see section 4.8). 
Central Nervous System Effects 
Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) 
reactions, including: convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) 
and toxic psychosis. Fluoroquinolones may also cause CNS reactions of nervousness, agitation, 
insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, paranoia, dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and 
suicidal thoughts or acts. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions 
occur in patients receiving delafloxacin, delafloxacin should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate measures should be instituted. Delafloxacin should be used when the benefits of treatment 
exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., severe cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or 
lower the seizure threshold. 
Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis 
Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in 
persons with myasthenia gravis. Post-marketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and 
requirement for ventilator support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with 
myasthenia gravis. The use of delafloxacin is not recommended in patients with known history of 
myasthenia gravis. 
Clostridioides difficile-associated disease 
Clostridioides difficile-associated disease has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial 
medicinal products, with severity ranging from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. Clostridioides difficile-
associated disease must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhoea. If Clostridioides 
difficile-associated disease is suspected or confirmed treatment with delafloxacin should be 
discontinued and appropriate supportive measures together with the specific antibacterial treatment of 
C. difficile should be considered. 
Medicinal products inhibiting the peristalsis are contraindicated if Clostridioides difficile-associated 
disease is suspected. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients with known hypersensitivity to delafloxacin or other fluoroquinolones should not take 
Quofenix (see section 4.3). Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions 
have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicinal products. Before 
initiating therapy with Quofenix, careful inquiry should be made about previous hypersensitivity 
reactions to other quinolone or fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicinal products. If an anaphylactic 
reaction to Quofenix occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate therapy should be instituted. 
Patients with renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of the dose recommendation in patients with severe renal impairment has not 
been clinically evaluated and is based on pharmacokinetic modelling data. Delafloxacin should only 
be used in such patients when it is considered that the expected clinical benefit outweighs the potential 
risk. Clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients. 
Administration of oral delafloxacin in patients with severe renal impairment and low body weight may 
lead to increased systemic exposures. Quofenix is not recommended in patients with ESRD. 
Limitations of the clinical data 
In the two major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis/erysipelas, 
abscesses and wound infections only. Other types of skin infections have not been studied. Patients 
with toxic shock, neutropenia (neutrophil counts <500 cells/mm3) or severely immunocompromised 
patients were not included in the studies. There is limited experience in patients aged > 75 years. 
However, the CAP population was older than the one studied in ABSSSI (48.3 % of subjects were ≥ 
65 years and 23.9% ≥ 75 years). In the CAP study 90.7% of patients had CURB-65 score of  ≤2. 
However 69.3% of patients were categorised to PORT class III and 30.7% of patients had a PORT 
score >III.              
Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse drug reactions 
Very rare cases of prolonged (continuing months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible 
serious adverse drug reactions affecting different, sometimes multiple, body systems (musculoskeletal, 
nervous, psychiatric and senses) have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and 
fluoroquinolones irrespective of their age and pre-existing risk factors. Delafloxacin should be 
discontinued immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction and patients 
should be advised to contact their prescriber for advice. 
Superinfection 
Fluoroquinolone non-susceptible microorganisms may result in superinfection with the use of 
delafloxacin. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 
Dysglycaemia 
As with all quinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia have been reported (see section 4.8), usually in diabetic patients receiving 
concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic agent (e.g., glibenclamide) or with insulin. Cases 
of hypoglycaemic coma have been reported. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose 
is recommended. 
There are no data available on severe cases of hypoglycaemia resulting in coma or death after 
delafloxacin use. 
Serious bullous skin reactions 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases of bullous skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have 
been reported with other fluoroquinolones. Patients should be advised to contact their doctor 
immediately prior to continuing treatment if skin and/or mucosal reactions occur. 
Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 
Patients with a family history of, or actual glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are prone to 
haemolytic reactions when treated with other quinolones. Therefore, delafloxacin should be used with 
caution in these patients. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 39 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 2% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on delafloxacin 
Chelation active substance: antacids, sucralfate, metal cations, multivitamins 
Fluoroquinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Oral administration of 
delafloxacin with antacids containing aluminium or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations 
such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent 
and trivalent cations such as didanosine buffered tablets for oral suspension or the paediatric powder 
for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of delafloxacin, resulting in systemic 
concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, delafloxacin should be taken at least 
2 hours before or 6 hours after these agents. 
Effect of delafloxacin on other medicinal products 
Based on in vitro data on metabolising enzymes and transporters delafloxacin possesses a low 
potential to alter the disposition of other medicinal products (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
delafloxacin. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of delafloxacin in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). In the absence of human data and findings 
in non-clinical studies at human therapeutic exposures, delafloxacin is contraindicated during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether delafloxacin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of 
delafloxacin/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment with delafloxacin. 
Fertility 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effects of delafloxacin on fertility in humans have not been studied. Nonclinical studies conducted 
with delafloxacin in rats do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility or reproductive 
performance (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Quofenix has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some adverse drug 
reactions (e.g. dizziness, headache, visual disorders) may impair the patient's ability to concentrate and 
react, and therefore may constitute a risk in situations where the patient operates an automobile or 
machinery or engages in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions reported in ABSSSI (Phase 2 and 3 studies) and CAP 
(Phase 3 study)  involving a total of 1,297 patients (868 subjects in acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infections and 429 subjects in community-acquired pneumonia), exposed to delafloxacin, 
intravenous or oral formulation, were diarrhoea, nausea and  hypertransaminasaemia (5.86%, 5.47% 
and 2.85% respectively) which were mild to moderate in intensity. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified in four comparative ABSSSI Phase 2 and 3 
studies and in one CAP Phase 3 study classified by preferred term and System Organ Class, and by 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).

 *Very rare cases of prolonged (up to months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible serious 
drug reactions affecting several, sometimes multiple, system organ classes and senses (including 
reactions such as tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, 
neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, fatigue, memory impairment, sleep disorders, 
and impairment of hearing, vision, taste and smell) have been reported in association with the use of 
quinolones and fluoroquinolones in some cases irrespective of pre-existing risk factors (see section 
4.4). 
** Cases of aortic aneurysm and dissection, sometimes complicated by rupture (including fatal ones), 
and of regurgitation/incompetence of any of the heart valves have been reported in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolones (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest daily oral dose administered in clinical studies was 1600 mg; the patients who receive this 
dose did not have any adverse drug reactions or notable clinical laboratory test findings during the 
study. Treatment of overdose with delafloxacin should consist of observation and general supportive 
measures. 
5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, fluoroquinolones, ATC code: J01MA23 
Mechanism of action 
Delafloxacin inhibits bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), enzymes 
required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. 
Resistance 
Resistance to fluoroquinolones, including delafloxacin, can occur due to mutations in defined regions 
of the target bacterial enzymes topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase referred to as Quinolone-Resistance 
Determining Regions (QRDRs), or through other resistance mechanisms such as efflux mechanisms. 
Cross-resistance between delafloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may be observed, although some 
isolates resistant to other fluoroquinolone may retain susceptibility to delafloxacin. 
Susceptibility testing breakpoints 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for delafloxacin are as follows: 
Organism  
Staphylococcus aureus (ABSSSI) 
Staphylococcus aureus (CAP)

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Quofenix in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of local infections of skin and 
subcutaneous tissues and community-acquired pneumonia (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following oral administration of 450 mg of delafloxacin every 12 hours, steady state concentrations 
are achieved after approximately 5 days with about 36% accumulation after multiple administrations. 
The half-life of oral delafloxacin is approximately 14 hours. Delafloxacin pharmacokinetic is 
comparable in patients with ABSSSI or CAP and healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
Peak plasma delafloxacin concentrations are achieved within about 1 hour after oral administration 
under fasting conditions. The 450-mg tablet and 300-mg IV formulations are bioequivalent with 
regard to total exposure (AUC). Delafloxacin may be administered with or without food as total 
systemic exposure (AUC∞) is unchanged between fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie) conditions. 
Distribution 
The steady state volume of distribution of delafloxacin is about 40 L which approximates total body 
water. The plasma protein binding of delafloxacin, is approximately 84%; it primarily binds to 
albumin. Plasma protein binding of delafloxacin is not significantly affected by the degree of renal 
impairment. 
Following IV administration of 7 doses of 300 mg of delafloxacin to 30 healthy volunteers, the mean 
delafloxacin AUC0-12 (3.6 hr*µg/mL) in alveolar macrophages was 83% of the free-plasma AUC0-12, 
and the mean delafloxacin AUC0-12 (2.8 hr*µg/mL) in epithelial lining fluid was 65% of the free-
plasma AUC0-12. 
Biotransformation 
Glucuronidation of delafloxacin is the primary metabolic pathway with oxidative metabolism 
representing <1% of an administered dose. The glucuronidation of delafloxacin is mediated mainly by 
UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT2B15. Unchanged parent drug is the predominant component in plasma. 
There are no significant circulating metabolites (mean=9.6%) in humans. 
In vitro data indicate that delafloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations does not inhibit cytochrome 
P450 CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and 
CYP3A4/5 nor UDP glucuronosyl transferases isoforms UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Delafloxacin does 
not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5. 
Likewise at clinically relevant concentrations delafloxacin does not inhibit the transporters MDR1, 
BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K and BSEP. 
Delafloxacin is a probable substrate of BCRP. 
Elimination 
Following a single oral dose of 14C-labeled delafloxacin, 50% of the radioactivity is excreted in the 
urine as unchanged delafloxacin and glucuronide metabolites and 48% is excreted unchanged in the 
faeces. 
Obese patients (≥30 kg/m2 BMI) 
Pharmacokinetic parameters are not altered in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). 
Hepatic impairment 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically meaningful changes in delafloxacin pharmacokinetics when administered delafloxacin in 
patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) compared 
to matched healthy control subjects. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary. 
Renal impairment 
Following a single oral (400 mg) administration to patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment, mean total exposure (AUCt) was about 1.5-fold higher for subjects with moderate and 
severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects, whereas total systemic exposures were 
comparable to subjects with mild renal impairment. Peak exposure (Cmax) was not statistically 
significantly different between renal impaired and healthy subjects. 
For dosing instructions in subjects with renal impairment refer to section 4.2. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of delafloxacin is not significantly altered with age; therefore, dose adjustment 
is not necessary based on age. 
Paediatric population 
No clinical trials have been conducted with delafloxacin in paediatric patients. 
Gender 
Clinically significant gender-related differences in delafloxacin pharmacokinetics have not been 
observed in healthy subjects or in patients with ABSSSI or CAP. No dose adjustment is recommended 
based on gender. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, gastrointestinal effects were the main findings: these 
included dilated cecum (oral only), abnormal stool, and decreased food intake and / or body weight in 
rats, and emesis, salivation and abnormal stool / diarrhoea in dogs. In addition increases in serum ALT 
and ALP, and reduced total protein and globulin values were recorded at the end of the treatment 
period in the pivotal 4-week IV dog study at the high dose (75 mg/kg) in individual dogs. Importantly, 
gastrointestinal effects and slightly elevated liver enzymes in dogs were not associated with 
histopathological changes of gastrointestinal and annexed tissues (pancreas, liver). No adverse effects 
were seen in rats at exposures about 2-fold higher than humans, or in dogs at exposures approximately 
equal to humans. 
In embryo-fetal development studies carried out in rats and rabbits, delafloxacin was devoid of 
teratogenic effects but induced foetal growth retardation and ossification delays at levels of dose 
producing maternal toxicity. In rats foetal effects occurred at a level of exposure exceeding about 2-
fold that observed in humans based on the AUC, but in rabbits, a species known to be extremely 
sensitive to maternal toxicity of antibacterial drugs, the effects on foetuses were recorded at levels of 
exposure well below that observed in humans. As delafloxacin is excreted in milk, severe toxicity was 
observed in newborn rats during lactation when mothers were treated during pregnancy and lactation 
with delafloxacin at a dose producing a systemic exposure about 5-fold higher than observed in 
humans. However, no such effects and no other developmental abnormalities occurred in the progeny 
of mothers exposed up to a level about 2-fold higher than observed in humans. No effects were 
detected on rat male and female fertility at a level of exposure about 5-fold higher than that observed 
in humans. 
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with delafloxacin. 
No genotoxicity hazard was identified in vitro and it was negative in vivo at the highest possible dose 
≥ 15 times the estimated human plasma exposure based on AUC. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that delafloxacin may pose a risk to aquatic 
compartment(s).

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Quofenix is and what it is used for 
Quofenix is an antibiotic that contains the active substance delafloxacin. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called fluoroquinolones. 
It is used to treat adults with serious short-term infections caused by certain bacteria when usual 
antibiotics cannot be used or have not worked: 
• 
• 
infections of the skin and tissue under the skin 
infection of the lungs called ‘pneumonia’. 
It works by blocking bacteria enzymes needed to copy and to repair their DNA. By blocking these 
enzymes, Quofenix kills bacteria that cause the infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Quofenix 
You must not be given Quofenix: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are allergic to delafloxacin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are allergic to any other fluoroquinolone or quinolone antibacterial medicine. 
If you have ever had a problem with your tendons such as tendonitis that was related to 
treatment with a ‘quinolone antibiotic’. A tendon is the cord that joins your muscle to your 
skeleton. 
If you are pregnant, might become pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. 
If you are breast-feeding. 
If you are a child or growing adolescent below 18 years of age. 
Warnings and precautions 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before you are given this medicine 
You should not be given fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quofenix, if 
you have experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or 
fluoroquinolone. In this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. 
When you are given this medicine 
• 
Pain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. Your 
risk is increased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, 
have kidney problems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. Inflammation and 
ruptures of tendons may occur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several 
months after stopping Quofenix therapy. At the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon 
(for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder or knee), stop taking Quofenix, contact 
your doctor and rest the painful area. Avoid any unnecessary exercise as this might increase 
the risk of a tendon rupture. 
•  You may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, 
tingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. If this 
happens, stop taking Quofenix and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the 
development of potentially irreversible condition. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before you are given Quofenix if: 
•  You have been diagnosed with an enlargement or “bulge” of a large blood vessel (aortic 
aneurysm or large vessel peripheral aneurysm). 
•  You have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall). 
•  You have been diagnosed with leaking heart valves (heart valve regurgitation). 
•  You have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or congenital heart valve 
disease, or other risk factors or predisposing conditions (e. g. connective tissue disorders such 
as Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Sjögren’s syndrome [an 
inflammatory autoimmune disease], or vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis, giant 
cell arteritis, Behcet’s disease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis [a disease of the joints] or endocarditis [an infection of the heart] ). 
•  You have had tendon problems during previous treatment with a fluoroquinolone or 
quinolone antibiotic. 
•  You have or may have problems with the central nervous system (e.g. severe cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or have other risk factors that may put you at more risk of having 
seizures (fits). In those cases your doctor will consider if this treatment is the best option for 
you. 
•  You have a myasthenia gravis (a type of muscle weakness), because symptoms can become 
worse. 
•  You are suffering from diarrhoea, or have previously suffered from diarrhoea while taking 
antibiotics or up to 2 months afterwards. Contact your doctor straight away if you have 
diarrhoea during or after your treatment. Do not take any medicine to treat your diarrhoea 
without first checking with your doctor. 
•  You have kidney problems. 
•  You had sometimes long treatment with antibiotics; it can mean that you get another infection 
caused by other bacteria (superinfection) which cannot be treated by the antibiotic. Talk to 
your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about this and using Quofenix. 
•  You may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or lesion. 
•  You or a member of your family is known to have a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase. 
•  You have diabetes. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including Quofenix, may cause levels of 
glucose in the blood to rise too high or fall too low. If you have diabetes, you should monitor 
your blood glucose levels carefully. 
42 
 
 
 
 
If you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, which can be symptoms of aortic 
aneurysm and dissection, go immediately to an emergency room. Your risk may be increased if you 
are being treated with systemic corticosteroids. 
If you start experiencing a rapid onset of shortness of breath, especially when you lie down flat in your 
bed, or you notice swelling of your ankles, feet or abdomen, or a new onset of heart palpitations 
(sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), you should inform a doctor immediately. 
Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects 
Fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines have been associated with very rare but serious 
side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or years), disabling or potentially 
irreversible. This includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the upper and lower limbs, difficulty in 
walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, tingling, tickling, numbness or burning 
(paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment of vision, taste and smell, and hearing, 
depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue, and severe sleep disorders. 
If you experience any of these side effects after receiving Quofenix, contact your doctor immediately 
prior to continuing treatment. You and your doctor will decide on continuing the treatment considering 
also an antibiotic from another class. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine must not be used in children and adolescents, as it has not been studied enough in these 
groups. 
Other medicines and Quofenix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
There are no data concerning an interaction of intravenous delafloxacin with multivitamins, other 
supplements or didanosine. However, Quofenix should not be given together with any solution 
containing substances such as calcium and magnesium, through the same intravenous line. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Quofenix must not be used if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Quofenix must not be used in women 
of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell 
your doctor before you are given this medicine. 
If you might become pregnant you have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
Quofenix. 
Driving and using machines 
Quofenix can make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other 
activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how Quofenix affects you.  
Quofenix contains cyclodextrin 
This medicine contains 2480 mg of sulfobutylbetadex sodiumin each vial. 
Quofenix contains sodium 
This medicine contains 175 mg of sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 8.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Quofenix 
Quofenix will be given to you by a nurse or doctor via an infusion (drip) into a vein. 
You will be given one infusion of Quofenix, containing 300 mg of the medicine, twice a day between 
5 and 14 days for skin infections and between 5 and 10 days for pneumonia, at the discretion of your 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doctor. Each infusion will last about an hour. Your doctor will decide how many days treatment is 
needed. 
Tell your doctor if you suffer from kidney problems because your dose may need to be adjusted. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
If you are given more Quofenix than you should 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are concerned that you may have been given too much 
Quofenix. 
If you miss a dose of Quofenix 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are concerned that you may have missed a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Please, inform your doctor or nurse immediately if you get any of these symptoms, as the medicine 
should be stopped and you may need urgent medical attention: 
- Difficulty in swallowing or difficulty in breathing and cough; swelling of your lips, face, throat or 
tongue; dry throat or throat tightening and severe rash. These may be signs and symptoms of a 
hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction and may be life-threatening. These severe reactions are uncommon 
side effects that may affect up to 1 in 100 people. 
- Drop in blood pressure; blurred vision; dizziness. This severe reaction is an uncommon side effect 
that may affect up to 1 in 100 people. 
- Abdominal (belly) pain with possible severe diarrhoea; fever and nausea. These may be signs of an 
infection of the bowel, which shouldn’t be treated with diarrhoea medicines that stop your bowels 
from moving. Infection of the bowel (Clostridioides difficile infection) is an uncommon side effect 
that may affect up to 1 in 100 people. 
Other side effects may include:

1.  What Quofenix is and what it is used for 
Quofenix is an antibiotic that contains the active substance delafloxacin. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called fluoroquinolones. 
It is used to treat adults with serious short-term infections caused by certain bacteria when usual 
antibiotics cannot be used or have not worked: 
• 
• 
infections of the skin and tissue under the skin 
infection of the lungs called ‘pneumonia’. 
It works by blocking bacteria enzymes needed to copy and to repair their DNA. By blocking these 
enzymes Quofenix kills bacteria that cause the infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Quofenix 
Do not take Quofenix: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are allergic to delafloxacin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are allergic to any other fluoroquinolone or quinolone antibacterial medicine. 
If you have ever had a problem with your tendons such as tendonitis that was related to 
treatment with a ‘quinolone antibiotic’. A tendon is the cord that joins your muscle to your 
skeleton. 
If you are pregnant, might become pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. 
If you are breast-feeding. 
If you are a child or growing adolescent below 18 years of age. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before taking this medicine 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should not take fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quofenix, if you 
have experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or fluoroquinolone. 
In this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. 
When taking this medicine 
• 
Pain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. Your 
risk is increased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, 
have kidney problems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. Inflammation and 
ruptures of tendons may occur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several 
months after stopping Quofenix therapy. At the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon 
(for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder or knee), stop taking Quofenix, contact 
your doctor and rest the painful area. Avoid any unnecessary exercise as this might increase 
the risk of a tendon rupture. 
•  You may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, 
tingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. If this 
happens, stop taking Quofenix and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the 
development of potentially irreversible condition. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Quofenix if: 
•  You have been diagnosed with an enlargement or “bulge” of a large blood vessel (aortic 
aneurysm or large vessel peripheral aneurysm). 
•  You have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall). 
•  You have been diagnosed with leaking heart valves (heart valve regurgitation). 
•  You have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or congenital heart valve 
disease, or other risk factors or predisposing conditions (e. g. connective tissue disorders such 
as Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Sjögren’s syndrome [an 
inflammatory autoimmune disease], or vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis, giant 
cell arteritis, Behcet’s disease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis [a disease of the joints] or endocarditis [an infection of the heart] ). 
•  You have had tendon problems during previous treatment with a fluoroquinolone or 
quinolone antibiotic. 
•  You have or may have problems with the central nervous system (e.g. severe cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or have other risk factors that may put you at more risk of having 
seizures (fits). In those cases yor doctor will consider if this treatment is the best option for 
you. 
•  You have a myasthenia gravis (a type of muscle weakness), because symptoms can become 
worse. 
•  You are suffering from diarrhoea, or have previously suffered from diarrhoea while taking 
antibiotics or up to 2 months afterwards. Contact your doctor straight away if you have 
diarrhoea during or after your treatment. Do not take any medicine to treat your diarrhoea 
without first checking with your doctor. 
•  You have kidney problems. 
•  You had sometimes long treatment with antibiotics; it can mean that you get another infection 
caused by other bacteria (superinfection) which cannot be treated by the antibiotic. Talk to 
your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about this and using Quofenix. 
•  You may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or lesion. 
•  You or a member of your family is known to have a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase. 
•  You have diabetes. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including Quofenix, may cause levels of 
glucose in the blood to rise too high or fall too low. If you have diabetes, you should monitor 
your blood glucose levels carefully. 
If you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, which can be symptoms of aortic 
aneurysm and dissection, go immediately to an emergency room. Your risk may be increased if you 
are being treated with systemic corticosteroids. 
51 
 
 
 
 
If you start experiencing a rapid onset of shortness of breath, especially when you lie down flat in your 
bed, or you notice swelling of your ankles, feet or abdomen, or a new onset of heart palpitations 
(sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), you should inform a doctor immediately. 
Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects 
Fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines have been associated with very rare but serious 
side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or years), disabling or potentially 
irreversible. This includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the upper and lower limbs, difficulty in 
walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, tingling, tickling, numbness or burning 
(paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment of vision, taste and smell, and hearing, 
depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue and severe sleep disorders. 
If you experience any of these side effects after taking Quofenix, contact your doctor immediately 
prior to continuing treatment. You and your doctor will decide on continuing the treatment considering 
also an antibiotic from another class.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges globally. Its impact is considerable in 
the Western world and it is now also an emerging epidemic in developing countries. Overweight and 
obesity are commonly classified using the body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of height in metres. More than one-third of adults in the US and in countries 
across Europe are classified as obese, defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2or greater, and 30-70% are 
overweight, with a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2.  
Obesity has many serious health consequences, and a decreased life expectancy of 5–10 years, which 
make reducing its high prevalence a public health priority. It is a chronic condition associated with 
major  comorbidities  that  include  hypertension,  hyperglycaemia,  dyslipidaemia,  certain  types  of 
cancer,  obstructive  sleep  apnoea  (OSA)  and  atherosclerosis.  Obesity  and  overweight  are  also 
independent risk factors for myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, the leading cause of 
death  worldwide.  The  relationship  between  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  is  well 
established, and the global obesity epidemic largely explains the 3-fold increase in the rates of T2DM 
in recent years. Obesity-related pre-diabetes increases the risk of developing T2DM 5-to 6-fold. It is 
also estimated that up to 5% of adults in Western countries may have undiagnosed OSA, and up to 
20% may have at least mild OSA. Obesity adversely affects physical and mental health and reduces 
quality  of  life.  Obese  individuals  often  suffer  from  physical  symptoms,  such  as  joint  pain,  and 
psychosocial problems.  
Increased caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle have contributed to the increased prevalence of 
obesity in recent decades. Although not all people with obesity develop health problems, the risk of 
obesity-related complications and comorbidities increases with increasing BMI, and even a moderate 
weight  loss  of  5–10%  has  been  shown  to  have  significant  health  benefits  in  terms  of  improving 
glycaemic control, reducing progression to T2DM and improving other weight-related comorbidities, 
as mentioned above, as well as physical symptoms and quality of life. Current American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) treatment guidelines also recommend that individuals with T2DM achieve modest 
weight loss (5–7%) to improve glycaemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk.  
Lifestyle intervention in the form of dietary, behavioural and exercise counselling is traditionally the 
primary treatment for obesity. However, the causes of obesity are multifactorial and associated with 
numerous complex environmental, physiological and genetic factors, making treatment challenging. 
Scientific  evidence  suggests  that  weight  gain  and  obesity  lead  to  hormonal,  metabolic  and 
neurochemical adaptations that may affect the regulation of energy balance, promoting maintenance 
of  the  increased  weight  and  making  weight  loss  difficult.  Moreover,  during  weight  loss  the  body 
appears  to  compensate  by  reducing  metabolism  and  increasing  the  production  of  hormones  that 
stimulate appetite. These combined effects tend to favour weight regain, and explain why sustained 
weight  loss  is  difficult  to  achieve  and  why  many  people  struggle  to  maintain  their  weight  loss  by 
lifestyle intervention alone.  
Surgical treatments offer an effective alternative for some people with severe obesity; however, these 
are  unavailable  or  unsuitable  for  many  obese  individuals  and  are  often  associated  with  risks  and 
complications related to the problems inherent in operating on obese individuals. Major and minor 
complications  occurred  in  3.3%  and  27%  of  patients,  respectively,  in  one  study.  Few  effective 
treatment  options  are  therefore  available  for  obese  individuals,  especially  those  who  suffer  from 
Assessment report

obesity-related  health  problems.  Pharmacotherapy  may  serve  as  a  valuable  adjunct  to  lifestyle 
intervention in achieving and sustaining clinically relevant weight loss; it may also have the potential 
to moderate the metabolic responses that favour weight regain. However, there is a limited range of 
weight management medications currently available.  
Orlistat is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that has been on the market since 1998. Whilst it has 
shown moderate beneficial effects on weight loss and blood pressure, orlistat is associated with an 
array of side effects that limit its tolerability, including steatorrhoea, faecal incontinence and rectal 
discharge. Since then, new products for the treatment of obesity have been authorised in the EU and 
US,  but  also  several  approved  obesity  medications  have  been  withdrawn  or  their  marketing 
authorisation has been suspended due to safety issues. Liraglutide is in a different pharmacological 
class to the other weight management products currently or previously approved, with a different 
mechanism of action.  
About the product 
Saxenda is proposed as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adult patients (≥ 18 years) with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of 
• 
• 
≥ 30 kg/m² (obese), or  
≥  27  kg/m²  to  <  30  kg/m²  (overweight)  in  the  presence  of  at  least  one  weight  related 
comorbidity  such  as  dysglycaemia  (pre-diabetes  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus),  hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, or obstructive sleep apnoea. 
Liraglutide is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue classified as a ‘GLP-1 receptor 
agonist’, with 97% homology to human GLP-1. Liraglutide has unique therapeutic potential for the 
treatment  of  obesity,  due  to  its  combined  effects  not  only  on  body  weight  but  also  on  glycaemic 
control and other weight-related comorbidities, as described below. The well-characterized effects of 
liraglutide  in  the  body  are  mediated  via  specific  activation  of  the  GLP-1  receptor.  During  eating, 
multiple hormonal and neuronal signals are released in the body and these signals are processed by 
the  brain  and  translated  into  feelings  of  hunger  or  satiety,  in  order  to  control  food  intake.  Gut 
hormones,  including  GLP-1,  are  modulated  by  acute  food  ingestion.  In  animal  studies,  peripheral 
administration  of  liraglutide  leads  to  decreased  food  intake  and  weight  loss.  Animal  studies  have 
demonstrated that liraglutide can access brain regions that are critical to the regulation of energy 
intake, thus indicating the potential of liraglutide to activate the GLP-1 receptor in the brain. 
In humans, weight loss with liraglutide is primarily mediated by its effects on appetite. Body weight is 
regulated  by  complex  homeostatic  mechanisms,  and  obesity  is  a  result  of  caloric/energy  intake 
chronically  exceeding  expenditure.  Liraglutide  treatment  affects  the  four  main  components  of 
appetite regulation (fullness, satiety, hunger and prospective food consumption [how much a person 
thinks  he/she  can  eat]),  leading  to  reduced  caloric  intake,  which  is  not  due  to  reduced  meal 
palatability. Liraglutide-induced weight loss is primarily due to reduction in fat mass rather than lean 
body  mass.  Liraglutide  is  associated  with  a  small  decrease  in  energy  expenditure.  Furthermore, 
liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion, lowers inappropriately high glucagon secretion, and improves 
beta-cell  function  in  a  glucose-dependent  manner,  which  results  in  a  lowering  of  fasting  and 
post-prandial  glucose.  The  mechanism  of  blood  glucose  lowering  also  involves  a  delay  in  gastric 
emptying, which may contribute to the observed reductions in postprandial glucose. 
Liraglutide  demonstrates  benefits  for  glycaemic  control  at  doses  up  to  1.8 mg/day  and  has  been

0.9 mg), Australia and China for the treatment of adults with T2DM. The cumulative post-marketing 
Assessment report

exposure is estimated to be 1,500,000 to 2,200,000 patient years, assuming an average daily dose of 
1.8 mg or 1.2 mg, respectively, based on the released volume of Victoza in units between 30 June 
2009 and 02 July 2013 (the cut-off date for this application). 
The moderate dose-dependent weight loss observed in clinical trials with liraglutide in T2DM, together 
with the reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and improvements in beta-cell function 
and cardiometabolic risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, led to investigations into its potential 
therapeutic use in weight management. The intended liraglutide dose for use in weight management 
is 3 mg, administered as a once-daily subcutaneous injection. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Liraglutide under the invented name Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026) is currently approved in the EU for 
the  treatment  of  diabetes  mellitus  at  doses  up  to  1.8  mg/day.  The  active  substance  and  the 
composition of the bulk finished product (filled cartridges) of Saxenda and Victoza are identical. As the 
final  finished  product  differs  from  Victoza  with  respect  to  a  different  pen  injector  device,  specific 
information related to the new device has been provided, including device safety, assembly/ controls, 
dose  accuracy  specifications,  validation  and  usability,  notified  body  certificate  and  stability. 
Furthermore, the maximum daily dose for Saxenda is 3.0 mg/ day therefore data from clinical batches 
used in weight management studies have been provided. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Liraglutide is a long acting analogue of the naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1(7-37)). Liraglutide has a substitution of the naturally occurring amino acid residue in position 
34 (Lys) by Arg and addition of a Glu-spaced hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) to the ε-amino group 
of Lys in position 26. See Figure below. The analogue is produced using the recombinant DNA 
technology in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and is further chemically modified by addition of the 
Glu-spaced hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid in order to prolong its biological activity.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The liraglutide active substance manufacturing process includes fermentation of yeast cells, recovery 
and  purification  of  liraglutide  precursor,  acylation  of  the  precursor  and  further  purification  of 
liraglutide  to  active  substance.  The  production  process  includes  pooling  of  fermentation  batches, 
recovery batches and pooling at several purification steps. A suitable control system is in place. The 
scale  and  the  yield  of  the  different  fermentation,  recovery  and  purification  stages  are  described. 
Manufacturing  process  development,  filling,  storage  and  transportation  (shipping)  procedures  are 
adequately described. Furthermore, the manufacturing process development satisfactorily details the 
development of the liraglutide manufacturing process. 
Control of materials 
The  generation  of  the  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  strain  producing  liraglutide  precursor,  the  cell 
banking  system  and  stability  of  the  cell  banks  has  been  adequately  described  in  the  ‘control  of 
materials’ section. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
To control the manufacturing process, critical process parameters and critical in-process controls for 
fermentation,  recovery  and  purification  steps  are  laid  down  in  the  dossier.  Operational  limits  and 
acceptance criteria for critical process parameters and in-process controls are specified. The strategy 
to handle changes to non-critical process parameters and non-critical IPCs is based on the change 
control  system  in  place.  This  strategy  is  deemed  adequate  to  assure  that  the  process  is  run  in  a 
validated state. 
Process validation 
Three consecutive active substance batches were used to validate the fermentation, recovery and 
purification  process.  Data  was  collected  for  critical  in-process  controls,  specification  tests  on 
liraglutide  active  substance  and  additional  analyses.  Results  demonstrated  that  the  liraglutide 
manufacturing process is robust, yielding a product of acceptable and reproducible quality. Removal 
of process related impurities including host cell proteins and DNA and other impurities is adequately 
described. 
Characterisation studies 
Extensive structural characterisation studies have been performed on the active substance and the 
physico-chemical properties have been demonstrated. The product related impurities are studied in 
sufficient  depth.  The  bioactivity  of  the  main  fractions  have  been  characterised  by  a  cell-based 
bioactivity  assay.  This  measures  adenylate  cyclase  activation,  by  liraglutide,  of  the  cloned  human 
GLP-1 receptor, resulting in cAMP accumulation in a dose dependent manner. The bioassay reflects 
the  expected  physiological  mechanism  in  the  clinical  situation.  Product  related  impurities  are 
impurities structurally related to liraglutide. They are generated during fermentation or downstream 
processing  or  storage.  Related  impurities  associated  with  liraglutide  and  potential  degradation 
products  have  been  identified  by  collection  and  structural  characterisation  and/or  by  spiking  with 
purified  and  structurally  characterised  impurities.  The  product  related  impurities  are  routinely 
controlled by in-process controls as well as the active substance specification.

The analytical assays and their validation are acceptable.  
An overview of the analytical results for relevant liraglutide drug substance batches is presented. The 
batches have been used for non-clinical studies, clinical studies, stability studies, reference material, 
process validation and setting of specifications.  
Stability 
Results of long-term , accelerated and stress  stability studies have been provided. The stability data 
provided supports the proposed shelf lives of intermediates and drug substance. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
During development of liraglutide active substance, changes in the active substance manufacturing 
process have been introduced, which are related to different production campaigns. Comparability 
(batch release, stability and characterisation) has been demonstrated for all campaigns. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The product is a solution for subcutaneous injection containing 6.0 mg/ml of the active substance.  
The product is packaged in a type I clear glass 3 ml cartridge with Ph.Eur. compliant closures.  
The  cartridge  is  assembled  in  a  pen-injector.  The  dose  scale  of  the  pen-injector  reflect  the 
recommended dosages in the SmPC: doses of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4 mg (dose escalation) and 3 mg 
(maintenance  dose)  can  be  delivered.  The  dose  accuracy  of  the  pen-injector  system  has  been 
demonstrated.  
The  list  of  excipients  includes  disodium  phosphate  dihydrate,  phenol,  propylene  glycol,  sodium 
hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, and water for injections. These are all known excipients complying with 
at least Ph. Eur.  
The development of the product has been described, the choice of excipients is justified and their 
functions explained. Extensive development studies have been submitted. The formulation, which is 
already marketed as Victoza indicated for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, is identical to the 
clinical batches provided in support of the Saxenda application.  
The  optimal  phenol  concentration  was  chosen  following  investigations  of  the  required  amounts 
needed to comply with Ph. Eur. Antimicrobial effectiveness has been adequately demonstrated. 
As  concerns  the  primary  packaging  i.e.  a  3  ml  cartridge,  the  compatibility  with  the  drug,  the 
assessment of extractables and of leachables have been considered acceptably demonstrated. The 
description  of  the  pen-injector  design  and  the  conformance  to  the  relevant  standards  are  also 
considered acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Overall, the manufacturing process for Saxenda has been sufficiently described and validated. Critical 
steps in the production have been adequately identified and are monitored by in-process controls. 
Satisfactory  process  validation  has  been  conducted  verifying  that  the  manufacturing  process  is 
capable  of  consistently  and  reproducibly  producing  liraglutide  6.0  mg/ml,  3  ml  cartridge  in  the 
pen-injector of the predetermined quality.

Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  product  including: 
identity, content and purity of the product. The analytical methods have been described and validated 
according to ICH guidelines, where applicable. 
The pen-injector was developed in accordance with relevant ISO standards. The presented certificates 
of the Notified Body Lloyds Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) are adequate.   
Batch  analytical  data  from  the  production  sites  have  been  provided.  These  cover  batches  used  in 
pre-clinical, clinical and stability studies. The results demonstrate compliance with the specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability of the finished product (manufacturing scale batches) in the 3 ml cartridge has been studied 
under long term (2-8°C) and accelerated conditions . In-use stability has been acceptably studied as 
well. Two additional studies, including one photostability study, were performed. The influence of light 
was investigated in the primary (3 ml cartridge) and secondary (pen-injector) packaging intended for 
the market. As expected, the primary container does not provide adequate protection from exposure 
to light but the pen-injector with the cap on provides adequate protection of the finished product in 
the primary container. 
The results provided support the proposed shelf life of 30 months at 2-8°C and a subsequent in-use 
period of one month at room temperature (not above 30°C) or in a refrigerator (2-8°C).  
Adventitious agents 
No animal derived raw materials or excipients are used in the production of liraglutide. The TSE and 
viral safety evaluation covers the complete manufacturing process. Liraglutide is produced in yeast 
cells, which are not a natural host for human viruses. The manufacturing and formulation of liraglutide 
finished product does not include any additional animal derived raw materials or excipients. 
Thus, the overall conclusion of this adventitious agents safety evaluation is that the finished product 
is safe with regard to both viral and TSE agents. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  Quality  documentation  on  Saxenda  (liraglutide)  supports  assurance  of  acceptable  product 
quality.  
Liraglutide  is  already  marketed  under  the  brand  name  Victoza  indicated  for  treatment  of  type  2 
diabetes mellitus. The manufacturing process and composition of the active substance and finished 
products is identical. The pen-injector is new compared to Victoza.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical studies of liraglutide from the development program for the use of liraglutide in patients 
with T2DM (Victoza, EMEA/H/C/001026) have been submitted within this application. For the current 
procedure,  additional  non-clinical  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed 
specifically  for  the  liraglutide  obesity  program  to  assess  how  liraglutide  affects  the  energy  intake 
related  mechanisms,  and  from  where  within  the  brain  and  nervous  system  such  effects  may  be 
mediated. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Liraglutide  is  a  long-acting  GLP-1  analogue,  designed  to  bind  to  albumin  as  the  main  molecular 
mechanism of protraction. In  vitro, this was shown in the receptor cAMP as well as binding assay 
where  addition  of  albumin  right-shifted  the  dose-response  and/or  binding  curve.  The  apparent 
reduced potency of liraglutide underlines that only the free fraction of liraglutide is responsible for its 
pharmacological effect in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, liraglutide in a pharmaceutical solution 
forms a micell-like heptamer which may contribute to the slow absorption from the subcutis.  
Liraglutide is a potent, selective and efficacious agonist on the human as well as mouse, rat, rabbit, 
pig and Cynomolgus monkey GLP-1 receptor. Liraglutide has been shown to exert a number of actions 
in  vitro  that  are  known  to  be  specific  GLP-1  effects.  Liraglutide  has  also  been  shown  to 
glucosedependently  stimulate  insulin  secretion  from  isolated  β-cell  islets  in  vitro.  Liraglutide 
attenuated β-cell apoptosis in vitro under adverse conditions with high concentrations of free fatty 
acids and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, a proliferative effect on primary rat β-cells could be 
demonstrated for liraglutide in vitro whereas no consistent effect was observed under hyperglycaemic 
conditions in vivo. 
In vivo, liraglutide lowers blood glucose and body weight in a number of diabetic and obese models 
using  rodents,  pigs  and  monkeys.  The  mechanism  of  action  in  vivo  involved  glucose-dependent 
increase in insulin secretion, lowered glucagon secretion, decreased gastric emptying, loss of body 
fat,  lowered  food  intake,  altered  food  preference,  and  maintained  energy  expenditure.  The 
mechanism of action is consistent with a specific GLP-1 effect. 
For the current procedure for the indication of obesity, a number of new studies were performed to 
elucidate the mechanism by which liraglutide acts to reduce energy intake.  
Administration  of  liraglutide  resulted  in  activation  of  some  regions  of  the  brain  as  measured  by 
increased expression of immediate early gene cFOS. This activity was seen in the area postrema (AP) 
and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brain stem, the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) 
and  the  central  amygdala  (CeA)  in  the  midbrain  and  the  paraventricular  nucleus  (PVN)  in  the 
hypothalamus;  areas  known  to  be  involved  in  energy  intake.  Dosing  in  rats  further  revealed  a 
decrease in the hunger signals neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AGRP) in arcuate 
nucleus (ARC), to normal levels, whereas these signals are increased in obese rats. The satiety signal, 
cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) was increased after liraglutide treatment to 
even higher levels than normal. These data indicate that liraglutide has an effect on the brain, and in 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 16/91 
 
 
 
mice it was shown that liraglutide is present in some parts of the brain devoid of blood brain barrier; 
the circumventricular organs (median eminence (ME) in the hypothalamus, the area postrema (AP) 
and  the  subfornical  organ  (SFO)  in  the  brainstem,  and  the  vascular  organ  of  the  terminal  field 
(VOLT)), where is binds to GLP-1 receptors. To a lesser extent liraglutide was also measured in the 
ARC  and  especially  after  chronic  administration  in  the  paraventricular  nucleus  (PVN)  and  the 
dorsomedial region (DMH). A similar pattern was seen in the monkey brain. 
Further studies in rats revealed that the effect of liraglutide is not mediated solely by the AP or the 
PVN,  since  rats  lacking  these  areas  were  still  responsive  to  treatment.  Likewise  rats  with  a 
dysfunctional vagal nerve also responded to liraglutide treatment, indicating that the vagal nerve is 
not the main mediator of the effect. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Liraglutide had no cross-reactivity to a panel of 75 different receptors and ion channels. Moreover, it 
displayed no affinity to other closely related receptors in the glucagon-receptor super family including 
receptors for glucagon, GLP-2, secretin, GHRH, VIP and PACAP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology programme, focusing on central nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular 
systems and renal function, raised no serious issues. Liraglutide was well tolerated, especially in mice 
and monkeys. The only effects observed were confined to the rat. These adverse effects consisted of 
decreased  specific  urinary  gravity  and  osmolality,  accompanied  by  a  dose-dependent  increase  in 
urine volume and electrolyte excretion. With respect to the cardiovascular system, liraglutide (at 0.2 
and 2.0 mg/kg) induced dose-related increases in blood pressures and heart rate in rats, which were 
generally  maintained  for  up  to  24  hours  after  dosing.  Moreover,  body  temperature  was  slightly 
reduced at 0.2 mg/kg and significantly reduced for 13.5 hours at 2.0 mg/kg. According to previous 
studies  performed  in  rodents,  the  rat  is  especially  sensitive  to  GLP-1  agonists,  since  no  adverse 
effects on the cardiovascular and renal system have been observed in other animals or humans. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Liraglutide  has  been  shown  to  lower  blood  glucose  synergistically  in  combination  with  the  PPARγ 
agonist  pioglitazone,  and  to  increase  insulin  secretion  synergistically  in  combination  with  the 
sulphonylurea  glipizide.  Although  no  considerable  effect  on  blood  glucose  was  obtained  with  the 
liraglutide-atorvastatin combination treatment in severely diabetic and insulin-resistant ZDF rats, a 
number  of  critical  diabetic  parameters  were  improved.  Concomitant  liraglutide  and  metformin 
treatment did not give rise to any additive effect on blood glucose during a 15-day study in ob/ob rats. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide has been studied adequately. RIA and ELISA methods were used 
in the analyses performed.  
Liraglutide was well absorbed from the injection site after a single subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
Overall bioavailability following SC administration was estimated to be 53% in monkey, 76% in pig 
and 55% in human. The distribution volume is low and close to plasma volume, which indicates that 
a  high  fraction  of  liraglutide  is  circulating  in  plasma.  All  species  except  Sprague  Dawley  rats 
demonstrated  a  plasma  protein  binding  of  approximately  99%  or  higher.  The  plasma  proteins 
responsible for the high degree of observed plasma protein binding were HSA (99.4%) and  AAGP 
(99.3%).  
The  observations  are  consistent  among  species  and  demonstrate  linear  pharmacokinetics  of 
liraglutide with dose-proportional exposures as measured by Cmax and AUC values or an exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 17/91 
 
 
 
slightly higher than dose-proportional. No apparent gender-related differences were observed in the 
animal species. Following repeated administration of liraglutide to mice, rats and monkeys, only a 
minor tendency towards accumulation was observed. The accumulation ratio was comparable to that 
observed in humans (<2).  
The terminal half-life of liraglutide seems to be similar in pigs (
14 h) and humans (
15 h) while 
shorter in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys (4-8 h). Several studies in monkeys, pigs and humans 
∼
∼
indicated that extravascular administration (SC and pulmonary) of liraglutide prolongs the terminal 
half-life as compared to intravenous (IV) administration. Furthermore, the terminal half-life seemed 
also to be prolonged by repeated dosing in rats, monkeys, pigs and humans. This tendency was not 
apparent for mice and rabbits. The observed time to the maximum concentration seemed also to be 
affected by repeated dosing in some studies. The differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters can 
be explained by the study design or absorption rate limited kinetics (in the latter case following SC 
administration in pigs and humans).  
A  low  distribution  of  radioactivity  was  detected  when  comparing  the  results  from  administration 
of 125I-liraglutide, 14C-liraglutide and 3H-[Pal]-liraglutide with radioactivity predominantly detected in 
plasma. This is in accordance with what would be expected for this type of molecule and correlates 
well with the low volume of distribution found for liraglutide in monkey, pig and human.  
The metabolic and excretion patterns were highly similar across species with liraglutide being fully 
metabolised in the body by sequential cleavage of small peptide fragments and amino acids. The in 
vitro  metabolism  studies  indicate  that  the  initial  metabolism  involves  cleavage  of  the  peptide 
backbone  with  no  degradation  of  the  glutamate-palmitic  acid  side-chain.  Mice,  rats  and  monkeys 
displayed similar plasma profiles and showed no significant gender differences. A higher number of 
metabolites were observed in plasma from the animal species (especially the rat and monkey) as 
compared  to  human  plasma.  This  disparity  can  partly  be  explained  by  differences  in  the  sample 
preparation  as  human  plasma  samples  were  freeze  dried  prior  to  analysis  causing  a  removal  of 
volatile metabolites (including tritiated water). All detected metabolites were minor and obtained in 
low  amount  (<15%)  and  therefore  no  structural  identification  of  these  was  performed.  This  is 
acceptable  since  the  metabolites  are  only  formed  in  low  amounts  and  since  the  metabolites  are 
expected to resemble endogenous substances with well-known metabolic pathways.  
Clearance of liraglutide is suggested to take place by multiple organs/tissues and a low potential for 
pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  related  to  CYP  and  protein  binding  has  been  demonstrated. 
Liraglutide crosses the placental barrier in rats and rabbits. However, the uptake of liraglutide into the 
amniotic  fluid  and  foetuses  is  low  (<9%).  Liraglutide  is  secreted  into  milk,  but  the  amount  of 
liraglutide that a pup would receive per day via breast milk is low (at most 3% of the maternal dose). 
This information is reflected in section 4.6 of the SPC.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose studies were performed in mice and rats in standard design studies and in monkeys in a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study. A single dose of 10 mg/kg was generally well tolerated by mice 
and rats without mortality. In monkeys, a single SC administration of 5 mg/kg was well tolerated 
without mortality. The observed reductions in body weight and food consumption can be regarded as 
pharmacologically mediated. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Pivotal repeat dose studies were performed in mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015

Liraglutide  was  well-tolerated  in  rats  and  monkeys  with  NOAEL  values  corresponding  to  plasma 
exposure levels approximately 8- and 70-fold higher than observed in the clinic, respectively. In all 
species, decreased body weight gain and food consumption were seen in the first weeks of dosing. 
These effects are result of the pharmacological action of liraglutide. Following this initial period, in 
general, the animals resumed a more “normal” growth pattern (i.e. comparable to that of the control 
group)  and  food  consumption.  In  rats,  males  seemed  more  affected  than  females.  A  slight  trend 
towards  increased  effects  in  males  was  also  noted  in  the  monkey.  Some  effects  on  haematology, 
clinical chemistry and sometimes also urine were seen. However, the effects were generally small, 
and for most parameters there was no consistent pattern across the studies. Histological examination 
did  not  reveal  any  clear  treatment-related  effects  apart  from  C-cell  hyperplasia  in  the  thyroid  of 
treated mice seen after 9-13 weeks of dosing. Effects on C-cells (focal accumulations of C-cells) were 
already  seen  in  the  4-week  mice  study  but  these  findings  were  not  considered  to  be 
treatment-related. No effects on C-cells were seen in the rat and monkey studies up to 26 and 52 
weeks. 
An increased pancreatic weight was observed in cynomolgus monkeys following 52 weeks treatment 
at  plasma  exposure  levels  below  and  8-9-fold  higher  than  is  observed  in  the  clinic,  respectively. 
Further investigations of the pancreatic tissues collected in the 52-week monkey study showed that 
the  increased  pancreatic  weight  was  due  to  a  67%  increase  in  absolute  duct  cell  mass  and  64% 
increase in exocrine cells when compared to the vehicle group. Considering that concerns have been 
raised regarding the potential induction of acute pancreatitis following treatment with GLP-1 receptor 
agonists,  there  was  a  request  to  evaluate  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  finding.  The  applicant 
substantiated that the statistical significant differences in pancreatic weight observed in mid and high 
dose animals were driven by the pancreas weight of the controls, which was low compared to that of 
the CRO historical control data. Moreover, normal histological morphology of the pancreas was seen 
in all studies and no clinical or biochemical changes were seen in any of the four non-human primate 
studies  and  also  there  was  no  histopathology  indicative  of  inflammation.  In  addition,  no  effect  on 
pancreatic weight was observed in the 87-week study. Based on the above, it was concluded that the 
findings  made  in  the  52-week  cynomolgus  monkeys  study  do  not  suggest  a  safety  concern  for 
humans with respect to treatment related pancreatitis. 
At the end of the 52-week monkey study, antibodies were found in a few monkeys which crossreacted 
with  GLP-1.  This  implies  that  an  immunological  reaction  against  the  body’s  own  GLP-1  could  be 
possible. Data on antibody formation will be reported in the PSURs.  
Toxicokinetics  
Toxicokinetic  analysis  was  performed  as  part  of  every  study  with  blood  samples  collected  and 
analysed  for  the  presence  of  liraglutide.  Liraglutide  was  not  detected  in  blood  samples  of  control 
animals. In the 26-week rat study, only two animals per sex were subjected to blood sampling and the 
samples  were  collected  pre-dosing.  This  is  not  in  line  with  CPMP/SWP/1094/04  “Guideline  on  the 
evaluation of control samples in non-clinical safety studies” but the study was conducted before the 
release of the guideline.  
Genotoxicity 
Results of the Ames test, the in vitro chromosome aberrations assay and the in vivo micronucleus 
tests indicate no genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
In carcinogenicity studies, C-cell tumours were observed in mice and rats. A NOAEL value for these 
findings was established in mice at 0.2 mg liraglutide/kg/day, which results in plasma exposure levels 
similar  to  what  is  obtained  in  the  clinic.  A  NOAEL  value  was  not  established  in  rats.  A  number  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 19/91 
 
 
 
exploratory  studies  have  been  conducted  in  order  to  evaluate  the  mechanism  behind  liraglutide’s 
nongenotoxic carcinogenic effect on rodent C-cells (see below). 
Uterus leioma and leiosarcoma were observed in mice but not in rats. Although there seemed to be an 
increased  number  of  tumours  in  treated  mice,  there  was  no  dose-response  relationship  and 
furthermore, mice are very sensitive to this tumour. Skin sarcomas were increased in mice at high 
dose.  In  many  of  these  animals,  sarcomas  were  situated  around  the  microchip  which  may  have 
influenced  their  appearance.  At  the  NOEL  of  1.0  mg/kg/day,  the  safety  margin  was  13.  In  rats, 
pituitary gland carcinomas in the anterior lobe as well as uterus stromal polyps were increased in high 
dose  females.  However,  when  benign  and  malignant  tumours  of  pituitary  gland  and  uterus  were 
combined, there was no relevant dose related effect. Furthermore, on an individual animal basis there 
was no relation between stromal polyps and pituitary carcinoma or adenoma. It is not considered 
likely that the pituitary carcinoma and stromal polyps are a risk for humans. 
An extensive package of mechanistic studies was performed to investigate the human relevance of 
the C-cell tumours which was considered of crucial importance and identified as a major objection 
during the procedure. In these studies, GLP-1 receptors were shown to be present in C-cells of all 
investigated species. GLP-1 receptors were present in higher amounts per cell in rat cell lines than in 
a  human  cell  line.  In  addition,  literature  indicates  C-cells  are  less  abundant  compared  to  other 
endocrine cells in human thyroid than in rodent thyroid. In rat C-cell lines, liraglutide induced cAMP 
and  calcitonin  secretion  (though  at  much  higher  EC50  than  exenatide).  In  a  human  cell  line,  the 
response was marginal. 
Using human thyroid tissue, co-localization of the GLP-1 receptor and calcitonin within C-cells was 
confirmed  by  double-staining,  while  GLP-1  receptor  mRNA  was  non-detectable  via  in  situ 
hybridisation in human C-cells. In all other mechanistic studies, the human TT cell line was used; 
however concerns were raised whether this cell line was representative for normal (non-transformed) 
human  tissue.  To  address  this  concern  a  new  study  was  performed  in  order  to  compare  GLP-1 
receptor mRNA content in thyroid extracts from human donors with levels in the TT C-cell line. It was 
however not possible to correct the calculated mRNA content for the ratio of C-cells to total thyroid. 
The species difference in GLP-1 expression was however confirmed by in situ ligand binding. Overall, 
data show that GLP-1 expression in human C-cells is likely to be low, but not completely absent. In 
mice, liraglutide produced a sustained increase in plasma calcitonin. An increase in calcitonin mRNA, 
indicating  increased  calcitonin  synthesis,  was  visible  after  2  weeks.  Focal  accumulation  of  C-cells 
which  was  not  considered  to  be  treatment-  related  started  to  be  visible  after  4  weeks. 
Treatmentrelated  C-cell  hyperplasia  was  observed  after  9  weeks.  C-cell  hyperplasia  was  also 
observed after exenatide continuous infusion up to 16 weeks, but not after bolus injections during the 
same period of time. 
In  rats,  increased  plasma  calcitonin  levels  were  observed  after  4  weeks  administration.  No 
information  was  provided  regarding  weeks  1-3  in  this  study.  After  a  single  dose,  a  decrease  was 
observed in plasma calcitonin after an initial increase. This lowering in calcitonin can be explained by 
a massive loss of calcium in the urine due to a marked diuretic effect of a single dose of liraglutide in 
rats. In a long-term study (up to 16 months), plasma calcitonin showed no overall consistent change. 
This may be because the half-life of calcitonin is very short in rats, approximately 4 minutes; this may 
have played a role in this respect that it may be difficult to observe increases in plasma calcitonin in 
rats; however, half-lives in other species are not mentioned. In rats, following long-term dosing, the 
increase  in  calcitonin  did  not  persist.  This  may  be  due  to  a  high  spontaneous  frequency  of  C-cell 
hyperplasia  in  combination  with  a  decrease  in  diffuse  C-cell  hyperplasia  in  aging  rats.  This  is 
supported by the higher incidence in control rats compared to control mice. In literature, spontaneous 
C-cell tumours have been reported to occur with high frequency in rats. Martin-Lacave (2002) reports 
a  frequency  between  16%  and  40%  in  most  strains  and  Kaspareit-Rittinghausen  (1990)  reported 
Assessment report

51.5  –  60%  in  Han:SPRD  rats.  Statistical  analyses  of  individual  animal  data  in  rats  revealed  a 
correlation  between  early  plasma  calcitonin  change  (day  0  to  day  28)  and  terminal  focal  C-cell 
hyperplasia  score.  In  addition,  the  early  calcitonin  change  was  clearly  larger  in  rats  that  later 
developed adenomas than in rats that did not. This finding supports the hypothesis that the C-cell 
hyperplasia  and  adenomas  observed  in  the  rodent  carcinogenicity  studies  are  caused  by  the 
continuous  release  of  calcitonin  due  to  persistent  activation  of  C-cell  GLP-1  receptors  and  the 
accompanying  increased  demand  for  calcitonin  synthesis.  The  possibility  that  an  additional 
mechanism  for  C-cell  stimulation  on  calcitonin,  not  related  to  GLP-1R,  may  exist  was  addressed 
during  the  procedure.  Data  regarding  a  large  number  of  receptors  and  ion  channels  indicate  that 
liraglutide only shows affinity to the GLP-1 receptor. 
C-cell hyperplasia started to occur from 28 days dosing in aged rats and from 210 days dosing in 
young  rats.  Adenoma  started  to  occur  in  both  aged  and  young  rats  from  210  days  of  dosing.  No 
changes in  C-cell mass were observed after 26 weeks in  young rats. In cynomolgus monkeys,  no 
effect of liraglutide on plasma calcitonin was observed up to 87 weeks. No C-cell hyperplasia was 
observed after 87 weeks (animals were 15-19 months old at start). No changes in C-cell mass were 
observed after 52 weeks (animals were 12-17 months old at start). Literature data indicate that if 
there  would  have  been  evidence  for  a  carcinogenic  mechanism  in  monkeys  based  on  C-cell 
proliferation in response to receptor stimulation, it would have been visible within these periods of 
time. 
It is concluded that the findings in rodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor 
mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is likely to 
be low but cannot be completely excluded. Section 5.3 of the SPC reflects this information. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies were performed in rats in which male and female fertility and embryonic development were 
combined. Decreased body weight gain, decreased food consumption, and reduced faecal output are 
considered  due  to  the  pharmacological  action  of  liraglutide.  As  decreased  body  weight  gain  and 
decreased  food  consumption  can  be  considered  desired  effects  of  liraglutide,  they  were  not 
considered adverse effects in the determination of the NOAEL. Fertility parameters were not affected 
except for a slight decrease in the number of live implants/ slight increase in early embryonic deaths 
at 1.0 mg/kg. In the foetuses, a slight increase in skeletal variations was observed. The safety margin 
for the effects on live implants and foetal effects was 3. In a pre and postnatal study in rats, in F0 
animals,  pharmacologically  mediated  effects  were  observed  on  body  weight  gain  and  food 
consumption.  In  F1  animals,  a  decreased  weight  gain  was  observed  in  all  treated  groups  in  the 
pre-weaning  period.  Post-weaning,  at  high  dose,  a  slightly  decreased  body  weight  gain  was  also 
observed in F1 males up to week 16 and in F1 females during gestation and lactation but not in the 
pre-mating phase. In the F2 generation, a slight decrease in mean pup weight which was consistent 
among males and females was observed at high dose. This finding was not statistically significant, but 
considered remarkable because it suggests that there could be an effect on body weight up to the 
second generation. 
In embryofoetal toxicity studies in rabbits, a large decrease in food consumption was observed in 
rabbits. Again, decreased body weight gain, decreased food consumption, and reduced faecal output 
in the F0 generation are considered due to the pharmacological action of liraglutide. Foetal effects 
were a reduced foetal weight, an increase in the number of skeletal variations and a slight increase in 
the number of gall bladder abnormalities. There was no safety margin for these effects, but they may 
well have been due to the markedly decreased food consumption. 
No studies were performed in juvenile animals.

Local tolerance 
Single SC injection of liraglutide or vehicle in pigs caused a mild subacute inflammation in the injection 
site  tissue.  These  studies  evaluated  the  local  tissue  reaction  after  one  SC  injection  and  not  after 
repeated dosing or after IV, intramuscular or intra arterial injection. Repeated dose administration 
was sufficiently investigated in the repeated dose studies. Generally mild effects at the injection site 
have been noted in rats and monkeys in the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Local tolerance following intramuscular, IV or intraarterial injection was studied in rabbits, with no 
relevant  differences  between  liraglutide-treated  sites  and  vehicle-treated  sites  observed  after 
intramuscular  or  IV  administration.  Injection  site  reactions  consisting  mainly  of  perivascular 
haemorrhage and periarterial fibrosis/oedema were slightly more pronounced following intraarterial 
administration.  A  slight,  treatment-related  reaction  can  not  be  excluded  should  accidental 
intraarterial injection occur in humans. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity studies were not performed. This is acceptable as no relevant findings on the immune 
system organs were observed in the repeat dose studies, and immunotoxicity is not expected based 
on the mechanism of action. 
Metabolites 
The  major  metabolite  of  liraglutide  is  at  least  235-fold  less  potent  than  liraglutide.  All  human 
metabolites were also observed in the animal species studied in the toxicology studies and therefore, 
it is considered that these metabolites have been sufficiently investigated. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Liraglutide is a peptide, consisting of natural amino acids and a natural fatty acid. Therefore, 
liraglutide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical studies of liraglutide from the development program for the use of liraglutide in patients 
with T2DM (Victoza, EMEA/H/C/001026) have been submitted with this application. The 
pharmacological properties of liraglutide in terms of regulation of blood glucose have been already 
assessed previously in the initial Marketing Authorisation Application of Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026). 
For the current procedure, additional non-clinical primary pharmacodynamic studies have been 
performed specifically for the liraglutide obesity program to assess how liraglutide affects the energy 
intake related mechanisms, and from where within the brain and nervous system such effects may be 
mediated. 
Data from these studies indicate that liraglutide has an effect on the brain. Overall, the mechanism by 
which liraglutide treatment results in reduced energy intake is not completely understood. It is likely 
that liraglutide has a direct effect via the GLP-1 receptor on different areas of the brain, which are 
important in regulating signals for hunger and satiety. 
No additional safety pharmacology studies were submitted for the current application beyond those 
which had been undertaken for the development program for the use of liraglutide in patients with 
T2DM (Victoza) . The safety margins for the in vivo safety pharmacology studies top dose (2.0 mg/kg) 
resulted in plasma levels estimated to be approximately 15, 27- and 37 fold the Cmax in obese subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 22/91 
 
 
 
at steady state at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) at 3.0 mg (Cmax: 39 nmol/L; 
NN8022-3630), in mice (Cmax: 592,5 nmol/L; NN990267), rats (Cmax: 1044.9 nmol/L; NN990268) 
and monkeys, respectively.  
Liraglutide did not augment the proliferative effect of insulin detemir in an in vitro study in the breast 
cancer cell line MCF-7. No GLP-1 receptors were found on breast cancer cells (from breast carcinoma 
and several mammary cell lines). Artificial expression of the GLP-1 receptor in MCF-7 cells increased 
the proliferative capacity of this cell line. This is however considered not clinically relevant as GLP-1 
receptors were not found on breast cancer cells. 
No  additional  pharmacokinetic  studies  and  toxicology  studies  were  submitted  for  the  current 
application beyond those which had been undertaken for the development program for the use of 
liraglutide  in  patients  with  T2DM  (Victoza)  as  the  pharmacokinetic  and  the  toxicology  profile  of 
liraglutide has been investigated with those studies satisfactorily, to which the CHMP agreed.  
According to the documentation in the quality part of the dossier, the product may contain residues 
from leachables from the packaging of the product, comprising of xylenes and bromo-phenols. The 
amount of xylenes that can maximally be taken in by users of Saxenda is far below the Permitted Daily 
Exposure  of  21.7  mg/day.  For  bromo-phenols  no  limit  or  permissible  dosage  is  available,  but 
genotoxicity  has  been  satisfactorily  ruled  out.  Therefore,  no  relevant  risk  is  expected  for  these 
leachables.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  addition  to  the  non-clinical  studies  for  the  development  program  for  the  use  of  liraglutide  in 
patients with T2DM a number of studies have been performed to investigate the mechanism by which 
liraglutide acts to reduce energy intake. Although the mechanism is not fully elucidated, it is likely that 
liraglutide  has  a  direct  effect  via  the  GLP-1  receptor  on  different  areas  of  the  brain,  which  are 
important  in  regulating  signals  for  hunger  and  satiety.  No  further  pharmacodynamic  studies  were 
required by CHMP for this application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Liraglutide is a human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue obtained by derivatising GLP-1 with 
a fatty acid side chain. In this application the use of liraglutide 3 mg  for weight management was 
proposed. Liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg has been approved in several countries for treatment of 
type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026). 
The clinical pharmacology programme for weight management is based on the Victoza programme, in 
which  the  characteristics  of  liraglutide  at  doses  up  to  1.8  mg  were  comprehensively  evaluated  in 
healthy subjects and in subjects with T2DM. The initial dossier included four trials that evaluated the 
PK  and  PD  of  liraglutide  in  weight  management.  For  the  clinical  pharmacology  assessment  of 
liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management, the following trials have contributed with data: 
• 
• 
Trial 3630 (clinical pharmacology trial)

Trial  1922  (phase  3  trial)  for  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  and  exposure-response 
• 
analyses. 
As  only  few  additional  studies  were  performed  for  the  current  indication  for  liraglutide  in  weight 
management beyond those for the original Victoza application the assessment report is based on the 
studies  provided  for  Victoza  and  extended  with  the  additional  submitted  studies.  The  following 
subsections in the pharmacokinetics assessment were extended with the information from the weight 
management  program:  Methods,  Distribution,  Elimination,  Dose  proportionality  and  time 
dependency, Pharmacokinetics in target population, Special populations, and Interactions. 
The drug product used in all the clinical trials in the weight management development program, is 
identical to the drug product marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Victoza). Consequently, 
no  bioavailablity  or  bioequivalence  trials  have  been  performed  in  the  weight  management 
development program.  
Absorption 
The  absorption  of  liraglutide  following  subcutaneous  administration  was  slow,  reaching  maximum 
concentration approximately 11 hours post dosing. The injection sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm) 
can  be  used  interchangeably.  Absolute  bioavailability  of  liraglutide  following  subcutaneous 
administration is approximately 55%. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration is 22-25 L (for a person 
weighing approximately 100 kg). Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%).  
Metabolism/biotransformation 
During  24 hour  following  administration  of  a  single  [3H]-liraglutide  dose  to  healthy  subjects,  the 
major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were detected (≤9% 
and ≤5% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). Liraglutide is endogenously metabolised in a similar 
manner to large proteins without a specific organ as major route of elimination. 
Elimination 
Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or faeces. Only a minor 
part  of  the  administered  radioactivity  was  excreted  as  liraglutide-related  metabolites  in  urine  or 
faeces (6% and 5%, respectively). The urine and faces radioactivity was mainly excreted during the 
first  6-8 days,  and  corresponded  to  three  minor  metabolites,  respectively.  The  mean  clearance 
following s.c. administration of liraglutide is approximately 0.9-1.4 L/h with an elimination half-life of 
approximately 13 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with dose up to 3.0 mg. The accumulation ratio was 1.4 
to  1.8  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  elimination  pharmacokinetics  and  dosing  frequency  of 
liraglutide. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The coefficient of variation for AUCτ was 26% and the intra-subject coefficient of variation was 19%.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese subjects were consistent with that previously 
observed in the Victoza programme for T2DM and healthy volunteers. The average liraglutide steady 
Assessment report

state  concentration  (AUCτ/24)  reached  approximately  31  nmol/L  in  obese  (BMI  30-40  kg/m2) 
subjects following administration of 3.0 mg liraglutide in obese patients. 
Special populations 
The  exposure  of  liraglutide  decreases  with  an  increase  in  baseline  body  weight.  According  to  the 
Applicant, the 3 mg daily dose of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body 
weight  range  of  60-234 kg  evaluated  for exposure response  in  the  clinical trial  (see  clinical  part). 
Liraglutide exposure was not studied in subjects with body weight >234 kg. 
Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13-23% in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly lower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment  (Child  Pugh  score  >9).  Liraglutide  exposure  was  reduced  in  patients  with  renal 
impairment compared to individuals with normal renal function. Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 
33%,  14%,  27%  and  26%,  respectively,  in  patients  with  mild  (creatinine  clearance,  CrCl 
50-80 mL/min),  moderate  (CrCl  30-50 mL/min),  and  severe  (CrCl <30 mL/min)  renal  impairment 
and in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. 
Age and ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on 
the results from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from overweight and obese patients 
(18  to  82 years)  of  White,  Black,  Asian  and  Hispanic/non-Hispanic  groups.  Thus,  no  dosage 
adjustment  is  required  based  on  age  or  ethnic  origin.  Based  on  the  results  of  population 
pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 24% lower weight adjusted clearance of Saxenda compared 
to males. Based on the exposure response data, no dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. 
Saxenda has not been studied in paediatric patients (age <18 years).  
Interactions 
Liraglutide has shown very low potential to be involved in pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions 
related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding.  
The  small  delay  of  gastric  emptying  with  liraglutide  may  influence  absorption  of  concomitantly 
administered oral medicinal products. Drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with 1.8 
mg liraglutide. The effect on rate of gastric emptying was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 
3 mg, (paracetamol AUC0-300 min). Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol 
following a single dose of 1000 mg. Paracetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was 
delayed up to 15 min. No dose adjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required.  
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following single dose administration 
of atorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is required when given with 
liraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h 
with liraglutide.  
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single 
dose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. 
Dose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are 
not required.  
A single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 
16%;  Cmax  decreased  by  31%.  Digoxin  median  tmax  was  delayed  from  1  h  to  1.5  h.  No  dose 
adjustment of digoxin is required based on these results.  
A single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril 
AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with 
liraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
Liraglutide  lowered  ethinylestradiol  and  levonorgestrel  Cmax  by  12%  and  13%,  respectively, 
following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. tmax was delayed by 1.5 h 
with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of 
either  ethinylestradiol  or  levonorgestrel.  The  contraceptive  effect  is  therefore  anticipated  to  be 
unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.  
No  interaction  study  has  been  performed  with  warfarin  and  other  coumarin  derivatives.  Upon 
initiation of Saxenda treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives more frequent 
monitoring  of  INR  (International  Normalised  Ratio)  is  recommended  which  is  in  accordance  with 
Victoza. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
The primary PD of liraglutide 3.0 mg has been investigated in trial 3630, to investigate the effects of 
liraglutide 3.0 mg on gastric emptying compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg and placebo. Furthermore, 
effects on fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, glucagon parameters were explored, as well as 
the effects on energy expenditure, substrate oxidation rates, appetite ratings and weight loss were 
investigated. Further evidence comes from trials from the Victoza development. In Table PD1 an 
overview of the pharmacodynamic studies is displayed.

Study 3630  
Trial 3630 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, incomplete crossover trial designed to 
evaluate  the  effects  of  liraglutide  on  gastric  emptying,  appetite,  energy  intake  and  energy 
expenditure, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of liraglutide in obese, but otherwise 
healthy subjects. The trial had a 2-period incomplete crossover design and the 2 treatment periods 
consisted each of 5 weeks at home plus a subsequent 2-day stay in the clinic. The pharmacokinetic 
and  pharmacodynamic  assessments  were  conducted  at  the  2-day  stay  in  the  clinic.  An  inherent 
potential limitation of the incomplete crossover design is that no subject received all three treatments 
(liraglutide 3.0 mg, 1.8 mg or placebo). 
Participants were instructed not to change their diet, exercise program or daily routines during the 
trial  to  maintain  their  pre-trial  body  weight  to  minimise  the  effect  of  weight  loss  on  the 
pharmacodynamic parameters. A wash-out period of 6-8 weeks was included between the two trial 
periods to avoid any metabolic carry-over effects of a body weight loss. However, some weight loss 
was observed with liraglutide treatment during the 5-week period. The mean weight loss was 2.5 kg 
with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2.1 kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg compared to placebo. An impact of this 
weight loss on trial endpoints cannot be excluded. 
29 male and 20 female obese subjects were included in the trial. 
The ratio of paracetamol AUC0-300min between liraglutide 1.8 and 3.0 mg was 1.03 and since the 90% 
confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the  estimated  ratio  ([0.92  ;  1.15])  was  fully  contained  within  the 
pre-specified interval (0.80, 1.25), equivalence with respect to gastric emptying was demonstrated 
between the 2 groups. Equivalence was also observed between the two liraglutide doses and placebo.

There were no treatment-related differences in gastric emptying, as assessed by AUC0-300min,

compared to placebo; however, a reduction (23%) of paracetamol absorption in the first hour 
(AUC0-60min) of the standardised breakfast meal test was observed with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared

was slightly, but significantly reduced with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg compared to placebo (by 
3.0% and 4.9%, respectively) and substrate oxidation rate assessments indicated an overall relative 
shift towards more fat and less carbohydrate oxidation with liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg compared 
to placebo. 
Secondary/safety pharmacodynamics 
In QTc trial NN2211-1644, the effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarisation was assessed in healthy 
subjects with doses up to 1.8 mg. Liraglutide at steady state concentrations did not induce QTc 
prolongation and no exposure-response relationship between change in QTc and liraglutide 
concentration was observed.  
Liraglutide exposures, in terms of Cmax, obtained in trials 1839 (mean BMI 38 kg/m2), 1807 (mean 
BMI 34 kg/m2) and 3630 (mean BMI 34 kg/m2) with liraglutide 3.0 mg in the population of obese and 
overweight subjects overlapped with those obtained in healthy subjects in trial NN2211-1644 at lower 
body weights (mean BMI 25 kg/m2). However, the highest values for Cmax seen in trials 1807 and 
3630 were almost double the highest values seen in trial 1644. (Table PD2). Also in trial 1839, where 
PK values were obtained for 50 subjects, the Cmax range of trial 1644 was exceeded.  
As liraglutide elimination is not organ specific, conditions such as renal or hepatic impairment are not 
associated with higher plasma exposure of liraglutide.

GLP-1 agonists are known for their effects on heart rate. Likewise, liraglutide 3.0 mg increased the 
heart  rate  with  4-5  beats/min  during  the  day  and  6-9  beats/min  during  sleep  and  this  is  further 
discussed in the safety section. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Weight management programme vs type 2 diabetes (Victoza) programme 
The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese subjects were consistent with that previously 
observed in the studies to support the use of liraglutide in T2DM (Victoza development programme) 
and  healthy  volunteers.  The  average  liraglutide  steady  state  concentration  (AUCτ/24)  reached 
approximately 31 nmol/L in obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) subjects following administration of 3.0 mg 
liraglutide in obese patients. At 1.8 mg liraglutide in patients with T2DM, the average steady state 
concentration of liraglutide (AUCτ/24) reached approximately 34 nmol/l. 
At  liraglutide  1.8  mg  the  AUCτ  and  Cmax  were  between  650-1050 nmol*h/L  and  36-55  nmol/L, 
respectively in healthy volunteers. At liraglutide 1.8 mg the AUCτ and Cmax were approximately 546 
nmol*h/L  and  265  nmol/L,  respectively  in  obese  volunteers  (study  3630).  In  study  3630  after 
administration of 3.0 mg liraglutide to obese subjects, the AUCt and Cmax at steady state were 743 
nmol*h/L and 36.8 nmol/L, respectively. 
This is corresponding to the observation in the population pharmacokinetic analysis that showed a 
44%  lower  exposure  (corresponding  to  78%  higher  CL/F)  for  a  subject  weighing  234  kg  (the 
maximum observed weight) relative to a reference weight of 100 kg. Likewise, the exposure was 41% 
higher  (corresponding  to  29%  lower  CL/F)  for  a  subject  weighing  60  kg  (the  minimum  observed 
weight) relative to the reference weight. 
Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese or overweight subjects were 
overall similar to that for liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg in healthy subjects and subjects withT2DM. 
Liraglutide  3.0  mg  generally  resulted  in  higher  exposure  than  liraglutide  1.8  mg  in  obese  and 
overweight subjects and the exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. As 
expected, and seen previously with liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg, gender and body weight were 
the main covariates for liraglutide exposure: exposure decreased with increasing body weight and 
was lower in male than in female subjects. Dose (as covariate for dose-normalised AUC), age, race, 
ethnicity and glycaemic status were found not to be relevant covariates for exposure.  
The  Applicant  recognised  several  factors  which  influence  the  exposure  to  liraglutide  for  instance 
gender  and  weight,  also  in  lesser  extent  T2DM  and  injection  site,  albeit  they  are  considered  non 
clinically relevant when evaluated separately. There might be a risk that in extreme scenarios the 
exposure is either too low or too high to be in the therapeutic window. This is of special importance as 
the  efficacy  in  the  clinical  study  for  obese  males  seems  to  be  decreased  compared  to  the  female 
population.  The  Applicant  has  addressed  this  question  by  presenting  a  multivariate  analysis  of 
exposure in extreme scenarios. Overall, the conclusion of this is that the clinical effect on body weight 
in females is generally better than in males for all weight categories. With increasing body weight, 
absolute weight reduction increases while relative weight reduction decreases. This is likely related to 
lower exposures in higher-weight subjects. Nevertheless, the results are not considered to pose any 
clinical relevant problems as the proposed stopping rule will ensure that patients without clinically 
relevant benefit of the treatment will be terminated within 16 months. 
Similar  effect  on  absorption  of  concomitantly  administered  oral  drugs  is  anticipated  for  liraglutide 
3.0 mg and 1.8 mg as equivalence in 5-hour gastric emptying has been demonstrated between the 
two liraglutide doses (study 3630). Consequently, as no dose adjustment was found to be required for 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 30/91 
 
 
 
co-administration of oral drugs in the Victoza drug-drug interaction programme with liraglutide 1.8 
mg, it is concluded that the same applies with liraglutide 3.0 mg. The comparable pharmacokinetic 
characteristics for liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese or overweight subjects with that previously found for 
liraglutide in doses up to 1.8 mg in healthy subjects and subjects with T2DM, support the reference to 
the clinical pharmacology characteristics of liraglutide as provided in the Victoza programme. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic trial 3630 in the Saxenda intervention programme overall has an appropriate 
study  design.  Since  the  study  was  powered  on  the  primary  endpoint  (gastric  emptying),  the 
secondary endpoints should be interpreted with caution, because no correction for multiple testing 
was performed. 
Equivalence  in  gastric  emptying  between  liraglutide  3.0  mg,  liraglutide  1.8  mg  and  placebo  was 
demonstrated with AUC of acetaminophen over 5 hours. AUC(0-300) of acetaminophen is considered 
an established marker for gastric emptying, albeit scintigraphy is known as the gold standard. Tmax 
and Cmax of the PK of acetaminophen are also considered established markers for the investigation 
of  the  effect  of  drugs  on  rate  and  extent  of  gastric  emptying.  In  this  study  a  lower  Cmax 
acetaminophen  was  found  for  liraglutide  1.8  mg  compared  to  placebo,  no  difference  was  found 
between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo. Furthermore, the first hour gastric emptying was delayed in 
liraglutide  3.0  mg  and  1.8  mg  versus  placebo.  From  the  Victoza  investigation  programme  it  was 
known that, although there were differences in Cmax and tmax, the overall exposure to medication 
(AUC) was comparable for the tested medications. 
This study confirms the effect of liraglutide on satiety. This can partly be explained by delayed gastric 
emptying, but probably other mechanisms, in paricular effects of GLP-1 on the brain play a role. This 
leads to less caloric intake of circa 140 kcal/meal, which seems clinically important.  
There  was  a  small  effect  of  liraglutide  treatment  on  TEE.  In  the  clinical  studies  it  is  difficult  to 
disentangle direct effects of liraglutide on TEE and indirect effects of liraglutide on TEE, but it is likely 
that  the  decrease  in  TEE  is,  at  least  in  part,  explained  by  changes  in  body  weight  (and  possible 
changes in physical activity). Furthermore, from these data, no real benefit is observed for liraglutide 
3.0 mg compared to 1.8 mg. 
Based on this pharmacodynamic study and the trials in the Victoza intervention program, there is a 
clear benefit for liraglutide 1.8 mg or 3.0 mg compared to placebo on fasting and postprandial glucose 
levels, as well as on postprandial insulin response. However, there is no clear benefit for liraglutide 3.0 
mg over liraglutide 1.8 mg. There was a small difference in iAUC glucose in favour for liraglutide 3.0 
mg compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg. 
Overall,  the  study  design  of  the  thorough  QTc  trial  1644  was  acceptable  using  an  open-label 
positive  control  (moxifloxacin).  The  mean  Cmax  levels  of  liraglutide  were  comparable  for  1.8  mg 
liraglutide used in lean subjects in trial 1644 and for liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese subjects in trials 1807 
and 3630. However, in accordance with ICH E14 it is customary to provide data of supra-therapeutic 
doses in the investigation programme of a new product to study QTc. In the Victoza development 
programme  doses  up  to  1.8  mg  were  assessed,  which  is  even  lower  than  this  therapeutic  agent, 
Saxenda. In the phase 2/3 program, much higher values for Cmax were seen than in the QTc trial.  
It is difficult to extrapolate findings from the T2DM programme (QTc trial with maximum dose 1.8 mg) 
to  the  3.0 mg  dose.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  systematically  analysed  the  QTc  intervals  from  the 
available ECGs in a subset of European subjects from trial 1839. The mean treatment difference and 
90%  CI  between  the  baseline-adjusted  QTc  values  were  -0.31  ms  [-3.80  ;  3.18]  for  QTc  using 
Fredericia’s  correction  for  heart  rate  (QTcF)  and  4.46  ms  [0.59  ;  8.33]  for  QTc  using  Bazett’s 
correction for heart rate (QTcB). These are below the threshold level of regulatory concern, which is 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 31/91 
 
 
 
around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval around the 
mean effect on QTc of 10 ms.  
The liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment effect on the QTcB interval observed may be due to the limitation of 
the Bazett correction method. Bazett’s correction overcorrects at elevated heart rates and hence is 
not an ideal correction. Liraglutide treatment is associated with a slight increase in HR. We agree with 
the company that Fridericia’s correction is more accurate in subjects with altered heart rates. Using 
the Fridericia’s correction, liraglutide 3.0 mg did not importantly prolong the QTc interval compared to 
placebo in the subset of subjects from the clinical trial 1839. 
In addition, the proportions of subjects with QTcF intervals ≥450, 480 and 500 ms as well as the 
proportions  of  subjects  with  changes  from  baseline  of  ≥30  and  60  ms  were  comparable  between 
liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo (for both QTcF and QTcB). 
Thus it was concluded that liraglutide 3.0 mg did not importantly prolong the QTc interval compared 
to placebo in the clinical trial 1839. 
There was a significant effect on heart rate in both studied dosages of liraglutide. This will be further 
evaluated in the safety part. 
After a short time follow-up there was no significant difference in change in body weight between the 
two  liraglutide  groups.  After  6-8  weeks  of  wash-out,  the  weight  loss  was  neutralised  to  baseline 
values, indicating no continuous effect after cessation of the medication. 
The  exposure-response  analyses  showed  that  increasing  exposure  to  liraglutide,  leads  to  greater 
weight  loss  both  in  obese  and  overweight  subjects  without  diabetes,  as  in  diabetic  subjects. 
Comparable  exposure-response  curves  were  seen  for  glucose  control  (HbA1c)  in  subjects  with 
diabetes, with more pronounced effects for subjects with higher baseline HbA1c values. 
The  risk  of  medications  such  as  insulin  or  insulin  secretagogues  to  cause  hypoglycemia  may  be 
increased when co-administered with liraglutide, even more explicit possibly, when liraglutide is used 
in a higher dose. This is further discussed in the safety section of this report. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  comparable  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  for  liraglutide  3.0  mg  in  obese  or  overweight 
subjects  with  that  previously  found  for  liraglutide  in  doses  up  to  1.8  mg  in  healthy  subjects  and 
subjects with T2DM, support the reference to the clinical pharmacology characteristics of liraglutide as 
provided in the Victoza programme. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Taken together, PD activity of liraglutide 3.0 mg has sufficiently been demonstrated in the Saxenda 
and  Victoza  intervention  program.  Equivalence  in  gastric  emptying  was  demonstrated  between 
liraglutide 3.0 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg and placebo, only a transitory delay in gastric emptying in the 
first  hour  was  observed  with  liraglutide  3.0  mg  and  of  smaller  magnitude  with  liraglutide  1.8  mg 
compared to placebo. Remarkably, a significant reduction in total energy expenditure was observed in 
liraglutide  treated  subjects.  Liraglutide  induced  weight  loss  mainly  acts  through  reduced  appetite 
sensations  and  therefore  less  energy  intake.  As  with  liraglutide  1.8  mg,  liraglutide  3.0  mg  has 
beneficial effects on fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose, insulin and glucagon levels. 
Cardiovascular related findings in safety pharmacology studies such as increased heart rate are a 
class effect of GLP-1 analogues and are further evaluated in the safety part.

In the Victoza (liraglutide 1.8 mg) QTc trial, no QTc interval prolongation was observed and QTc 
prolongation is not regarded as a concern in subjects with high BMI.

Trials NN8022-1807 extension, NN8022-1839, NN8022-1922, NN8022-1923 andNN8022- 
3970 (also known as SCALE trial program) 
Methods: 
The clinical development programme to evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide for weight management 
includes one phase 2 dose-finding trial (trial 1807) and four confirmatory phase 3 trials (trials 1839, 
1922,  3970  and  1923),  conducted  worldwide  and  involving  5813  obese  (BMI  of  ≥30  kg/m2)  or 
overweight (BMI of ≥27 kg/m2) subjects with or without T2DM. All were randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials.  
The clinical trial programme was designed both to assess the weight loss potential of liraglutide in 
several different clinical situations and to assess its effects on some of the comorbidities associated 
with obesity. Each of the trials had a specific focus that in composite allows a full understanding of the 
efficacy and safety of liraglutide in the treatment of obesity. 
The phase 2 trial (trial 1807) was designed to establish the most efficacious dose of liraglutide after an 
initial 20 weeks period of exposure followed by an interim analysis at 52 weeks, which was included to 
assess the persistence of response over 52 weeks. The full 104-week trial period provided an initial 
evaluation of long-term safety beyond one year.  
Three  of  the  phase  3  trials  (trials  1839,  1922  and  1923)  were  of  56  weeks  duration  (52  weeks 
exposure on target dose): 
• 
Trial 1839, the largest in the programme, was focused specifically on weight loss (56 weeks) 
and  the  effects  of  liraglutide  on  preventing  progression  of  pre-diabetes  to  T2DM  (an  additional 
104-week  treatment  period  for  subjects  at  high  risk  of  developing  diabetes  [i.e.,  subjects  with 
pre-diabetes  at  screening]).  This  extension  is  currently  on-going  and  is  not  be  included  in  this 
application (expected completion in February 2015).  
• 
Trial 1922 specifically focused on the effect of two different doses of liraglutide on weight loss 
and glycaemic control in subjects with obesity and diagnosed T2DM.  
• 
Trial 1923 was designed specifically to assess the ability of liraglutide to maintain weight loss 
induced by a low-calorie diet (LCD).  
Trial 3970, conducted in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), was a 32-weeks trial as the 
maximal weight loss with liraglutide was expected around 32 weeks based on the findings of trials 
1807 and 1923. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder, characterised by a decrease or total arrest 
in airflow in breathing during sleep, which is associated with comorbidities such as insulin resistance, 
hypertension, cognitive function and depression. Recent studies have shown that people with OSA

can benefit from weight loss and weight loss is considered a primary modality of therapy in a recent 
treatment guideline. 
The elements of the proposed indication closely follow the trial programme as described.  
The population for the trials is the target population for Saxenda, although this population is divided 
across several phase 3 studies. 
The common features of the various phase 2 and 3 trials are addressed in this section together. 
Objectives, outcomes and endpoints 
The set of efficacy trials have a consistent design and definition of endpoints. There are in general no 
concerns regarding definition or measurement of these endpoints.

Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoints of trials 1807, 1839, 1922 and 1923 were related to body weight, and included 
both mean and categorical changes in body weight (Table E2).  
Epidemiological studies have identified weight as a risk factor for a number of diseases, and have also 
shown that an increase or decrease in weight is associated with a corresponding increase or decrease 
in  other  risk  factors.  Demonstration  of  weight  loss  is  considered  to  be  an  appropriate  surrogate 
measure of efficacy in the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007) and hence a suitable primary 
endpoint. According to this guideline: 
Relevant decreases in certain risk factors associated with obesity have been seen with loss of 
• 
at least 5 to 10 per cent of initial weight. Demonstration of a significant degree of weight loss of at 
least  10  per  cent  of  baseline  weight  which  is  also  statistically  greater  than  that  associated  with 
placebo  is  considered  to  be  a  valid  primary  efficacy  criterion  in  clinical  trials  evaluating  new 
anti-obesity drugs. The company did not specify in the definition of the primary endpoint what weight 
change would be considered clinically relevant. This point was also raised in the 2008 CHMP scientific 
advice. 
Weight  loss  should  be  documented  both  as  actual  weight  loss  and  by  other  appropriate 
• 
measures (such as percentage body weight loss). Baseline weight may be used as a covariate in the 
analysis. A further illustration of the size of the treatment effect should be provided by looking at the 
proportion of responders in the various treatment arms - where response is more than 10% weight 
loss at the end of a 12-month period. Results should be discussed both in terms of their statistical and 
clinical significance. The company did not predefine the relation of weight loss to further benefits.  
Because of the hierarchical testing that was defined for the co-primary, weight-related endpoints, full 
power was available for the endpoint “10% weight loss responders” while controlling the type I error 
rate.

Secondary endpoints 
According to the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), choice of secondary efficacy variables 
should be justified by the Applicant and could include variables such as quality of life parameters, 
biochemical parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism as well as blood pressure, cardiac function 
and sleep apnoea episodes. An associated reduction in cardiovascular risk factor(s) is an important 
secondary end point (e.g. waist hip ratio). The selected secondary endpoints fit this profile. 
The maintenance of weight loss or the prevention of weight regain, after the plateau in weight has 
been reached, was adequately addressed in trial 1923 (after weight loss in run-in period) and 1839 
(re- randomisation after 1 year). 
Body weight 
According  to  the  guideline  (CPMP/EWP/281/96  Rev.1  –  2007),  measurements  using  accepted 
methods selected and justified by the Applicant should demonstrate that weight loss is associated 
with appropriate loss of body fat (as distinct from muscle or body water). Measurement of changes in 
body composition and in fat distribution can be useful to better define weight loss. Methods such as 
waist  circumference  measurement,  waist  to  hip  ratio,  magnetic  resonance  imaging  and  computer 
tomography  may  be  used  to  assess  abdominal  fat  content.  Items  to  consider  in  assessing  and 
discussing efficacy include the distinction between weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. Such 
measurements are systematically provided by the Applicant and are at least available for some of the 
trials. 
Risk Factors 
In line with the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), cardiovascular risk factors associated 
with  obesity  (blood  pressure,  lipid  profile,  glucose  homeostasis,  fibrinogen)  were  measured  and 
monitored. According to the guideline, if claims are made in relation to risk factors, any improvement 
should be clinically relevant and be independent of the effect on obesity, and studies in support of 
these claims should be conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines. However, the Applicant did 
not document appropriate threshold values for clinical relevance and did not specify if any changes 
were above what could be expected on basis of weight loss alone.  
Patient reported outcomes 
The Applicant employed suitable questionnaires for Patient reported outcomes, although complete 
documentation was not always achieved for some questionnaires.  
Participants 
According to the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), patients entering these studies should 
have a degree of obesity, which has been shown to be associated with a significant health risk and 
especially a risk of increased mortality. The study population will therefore depend on the degree of 
obesity and the presence of coexisting risk factors. Efficacy should be demonstrated in patients of 
both sexes. Obesity in otherwise healthy adult patients should be diagnosed on the basis of a body 
mass index (BMI) of 30 or more in both males and females. Patients with associated or secondary 
effects  of  obesity  (such  as  hypertension,  hyperlipidaemia,  diabetes  mellitus,  or  cardiovascular 
disease), should be considered for such studies if BMI is greater than 27. Trials should be designed to 
take  account  of  predictive  risk  factors of  morbidity  and  mortality  that  include  BMI,  adipose  tissue 
distribution (with an increased risk in the case of abdominal/android obesity), and association with 
other cardiovascular risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes or hypertension) and episodes of sleep 
apnoea. Prospective stratification for some of these factors may be appropriate. 
This guideline is closely followed by the definition of the inclusion criteria as applied by the Applicant; 
these criteria for BMI (>30 or >27 + co-morbidity) are also retained in the proposed indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015

Subjects with obesity that is secondary to endocrinologic disorders (e.g. Cushing’s Syndrome) or to 
treatment  with  drugs  that  may  cause  weight  gain  (e.g.  insulin,  psychotropic  drugs)  or  eating 
disorders were not included in the trials. The lack of data about these patients has been included in 
Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  The  other  exclusion  criteria  (including  those  related  to  suicidality)  are 
considered appropriate to ensure proper execution of the trial; not taking these criteria to the SmPC 
is accepted.  
Treatments 
Dose 
The 3.0 mg dose was selected prior to the phase 3 trials and implemented throughout. However, the 
long-term data in trial 1807 are based on treatment with 2.4 mg during part of the treatment period 
based on a preliminary choice. 
Comparator 
According to the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), studies adding active controls may be 
necessary,  when  standard  therapies  are  available.  However,  there  is  no  current  and  generally 
accepted  standard  pharmacological  approach  for  weight  management.  In  trial  1807,  orlistat  was 
included as an open label comparator. It is agreed with the Applicant, that placebo-controlled studies 
are currently appropriate. 
Since weight control can be achieved by a reducing diet, exercise and behaviour modification alone, 
the  use  of  a  placebo  group  is  necessary  to  show  clearly  that  the  drug  and  appropriate  non 
pharmacological treatments are more effective than the same non pharmacological treatment alone. 
This  was  correctly  implemented.  The  design  of  trial  1923  allowed  separating  the  effects  of 
non-pharmacological means and liraglutide.  
The placebo solution contained the same excipients and preservatives as the active drug product and 
therefore could under-estimate adverse effects including injection site reactions that are related to 
these excipients. 
Duration of treatment 
According to the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), the optimum duration of treatment is 
unknown. To date all studies suggest an immediate cessation of treatment effect as soon as treatment 
is  stopped.  Trials  documenting  the  effect  of  treatment  for  at  least  one  year  are  required  but  an 
applicant intending to demonstrate the effect of weight loss on morbidity and mortality would require 
a longer prospective study. 
Sample size 
Trial 1807 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  reasonable  for  a  Phase  2  trial.  The  trial  lacks  sensitivity  to 
dose-responsiveness of rare adverse events. 
Trial 1839 
With respect to 10% weight loss responders, the sample size would be adequate to detect 14% on 
liraglutide v 10% placebo, a difference of only 4% which would not be considered clinically relevant. 
On a continuous scale, a difference between liraglutide and placebo of 0.7 kg could be detected, which 
would also not be considered clinically relevant.  
It  seems  that  the  trial  was  actually  powered  on  a  fourth  primary  endpoint  of  progression  from 
pre-diabetes  to  diabetes  (of  relevance  to  FDA  requirements)  but  is  of  only  secondary  importance 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 38/91 
 
 
 
regarding EMA guidance (guideline CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 – 2007) and therfore this trial could be 
considered to be over-powered. 
Trial 1922 
With respect to 10% weight loss responders, the sample size would be adequate to detect a difference 
between  10%  for  placebo  and  20%  for  liraglutide  that  is  of  questionable  clinical  relevance.  The 
mentioned difference of 1.7 kg is below the level of clinical relevance. 
Trial 3970 
As no clinically relevant difference in sleep apnoea parameters is established in literature, the sample 
size was adapted to the expected difference in weight loss of 6 kg, based on previous trials. It is not 
clear whether this results in a clinically relevant change in sleep apnoea. 
Trial 1923 
The trial would be powered to detect a doubling of the number of subjects who maintain their weight 
after diet-induced weight loss compared to placebo. This endpoint is not defined as such in guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 – 2007). Instead, the guideline recommends looking at patients who lose 
>10% of their baseline weight. 
Randomisation 
There  are  no  concerns  regarding  randomisation  using  state-of  the  art  systems  (IVRS/IWRS). 
Stratification was appropriate to ensure proper distribution of baseline variables that are expected to 
be related to the outcomes; stratification by pre-diabetes status was recommended during the CHMP 
scientific advice (2008). 
Blinding 
Blinding was consistent with current practice in clinical trials. It must however be assumed that the 
(gastro-intestinal) adverse effects of liraglutide have unblinded active treatment in some cases. 
Trial 1807 was single blind after 20 weeks and open label after 52 weeks. Orlistat treatment in trial 
1807 was always given open-label.  
Statistical methods 
In  general,  the  approach  to  statistical  analysis  and  the  use  of  ANCOVA  are  supported,  as  was 
confirmed in the 2008 CHMP scientific advice.  
Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for the primary LOCF analysis only includes subjects with a valid post 
baseline efficacy measurement and as such is a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. An analysis 
of all randomised subjects with BOCF if no post-baseline assessment is available, was provided as a 
sensitivity analysis to better approach ITT. 
The Safety Set is defined as usual. 
Primary endpoint 
As explained in the guideline (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007), placebo-controlled trials for obesity 
usually have a high dropout rate; this is often explained by adverse events leading to withdrawal from 
active therapy and lack of efficacy leading to withdrawal from placebo. It is important to follow up 
patients  who  have  discontinued  treatment  to  facilitate  intention  to  treat  analysis.  If  this  fails, 
imputation of missing data becomes necessary. The Applicant chose LOCF as imputation method.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 39/91 
 
 
 
The Applicant used two approaches for estimating the LS means, in the first  two trials (1807 and 
1923) the LS means were calculated using equal weights for each factor, for the later three trials 
(1839, 1922 and 3970) the Applicant calculated LS means weighing for the sample size. The change 
was driven by availability of appropriate software and resulted only in minor changes.  
Sensitivity analyses 
The Applicant also provided a BOCF sensitivity analysis in which subjects gaining weight were imputed 
using LOCF. The effect of this is difficult to predict, as this may apply to more subjects on placebo 
treatment than on active therapy.  
The optimal treatment scenario is provided by the completers analysis which is also included. 
Secondary endpoints 
A large number of secondary endpoints were included in the trials, but multiplicity issues were not 
addressed for the individual trials. This was rectified by implementing a hierarchical testing procedure 
for some of these secondary endpoints which would be applied to the pooled analysis. In agreement 
with the FDA, the Applicant decided to accept these results as confirmatory only in the case in which 
statistical significance within trial 1839 alone was also achieved, to account for the fact that 2 (1807, 
1923) of the 5 trials to be pooled were already unblinded at time of specification of the hierarchy. 
Change of primary endpoints during conduct of trial (trial 1923) 
In trial 1923, 2 modifications to the endpoints of the trial were made to comply with FDA requests. 
These changes occurred well before unblinding and do no threaten the interpretation of the results 
from the trial. 
Dose response studies 
The dose selection for phase 3 is based on the results of trial 1807. However, because trial 1922 
includes data on the comparison of the currently approved dose (for Victoza) and the proposed dose 
(for Saxenda), these data are included here also. 
Figure E1 Mean weight loss (%) by liraglutide dose, difference to placebo –  
Trial 1807 and 1922 (T2DM) - 20 and 52 weeks  
The results from trial 1807, supported by trial 1922, confirm that weight loss is dose dependent and 
that the highest dose tested is the most efficacious. Doses higher than 3.0 mg may be even more 
efficacious, but this is not discussed by the Applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 40/91 
 
 
 
 
The comparison of safety (See safety section) between the various doses is more difficult, because 
the relatively small groups in trial 1807 (each <100 patients evaluable) are not very sensitive to rare 
adverse events that may still be important. While trial 1807 confirms that the safety of the 3.0 mg 
dose is acceptable for use in phase 3, the trial provides no evidence for equivalence of the 1.8 and 
3.0 mg doses for safety.

Design 
Trial ID: NN8022-1807  
EUDRACT No.:2006-004481-13 
This was a 20-week dose-finding trial, with 84-week extension and an interim analysis at 
52 weeks, conducted in 564 subjects with BMI 30-40 kg/m2, T2DM excluded. 
Randomisation was 1:1:1:1:1:1 (N=90-98 across treatment groups). The trial was 
performed at 19 sites in 8 European countries. 
This application focuses on the 52-week efficacy data. An evaluation of 20 and 52-week 
data is included with respect to liraglutide dose response. Data after 104 weeks are 
included in the evaluation of efficacy persistence. 
Week 0-20 (double blind; orlistat open label): Main trial, stratification by gender. 2-week 
diet and exercise run-in with placebo injections for all subjects prior to randomisation. 
Weeks 20-52 (single-blind; subject and investigator blinded, sponsor unblinded): 
Extension. Subjects who chose to enrol provided new informed consent and continued on 
randomised treatment.  
Weeks 52-104 (open-label): Extension, liraglutide/placebo-treated subjects were initially 
treated with liraglutide 2.4 mg in the open-label extension period, but were all gradually 
(as sites received Ethics Committee approval) changed to treatment with liraglutide 3.0 
mg based on discussion of the results of the planned 52-week interim analysis. 
Orlistat-treated subjects continued on orlistat.  
2-week follow-up period after trial completion.

This was the largest trial in the development programme and was designed to assess 
weight loss and the course of pre-diabetes associated with obesity. This trial represented 
approximately 70% of the total phase 3 population. The trial was conducted in 3731 
subjects with or without pre-diabetes with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with 
dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension, T2DM excluded. Randomisation was 2:1 (liraglutide 
N=2487: placebo N=1244). The 56-week main trial is completed; the 104-week 
extension for subjects with pre-diabetes at randomisation is on-going. The trial was 
performed at 191 sites in 27 countries in Europe, North and South America, Canada, Asia, 
South Africa and Australia. 
This application includes data from an analysis of the main period of 56 weeks (including 
both subjects with and without pre-diabetes at screening, as well as the 12-week 
re-randomisation period (for subjects without pre-diabetes at randomisation). 
Stratification to 56 weeks of treatment for subjects without pre-diabetes at screening 
(with 12-week re-randomised treatment period) or 160 weeks (with 12-week 
observational off-treatment follow-up period) for those with pre-diabetes, and also by 
BMI.  
Subjects on liraglutide completing 56 weeks were re-randomised to continue on 
liraglutide or switch to placebo. Those on placebo remained on placebo. 
Week 0-56 (double blind): Main study for subjects with or without pre-diabetes. 
Week 56-160 (single-blind; sponsor unblinded): Extension for subjects with 
pre-diabetes. 
All subjects were on a 500 kcal/day energy-deficit diet and increased physical activity 
programme throughout the trial, including 12-week re-randomised period.  
Subjects with pre-diabetes continue in the ongoing 160-week phase of the trial.

This trial was designed to investigate weight loss in obese or overweight individuals with 
diagnosed T2DM. In addition, this trial afforded the opportunity to compare the 3.0 mg 
dose of liraglutide to the 1.8 mg dose approved for the treatment of T2DM as Victoza. 
The trial was a 56-week double-blind weight loss trial conducted in 846 subjects with 
BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and with an established diagnosis of T2DM. Randomisation was 2:1:1 
(liraglutide 3.0 mg N=423: 1.8 mg [Victoza] N=211: placebo N=212). The trial was 
performed at 126 sites in 9 countries in the US, Europe and South Africa. This 
application includes data from the main period of 56 weeks and the 12-week 
off-treatment follow-up period, as well as an evaluation of liraglutide dose response. 
Stratification by background treatment and also by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% or ≥8.5%). 
628 subjects (74%) completed the 56-week trial (N=324 (77%) for liraglutide 3.0 mg, 
N=164 (78%) for liraglutide 1.8 mg, N=140 for placebo). A 12-week observational 
off-treatment follow-up period was included, in order to assess the effects of drug 
cessation on weight control, and possible withdrawal side-effects. All subjects were on 
a 500 kcal/day energy-deficit diet and increased physical activity programme 
throughout the trial, including the 12-week follow-up period.

Table E6. Summary of efficacy for trial 1923 
Title:  
SCALE™ – Maintenance. Effect of liraglutide on long-term weight maintenance and 
additional weight loss induced by a 4 to 12 week low calorie diet in obese subjects; A 56 
week randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-centre trial 
with a 12 week follow-up period.  
Study ID 
Trial ID: NN8022-1923; EudraCT No.: N/A 
Design 
Trial 1923 was distinct among the trials in this development programme as it was 
designed to determine if liraglutide 3.0 mg could maintain weight loss compared to 
placebo in subjects who lost at least 5% of their baseline body weight through a low 
calorie (1200 kCal) diet. In addition, liraglutide 3.0 mg was evaluated in regard to its 
ability to induce additional weight loss after the 1200 kCal diet was liberalised to a net 
500 calorie deficit compared to the subject’s baseline diet. 
This was a 56-week double-blind weight loss and weight maintenance trial conducted in 
422 subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with dyslipidaemia and/or 
hypertension, T2DM excluded. Randomisation was 1:1 (liraglutide N=212: placebo 
N=210). Only subjects achieving ≥5% weight loss during the 4–12 week run-in period 
on LCD were randomised. The trial was performed at 36 sites in the US and Canada. 
This application includes data from the main 56 week period and the 12-week 
off-treatment follow-up period. 
Stratification by comorbidity status (presence or absence of treated or untreated 
hypertension or dyslipidaemia) and also by BMI (≥30 kg/m2 or <30 kg/m2). 
305 subjects (72%) completed the 56-week trial (N=159 [75%] for liraglutide 3.0 mg, 
N=146 [70%] for placebo). A 12-week observational off-treatment follow-up period 
was included, in order to assess the effects of drug cessation on appetite and weight 
control, and possible withdrawal side-effects. All subjects were on a 500 kcal/day 
energy-deficit diet and increased physical activity programme throughout the trial from 
randomisation, including the follow-up period.

Trial ID: NN8022-3970 
UTN: U1111-1126-6260 
EudraCT No.: not applicable 
Design 
Trial 3970 was designed to determine if liraglutide 3.0 mg could reduce disease severity 
in obese subjects with moderate or severe sleep apnoea. The analysis of the results 
included investigation of the impact of weight loss on OSA and other sleep-related end 
points. This was the only trial where the primary endpoint addressed a co-morbidity of 
obesity (weight loss was a secondary end point) and the only trial of 32 weeks duration. 
Trial 3970 was a 32-week double-blind trial conducted in 359 subjects with BMI ≥30 
kg/m2 with moderate or severe OSA, T2DM excluded. Randomisation was 1:1. The main 
aim was to investigate liraglutide’s effects on severity of OSA in subjects unwilling or 
unable to use treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The trial was 
performed at 35 sites in the US and 5 in Canada. This application includes data from the 
full 32-week trial period.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis): 
Subject disposition 
Across all the trials, 5813 subjects were exposed to treatment: 3872 to liraglutide (including 3384 to 
the 3.0 mg dose) and 1941 to placebo. In addition, 95 subjects were randomised and exposed to 
orlistat in trial 1807. Approximately 70% of subjects completed the phase 3 trials: 72% treated with 
liraglutide and 66% treated with placebo. (Table E8) 
More subjects on liraglutide 3.0 mg discontinued due to AEs (9–11%) compared with those on placebo 
(3–4%); the proportions were similar between both groups in trial 1923 (~8.5%). Fewer subjects on 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (0-1% across the phase 3 trials) than placebo (1-3%) withdrew due to ineffective 
therapy, and fewer on liraglutide (6-11%) than placebo (11-20%) withdrew their consent to remain 
in the trial.  
In the pooled dataset, the rate of withdrawals is high, 29.6%. This number is consistent over all trials 
and expected for placebo-controlled trials of one-year duration in obesity. To investigate what 
happened to the withdrawn subjects after withdrawal, these subjects were asked to come in for a 
measurement at the nominal time point of their 56 week visit in the 56-week phase 3 trials (trials

1923, 1922 and 1839). Only 26.8% of withdrawn subjects came in for this visit and may potentially 
not be representative for all withdrawn subjects.

Baseline data 
In general, the baseline characteristics of the trials are consistent with the expected target population 
(Table E9). However, the representation of some subpopulations is limited: 
• 
• 
• 
Males were 28.8%. 
Subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2 were only 5.4% of the population 
Subjects ≥65 years of age were only 6.6% of the population and only 0.4% of the participants 
were ≥75 years. The oldest patient was 82 years. 
• 
Other races than White or Black (African American) represented 4.9% of participants.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints related to weight loss 
The development over time in body weight is similar in the various efficacy trials (Figure E2). The 
treated group shows a continuous weight decline with reaches a plateau after about 40 weeks. In the 
mITT pooled analyses using LOCF, weight loss was 7.5% (7.8 kg) with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. 2.3% 
(2.5 kg) with placebo, a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 5.2% [-5.53 ; -4.83]. The mean treatment 
difference in trials 3970 (4.15%) and 1922 (3.95%) was less than in the pooled dataset (5.24%). 
Trial 3970 had a shorter treatment duration of 32 weeks and subjects may not have reached the full

weight reduction attempts.

The data are supported by a range of sensitivity analyses. The most favourable scenario is 
represented by the Completers analysis. In this analysis the placebo-subtracted treatment effect for 
weight loss was 5.6%. As discussed before, no clean BOCF analysis was provided as possibly least 
favourable scenario; the modified BOCF analysis (weight gain imputed with LOCF) resulted in a 
placebo-subtracted treatment effect for weight loss of 4.5%. 
The likelihood of achieving a predefined response with liraglutide is greater for any weight loss in the 
range from -25% to +5%. The likelihood for achieving 10% weight loss was 30.5% for liraglutide

and 12.7%; the estimates counting early withdrawals as non-responders were 28.6 and 8.52% 
respectively. 
Secondary endpoints 
A large number of secondary endpoints were included in the trials. As discussed before, these are 
interpreted primarily in an exploratory sense. Most parameters changed in a favourable way, 
consistent with changes usually seen with weight loss. Only “pulse” (heart rate) showed an 
unfavourable change, which is discussed under safety. 
The results for the pooled analyses that were hierarchically tested are shown in Table E10.

Ancillary analyses 
Persistence of efficacy and effect of treatment discontinuation 
In trial 1839, subjects without pre-diabetes at screening were re-randomised 1:1 to either continue 
treatment  with  liraglutide  (liraglutide/liraglutide,  351  subjects)  or  to  switch  to  placebo 
(liraglutide/placebo, 350 subjects). The placebo group continued on placebo (304 subjects), and diet 
and exercise continued for all groups. 
Subjects who switched from liraglutide to placebo regained a mean 2.91% (2.63 kg) of body weight 
compared to 0.69% (0.61 kg) in those who continued on liraglutide (treatment difference: -2.18% [ 
2.60; 1.75], p<0.0001). After three months, weight loss in subjects who switched from liraglutide to 
placebo (6.77% [6.73 kg]) was greater than that achieved with diet and exercise alone (3.11% [3.29 
kg]).  
It would be expected that weight would return to baseline after treatment discontinuation. These data 
are consistent with that expectation, albeit that the baseline weight has not been reached yet after 
three months. 
As described before, the maximum effect with treatment occurs around 40 weeks. After that, small 
increases in weight are noticed. This may reflect the natural cause of obesity; from trial 1839 (after 
re-randomisation) it is evident that weight regain is worse with placebo compared to liraglutide.  
Early prediction of response 
The Applicant at the time of the submission of the dossier was of the opinion that a firm stopping rule 
is not clinically indicated for liraglutide, for reasons described below. Rather, it was proposed to let the 
physician make this evaluation based on the totality of the clinical effects observed after 12 weeks 
treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg (16 weeks including dose escalation).  
To support the above recommendation, the pooled data from the 2 largest phase 3 56-weeks trials 
(trials 1839 and 1922) were used to identify those subjects unlikely to achieve and sustain a weight 
loss of at least 5% of initial body weight after 56 weeks of treatment (‘non-responders’). Several 
‘early  response’  criteria  were  evaluated  (3,  4  and  5%  weight  loss  at  8,  12  and  16  weeks).  Only 
subjects  with  a  valid  body  weight  measurement  at  the  specific  time  point  were  included  in  the 
analyses.  Missing  data  were  imputed  using  the  LOCF  method  (primary  analyses),  or  counted  as 
‘non-responders’ (sensitivity analysis).  
The number and proportion of responders identified by the various criteria are shown in Table E11. 
The ‘overall correctly predicted’ number and proportion is shown in the far right column (number of 
correctly predicted responders plus number of correctly predicted non-responders). In evaluation of 
possible prediction criteria, equal weight will be put on positive and negative predictive value. With a 
low positive predictive value, a large number of subjects will be continued who would not in the end 
achieve response. While with a low negative predictive value, a large number of subjects would be 
stopped who would eventually have achieved response. Both are undesirable and it is not obvious 
which should be given most weight. From the results it can be seen that when requiring both good 
positive and negative predictive values the maximum values obtainable are just over 75% which can 
be achieved when using criteria of 3% weight loss at week 12 or 16 or 4% weight loss at week 16, with 
the 4% criteria by week 16 being marginally better, Table E11. Based on these results, the Applicant 
has  agreed  to  include  a  stopping  rule  in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC.  The  stopping  rule  states  that 
treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients 
have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight.

Comparison of results in sub-populations 
The  results  regarding  weight  loss  were  consistent  in  most  subgroups.  However,  the  treatment 
estimate for females (-5.83%) was better compared to males (-3.56%).  
When comparing subgroups based on baseline BMI, efficacy (% weight change) seems best in the 
lowest BMI subgroup. However, absolute weight loss is still higher in the high BMI subgroups. This 
discrepancy suggests that the effect is artificial. Surprisingly the results are slightly different for the 
genders. For males in the lowest BMI subgroup [27.0 ; 29.9 kg/m2] the LS Means outcome estimates 
were Lira 3.0 mg: n=56 baseline 90.90 kg; change -4.94 kg and Placebo: n=31 baseline 91.65 kg; 
change-1.83. The Treatment Contrast was only -3.19 kg [95% CI: -5.69 ; -0.69]. 
As discussed before, treatment effect in T2DM as assessed in trial 1922 was less than in the other 
1-year trials. Also in this trial the results for males (-2.93%) were worse than for females (-4.84%).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  relevant  CHMP  guideline  for  Saxenda  is  the  “Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
products  used  in  weight  control”  (CPMP/EWP/281/96  Rev.1  -  2007).  According  to  the  guideline, 
confirmatory phase III trials should be randomised, placebo controlled and double blinded, as done by 
the Applicant. The Applicant designed 4 different but similar trials which together provide an adequate 
overview of the benefits (and risks) that can be expected from treatment with Saxenda. The clinical 
programme  (including  the  focus  on  1-year  efficacy  data)  is  consistent  with  the  guideline  and 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 59/91 
 
 
 
                                                                                           
                                                                                           
The use of re-randomisation to assess the effect of treatment discontinuation (part of trial 1839) is 
considered a strong feature along with 3-months follow up in several other trials. 
Population 
The population in the trials based on obesity or overweight with additional risk factors is consistent 
with the guideline and representative of the target population. A large number of participants were 
included, such that several trials were powered to detect differences that are too small for clinical 
relevance  (e.g.  a  treatment  effect  of  0.7  kg  in  trial  1839);  these  trials  are  considered  somewhat 
over-powered. Of course, this reduces the width of the confidence intervals and provides welcome 
additional information with respect to safety.  
Subjects with obesity that is secondary to endocrinologic disorders (e.g. Cushing’s Syndrome) or to 
treatment  with  drugs  that  may  cause  weight  gain  (e.g.  insulin,  psychotropic  drugs)  or  eating 
disorders were not included in the trials. The lack of data about these patients has been included in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Imputation of the primary endpoint 
In the pooled dataset, the rate of withdrawals is high, 29.6%. This number is consistent over all trials 
and  as  expected  for  placebo-controlled  trials  of  one-year  duration  in  obesity.  Only  26.8%  of 
withdrawn subjects came in for the visit at the nominal end-of-trial. This emphasizes the relevance of 
the method for imputation of missing data, because 21.7% of subjects have missing endpoint data. 
The low follow up at 56 weeks is a major shortcoming of the trials; post-hoc correction seems not 
possible.  
The  Applicant  chose  LOCF  as  imputation  method  for  these  data;  however,  this  is  not  considered 
conservative; it can be expected that after treatment discontinuation, baseline weight will be reached 
again after a few weeks or months. Using LOCF will carry the nadir of the weight to the analysis, where 
BOCF is more conservative. 
The Applicant provided a BOCF sensitivity analysis in which subjects gaining weight were imputed 
using LOCF. The effect of this is difficult to predict, as this may apply to more subjects on placebo 
treatment  than  on  active  therapy.  Therefore  an  unmodified  BOCF  sensitivity  analysis  on  the 
randomised population was asked additionally and provided.  
Secondary endpoints 
A large number of secondary endpoints were included in the trials, but multiplicity issues were not 
addressed for the individual trials. Therefore the results of the individual trials can only be interpreted 
in an exploratory sense. The Applicant decided to accept these results as confirmatory only in the case 
in which statistical significance within trial 1839 alone was also achieved, to account for the fact that 
2 (1807, 1923) of the 5 trials to be pooled were already unblinded at time of specification of the 
hierarchy. Although this approach is a bit artificial, it can be accepted in the end. 
Trial 1807 extension data 
Trial 1807 is the only source of 2-years data in this MAA. The analysis of these data is hampered by 
several factors: 
• 
There was no placebo group. Treatments with orlistat and liraglutide were open label. 
The initial dose in the extension was 2.4 mg liraglutide, which was later adapted to 3.0 mg 
• 
liraglutide. About 1/3 of the time described is related to the lower dose. 
• 
• 
Subjects that do not tolerate the treatments do not participate in the extension. 
Only 47 subjects completed the second year of treatment with high-dose liraglutide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 60/91 
 
 
 
Thus the usefulness of these 2-year data is very limited. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose 
In the dose range that was investigated, the highest dose that was investigated in phase 2 (3.0 mg) 
was also the most effective dose, although the differences in the PD trials had seemed small. This 
dose was chosen for further evaluation in the phase 3 program. 
In T2DM patients, not only weight-related measures, but also parameters of glycaemic control are 
better with the new 3.0 mg dose compared to the established 1.8 mg dose (marketed as Victoza). 
However, no data are available on switching from Victoza (liraglutide 1.8 mg) to Saxenda (3.0 mg), 
hence  this  cannot  be  recommended.  Thus,  if  T2DM  is  the  major  clinical  consideration  and  weight 
management (or weight loss) is a secondary consideration, then the 1.8 mg dose is appropriate. In 
liraglutide-naïve  overweight/obese  subjects  with  T2DM  where  weight  management  is  the  major 
clinical consideration, the Applicant recommends liraglutide at 3.0 mg as the treatment dose, which is 
acceptable (and in accordance with the indication).  
Primary endpoint: weight loss 
The liraglutide-treated group shows a continuous weight decline with reaches a plateau after about 40 
weeks. In the mITT pooled analyses using LOCF, weight loss was 7.5% (7.8 kg) with liraglutide 3.0 
mg v 2.3% (2.5 kg) with placebo, a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 5.2% [-5.53 ; -4.83].  
The  data  are  supported  by  a  range  of  sensitivity  analyses.  The  most  favourable  scenario  is 
represented by the Completers analysis. In this analysis the placebo-subtracted treatment effect for 
weight loss was 5.6%. The unmodified BOCF analysis was provided as the least favourable scenario 
and  resulted  in  a  placebo-subtracted  treatment  effect  for  weight  loss  of  4.28%.  Using  the  weight 
regain imputation method, the treatment effect was estimated as -5.05%. 
The likelihood of achieving a predefined response with liraglutide is greater for any weight loss in the 
range from -25% to +5%. The likelihood for achieving 10% weight loss was 30.9% for liraglutide 
3.0 mg v 9.0% for placebo in the pooled 56-week trials. The estimates for completers were 38.2% 
and  12.7%;  the  estimates  counting  early  withdrawals  as  non-responders  were  28.6  and  8.52% 
respectively. 
The  results  regarding  weight  loss  were  consistent  in  most  subgroups.  However,  the  treatment 
estimate  for  females  (-5.83%)  was  better  compared  to  males  (-3.56%)  (a  statistically  significant 
interaction, p<.0001). The difference can be attributed to lower exposure in males. Treatment effect 
in  T2DM  as  assessed  in  trial  1922  (-3.95%)  was  less  than  in  all  1-year  trials  (-5.24%).  This  is 
explained  by  the  high  participation  of  males  in  this  trial.  After  correction  for  gender  effects,  the 
interaction is no longer statistically significant (p=0.1762) and is not considered to pose any clinical 
problems.

Secondary endpoints 
In T2DM patients, the HbA1c level was decreased by 0.93% compared to placebo. This result could be 
expected based on the known efficacy of liraglutide as an anti-diabetic product. This also resulted in 
a net reduction of use of oral anti-diabetic drugs; for such reductions, the protocol provided guidance. 
Counting both increase and decrease in use in the liraglutide and placebo groups, this affected about 
30% of the participants. Parameters of glycaemic control were also improved in non-diabetes patients 
(e.g. HbA1c by 0.23%), but the clinical relevance of this change (within the normal range) is doubtful. 
Both SBP (-2.9 mmHg) and DBP (-0.8 mmHg) were decreased compared to placebo. The decrease in 
SBP  for  each  weight  change  category  was  larger  with  liraglutide  than  with  placebo;  this  could  be 
explained by an effect of liraglutide on SBP that is independent of weight loss, but is likely also partly 
explained by different mean changes in each category between liraglutide and placebo. This change in 
BP  could  be  clinically  relevant,  but  is  offset  by  the  increase  in  pulse  rate;  the  outcome  of  the 
combination  of  these  effects  is  not  clear.  There  were  no  protocol  rules  for  change  in 
anti-hypertensives; the net change was favourable for liraglutide, but the difference was only 4%. 
Small changes were also seen in lipid parameters. The treatment ratio that is provided for LDL (0.973 
or 2.7% reduction) corresponds to an absolute change of 0.07 mmol/L (based on a baseline of 2.77 
mmol/L). Also use of lipid-lowering medications was reduced, but the net difference was 3.3%.  
The  interpretation  of  the  sleep-apnoea  related  parameters  is  difficult,  as  there  is  no  established 
margin for clinical relevance. The decrease in AHI was closely correlated to weight loss, as was known 
from literature. The decrease in ‘episodes’ was accompanied by statistically non-significant changes in 
the patient-reported outcomes.  
Pending clear evidence of outcome benefits attributable to liraglutide, patient-reported outcomes are 
relevant. The favourable change over time may be  biased by the burden of daily injections (‘with 
these injections, it must be effective’). The injections weigh in equally at end of trial for both active 
and placebo treatment. Therefore, the Quality of Life scales did not measure the burden of therapy 
caused by the injections as it is experienced by the patient. Of course, adverse effects like nausea do 
come up in the questionnaires. 
Although statistical significance was achieved on all these measures, it is important if these changes 
in  the  pooled  secondary  parameters  that  were  hierarchically  tested  are  clinically  relevant.  The 
improvements in glycaemic control and systolic blood pressure fulfill these criteria. On the contrary, 
the  effects  on  the  Quality  of  Life  scales  are  not  considered  relevant  for  the  SmPC  and  should  be 
excluded. 
Stopping rule 
As requested in the Day 120 LoQ, the Applicant investigated possible stopping rules, resulting in a 
proposal: 
Treatment effects with Saxenda should be evaluated after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose. If 
patients have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight, treatment should be discontinued as 
clinically indicated. 
To justify this rule, they have considered: 
• 
• 
weight loss after 8, 12 or 16 weeks of treatment 
gender 
baseline glycaemic status (trial 1922 in diabetic subjects vs. trial 1839 in subjects without 
• 
diabetes) 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 62/91 
 
 
 
According to the Applicant’s analysis, there were no major differences between the data at weeks 8, 
12  or  16.  This  is  indeed  confirmed  by  the  ROC  curves  that  do  not  show  any  clear  point  for  best 
predicting the weight loss responders. Based on these data and the similarity with orlistat, it is agreed 
to use the 5% cut-off-margin and the Applicant and the CHMP has agreed on the following wording for 
the stopping rule included in section 4.1 of the SmPC:  
Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients 
have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
After treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg, mean weight loss was 7.5% (7.8 kg) with liraglutide 3.0 mg 
vs.  2.3%  (2.5  kg)  with  placebo,  a  placebo-subtracted  weight  loss  of  5.2%.  When  applying  more 
conservative  methods  than  LOCF  imputation  for  missing  data,  a  treatment  effect  of  -4.28%  is 
estimated. Efficacy is less in males and in patients with T2DM.  
In  the  revised  target  population  and  for  subjects  meeting  the  criteria  of  the  stopping  rule,  the 
expected mean weight change is -10.82% after one year (not corrected for placebo). A response of at 
least 10% is achieved by 50.1%. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The analysis of safety is based on a pooled analysis of the phase 2 and 3 trials. Data from the clinical 
development program for Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026) for the use of liraglutide in T2DM are used 
supplementary and for comparison, which was found to be acceptable by CHMP. 
Patient exposure 
The  exposure  as  documented  in  the  weight  management  pool  includes  3872  patients  exposed  to 
liraglutide  for  the  proposed  indication.  Exposure  for  at  least  one  year  to  the  proposed  dose  is 
documented in 2341 patients. (Table S1)

During assessment, interim data from the placebo controlled extension of trial 1839 were provided. In 
total, in trial 1839 and its extension up to 1 Oct 2014, 903 subjects were exposed to liraglutide 3.0 mg 
for ≥2 years and 694 patients were exposed for 3 years.

Adverse events 
AEs reported by at least 5% of subjects in either treatment group are shown in Figure S1. 
Figure S1 Most frequent (≥5%) adverse events: Weight management pool 
%: Percentage of subjects experiencing at least one event; R: event rate per 100 PYE. Please note that AEs of 
hypoglycaemia are not included in this figure.  
The general AE profile is in line with the experience with Victoza. The most commonly reported AEs 
with liraglutide 3.0 mg were gastrointestinal disorders. Most patients experience nausea already in 
the first weeks of treatment, during dose titration. Other patients express decreased appetite, which 
is in line with the pharmacology of liraglutide. Also asthenic conditions like fatigue occur early and in 
increased incidence with liraglutide.  
The efficacy of dose titration to reduce GI side effects and to improve tolerability is not analysed in this 
dossier. Dose titration was implemented throughout the program. 
Hypoglycaemia 
High levels of GLP-1 have been implicated as potential mediators of hypoglycaemia in fasting patients 
after glucose administration (reactive hypoglycaemia) and after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery. 
Therefore, hypoglycaemia was observed carefully in the program. 
In subjects without T2DM, no severe hypoglycaemic events were reported. The proportion of subjects 
reporting AEs of hypoglycaemia outside the fasting FPG and OGTT visits was low, both with liraglutide 
3.0 mg (1.6% of subjects) and placebo (1.1% of subjects). Many hypoglycaemic episodes occurred 
after OGTT in these patients and were recognised by glucose measurement rather than symptoms. 
The circumstances of an OGTT can be considered non-physiologic and therefore, these events are less 
important. This is supported by the lack of hypoglycaemic AEs when tolerance to a mixed meal was 
tested instead of pure glucose. 
In  subjects  with  T2DM,  severe  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  by  0.7%  of  subjects  treated  with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (3 subjects with 5 events, 13 events per 1000 PYE) and 1.0% of subjects treated

with  liraglutide  1.8  mg  (2  subjects  with  3  events,  16  events  per  1000  PYE)  and  occurred  only  in 
patients  taking  concomitant  SU  therapy.  Subjects  taking  SUs  were  more  likely  (3–4  times)  to 
experience a minor hypoglycaemic episode in any category compared with subjects not taking SUs. 
The Applicant has proposed a warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding concomitant use with 
SUs, which is agreed. 
Cardiovascular safety 
Cardiovascular safety is an important issue in the assessment of this product. The relevant guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007) states that in view of the goals of treatment of obesity, drugs used 
to  treat  it  should  be  shown  to  have  no  deleterious  effects  on  cardiovascular  risk  factors.  Yet,  the 
consistent finding that GLP-1 analogues increase the pulse rate has caused concern in this respect. 
Mechanism 
The mechanism behind the increase in pulse rate is not elucidated, however the Applicant suggests 
that GLP-1 receptors are present in the cardiac pacemaker and exert a direct effect. It seems unlikely 
that the increase in pulse is the result of adrenergic stimulation based on the clinical pharmacology 
data. 
Pulse observations 
Based on the pool of 5 trials, mean resting pulse increased after treatment initiation in the liraglutide 
3.0  mg  group  and  peaked  after  approximately  6  weeks  (Mean  change  from  baseline:  liraglutide 
4.5 bpm, placebo 1.1 bpm), and gradually declined thereafter. The effect persists until end-of-trial 
and is then 2.8 bpm above placebo. 
Dose response 
According to the Applicant, there is no dose response for the effect on pulse. This is supported by data 
from  trial  1922  in  T2DM  visualised  in  Figure  S2.  The  data  from  Trial  1807  are  somewhat  less 
convincing, but a dose response, if any, must be small.

Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) 
The  Applicant  has  provided  an  extensive  cardiovascular  meta-analysis  to  assess  the  risk  of  MACE 
(cardiovascular  death  or  non-fatal  stroke  or  myocardial  infarction).  The  pre-specified  MACE 
meta-analysis returned a hazard ratio for the weight management pool of 0.40 [95% CI: 0.15; 1.05] 
for  total  liraglutide  vs.  total  comparator  (primary  analysis,  17  events).  The  individual  trials  and  a 
meta-analysis of the diabetes programme with liraglutide 1.8 mg show similar results.  
In the response to the Day120 LoQ, meta-analyses of adjudicated MACEs in the weight management 
pool updated with data from the ongoing 1839-ext until the cut-off date 11 Nov 2013 were provided. 
The analyses gave the following hazard ratios and 95% CIs: 
0.40  [0.16;  1.01]  for  total  liraglutide  versus  total  comparator  (weight  management  pool 
• 
including 1839-ext, primary analysis, total number of events = 19) 
0.33 [0.12; 0.90] for liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (weight management pool including 
• 
1839-ext, sensitivity analysis, total number of events = 16) 
Adverse events in SOC “Cardiac Disorders” 
The rate of events in the SOC “Cardiac disorders” was 4.5 events/100 PYE for liraglutide 3.0 mg, 4.7 
events/100  PYE  for  total  liraglutide  and  4.3  events/100  PYE  for  placebo.  The  ‘MedDRA  search  for 
cardiac arrhythmia’ identified a total of 132 treatment-emergent events reported in 113 subjects with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (3.3%, 4.4 event per 100 PYE) and 64 events in 58 subjects with placebo (3.0%, 
4.0 event per 100 PYE) 
Pancreatitis 
Incretin  based  therapies,  including  liraglutide,  have  been  brought  in  relation  with  events  of 
pancreatitis. The Applicant cites literature showing that obesity itself is associated with an increased 
risk of pancreatitis. A study reported 2-year incidence of pancreatitis for obese individuals opting or 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015

not  opting  for  gastric  bypass  surgery.  The  incidence  in  the  non-operated  controls  was  low,  0.1 
events/100  PYE  for  males  and  0.2  for  females  but  much  higher  after  surgery  (0.6  and  0.4% 
respectively), suggesting an effect of weight loss. T2DM, a common comorbidity of obese individuals, 
independently increases the risk of acute pancreatitis by 50%, compared to controls without T2DM. 
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in individuals with T2DM ranges between 0.05–0.42 events per 
100 PYE. 
In  a  recent  perspective  (N  Engl  J  Med  2014;  370:794-797  February  27,  2014DOI: 
10.1056/NEJMp1314078), regulators from Europe and FDA have stated that both agencies agree that 
assertions  concerning  a  causal  association  between  incretin-based  drugs  and  pancreatitis  or 
pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent 
with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding 
such  a  causal  relationship.  Although  the  totality  of  the  data  that  have  been  reviewed  provides 
reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more 
data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal. In accordance to this, a 
warning has been included in the SmPC (section 4.4) and likewise, pancreatitis has been included in 
the RMP.  
Adjudicated  events  of  acute  pancreatitis  occurred  in  greater  number  with  liraglutide  compared  to 
placebo: 7 (0.2% of subjects; 0.2 events per 100 PYE) with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1 (<0.1% of 
subjects; <0.1 events per 100 PYE) with placebo during the main treatment periods. The numbers 
within  the  weight  management  programme  are  too  small  to  allow  analysis  of  a  possible 
dose-response.  
In the weight management trials, events sent for adjudication were 17 (0.5% of subjects, 0.6 events 
per 100 PYE) for total liraglutide and 3 (0.2% of subjects, 0.2 events per 100 PYE) for comparator. 
Adjudication confirmed 8/20 (40%) of the cases. The 20 pancreatitis events identified in the main 
period  and  sent  for  adjudication  combined  investigator  reported  events  (MESI)  and  database 
searches performed to identify any potential additional pancreatitis cases  not  already reported by 
investigators as MESI, based on (1) AEs of pancreatitis or (2) events of increased lipase/amylase with 
concomitant abdominal pain as an AE within a time window of +/- 30 days).   
A MedDRA search in the safety database from the T2DM indication identified 9 treatment-emergent 
events of pancreatitis in 9 subjects treated with liraglutide (0.1%, 0.2 events per 100 PYE) and 2 
treatment-emergent  events  in  2  subjects  treated  with  comparator  (<0.1%,  <0.1  events  per  100 
PYE). In both treatment groups, the majority (5 of 9 events) were reported as ‘pancreatitis acute’ or 
‘pancreatitis’. In this program, no adjudication was implemented for pancreatitis.  
In the weight management program, some cases were not primarily identified as AE, thus the search 
may have been more sensitive than in the T2DM programme. Comparing non-adjudicated events, the 
rate of pancreatitis may be higher in the weight management programme (0.6 events per 100 PYE) 
than in the T2DM programme (0.2 events per 100 PYE), which could be related to the indication or the 
dose or overly sensitive inclusion of events. This occurred although T2DM is an independent risk factor 
for pancreatitis. 
All  in  all,  comparison  of  the  (adjudicated)  data  from  the  weight  management  programme  to  the 
(unadjudicated) data from the T2DM programme is not reliable.  
All but two of the confirmed events were reported as SAEs by the investigator, and subjects with 
treatment-emergent  events  were  withdrawn  from  any  on-going  liraglutide  treatment.  Two  of  the 
cases would likely have been classified as moderately severe (defined by the presence of transient 
organ failure or local or systemic complications in the absence of persistent organ failure) according 
to the revised Atlanta criteria. For the majority of cases, the duration was short (2-15 days). Gall 
stones were reported in only one of these cases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 67/91 
 
 
 
With  liraglutide  at  doses  up  to  3.0  mg,  lipase  elevations  and  fluctuations  were  common  and 
unaccompanied by pancreatitis in 99.8% of cases (values ≥2×UNR in subjects with T2DM), indicating 
a low predictive value of pancreatic enzyme activity elevation in this context. Two subjects had lost 
>20%  of  their  original  weight.  No  other  factors  were  identified  as  risk  factors  for  pancreatitis; 
occurrence seems not related to duration of use.  
Mean amylase and lipase values were higher with liraglutide 3.0 vs placebo (e.g. LOCF at end of trial: 
[amylase]  61.1  vs  57.4  U/L,  baseline  corrected  difference  4.5  [lipase]  48.4  vs  36.7  U/L,  baseline 
corrected difference 12.1). There was no clear trend during treatment.  
During the 1-year treatment period, more subjects on liraglutide 3.0 mg than on placebo experienced 
amylase activity ≥UNR (4.5% vs. 2.3%), the majority of which were <2 ×UNR. Few subjects (0.3% 
with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 0.2% with placebo) experienced amylase levels of ≥2×UNR, and just 2 
subjects on liraglutide 3.0 mg and 1 on placebo had amylase ≥3×UNR, at any time during treatment. 
Hence, the mean increase in amylase with liraglutide during trials was attributable to small increases 
within the normal range in many subjects, rather than to large increases in a few subjects. 
During the 1-year treatment period, more subjects on liraglutide 3.0 mg than subjects on placebo 
experienced lipase activity ≥UNR (21-27% vs. 6-7%), the majority of which were <2×UNR. Lipase 
levels of ≥2×UNR occurred in 5.7% of subjects with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2.6% with placebo; lipase 
levels  of  ≥3×UNR  occurred  in  2.1%  with  liraglutide  3.0  mg  and  1.0%  with  placebo),  at  any  time 
during treatment. 
Acute gallstone disease 
There  were  no  prior  safety  concerns  with  respect  to  gallbladder  events  based  on  clinical  trial  or 
post-marketing  pharmacovigilance  data  with  liraglutide  for  T2DM  (Victoza).  An  increased  risk  of 
gallstone  formation,  induced  by  weight  loss,  has  been  proposed  as  a  potential  mediator  of  the 
observed greater frequency of acute pancreatitis cases seen with GLP-1 based therapies. A recent 
publication  showing  reduced  gallbladder  emptying  following  acute  administration  of  exenatide  (a 
GLP-1 analogue) provides an alternative potential mechanism. 
In the weight management pool, the proportion of subjects reporting acute gallstone disease events 
was higher with liraglutide 3.0 mg (2.3%) than with placebo (0.9%) The imbalance was mainly driven 
by  events  of  cholelithiasis  and  cholecystitis  (‘cholelithiasis’:  1.5%  vs.  0.5%;  ‘cholecystitis  acute’: 
0.4% vs. <0.1%; ‘cholecystitis’: 0.2% vs. <0.1%, respectively, for liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo). 
The risk of acute gall stone disease is related to the weight loss that was achieved. Nevertheless, an 
increased  incidence  of  gallbladder-related  events  was  consistently  observed  across  weight-loss 
categories, indicating that other factors than weight loss may be involved.

EMA/143005/2015 
Page 68/91 
 
 
 
Figure S3 Event rate of Acute gallstone disease by weight categories  
AEs of “Acute gallstone disease” as identified by a MedDRA search in the weight management pool 
were 79 (2.3% or 3.1 events/100 PYE) vs 17 (0.9% or 1.2 events/100 PYE) for liraglutide 3.0 mg vs 
placebo respectively. In supplementary pool II - excluding NN8022 trials, describing mainly diabetes 
trials at the liraglutide dose of 1.8 mg, the corresponding numbers were 55 (0,8% or 1,3 events / 100 
PYE) and 28 (0,8% or 1,3 events / 100 PYE). Accordingly, in the T2DM, the dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide 
does  not  signal  gall  stone  events.  The  higher  frequency  in  the  weight  management  pool  could  be 
attributed to dose or indication. In dose-finding trial 1807, Figure S4 is suggestive of a dose response, 
but  in  T2DM  trial  1922,  the  (low)  numbers  of  events  were  not.  Gallbladder  events  have  been 
adequately addressed in the SmPC.

Neoplasms 
The proportion of subjects in the weight management trials with neoplasms confirmed by the external 
EAC and the corresponding event rates were in general similar with liraglutide 3.0 mg (1.9%, 2.3 
events per 100 PYE) and placebo (1.5%, 2.2 events per 100 PYE), as were the distribution (benign, 
malignant or pre-malignant) and type (tissue or organ of origin) of neoplasm. The overall incidence 
rate of confirmed malignant neoplasms was low, and all cases of malignant neoplasms with liraglutide 
occurred at the 3.0 mg dose, consistent with its relative contribution to overall exposure.  
Breast 
Breast  cancer  and  breast  carcinoma  in  situ  occurred  more  frequently  in  females  treated  with 
liraglutide  3.0  mg  as  compared  with  placebo  in  the  weight  management  trials.  Based  on 
treatment-emergent external EAC-confirmed events in the main treatment period, the proportion of 
females with events and the corresponding rates were: for breast cancer: 0.29% (0.4 events per 100 
PYE) vs. 0.08% (0.1 per 100 PYE), breast cancer in situ: 0.13% (0.1 events per 100 PYE) vs. 0.08% 
(0.1  events  per  100  PYE)  for  liraglutide  3.0  mg  and  placebo,  respectively.  Breast  cancer  was  too 
infrequent to make any firm conclusions regarding a potential effect of liraglutide treatment. Human 
breast  carcinomas  do  not  express  the  GLP-1  receptor,  which  is  detected  at  very  low  amounts  in 
non-neoplastic human breast ducts and lobuli. The Applicant attributes these findings to chance. At 
present  this  can  be  neither  confirmed  nor  rejected.  Breast  cancer  is  included  in  the  RMP  as  an 
important potential risk. 
Pancreas 
In the weight management trials, there were no reports of exocrine pancreas cancer. A single subject 
was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) during treatment with liraglutide 3.0 
mg, but this subject had been under investigation for the disorder prior to trial enrolment. 
Thyroid 
Medullary  thyroid  carcinoma  (MTC),  an  extremely  rare  form  of  cancer  in  humans,  was  a  focus  of 
discussion in the original regulatory review of liraglutide for the treatment of T2DM and a number of 
post-approval 
commitments  have  been 
completed 
(non-clinical)  or  are  underway 
(pharmacoepidemiology  and  case  series  registry).  Based  on  all  available  clinical  data,  there  is  no 
evidence that the rodent findings translate into increased risk in humans.  
The overall incidence of thyroid cancers in the weight management trials was low, with no apparent 
differences between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo; all but one thyroid cancers were of non C-cell 
origin. One MTC event occurred in a placebo subject shortly after randomisation. This is the second 
event of MTC diagnosed in clinical development programmes with liraglutide; none of the events were 
in subjects exposed to liraglutide  
Calcitonin is a specific biological marker of MTC and all elevated levels (≥20 ng/L) were subject to 
on-going  blinded  review  by  an  independent  external  group  of  thyroid  experts.  Patients  with  MTC 
usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. The clinical significance of fluctuations below this level in 
patients without MTC is unknown. Consistent with findings in all completed trials with liraglutide for 
T2DM to date, there was no indication of a liraglutide effect on blood calcitonin concentration with 
either 1.8 mg (T2DM) or 3.0 mg (weight management).

Colon 
Colorectal carcinomas do not express the GLP-1 receptor and in the normal colon, only myenteric 
plexus cells express the receptor. Malignant colorectal neoplasms occurred at very low rate in weight 
management trials, with no imbalances between liraglutide and placebo More subjects treated with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (11 with 11 events, 0.3%, 0.4 events per 100 PYE) than with placebo (4 subjects 
with 4 events, 0.2%, 0.3 events per 100 PYE) reported benign colorectal neoplasms, mainly colon 
adenomas in males aged above 50 years with a relevant medical history. The majority of the events 
were diagnosed during routine screening colonoscopy. Based on a lack of biological plausibility and no 
imbalances  in  completed  trials  with  liraglutide  in  T2DM,  the  Applicant  attributes  the  imbalance  to 
chance. At present this can be neither confirmed nor rejected. Neoplasm is included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. 
Skin 
Skin fibrosarcoma is of interest because of preclinical findings. No cases of skin fibrosarcoma were 
observed in the weight management trials. The proportion of subjects diagnosed with skin cancers 
appeared to be lower with liraglutide than with placebo (0.2%, 0.2 events per 100 PYE vs. 0.3%, 0.4 
events per 100 PYE, respectively). 
Renal failure 
Events related to renal failure are discussed in Section 4.4 of the SmPC of Victoza under the subject 
dehydration; a similar statement is proposed for Saxenda. It is likely that investigators were aware of 
this issue during their participation in the trial, either based on their experience with Victoza or on 
specific information from the trial. Based on similar adverse event rates and similar rates of subjects 
with abnormal clinical chemistry values (e.g. creatinin values above  normal range, Table S2), the 
precautionary strategy is considered adequate.

Medication errors related to the device 
The trials were done with the Novo Nordisk FlexPen, which is also in use  for insulin products. For 
Saxenda a different device is proposed. The Saxenda pen is similar to the FlexTouch pen, which is 
approved for insulin products. Thus, the information related to the device from the trials does not 
apply  to  the  proposed  product.  However,  the  performance  of  the  Saxenda  pen  is  expected  to  be 
similar to the FlexTouch pen.

Thyroid disease  
Thyroid disease raises no concern in this development program.  
Psychiatric disorders 
Current data do not suggest that Saxenda causes depression or stimulates suicidal behaviour. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the weight management pool, the proportion and rate of subjects reporting SAEs was higher in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group (6.3%, 9.3 events per 100 PYE) than in the placebo group (4.6%, 7.1 events 
per 100 PYE). This is partly explained by a difference in acute gallstone events (Figure S5).  
Figure S5 Most frequent SAEs (≥0.2%) − treatment-emergent − weight management pool 
%: Percentage of subjects experiencing at least one event, R: event rate per 100 patient years of exposure. 
For SAEs, the comparisons in the dose-finding trial 1807 and T2DM trial 1922 are underpowered to 
assess the rates of rare events such as pancreatitis, cardiovascular events and neoplasms. 
Mortality was rare in the clinical development programme (liraglutide n=3, placebo: n=3, with many 
more patients exposed to liraglutide) and no new concerns are identified by analysis of deaths. 
Laboratory findings 
Based on laboratory findings, physical examination and ECG, no safety concerns were identified.

Safety in special populations 
Older patients 
Exposure in older patients above 75 years is extremely limited. Only 17 patients aged ≥75 years were 
included in the SCALE program, of whom 7 (41%) discontinued treatment due to AEs (See Table S3). 
Consequentially this resulted in a “non recommendation” (Section 4.4) pending more reassuring data. 
The Applicant’s proposal to address this in Section 4.2 of the SmPC is acceptable:  
No dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥75 years of age is 
limited and use in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Renal impairment 
Renal impairment seems to have no special impact on AEs due to liraglutide, although more AEs are 
seen in both liraglutide and placebo groups. However, exposure of severely renally impaired patients 
is extremely limited to only 3 patients on active treatment, resulting in not recommending the use of 
the product in that population in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Hepatic impairment 
The Applicant only provided data with respect to baseline AST and ALT values and AEs. No specific 
analysis  is  provided  with  regard  to  baseline  Child-Pugh  class,  although  impaired  hepatic  function 
apparently was no specific exclusion criterion, resulting in not recommending the use of the product 
in severe hepatic impairment in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4.  
Pregnancy 
The  data  in  unintended  pregnancies  during  the  clinical  development  of  Saxenda  are  limitted  but 
reassuring. Still, given the teratogenic potential of the product in preclinical investigations, liraglutide

should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy.  Also  weight  reduction,  either  by  non-pharmacological  or 
pharmacological means, is usually not recommended during pregnancy.  
This is refelcted accordingly in section 4.6 of the SmPC and is in line with a similar text of the SmPC 
of Victoza, which is supported. 
Immunological events 
Liraglutide is a protein-based drug and accordingly, immunological events were more frequent with 
liraglutide than with placebo.  
Although allergic reactions were similar between liraglutide and placebo, cases of anaphylaxis were 
only  reported  with  liraglutide.  Both  in  the  proposed  SmPC  of  Saxenda  and  the  SmPC  of  Victoza  , 
anaphylactic reactions are categorised as ‘rare’, which is supported. 
Injection site reactions  
The  placebo  treatment  used  the  same  device  as  active  treatment  and  the  placebo  formulation 
contained the same excipients as active treatment. 
Injection  site  reactions  were  frequently  reported  in  the  weight  management  pool,  more  so  with 
liraglutide  3.0  mg  (13.9%,  22.9  events  per  100  PYE)  than  with  placebo  (10.5%,  15.7  events  per 
100 PYE). This incidence rate was higher than that observed in completed trials with liraglutide for 
T2DM  (2.9%,  5.6  events  per  100  PYE  vs.  1.5%,  2.7  events  per  100  PYE,  for  liraglutide  and 
comparator). 
The incidences of injection site reactions reported in the weight management pool were higher than 
those reported with liraglutide 1.8 mg in subjects with T2DM in trial 1922. Indeed, in trial 1922 the 
rate of injection site reactions with lira 3.0 mg was about twice the rate with lira 1.8 mg; although the 
rates for lira 1.8 mg and placebo were similar. Both rates were higher than in the Victoza program.

Data from trial 1922 (Table S5) suggest that also for liraglutide antibodies a dose response is possible. 
It is agreed that the rates were low and antibody formation seems to have no clinically relevant 
impact.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data with respect to safety of interactions, beyond what has been provided from the Victoza 
development program, was presented ; the Applicant’s approach to interactions is therefore based on 
the assumption of equivalence with Victoza. According to trial 3630, gastric emptying after 5 hours is 
equivalent between liraglutide doses of 1.8 and 3.0 mg. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the potential 
for  interactions  is  significantly  different  between  obesity  and  T2DM.  Therefore,  the  Applicant’s 
reasoning was accepted by CHMP. 
Accordingly, the  paragraphs on interaction in the SmPCs of Saxenda and Victoza are similar. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
There are no safety concerns related to discontinuation of liraglutide 3.0 mg.  
2.6.1.   Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions (i.e. attributable to liraglutide) reported in clinical 
trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The safety database includes 5813 patients. Of these, 2341 were on the target dose for at least 1 
year. This exposure is sufficient based on guidance in ICH-E1.  
Adverse events 
The general AE profile is in line with the experience with Victoza. The most commonly reported AEs 
with liraglutide 3.0 mg were gastrointestinal disorders. Most patients experience nausea already in 
the first weeks of treatment, during dose titration. Other patients express decreased appetite, which 
is in line with the pharmacology of liraglutide. Also asthenic conditions like fatigue occur early and in 
increased incidence with liraglutide.  
In  subjects  without  T2DM,  no  severe  hypoglycaemic  events  were  reported.  The  proportion  of 
subjects reporting AEs of hypoglycaemia outside the fasting FPG and OGTT visits was low, both with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (1.6% of subjects) and placebo (1.1% of subjects). Many hypoglycaemic episodes 
occurred  after  OGTT  in  these  patients  and  were  recognised  by  glucose  measurement  rather  than 
symptoms. The circumstances of an OGTT can be considered non-physiologic and therefore, these 
events are less important.  
In  subjects  with  T2DM,  severe  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  by  0.7%  of  subjects  treated  with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (3 subjects with 5 events, 13 events per 1000 PYE) and 1.0% of subjects treated 
with  liraglutide  1.8  mg  (2  subjects  with  3  events,  16  events  per  1000  PYE)  and  occurred  only  in

patients taking concomitant SU therapy. The Applicant has proposed a warning in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC regarding concomitant use with SUs, which is agreed. 
The consistent finding that GLP-1 analogues increase the pulse rate has caused concern with respect 
to cardiovascular safety. There are data that GLP-1 receptors are present in the cardiac pacemaker 
suggesting a direct effect of liraglutide on the heart. The maximum increase in pulse rate is 4.5 bpm 
for liraglutide (compared to placebo 1.1 bpm, treatment effect 3.4 bpm) after 6 weeks and slightly 
declined thereafter. The effect persists until end-of-trial and is then 2.8 bpm above placebo. There is 
no indication of a dose response.  
The period of maximum effect on pulse rate is well covered by the safety database; however less 
information is available with respect to (very) long term effects of the increase in pulse. Because the 
effect on pulse is not strongly related to dose and seems to be a class effect, information from the 
large cardiovascular safety trials with liragutide (LEADER) and other GLP-1 analogues is relevant. This 
LEADER trial (investigating liraglutide 1.8 mg) is on-going and no data are available, although it is 
somewhat reassuring that the safety monitoring board recommended trial continuation. Long-term 
extensions  of  trials  in  this  application  will  also  provide  2-years  data  by  2015.  Currently  some 
uncertainty remains around this issue. 
The data from the MACE analysis strongly suggest that liraglutide 3.0 mg has no deleterious effect on 
CV safety as required by the guideline. 
In  the  weight  management  pool,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  acute  gallstone  disease 
events was higher with liraglutide 3.0 mg (2.3%) than with placebo (0.9%) The imbalance was mainly 
driven  by  events  of  cholelithiasis  and  cholecystitis  (‘cholelithiasis’:  1.5%  vs.  0.5%;  ‘cholecystitis 
acute’:  0.4%  vs.  <0.1%;  ‘cholecystitis’:  0.2%  vs.  <0.1%,  respectively,  for  liraglutide  3.0  mg  vs. 
placebo). 
The risk of acute gall stone disease is related to the weight loss that was achieved. Even within these 
categories,  weight  loss  for  liraglutide  may  have  been  more  than  for  placebo.  Nevertheless,  an 
increased  incidence  of  gallbladder-related  events  was  consistently  observed  across  weight-loss 
categories, indicating that other factors than weight loss may be involved. The higher frequency in the 
weight management pool could be attributed to dose or indication.  
Uncertainty  of  a  possible  link  of  the  use  of  GLP-1  analogues  with  acute  pancreatitis  still  exists. 
Adjudicated  events  of  acute  pancreatitis  occurred  in  greater  number  with  liraglutide  compared  to 
placebo: 7 (0.2% of subjects; 0.2 events per 100 PYE) with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1 (<0.1% of 
subjects; <0.1 events per 100 PYE) with placebo during the main treatment periods. The numbers 
within  the  weight  management  programme  are  too  small  to  allow  analysis  of  a  possible 
dose-response.  
Comparing non-adjudicated events, the rate of pancreatitis may be higher in the weight management 
programme (0.6 events per 100 PYE) than in T2DM (0.2 events per 100 PYE), which could be related 
to the indication or the dose. 
It is conceivable that the events of acute pancreatitis and acute gallstone disease are related, but the 
low number of pancreatitis events precludes further analysis at present. 
There is no evidence of an increased number of malignancies in the weight management program. 
However,  the  numbers  of  events  were  too  low  for  sound  statistical  analysis  and  some  types  of 
neoplasms  show  a  numerical  disadvantage  for  liraglutide  3.0  mg  (breast,  colon).  The  Applicant 
commits to detailed follow-up of relevant cases.  
Injection  site  reactions were frequently reported in the weight management pool, more so with 
liraglutide  3.0  mg  (13.9%,  22.9  events  per  100  PYE)  than  with  placebo  (10.5%,  15.7  events  per 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 76/91 
 
 
 
100 PYE). This incidence rate was higher than that observed in completed trials with liraglutide for 
T2DM  (2.9%,  5.6  events  per  100  PYE  vs.  1.5%,  2.7  events  per  100  PYE,  for  liraglutide  and 
comparator). 
Renal  failure  is addressed in the SmPC of Victoza as a risk, which is likely related to dehydration 
caused by GI adverse events. In the weight management program, rates were similar for liraglutide 
and placebo, suggesting this risk is adequately managed by creating awareness. 
Medication  errors  related  to  the  device  cannot  be  adequately  addressed  as  the  proposed 
commercial  device  is  different  from  the  device  used  in  the  trials.  This  issue  is  discussed  in  the 
Pharmacovigilance section.  
Thyroid  disease  and  psychiatric  disorders  caused  no  concern  in  the  weight  management 
program. 
Relation of AEs to dose 
Overall, the higher liraglutide dose in comparison to Victoza seems to have little effect on the AE rate, 
except  for  gastrointestinal  events  which  are  more  frequent.  However,  the  comparisons  in  the 
dose-finding trial 1807 and T2DM trial 1922 are underpowered to assess the rates of rare events such 
as pancreatitis, cardiovascular events and neoplasms.  
Safety beyond 1 year of treatment 
In  the  extension  of  dose-finding  trial  1807,  AE  rates  for  subjects  using  liraglutide  for  weight 
management were compared to event rates with orlistat. As the AE profile of both liraglutide and 
orlistat  is  mostly  gastrointestinal,  it  is  not  surprising  that  event  rates  were  generally  comparable 
between treatments.  
With the day 120 and 180 responses, additional interim data from the extension of trial 1839 have 
been added, which confirm the safety profile established during the main trials. In total, in trial 1839 
and its double blind, placebo controlled extension up to 1-Oct-2014, 903 subjects were exposed to 
liraglutide 3.0 mg for ≥2 years and 694 patients were exposed for 3 years. Important event rates of 
MACE, gall bladder events and pancreatitis did not increase over time; however the number of events 
was too low for more robust conclusions. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment seems to have no special impact on AEs due to liraglutide, although more AEs are 
seen in both liraglutide and placebo groups. However, exposure of severely renally impaired patients 
is  extremely  limited  to  only  3  patients  on  active  treatment.  Saxenda  is  proposed  to  be  “not 
recommended” in these patients. 
Data on subjects with hepatic impairment are limited, the Applicant only provided data with respect 
to  baseline  AST  and  ALT  values  and  AEs.  No  specific  analysis  is  provided  with  regard  to  baseline 
Child-Pugh class, and such data were not captured in the phase 3 program. Impaired hepatic function 
apparently was no specific exclusion criterion. Based on PK-data, exposure is lower in subjects with 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. Therefore, treatment is expected 
to be safe. Efficacy may be reduced, but the stopping rule will protect subjects from long-term use of 
a non-effective therapy. In subjects with mild/moderate hepatic impairment, cautions should be used 
because of the very limited therapeutic experience and the potentially more severe impact of gall 
bladder events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 77/91 
 
 
 
The Applicant suggests that the lower liraglutide exposure observed in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment  is  likely  because  liraglutide  is  highly  bound  to  plasma  albumin  and  clearance  partly 
determined  by  albumin  binding.  This  might  be  a  part  of  the  explanation.  In  patients  with  severe 
hepatic  impairment,  the  exposure  is  decreased  with  44%  and  the  benefit  of  treatment  to  this 
population  is  seriously  questioned.  Therefore  treatment  of  this  special  patient  population  is  not 
recommended, which is adequately addressed in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The  data  in  unintended  pregnancies  during  the  clinical  development  of  Saxenda  are  limited  but 
reassuring. Still, given the teratogenic potential of the product in preclinical investigations, liraglutide 
should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy.  Also  weight  reduction,  either  by  non-pharmacological  or 
pharmacological means, is usually not recommended during pregnancy. This is adequately addressed 
in the SmPC. 
Interactions 
No  new  data  with  respect  to  safety  of  interactions  are  discussed;  the  Applicant’s  approach  to 
interactions  is  based  on  equivalence  with  Victoza.  According  to  trial  3630,  gastric  emptying  after 
5 hours is equivalent between liraglutide doses of 1.8 and 3.0 mg. It is unlikely that the potential for 
interactions is significantly different between obesity and T2DM. Therefore, the Applicant’s reasoning 
is accepted. Accordingly, the (proposed) interaction paragraphs in the SmPCs of Saxenda and Victoza 
are similar. 
Comparison with the clinical trial program of Victoza 
The mean age in the pooled trials for the weight management programme was 46.9 years (range 
18-82)  In the clinical trial program for Victoza , mean age was approximately 55 years, ranging from 
19–80 years. Mean body weight was 105.7 kg, while in the Victoza trials it ranged from approximately 
80–100 
kg. 
(http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hu
man/001026/WC500050016.pdf).  
The rates of cardiac disorders (SOC) were 4.5, 4.7 and 4.3 events / 100 PYE for liraglutide 3.0, total 
and placebo respectively. This can be compared to the initial MAA for Victoza where the rates were 
liraglutide  0.6  mg:  8.3,  liraglutide  1.2  mg:  7.3,  liraglutide  1.8  mg:  5.7,  placebo:  6.8  and  active 
comparator: 4.9 events per 100 SYE. 
In conclusion, the population for Saxenda was younger and weightier but had a lower rate of cardiac 
events. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  general  AE  profile  is  in  line  with  the  experience  with  Victoza.  However,  current  data  are 
insufficient  to  assess  if  uncommon  events  (pancreatitis,  neoplasms)  occur  more  frequently  with 
Saxenda’s higher dose (3.0 mg) compared to the dose in T2DM (1.8 mg). It seems that the increase 
in pulse rate is not dose dependant. Gall bladder events occur more frequently with 3.0 mg compared 
to 1.8 mg.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Saxenda  (liraglutide  3.0  mg  once  daily,  SC)  is  proposed  for  chronic  weight  management  in  adult 
obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) or overweight patients (27≤ BMI <30 kg/m²) with weight related 
comorbidity. The active substance is already authorised as Victoza for use in Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) 
with a lower dose (1.8 mg). Liraglutide regulates appetite by increasing feelings of satiety, leading to 
a lower caloric intake of approximately 140 kcal/meal as assessed in PD trial 3630. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  clinical  development  programme  for  liraglutide  in  weight  management  includes  one  phase  2 
dose-finding trial (trial 1807) and four confirmatory phase 3 trials (trials 1839, 1922, 3970 and 1923), 
which  were  conducted  worldwide  and  involved  5813  subjects  in  the  originally  proposed  target 
population (BMI ≥30 kg/m² or BMI ≥27 kg/m² with weight related comorbidity).  
In the dose range that was investigated, the highest dose investigated (3.0 mg) was also the most 
effective. This dose was chosen for further evaluation in the phase 3 programme and was proposed 
for authorisation. 
The Applicant executed 5 separate trials which together provide an adequate overview of the benefits 
(and risks) that can be expected from treatment with Saxenda. The clinical programme (including the 
focus on 1-year efficacy data) is consistent with the “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products used in weight control” (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev.1 - 2007). In all trials, liraglutide or placebo 
was  given  on  top  of  counselling  to  improve  diet  and  exercise  throughout  the  trial.  All  5  trials 
investigated  the  proposed  dose  in  (subsets  of)  the  target  population  and  evaluated  the  effect  on

weight, usually after 56 weeks, thus allowing pooling of the main results. The population in the trials 
together is representative of the target population.  
The  primary  analysis  estimated  the  weight  loss  and  the  proportion  of  responders  defined  as 
subjects  achieving  a  5-  or  10%  weight  loss.  A  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  applied.  In  the 
pooled dataset, treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg resulted in weight loss of 7.5% (7.8 kg) vs. 2.3% 
(2.5 kg) with placebo, a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 5.2% [95% CI: 4.83; 5.53]. The results 
were highly statistically significant. The data were robust across a range of sensitivity analyses. The 
placebo-subtracted treatment effect in the most favourable scenario (the Completers analysis), was 
5.6% and in the least favourable scenario (BOCF, but subjects with weight gain imputed with LOCF) 
4.5%. 
The responders achieving > 10% weight loss were 30.5% for liraglutide 3.0 mg v 8.4% for placebo in 
the pooled 56-week trials. Also these results were highly statistically significant and supported by 
sensitivity analyses. The (favourable) estimates looking at completers only were 38.2% and 12.7% 
respectively;  the  (unfavourable)  estimates  counting  early  withdrawals  as  non-responders  were 
28.6% and 8.52% respectively. 
In general, the results were consistent over the various trials and relevant subgroups with statistically 
significant results, e.g. normoglycaemic (n=1780, -5.26%) and pre-diabetic (n=2844, -5.41%) study 
participants. During the assessment, a more restricted target population was discussed by CHMP, i.e. 
adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and at least one weight related comorbidity. However, when comparing 
subgroups  based  on  baseline  BMI,  although  the  absolute  weight  loss  was  higher  in  the  high  BMI 
subgroups, the efficacy as % weight change was less than in the lowest BMI subgroup. The treatment 
estimate  for  females  (n=3759;  -5.83%)  was  better  compared  to  males  (n=1488;  -3.56%). 
Treatment  effect  in  T2DM  as  assessed  in  trial  1922  (-3.95%)  was  less  than  in  all  1  year  trials 
(-5.24%). This is partly explained by the high participation of males in this trial, as the results for 
males  (-2.93%)  was  worse  than  for  females  (-4.84%).  After  correction  for  gender  effects,  the 
interaction is no longer statistically significant and is not considered to pose any clinical problems.  
During assessment, a stopping rule was proposed and accepted for the SmPC section 4.1, stating that 
treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose (16 weeks 
including the titration phase) if patients have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. For 
subjects who pass the stopping rule (N=1637, 65.0%), the expected weight change is -11.2% after 
one year. A response of at least 10% is achieved by 51.2%. Also, effects on risk factors are at least 
as good as in the overall population.  
The  secondary  endpoints  were  (related  to)  body  composition  and  weight  (e.g.  waist 
circumference), glycaemic control (e.g. HbA1c), cardiometabolic risk, concomitant medications and 
patient  reported  outcomes.  This  is  consistent  with  the  guideline.  Sleep  apnoea  was  the  primary 
endpoint in trial 3970. To control the Type I error caused by the multitude of endpoints, a hierarchical 
testing procedure was defined for the pooled analyses of the secondary endpoints. The results from 
this analysis can be used in a confirmatory way. Statistically significant effects were observed on waist 
circumference (-3.98 cm), HbA1C (-0.93% in T2DM patients), SBP (-2.9 mmHg), DBP (-0.8 mmHg), 
and LDL (2.7%). The effects on SBP and HbA1c are largely independent from the effect on weight. 
There were beneficial treatment effects in the patient reported outcomes for the following domains: 
SF-36 physical function score: 1.40 (0.91; 1.89), SF-36 general health score: 1.77 (1.27; 2.27) and 
IWQoL-Lite physical function: 4.81 (3.83; 5.79). 
The pharmacokinetic properties of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obese or overweight subjects were overall 
similar to those for liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg in healthy subjects and subjects with T2DM. 
Liraglutide  3.0  mg  generally  resulted  in  higher  exposure  than  liraglutide  1.8  mg  in  obese  and 
overweight subjects and the exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015 
Page 84/91 
 
 
 
Subjects with obesity that is secondary to endocrinologic disorders (e.g. Cushing’s Syndrome) or 
to treatment with drugs that may cause weight gain (e.g. insulin, psychotropic drugs) or eating 
disorders were not included in the trials and use of liraglutide in these patients are not recommended 
in the SmPC. 
The  Applicant  recognised  several  factors  that  influenced  the  exposure  to  liraglutide  for  instance 
gender and weight, and also (but to a lesser extent) T2DM and the injection site, albeit that these two 
are considered not clinically relevant when evaluated separately. Between extreme scenarios, an up 
to 5 fold exposure difference can occur. Especially in high-weight males, exposure may be too low for 
therapeutic efficacy. The Applicant argues, that therapy will be discontinued by the stopping rule in 
these cases, which is agreed.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the pooled dataset, the rate of withdrawals is high, 29.6%. This number is consistent across all 
trials.  This  withdrawal  rate  is  not  unexpected  for  placebo-controlled  trials  of  one-year  duration  in 
obesity.  Only  26.8%  of  subjects  who  withdrew  came  in  for  the  visit  at  the  nominal  end-of-trial, 
causing missing endpoint data for 21.7% of subjects.  
The  interpretation  of  the sleep-apnoea  related  parameters  is  difficult,  as  there  is  no  established 
margin for clinical relevance. The mean apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was the primary endpoint in 
trial 3970. AHI at baseline (49.2 events/hour) reflected a severely diseased study population and 
decreased after 32 weeks with both liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo, but the improvement was greater 
with liraglutide (-12.2 vs. -6.1 episodes/hour, p=0.015). The decrease in AHI was closely correlated 
to  weight  loss,  as  was  known  from  literature.  The  decrease  in  ‘episodes’  was  accompanied  by 
statistically non-significant (but beneficial) changes in the sleep-related patient-reported outcomes.  
It is not clear if and how long the benefits will persist after treatment discontinuation; in fact, it is 
likely that weight would return to baseline. In trial 1839, subjects treated with liraglutide who had 
completed 1 year of treatment were re-randomised to 3-months treatment with liraglutide or placebo. 
Subjects who switched from liraglutide to placebo gained a mean 2.91% (2.63 kg) of body weight 
compared to 0.69% (0.61 kg) in those who continued on liraglutide (treatment difference: -2.18% 
[-2.60;  -1.75],  p<0.0001).  However,  weight  change  in  subjects  who  switched  from  liraglutide  to 
placebo (-6.77% [-6.73 kg]) still remained greater than patients initially randomised to placebo (plus 
diet and exercise) (-3.11% [-3.29 kg]). 
No  estimate  is  shown  about  the  results  in  the  whole  target  population  before  application  of  the 
stopping rule; such an analysis is complicated by the fact that the stopping rule was not applied in the 
trials and treatment of all subjects was continued. Thus the results in this population are presented for 
subjects complying to the stopping rule. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database includes 5813 patients. Of these, 2341 were on active treatment with the target 
dose for at least 1 year. The extent of exposure is adequate based on guidance in ICH-E1.  
The general AE profile is in line with the experience with Victoza. The most commonly reported AEs 
with liraglutide 3.0 mg were gastrointestinal disorders like nausea (liraglutide: 65.4 v placebo 20.9 
events/100 PYE), diarrhoea (34.7 v 14.9), constipation (26.3 v 11.5), vomiting (26.4 v 5.6). Most 
patients experience such events already in the first weeks of treatment, during dose titration. Other 
patients express decreased appetite (12.0 v 2.9), which is in line with the pharmacology of liraglutide. 
Also asthenic conditions like fatigue (9.6 v 6.1) occur more frequently with liraglutide 
Assessment report

In  subjects  without  T2DM,  no  severe  hypoglycaemic  events  were  reported.  The  proportion  of 
subjects  reporting  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  outside  the  FPG  and  OGTT  visits  was  low,  both  with 
liraglutide 3.0 mg (1.6% of subjects) and placebo (1.1% of subjects). In subjects with T2DM, severe 
hypoglycaemia was reported by 0.7% of subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg (3 subjects with 5 
events, 13 events per 1000 PYE) and 1.0% of subjects treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg (2 subjects with 
3 events, 16 events per 1000 PYE) and occurred only in patients taking concomitant SU therapy.  
The consistent finding that GLP-1 analogues increase the pulse rate has caused concern with respect 
to  cardiovascular  safety.  There  are  data,  that  GLP-1  receptors  are  present  in  the  cardiac 
pacemaker suggesting a direct effect of liraglutide on the heart. In the large trials from the weight 
management programme, the maximum increase in pulse rate was 4.5 bpm for liraglutide (compared 
to placebo 1.1 bpm, treatment effect 3.4 bpm) after 6 weeks and slightly declined thereafter. The 
effect persists until end-of-trial and is then 2.5 bpm above placebo. There is no indication of a dose 
response. In the PD trials, the difference in pulse rate was 6-9 bpm during the night. In response to 
FDA regulations, the Applicant has provided an extensive cardiovascular meta-analysis to assess the 
risk  of  MACE  (CV  death  or  non-fatal  stroke  or  myocardial  infarction).  The  pre-specified  MACE 
meta-analysis returned a hazard ratio for the weight management pool of 0.40 [95% CI: 0.15; 1.05] 
for total liraglutide vs. total comparator (primary analysis, 8 v 9 events).  
In  the  weight  management  pool,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  acute  gallstone  disease 
events was higher with liraglutide 3.0 mg (2.3%) than with placebo (0.9%) The imbalance was mainly 
driven  by  events  of  cholelithiasis  and  cholecystitis  (‘cholelithiasis’:  1.5%  vs.  0.5%;  ‘cholecystitis 
acute’:  0.4%  vs.  <0.1%;  ‘cholecystitis’:  0.2%  vs.  0.1%  ,  respectively,  for  liraglutide  3.0  mg  vs. 
placebo).  
Uncertainty  of  a  possible  link  of  the  use  of  GLP-1  analogues  and  acute  pancreatitis  still  exists. 
Adjudicated  events  of  acute  pancreatitis  occurred  in  greater  number  with  liraglutide  compared  to 
placebo:  7  (0.2%  of  subjects;  0.2  events  per  100  PYE)  with  liraglutide  3.0  mg  vs.  1  (<0.1%  of 
subjects; <0.1 events per 100 PYE) with placebo during the main treatment periods. Events of acute 
pancreatitis  were  usually  reason  for  hospitalisation,  although  most  subjects  recovered  within  2 
weeks. Non-adjudicated pancreatitis events were more frequent in this MAA dossier (0.6 events per 
100 PYE) than in the T2DM MAA dossier (0.2 events per 100 PYE). In the T2DM trials, no adjudication 
was  implemented;  also,  the  methods  of  data-collection  in  this  weight  management  dossier  were 
different (more sensitive).  
Injection  site  reactions were frequently reported in the weight management pool, more so with 
liraglutide  3.0  mg  (13.9%,  22.9  events  per  100  PYE)  than  with  placebo  (10.5%,  15.7  events  per 
100 PYE). This incidence rate was higher than that observed in completed trials with liraglutide for 
T2DM  (2.9%,  5.6  events  per  100  PYE  vs.  1.5%,  2.7  events  per  100  PYE,  for  liraglutide  and 
comparator). 
Renal  failure  is addressed in the SmPC of Victoza as a risk, which is likely related to dehydration 
caused  by  gastro  intestinal  adverse  events.  In  the  weight  management  programme,  rates  were 
similar for liraglutide and placebo. 
Thyroid  disease  and  psychiatric  disorders  caused  no  concern  in  the  weight  management 
programme. Patients at risk for suicidality or with eating disorders were excluded from the trials. 
No new data with respect to safety of interactions beyond what has been provided from the Victoza 
development  program,  were  presented;  the  Applicant’s  approach  to  interactions  is  based  on 
equivalence  with  Victoza.  According  to  trial  3630,  gastric  emptying  after  5 hours  is  equivalent 
between  liraglutide  doses  of  1.8  and  3.0  mg.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  potential  for  interactions  is 
significantly different between obesity and T2DM.  
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015

In  the  Victoza  programme,  no  effect  of  liraglutide  on  QTc  was  observed.  This  was  confirmed  for 
Saxenda  by  an  analysis  of  ECGs  from  a  subset  of  patients  in  the  phase-3  programme  in  weight 
management.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Overall, the higher liraglutide dose in comparison to liraglutide used in T2DM (Victoza) seems to have 
little effect on the AE rate, except for gastrointestinal events which are more frequent. However, the 
comparisons in the dose-finding trial 1807 and T2DM trial 1922 are underpowered to assess the rates 
of rare events such as pancreatitis, cardiovascular events and neoplasms.  
There is no evidence of an overall increased number of malignancies in the weight management 
program. However, the numbers of events were too low for sound statistical analysis and some types 
of neoplasms show a numerical disadvantage for liraglutide 3.0 mg (breast).  
Medication errors related to the device cannot be adequately addressed based on the phase 3 
trials as the proposed commercial device is different from the device used in these trials. However, the 
results of the usability study are reassuring. 
For  the  T2DM  indication,  a  large  cardiovascular  safety  study  (LEADER)  is  on-going.  Although  the 
extrapolation of data from LEADER to Saxenda is not straightforward (different indication, different 
population, different dose), the trial is expected to provide additional valuable information. However, 
as the trial is on-going, data are not available to maintain the blind. The Data Monitoring Committee 
supervises the trial regularly and has recommended normal continuation of the trial. The final report 
of this trial is expected in 2016.  
Data in special  populations are sparse. Exposure in older patients above 75 years is very limited 
(n=17 for liraglutide 3.0 mg) and “not recommended” in the SmPC. Similarly, exposure of severely 
renally impaired patients is limited to only 3 patients on active treatment and is not recommended. 
Exposure in subjects with hepatic impairment is reduced based on the PK trial. Use in severe hepatic 
impairment is “not recommended” because exposure is reduced by 44%. Use in mild or moderate 
hepatic  impairment  should  be  with  caution,  as  efficacy  and  safety  in  this  population  are  not 
investigated.  
Data  with  regard  to  safety  beyond  1  year  of  treatment  were  primarily  available  from  the 
extension  of  dose-finding  trial  1807,  where  AE  rates  for  subjects  using  liraglutide  for  weight 
management could be compared to event rates with orlistat (the only comparator used in the second 
year of trial 1807). With the day 120 and 180 responses, additional interim data from the extension 
of trial 1839 have been added, which confirm the safety profile established during the main trials. In 
total, in trial 1839 and its double blind, placebo controlled extension up to 1-Oct-2014, 903 subjects 
were exposed to liraglutide 3.0 mg for ≥2 years and 694 patients were exposed for 3 years.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
According  to  the  weight  reduction  guideline  (CPMP/EWP/281/96  -  2007)  an  important  goal  of 
treatment  of  obesity  is  to  prevent  associated  morbidity  and  mortality.  The  over-all  effect  on 
weight loss by Saxenda is considered clinically relevant.  After treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg, 
weight loss was 7.5% with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. 2.3% with placebo, a placebo-subtracted weight loss 
of  5.2%,  with  narrow  confidence  intervals.  10%-Responders  were  30.5%  for  liraglutide  3.0 mg  v 
8.4% for placebo. This is also in accordance with the requirement of the guideline. Saxenda is at least 
as efficacious as Victoza for glucose regulation. This may be important for patients with treatment 
targets  related  to  both  diabetes  and  weight  loss.  The  other  secondary  endpoints  related  to 
cardiovascular  risk  that  were  included  in  the  testing  hierarchy  all  tested  statistically  significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/143005/2015

However, the actual treatment benefits were small and often directly related to weight loss. Thus, 
these  endpoints  validate  the  weight  loss,  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  most  of  these  endpoints  is 
limited. The effects on glycaemic control and SBP are independent on weight loss. 
The low follow up at 56 weeks is a major shortcoming of the trials; post-hoc correction seems not 
possible.  Missing  endpoint  data  were  imputed  for  21.7%  of  participants.  Based  on  the  sensitivity 
analyses that are provided, the impact of imputations on the estimate of the treatment effect may be 
around 1%. Also, the effect is not consistent in all subgroups. The estimates of the treatment effect in 
males (-3.56%) and in patients with T2DM (-3.95%) and in male T2DM (-2.93%) patients are below 
the  overall  estimate  (-5.2%).  The  proposed  stopping  rule  performs  acceptably  in  all  subgroups, 
leading to more expected discontinuations in males and T2DM patients when applied.  
Treatment  discontinuation  is  associated  with  weight  regain.  The  Applicant  provided  data  of 
3-months re-randomised follow up. In these 3 months, with continued counselling, weight regain was 
+2.91%;  obviously.  This  was  in  a  completers  population,  therefore  after  these  3  months  the 
difference with the original placebo group was still -3.66% to their original baseline weight. It is likely 
that the treatment effect will continue to decrease after the 3 months that were investigated. The 
prospect of lifelong treatment for weight management may concern potential users.  
A favourable change over time in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) occurred in both treatment 
groups.  The  Applicant  did  not  show  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  differences  between  treatment 
groups. The outcome of the PROs may be biased by the burden of daily injections as these may foster 
the opinion that the medicine is strong and effective. The injections weigh in equally at end of trial for 
both active and placebo treatment. Therefore, the Quality of Life scales did not measure the burden 
of therapy caused by the  injections as also the control patients got injected (sham injections). Of 
course, adverse effects like nausea did come up in the questionnaires.  
The  interpretation  of  the sleep-apnoea  related  parameters  is  difficult,  as  there  is  no  established 
margin for clinical relevance.  
Regarding  unfavourable  effects,  the  use  (and  dose)  of  liraglutide  is  limited  by  GI-symptoms. 
Gastrointestinal  adverse  events  are  very  frequent  with  Saxenda,  especially  early  during  therapy, 
leading to a high number of withdrawals for AEs (9.5%). As with Victoza, the dose is gradually titrated 
over  4  weeks  that  mitigates  this  problem  somewhat.  Saxenda  is  administrated  as  subcutaneous 
injections and associated with many injection site reactions (22.9 events per 100 PYE). Most issues of 
long-term effects resemble those with GLP-1 analogues as seen in T2DM, but now within the context 
of the indication of weight control. In a population of overweight/obese, risks are more important than 
when treating a disease like T2DM. 
The  risks  of  pancreatitis  and  gallbladder  events  do  not  increase  over  time  and  can  thus  be 
accurately estimated from the phase 3 data. The rate of pancreatitis was numerically higher in the 
weight management programme (0.6 events per 100 PYE) than in T2DM (0.2 events per 100 PYE), 
which could be related to different methods of data collection, the indication, the weight loss, the 
dose, or a combination hereof. It is also conceivable that some of the events of acute pancreatitis are 
related  to  acute  gallstone  disease  that  was  identified  as  a  new  adverse  drug  reaction  in  this 
programme.  The  low  number  of  pancreatitis  events  precludes  further  analysis.  Although  these 
pancreatitis events usually lead to hospitalisation, recovery is often quick and without sequelae. The 
risk of acute gall stone disease is related to the weight loss that was achieved. However, even when 
correcting for weight loss, a further contribution of liraglutide is likely.  
There  is  limited  information  about  long-term  (>1  year)  safety.  Dose-responsiveness  for  rare 
events  cannot  be  excluded  based  on  current  data.  This  implies  that  other  uncertain  risks  such 
malignancies cannot be judged accurately with use of the T2DM data. Such events are of relevance 
because they are associated with severe morbidity and mortality (see discussion of the RMP). Some

types of neoplasms show a numerical disadvantage for liraglutide 3.0 mg (breast cancer and benign 
colon neoplasms), which could be a chance finding but needs follow-up in the RMP, similar to GLP-1 
analogues in general. 
Important  events  of  hypoglycaemia  only  occurred  in  subjects  taking  other  hypoglycaemic 
treatments for T2DM, in particular SU derivatives. This is consistent with liraglutide’s mode of actions, 
which  stimulates  insulin  secretion  only  during  hyperglycaemia.  When  liraglutide  is  used  in  T2DM, 
glucose lowering therapy must be adapted, which  is addressed in the SmPC. 
The final major issue is the increase in heart rate and its implications for the cardiovascular risk. The 
Applicant  has  put  forward  some  valid  issues  regarding  this  uncertainty.  Although  related  to  its 
mechanism of  action, it is not accompanied by an increase of activity of the  sympathetic nervous 
system,  it  appears  not  to  be  dose-related  and  data  so  far  with  GLP1-analogues  including  several 
meta-analyses do not suggest a signal of a deleterious effect on cardiovascular outcome. Also, as 
indicated  above,  other  risk  factors  may  be  favourably  altered.  Data  on  Saxenda  so  far  appear 
reassuring, but it should be recognised that the studied population is a low risk population with a low 
number of events. More convincing data will have to be obtained from the LEADER study. To address 
the concern relating to the increase in pulse rate, it is recommended as a precaution in SmPC section 
4.4 to discontinue the drug when a clinically relevant sustained increase in heart rate occurs.  
No separate analysis is shown for safety after application of the stopping rule. Safety is likely in line 
with  the  overall  population.  Based  on  larger  weight  loss,  the  risk  of  gall  bladder  events  may  be 
relatively higher. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall B/R of Saxenda is positive, provided that the Applicant commits to perform a number of 
post authorisation measures.  
While the risks of gall bladder disease and pancreatitis have been established and discussed in the 
SmPC, the acceptability of these risks in an overweight but otherwise healthy population should be 
considered  on  an  inidividual  basis,  especially  if  the  primary  goal  of  therapy  is  a  reduction  in  the 
cardiovascular risk. The data on breast cancer and colon neoplasms currently do not prove or disprove 
a tumour promoting effect of Saxenda. 
Saxenda’s efficacy is moderate, in particular in men, but is still considered clinically relevant when 
viewing the results on primary and secondary endpoints in totality. 
According to the Applicant, the ongoing post-authorisation commitments for Victoza (liraglutide 1.2 
and 1.8 mg for T2DM) will provide information regarding the long-term safety of Saxenda pertaining 
to the concerns raised by the CHMP (risks associated with increase in pulse, pancreatitis, malignant 
breast and benign colon neoplasms).  
Based on phase 2 and 3 data, there is no dose response relationship for the increase in heart rate. As 
discussed  before,  gall  bladder  events  are  likely  dose  related.  The  number  of  pancreatitis  and 
malignancy  events  is  too  low  to  allow  assessment  of  dose-responsiveness.  Therefore,  the 
commitments from the Victoza programme are of limited value for the assessment of pancreatitis, gall 
bladder events and neoplasms. 
LEADER  includes  5500  subjects  with  BMI  >30 kg/m2  and  T2DM,  which  could  be  candidates  for 
Saxenda  (if  weight  reduction  would  be  selected  as  treatment  target).  These  subjects  represent  a 
group with high CV risk as a result of atherosclerotic disease. LEADER is designed as a CV safety trial, 
but in fact measures the net result of CV efficacy and safety. In general, the weight management 
population  (younger,  more  females)  has  lower  CV  risk  and  thus  lower  expected  benefits  than  the 
Assessment report

LEADER  population.  A  dedicated  CV  outcome  trial  of  Saxenda,  with  an  ‘enriched  population’  to 
improve feasibility would mimic LEADER except for the dose. 
It is not known, if LEADER participants would also be at higher risk for any adverse long-term effect 
of  the  increase  in  pulse  rate,  although  they  are  likely  susceptible.  As  LEADER  is  designed  as  a 
non-inferiority trial, no confirmatory evidence for any benefits is expected. Effects in subjects with 
hypertension, dyslipidaemia or mobility disorders (but without T2DM) are not assessed with LEADER. 
Thus, the position of the Applicant that the results of the studies included in the pharmacovigilance 
plan  for  Victoza  will  be  fully  applicable  to  Saxenda,  is  not  supported  due  to  differences  in  patient 
population and dosage. If the results of LEADER would be ambiguous in this high risk population a 
need for a separate CV outcome study with Saxenda cannot be excluded, whereas this would likely be 
not the case if results would suggest a beneficial effect on CV outcome. Therefore, it will be important 
to assess the data from LEADER also with respect to Saxenda once the results are available. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The fact that Saxenda is to be injected and may cause nausea in a substantial number of patients can 
be an obstacle for many patients, but this is not a major issue in terms of benefit-risk; it is more a 
choice that speaks for the patient’s motivation. 
Benefits  have  been  shown  on  weight  and  weight-related  co-morbidities,  in  particular  on  blood 
pressure  that  are  considered  surrogate  for  cardiovascular  outcome.  Also,  an  effect  on  obstructive 
sleep-apnoea has been demonstrated, although the relevance is still questioned. In terms of risks, 
pancreatitis and cholecystitis are identified risks, but in the context of their low incidence and the 
population at risk for CV disease, they can be accepted. The uncertainty regarding the occurrence of 
neoplasms is addressed further in the RMP and thus this is not considered a remaining issue. The 
increase in heart rate is assessed in the context of the overall effect on CV outcome. 
As  indicated  above,  available  evidence  at  the  moment  shows  a  lack  of  deleterious  effect  on 
cardiovascular outcome, with even a suggestion of a beneficial effect, and the mechanism of action 
has been studied extensively.  It is agreed with the Applicant that 1-year safety of Saxenda is covered 
by the clinical trials. As indicated by the Applicant, the report for the LEADER trial will be finalised and 
provided to the CHMP in 2016 and its results are expected to further characterise the safety profile of 
liraglutide also with regard to Saxenda. 
During the assessment, an alternative, more restricted target population was discussed, i.e. adults 
with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and at least one weight related comorbidity in whom, based on the assumption 
of a higher baseline CV risk, possibly more benefits could be expected on CV outcome in the long 
term. However efficacy in terms of weight loss was similar to the original target population and no 
data is available to show such a differential long-term CV benefit. During the assessment, a stopping 
rule  was  proposed    that  treatment  with  Saxenda  should  only  continue  after  12 weeks  on  the 
3.0 mg/day dose in those patients who have lost at least 5% of their initial body weight; the stopping 
rule will protect subjects from long-term use of a non-effective therapy. After discussion, the CHMP 
concluded that the B/R is positive on the available data in the original target population subject to 
adherence to such a stopping rule.

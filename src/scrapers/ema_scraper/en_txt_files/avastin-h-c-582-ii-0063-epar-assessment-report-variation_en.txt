2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ovarian cancer (cancer that arises in the epithelium including epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC], fallopian 
tube cancer [FTC], and primary peritoneal cancer [PPC]) is a disease that globally affects nearly a 
quarter of a million women each year. It is the eighth most common cancer in women and the seventh 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014

leading cause of cancer death among women, responsible for approximately 140,000 deaths each 
year. It has the highest mortality rate of all gynaecological cancers (WHO 2011, ACS 2011). In 2008, 
with an incidence of approximately 65,600 women, there were 41,448 deaths due to ovarian cancer 
across Europe, accounting for 5.5% of all female cancer deaths. Europeans have the highest incidence 
of ovarian cancer and it is the fifth most commonly diagnosed female cancer in Europe. 
Recurrent disease is classified as platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive, depending on whether the 
disease recurs < or ≥ 6 months following previous platinum therapy, respectively; this classification is 
highly prognostic and is important in determining treatment options. Eventually, all recurrent ovarian 
cancer patients develop platinum-resistant disease for which there are few effective treatment options 
currently available. Patients with platinum-resistant disease are usually treated with single-agent, non- 
platinum chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, the prognosis for platinum-resistant recurrence is dismal, 
with response rates to current therapies at best ranging from 10% to 20%, with few durable 
responses, median progression free survival (PFS) ranging from 2 − 5 months, and median overall 
survival (OS) ≤12 months (Gordon 2001, Naumann 2011). 
Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody. It inhibits angiogenesis by 
neutralising all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and blocking their 
binding to VEGF receptors. 
Avastin (bevacizumab) was approved in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2005 for the first-line 
treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum (mCRC) in combination with 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. 
The indication was subsequently extended to include treatment of locally recurrent and metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel or capecitabine, for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 
in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, the first-line treatment of Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) in 
combination with interferon alfa-2a,  treatment of advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel and 
treatment of first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelian ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine. 
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin. The 
indication initially claimed by the MAH was: 
‘‘Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with recurrence of platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy 
regimens’’. 
The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
‘‘Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy 
regimens and who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF 
receptor–targeted agents (see Section 5.1.)’’. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the change in 
the indication accordingly. The PL has been updated accordingly.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH did not submit an ERA since bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody (protein), and is therefore 
exempt from the need for an ERA. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a justification for not supplying an ERA assessment for this extension of 
indication application. 
The EMA 2006 Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for Non-GMO Human Medicinal 
Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) specifically lists amino acids, peptides and proteins among those 
active pharmaceutical ingredients which do not need an ERA for registration or variations in the 
European Union. The active ingredient of Avastin (Bevacizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is a 
recombinant humanised immunoglobulin of isotype IgG1. As a protein, bevacizumab is exempt from 
the need for an ERA. 
Therefore the MAH’s justification for not providing an ERA with this application is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
One Phase III clinical trial, Study MO22224 (AURELIA), assessed the efficacy and safety of 
bevacizumab given in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 
for the treatment of women with recurrent, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), primary 
peritoneal cancer (PPC), or fallopian tube cancer (FTC). 
Bevacizumab is already approved for, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, front-line 
treatment of adult patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
(FIGO) stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine, first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or 
other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with these gynecological cancers has not been 
characterized in the target population, but the PK of bevacizumab is not expected to differ in these 
patients compared to other solid tumours.

The volume of distribution ranged from 2.5 – 3.6 L. No protein binding is expected for this monoclonal 
antibody. The volume of distribution in patients with mRCC and NSCLC was comparable to the values 
obtained in other oncology settings. For patients with mPC the median and mean volume of distribution 
was slightly higher than the reference population, however this was due to a difference in the 
covariate distribution (male/female ratio was higher than in the reference population). A half-life of 
20 days in patients with mRCC, NSCLC and metastatic PC patients was comparable to the reference 
popPK analyses where the half-life was app. 20 days (range 11-50 days). Clearance was approximately 
0.23 L/day (range 0,178 – 0,270) which is also similar to the values seen in the 3 studies in patients 
with mRCC, NSCLC and metastatic PC. 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was linear (dose independent) and exposure was dose 
proportional at doses of >1 mg/kg (1.5-10 mg/kg/wk). Body weight, sex and albumin levels are 
important covariates that explain 40% of the inter-patient variance of clearance. Male patients had a 
26% faster clearance than female patients (weight corrected) and lower albumin levels (< 29 g/L) was 
associated with a 20% lower clearance than for patients with albumin of 37 g/L. 
There are no data on drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with bevacizumab in combination with topotecan 
and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Few data on co-administration of bevacizumab and paclitaxel 
exist. In 3 of 8 patients receiving both bevacizumab and paclitaxel, paclitaxel was found in lower 
concentrations than at day 0 of the study, compared to the paclitaxel concentrations in patients 
treated only with paclitaxel. However, these data are limited and is not expected to influence the 
dosing. No DDIs have been observed between bevacizumab and various chemotherapeutic agents. 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was not described in the target population of women with 
recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) or 
fallopian tube cancer (FTC). As the PK of bevacizumab was shown to be similar in a variety of oncology 
indications, the PK of bevacizumab is expected to have the same PK profile in these gynaecological 
cancers. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Bevacizumab  PK  was  not  evaluated  in  patients  with  gynaecological  cancers.  However  as  the 
bevacizumab PK has been shown to be similar in patients with various solid tumours it can be inferred 
that this also applies to recurrent, platinum-resistant EOC, PPC and FTC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies have been submitted with bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent 
platinum resistant EOC, FTC or PPC. The dose of bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV q2w or bevacizumab 15 
mg/kg IV q3w, which is equivalent to a dose of 5 mg/kg/week, is the most commonly used dose of 
bevacizumab that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials across multiple tumour types (e.g. 
non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic breast cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum, and front-line and recurrent treatment of EOC, FTC, and PPC). Phase 
II trials GOG-170D and AVF2949g, in ovarian cancer patients, demonstrated that a dose of 
bevacizumab equivalent to 15 mg/kg q3w had activity in the recurrent setting. Furthermore, 15 mg/kg 
q3w is the currently approved dose in the front-line and recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer 
settings based on a demonstrated benefit in Phase III trials.

PLD 40 mg/m2  as a 1 mg/min IV infusion. 
In the CT+BV arm, the chosen chemotherapy was combined with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV q2w (or 
bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q3w if used in combination with topotecan 1.25 mg/m2 on Days 1–5 on a q3w 
schedule). The initial bevacizumab infusion was over 90 minutes, with subsequent infusions over 60 
minutes and then 30 minutes, as tolerated.

Upon clear evidence of disease progression (PD per RECIST 1.0), patients in the CT arm were given 
the opportunity to crossover to bevacizumab monotherapy, and the treatment was continued until 
disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or patient request for discontinuation. 
Study treatment continued until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or patient request for 
withdrawal. In addition, any Grade 4 non-hematologic adverse event led to the withdrawal of the 
patient from the study treatment. A dosing delay of up to 3 weeks was allowed in case of Grade 3 non- 
hematologic adverse events to reduce toxicity to baseline or Grade 0−1. Bevacizumab dose reductions 
were not allowed. With treatment related toxicities, chemotherapy doses could be reduced using 
individual schedules for each chemotherapy drug. No dose re-escalations were planned following dose 
reduction for toxicity for any of the study treatments. 
Response assessment 
Patients were assessed for disease response or progression every 8 or 9 weeks, throughout the study 
until PD, depending on the chemotherapy schedule, using the same imaging method used during 
screening (CT scan or MRI or plain X-ray). Tumour assessments were only performed post-study 
treatment in the absence of confirmation of disease progression, at 8-week intervals. Patients were 
followed up with tumour assessments for a minimum of 6 months unless disease progression occurred 
earlier.  Survival follow-up continued at least until the last patient had completed a minimum of 12 
months after the end of treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the pivotal study M022224 was to compare the efficacy (progression free 
survival, PFS) of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (CT+BV) versus chemotherapy (CT) alone. The key 
secondary objectives included the evaluation of efficacy by objective response rate (ORR), overall 
survival (OS) and duration of response and the evaluation of  the safety profile of CT+BV vs. CT alone. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was PFS, defined as the time from randomization to 
investigator-assessed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease 
progression was determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.0 or by symptomatic 
deterioration, whichever occurred first. Progression was not declared based on rising CA-125 levels 
alone. 
The key secondary endpoints were the following: 
Objective response rate (ORR) defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) 
determined by investigators according to RECIST, in patients with measurable disease at baseline. 
Duration of objective response, defined as the time from first occurrence of confirmed PR or CR 
(whichever occurred first) until disease progression determined by investigators according to RECIST; 
or death. 
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. 
Abdominal or GI Symptom Scale in QLQ-OV28: The primary patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure 
is the proportion of patients who have experienced a clinically meaningful improvement at Week 8 or 9 
in an ovarian cancer−related abdominal/GI symptom as manifested in the abdominal/GI symptom 
scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (QLQ) ovarian cancer 28 (OV28) at week 8 or 9. 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014 
Page 12/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory endpoints included ORR by CA-125 response criteria only (CA-125 response was defined 
according to the GCIG criteria as a ≥ 50% decrease, which had to be confirmed by another 
measurement at least 28 days later), time to biological progression on the basis of a progressive serial 
elevation of serum CA-125 alone, other measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
frequency of paracentesis. 
Sample size 
On the basis of a two-sided test at an α level of 0.05 for the comparison of primary endpoint PFS 
between the two treatment arms, about 247 PFS events in the two treatment arms combined would be 
required to achieve 80% power to detect an HR of 0.70. Under the exponential assumption, the 
corresponding improvement of median PFS is from 4.0 months in the CT arm to 5.7 months in the 
CT+BV arm. The corresponding sample size was 332 patients. In January 2011, when approximately 
300 patients were enrolled, the sample size was increased to 360 patients per the recommendation of 
the independent Data Monitoring Committee. 
The final analysis of OS was planned when 253 deaths from the two treatment arms had been 
observed. Under the assumption that the median OS was 14 months in the CT arm and the observed 
HR for death with the addition of bevacizumab was 0.78, approximately 253 deaths would be required 
for the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HR to be 1. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to CT+BV or CT alone and were stratified by the following three factors:

Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the PFS survivor functions between the two 
treatment arms using a two-sided stratified log-rank test. The null hypothesis for the primary efficacy 
analysis was that there would be no difference in the PFS survivor functions between the two  
treatment arms. The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the ITT population (all patients who 
were randomised to one of the two treatment arms) and was planned to be repeated using the Per 
Protocol (PP) population (subset of ITT population who have received at least one study treatment  
cycle and had no major violation of the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm overall study 
results). 
The Kaplan−Meier method was used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. The 
Brookmeyer−Crowley method was used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS for each 
treatment arm. Further, the HR was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same 
three stratification factors used in the stratified log-rank test in order to assess the magnitude of the 
Avastin  Assessment  report

treatment effect. The analysis using the Cox-regression model was also performed in a non-stratified 
manner. 
The PFS data for patients who had not experienced disease progression and who had not died at the 
clinical cut-off date were censored at the date of the last tumour assessment on or before the clinical 
cut-off date (or at day 1 otherwise), regardless of the initiation of non−protocol-specified anti-cancer 
therapy (NPT) or crossover of patients in the CT arm to bevacizumab monotherapy. 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed using the same statistical methods applied in the 
primary analysis of PFS:  effect of discontinuation because of toxicity; effect of NPT and bevacizumab 
monotherapy; backdating progressive disease date in the CT+BV arm; backdating PFS event date in 
the CT+BV arm; accounting for missing data; accounting for the initiation of NPT and bevacizumab 
monotherapy; and accounting for CA-125 PD. 
Computer simulations were performed to generate hypothetical IRC tumor assessment data. The 
primary analysis approach was performed on each simulated dataset.  Stratified HRs and log-rank p- 
values were summarized for each scenario. 
In the first set of simulations, the IRC tumor assessment data were simulated 10,000 times under each 
of the following scenarios based on the assumption of the concordance rate observed in a phase II 
study in 44 platinum resistant EOC/PPC patients AVF 4095g: 
1.  Investigator-determined PD events were not confirmed by IRC (in both arms 20% of PD events not 
considered as PD events by IRC) 
2.  Investigator-determined PD events were earlier per IRC: 20% of PD events backdated to the last 
tumor assessment date before the PD date in both arms. Another random subset of 20% was 
backdated to the second last tumor assessment. 
3.  Investigator-determined PD events were not confirmed or were earlier per IRC by combining the 
above two scenarios. 
Second set of simulations with more conservative assumptions: 
4.  Investigator-determined PD events were not confirmed by IRC: in the CT arm, the investigator- 
determined PD events were lost at the same rate of 20% as in scenario 1.  In the CT+BV arm, a 
random subset of only 1% of PD events was not considered as PD events by IRC. 
5.  Investigator-determined PD events were earlier per IRC: in the CT+BV arm, the investigator- 
determined PD events were backdated at the same rate as in scenario 2.  In the CT arm, a random 
subset of only 10% of PD events was backdated to the last tumor assessment date before the PD 
date.  And another random subset of 10% of PD events was backdated to the second to last tumor 
assessment dates before the PD dates. 
6.  Investigator-determined PD events were not confirmed or earlier per IRC: by combining scenarios 
4 and 5. 
Subgroup analysis 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median time to event, the unstratified HR, and its 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of PFS were produced for several demographic and baseline prognostic characteristics.

Recruitment 
The first patient was randomized on 29 October 2009 and the last on 14 November 2011. A total of 
361 patients were randomized at 96 sites in Europe. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol for Study MO22224 was finalized on 4 May 2009 and was subsequently amended three 
times. 
The first amendment was finalized on 24 November 2009, by which date 6 patients were randomized 
and the following clarifications and changes were provided: 
• The definition of platinum resistance was made more specific to define platinum resistance as 
progression within < 6 months from completion of a minimum of 4 platinum therapy cycles, with the 
date calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy. 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014 
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• The definition of prior therapies was clarified to include all previous anti-cancer therapy, including 
those received in the front-line or recurrent settings. 
• To clarify that it was not a requirement in RECIST for the same investigator to evaluate the patient at 
each assessment. 
• The statistical analysis for the primary endpoint was updated from a one- to a two-sided log-rank 
test. The sample size and statistical assumptions were updated accordingly, such that a total of 282 
patients were needed to observe 247 events which would be sufficient to yield 80% power for a two- 
sided log rank test at an alpha level of 5%. Taking into consideration a potential patient drop 
bevacizumab out, the sample size was adjusted by approximately 15% and therefore a total of 332 
patients were enrolled into the study, with 166 patients randomized to either treatment arm. 
• The numbers of patients randomized to chemotherapy cohorts was amended because of statistical 
changes to include 120 patients per chemotherapy cohort. 
• The timing of QoL assessments was amended so that it was more suited to the scheduling of cycle 
visits, the timing of the 3 worst symptom questionnaire was collected at baseline only, and the use of 
the 3 worst symptom questionnaire methodology was described in more detail. 
• The protocol was updated so that all Grade 2 adverse events were collected. Previously, it was only 
necessary to collect Grade 3–5 adverse events and clinically significant Grade 2 adverse events only. 
• Clarification of how a patient who had been previously enrolled in a blinded study with an anti- 
angiogenic was to be stratified. 
• The frequency of CA-125 assessments was corrected to be performed every cycle and not at every 
visit. 
• A window of flexibility was permitted for cycle visits ( ± 3 days). This flexibility was also applied to 
follow-up visits to allow for public holidays/clinic scheduling. 
• The end-of-treatment assessment was corrected to be calculated from the last dose of study 
medication. 
• Clarification that the previously described “optional post-study phase” for patients randomized to the 
CT arm was for the CT arm patients only and that bevacizumab was to be given as part of the study to 
those patients who opted to receive crossover bevacizumab monotherapy. 
• Additional safety guidance to clarify the management of bevacizumab in the event of CNS bleeding, 
proteinuria management, and hypersensitivity with paclitaxel. 
• The definition of residual disease was amended based on the presence or absence of macroscopic 
disease. 
•One of the definitions of progression for patients with measurable disease at randomization was 
further described and specified that every effort would be made to document progressive disease 
objectively and the definition of progression for patients with non-measurable disease at randomization 
was further detailed and corrected. 
The protocol for Study MO22224 was amended a second time on 28 October 2010, by which date 236 
patients were randomized, and the following key clarifications and changes were provided: 
• Clarification regarding the exclusion criteria for platinum refractory disease, peripheral neuropathy, 
and previous malignancies. 
• Addition of LVEF assessments every fourth cycle for patients receiving PLD. 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014 
Page 16/57 
 
• Additional requirement to capture certain concomitant medication in the eCRF, particularly supportive 
medication prescribed for the treatment of cancer-related symptoms or potential side effects of 
chemotherapy. 
• Clarification that only serious adverse events caused by protocol-mandated interventions needed to 
be collected prior to initiation of study medication and that all serious adverse events needed to be 
collected before, during, and after study drug dosing. 
• Guidance on dose modification to reflect the bevacizumab safety profile. 
• Clarification to ensure that only those patients who experienced disease progression on 
chemotherapy alone were able to subsequently receive bevacizumab on the bevacizumab crossover 
option. 
The protocol for Study MO22224 was amended a third time on 23 January 2013 in order to allow for a 
potential retrospective scan collection and a review of scans by an independent review committee 
(IRC).

Table 8. PFS as Determined by the IRC by Baseline Risk Factor: Randomized Patients 
Simulation analysis 
The  IRC  tumor  assessment  data  were  simulated  under  different  scenarios.  In  the  first  set  of 
simulations,  the  same  assumptions  were  made  for  both  arms  regarding  the  rates  at  which  the 
investigator-determined  PD  events  were  either  lost  or  assessed  at  an  earlier  tumor  assessment  date. 
In  the  second  set  of  simulations,  more  conservative  assumptions  were  made  in  favor  of  the  CT  arm. 
Under  all  scenarios,  the  log-rank  p-values  were  below  0.05,  even  for  the  worst  case  scenario 
simulated, when almost  all PD events (99%) in the CT+BV arm would  be  confirmed by IRC while only 
80%  of those in the  CT  arm  would  be  confirmed, and  only 20%  of the  confirmed  PD events in the  CT 
arm versus 40% of confirmed PD events in the CT+BV arm were assessed at an earlier date. Based on 
these  assumptions,  of  10,000  simulated  datasets,  the  median  of  the  stratified  HRs  was  0.56  (range: 
0.50−0.62).  The  analysis  of  these  simulated  data  indicated  that  the  results  of  an  IRC-determined  PFS 
analysis  would  likely  have  been  consistent  with  that  of  the  primary  analysis  based  on  investigator 
assessments, and  therefore  an independent  review of tumor scans  would  not  have  impacted  the  study 
conclusion (data not shown).

Duration of Objective Response 
The analysis of duration of objective response included only randomized patients with an objective 
response. Patients who had an objective response and did not experience disease progression or death 
by the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment. For the 18 patients in 
the CT arm and 40 patients in the CT+BV arm with an objective response, the median duration of 
objective response was 5.4 months in the CT arm and 9.4 months in the CT+BV arm (data not shown).

Abdominal/GI Symptom Scale in EORTC QLQ-OV28 
The QLQ-OV28 assessment was completed at baseline by 162 of 182 (89.0%) and 158 of 179 (88.3%) 
randomized patients in the CT and CT+BV arms, respectively. The CT+BV arm showed improvement at 
all assessment time points. In comparison, the CT arm showed worsening at Weeks 8/9, 16/18, and 
24, but not at Week 30.  In the CT+BV arm, the mean abdominal/GI symptom scale gradually 
decreased from baseline indicating that as a group, there was an improvement from baseline levels in 
the mean scores in abdominal/GI symptoms. In contrast, the CT arm showed worsening abdominal/GI 
symptoms from baseline over the study treatment period. 
Repeated measure mixed-effect model analysis, with baseline score as a covariate, was implemented 
for the absolute abdominal/GI symptom scale Overall, the mean difference between treatment arms 
was 6.1 points (95% CI: 1.1, 11.2; p = 0.0181) favoring CT+BV. The data showed neither a 
statistically significant temporal effect nor a statistically significant interaction between time and 
treatment (data not shown).

The Kaplan-Meier curves began to separate after 5 months (data not shown). 
Frequency of paracentesis 
Among patients in the CT arm, 8 patients required a total of 15 post-dosing procedures of paracentesis 
during  the  protocol  treatment  periods  (cycles)  1  through  8  on  the  basis  of  the  data  captured  on  the 
CRF.  In  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  required  one  post-dosing  procedure  of  paracentesis,  which 
occurred during treatment cycle 1 (data not shown). 
Other measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
Compliance rate 
The  primary  HRQoL  endpoint  (abdominal/GI  scale)  was  based  on  the  QLQ-OV28  module.  The 
compliance  rates  for  QLQ-C30  were  slightly  higher  than  the  compliance  rates  for  QLQ-OV28.  The 
compliance rates for FOSI and HADS were similar to the rates seen for the QLQ-OV28. 
Global health status/quality of life in EORTC QLQ-C30 
A  responder  analysis  of  GHS/QoL  was  performed  by  identifying  those  patients  with  an  occurrence  of 
improvement  in  each  arm  based  on  an  increase  in  the  QLQ-C30  GHS/QoL  scale  of  ≥10  points  from 
baseline  score.  Across  all  time  points, the  CT+BV  arm  consistently  showed  higher  response  rates  than 
the CT arm. Meanwhile, the mean change from baseline in the GHS/QoL in the CT+BV arm consistently 
indicated  an  improvement.  These  results  demonstrate  that  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
CT+BV  arm  improved  in  meaningful  levels  of  GHS/QoL,  and  as  a  group,  the  mean  level  of  GHS/QoL 
was numerically improved during treatment in the CT+BV arm. 
Functional scales in EORTC QLQ-OV28 and QLQ-C30 
Mean  score  changes  from  baseline  indicated  that  physical  function  for  the  CT+BV  arm  was  generally 
worse  over  time  than  at  baseline,  but  not  consistently  worse  than  the  CT  arm  in  terms  of  responder 
rate.  Cognitive  function  was  consistently  worse  in  the  CT+BV  arm  than  in  the  CT  arm  in  terms  of 
response  rate.  In  both  treatment  arms, the  cognitive  function was  worsened  over  time  compared  with 
the  respective  baseline  values,  suggesting  that  the  cognitive  function  of  patients,  no  matter  which 
protocol-specified treatment they received, worsened over time. 
Symptom scales in EORTC QLQ-OV28 and QLQ-C30 
The  CT+BV  arm  showed  advantages  compared  with  the  CT  arm  in  the  following  symptoms:  frequent 
urination,  fatigue,  and  peripheral  neuropathy.  Of  the  remaining  symptom  scales,  diarrhea  and  hearing 
were  worse  in  the  CT+BV  arm.  Other  symptoms  did  not  show  differences  between  the  two  arms. 
However,  there  were  some  notable  changes  in  symptoms.  In  both  arms,  there  were  improvements  in 
insomnia, and symptom worsening in skin problems, taste disturbance, and hair loss. 
FOSI and HADS 
Planned  analyses  were  conducted  on  both  FOSI  and  HADS.  No  evidence  of  treatment  effect  was 
demonstrated by these two instruments.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  open-label  design of  study MO22224 could  have  led  to  bias with  regard  to  PFS  and  OS. However, 
an independent review of data (PFS by IRC) support the PFS by INV. 
There  is  a  difference  in  the  timing  of  imaging  between  the  two  treatment  arm,  and  the  INV  and  IRC. 
However,  sensitivity  analysis,  where  backdating  of  PD  dates  only  in  the  CT+Bv  arm,  supported  the 
primary  estimate.  Thus,  there  are  no  major  implications  of  the  differences.  The  robustness  of  the 
overall  PFS  estimate  was  addressed  in  a  computer  simulated  IRC  analysis  and  in  several  sensitivity 
analyses. 
Patients  in  the  topotecan+Bv  group  seem  to  respond  better  to  treatment  compared  to  PLD+Bv  or 
paclitaxel+Bv when looking at PFS. However, when looking at the OS subgroup analyses, it seems that 
patients in the topetecan+Bv have a poorer OS compared to the other cohorts. This could be a chance 
finding.  Post-progression  therapy  may  have  confounded  the  OS  estimate,  but  no  data  has  been 
collected. 
There  were  only  16  patients  over  75  years  included  in  this  study.  Therefore  no  definitive  conclusions 
can  be  drawn  regarding  efficacy  results  in  this  group.  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  has  been  updated  to 
reflect it. 
Information on race is lacking due to the fact that the ethics committee in some countries do not allow 
collection  of  such  data.  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  reflect  it.  The  missing  data  on 
prior  surgery  in  6%  of  the  patients  is  explained  with  a  potentially  long  time-span  from  surgery  to 
inclusion.

The MAH stated that the decision to include only the abdominal/GI symptom scale of the QLQ-OV28 as 
a  secondary  endpoint  was  proclaimed  in  Amendment  1.  However,  the  time  point  of  the  final  analysis 
has been decided almost  a year after the  database  locks. This is considered  questionable  as there  is a 
good  chance  that  this  decision  has  been  data-driven.  Consequently  the  reliability  of  this  analysis  is  in 
question  and  cannot  be  credited  in  the  benefit-risk  evaluation.  Over  the  last  few  years  a  number  of 
papers  have  been  published  aiming  at  identifying  signatures  or  individual  biomarkers  predictive  of 
response  to  bevacizumab.  The  MAH will  submit  an  updated  biomarker  report  to  the  EMA  in  June  2014 
as part of the annual reports of the Annex II condition. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from the study revealed a median progression free survival of 6.7 months for the CT+BV group 
and 3.4 months for the CT group. 
Concerning  subgroup  analyses of PFS, there was a variation on how well the IRC evaluation supported 
the INV based PFS estimate, and it was in the paclitaxel cohort it was most convincing. With regard to 
patients  that  had  received  prior  anti-angiogenic  therapy,  there  seems  to  be  a  negative  effect  of 
bevacizumab  when  added  to  CT  with  regard  to  OS  and  no  effect  on  PFS.  The  indication  has  been 
revised to include a statement with regard to prior anti-angiogenic treatment in order to reflect it. 
The  key  secondary  endpoint  (ORR)  shows  a  clear  benefit  in  favour  of  CT+Bv,  and  this  finding  is 
supported by longer duration of objective response. 
No  overall  detrimental  effect  of  CT+Bv  is  seen  on  OS.  It  was  only  in  the  paclitaxel  cohort  that  the 
improvement  in  PFS  was  supported  by  a  numerically  similar  improvement  in  OS.  Although  not 
statistically  significant  overall,  the  OS  improvement  in  the  paclitaxel-treated  group  appears  quite 
substantial  in  this  setting.  While  the  median  OS  on  CT  alone  is  about  13-14  months  whatever  the  CT 
applied,  it  is  increased  to  22  months  in  the  bevacizumab+paclitaxel  group  (borderline)  while  no  effect 
at all is observed in the other treatment groups. In section 5.1 of the SmPC the subgroup analyses for 
all three cohorts should be shown, both for PFS and OS in order to reflect the fact that the outcome in 
the three chemotherapy cohorts is not the same. 
Based on the HRQoL results, the addition bevacizumab to CT has no or little effect (in either direction) 
on  the  QoL.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  is  uncertain,  and  the  matter  is  further 
complicated by the open-label nature of the MO22224 study. 
2.4.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study MO22224 study has demonstrated that bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel, 
topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin resulted in an absolute gain in median PFS of 3.3 
months in adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have not 
received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
This result is considered clinically relevant. A number of sensitivity analyses have confirmed the 
robustness of the pooled result. A positive effect was seen in the subgroup analyses, however in the 
individual chemotherapy cohorts, the most robust effect was seen in the paclitaxel cohort. 
The result was supported by a marked increase in ORR and a longer duration of objective response. No 
overall detrimental effect of CT+Bv is seen on OS. Post-progression therapy may have confounded OS

results which may explain why the improvement in PFS was not supported by similar improvement in 
OS. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The evaluation of safety information for bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients 
with EOC, FTC, or PPC, who were considered to have platinum-resistant disease, is derived from the 
Phase III Study MO22224. 
Safety data up to the data cut-off date of 25 January 2013 were included in the safety analysis. The 
primary safety analysis was performed on the safety-evaluable population (N=360), which was defined 
as all randomized patients who received any full or partial dose of bevacizumab or chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel, topotecan, PLD). Safety was compared according to the treatment actually received 
(n=181 CT and n=179 CT+BV). 
Upon disease progression or toxicity, patients in the CT arm had the option to receive crossover 
bevacizumab monotherapy. In the CT arm, if the patient had crossed over to receive bevacizumab 
monotherapy, only data on or prior to the crossover were included in the primary analyses. The data 
after the crossover for these patients (N=72 for the last analysis period) were summarized separately 
in order to evaluate the safety parameters for the crossover bevacizumab monotherapy period. 
Patient exposure 
Chemotherapy exposure 
The median duration of chemotherapy was 19.9 weeks in the CT+BV arm versus 10.3 weeks the CT 
arm. 
For paclitaxel, the median number of cycles was 4.0 and 6.0 cycles in the CT and CT+BV arms, 
respectively. The percentage of patients who received 7 cycles or more was lower in the CT arm 
(12.7%) than in the CT+BV arm (33.3%). The median total paclitaxel dose was 2055.0 mg in the CT 
arm compared with 2794.0 mg in the CT+BV arm. The median dose intensity was 91.8% in the CT arm 
compared with 87.8% in the CT+BV arm. 
For topotecan, the median number of cycles was 6.0 cycles in the CT+BV arm versus 3.0 cycleswith 
the CT arm . The median total topotecan dose was 87.7 mg in the CT+BV arm versus 43.2 mg in the 
CT arm. The median dose intensity was 75.0% in the CT arm compared with 84.0% in the CT+BV arm. 
For PLD, the median number of cycles was 3.0 and 4.0 cycles in the CT and CT+BV arms, respectively. 
The median total PLD dose was 230.0 mg in the CT arm and 277.0 mg in the CT+BV arm. The median 
dose intensity was similar between treatment arms (CT: 100% vs. CT+BV: 99.5%). 
Bevacizumab exposure 
Only patients in the CT+BV arm received bevacizumab prior to disease progression.  The median 
number of treatment cycles was 6.0 cycles (range: 1−32). The median duration of bevacizumab 
treatment was 22.1 weeks, and the median dose intensity was 94.4%. The median total dose of 
bevacizumab was 6750.0 mg. Of 72 patients in the CT arm who received crossover bevacizumab 
monotherapy after documented disease progression (optional cross-over phase), the median number 
of cycles received was 4.5 cycles (range: 1−19). The median duration of bevacizumab treatment was 
11.6 weeks, and the median total dose of bevacizumab was 4194.0 mg

Duration of safety follow-up 
Duration of safety follow-up is calculated from the first dosing date of the study treatment until 30 
days after the last dosing date. For the 72 patients in the CT arm who had crossover bevacizumab 
monotherapy, the treatment period of bevacizumab monotherapy was excluded. The median duration 
of safety follow-up was nearly twice as long in the CT+BV arm compared with the CT arm (CT: 3.3 
months vs. CT+BV: 6.1 months).

Adverse events of special interest 
•  Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
Grade  2–5  ATEs  were  reported  in  one  patient  (0.6%)  in  the  CT  arm  and  3  patients  (1.7%)  in  the 
CT+BV  arm.  In  the  CT  arm,  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  pulmonary  artery  thrombosis  adverse 
event  47  days  after  start  of  treatment  that  was  considered  possibly  related  to  topotecan  and  ongoing 
at the clinical cutoff. 
In the CT+BV arm, the following ATEs were reported: 
-One patient experienced a Grade 4 ischemic stroke that occurred 62 days after start of treatment and 
was  considered  possibly related to  bevacizumab  treatment  and  unrelated  to  PLD,  and  resolved  without 
sequelae. 
-  One patient experienced a Grade 3  arterial occlusive  disease  event that  occurred  61  days after start 
of  treatment  and  was  reported  as  possibly  related  to  both  topotecan  and  bevacizumab,  and  resolved 
with sequelae. 
-  One patient experienced a Grade 3 arterial embolism event 36 days after start of treatment that was 
considered  possibly  related  to  bevacizumab  treatment,  unrelated  to  topotecan  treatment,  and 
resolved. 
•  Bleeding 
No  patients  experienced  CNS  bleeding.  Grade  3–5  non-CNS  bleeding  events  were  reported  in  2 
patients  (1.1%)  in  each  treatment  arm.  In  the  CT  arm,  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  GI 
hemorrhage that occurred 22 days after start of treatment and was assessed as unrelated to PLD; and 
one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  vaginal  hemorrhage  that  occurred  42  days after  start  of treatment, 
was assessed as unrelated to paclitaxel, and resolved. 
In the CT+BV arm, one patient experienced a Grade 4 GI hemorrhage that occurred 44 days after start 
of treatment, was assessed as possibly related to bevacizumab and unrelated to PLD, and was ongoing 
at  the  time  of  death  on  Day  57;  and  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  hemorrhagic  ascites  that 
occurred  65  days  after  start  of  treatment,  was  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  bevacizumab  and 
unrelated to topotecan, with additional data indicating that other possible factors for the event included 
pre-existing underlying disease – malignancy, and the event resolved. 
•  Congestive Heart Failure 
Grade 3–5  CHF  was reported  in one  patient  (0.6%) in each treatment  arm.  In  the  CT  arm,  a  Grade  5 
cardiac failure event occurred in one patient after 71 days of treatment and was assessed as unrelated 
to  PLD  chemotherapy.  In  the  CT+BV  arm,  a  50-year-old  patient  experienced  Grade  3  left  ventricular 
dysfunction that  was considered  unrelated to bevacizumab and  probably related  to  PLD  with onset  151 
days after start of treatment; this event resolved. 
• 
Febrile Neutropenia 
Grade 2–5  febrile  neutropenia was reported  in one patient  in each treatment arm. In the  CT arm, one 
patient  (0.6%)  experienced  a  Grade  4  event  of  febrile  neutropenia  that  was  assessed  as  probably 
related  to  paclitaxel  treatment  and  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cutoff.  In  the  CT+BV  arm, 
one  patient  (0.6%)  experienced  a  Grade  3  event  of  febrile  neutropenia  that  was  assessed  as  unlikely 
related to bevacizumab treatment, probably related to PLD treatment, and resolved. 
• 
Fistula and Abscess 
Grade  2–5  fistula  and  abscess  events  were  reported  in  no  patients  in  the  CT  arm  and  4  patients 
(2.2%) in the CT+BV arm. 
Avastin  Assessment  report

-  One  patient  developed  a  Grade  2  female  genital  tract  fistula  that  was  unrelated  to  bevacizumab  or 
topotecan treatment, occurred after 212 days from start of treatment, and resolved. 
-  One patient developed a Grade 2  vesical  fistula that occurred  7 days after the start of treatment and 
that  was unrelated to bevacizumab or paclitaxel treatment, and  was ongoing  at the time of the clinical 
cutoff. 
-  One  patient  developed  a Grade  3  vesical  fistula  that  occurred  169  days  after  start  of  treatment,  was 
assessed as probably related to bevacizumab treatment and unrelated to paclitaxel treatment, and was 
ongoing at the time of the clinical cutoff. 
-  One  patient  developed  a  Grade  4  female  genital  tract  fistula  that  occurred  34  days  after  start  of 
treatment,  was  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  bevacizumab  treatment  and  unrelated  to  paclitaxel 
treatment, and  resolved; the  patient  withdrew from study treatment. No  Grade  5  fistulae  or abscesses 
were reported. 
•  Gastrointestinal Perforation 
During  the  treatment  period,  one  patient  (0.6%)  in  the  CT  arm  and  3  patients  (1.7%)  in  the  CT+BV 
arm experienced Grade 2–5 GI perforations. 
- In the CT arm, one patient experienced Grade 5 peritonitis that occurred after 160 days on treatment 
and was assessed as possibly related to PLD chemotherapy treatment. 
-  In  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  4  intestinal  perforation  that  occurred  89  days 
after  start  of  treatment  and  was  assessed  as  probably  related  to  bevacizumab  and  unrelated  to 
topotecan; the event resolved. 
- In the CT+BV arm, one patient had a Grade 3 ileal perforation event that occurred 94 days after start 
of  treatment  and  was  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  bevacizumab  and  possibly  related  to  topotecan; 
the event was ongoing at the time of the clinical cutoff. This patient also experienced a Grade 3 arterial 
embolism event. 
-  In  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  had  a  non-serious  Grade  2  anal  fistula  event  that  was  assessed  as 
possibly  related  to  bevacizumab  and  unlikely  related  to  paclitaxel.  The  event  occurred  57  days  after 
start  of  treatment  and  as of  the  clinical  cutoff,  the  event  was  resolved.  In  addition,  one  patient  in  the 
CT+BV  arm  developed  a  Grade  4  GI  perforation  that  occurred  >  30  days  after  the  last  doses  of 
paclitaxel  and  bevacizumab;  the  event  occurred  349  days  after  start  of  treatment  and  after 
documentation  of  PD  and  >  30  days  after  start  of  treatment  with  doxorubicin.  The  investigator 
assessed  the  event  as  related  to  bevacizumab  and  unrelated  to  paclitaxel,  and  additional  data 
indicated that other possible etiological factor for the event included ovarian cancer. 
•  Hypertension (HTN) 
Grade  3–5  HTN  events  were  reported  in  1.1%  of  patients  in  the  CT  arm  and  7.8%  of  patients  in  the 
CT+BV arm. In the CT arm, 2 patients experienced Grade 3 HTN events. 
In  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  event  of  increased  blood  pressure  and  12 
patients  experienced  Grade  3  HTN  events.  In  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  experienced  a  Grade  4 
hypertensive crisis that occurred 71 days after treatment start and was assessed as probably related to 
bevacizumab and unrelated to PLD treatment; the event resolved. 
•  Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 
In  the  CT  arm,  Grade  3  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  adverse  events  were  reported  in  5  patients 
(2.8%) all of whom were in the paclitaxel chemotherapy cohort. In the CT+BV arm, Grade 3 peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  adverse  events  were  reported  in  8  patients  (4.5%);  7  of  whom  were  in  the 
paclitaxel chemotherapy cohort and one patient who was in the PLD chemotherapy cohort 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014 
Page 39/57 
 
 
 
 
In all  but one  patient, the adverse  event  was  considered  possibly or probably related  to chemotherapy 
treatment.  In  all  cases,  bevacizumab  treatment  was  considered  unrelated  or  unlikely.  As  of  the  clinical 
cutoff, 7  patients  (2  patients  in  the  CT  arm  and  5  patients  in  the  CT+BV  arm)  had  peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy  events  ongoing.  No  patient  in  either  arm  experienced  Grade  4  or  Grade  5  peripheral 
sensory neuropathy events. 
•  Proteinuria 
Grade 3–5 proteinuria events were reported in no patients in the CT arm and 4 patients (2.2%) in the 
CT+BV  arm.  Of  the  4  patients  in  the  CT+BV  arm,  one  patient  (0.6%)  developed  Grade  4  nephrotic 
syndrome that occurred 71 days after start of treatment, was assessed by the investigator as probably 
related  to  bevacizumab  and  unlikely  related  to  PLD,  and  resolved.  The  3  other  patients  experienced 
Grade 3 proteinuria events. No patient experienced Grade 5 proteinuria. 
•  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy 
Syndrome/Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
No  patient  in  the  CT  arm  and  one  patient  (0.6%)  in  the  CT+BV  arm  experienced  PRES/RPLS.  One 
patient  experienced  Grade  3  PRES/RPLS  on  Study  Day  58  that  resolved  without  sequelae  and  was 
considered possibly related to bevacizumab treatment. 
•  Venous Thromboembolic Events 
Grade 3–5 VTEs were reported in 7 patients (3.9%) in the CT arm and 6 patients (3.4%) in the CT+BV 
arm.  In  the  CT  arm,  one  patient  experienced  Grade  3  deep  vein  thrombosis,  5  patients  experienced 
Grade  4  pulmonary embolism,  and  one  patient  developed  a  Grade  4  venous  embolism.  In  the  CT+BV 
arm,  two  patients  experienced  Grade  3  venous  embolism,  one  patient  had  Grade  3  pulmonary 
embolism,  one  patient  had  Grade  3  venous  thrombosis,  and  two  patients  experienced  Grade  4 
pulmonary embolism. No patients experienced Grade 5 VTEs. 
•  Wound Healing Complication 
Grade  3–5  wound  healing  complication  events  were  reported  in  2  patients  (1.1%)  in  the  CT+BV  arm. 
One  patient  developed  a  Grade  3  catheter  site  necrosis  and  one  patient  developed  a  Grade  3 
postoperative  wound  infection.  No  patients  in  the  CT  arm  experienced  any  wound  healing  complication 
events. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of the data cut-off date (25 January 2013), a total of 136 patients (74.7%) in the CT arm and 128 
patients (71.5%) in the CT+BV arm had died (Table 22). The majority of these deaths were due to 
ovarian cancer and disease progression; 130 patients (71.4%) in the CT arm died due to ovarian 
cancer and disease progression compared with 119 patients (66.5%) in the CT+BV arm. 
A total of 15 patients (6 in the CT arm and 9 in the CT+BV arm) died due to adverse events, which 
occurred at any point during the study-follow-up period and these included the treatment-emergent 
Grade 5 adverse events reported up to safety follow-up.

Serious Adverse Events that Occurred in ≥  2% of Patients in Either Treatment Arm 
Grade 2–5 serious adverse events that occurred in ≥  2% of patients in either treatment arm were 
vomiting (CT: 3.9% versus CT+BV: 0), subileus (CT: 3.3% versus CT+BV: 2.2%), abdominal pain (CT: 
2.8% versus CT+BV: 2.2%), dyspnea (CT: 2.8% versus CT+BV: 2.2%), pulmonary embolism (CT: 
2.8% versus CT+BV: 1.1%), ileus (CT: 1.1% versus CT+BV: 2.2%), and HTN (CT: 0 versus CT+BV: 
2.2%). 
In the CT arm, vomiting occurred with an incidence ≥2% compared with the CT+BV arm, and in the 
CT+BV arm, HTN occurred with an incidence ≥2% compared with the CT arm. 
Laboratory findings 
No laboratory findings data were submitted by the MAH. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Age group 
The majority of patients were <65 years old (65.4% CT and 60.9% CT+BV). Consistent with the 
overall study population, in both age subgroups, the majority of patients in both treatment arms 
(85.7% to 91.4%) experienced at least one Grade 2–5 adverse event. Consistent with the overall 
study population, Grade 2–5 adverse events with a 10% difference in incidence between the CT arm 
and the CT+BV arm were HTN (< 65 years: 1.7% versus 12.8%; ≥   65 years: 12.7% versus 28.6%), 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (< 65 years: 8.5% versus 13.8%; ≥   65 years: 4.8% versus 24.3%), 
and proteinuria (< 65 years: 0 versus 10.1%; ≥   65 years: 1.6% versus 15.7%; see Table 16). 
Certain other adverse events had a higher incidence in the CT+BV arm in those ≥   65 years. 
Comparing  the rates of adverse events within the CT+BV arm only for the < 65 versus ≥   65 years 
subgroups, the  rates of Grade 3 adverse events were 45% and 45.7%, the rates of Grade 4 adverse 
events were 
9.2% and 12.9%, and the rates of Grade 5 events were 1.8% (2 patients) and 5.7% (4 patients). The 
adverse events with a 5% difference in incidence difference in the CT+BV arm for the subgroup < 65 
versus ≥   65 years include: fatigue (< 65 years: 22.0% versus ≥   65 years: 35.7%); mucosal 
inflammation (< 65 years: 10.1% versus ≥   65 years: 17.1%); peripheral sensory neuropathy (< 65 
years: 13.8% versus ≥   65 years: 24.3%); alopecia (< 65 years: 4.6% versus ≥   65 years: 14.3%); 
proteinuria (< 65 years: 10.1% versus ≥   65 years: 15.7%); and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(<  65 years: 9.2% versus ≥   65 years: 12.9%). 
Extrinsic factors 
Chemotherapy cohort 
The number of patients in each chemotherapy cohort was similar among treatment arms (55 CT and 
60 CT+BV received paclitaxel; 63 CT and 62 CT+BV received PLD, and 63 CT and 57 CT+BV received 
topotecan). 
The incidence of Grade 2–5 adverse events was 90.9% CT and 95.0% CT+BV for paclitaxel, 85.7% CT 
and 90.3% CT+BV for PLD, and 85.7% CT and 87.7% CT+BV for topotecan. Of note, Grade 2–5 
adverse events of peripheral sensory neuropathy (12 patients [21.8%] in the CT arm versus 22 
patients [36.7%] in the CT+BV arm) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (8 patients 
Avastin  Assessment  report 
EMA/CHMP/347790/2014 
Page 43/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[12.7%] in the CT arm versus 17 patients [27.4%] in the CT+BV arm) were reported with a higher 
incidence for the paclitaxel and PLD chemotherapy-containing regimens, respectively. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A higher percentage of patients in the CT+BV arm (43.6%) than in the CT arm (8.8%) experienced 
Grade 2–5 adverse events that led to withdrawal of study treatment with chemotherapy or 
bevacizumab. 
The most common (i.e.≥ 2% of patients in either arm) Grade 2–5 adverse events that led to study 
treatment discontinuation were  (in decreasing order of frequency in the CT+BV arm); peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (CT: 1.7% versus CT+BV: 4.5%), palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome 
(CT: 0.6% versus CT+BV: 3.4%), fatigue (CT: 0 versus CT+BV: 3.4%), HTN (CT: 0 versus CT+BV: 
2.8%), neutropenia (CT: 0 versus CT+BV: 2.2%) and proteinuria (CT: 0% versus CT+BV: 2.2%). 
Post marketing experience 
The  post–marketing  experience  with  bevacizumab  is  based  on  safety  data  contained  in  nine  Periodic 
Safety  Update  Reports  (PSURs)  covering  the  period  from  February  26,  2004,  to  February  25,  2012. 
The  total  number  of  patients  exposed  to  bevacizumab  in  the  post-marketing  setting  or  in  clinical  trials 
in this 8-year period covered by the PSURs is estimated to be approximately 1,339,560 patients. 
In the last reporting period (Feb-2011 to Feb-2012), a total of 11131 adverse events were reported, of 
which  9420  were  serious.  During  the  8-year  period  from  26  February  2004  to  25  February  2012,  a 
total  of  53,586  AEs,  of  which 44,427  were  serious,  were  reported  in  28,252  patients  (2.1%).  In  3411 
cases (0.3%), the outcome was fatal. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall,  there  are  more  AEs  in  the  CT+Bv  arm,  which  is  expected.  Major  differences  are  seen  with 
regard  to  hypertension,  PPES,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  infections  and  infestations,  and 
subcutaneous  disorders.  Higher  event  rates  are  observed  for  the  following  AEs:  fatigue,  mucosal 
inflammation,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  alopecia,  proteinuria,  PPES,  infections  and  hypertension. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect it. 
As  expected  from  previous  bevacizumab  studies,  the  majority  of  patients  experienced  one  or  more  AE 
of  any  grade,  but,  as  grade  1  AEs  are  not  collected  in  this  study,  the  exact  incidence  is  not  known. 
However,  a  total  of  91.1%  in  the  CT+BV  arm  and  87.3%  in  the  CT  arm  and  experienced  Grade 2–5 
adverse  events,  and  for  grade  3-5  the  reported  frequencies  were  59.2%  and  53.0%,  respectively.  The 
total  incidence  of  Grade  2–5  serious  AEs  (SAEs)  was  31.3%  in  the  CT+BV  arm  compared  with  27.1% 
in the CT arm. For Grade 3–5 SAEs the incidences were 24.6% and 19.3%, respectively. Regarding the 
individual  chemotherapy  cohorts,  the  incidence  of  Grade  2–5  SAEs  was  20.0%  CT  and  28.3%  CT+BV 
for  paclitaxel,  30.2%  CT  and  37.1%  CT+BV  for  PLD,  and  30.2%  CT  and  28.1%  CT+BV  for  topotecan. 
Only  Grade  2-5  AEs  in  at  least  10%  of  patients  in  any  treatment  group  between  CT  cohorts  were 
presented. These data showed some striking differences, which is reflected briefly in the SmPC.

There  is  a  considerable  difference  in  the  rate  of  discontinuations  between  the  two  treatment  arms, 
which could  be  explained  by  the  higher exposure  to  study treatment  in the  CT+Bv  arm.  However,  this 
is  a  well-known  pattern  that  is  seen  when  bevacizumab  combined  with  different  chemotherapies.  The 
majority of discontinuations in the CT+Bv arm are due to Grade 2 and 3 events. The main AEs leading 
to  discontinuation  are  neutropenia,  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
fatigue,  neuropathy,  pulmonary 
embolism,  PPES,  and  hypertension.  The  proportion  of  patients  (43.6%)  that  discontinue  treatment  in 
the  CT+Bv  arm  is  high,  and  the  proportion  of  discontinued  patients  with  unresolved  AEs  (18.4%)  is 
also  high.  However,  it  should  also  be  mentioned  that  no  new  safety  signals  were  observed.  More 
importantly,  time  from  discontinuation  of  chemotherapy  (due  to  AEs)  to  a  PFS  event  was  comparable 
between the CT arm and the CT + BV arm (median time CT: 4.0 months, CT+BV: 3.9 months). 
The  median  time  from  discontinuation  of  any  study  treatment  (due  to  AEs)  to  PFS  event  was  4.0 
months in the CT arm versus 3.2 months in the CT + BV arm. The MAH stated that the median time of 
3.2  months  between  study  treatment  discontinuation  and  PFS  event  should  be  considered  in  the 
context  of  longer  duration  treatment  in  CT  +  BV  arm  and  this  is  endorsed.  There  are  a  comparable 
number of Grade 5 AEs, and with regard to AESI, the most striking difference is seen in the number of 
hypertension,  fistula  or  abscess,  and  proteinuria.  The  majority  of  events  resolved  with  or  without 
sequelae.  In  general,  the  number  of  events  is  low,  and  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  However, 
all these AESI are adequately addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There  are  no  safety  concern  with  regard  to  deaths  and  SAEs.  Overall,  the  difference  of  SAEs  is 
acceptable  and  in  most  SOCs  the  numbers  are  small  and  comparable,  except  for  vomiting  and 
hypertension. 
In  patients  ≥65  years  there  was  a  difference  with  regard  to  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy, 
proteinuria,  mucosal  inflammation,  infections,  and  Palmar-Plantar  Erythrodysaesthesia  Syndrome 
(PPES). The SmPC has been updated to reflect it. 
A  review  of  Grade  2-5  AEs  by  chemotherapy revealed  that  the  Paclitaxel+Bv  cohort  had  slightly  more 
AEs, while the Topotecan+Bv cohort seems to have a better safety profile than the two other cohorts. 
It  is  of  concern  that  the  integrated  safety  analysis could  potentially  mask  higher  toxicity  of one  of  the 
chemotherapy-bevacizumab  combinations,  especially  since  more  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  PLD 
cohort.  However,  tables  of  grade  2-5  AEs  by  chemotherapy  cohort  showed  that  among  the  three 
chemotherapy cohorts,  the  paclitaxel  cohort  had  the highest  discontinuation rate  because  of  Grade  2-5 
AEs. The discontinuation rates in the PLD and topotecan cohorts were similar. The only Grade 2-5 SAEs 
that  occurred  with  a  ≥ 5%  incidence  difference  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  the  paclitaxel 
cohort  was  pyrexia.  No  single  Grade  2-5  SAE  occurred  with  a  ≥ 5%  incidence  difference  between  the 
two treatment arms in the PLD and topotecan cohorts. 
In the pivotal study, patients with a history of bowel obstruction were excluded, which is accepted. It is 
however  unclear  if  patients  who  previously  experienced  bowel  resection  as  part    of    their    initial 
debulking  surgery have  a  higher  risk  for  GI  perforations  and  fistulae.  However,  the  details of the  prior 
debulking  surgery  were  not  collected  in  this  study.  Therefore,  if  patients  who  previously  experienced 
bowel  resection  as  part  of  their  initial  debulking  surgery  have  a  higher  risk  for  GI  perforations  and 
fistulae  is  not  known  at  the  time  being.  The  current  wording  in  the  SmPC  (sections  4.4  and  4.8) 
addresses this issue. 
Finally,  the  MAH  didn’t  collect  laboratory  findings  with  the  argument  that  these  were  performed  by 
local  laboratories  according  to  local  standards.  This  is  of  concern,  as  the  combination  of  PLD  and 
topotecan  with  bevacizumab  has  not  been  previously  analysed  in  Phase  III  studies  in  ovarian  cancer. 
However,  according  to  the  protocol,  laboratory  tests  should  be  performed  as  per  local  standards  and 
were only reported on the Adverse Events pages in the eCRF if the laboratory test results ≥ Grade 2, or 
Avastin  Assessment  report

fell outside of the laboratory reference range and met the clinical significance criteria (i.e. accompanied 
by  clinical  symptoms,  leading  to  a  change  in  study  medication  and/or  requiring  a  change  in 
concomitant therapy). This is reassuring. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  was  overall  in  line  with  the  extensive  experience  with  bevacizumab  across  multiple 
oncology  indications.  No  unexpected  safety  signals  were  seen  in  this  study.  The  combination  of 
bevacizumab and PLD/topotecan/paclitaxel leads to more AEs, but this is also due to a higher exposure 
to  study  treatment  in  the  CT+Bv  arm.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  CT+Bv  is  acceptable  taking  into 
consideration the nature of the disease. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 14.2, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for bevacizumab (Avastin) in the treatment of adult 
patients with recurrence of platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens in combination with paclitaxel, 
topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Routine. 
EU SPC section 4.4: 
Patients treated with Avastin have an increased risk of 
haemorrhage, especially tumour-associated 
haemorrhage. Avastin should be discontinued 
permanently in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 
bleeding during Avastin therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see 
section 4.8). 
Patients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely 
excluded from clinical trials with Avastin, based on 
imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, 
the risk of CNS haemorrhage in such patients has not 
been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical 
trials (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored 
for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Avastin 
treatment discontinued in cases of intracranial bleeding. 
There is no information on the safety profile of Avastin 
in patients with congenital bleeding diathesis, acquired 
coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of 
anticoagulants for the treatment of thromboembolism 
prior to starting Avastin treatment, as such patients 
were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, caution 
should be exercised before initiating therapy in these 
patients. However, patients who developed venous 
thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to 
have an increased rate of Grade 3 or above bleeding 
when treated with a full dose of warfarin and Avastin 
concomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3).

Avastin. 
EU SPC section 4.4: 
Patients with a history of hypertension may be at 
increased risk for the development of proteinuria when 
treated with Avastin. There is evidence suggesting that 
all Grade (US National Cancer Institute-Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE 
(version 3.0)]) proteinuria may be related to the dose. 
Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is 
recommended prior to starting and during therapy. 
Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients 
who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) 
(NCI-CTCAE v.3).

EU SPC section 4.4: 
In clinical trials, the incidence of arterial 
thromboembolic reactions including cerebrovascular 
accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) 
and myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in patients 
receiving Avastin in combination with chemotherapy 
compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. 
Patients receiving Avastin plus chemotherapy, with a 
history of arterial thromboembolism or age greater than 
65 years have an increased risk of developing arterial 
thromboembolic reactionsduring therapy. Caution 
should be taken when treating these patients with 
Avastin. 
Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients 
who develop arterial thromboembolic reactions. 
Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC. 
EU SPC section 4.4: 
An increased incidence of hypertension was observed in 
Avastin-treated patients. Clinical safety data suggest 
that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose- 
dependent. Pre existing hypertension should be 
adequately controlled before starting Avastin treatment. 
There is no information on the effect of Avastin in 
patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of 
initiating therapy. Monitoring of blood pressure is 
generally recommended during therapy. 
In most cases hypertension was controlled adequately 
using standard antihypertensive treatment appropriate 
for the individual situation of the affected patient. The 
use of diuretics to manage hypertension is not advised 
in patients who receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
regimen. Avastin should be permanently discontinued if 
medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately 
controlled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the 
patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive 
encephalopathy.

Most of the patients who experienced CHF had 
metastatic breast cancer and had received previous 
treatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the 
left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF were 
present. 
In patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with 
anthracyclines and who had not received anthracyclines 
before, no increased incidence of all Grade CHF was 
observed in the anthracycline + bevacizumab group 
compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. 
CHF Grade 3 or higher reactions were somewhat more 
frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy than in patients 
receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with 
results in patients in other studies of metastatic breast 
cancer who did not receive concurrent anthracycline 
treatment (NCI-CTCAE v.3).

3.  Benefit- Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
There is a statistically significant and clinically relevant PFS result that is considered highly valuable in 
a  patient  population,  where  life-expectancy  is  short  and  few  effective  treatments  are  available.  The 
primary  analysis  is  supported  by  several  sensitivity  tests,  and  subgroup  analyses  showed  a  consistent 
effect  in  favour  of  CT+Bv  in  almost  all  subgroups.  Most  importantly  PFS  by  IRC  supports  the  PFS  by 
INV, however this is most pronounced in the paclitaxel cohort. 
The PFS results are  further supported by the key secondary endpoints ORR and duration of objective 
response where a significant difference in favour of CT+Bv is observed. 
Subgroup  analyses  of  both  PFS  and  OS,  indicated  that  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  CT  in  patients 
that  have  received  prior  anti-angiogenic  therapy,  may  lead  to  no  effect  with  regard  to  PFS  and  a 
detrimental  effect  with  regard  to  OS.  This  could  mean  that  the  effect  of  prior  anti-angiogenic  therapy 
may  induce  resistance  to  anti-angiogenic  therapies  in  later  disease  stages.  The  indication  has  been 
revised to address this.

In  terms  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  OS,  the  results  showed  no  detrimental  effect.  However, 
looking  at  the  different  cohorts  there  seems  to  be  some  differences  between  them.  The  OS  results 
have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the fact that the outcome in the three 
chemotherapy cohorts is not the same. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no uncertainties in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There is a high discontinuation rate in the CT+Bv arm due to AEs, which is expected and mainly due to 
longer exposure to study treatment in the CT+Bv arm. No new safety signals have been observed. The 
main  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  are  neutropenia,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  fatigue,  neuropathy, 
pulmonary embolism, PPES, and hypertension. 
As  expected  from  previous  bevacizumab  studies,  the  majority  of  patients  experienced  one  or  more  AE 
of  any  grade,  but,  as  grade  1  AEs  are  not  collected  in  this  study,  the  exact  incidence  is  not  known. 
However,  a  total  of  91.1%  in  the  CT+BV  arm  and  87.3%  in  the  CT  arm  and  experienced  Grade 2–5 
adverse events, and for grade 3-5 the reported frequencies were 59.2% and 53.0%, respectively. 
The  total  incidence  of  Grade  2–5  serious  AEs  (SAEs)  was  31.3%  in  the  CT+BV  arm  compared  with 
27.1% in the CT arm. For Grade 3–5 SAEs the incidences were 24.6% and 19.3%, respectively. 
Regarding  the  individual  chemotherapy  cohorts,  the  incidence  of  Grade  2–5  SAEs  was  20.0%  CT  and 
28.3%  CT+BV  for  paclitaxel, 30.2%  CT and  37.1% CT+BV  for  PLD,  and  30.2%  CT and  28.1%  CT+BV 
for  topotecan.  Only  Grade  2-5  AEs  in  at  least  10%  of  patients  in  any  treatment  group  between  CT 
cohorts  were  presented.  These  data  showed  some  striking  differences,  which  is  reflected  briefly  in  the 
SmPC. 
A  higher  incidence  of  certain  AEs  has  been  observed  in  patients  ≥  65  years  (peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy,  proteinuria,  mucosal  inflammation,  infections,  and  Palmar-Plantar  Erythrodysaesthesia 
Syndrome  (PPES)). The  large  increase  (12%) in serious toxicity in elderly population is of concern and 
this is addressed in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal study, patients with a history of bowel obstruction were excluded, which is accepted. It is 
however  unclear  if  patients  who  previously  experienced  bowel  resection  as  part    of    their    initial 
debulking  surgery have  a  higher risk for GI  perforations  and  fistulae.  However,  the  details of the  prior 
debulking  surgery  were  not  collected  in  this  study.  Therefore,  if  patients  who  previously  experienced 
bowel  resection  as  part  of  their  initial  debulking  surgery  have  a  higher  risk  for  GI  perforations  and 
fistulae  is  not  known  at  the  time  being.  The  current  wording  in  the  SmPC  (sections  4.4  and  4.8) 
addresses this issue.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In  a  patient  population  with  platinum-resistant  disease,  there  are  few  effective  treatment  options. 
Thus,  a  delay  of  disease  progression  in  terms  of  a  favourable  PFS  estimate  is  of  high  importance  for 
both patients and clinicians. 
A total of 91.1% in the CT+BV arm and  87.3% patients in the CT arm experienced Grade 2–5 adverse 
events, and for grade 3-5 the reported frequencies were 59.2% and 53.0%, respectively. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with CT in the treatment of patients with platinum- 
resistant ovarian cancer has been demonstrated. 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  CT  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
platinum-resistant  ovarian  cancer  is  considered  positive.  Delaying  progression  of  disease  is  of  high 
importance  to  a  population  with  a  poor  prognosis  and  few therapeutic  options.  Overall, the  robust  and 
clinically  relevant  PFS  effects  with  no  detrimental  effect  on  OS  outweigh  the  risks  of  adding 
bevacizumab to CT. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation requested 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Type 
II 
Extension of Indication to include Avastin in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior 
chemotherapy regimens and who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF 
inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Avastin is not similar to Yondelis within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1.

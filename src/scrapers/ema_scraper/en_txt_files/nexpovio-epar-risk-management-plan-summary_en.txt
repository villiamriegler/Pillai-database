Summary of risk management plan for NEXPOVIO (selinexor) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  NEXPOVIO.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of NEXPOVIO, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about NEXPOVIO 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
NEXPOVIO 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how NEXPOVIO should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for NEXPOVIO should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of NEXPOVIO 
's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
NEXPOVIO is authorised in combination  with dexamethasone, for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is 
refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-
CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy 
(see SmPC for the full indication). NEXPOVIO is indicated in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least one prior therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains selinexor as the active 
substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of NEXPOVIO’s benefits can be found in NEXPOVIO’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nexpovio 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks
Important risks of NEXPOVIO, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about NEXPOVIO 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR (Periodic Safety Update Report) assessment - so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of NEXPOVIO which is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of NEXPOVIO are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of NEXPOVIO. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Thrombocytopenia was experienced frequently by 
patients in the target population in clinical trials. 
Almost half of the patients with events in completed 
trials had thrombocytopenia of Grade ≥3 intensity and 
one patient died from bleeding due to 
thrombocytopenia considered possibly related to 
selinexor treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Assessment of the contribution of selinexor to the 
development of thrombocytopenia in the patients 
under study was influenced by multiple confounding 
variables including baseline thrombocytopenia, bone 
marrow cellularity and replacement with malignant 
plasma cells, disease indication, patient age, previous 
treatments, advanced disease, current comorbidities, 
concomitant medications and the complexity of the 
patient populations studied. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC sections 
4.2, 4.8, PIL sections 2 and 4 
Legal status: restricted medical prescription 
Additional risk minimisation measures: none 
Important identified risk: Severe infections due to Neutropenia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Adverse events of neutropenia were experienced 
frequently by patients in the target population in 
clinical trials. About 30% of the patients had 
neutropenia at some point of treatment and most 
instances were Grade 3 events. Neutropenia 
considered related to selinexor treatment was reported 
for about a quarter of the patients. About 15% of 
patients with neutropenia had ≥ grade 3 infections 
related events. 
Main risk factors for the development of neutropenia 
in cancer patients are age, poor performance status, 
advanced disease, certain comorbidities (renal 
impairment, hepatic impairment, cardiovascular 
disease), low baseline blood cell counts, low body 
surface area/body mass index, treatment with 
myelosuppressive chemotherapies, and specific 
genetic polymorphisms. Neutropenia can increase 
the risk of infections in these heavily pre-treated 
patients with underlying hematological malignancy. 
Infections are common in patients with advanced 
hematological malignancies due to the underlying 
cytopenia secondary to malignancy, various anti-
neoplastic treatments, advanced age and associated 
co-morbidities.

Important identified risk: Fatigue 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Fatigue was experienced frequently by patients in the 
target population in clinical trials. About 60% of the 
patients had fatigue at some point of treatment; about 
15% of the patients had Grade 3 events. Fatigue 
considered related to selinexor treatment was reported 
for about a 50% of the patients. 
Risk factors for fatigue include the underlying MM, 
systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anaemia, pain, 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, and medications for 
anxiety and pain, including narcotics, antiemetics 
(e.g., many D2-antagonists), and antidepressants. 
Importantly in myeloma, long-term use of 
glucocorticoids can also lead to significant fatigue 
because of the effects of acute steroid withdrawal that 
occurs 24-48 hours after glucocorticoid dosing.

Important identified risk: Decreased appetite 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Decreased appetite was experienced frequently by 
patients in the target population in clinical and non- 
clinical trials. About 50% of the patients in the HM- 
Pool reported decreased appetite at some point of 
treatment; about 7 % of the patients had Grade 3 
events. Decreased appetite considered related to 
selinexor treatment was reported for about half of the 
patients. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Decreased appetite/anorexia is well characterized in 
patients with advanced cancer. Decreased appetite 
(anorexia) in cancer patients is typically associated 
with, and exacerbated by, the underlying disease and 
prior therapies. Risk factors include nausea, fatigue, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, and dysgeusia.

Important identified risk: Weight decreased 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Weight loss was experienced frequently by patients in 
the target population in clinical and non-clinical trials. 
About 30% of the patients in the HM-Pool reported 
weight loss at some point of treatment; about 2% of 
the patients had Grade 3 events. Weight loss 
considered related to selinexor treatment was reported 
for 28% of the patients. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
In the HM-Pool, 589 (62.2%) patients had a decrease 
in body weight of ≥5% from baseline, 266 (28.1%) 
patients had a ≥10% decrease from baseline, and 20 
(2.1%) patients had a ≥20% decrease. 
Weight loss is well characterized in patients with 
advanced cancer and is typically associated with, and 
exacerbated by, the underlying disease and prior 
therapies. Risk factors include nausea, fatigue, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, and dysgeusia.

Important identified risk: Hyponatraemia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Events indicative of hyponatraemia, typically 
asymptomatic, were experienced frequently by 
patients in the target population in clinical trials. 
About 29% of the patients in the HM-Pool reported 
associated events at some point of treatment; about 
16% of the patients had Grade ≥3 events. Grade ≥3 
events considered related to selinexor treatment were 
reported for 12% of the patients. 
Risk factors for hyponatraemia include 
chemotherapy, treatment-induced nausea and 
vomiting, hydration, pain, narcotic drugs, and 
physical and emotional stress. Chronic diseases like 
cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
diabetes and severe kidney disease, low body weight, 
old age, and previous episodes of hyponatraemia are 
further risk factors.

Important identified risk: Confusional state  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Events indicative of confusion were experienced 
frequently by patients in the target population in 
clinical trials. About 12% of the patients in the HM-
Pool reported events of confusion at some point of 
treatment; about 3% of the patients had Grade 
≥3 events. Grade ≥3 events considered related to 
selinexor treatment were reported for about 2% of the 
patients.  
Confusion in the setting of selinexor administration is 
usually multifactorial in origin, often occurring in the 
context of multiple, concurrent events, including 
dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, 
diarrhoea, infection, concomitant medications, other 
comorbidities and/or high tumor burden. Confusional 
state is a frequent neurocognitive complication in 
patients with cancer, particularly in patients with 
advanced disease in whom a combination of factors 
may trigger an episode. Moreover, confusion is often 
reported in patients with a high degree of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predisposing vulnerability, particularly in the elderly, 
as well as in patients with anaemia, diarrhoea, 
dehydration, infections, systemic organ failure, 
metabolic derangements (uraemia, hypercalcaemia, 
hyperviscosity, liver dysfunction), concomitant 
medications (particularly psychoactive drugs and 
steroids), polypharmacy, other comorbidities and/or 
high tumor burden. The patient populations treated 
with selinexor are therefore at considerable risk for 
the development of confusion and dizziness in the 
course of their disease.

Important potential risk: Tumor Lysis syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Although PTs of Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were 
uncommonly reported (3 patients reported with 
Grade 3 events), because TLS can be associated with 
significant morbidity and because there are direct 
implications for monitoring and management, TLS 
has been characterized as an important potential risk 
of selinexor. 
Reported events of TLS are often confounded by a 
variety of factors including renal failure due to 
progressive disease complicating the electrolyte 
profile, intrinsic tumor-related factors (such as tumor 
burden and tumor type), variable risk factors that 
predispose towards development of TLS 
(pretreatment hyperuricaemia, preexisting 
nephropathy, independent of myeloma as well as 
those due to myeloma paraproteins) and concomitant 
use of pomalidomide and dexamethasone, which are 
associated with TLS.

Important potential risk: Acute cerebellar syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Three cases of ACS related events were reported in 
Selinexor development program in >3111 patients 
treated of March 31, 2019. One (1) case has occurred 
in an adult patient with heavily pretreated, relapsed 
pancreatic cancer and baseline cerebellar 
abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
who was treated with selinexor 145 mg twice weekly 
(i.e., a very high dose which is no longer used); 2 
cases occurred in pediatric patients with refractory 
AML, also with baseline cerebellar abnormalities 
and treated at very high doses no longer used. No 
new reports were identified since these cases 
were reported and further study of higher doses was 
discontinued.  No cases of ACS have occurred in 
adult patients with MM or other hematologic 
malignancies.  Because ACS can be associated with 
significant morbidity and there are direct 
implications for monitoring and management, ACS 
has been characterized as an important potential risk 
of selinexor. 
Reported events of ACS are often confounded by a 
variety of factors including central nervous system 
disorders due to progressive disease complicating the 
electrolyte profile, intrinsic tumor-related factors, 
variable risk factors that predispose towards 
development of ACS and concomitant use of 
multiple medications, which are associated with 
ACS.

Important potential risk: Medication error 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Medication error (ME) overdose were reported in 3 
and 5 patients in HM-Pool and MM-Pool respectively. 
All events were low grade and resolved. A clear 
causal association cannot be established, ME has 
been recognized as an important potential risk of 
selinexor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Reported events of ME are confounded by age and 
concomitant use of several medications.

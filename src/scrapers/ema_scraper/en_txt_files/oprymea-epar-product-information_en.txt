CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, 
through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations 
of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “on off” fluctuations).
Oprymea is indicated in adults for symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless 
Legs Syndrome in doses up to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) (see section 4.2).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Parkinson’s disease
The daily dose is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.
Initial treatment
Doses should be increased gradually from a starting-dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per 
day and then increased every 5 - 7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable 
effects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg
of salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg 
(of salt) per day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment
The individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a 
maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, 
efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose 
adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In 
clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of 
salt). In advanced Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) 
per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is 
recommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the 
maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients (see section 4.5).
Treatment discontinuation
Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome or a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off 
at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg 
of base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of 
salt) per day (see section 4.4). Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome could still appear while 
tapering and a temporary increase of the dose could be necessary before resuming tapering (see 
section 4.4).
3
Renal impairment
The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is 
suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing 
frequency.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea 
should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a 
day (0.176 mg of base/0.25 mg of salt daily). A maximum daily dose of 1.57 mg pramipexole base 
(2.25 mg of salt) should not be exceeded.
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min, the daily dose of Oprymea should be 
administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily. A maximum daily 
dose of 1.1 mg pramipexole base (1.5 mg of salt) should not be exceeded.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy the Oprymea daily dose should be reduced by 
the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i.e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, 
then the Oprymea daily dose should be reduced by 30%. The daily dose can be administered in two 
divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/min, and as a single daily dose if 
creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min.
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of absorbed 
active substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic 
insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Oprymea in children below 18 years has not been established. There is no 
relevant use of Oprymea in the paediatric population for the indication of Parkinson’s Disease.
Restless Legs Syndrome
The recommended starting dose of Oprymea is 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) taken once daily 
2-3 hours before bedtime. For patients requiring additional symptomatic relief, the dose may be 
increased every 4-7 days to a maximum of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day (as shown in the 
table below).

Patient’s response should be evaluated after 3 months treatment and the need for treatment 
continuation should be reconsidered. If treatment is interrupted for more than a few days it should be 
re-initiated by dose titration carried out as above.
Treatment discontinuation
Since the daily dose for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome will not exceed 0.54 mg of base 
(0.75 mg of salt) Oprymea can be discontinued without tapering off. In a 26 week placebo controlled 
trial, rebound of RLS symptoms (worsening of symptom severity as compared to baseline) was 
4
observed in 10% of patients (14 out of 135) after abrupt discontinuation of treatment. This effect was 
found to be similar across all doses.
Renal impairment
The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. Patients with a creatinine clearance 
above 20 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose.
The use of pramipexole has not been studied in haemodialysis patients, or in patients with severe renal 
impairment.
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is not required, as approx. 90% of absorbed active 
substance is excreted through the kidneys.
Paediatric population
Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data 
on safety and efficacy.
Tourette Disorder
Paediatric population
Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years since the efficacy 
and safety has not been established in this population. Oprymea should not be used in children or 
adolescents with Tourette Disorder because of a negative benefit-risk balance for this disorder (see 
section 5.1).
Method of administration
The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without 
food.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’s disease with renal impairment a reduced 
dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients 
should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
Dyskinesia
In advanced Parkinson’s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur during 
the initial titration of Oprymea. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Dystonia 
Axial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has 
occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or incremental 
dose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease, the 
symptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia 
occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of 
pramipexole considered.
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without 
5
awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and 
advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea. 
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from 
driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dose or termination of therapy may be 
considered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking 
other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.5, 4.7 
and section 4.8).
Impulse control disorders
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including pramipexole. 
Dose reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Mania and delirium
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers 
should be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Patients with psychotic disorders
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential 
benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see 
section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
Severe cardiovascular disease
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood 
pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension
associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2).
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)
DAWS has been reported with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole (see section 4.8). To 
discontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see 
section 4.2). Limited data suggests that patients with impulse control disorders and those receiving 
high daily dose and/or high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists may be at higher risk for 
developing DAWS. Withdrawal symptoms may include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating 
and pain and do not respond to levodopa. Prior to tapering off and discontinuing pramipexole, patients 
should be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored during 
tapering and discontinuation. In case of severe and/or persistent withdrawal symptoms, temporary re-
administration of pramipexole at the lowest effective dose may be considered.
Augmentation
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome with dopaminergic 
medicinal products can result in augmentation. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms 
in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other 
extremities. Augmentation was specifically investigated in a controlled clinical trial over 26 weeks. 
Augmentation was observed in 11.8% of patients in the pramipexole group (N = 152) and 9.4% of 
patients in the placebo group (N = 149). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to augmentation showed no 
6
significant difference between pramipexole and placebo groups.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Plasma protein binding
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (<20%) extent, and little biotransformation is 
seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or 
elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by 
biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with 
anticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and 
levodopa.
Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by 
inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products 
that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as 
cimetidine,amantadine mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact with 
pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose should 
be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with Oprymea.
Combination with levodopa
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of levodopa is 
reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing 
the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating 
medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8).
Antipsychotic medicinal products
Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see 
section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). 
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. 
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the 
concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma. In the 
absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. However, if its use is 
unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole 
affected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, 
these studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
7
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put 
themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent 
episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on 
pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both 
groups. 63 % of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse 
drug reaction.
The majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even 
as therapy is continued.
Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of 
patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data .
Parkinson’s disease, most common adverse reactions
The most commonly (≥5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson’s disease more 
frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, 
dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of 
somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A 
more frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may 
occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.

patients with Parkinson’s Disease treated with pramipexole.
Restless Legs Syndrome, most common adverse reactions
The most commonly (≥ 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome
treated with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue. Nausea and fatigue were more 
often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, 
respectively).

patients with Restless Legs Syndrome treated with pramipexole.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Somnolence
10
Pramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with 
excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4).
Libido disorders
Pramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased).
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including Oprymea (see 
section 4.4).
In a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson’s 
disease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had 
symptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour 
(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included 
dopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age (≤ 65 years), not 
being married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome
Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including 
pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section 
4.4).
Cardiac failure
In clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with 
pramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased 
risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-
2.85).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse drug reactions would be 
those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, 
hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose 
of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent 
may be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with 
gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram 
monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05.
Mechanism of action
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily 
of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic 
activity.
11
Pramipexole alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the 
striatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and 
turnover.
The mechanism of action of pramipexole as treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown. 
Neuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.
Clinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson’s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson' s disease. Placebo-
controlled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages stages I – V
treated with pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received 
concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was 
maintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years 
there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole 
significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to 
initial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be 
balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean 
change in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally 
higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However there was no significant 
difference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating 
pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson´s disease.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pramipexole in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson’s Disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
Clinical efficacy and safety in Restless Legs Syndrome
The efficacy of pramipexole was evaluated in four placebo-controlled clinical trials in approximately 
1,000 patients with moderate to very severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome. 
The mean change from baseline in the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS) and the Clinical 
Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) were the primary efficacy outcome measures. For both 
primary endpoints statistically significant differences have been observed for the pramipexole dose 
groups 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 0.75 mg pramipexole salt in comparison to placebo. After 12 weeks of 
treatment the baseline IRLS score improved from 23.5 to 14.1 points for placebo and from 23.4 to 9.4 
points for pramipexole (doses combined). The adjusted mean difference was -4.3 points (CI 95% -6.4; 
-2.1 points, p-value <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (improved, very much improved) were 51.2% and 
72.0% for placebo and pramipexole, respectively (difference 20% CI 95%: 8.1%; 31.8%, p<0.0005). 
Efficacy was observed with 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) per day after the first week of 
treatment.
In a placebo-controlled polysomnography study over 3 weeks pramipexole significantly reduced the 
number of periodic limb movements during time in bed.
Longer term efficacy was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. After 26 weeks of treatment, 
there was an adjusted mean reduction in IRLS total score of 13.7 and 11.1 points in the pramipexole 
and placebo group, respectively, with a statistically significant (p = 0.008) mean treatment difference 
12
of -2.6. CGI-I responder rates (much improved, very much improved) were 50.3% (80/159) and 68.5% 
(111/162) for placebo and pramipexole, respectively (p = 0.001), corresponding to a number needed to 
treat (NNT) of 6 patients (95%CI: 3.5, 13.4).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pramipexole in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Restless Legs Syndrome (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
Clinical efficacy and safety in Tourette Disorder
The efficacy of pramipexole (0.0625-0.5 mg/day) with paediatric patients aged 6-17 years with 
Tourette Disorder was evaluated in a 6-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled flexible 
dose study. A total of 63 patients were randomised (43 on pramipexole, 20 on placebo). The primary 
endpoint was change from baseline on the Total Tic Score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity 
Scale (YGTSS). No difference was observed for pramipexole as compared to placebo for either the 
primary endpoint or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints including YGTSS total score, Patient 
Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), or 
Clinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S). Adverse events occurring in at least 5% of 
patients in the pramipexole group and more common in the pramipexole-treated patients than in 
patients on placebo were: headache (27.9%, placebo 25.0%), somnolence (7.0%, placebo 5.0%), 
nausea (18.6%, placebo 10.0%), vomiting (11.6%, placebo 0.0%), upper abdominal pain (7.0%, 
placebo 5.0%), orthostatic hypotension (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), myalgia (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), sleep 
disorder (7.0%, placebo 0.0%), dyspnoea (7.0%, placebo 0.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(7.0%, placebo 5.0%). Other significant adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication 
for patients receiving pramipexole were confusional state, speech disorder and aggravated condition 
(see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute 
bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 
hours. Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but 
the rate of absorption was reduced. Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient 
variation of plasma levels.
Distribution
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is 
large (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to 
plasma).
Biotransformation
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Elimination
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of 
14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total 
clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately 
400 ml/min. The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving 
the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
13
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency to 
a hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and 
rabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at 
maternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, 
the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
A delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. 
The relevance for humans is unknown.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell 
hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is 
not clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and 
higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not 
observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species 
investigated.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, 
through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations 
of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or "on off" fluctuations).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Oprymea prolonged-release tablets are a once-a-day oral formulation of pramipexole.
Initial treatment
Doses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day 
and then increased every 5 - 7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable 
effects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg 
of salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. 
However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 
1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.8).
Patients already taking Oprymea tablets may be switched to Oprymea prolonged-release tablets 
17
overnight, at the same daily dose. After switching to Oprymea prolonged-release tablets, the dose may 
be adjusted depending on the patient’s therapeutic response (see section 5.1).
Maintenance treatment
The individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a 
maximum of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, 
efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose 
adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In 
clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of
salt). In advanced Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) 
per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is 
recommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the
maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients (see section 4.5).
Missed dose
When the intake of a dose is missed, Oprymea prolonged-release tablets should be taken within 12 
hours after the regularly scheduled time. After 12 hours, the missed dose should be left out and the 
next dose should be taken on the following day at the next regularly scheduled time.
Treatment discontinuation
Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome or a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off 
at a rate of 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.52 mg 
of base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) 
per day (see section 4.4). Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome could still appear while tapering 
and a temporary increase of the dose could be necessary before resuming tapering (see section 4.4).
Renal impairment
The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is 
suggested:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing 
frequency.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min, treatment should be started with 
0.26 mg Oprymea prolonged-release tablets every other day. Caution should be exercised and careful 
assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability should be made before increasing to daily dosing 
after one week. If a further dose increase is necessary, doses should be increased by 0.26 mg 
pramipexole base at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 1.57 mg pramipexole base (2.25 mg of 
salt) per day.
The treatment of patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min with Oprymea prolonged-
release tablets is not recommended as no data are available for this patient population. The use of 
Oprymea tablets should be considered.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy, the recommendations given above should be 
followed.
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of absorbed 
active substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic 
insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Oprymea in children below 18 years has not been established. There is no 
relevant use of Oprymea prolonged-release tablets in the paediatric population for the indication of 
Parkinson’s Disease.
18
Method of administration
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water, and must not be chewed, divided or crushed. The 
tablets may be taken either with or without food and should be taken each day at about the same time.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’s disease with renal impairment a reduced 
dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients 
should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
Dyskinesia
In advanced Parkinson’s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur during 
the initial titration of Oprymea. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Dystonia 
Axial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has 
occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or incremental 
dose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease, the 
symptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia 
occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of 
pramipexole considered.
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without 
awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and 
advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea. 
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from 
driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of therapy may be 
considered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking 
other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.5, 4.7 
and section 4.8).
Impulse control disorders
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including Oprymea. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Mania and delirium
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers 
should be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Patients with psychotic disorders
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential 
benefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole 
should be avoided (see section 4.5).
19
Ophthalmologic monitoring
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
Severe cardiovascular disease
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood 
pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension 
associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2).
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)
DAWS has been reported with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole (see section 4.8). To 
discontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see 
section 4.2). Limited data suggests that patients with impulse control disorders and those receiving 
high daily dose and/or high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists may be at higher risk for 
developing DAWS. Withdrawal symptoms may include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating 
and pain and do not respond to levodopa. Prior to tapering off and discontinuing pramipexole, patients 
should be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored during 
tapering and discontinuation. In case of severe and/or persistent withdrawal symptoms, temporary re-
administration of pramipexole at the lowest effective dose may be considered.
Remnants in stool 
Some patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact Oprymea 
prolonged-release tablets. If patients report such an observation, the physician should reassess 
patient’s response to therapy.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Plasma protein binding
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is 
seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or 
elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by 
biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with 
anticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and 
levodopa.
Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by 
inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products 
that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as 
cimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact 
with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose 
should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with Oprymea.
Combination with levodopa
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of levodopa is 
reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing 
the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating 
medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8).
Antipsychotic medicinal products
Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see 
20
section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). 
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. 
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the 
concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. However, if its use 
is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole 
affected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, 
these studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put 
themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent 
episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,778 Parkinson’s 
disease patients on pramipexole and 1,297 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently 
reported for both groups. 67% of patients on pramipexole and 54% of patients on placebo reported at 
least one adverse drug reaction.
The majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even 
as therapy is continued.
Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of 
patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The most commonly (≥ 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson’s disease more 
frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, 
dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of 
somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A 
more frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may 
occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.

1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience. With 95 % certainty, the 
frequency category is not greater than uncommon, but might be lower. A precise frequency 
estimation is not possible as the side effect did not occur in a clinical trial database of 2,762 
patients with Parkinson’s Disease treated with pramipexole.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Somnolence
Pramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with 
excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4).
Libido disorders
Pramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased).
Impulse control disorders
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including Oprymea (see 
section 4.4).
In a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson’s 
disease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had 
symptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include 
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour 
(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included 
dopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age (≤ 65 years), not 
being married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome
Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including 
pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section 
4.4).
Cardiac failure
In clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with 
pramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased 
risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-
2.85).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those 
related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, 
hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. 
Management
23
There is no established antidote for overdose of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system 
stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated. Management of the overdose may 
require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of 
activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05.
Mechanism of action
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily 
of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic 
activity.
Pramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the 
striatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and 
turnover.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed. In a clinical trial with 
healthy volunteers, where pramipexole prolonged-release tablets were titrated faster (every 3 days) 
than recommended up to 3.15 mg pramipexole base (4.5 mg of salt) per day, an increase in blood 
pressure and heart rate was observed. Such effect was not observed in patient studies.
Clinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson’s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Placebo-
controlled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – V treated 
with pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received 
concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was 
maintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years 
there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole 
significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to 
initial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be 
balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean 
change in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally 
higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant 
difference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating 
pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
The safety and efficacy of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets in the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of three randomised, 
controlled trials. Two trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease and one trial was 
conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.
Superiority of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks of 
treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts II+III score) and the key secondary (CGI-I and PGI-I 
responder rates) efficacy endpoints in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 539 
patients with early Parkinson’s disease. Maintenance of efficacy was shown in patients treated for 
33 weeks. Pramipexole prolonged-release tablets were non-inferior to pramipexole immediate release 
tablets as assessed on the UPDRS Parts II+III score at week 33.
24
In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 517 patients with advanced Parkinson’s 
disease who were on concomitant levodopa therapy superiority of pramipexole prolonged-release 
tablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks of treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts 
II+III score) and the key secondary (off-time) efficacy endpoints.
The efficacy and tolerability of an overnight switch from pramipexole tablets to pramipexole 
prolonged-release tablets at the same daily dose were evaluated in a double-blind clinical study in 
patients with early Parkinson’s disease.
Efficacy was maintained in 87 of 103 patients switched to pramipexole prolonged-release tablets. Out 
of these 87 patients, 82.8% did not change their dose, 13.8% increased and 3.4% decreased their dose.
In half of the 16 patients who did not meet the criterion for maintained efficacy on UPDRS Part II+III 
score, the change from baseline was considered not clinically relevant.
Only one patient switched to pramipexole prolonged-release tablets experienced a drug-related 
adverse event leading to withdrawal.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pramipexole in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson’s Disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Pramipexole is completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability is 
greater than 90%.
In a Phase I trial, where pramipexole immediate release and prolonged-release tablets were assessed in 
fasted state, the minimum and peak plasma concentration (Cmin, Cmax) and exposure (AUC) of the same 
daily dose of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets given once daily and pramipexole tablets given 
three times a day were equivalent.
The once daily administration of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets causes less frequent 
fluctuations in the pramipexole plasma concentration over 24 hours compared to the three times daily 
administration of pramipexole immediate release tablets.
The maximum plasma concentrations occur at about 6 hours after administration of pramipexole 
prolonged-release tablets once daily. Steady state of exposure is reached at the latest after 5 days of 
continuous dosing.
Concomitant administration with food does generally not affect the bioavailability of pramipexole. 
Intake of a high fat meal induced an increase in peak concentration (Cmax) of about 24% after a single 
dose administration and about 20% after multiple dose administrations and a delay of about 2 hours in 
time to reach peak concentration in healthy volunteers. Total exposure (AUC) was not affected by 
concomitant food intake. The increase in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. In the Phase III 
studies that established safety and efficacy of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets, patients were 
instructed to take study medication without regard to food intake.
While body weight has no impact on the AUC, it was found to influence the volume of distribution 
and therefore the peak concentrations Cmax. A decreased body weight by 30 kg results in an increase in 
Cmax of 45%. However, in Phase III trials in Parkinson’s disease patients no clinically meaningful 
influence of body weight on the therapeutic effect and tolerability of pramipexole prolonged-release 
tablets was detected.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
Distribution
25
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is 
large (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to 
plasma).
Biotransformation
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Elimination
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of 
14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total 
clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately 
400 ml/min. The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving 
the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency to 
a hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and 
rabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at 
maternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, 
the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
A delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. 
The relevance for humans is unknown.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell 
hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is 
not clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and 
higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not 
observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species 
investigated.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, 
through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations 
of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or "on off" fluctuations).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Oprymea prolonged-release tablets are a once-a-day oral formulation of pramipexole.
29
Initial treatment
Doses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day 
and then increased every 5 - 7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable 
effects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg 
of salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. 
However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 
1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.8).
Patients already taking Oprymea tablets may be switched to Oprymea prolonged-release tablets 
overnight, at the same daily dose. After switching to Oprymea prolonged-release tablets, the dose may 
be adjusted depending on the patient’s therapeutic response (see section 5.1).
Maintenance treatment
The individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a 
maximum of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, 
efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose 
adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In 
clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of 
salt). In advanced Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) 
per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is 
recommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the
maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients (see section 4.5).
Missed dose
When the intake of a dose is missed, Oprymea prolonged-release tablets should be taken within 12 
hours after the regularly scheduled time. After 12 hours, the missed dose should be left out and the 
next dose should be taken on the following day at the next regularly scheduled time.
Treatment discontinuation
Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome or a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off 
at a rate of 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.52 mg 
of base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) 
per day (see section 4.4). Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome could still appear while tapering 
and a temporary increase of the dose could be necessary before resuming tapering (see section 4.4).
Renal impairment
The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is 
suggested:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing 
frequency.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min, treatment should be started with 
0.26 mg Oprymea prolonged-release tablets every other day. Caution should be exercised and careful 
assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability should be made before increasing to daily dosing 
after one week. If a further dose increase is necessary, doses should be increased by 0.26 mg 
pramipexole base at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 1.57 mg pramipexole base (2.25 mg of 
salt) per day.
30
The treatment of patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min with Oprymea prolonged-
release tablets is not recommended as no data are available for this patient population. The use of 
Oprymea tablets should be considered.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy, the recommendations given above should be 
followed.
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of absorbed 
active substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic 
insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Oprymea in children below 18 years has not been established. There is no 
relevant use of Oprymea prolonged-release tablets in the paediatric population for the indication of 
Parkinson’s Disease.
Method of administration
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water, and must not be chewed, divided or crushed. The 
tablets may be taken either with or without food and should be taken each day at about the same time.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’s disease with renal impairment a reduced 
dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients 
should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
Dyskinesia
In advanced Parkinson’s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur during 
the initial titration of Oprymea. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Dystonia 
Axial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has 
occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or incremental 
dose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease, the 
symptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia 
occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of 
pramipexole considered.
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without 
awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and 
advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea. 
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from 
driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of therapy may be 
considered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking 
other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.5, 4.7 
and section 4.8).
31
Impulse control disorders
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including Oprymea. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Mania and delirium
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers 
should be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.
Patients with psychotic disorders
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential 
benefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole 
should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
Severe cardiovascular disease
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood 
pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension 
associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2).
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)
DAWS has been reported with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole (see section 4.8). To 
discontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see 
section 4.2). Limited data suggests that patients with impulse control disorders and those receiving 
high daily dose and/or high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists may be at higher risk for 
developing DAWS. Withdrawal symptoms may include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating 
and pain and do not respond to levodopa. Prior to tapering off and discontinuing pramipexole, patients 
should be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored during 
tapering and discontinuation. In case of severe and/or persistent withdrawal symptoms, temporary re-
administration of pramipexole at the lowest effective dose may be considered.
Remnants in stool 
Some patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact Oprymea 
prolonged-release tablets. If patients report such an observation, the physician should reassess 
patient’s response to therapy.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Plasma protein binding
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is 
seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or 
elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by 
biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with 
anticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and 
levodopa.
Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway
32
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by 
inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products 
that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as 
cimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact 
with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose 
should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with Oprymea.
Combination with levodopa
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of levodopa is 
reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing 
the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating 
medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8).
Antipsychotic medicinal products
Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see 
section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). 
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. 
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the 
concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. However, if its use 
is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole 
affected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, 
these studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put 
themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent 
episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,778 Parkinson’s 
disease patients on pramipexole and 1,297 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently 
reported for both groups. 67% of patients on pramipexole and 54% of patients on placebo reported at 
least one adverse drug reaction.
33
The majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even 
as therapy is continued.
Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of 
patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000);  not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The most commonly (≥ 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson’s disease more 
frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, 
dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of 
somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A 
more frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may 
occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.

1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience. With 95 % certainty, the 
frequency category is not greater than uncommon, but might be lower. A precise frequency 
estimation is not possible as the side effect did not occur in a clinical trial database of 2,762 
patients with Parkinson’s Disease treated with pramipexole.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Somnolence
Pramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with 
excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4).
Libido disorders
Pramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased).
Impulse control disorders
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including Oprymea (see 
section 4.4).
In a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson’s 
disease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had 
symptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include 
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour 
(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included 
dopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age (≤ 65 years), not 
being married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome
Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including 
pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section 
4.4).
Cardiac failure
In clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with 
pramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased 
risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-
2.85).
35
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those 
related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, 
hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. 
Management
There is no established antidote for overdose of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system 
stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated. Management of the overdose may 
require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of 
activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05.
Mechanism of action
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily 
of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic 
activity.
Pramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the 
striatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and 
turnover.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed. In a clinical trial with 
healthy volunteers, where pramipexole prolonged-release tablets were titrated faster (every 3 days) 
than recommended up to 3.15 mg pramipexole base (4.5 mg of salt) per day, an increase in blood 
pressure and heart rate was observed. Such effect was not observed in patient studies.
Clinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson’s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Placebo-
controlled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – V treated 
with pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received 
concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was 
maintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years 
there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole 
significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to 
initial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be 
balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean 
change in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally 
higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant 
36
difference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating 
pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
The safety and efficacy of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets in the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of three randomised, 
controlled trials. Two trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease and one trial was 
conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.
Superiority of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks of 
treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts II+III score) and the key secondary (CGI-I and PGI-I 
responder rates) efficacy endpoints in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 539 
patients with early Parkinson’s disease. Maintenance of efficacy was shown in patients treated for 
33 weeks. Pramipexole prolonged-release tablets were non-inferior to pramipexole immediate release 
tablets as assessed on the UPDRS Parts II+III score at week 33.
In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 517 patients with advanced Parkinson’s 
disease who were on concomitant levodopa therapy superiority of pramipexole prolonged-release 
tablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks of treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts 
II+III score) and the key secondary (off-time) efficacy endpoints.
The efficacy and tolerability of an overnight switch from pramipexole tablets to pramipexole 
prolonged-release tablets at the same daily dose were evaluated in a double-blind clinical study in 
patients with early Parkinson’s disease.
Efficacy was maintained in 87 of 103 patients switched to pramipexole prolonged-release tablets. Out 
of these 87 patients, 82.8% did not change their dose, 13.8% increased and 3.4% decreased their dose.
In half of the 16 patients who did not meet the criterion for maintained efficacy on UPDRS Part II+III 
score, the change from baseline was considered not clinically relevant.
Only one patient switched to pramipexole prolonged-release tablets experienced a drug-related 
adverse event leading to withdrawal.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pramipexole in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson’s Disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Pramipexole is completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability is 
greater than 90%.
In a Phase I trial, where pramipexole immediate release and prolonged-release tablets were assessed in 
fasted state, the minimum and peak plasma concentration (Cmin, Cmax) and exposure (AUC) of the same 
daily dose of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets given once daily and pramipexole tablets given 
three times a day were equivalent.
The once daily administration of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets causes less frequent 
fluctuations in the pramipexole plasma concentration over 24 hours compared to the three times daily 
administration of pramipexole immediate release tablets.
The maximum plasma concentrations occur at about 6 hours after administration of pramipexole 
prolonged-release tablets once daily. Steady state of exposure is reached at the latest after 5 days of 
continuous dosing.
Concomitant administration with food does generally not affect the bioavailability of pramipexole. 
Intake of a high fat meal induced an increase in peak concentration (Cmax) of about 24% after a single 
dose administration and about 20% after multiple dose administrations and a delay of about 2 hours in 
37
time to reach peak concentration in healthy volunteers. Total exposure (AUC) was not affected by 
concomitant food intake. The increase in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. In the Phase III 
studies that established safety and efficacy of pramipexole prolonged-release tablets, patients were 
instructed to take study medication without regard to food intake.
While body weight has no impact on the AUC, it was found to influence the volume of distribution 
and therefore the peak concentrations Cmax. A decreased body weight by 30 kg results in an increase in 
Cmax of 45%. However, in Phase III trials in Parkinson’s disease patients no clinically meaningful 
influence of body weight on the therapeutic effect and tolerability of pramipexole prolonged-release 
tablets was detected.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
Distribution
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is 
large (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to 
plasma).
Biotransformation
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Elimination
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of 
14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total 
clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately 
400 ml/min. The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving 
the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency to 
a hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and 
rabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at 
maternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, 
the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
A delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. 
The relevance for humans is unknown.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell 
hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is 
not clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and 
higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not 
observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species 
investigated.

medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking Oprymea together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
-
-
-
-
cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)
amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson’s disease)

94
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with 
you if you should continue to take Oprymea.
The effect of Oprymea on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take Oprymea if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. Oprymea can reduce the production of breast milk. 
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of Oprymea is unavoidable, 
breast-feeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Oprymea can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, do 
not drive or use machines.
Oprymea has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate 
machinery. Please tell your doctor if this occurs.

96
If you stop taking Oprymea
Do not stop taking Oprymea without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking this 
medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.
If you suffer from Parkinson’s disease you should not stop treatment with Oprymea abruptly. A 
sudden stop could cause you to develop a medical condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
which may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
akinesia (loss of muscle movement)
rigid muscles
fever
unstable blood pressure
tachycardia (increased heart rate)
confusion
depressed level of consciousness (e.g. coma).
If you stop or reduce Oprymea you may also develop a medical condition called dopamine agonist 
withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms include depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. If 
you experience these symptoms you should contact your physician.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Oprymea is and what it is used for
Oprymea contains the active substance pramipexole and belongs to a group of medicines known as 
dopamine agonists, which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain. Stimulation of the dopamine 
receptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.
Oprymea is used to treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson’s disease in adults. It can be used alone 
or in combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson’s disease).
2. What you need to know before you take Oprymea
Do not take Oprymea
-
if you are allergic to pramipexole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Oprymea. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any medical 
conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:
-
-
Kidney disease
Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are 
visual
Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced 
Parkinson’s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-
titration of Oprymea
Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In 
particular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), 
forward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back 
-

(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change 
your medication. 
Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep
Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia)
Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with Oprymea
Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked 
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall 
in blood pressure on standing up).
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to 
adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling 
elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor 
may need to adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or 
pain after stopping or reducing your Oprymea treatment. If the problems persist more than a few 
weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.
Oprymea prolonged-release tablet is a specially designed tablet from which the active ingredient is 
gradually released, once the tablet has been ingested. Parts of tablets may occasionally be passed and 
seen in the stool (faeces) and may look like whole tablets. Inform your doctor if you find tablet pieces 
in your faeces.
Children and adolescents
Oprymea is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Oprymea
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking Oprymea together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
-
-
-
-
cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)
amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson’s disease)
mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia)
zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a 
disease of the human immune system)
cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers)
quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the 
treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria))
procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat).
-
-
-
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start 
treatment with Oprymea.
Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are 
drinking alcohol. In these cases Oprymea may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.
Oprymea with food, drink and alcohol
103
You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with Oprymea.
Oprymea can be taken with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with 
you if you should continue to take Oprymea.
The effect of Oprymea on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take Oprymea if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. Oprymea can reduce the production of breast milk. 
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of Oprymea is unavoidable, 
breast-feeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Oprymea can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, do 
not drive or use machines.
Oprymea has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate 
machinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs.

Patients with kidney disease
If you have kidney disease, your doctor may advise you to take the usual starting dose of 0.26 mg
prolonged-release tablets only every other day for the first week. After that, your doctor may increase 
the dosing frequency to one 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablet every day. If a further dose increase is 
necessary, your doctor may adjust it in steps of 0.26 mg pramipexole.
If you have serious kidney problems, your doctor may need to switch you to a different pramipexole 
medicine. If during treatment your kidney problems get worse, you should contact your doctor as soon 
as possible.
If you are switching from Oprymea (immediate release) tablets
Your doctor will base your dose of Oprymea prolonged-release tablets on the dose of Oprymea
(immediate release) tablets you were taking.
Take your Oprymea (immediate release) tablets as normal the day before you switch. Then take your 
Oprymea prolonged-release tablets next morning and do not take any more Oprymea (immediate

double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet dose.
If you stop taking Oprymea
Do not stop taking Oprymea without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking this 
medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.
If you suffer from Parkinson’s disease you should not stop treatment with Oprymea abruptly. A

which may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include:
-
-
-

-
-
akinesia (loss of muscle movement)
rigid muscles
fever
unstable blood pressure

you experience these symptoms you should contact your physician.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Oprymea is and what it is used for
Oprymea contains the active substance pramipexole and belongs to a group of medicines known as 
dopamine agonists, which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain. Stimulation of the dopamine 
receptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.
Oprymea is used to treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson’s disease in adults. It can be used alone 
or in combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson’s disease).
2. What you need to know before you take Oprymea
Do not take Oprymea
-
if you are allergic to pramipexole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Oprymea. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any medical 
conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:
-
-
Kidney disease
Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are 
visual
Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced 
Parkinson’s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-
titration of Oprymea
Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In 
particular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), 
forward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back 
(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change 
your medication. 
Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep
Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia)
-
-
-
-
110
-
-
Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with Oprymea
Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked 
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall 
in blood pressure on standing up).
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to 
adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling 
elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor 
may need to adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or 
pain after stopping or reducing your Oprymea treatment. If the problems persist more than a few 
weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.
Oprymea prolonged-release tablet is a specially designed tablet from which the active ingredient is 
gradually released, once the tablet has been ingested. Parts of tablets may occasionally be passed and 
seen in the stool (faeces) and may look like whole tablets. Inform your doctor if you find tablet pieces 
in your faeces.
Children and adolescents
Oprymea is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Oprymea
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking Oprymea together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
-
-
-
-
cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers);
amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson’s disease);
mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia);
zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a 
disease of the human immune system);
cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers);
quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the 
treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria));
procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat).
-
-
-
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start 
treatment with Oprymea.
Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are 
drinking alcohol. In these cases Oprymea may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.
Oprymea with food, drink and alcohol
You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with Oprymea.
Oprymea can be taken with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
111
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with 
you if you should continue to take Oprymea.
The effect of Oprymea on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take Oprymea if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. Oprymea can reduce the production of breast milk. 
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of Oprymea is unavoidable, 
breast-feeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Oprymea can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, do 
not drive or use machines.
Oprymea has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate 
machinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs.

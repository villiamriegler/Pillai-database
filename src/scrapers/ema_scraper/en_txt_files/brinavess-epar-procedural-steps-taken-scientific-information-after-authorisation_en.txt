Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
including all variations introduced since the marketing 
authorisation was granted, the benefit-risk balance of 
Brinavess in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics) remains favourable 
and therefore the renewal of the marketing authorisation is 
recommended, subject to the conditions as detailed in 
Annex II. 
The renewal is recommended to be granted with unlimited 
validity.

characteristics (SmPC) is being updated following updates 
the Company Core Safety Datasheet (CCDS) based 
and PL 
to the Company Core Safety Datasheet (CCDS) based on 
on the results of an integrated safety analysis 
performed on data of existing clinical studies. The 
Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

data of existing clinical studies with a stronger emphasis on 
treatment-related ADRs and an incidence rate above one 
percent.

The warnings regarding hypotension, congestive heart 
failure, atrial flutter and valvular heart disease were 
modified in section 4.4 of the SmPC and adverse events 
“headache”, “chest discomfort” and “ECQ QT prolonged” 
were removed from section 4.8 of the SmPC. These 
changes were considered consistent with the pooled trial 
data in the updated summary of clinical safety.  
The PL has been updated accordingly. 
Update of the RMP to version 7.0 to incorporate the 
results from the new safety analysis and from the 
non-interventional PASS SPECTRUM study, listed as 
a category 3 study in the RMP (PASS Protocol 6621-
049).   
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2,

Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Brinavess continues to be favourable. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that an additional five-year 
renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds was 
required.

inconclusive. Nevertheless the risk minimization tools will 
be enhanced and the Pre-Infusion check list will be included

SmPC and PL 
Following the assessment of the last PSUR and in view of 
the case reports of hypotension and bradycardia that have 
been assessed it was proposed to update sections 4.2 and 
4.4 of the SmPC to provide further guidance to the 
healthcare providers regarding the way patients should be 
monitored during and after administration of Brinavess. 
With current variation the information was introduced that 
patient should be frequently monitored for the duration of 
the infusion of Brinavess and for at least 15 minutes after 
the completion of the infusion for signs and symptoms of a 
sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart rate. 
to update the safety information related to the 
administration of vernakalant hydrochloride following 
the recommendations from the assessment of PSUR 
005. As a consequence, the description of the 
educational material was updated. The Package 
Leaflet was updated in accordance. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to propose small editorial 
changes in Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC and in 
the Package Leaflet.

subsequent cardiogenic shock has been reported in a 
patient receiving i.v. vernakalant in an ongoing clinical 
study (ACT V). Shortly after the infusion was completed, 
the patient developed hypotension with cardiac arrest and 
pulseless electrical activity. A complicated and prolonged 
resuscitation involving electrical defibrillation and the use of 
DC cardioversion and amiodarone followed. The patient 
developed multi-organ failure and passed away 28 days 
after the initial event. Following the assessment of the 
information related to this serious case the CHMP 
recommended modification of the SmPC. Close monitoring 
of vital signs and continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm 
during administration of vernakalant, and up to 2 hours 
after the start of infusion until clinical and ECG parameters 
have stabilised, is recommended. Blood pressure should 
also be monitored, both during vernakalant infusion and at 
least 15 minutes after the infusion is completed. Patients 
must not be given any i.v. anti-arrhythmic drugs (class I or 
class III) within 4 hours prior to, during or up to 4 hours 
after vernakalant administration. PL and the educational 
materials were updated to reflect the changes to the SmPC.

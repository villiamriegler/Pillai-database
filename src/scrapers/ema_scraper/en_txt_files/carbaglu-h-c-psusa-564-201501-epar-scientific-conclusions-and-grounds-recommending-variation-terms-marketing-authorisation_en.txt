Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for carglumic acid, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Carbaglu is authorised for oral use. During the period covered by this PSUR, 4 cases of incorrect 
administration of Carbaglu by intravenous infusion have been identified, one of which had a fatal 
outcome. When considering these cases, the PRAC noted that there is the potential for certain wording in 
the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and/or in the patient leaflet to be misinterpreted as it 
mentions administration by syringe but does not unequivocally clarify that Carbaglu is for oral 
administration only. Therefore the PRAC considered that this information should be added to the relevant 
sections of the SmPC, labelling and package leaflet. 
Following the reprocessing of cases using a new methodology as requested in the recent 
pharmacovigilance inspection, 9 events of ‘rash’ which occurred in 2 patients were identified in the safety 
database. On the basis of this information, the PRAC agreed on the need to list this adverse reaction in the 
product information. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding rash and cases of incorrect route of administration, the 
PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for carglumic acid the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing carglumic acid is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

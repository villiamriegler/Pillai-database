1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The Commission Decision for II/0028 (see below) was 
issued on 21/09/2022. As the outcome of that procedure 
concluded with the granting of a MAH no longer subject to 
Specific Obligations for Crysvita, there was no longer any 
regulatory need to continue with the ongoing renewal 
procedure R/0031 after the date of that Commission 
Decision.  Hence, the procedure for R/0031 was stopped 
and as a consequence did not proceed to a CHMP opinion 
and Commission Decision. 
The dates 13/10/2022 and 13/10/2022 to the left are 
arbitrarily chosen and do not correspond with any actual 
regulatory outcome.

SmPC, Annex 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
to update the frequency of the adverse drug 
reactions, to split immunogenicity data into 
paediatric and adult populations and to update 
clinical efficacy in paediatric patients, upon request 
by the CHMP following the assessment of PAM 
procedures P46/006 and P46/007 and type II 
variations II/04 and II/10/G, based on the final 
results from studies UX023-CL201, UX023-CL205 
and UX023-CL301. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. As a consequence of the provision of the 
II, Labelling 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
and PL 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP 
considered that, as all Specific Obligations have been 
fulfilled, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisations to remain conditional and therefore 
recommends the granting of the MA no longer subject to 
Specific Obligations for Crysvita. For more information,

final CSR for study UX023-CL205, the last remaining 
specific obligation was deleted from the Annex II. 
This was an open-label, phase 2 study undertaken to 
assess the safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy 
of KRN23 in paediatric patients between 1 and 4 
years old with X-linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH). 
With the fulfilment of this specific obligation the MAH 
is requesting for the Crysvita MA to no longer be 
subject to specific obligations. The RMP version 5.0 
was agreed.

efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamics in paediatric 
patients aged 1-12 years with X-linked 
Hypophosphataemia (XLH). The provision of the final 
CSR addresses Specific Obligation 2 (ANX 002). The 
Package Leaflet and Annex II have been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in the 
SmPC to increase readability.

the safety profile being similar and no new safety issues 
being identified. The SmPC section 4.2 was updated in 
terms of the recommended starting dose. Section 4.3 and 
other several sections of the SmPC clarify that it is the 
active form of vitamin-D that is contraindicated. The 
summary of the safety profile in section 4.8 was also 
updated to reflect the adverse events confirmed during the 
clinical study and section 5.1 is now reflecting the data 
from the submitted Phase 3 study. The pharmacokinetic 
data support the change in section 5.2 that following 
multiple dose administration to paediatric subjects, a 
plateau is reached for serum concentration of burosumab 
by 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. For more

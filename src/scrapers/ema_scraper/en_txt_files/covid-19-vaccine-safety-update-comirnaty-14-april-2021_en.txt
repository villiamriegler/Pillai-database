COVID-19 vaccine 
safety update  
COMIRNATY 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH 
Specific allergic skin reactions will be added to 
the product information. 
There are no recommended changes to the 
product information regarding how to use this 
vaccine; Comirnaty is effective in preventing 
COVID-19. 
Safety updates provide information about the assessments of emerging 
worldwide data since marketing authorisation for COVID-19 vaccines. The 
assessments are carried out by EMA’s safety committee 
(Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee [PRAC]). The safety 
updates are published regularly at COVID-19 vaccines: authorised.  
All published safety updates for Comirnaty are available at Comirnaty: 
safety updates. 
This safety update follows the last update of 29 March 2021. 
Since the marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) on 21 
December 2020 until 9 April 2021, more than 60 million doses of 
Comirnaty have been administered in the EU/EEA1. 
1 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) collects these data 
from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the European 
Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

COVID-19 vaccine safety update 
COMIRNATY 
1.  Updates on safety of Comirnaty 
At its meeting held 6 to 9 April 2021, PRAC assessed the following in 
relation to:  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Based on data from clinical trials and use in vaccination campaigns, PRAC 
requested the addition of the following hypersensitivity reactions (allergic 
reactions) to the product information of Comirnaty: skin rash and pruritus 
(itching of the skin) as uncommon side effects (occurring in less than 1 in 
100 persons), and urticaria (raised, red and itchy skin rash) and 
angioedema (rapid swelling under the skin) as rare side effects (occurring 
in less than 1 in 1,000 persons). 
2.  Other information for Comirnaty 
Comirnaty is a vaccine that was authorised in the EU for use in people 
aged 16 years and older to prevent COVID-19 when infected with the 
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is a potentially severe disease that 
may result in death. 
Comirnaty contains a molecule called mRNA, which the body uses to 
temporarily produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is broken 
down shortly after vaccination. The spike protein does not cause COVID-
19.  
Before Comirnaty was granted an EU marketing authorisation, the efficacy 
and safety of the vaccine were assessed through pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. More than 18,000 participants have been given the 
vaccine in clinical trials.  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not 
everybody will experience them. The most common side effects known for 
Comirnaty are usually mild or moderate and get better within a few days 
after vaccination. 
More information on how Comirnaty works and its use is available in the 
medicine overview. This includes information on use in pregnant and 
breastfeeding women and immunocompromised individuals. 
Information in all EU/EEA languages is available in the product 
information, which includes the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet. 
3.  How safety is monitored 
As for all COVID-19 vaccines, relevant new information emerging on 
Comirnaty is collected and promptly reviewed. This is in line with the 
pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU regulatory

network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member States, EMA 
and the European Commission). 
Collecting case reports of suspected side effects 
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors reports of suspected 
side effects observed in vaccinated individuals. These case reports are 
collected and recorded in EudraVigilance, a system operated by EMA for 
managing and analysing information on suspected side effects of 
medicines. 
Vaccinated individuals and healthcare professionals should report 
suspected side effects via the national reporting systems, which also 
contribute to EudraVigilance. For more information, see Reporting 
suspected side effects. Information on how to report in your Member State 
is available in the package leaflet and via the list of national competent 
authorities. 
You may visit EudraVigilance – European database of suspected drug 
reaction reports and search for “COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine PFIZER-
BIONTECH (Tozinameran)” to see all suspected side effects reported for 
Comirnaty in the EU/EEA. Please note that these reports describe 
suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. these events may not necessarily 
have been caused by, or be otherwise related to, the vaccine. 
Planned and ongoing studies 
The company that markets Comirnaty will continue to provide results from 
the main clinical trial, which is ongoing for up to two years. It will also 
conduct additional studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the 
vaccine as it is used in vaccination campaigns and other clinical practice. 
For the list of planned and ongoing safety studies for Comirnaty, see the 
risk management plan.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Comirnaty is in place. This 
describes how the company will collect data on the vaccine’s efficacy and 
safety for its potential use in children.  
In addition, EMA is coordinating observational studies in EU Member 
States looking at real-world data from clinical practice to monitor the 
safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including in pregnant 
women.

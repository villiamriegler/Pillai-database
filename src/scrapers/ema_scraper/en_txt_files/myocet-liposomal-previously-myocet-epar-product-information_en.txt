CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Myocet liposomal, in combination with cyclophosphamide, is indicated for the first line treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer in adult women. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of Myocet liposomal should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
use of chemotherapy. 
Posology 
When Myocet liposomal is administered in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) the 
initial recommended dose of Myocet liposomal is 60-75 mg/m2 every three weeks. 
Older people 
Safety and efficacy of Myocet liposomal have been assessed in 61 patients with metastatic breast 
cancer, age 65 and over. Data from randomised controlled clinical trials show that the efficacy and 
cardiac safety of Myocet liposomal in this population was comparable to that observed in patients less 
than 65 years old. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
As metabolism and excretion of doxorubicin occurs primarily by the hepatobiliary route, evaluation of 
hepatobiliary function should be performed before and during therapy with Myocet liposomal.  
Based on limited data in patients with liver metastases, it is recommended that the initial dose of 
Myocet liposomal is reduced in accordance with the following table.

If possible, Myocet liposomal should be avoided in patients with bilirubin > 50 μmol/l as the 
recommendation is based mainly on extrapolations. 
For dose reductions due to other toxicity, see section 4.4. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Doxorubicin is metabolised largely by the liver and excreted in the bile. Therefore dose modification 
is not required for patients with renal function impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Myocet liposomal in children aged up to 17 years has not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Myocet liposomal must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to administration. A final 
concentration of between 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml doxorubicin HCl, is required. Myocet liposomal is 
administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour.  
Myocet liposomal must not be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or as a bolus 
injection. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression 
Therapy with Myocet liposomal causes myelosuppression. Myocet liposomal should not be 
administered to individuals with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) lower than 1,500 cells/µl or 
platelets less than 100,000/µl prior to the next cycle. Careful haematological monitoring (including 
white blood cell and platelet count, and haemoglobin) should be performed during therapy with 
Myocet liposomal. 
A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of grade 4 neutropenia (RR = 0.82, 
p=0.005) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus conventional doxorubicin. However, no 
significant differences were identified in the occurrence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and episodes 
of neutropenic fever. 
Haematological as well as other toxicity may require dose reductions or delays. The following dosage 
modifications are recommended during therapy and should be performed in parallel for both Myocet 
liposomal and cyclophosphamide. Dosing subsequent to a dose reduction is left to the discretion of the 
physician in charge of the patient.

For dose reduction of Myocet liposomal due to liver function impairment, see section 4.2. 
Cardiac toxicity 
Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines can cause cardiotoxicity. The risk of toxicity rises with 
increasing cumulative doses of those medicinal products and is higher in individuals with a history of 
cardiomyopathy, or mediastinal irradiation or pre-existing cardiac disease. 
Analyses of cardiotoxicity in clinical trials have shown a statistically significant reduction in cardiac 
events in patients treated with Myocet liposomal compared to patients treated with conventional 
doxorubicin at the same dose in mg. A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of 
both clinical heart failure (RR = 0.20, p=0.02) and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined (RR 
= 0.38, p<0.0001) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus conventional doxorubicin. The 
reduced risk of cardiotoxicity has also been shown in a retrospective analysis in patients who had 
received prior adjuvant doxorubicin (log-rank P=0.001, Hazard Ratio=5.42). 
In a phase III study in combination with cyclophosphamide (CPA) comparing Myocet liposomal 
(60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2), 6% versus 21% 
of patients, respectively, developed a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
In a phase III study comparing single-agent Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) versus single-agent 
doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), 12% versus 27% of patients, respectively developed a significant decrease in 
LVEF. The corresponding figures for congestive heart failure, which was less accurately assessed, 
were 0% for Myocet liposomal + CPA versus 3% for doxorubicin + CPA, and 2% for Myocet 
liposomal versus 8% for doxorubicin. The median lifetime cumulative dose of Myocet liposomal in 
combination with CPA to a cardiac event was > 1260 mg/m2, compared to 480 mg/m2 for doxorubicin 
combination with CPA. 
There is no experience with Myocet liposomal in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, e.g. 
myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to treatment. Thus, caution should be exercised in patients 
with impaired cardiac function. The cardiac function of the patients treated concomitantly with 
Myocet liposomal and trastuzumab must be appropriately monitored as described below. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The total dose of Myocet liposomal should also take into account any previous, or concomitant, 
therapy with other cardiotoxic compounds, including anthracyclines and anthraquinones. 
Before initiation of Myocet liposomal therapy a measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) is routinely recommended, either by Multiple Gated Arteriography (MUGA) or by 
echocardiography. These methods should also be applied routinely during Myocet liposomal 
treatment. The evaluation of left ventricular function is considered mandatory before each additional 
administration of Myocet liposomal once a patient exceeds a lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose of 
550 mg/m2 or whenever cardiomyopathy is suspected. If LVEF has decreased substantially from 
baseline e.g. by > 20 points to a final value > 50% or by > 10 points to a final value of < 50%, the 
benefit of continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of producing irreversible 
cardiac damage. However, the most definitive test for anthracycline myocardial injury, i.e., 
endomyocardial biopsy, should be considered. 
All patients receiving Myocet liposomal should also routinely undergo ECG monitoring. Transient 
ECG changes such as T-wave flattening, S-T segment depression and benign arrhythmias are not 
considered mandatory indications for the cessation of Myocet liposomal therapy. However, reduction 
of the QRS complex is considered more indicative of cardiac toxicity. 
Congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, and may also be encountered 
after discontinuation of therapy. 
Gastroinstestinal disorders 
A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of nausea/vomiting grade ≥ 3 (RR = 0.65, 
p=0.04) and diarrhoea grade ≥ 3(RR = 0.33, p=0.03) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus 
conventional doxorubicin. 
Injection site reactions 
Myocet liposomal should be considered an irritant and precautions should be taken to avoid 
extravasation. If extravasation occurs, the infusion should be immediately terminated. Ice may be 
applied to the affected area for approximately 30 minutes. Subsequently, the Myocet liposomal 
infusion should be restarted in a different vein than that in which the extravasation has occurred. Note 
that Myocet liposomal may be administered through a central or peripheral vein. In the clinical 
program, there were nine cases of accidental extravasation of Myocet liposomal, none of which were 
associated with severe skin damage, ulceration or necrosis. 
Infusion associated reactions 
When infused rapidly acute reactions associated with liposomal infusions have been reported. 
Reported symptoms have included flushing, dyspnoea, fever, facial swelling, headache, back pain, 
chills, tightness in the chest and throat, and/or hypotension. These acute phenomena may be avoided 
by using a 1-hour infusion time. 
Other 
For precautions regarding the use of Myocet liposomal with other medicinal products, see section 4.5. 
As for other anthracyclines and doxorubicin products, radiation recall may occur in previously 
irradiated fields. 
Efficacy and safety of Myocet liposomal in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer have not been 
determined. The importance of apparent differences in tissue distribution between Myocet liposomal 
and conventional doxorubicin has not been elucidated with respect to long-term antitumour efficacy. 
Excipients 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains approximately 108 mg sodium per 50 mg doxorubicin HCL dose, 
equivalent to 5.4 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific medicinal product compatibility studies have not been performed with Myocet liposomal. 
Myocet liposomal is likely to interact with substances that are known to interact with conventional 
doxorubicin. Plasma levels of doxorubicin and its metabolite, doxorubicinol, may be increased when 
doxorubicin is administered with cyclosporin, verapamil, paclitaxel or other agents that inhibit P-
glycoprotein (P-Gp). Interactions with doxorubicin have also been reported for streptozocin, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin and warfarin. Studies of the effect of Myocet liposomal on other substances 
are also lacking. However, doxorubicin may potentiate the toxicity of other antineoplastic agents. 
Concomitant treatment with other substances reported to be cardiotoxic or with cardiologically active 
substances (e.g. calcium antagonists) may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity. Concomitant therapy 
with other liposomal or lipid-complexed substances or intravenous fat emulsions could change the 
pharmacokinetic profile of Myocet liposomal. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective contraceptive during treatment with Myocet 
liposomal and for 6.5 months following discontinuation of therapy.  
Women desiring to have children following completion of therapy should be recommended to obtain 
genetic counselling and advice on fertility preservation before treatment. 
Pregnancy 
Due to the known cytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties of doxorubicin, Myocet liposomal 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  
Breast-feeding 
Women receiving Myocet liposomal should not breastfeed.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Myocet liposomal has been reported to cause dizziness. Patients who suffer from this should avoid 
driving and operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
During clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea/vomiting (73%), 
leucopoenia (70%), alopecia (66%), neutropenia (46%), asthenia/fatigue (46%), stomatitis/mucositis 
(42%), thrombocytopenia (31%) and anaemia (30%). 
The following adverse reactions have been reported with Myocet liposomal during clinical studies and 
post marketing experience. Adverse reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system 
organ class and frequency (frequencies are defined as: very common ≥1/10, common ≥1/100 to <1/10, 
uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, anthracyclines and related substances, ATC code: 
L01DB01 
The active substance in Myocet liposomal is doxorubicin HCl. Doxorubicin may exert its antitumour 
and toxic effects by a number of mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II, intercalation 
with DNA and RNA polymerases, free radical formation and membrane binding. Liposomal-
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encapsulated doxorubicin compared with conventional doxorubicin was not found more active in 
doxorubicin resistant cell lines in vitro. In animals, liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin reduced the 
distribution to heart and gastrointestinal mucosa compared with conventional doxorubicin, while 
antitumoural efficacy in experimental tumours was maintained.  
Myocet liposomal (60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) was compared with conventional doxorubicin + 
CPA (at the same doses) and Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) was compared to 
epirubicin + CPA (at the same doses). In a third trial, Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) monotherapy was 
compared with conventional doxorubicin monotherapy (at the same dose). Findings regarding 
response rate and progression-free survival are provided in Table 3.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The plasma pharmacokinetics for total doxorubicin in patients receiving Myocet liposomal shows a 
high degree of inter-patient variability. In general however, the plasma levels of total doxorubicin are 
substantially higher with Myocet liposomal than with conventional doxorubicin, while the data 
indicate that peak plasma levels of free (not liposome-encapsulated) doxorubicin are lower with 
Myocet liposomal than with conventional doxorubicin. Available pharmacokinetic data preclude 
conclusions regarding the relationship between plasma levels of total/free doxorubicin and its 
influence on the efficacy/safety of Myocet liposomal. The clearance of total doxorubicin was 
5.1 ± 4.8 l/h and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vd) was 56.6 ± 61.5 l whereas after 
conventional doxorubicin, clearance and Vd were 46.7 ± 9.6 l/h and 1,451 ± 258 l, respectively. The 
major circulating metabolite of doxorubicin, doxorubicinol, is formed via aldo-keto-reductase. The 
peak levels of doxorubicinol occur in the plasma later with Myocet liposomal than with conventional 
doxorubicin. 
The pharmacokinetics of Myocet liposomal have not been specifically studied in patients with renal 
insufficiency. Doxorubicin is known to be eliminated in large part by the liver. A dose reduction of 
Myocet liposomal has been shown to be appropriate in patients with impaired hepatic function (see 
section 4.2 for dosage recommendations). 
Substances that inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-Gp) have been shown to alter the disposition of doxorubicin 
and doxorubicinol (see also section 4.5).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Studies of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity of Myocet liposomal have not been 
performed but doxorubicin is known to be both mutagenic and carcinogenic and may cause toxicity to 
reproduction.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Preparation of Myocet liposomal 
Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout handling of Myocet liposomal, since no 
preservative is present. 
Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of Myocet liposomal. The use of gloves is 
required 
Step 1.  Set up 
Two alternative heating methods can be used : a Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater or a water bath: 
•  Turn on the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater and set the controller to 75°C-76°C. Verify the 
• 
temperature set point by checking the thermometer(s) on each heat block insert.   
If using a water bath, turn on the water bath and allow it to equilibrate at 58°C (55°C-60°C).  
Verify the temperature set point by checking the thermometer.   
(Please note that whilst the control settings on the water bath and heat block are set to different levels 
the temperature of the vial contents are in the same range (55°C-60°C)). 
Remove the carton of constituents from the refrigerator. 
Step 2.  Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl 
•  Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride solution for injection (0.9%), (not provided in the package), and 
inject into each vial of doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation.  
•  Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved. 
Step 3.  Heat in water bath or dry heat block  
•  Heat the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the 
thermometer in the block reading (75°C-76°C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). If using 
a water bath, heat the doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading 55°C-60°C 
for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). 
•  While heating proceed to step 4 
Step 4.  Adjust pH of liposomes 
•  Withdraw 1.9 ml of liposomes. Inject into the buffer vial to adjust the pH of liposomes.  Pressure 
build-up may require venting. 
•  Shake well. 
Step 5.  Add pH-adjusted liposomes to doxorubicin 
•  Using a syringe, withdraw the entire vial contents of pH-adjusted liposomes from the buffer vial. 
•  Remove the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial from the water bath or dry heat block. SHAKE 
VIGOROUSLY. Carefully insert a pressure-venting device equipped with a hydrophobic filter.  
Then IMMEDIATELY (within 2 minutes) inject pH-adjusted liposomes into vial of heated 
reconstituted doxorubicin HCl. Remove venting device. 
•  SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. 
•  WAIT for a minimum of 10 MINUTES before using, keeping the medicine at room temperature.

•  The Techne DB-3 Dri Block Heater is fully validated for use in the constitution of Myocet 
liposomal. Three inserts, each with two 43.7mm openings per insert must be used. To ensure 
correct temperature control the use of a 35mm immersion thermometer is recommended.  
The resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet liposomal contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml 
of liposomal dispersion (2 mg/ml).  
After reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for 
injection, or 5% (w/v) glucose solution for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml so that a final 
concentration of 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml doxorubicin is obtained. 
Once constituted, the liposomal dispersion for infusion containing liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin 
should be a red orange opaque homogeneous dispersion. All parenteral solutions should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the preparation if 
foreign particulate matter is present. 
Procedure for proper disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Myocet liposomal is and what is it used for 
Myocet liposomal contains a medicine called “doxorubicin”, which damages tumour cells. This type 
of medicine is called “chemotherapy”. The medicine is contained inside very small droplets of fat 
called “liposomes”. 
Myocet liposomal is used in adult women for the first-line treatment of breast cancer that has spread 
(“metastatic breast cancer”). It is used with another medicine called “cyclophosphamide”. Please also 
read the patient information leaflet carefully that comes with that medicine. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Myocet liposomal  
Do not have Myocet liposomal: 
•  if you are allergic to doxorubicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
Do not have Myocet liposomal if this applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before having Myocet liposomal. 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before having Myocet liposomal.  
Check with your doctor or nurse before having your medicine if: 
•  you have ever had heart problems such as a heart attack, heart failure or you have had high blood 
pressure for a long time 
•  you have liver problems. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having 
Myocet liposomal. 
Tests 
Your doctor will do tests during your treatment to check that the medicine is working properly. They 
will also look out for any side effects such as blood problems or heart problems. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Radiation therapy 
If you have already had radiation therapy, this may react with Myocet liposomal. You may get painful, 
red or dry skin. This can happen straight away or later on in your treatment.  
Other medicines and Myocet liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Myocet liposomal can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines 
can affect the way Myocet liposomal works. 
In particular tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
•  phenobarbital or phenytoin – for epilepsy 
•  warfarin – for thinning the blood 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), please talk to your doctor or nurse before having 
Myocet liposomal. 
streptozotocin – for cancer of the pancreas 
cyclosporine – for changing your immune system. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before having Myocet liposomal.  
•  Myocet liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  
•  Women having Myocet liposomal should not breast-feed.  
•  Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment with Myocet 
liposomal and for 6.5 months after treatment. 
•  Women desiring to have children following completion of therapy are recommended to obtain 
genetic counselling and advice on fertility preservation before treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
You may feel dizzy after having Myocet liposomal. If you feel dizzy or are not sure how you feel, do 
not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Myocet liposomal contains sodium  
Myocet liposomal is available in cartons containing 1 set or 2 sets of 3 vials (not all pack-sizes may be 
marketed). When the 3 vials have been mixed together, your medicine contains about 108 mg sodium 
(main component of cooking/table salt). This is equivalent to 5.4 % of the recommended maximum 
daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
3.  How Myocet liposomal is given 
This medicine is normally given by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein. 
How much you will be given 
Your doctor will work out exactly how much you need. This is based on the size of your body 
(measured in “square metres” or “m2”). 
The recommended dose is between 60 and 75 mg of the medicine for each square meter of your body: 
• 
this is given once every 3 weeks 
• 
the medicine “cyclophosphamide” is given on the same day. 
The doctor may give you a lower dose if they think you need it. 
the stage of your breast cancer 
The number of times you have the drip depends on: 
• 
•  how well your body responds to the medicine. 
Treatment usually lasts for about 3 to 6 months. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you get Myocet liposomal on your skin 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if any medicine leaks from the drip (infusion) onto your skin. 
This is because Myocet liposomal can damage your skin. The drip will be stopped straight away. Ice 
will be put on the affected area for 30 minutes. Then the drip will be started in another vein. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4.

•  Personnel should be trained to reconstitute the medicinal product. 
•  Pregnant staff should be excluded from handling the medicinal product. 
•  Personnel handling this medicinal product during reconstitution should wear protective 
clothing including masks, goggles and gloves. 
•  All items for administration or cleaning, including gloves, should be placed in a high-risk, 
waste disposal bag for high-temperature incineration. Liquid waste may be flushed with large 
amounts of water. 
•  Accidental contact with the skin or eyes should be treated immediately with copious amounts 
of water.

3.1  Preparation of Myocet liposomal 
Step 1.  Set up 
Two alternative heating methods can be used : a Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater or a water bath: 
•  Turn on the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater and set the controller to 75°C-76°C.  Verify the 
• 
temperature set point by checking the thermometer(s) on each heat block insert.   
If using a water bath, turn on the water bath and allow it to equilibrate at 58°C (55°C-60°C).  
Verify the temperature set point by checking the thermometer.   
(Please note that whilst the control settings on the water bath and heat block are set to different levels 
the temperature of the vial contents are in the same range (55°C-60°C)). 
•  Remove the carton of constituents from the refrigerator. 
Step 2.  Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl 
•  Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride solution for injection (0.9%), (not provided in the package), 
and inject into each vial of doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation.  
•  Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved. 
Step 3.  Heat in water bath or dry heat block 
•  Heat the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the 
thermometer in the block reading (75°C-76°C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes).   
If using a water bath, heat the doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading 
55°C-60°C for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). 
• 
•  While heating proceed to step 4. 
Step 4.  Adjust pH of liposomes 
•  Withdraw 1.9 ml of liposomes. Inject into the buffer vial to adjust the pH of liposomes.  
Pressure build-up may require venting. 
•  Shake well. 
Step 5.  Add pH-adjusted liposomes to doxorubicin 
•  Using a syringe, withdraw the entire vial contents of pH-adjusted liposomes from the buffer 
vial. 
•  Remove the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial from the water bath or dry heat block.  
SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. Carefully insert a pressure-venting device equipped with a 
hydrophobic filter. Then IMMEDIATELY (within 2 minutes) inject the pH-adjusted 
liposomes into the vial of heated reconstituted doxorubicin HCl. Remove venting device. 
•  SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. 
•  WAIT FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 MINUTES BEFORE USING, KEEPING THE MEDICINE 
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. 
The Techne DB-3 Dri Block Heater is fully validated for use in the constitution of Myocet liposomal. 
Three inserts, each with two 43.7mm openings per insert must be used. To ensure correct temperature 
control the use of a 35mm immersion thermometer is recommended. 
The resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet liposomal contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml 
of concentrate for liposomal dispersion for infusion (2 mg/ml).  
After reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride 
solution for injection, or 5% (w/v) glucose solution for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml 
per 50 mg reconstituted Myocet liposomal so that a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml 
doxorubicin is obtained. 
Once constituted, the liposomal dispersion for infusion containing liposome encapsulated doxorubicin 
should be a red-orange opaque homogeneous dispersion. All parenteral medicinal products should be 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the 
preparation if foreign particulate matter is present. 
It has been demonstrated that once reconstituted Myocet liposomal has a chemical and physical in-use 
stability at room temperature for up to 8 hours or in a refrigerator (2οC-8οC) for up to 5 days.  
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2οC-8οC, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken 
place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Myocet liposomal should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour.  
Warning: Myocet liposomal must not be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or 
as a bolus injection. 
4. 
DISPOSAL 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

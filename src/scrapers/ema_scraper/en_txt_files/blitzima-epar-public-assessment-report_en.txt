2.  Scientific discussion 
Introduction 
Rituximab was first authorised in the European Union on 2 June 1998 under the name of MabThera. It is also 
marketed under the name Rituxan in the United States (US). It is currently approved for the following 
indications:  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
− 
treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with 
chemotherapy. 
−  maintenance therapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy. 
−  monotherapy for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo-resistant or are 
in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
− 
treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with 
CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
− 
in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and 
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis 
in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult patients with severe, 
active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
The conditions covered by the above indications have been extensively analysed through the respective 
approval procedures of Mabthera (see Mabthera European assessment report – EPAR) 
Rituximab is a chimeric human-murine immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to 
the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature 
B lymphocytes. CD20 is located on pre-B and mature B-cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, 
normal plasma cells or other normal cells. CD20 is also expressed on >95% of all B-cells in non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. This antigen does not internalise upon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 
does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding.CD20 
regulates an early step in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions 
as a calcium ion channel. After binding to the CD20 antigen on the cell surface, rituximab exerts its therapeutic 
effect by promoting B-cell lysis. 
The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can recruit 
immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated cell lysis include 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, 
macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes has also been demonstrated 
to induce cell death via apoptosis.

The therapeutic benefit of the destruction of malignant B-cells in the oncological indications of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL results in control of tumour growth and translates in 
extension of survival.  
B-cells also play several important roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). They produce auto-antibodies such as Rheumatoid Factor 
(RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) antibody in RA or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) 
in MPA and CPA. In the synovium, RF immune complexes may mediate complement activation and the 
propagation of the inflammatory cascade. B-cells present in the RA synovial membrane may secrete a range of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, some of which are components in the process leading to joint inflammation and 
damage, or to induce leukocyte infiltration. B-cells can function as antigen-presenting cells and 
immune-regulatory cells, leading to T-cell activation. They can also stimulate osteoclasts and synovial 
fibroblasts and lead to bone erosions and joint tissue remodelling. 
Peripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In patients 
treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment and generally 
returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in some patients this may 
take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction therapy). In rheumatoid arthritis 
patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood was observed following two infusions of 
1000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day interval. Peripheral blood B cell counts begin to increase from week 
24 and evidence for repopulation is observed in the majority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was 
administered as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had 
prolonged peripheral B cell depletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased 
to <10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most 
patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with 
counts >10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. 
Mabthera is available as 100mg and 500 mg strengths as concentration  for solution for iv infusion and as 1400 
mg and 1600 mg as solution for sc injection.  
About the product 
Blitzima (also referred to as CT-P10) contains the active substance rituximab and has been developed as a 
similar biological medicinal product to the reference medicinal product MabThera.  
The formulation development process for Blitzima has been designed to replicate MabThera and both products 
are identical with respect to the pharmaceutical form and composition for the iv route of administration and the 
strength of 500mg. 
The proposed therapeutic indications and posology for CT-P10 are identical to those for MabThera, to which 
similarity is claimed. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal 
product CT-P10 under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. Similarity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017

for CT-P10 is claimed to the reference medicinal product MabThera for intravenous (IV) use as the reference 
medicinal product, which has been approved in the European Union (EU) in February 1998 (EMEA/H/C/000165). 
To demonstrate that the similar biological and reference products already authorised in the community have 
similar profiles in terms of quality, safety and efficacy an extensive comparability exercise is required. The 
clinical development programme of CT-P10 has specifically considered the EU guidelines for similar biological 
medicinal products and bioequivalence:

Although no specific Sicentific Advice has been applied for Blitzima, during the development of Truxima, of which 
Blitzima is a duplicate, the applicant sought scientific and procedural advice at the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA). The scientific advice procedures covered questions on the pharmaceutical quality, the nonclinical and 
clinical programme. 
Blitzima will be available as 500 mg concentration for solution for infusion.  
2.1.  Quality aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
Blitzima quality package is exactly the same as that submitted for the MAA of Truxima, thus the 
final assessment report adopted for Truxima is shown below:

2.1.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance, CT-P10 (rituximab), is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody subclass. Like other IgG 
subclasses, CT-P10 is a glycoprotein with one N-linked glycosylation site in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. 
Each heavy chain consists of 450 amino acids with 11 cysteine residues and each light chain consists of 213 
amino acids with 5 cysteine residues. 
CT-P10 binds to the CD20 antigen found on the surface of malignant and normal B cells. By binding to CD20 
antigen, the main mechanisms of CT-P10 are complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and induction of apoptosis.

The CT-P10 active substance is manufactured, packaged, stability and quality-control tested in accordance with 
good manufacturing practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The CT-P10 active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
fermentation, recovery, purification and filling. The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine 
in-process controls, along with acceptance criteria, are described for each step. The active substance 
manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
The production process follows a standard procedure for monoclonal antibodies production; starting from the 
thawing of a vial of the WCB followed by several cell expansion steps before final bioreactor production. CT-P10 
is purified through a series of chromatographic (affinity and ion-exchange) and filtration steps, including 4 
dedicated viral inactivation steps (2 chromatography steps, low-pH treatment and nanofiltration).  Each step of 
the purification process has been adequately described, including descriptions of the different buffers used, 
column regeneration and storage conditions.  Process hold steps are detailed and appropriate data to support 
product intermediate hold times has been provided.  The critical process parameters for each process step are 
justified and appropriate in-process controls, with justified acceptance limits, are specified.  In-process control 
tests are sufficient to ensure the microbial/viral safety of the product, and consistent quality.   
A batch of CT-P10 active substance is manufactured from a single 15,000 L production bioreactor.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been submitted. 
Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications 
(including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented.  
No raw materials of human origin are used during active substance manufacture. Only one animal derived 
material is used in the manufacturing process of active substance. Acceptable documents have been provided 
for raw materials including animal derived material of biological origin used in the establishment of cell 
substrate. 
A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB 
and release of future WCBs. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age.

Information on the development genetics including origin of the gene based on the published amino acid 
sequence and DNA sequence of rituximab using polymerase cycling assembly, description of the gene 
construction (components, position, origin, function and reference) and rationale behind the genes construct 
have been provided. In addition, the origin of the CHO cell line used to be transfected has been also described. 
The applicant provided the details on the transfection process. In the context of viral safety the applicant has 
demonstrated that testing of the MCB and WCB is sufficient for product quality. 
The production of the MCB and WCBs is well described. In general terms, the cell banks were extensively 
characterized to confirm their identity, freedom from adventitious agents, and also genetically characterized in 
relation to the integrated recombinant plasmid. All tests were done according to current guidelines, and all the 
results obtained ensure that both banks meet all required specifications.  
The applicant states that the new WCB will be generated by a qualified manufacturer that will be selected in the 
future employing the same or equivalent quality of raw materials, method, controls and tests used to generate 
the 1st WCB. In addition, the newly generated WCB will be appropriately qualified by characterisation and 
testing in accordance with ICH guidelines. Finally, the results will be submitted prior to introduction of the new 
WCB for production, as part of a post-approval variation to the marketing authorisation.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout the 
CT-P10 active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the 
control system in place to monitor and control the drug substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, 
as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are 
specified. 
Sufficient information has been presented to understand the approach followed to establish the manufacturing 
control strategy. Taking account of the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) of CT-P10 finished product, Critical 
Quality Attributes (CQAs), Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and Critical In Process Controls (CIPTs) relating to 
CT-P10 active substance have been defined.  
CQAs were first established using a combination of risk assessment, data from early development, process 
characterization studies and commercial scale production. The in-process controls (CPPs and CIPTs) were 
selected and form part of the control strategy along with the release specifications. 
The types of controls and overall control strategy are appropriate for the control of a monoclonal antibody. The 
control ranges for all the controls (critical and non-critical) have been provided in the application. 
Process validation 
The CT-P10 active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in production 
has been shown on full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters 
and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process 
consistently produces CT-P10 active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined 
specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Several other aspects have also been validated or evaluated, including impurity clearance, resins life time and 
membranes lifetime. Filter validation and in-process hold studies were also carried out.  
Manufacturing process development 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 14/161 
  
  
 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical development 
program. During product development, changes to the manufacturing process have been implemented to 
improve process and product consistency, these have been well documented in the submission.  Appropriate 
product comparability studies have been carried out to demonstrate the process changes have not impacted on 
key product quality attributes.   
Characterisation 
The CT-P10 active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a human IgG-type 
antibody. The primary, secondary, and higher-order structure, post-translational modifications, glycosylation, 
charge variants, purity/impurities, quantity and biological properties were elucidated using orthogonal analytical 
techniques. 
To assess the biological activity of CT-P10, a number of different assays, chosen to represent the putative 
mechanisms of action of rituximab, have been used for characterisation purposes. The applicant demonstrated 
relevant and consistent biological activity of CT-P10 for all batches of active substance and finished product 
tested. In addition, the applicant performed a series of studies of the biological activity of CT-P10 finished 
product relative to the reference product (MabThera and Rituxan) as part of the similarity/comparability 
assessment. Overall, the techniques applied for characterisation on CT-P10 are considered adequate and 
provide a thorough characterisation of the molecule.  
Specification 
The proposed active substance specification includes tests for Colour (Ph. Eur.), Clarity (Ph. Eur.), Visible 
Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Identity, Oligosaccharide Profile, Purity, Residual HCP, Residual Host Cell 
DNA, Residual rProtein A, Protein Concentration, Potency, Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed release specification covers the relevant characteristics of monoclonal antibodies. Acceptance 
limits are well justified and reflect manufacturing experience. The specification is considered appropriate to 
ensure the quality of the active substance.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance manufactured by the development and commercial processes were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process, with 
some minor variations between manufacturing processes already explained in the comparability studies. 
Reference materials 
The history of reference standards used during development was presented. A working reference standard will 
be established post-approval after qualification against the primary reference standard.  
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in 
the proposed container, when protected from light. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 15/161 
  
  
 
Long-term, intermediate and accelerated stability studies have been conducted on representative batches of 
CT-P10 active substance. The parameters tested on stability were a subset of the release specification selected 
for stability indicating properties. The results of the photostability studies suggest the active substance is 
photo-sensitive and should be stored protected from light.  
2.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as sterile solution for injection containing 500 mg of CT-P10 as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium chloride, tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injections.  
The primary packaging is clear Type I glass vials with a butyl rubber stopper and a flip-off seal. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.   
Finished product development 
The development strategy of CT-P10 was focused on developing a similar biological medicinal product 
comparable to the reference medicinal product, MabThera. To this end the finished product formulation used in 
non-clinical and clinical development and which will be used for commercial supply is identical to MabThera (pH 
6.5, 25 mM sodium citrate, 154 mM NaCl, 0.07 % polysorbate 80). Therefore, limited qualitative and 
quantitative formulation studies have been performed, the purpose of which was to demonstrate the formulation 
used was adequately robust in terms of product stability and quality and comparable with MabThera.  
Overall, the chosen formulation showed good stability and similar degradation rates compared to MabThera. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
CT-P10 finished product does not include an overage. A 3% overfill has been justified with a volume of 51.5 mL 
to ensure the required volume for administration can be removed from the vial. 
Manufacturing process development 
The development of the CT-P10 finished product manufacturing process has been described over pilot, clinical 
and proposed commercial scales. Acceptable comparability between these development batches and the 
commercial batches has been demonstrated.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
CT-P10 solution for injection is manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). 
The manufacturing process is standard and well described. It comprises the following steps:  
1.  Preparation of formulation buffer,  
2.  Formulation of active substance,  
3.  Sterile filtration,  
4.  Aseptic filling,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 16/161 
  
  
 
5.  Capping, inspection and storage.  
An appropriate control strategy is in place and has been described in detail with process parameters as well as 
in-process tests/in-process monitoring. A number of questions were raised to clarify specific points. The 
criticality of quality attributes for the CT-P10 finished product manufacturing process has been determined as for 
the active substance using risk assessment and development data as well as commercial scale production data. 
The manufacturing process has been validated. The validation studies confirmed the robustness and consistency 
of the manufacturing process for CT-P10 finished product. Hold times have been validated and shipping 
validation has been completed. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification  
The proposed finished product specification includes tests for Colour (Ph. Eur.), Clarity (Ph. Eur.), Visible 
Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Extractable Volume (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality (Ph. Eur.), Uniformity of Dosage 
Units (Ph. Eur.), Sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.), Identity, Purity, 
Protein Concentration and Potency.  
The end-of-shelf-life specifications are the same as those applied at release. 
The specifications were established based process capability and the analyses of multiple batches of CT-P10 
finished product. The specification is considered appropriate to ensure the quality of the finished product. 
Analytical methods 
The  majority  of  methods  are  used  to  control  both  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  except  for 
Extractable Volume (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality (Ph. Eur.), Uniformity of Dosage Units (Ph. Eur.), Sub-visible particles 
(Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of multiple batches were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. The quality of CT-P10 active substance and finished product is similar 
without additional impurities detected in the CT-P10 finished product. 
Reference materials 
The  reference  standard  used  for  control  of  CT-P10  active  substance  is  also  used  for  the  control  of  CT-P10 
finished product. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of CT-P10 finished product of 3 years when stored at 
2°C - 8°C with the container kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light, is acceptable. 
Furthermore, the prepared infusion solution of rituximab following dilution with 0.9% NaCl has been shown to be 
physically and chemically stable for 24 hours at 2 °C - 8 °C and subsequently 12 hours at room temperature (not 
more than 30 °C). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017

The stability data included long-term and accelerated stability studies, conducted in accordance with the 
relevant ICH guidelines. The parameters tested on stability were as per the release specification. A confirmatory 
photostability study following the ICH guideline Q1B was also performed. The applicant performed a forced 
degradation study in order to characterise and understand the processes and pathways associated with CT-P10 
degradation. An in-use stability study of CT-P10 following dilution in 250 ml of 0.9% w/v sodium chloride (NaCl) 
solution was performed. The results confirmed that the diluted product was physically and chemically stable for 
24 hours at 2 °C - 8 °C and subsequently 12 hours at room temperature (not more than 30 °C). 
Adventitious agents 
Raw materials 
No raw materials of human origin are used during CT-P10 manufacture.  One component of the cell culture 
medium is the only material used during the manufacture of CT-P10 active substance.  An overview of the viral 
safety of raw materials of biological origin used during cell line development and during CT-P10 manufacture 
was presented.  
Cell Banking System 
MCB, WCB, and EPCB were tested for the presence of endogenous and adventitious viruses using validated 
methods. 
Viral Testing of Unprocessed Bulk 
Adventitious viruses were not detected in any of the harvest lots tested. Retrovirus-like particles for 
unprocessed bulk were not detected by TEM above the limit of detection of the assay. 
Virus Clearance Study 
The Virus Clearance Study was considered adequate. The raw data of this study was requested during the 
procedure and have been provided.  
Biosimilarity 
CT-P10 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the EU reference product MabThera 
(rituximab) for intravenous (IV) use, which is also marketed under the name Rituxan in the US. CT-P10 finished 
product was designed to be highly similar to its reference medicinal product, MabThera. CT-P10 and MabThera 
are identical with respect to pharmaceutical form, concentration and composition, and route of administration. 
CT-P10 solution for injection contains 500 mg rituximab per vial which is identical to the content of both 
MabThera and Rituxan. 
A step-wise approach has been taken with respect to the demonstration of similarity of CT-P10 to MabThera, 
starting with a comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterization of CT-P10 relative to its reference 
product. This similarity exercise was undertaken, not only to demonstrate the similarity of CT-P10 to MabThera, 
but also to demonstrate the similarity of Rituxan to MabThera, in order to support the global registration of 
CT-P10 in the future. 
The applicant has performed a large number and wide range of orthogonal, highly sensitive test methods to 
provide  a  demonstration  of  similarity.  The  similarity  studies  included  an  extensive  comparative  analysis  of 
primary, secondary and tertiary structure, glycan profiles and of post translational modifications. In addition, 
biological  assays  were  included  to  evaluate  similarity  in  all  biological  activities  associated  with  known  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 18/161 
  
  
 
putative  functions  and  therapeutic  effects.  The  analytical  methods  and  biological  assays  used  in  similarity 
studies have been suitably validated or qualified to provide a high level of assurance that the methods could 
detect any slight differences and are scientifically sound, fit for purpose, reliable and reproducible. 
 Representative  batches  of  CT-P10  finished  product,  MabThera  and  Rituxan  were  analysed  to  assess  the 
similarity between CT-P10, MabThera and Rituxan. All MabThera batches were sourced from the EU while all 
Rituxan batches were sourced from the US. The batches of CT-P10, MabThera, and Rituxan were chosen to 
reflect a range of expiration dates and product ages. All batches were within the shelf life at the time of testing 
and were stored and handled as recommended in the labelling. 
It was considered that a sufficient number of batches from CT-P10, MabThera and Rituxan had been chosen and 
the tests panels were extensive. A justification for the use of only CT-P10 finished product batches based on 
feedback from CHMP Scientific Advice was accepted. In addition, any deviation from the advice given by the EU 
authorities was adequately justified.  
The results of the 3-way comparability study presented by the applicant show that CT-P10 and 
MabThera/Rituxan can be considered similar in terms of structure and biological activity. Identical primary 
structure was shown using methods such as amino acid analysis, molar absorptivity, N-terminal sequencing, 
C-terminal sequencing, peptide mapping, and determination of intact mass. Highly similar secondary and higher 
order structure was shown using methods such as Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), Circular 
Dichroism (CD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Similar post-translational modifications included 
deamidation, oxidation and C-terminal lysine variants, similar number and distribution of charged variants and 
highly similar glycosylation profiles, highly similar monosaccharide (Fucose, N-acetyglucosamine, Galactose and 
Mannose) sugar contents and sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA)) contents and similar levels of 
residual process-related impurities (such as host cell protein, Host Cell DNA and rProtein A) were shown.  
Some slight differences were observed which were shown not to have any impact on biological activity, safety or 
PK, and therefore they are considered acceptable.  
Highly similar binding affinity to CD20 (the primary mechanism of action of rituximab) and highly similar 
biological activities in assays representative of the known and putative mechanisms of action of Rituximab, 
namely, CDC, ADCC, apoptosis, C1q binding affinity, Fcγ receptors (FcγRIIIa-V, FcγRIIIa-F, FcγRIIIb, FcγRIIa, 
FcγRIIb and FcγRI) binding affinity and FcRn binding affinity was shown. A similar correlation between 
glycosylation and Fc function of CT-P10 and MabThera/Rituxan was also shown. 
Comparative forced degradation studies of CT-P10 and MabThera/Rituxan were performed. The degradation 
profiles of CT-P10 and MabThera/Rituxan were shown to be comparable. 
Comparative stability testing was performed. The results of stability testing did not reveal any differences that 
could have implications for the safety or efficacy of CT-P10.  
Before concluding on the biosimilarity of the three products the CHMP requested additional information and/or 
clarification from the applicant.  
The applicant provided more information about the age/shelf-life of the batches used in the biosimilarity 
assessment and it demonstrated that the age of the batches has no effect on the quality profile of CT-P10 
compared to MabThera and Rituxan. 
The applicant reconfirmed that the number, distribution and molecular variants of IEC-HPLC peak fractions were 
conserved and the biological activities of the peak fractions were similar among the fully characterised CT-P10, 
MabThera and Rituxan lots, consistent with the results previously reported in the initial dossier. 
Assessment report

The applicant performed an evaluation of functional assays, potency and binding affinity related to putative 
mechanisms of action (apoptosis, CDC and ADCP) using different samples obtained from NHL and CLL patients 
to support the extrapolation of the clinical results obtained from the rheumatoid arthritis indication to other 
indications of MabThera authorised in the EU. 
The applicant demonstrated similar biological activities for CT-P10 and MabThera in assays representative of the 
known and putative mechanisms of action of Rituximab, regardless of the source of cells. These data suggest 
that CT-P10 and MabThera will have highly similar therapeutic effects across all indications for which MabThera 
is approved in the EU. 
In conclusion, the full set of biosimilarity data presented is considered appropriate. The biosimilarity of CT-P10 
to the EU reference product (MabThera) has been demonstrated at the quality level. Any minor differences 
observed have been adequately justified. In addition, based on analytical bridging data, the US comparator 
product Rituxan is considered representative of the EU reference product MabThera. 
2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
CT-P10 has been developed as a biosimilar to the EU reference product MabThera. Overall, similarity between 
CT-P10 and the EU reference product MabThera is considered demonstrated at the quality level. Any minor 
differences observed have been adequately justified. In addition, based on analytical bridging data, the US 
comparator product Rituxan is considered representative of the EU reference product MabThera. 
2.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of CT-P10 is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the 
SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have 
been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety.

Cross reactivity assessment of CT-P10 and MabThera in human tissues (GLP compliant) 
A cross-reactivity study was carried out with the aim of compare the reactivity of CT-P10 and MabThera in 
human tissues. The samples were obtained from three unrelated donors and tonsil tissue was selected as 
positive control. The results showed a very similar staining profile for both products in tissues expressing CD20 
(tonsil, lymph node, thymus and spleen).  
Unspecific binding in white matter and peripheral nerve was recorded. Nuclear staining was considered 
non-relevant due to nuclei were not accessible in in vivo studies.  
In vivo pharmacodynamics effects of CT-P10 and MabThera in cynomolgus monkeys (GLP compliant) 
The in vivo pharmacological activity of CT-P10 was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals received 
intravenously CT-P10 or MabThera during 8 weeks on a weekly basis (20 mg/Kg/week). A similar effect in terms 
of B-cells depletion was observed in both treatments. CT-P10 induced changes in the mesenteric lymph nodes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 25/161 
  
  
 
 
 
 
and spleens of males and females. In the case of animals treated with MabThera, similar changes were observed 
in mesenteric lymph nodes, although only in the spleens of males. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed, which is acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology related parameters were incorporated in the repeated dose toxicology study. In this study, 
no treatment related findings (electrocardiography, body temperature) were reported. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were performed which is acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
8-week GLP Repeat iv Dose Toxicokinetic Study in Cynomolgus Monkey using CT-P10 (rituximab) 
and MabThera (rituximab)  
This study compared the toxicokinetics of CT-P10 and Mabthera to establish that the products had similar TK 
parameters (Cmax, AUC0-168h, C168, Tmax). Blood samples were taken on Day 1 and Day 22 from 3 males 
and 3 female cynomolgus monkeys to CT-P10 or MabThera after weekly IV administration (bolus) at 20 
mg/kg/week. One male in CT-P10 group and 1 male and 2 females in MabThera group were excluded from the 
PK assessment due to the detection of anti-drug antibody production on Day 22. Among them, 1 male and 1 
female in Mabthera group were prematurely sacrificed (on Days 36 and 29 respectively) due to adverse clinical 
signs.

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No comparative single-dose toxicity study was submitted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Key Parameters in the toxicokinetic study described under Pharmacokinetics were Clinical condition, 
bodyweight, ophthalmoscopy, body temperature, electrocardiography, haematology, blood chemistry, 
toxicokinetics, immunogenicity, immunophenotyping and pharmacodynamics, urinalysis, organ weight, 
macropathology and histopathology. 
Key Findings Once-weekly administration of CT-P10 to cynomolgus monkeys for 5 weeks in female and 6 weeks 
in male produced no adverse toxicological findings and with the exceptions of the 2 decedents in animals 
receiving Mabthera responded to treatment in a generally similar manner. 
Two deaths were reported for animals dosed with Mabthera (one female on Day 29 and one male on Day 36) 
receiving MabThera. Following the 4th dose (Day 22)  effects reported (one female) included hunched posture, 
underactivity, piloerection, body tremors and bruising and/or swelling on the wrists, ankles, face, muzzle, 
shoulders and tail with additional findings after the 5th dose (Day 29) including vomiting, unresponsiveness, 
salivation, partially closed eyelids and unsteadiness. The animal was administered oxygen to regain 
consciousness and briefly showed recovery, but further deterioration prompted the early sacrifice of this animal. 
Haematology data (Day 24 and 28) revealed low haematocrit, haemoglobin and red blood cell counts for this 
animal. In contrast to the lower white blood cell counts observed on Day 3 and 24 and low platelet count on Day 
24, a significant increase in these cell types was shown on Day 28. At necropsy pale kidneys were observed and 
with higher weight. Liver and spleen weights slightly higher than control were also recorded. The only clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 27/161 
  
  
 
 
 
findings in the remaining animals receiving Mabthera was piloerection for 1 male on Day 1 and vomiting for 1 
female on Day 22. 
There were no clear effect on bodyweight and temperature for animals receiving treatment with CT-P10 or 
MabThera over the treatment period. Also, there were no treatment related finding in ophthalmoscopy and 
electrocardiography. 
Anti-drug antibody determination follows a multi-tiered assay approach - screening, confirmation and 
neutralisation assay. In the screening step, results were segregated as to whether they were below the cut point 
(reported as negative) or equal to or above the cut point (potentially positive). Of the 53 samples analysed, 4 
samples for anti-CT-P10 and 6 samples for anti-Mabthera provided positive results (Screening Analysis), all the 
samples were confirmed positive during immunocompetition analyses (Confirmatory Analysis). 
The determination of neutralising anti-drug antibodies in 17 cynomolgus monkey serum samples (10 positive 
with their corresponding 7 pre-treatment samples) analysed after receiving CT-P10/Mabthera was carried out. 
Of 10 positive samples, 4 samples from 3 animals for anti-CT-P10 (2 female at Week 7 and 1 male at Day 22 and 
Week 8) and 5 samples from 3 animals for anti-Mabthera (1 female at Day 22 and Week 7, 1 female at Day 22 
and Day 29 terminal sporadic sample and 1 male at Day 22) were tested positive. One sample for anti- Mabthera 
(1 male at Week 8) was tested negative despite screening positive. Pre-treatment samples were negative. The 
neutralising anti-drug antibodies values were of a similar magnitude for those testing positive for either CT-P10 
or Mabthera. 
The total number of B-cells in the peripheral blood was significantly reduced for both compounds, consistent 
with the expected pharmacological activity of rituximab. After 14 days recovery B-cells increased slightly but 
reversal was not complete. The total number of NK cells appeared to decrease in the peripheral blood of females 
treated with CT-P10 but not in males or either sex receiving Mabthera. The total number of B-cells in the spleen, 
lymph node and bone marrow were also very reduced, and more evident in the lymph node. No other changes 
were observed in these lymphoid tissues. Immunophenotyping results were similar between animals 
administered CT-P10 or Mabthera, with lower than control and pre-treatment B-cell numbers observed in the 
peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. The significance of the observed decrease in NK cell 
numbers in the peripheral blood of females receiving CT-P10 is unclear, and was the only difference noted 
between the 2 treatments. 
Decrease in total and differential white blood cell counts was observed for animals receiving CT-P10 or Mabthera 
after the first dose, with the effect predominantly due to lower lymphocyte counts (0.42-0.5 X control for both 
sexes receiving CT-P10 or Mabthera). During Week 4, lower lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil 
counts were recorded for females receiving CT-P10 or Mabthera (total counts 0.63 X and 0.5 X control for 
CT-P10 and Mabthera respectively). For males, the only significant difference from controls was lower neutrophil 
counts for animals receiving Mabthera (0.48 X control). In week 7 for females and week 8 for males 
haematological assessment (2 weeks after the last dose) the effects on white blood cells were not observed. 
Slightly lower group mean lymphocyte populations for females receiving CT-P10 and lower neutrophil counts for 
males receiving Mabthera were observed, but were restricted to one sex. 
Low cholesterol levels was seen in females receiving CT-P10 on Day 3 and in Week 7 (0.82 and 0.78 X 
respectively) and to a lesser extent for females receiving Mabthera in Week 7 (0.86 X control) finding considered 
to have no toxicological significance. In Week 8 low phosphorus levels in males were reported for both 
compounds and only slight reduction was seen on day 3 (0.84 X control) but without statistical significance.

At the end of the treatment (Week 7 for females and Week 8 for males)higher organ weight was seen in female 
kidneys for both compounds (1.2 X and 1.3 X control respectively), and concomitant slightly high individual 
thymus weights for both sexes and compounds.  
At the end of the treatment period, histopathologic changes considered to be related to treatment with CT-P10 
were seen in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of males and females. Changes related to treatment with 
Mabthera were also seen in the mesenteric lymph nodes of males and females but only in the spleens of males 
There were no treatment-related effects on body weight, urinalysis, ophthalmology, body temperature, 
electrocardiography, macroscopic pathology, or injection site assessments (gross and histopathological 
assessments). 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted as it is not a requirement for biosimilar products (see discussion 
on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Tissues from reproductive organs were evaluated in terms of macroscopic and microscopic histopathology in the 
8-week repeat-dose toxicity study. Lower group mean uterus and cervix weights were recorded for treated 
female animals, but were largely attributable to a high value in the control group. No treatment-related 
histopathology changes were noted in reproductive organs. However studies regarding safety reproduction 
toxicology are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars.  
Toxicokinetic data 
See study resultsdescribed above. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance at the injection site was assessed in the repeat-dose toxicity study as part of the gross pathology 
and histopathology evaluations. In the 8-week repeat-dose toxicity study, there were no toxicologically 
significant differences in injection site findings between treatment groups. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies have been performed. Similarity analyses of antigenicity and immune function, such as 
ADCC and CDC have been assessed in the in vitro PD studies. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant provided a justification for not submitting any environmental risk assessment studies based on 
the fact that Blitzima is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment which is in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 29/161 
  
  
 
 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).  
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The comparability assessment between CT-P10 and MabThera was carried out in accordance with EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). In this regard, potential difference in biological activity (see Quality aspects) 
was evaluated in in vitro relevant assays by each product. They comprised binding to target antigen (CD20); 
binding to representative isoforms of the relevant three Fc gamma receptors (FcγRI, FcRII and FcRIII), FcRn and 
complement (C1q); Fab-associated functions; and Fc-associated functions (ADCC, CDC and complement 
activation). No significant differences were reported in the above mentioned parameters.  
Given the absence of in vitro biological difference, no in vivo studies should have been considered necessary 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). However, planning for MAA submissions in non-EU countries, the Applicant 
conducted an in vivo pharmacodynamic study in cynomolgus monkeys, which resulted in no difference between 
CT-P10 and MabThera in terms of pharmacodynamic actions.  
The absence of studies into distribution, metabolism, excretion and drug-drug interactions was consistent with 
CHMP guidance (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010 Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies). Furthermore studies regarding safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and 
carcinogenicity are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars (See  EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) 
The kinetics data was obtained from one 8-week repeat-dose intravenous toxicity study and toxicokinetic study 
with CTP10 and MabThera in cynomolgus monkey. Three animals per group were allocated. The Cmax values of 
CT-P10 in monkeys on day one were similar to those values observed in the animals receiving MabThera 
although on Day 22 (with no evidence of anti-drug antibodies), a 40% lower Cmax was reported in CT-P10 
females while in males was 30% higher. Exposure levels were rather comparable on Day 1 although by day 22 
was 1.6-fold higher in CT-P10 males and in females was about 65% lower than females receiving MabThera. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that body surface area (BSA) and gender were the most 
significant covariates to explain inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for 
BSA, male subjects had a larger volume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- 
related pharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment was not 
required. Tmax was generally identified for both MabThera and CT-P10 at 15 min post dose.   
Limited data were available for terminal half-life assessment (only one animal) on day one with a value of 83 
hours. Values were much lower after 22 days (three animals) ranging from 26-45 h for CT-P10 group and 45 h 
for MabThera (one animal).  
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were submitted for CT-P10 in line with the ICH S6 (R1) Guideline 
(2011) which states that such studies are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-derived products because 
large proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, would not be expected to pass through cell membranes and 
interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. Moreover such studies are not needed for biosimilars 
(see EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
The product is exempted from  the submission of  environmental risk assessment studies based on the fact that 
it is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment; this is in accordance with the 
CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured in studies CT-P10 1.1. and CT-P10 3.2. 
Analytical methods 
CT-P10  and  Mabthera  are  quantitatively  measured  directly 
from  human  serum  using  an 
electrochemiluminescent  (ECL)  immunoassay  following  a  1:25  dilution  in  assay  buffer  containing  3  %  BSA, 
human serum samples containing CT-P10 or rituximab. 
STUDY CT-P10 1.1  
This  was  a  Phase  1,  randomized,  controlled,  multicenter,  2-arm,  parallel-group,  double-blind  study  to 
demonstrate the equivalence of CT-P10 to MabThera with respect to the pharmacokinetic profile in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For study description see Clinical efficacy. 
The primary PK parameters were: 
•  AUC0-last: calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule over both infusions of the first treatment course 
from the start of the 1st infusion to the last quantifiable concentration 
•  Cmax: calculated after the second infusion of the Core Study Period 
Other PK parameters were Cmax (after first infusion in the Core Study Period), Tmax (both after first and second 
infusion in the Core Study Period), Ctrough (prior to second infusion in the Core Study Period), Vd, CL, and t 1/2 
(after second infusion in the Core Study Period), Cmin (prior to Extension Study Period), Ctrough (prior to second 
infusion in the Extension Study Period).

The PK sampling time points were selected based on the mean rituximab terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) 
ranging from 17 to 23 days except for CLL indication with 32 days (Mabthera SmPC 2015). The choice of an 
interval of 24 weeks would correspond to approximately 7 half-lives (see above the median terminal half-life) 
and would allow covering at least 80% of the AUC. 
A total of 154 patients were randomly assigned to study drug: 103 patients and 51 patients in the CT-P10 and 
MabThera treatment arms, respectively. Of these, 153 patients initiated study drug treatment due to one patient 
in the CT-P10 treatment arm having poor venous access. 
Although 137 patients completed the study, 141 patients were used since the following criteria were satisfied: 
sufficient blood concentration data was available to compute at least 1 of the PK parameters up to Core Week 
16; and a pre-dose sample at their Core Week 2 (Day 14) visit was available. This population was the primary 
population for the summary and analysis of PK data. 
Overall, demographic characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms. The mean age of the 
population was 50 years and there were fewer male patients (12%) than female patients (88%). The majority 
of patients were white (68). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.The duration of RA disease was similar 
between the 2 treatment arms: 11 years in the CT-P10 arm and 10 years in the MabThera arm. Most patients 
had received only one prior TNF inhibitor (84%) and the reason for stopping it was mainly therapeutic failure 
(92%).  The  most  frequently  used  products  were  adalimumab,  infliximab,  and  etanercept.  The  duration  of 
previous anti-TNF use was 21 months on average (See Clinical efficacy section). 
All patients took MTX and folic acid during the study, as per the study design and requirements. The mean ± SD 
dose of MTX taken during the study was similar between the 2 treatment arms: 15.34 ± 4.82 mg/week and 
15.59 ± 4.32 mg/week in the CT-P10 and MabThera arms, respectively. 
All  patients  also  took  analgesics,  systemic  corticosteroids  (100%  in  the  CT-P10  and  98%  in  the  reference 
product 
arms, 
respectively), 
antihistamines 
(88% 
and 
90%, 
respectively), 
and 
other 
anti-inflammatory/antirheumatic products (80% and 82%, respectively).

A new PK analysis using all concentration data available from all patients having been administered 2,000 mg of 
rituximab was conducted which showed that the 90%CIs of all the PK parameters were within the acceptance 
limits with ratios close to 100.  
Secondary PK Parameters 
Serum secondary PK parameters for rituximab are summarized up to Week 24 in the Core Study Period for the 
PK population in the following table.

The tertiary PK endpoints were Cmin immediately before the start of first infusion in the Extension Study Period 
and Ctrough prior to the second infusion of the Extension Study Period. 
The geometric means for Cmin were 0.04 μg/mL and 0.03 μg/mL and for Ctrough were 71.12 μg/mL and 78.36 
μg/mL in CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively.  
Additional  PK  parameters  analysed  from  the  Extension  Study,  Cmax,  after  the  first  infusion  were:  (Cmax,  1) 
(286.47 μg/mL and 331.86 μg/mL in CT-P10 and  Mabthera groups, respectively) and Cmax after the second 
infusion  in  the  Extension  Study  Period  (424.12  μg/mL  and  431.07  μg/mL  in  CT-P10  and  Mabthera  groups, 
respectively). 
STUDY CT-P10 3.2;  
This ongoing study was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, 3-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, prospective, 
Phase 3 study was designed to demonstrate similar pharmacokinetics in terms of (AUC0-last), AUC from time 0 
extrapolated  to  infinity  over  both  doses  of  the  first  treatment  course  (AUC0-∞),  and  observed  maximum 
concentration (Cmax) after the second infusion between CT-P10, Rituxan, and MabThera in patients with active 
RA who were concomitantly treated with methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid during the first treatment course 
(over the first 24 weeks). Change from baseline in disease activity measured by Disease Activity Score using 28 
joint counts (DAS28) (C-reactive protein [CRP]) at Week 24 was the primary efficacy parameter.  
Overall Study Schematic 
Each course consisted of 2 infusions: a dose of 1,000 mg of CT-P10, Mabthera or Rituxan (IV) separated by a 
2-week interval. In the third treatment course (1 additional course in the Extension Study Period), patients who 
received  Rituxan  in  the  Main  Study  Period  will  be  re-randomised to  either  the  Rituxan  or  CT-P10  treatment 
groups and patients who received Mabthera in the Main Study Period will be switched to CT-P10 while patients 
who received CT-P10 will remain in CT-P10 group. 
The main criteria for inclusion were male or female patients between 18 and 75 years old, inclusive, who had 
been  diagnosed  with  rheumatoid  arthritis  according to  the  revised  1987  American  College  of  Rheumatology 
(ACR) classification criteria for at least 6 months prior to randomization. 
The following PK Parameters were determined as primary and secondary endpoints in Part 1 and Part 2.

A total of 372 male and female patients with RA were enrolled; 189 patients were included in Part 1 and 1:1:1 
randomised into the CT-P10, Mabthera and the Rituxan group.  
The PK population for the first treatment course consisted of all patients who received at least 1 full dose (1000 
mg) of study drug and provided at least 1 post-treatment PK concentration results during the first treatment 
course.

STUDY CT-P10 3.3  
This study was a Phase 1/3, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind study to demonstrate 
equivalence of pharmacokinetics and non-inferiority of efficacy for CT-P10 in comparison with Rituxan, each 
administered  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  vincristine  and  prednisone  (CVP)  in  patients  with 
Advanced Follicular Lymphoma (AFL). 
The main criteria for inclusion was male or female patients 18 years or older, with a histologically confirmed FL 
of grade 1 to 3a (according to the World Health Organization 2008 classification), at least 1 measurable tumor 
mass that had not previously been irradiated, confirmed CD20+ lymphoma, Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease,

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, 
and renal function reserve. 
Patients were to receive up to 8 cycles of study treatment (duration of each cycle was 21 days) in the Core Study 
Period and 12 cycles of study treatment (duration of each cycle was 2 months) in the Maintenance Study Period. 
Up to Core Cycle 4 (over 12 weeks), CT-P10 or Rituxan 375 mg/m2 were administered as an IV infusion on Day 
1 of each cycle, and CVP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 [up to a maximum of 2 mg] 
IV, prednisone 40 mg/m2 oral) were administered during the Core Study Period. CT-P10 or Rituxan (375 mg/m2 
IV) was administered alone as maintenance in patients who have a response during the Core Study Period. 
One  hundred  twenty-one  (121)  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  study  drug  and  initiated  core  study 
treatment (59 patients and 62 patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). 
The majority of patients in each treatment group completed up to and including Core Cycle 4 in the study (55 
[93.2%] patients and 58 [93.5%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). The most 
frequently reported reason for discontinuation from the Core Study Period was progressive disease (2 [3.4%] 
patients and 1 [1.6%] patient in the CT–P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). One patient died due 
to  AE  (reported  as  tumor  lysis  syndrome)  in  the  CT-P10  treatment  group.  In  addition,  another  patient who 
entered follow-up period died due to progress disease. 
The  PK  population  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  (full)  of  study  drug  (CT-P10  or 
Rituxan) and who had at least 1 post-treatment PK result and who did not have any major protocol deviation 
(Section 9.7.1.3) that was relevant to the PK endpoint.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human IgG1 monoclonal antibody with murine heavy and light-chain variable 
regions (Fab domain) and human kappa (light chain) and gamma-1 (heavy chain) constant regions (Fc domain). 
The biological function of rituximab is mediated by the two functional domains of the antibody: the Fab domain 
of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B-cells and the Fc domain can recruit immune effector functions to 
mediate B-cell lysis. The proposed mechanisms by which rituximab promotes B-cell lysis, supported by in vitro 
data,  are  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  by  NK  cells,  antibody-dependent  cellular 
phagocytosis  (ADCP)  by  macrophages  and  neutrophils,  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  and 
apoptosis  induced  by  activation  of  signalling  pathways.  In  summary,  the  primary  mechanism  of  action  of 
rituximab can be attributed to Fc and/or F(ab)2 functionality as either F(ab)2 mediated (induction of apoptosis 
of CD20+ B-cells), or Fc mediated (ADCC, ADCP, CDC). 
All of these pathways are likely active in the clinical setting but their relative contribution to the overall depletion 
of  B-cell  numbers  and  therapeutic  efficacy  of  rituximab  is  unclear.  The  extent  to  which  each  of  these 
mechanisms  of  action  can  contribute  to  B-cell  elimination  in  autoimmune  and  lympho-proliferative  diseases 
depends  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  CD20  expression,  tumour  localisation,  complement  levels,  free 
plasma  IgGs,  the  extent  and  status  of  tumour  infiltration  by  immune  effector  cells  such  as  NK  cells, 
macrophages and neutrophils. 
In addition to the four mechanisms described, evidence suggests that rituximab may induce an anti-tumour 
response by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Rituximab-induced killing of malignant  B-cells can result in release of 
tumour antigens into adjacent tissue causing local inflammation. Such an environment promotes the uptake of 
tumour-associated antigens by dendritic cells and cross-presentation to T-lymphocytes, providing the potential 
for cell-mediated immunity. The binding to CD20 is mediated via the Fab domain of rituximab and the Fc domain 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 41/161 
  
  
 
 
 
can recruit immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated cell lysis 
include  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  resulting  from  C1q  binding,  antibody-dependent  cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by 1 or more of the Fcγ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, macrophages 
and NK cells, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
STUDY CT-P10 1.1  and CT-P10 1.3 
The PD effect of rituximab on B-cell count (measured by flow cytometry), which directly reflects its activity, was 
evaluated in Study CT-P10 1.1 and its open-label extension CT-P10 1.3. 
Figure 4: Spaghetti Plots of B-cell Counts up to Week 48 of Core Study Period in 
Study CT-P10 1.1: PD Population 
The mean baseline B-cell count was higher in the CP-T10 than in the MabThera arm. In all patients, the B-cell 
count was below LLoQ (20 cells/ μL) by the next time point, i.e. usually the end of the infusion, or 24 hours after 
the start of the infusion at the latest. Total depletion was observed in all patients for 16 weeks. 
The proportion of patients achieving B-cell recovery (i.e. ≥lower limit of normal (LLN) of 110 cells/µL or at least 
50% of the baseline value) was presented up to Core Week 48 in patients who did not receive a second 
treatment course (post-hoc analysis).

Initial results from study CT-P10 3.2, showed that B-cell counts from all patients, except 1 in CT-P10 group, 
decreased to below the LLoQ (20 cells/μL) immediately after the 1st infusion and then remained below this level 
up to Week 24 in the majority of patients in all treatment groups. Updated data over the main study period (up

to  week  48)  showed  that  study  CT-P10  3.2  involved  systematic  retreatment  at  week  24,  except  for  safety 
reasons (which occurred in 4 patients; 1%).  
The  proportion  of  patients  that  completed  two  treatment  courses  was  87%  (CT-P10),  89%  (Rituxan);  93% 
(MabThera). The main reason for discontinuation, especially for CT-P10, was withdrawal of consent.   
KM time to event analysis of Part 1 (with the event being first B-cell value above LLoQ, or discontinuation for lack 
of efficacy, or disease progression excluding time to re-treatment,) showed a trend for earlier B-cell recovery 
with CT-P10 compared to MabThera and Rituxan. While the proportion of patients with B-cell recovery before 
week 48 was higher with Rituxan (31%) than CT-P10 (22%), it occurred in the majority of the cases at week 24 
with Rituxan and at earlier time points with CT-P10. The proportion of patients with B-cell recovery was the 
lowest with MabThera (17%).

(20 cells/μL) 1 hour after the end of infusion at Core Cycle 1 and remained at the LLoQ pre-dose levels at each 
subsequent cycle for the majority of patients up to and including Cycle 8 (over 24 weeks) in the Core Study 
Period. A similar trend was observed for mean B-cell counts in both treatment groups up to Core Cycle 8.

There were few patients whose B-cell counts fluctuated during the treatment cycles but most of the values 
decreased again. There were 3 patients in CT-P10 group who had B-cell counts of 23 cells/μL at Core Cycle 4, 33 
cells/μL at Core Cycle 6 and 24 cells/μL at Core Cycle 7, respectively. All of these patients’ B-cell counts 
decreased to LLoQ at subsequent cycles and showed overall responses up to Core Cycle 8. There were no 
patients showing B-cell recovery throughout 24-week study period.  
Immunogenicity 
The updated immunogenicity database in the CT-P10 clinical development programme consists of 666 RA and 
NHL patients. Of those patients with RA, 283 patients treated with CT-P10 and 262 patients treated with 
MabThera/Rituxan have been assessed for immunogenicity up to 104 weeks including 20 patients who were 
treated with both CT-P10 and MabThera in Study CT-P10 1.1 and its open-label maintenance study (CT-P10 
1.3). In AFL patients, 70 patients treated with CT-P10 and 70 patients with Rituxan have been assessed for 
immunogenicity up to and including Core cycle 8 (over 24 weeks). In CT-P10 clinical development programme,

the presences of ADAs and/or NAbs were determined using state-of-art and validated immunoassays across the 
CT-P10 RA and AFL studies. 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, the ADA incidence from week 24 onwards and the proportion of patients who 
seroconverted after 1-2 treatment courses were comparable in both treatment arms. However, there was a 
difference in the kinetic profile with ADAs detected earlier in the CT-P10 arm than in the MabThera arm: 10% vs. 
2%, respectively, at week 16 (when considering only evaluable samples with low drug concentration). 
There was one patient who had considerably higher level of ADA and NAb titre throughout the 1st and 2nd 
treatment courses in Study CT-P10 1.1. with no drug detectable in his serum and experienced, a moderate 
(grade 3) event of infusion related reaction after the 2nd infusion of the 2nd treatment course, however this 
patient continued in the study up to Extension Week 24 and showed moderate EULAR responses during both the 
1st and 2nd treatment courses. Therefore the presence of ADA in this patient did not appear to have an overt 
impact on treatment efficacy and did not result in treatment discontinuation. Moreover most of the ADA positive 
responses were non-neutralizing in nature and did not have an overt clinical meaningful impact as demonstrated 
further in the analyses of PK, PD, efficacy and safety by ADA status or seroconversion status.  
In Study CT-P10 1.1, a small numerical trend in the number of ADA positive patients at baseline 3/102 (22.5%) 
patients and 7/51 (13.7%) patients in the CT-P10 and MabThera groups, respectively, was observed and the 
ADA method was further optimised and modified following extensive investigations. In Studies CT-P10 3.2 and 
CT-P10 3.3 using a modified ADA method, reduced rates of baseline ADA positivity were observed and the ADA 
results were similar between the treatment groups in the Phase 3 studies. 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, the immunogenicity rate at week 24, in the randomised part 1 of the study, the ADA 
incidence in the CT-P10 arm was 13.6% in the MabThera arm it was 27.6% and in the Rituxan arm 23.3%. One 
patient had a high titre and neutralising ADA response, which resulted in lower exposure, failure to achieve 
adequate B-cell depletion, one infusion-related reaction, and moderate EULAR response but poor ACR response. 
This case was thoroughly investigated and the observed response was considered likely to be a conjunction of 
various factors (Sjogren´s syndrome and an FF FcγRIIIa genotype) that may have had a role in the immune and 
PD response.  
Due to different study design, only results up to Week 24 can be compared between study 1.1 and 3.2 (Part 1). 
In study CT-P10 1.1 ADAs were detected earlier with CT-P10 and the incidence rate was similar at Week 24 
(19%) to that of MabThera (20%). In study 3.2 (Part 1) ADAs were detected earlier and their incidence at Week 
24 was higher with both reference products (28% and 23%) compared to CT-P10 (14%). Importantly, in study 
3.2, the ADA incidences were the same after the first and second treatment course.  
In addition, the potential impact of ADA presence on PK and efficacy, the primary PK endpoints (AUC0-last, 
AUC0-inf and/or Cmax), DAS28 score and ACR response were assessed by ADA positive and negative subset in 
Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 3.2. With regards to PK, the analyses concluded that ADA presence resulted in 
the reduced drug exposure but this impact was similar between CT-P10 and the reference products, MabThera 
and/or Rituxan. For efficacy, there was no clear trend observed in change from baseline of DAS28 score and ACR 
response at Week 24 between ADA positive and negative subset with virtually no difference between CTP10 and 
the reference products groups. 
In Study CT-P10 3.3, immunogenicity data in 140 AFL patients indicates very low ADA incidence compared to 
CT-P10 RA studies. The proportions of patients with positive results for ADA up to Core Cycle 4 at post treatment 
visits were similar between the 2 treatment groups: 3/70 (4.3%) patients and 2/70(2.9%) patients in the 
CT-P10 and Rituxan group, respectively. All the ADA positive patients had positive for NAb with the exception of 
one patient in CT-P10 group. Because of higher drug concentrations and immunosuppression, immunogenicity 
Assessment report

Page 49/161 
  
  
 
results in study CT-P10 3.3 are not particularly helpful for the comparability exercise; nevertheless, ADA 
incidence was broadly comparable under CT-P10 and Rituxan. 
In CT-P10 3.3 (Part 1), due to the limited number of patients with ADA positive results, PK similarity was 
evaluated only in the ADA negative subset and a trend of lower exposure in terms of AUCtau and Cmax,ss was 
detected in the ADA positive subset with similar extents between the CT-P10 and Rituxan groups. 
The impact of ADAs on exposure to rituximab appeared similar with both products. Based on current analyses, 
ADAs did not seem to influence PD, efficacy or safety parameters in most patients.

In general, the Applicant´s development program to demonstrate the similarity between CT-P10 and Mabthera 
with respect to the pharmacokinetic (PK) is considered adequate and was performed according to the guidance 
on biosimilars and the recommendations given in the CHMP Scientific Advice.  
In general, the design to evaluate pharmacokinetic equivalence of CT-P10 and Mabthera primarily in patients 
with RA (CT-P10 1.1) is considered appropriate. The studied population is considered appropriate for an initial 
investigation of PK because it is homogeneous in terms of target amount (B-cells) and is in line with the CHMP 
Scientific Advice. In addition to the completed Phase 1 studies, data from the first analysis of the ongoing Phase 
3 studies has submitted: CT-P10 3.2 in RA patients (including primary PK and efficacy assessments up to Week 
24) and CT-P10 3.3 in AFL patients (including primary PK assessment up to Core Cycle 4 [12 weeks]). The study 
CT-P10 3.3 in AFL patients was submitted as a supportive study to cover an oncology indication in line with the 
CHMP Scientific Advice. 
The analytical method is acceptable and its validation reasonable. An unexpected level (about 30%) of baseline 
samples was found to be above the LLOQ of 0.02 μg/mL. This was further investigated and may be due to the 
presence  of  pre-existing  HAMAs.  Although  the  Applicant’s  assumption  was  not  formally  confirmed  by  the 
detection of HAMAs in the positive baseline samples, the assay was modified for the Phase III studies by the 
addition  of  mouse  IgG  in  order  to  bind  HAMAs  if  present  in  the  sample.  The  proportion  of  positive  baseline 
samples was greatly reduced by this method, which indirectly indicates that HAMAs may be at least one of the 
interfering factors. 
For  study  CT-P10  1.1,  additional  PK  analysis  was  conducted  using  all  concentration  data  available  from  all 
patients having been administered 2,000 mg of rituximab. The new PK analysis includes geometric LS (least 
squares) means, ratios and 90% CI of the primary PK endpoints (Cmax after the 2nd infusion and AUC0-last) along 
with  additional  key  PK  parameters,  i.e.  AUC0-t,  AUCt-inf,  Cmax  after  the  1st  infusion  and  Ctrough  after  the  1st 
infusion. This analysis showed that the 90%CIs of all the PK parameters were within the acceptance limits with 
ratios close to 100, therefore, these results fully support biosimilarity. This is further supported by consistent 
and  similar  results  from  Part  1  (up  to  Week  24)  of  Study  CT-P10  3.2  in  RA  patients  and  PK  similarity 
demonstrated from Part 1 (up to Core Cycle 4 [12 weeks]) in Study CT-P10 3.3 in AFL patients.  
In Study CT-P10 3.2, all PK analyses were conducted using data from all patients who were administered 2,000 
mg  of  rituximab.  The  comparative  analysis  of  interest,  CT-P10  vs.  Mabthera,  showed  that,  for  all  but  one 
secondary  parameter,  all  PK  parameters  were  within  the  acceptance  limits.  The  only  parameter  that  had  a 
90%CI outside the limits (79.85 - 101.76) was AUCt-inf. – and for this single parameter also, Mabthera was not 
equivalent  to  Rituxan-  and  as  the  90%CI  included  100%  and  the  deviation  was  minor,  this  is  considered

acceptable.  However,  most  parameters  indicated  significantly  lower  exposure  with  CT-P10  compared  to 
Mabthera; compared to the results of the previous trial, the ratios were lower (close to 90%). Of note, exposure 
to rituximab tended to be higher with Mabthera compared to Rituxan. The lower exposure observed with the 
commercial product CT-P10 compared to MabThera in study CT-P10 3.2 and the higher protein content of the 
MabThera product compared to the CT-P10 product used in the PK trial is a plausible explanation for the slightly 
higher exposure to rituximab in the MabThera arm. A thorough investigation was performed in order to elucidate 
the  cause  for  the  cases  of  higher  than  expected  serum  concentrations  at  week  24  in  patients  including 
assay-related factors and subject related factors. It was postulated that it may be due to the inherent variability 
associated with systemic rituximab concentrations. Furthermore sensitivity analysis suggested no impact on the 
bioequivalence or efficacy responses. 
Additionally, other secondary PK parameters were also analysed in  Study CT-P10 3.2 and the  findings from 
these analyses are consistent between two RA studies and supports similarity between the two groups.  
Study CT-P10 3.3 compared the final product to be marketed with Rituxan in patients with advanced follicular 
lymphoma  (AFL)  in  both,  PK  population  and  ADA  negative  subset.  Similarity  of  these  products  was 
demonstrated  in  this  cancer  patient  population  since  the  90%  CIs  of  geometric  LS  means  ratio  (CT-P10  to 
Rituxan treatment group) for AUCtau and Cmax,ss were entirely contained in the equivalence range of 80% to 
125% regardless of including or excluding outliers, which indicates that rituximab exposures from CT-P10 are 
similar to those from Rituxan. Due to the limited number of patients with ADA positive results, PK similarity was 
evaluated only in the ADA negative subset and a trend of lower exposure in terms of AUCtau and Cmax,ss was 
detected in the ADA positive subset with similar extents between the CT-P10 and Rituxan groups. 
There were no clinical differences observed between CT-P10 and Mabthera in FF genotype patients versus VF 
plus VV genotype patients, although a trend to lower AUCs for VF plus VV groups compared to the FF groups was 
observed; even though results in these subgroups remain within the standard margin of 80-125%. 
The impact of immunogenicity on primary and secondary PK parameters, patients in PK population who did not 
show ADA was assessed separately. Furthermore, for the primary PK parameters, patients in PK population with 
positive ADA were assessed as a post-hoc base. Based on the data submitted for the primary PK parameters, 
similarity between CT-P10 and Mabthera was concluded for the PK (Antibody-negative subset), although in the 
PK (Antibody-positive subset), a difference is observed driven by fragmented power consequential to a small 
subset of antibody-positive patients across studies and high variability in individual PK and ADA titre values. 
Comprehensive analyses of the impact of ADA presence on PK and efficacy on assessing the extent of clinical 
relevance of such impact were carried out. These analyses were carried out not only in Study CT-P10 1.1 but 
also in the pivotal PK and therapeutic equivalence RA study, Study CT-P10 3.2. The analyses concluded that ADA 
presence resulted in reduced drug exposure but this impact was similar between CT-P10, Mabthera and Rituxan. 
In addition, this is a common observation and similarly with other approved biosimilar products, PK 
bioequivalence was not intended in the subgroup of antibody-positive patients (e.g., CT-P13, 
Remsima™/Inflectra™ in PK study in ankylosing spondylitis patients, where the 90% CIs of ratios of geometric 
means was outside of 80-125% for AUCt in PK (antibody-positive subset) population (Remsima™ EPAR). 
In conclusion, biosimilarity in terms of PK profiles for CT-P10 and Mabthera is demonstrated and supported by 
additional  PK  analyses  for  study  CT-P10  1.1,  PK  analyses  from  Study  CT-P10  3.2  which  compared  CT-P10, 
Mabthera and Rituxan and Study CT-P10 3.3 which compared CT-P10 and Rituxan.

B-cell depletion and recovery are considered clinically relevant markers of the therapeutic activity of rituximab. 
In accordance, B-cell counts have been selected as the key PD endpoint for the assessment of PD similarity 
between CT-P10 and Mabthera. 
Having said that, there is no strong correlation between the extent of B-cell reduction (at least when using a 
B-cell assay that is not sufficiently sensitive) and the extent of the clinical response in RA. For NHL, the 
correlation is even less clear, since circulating B-cells may not directly reflect tumour mass, and this response 
cannot be considered as an appropriate surrogate of the clinical response.   
In study CT-P10 1.1. mean B-cell levels BLOQ (20 cells/μl) were reached at the end of infusion in the CT-P10 
arm. All patients but one in the Mabthera arm  had reached levels below 20 cells/μl within 15 minutes after 
infusion end. In both study arms B-cell counts consistently remained below 20 cells/μl until week 16 for the 
majority of patients. 
B-cell recovery is likely to be the most sensitive PD endpoint available. Available data from Study CT-P10 1.1, 
i.e., the conjunction of earlier re-treatment (58% in the CT-P10 arm vs. 45% in the MabThera arm) and earlier 
B-cell recovery in the remaining patients of the CT-P10 arm, seemed highly suggestive of a relevant difference 
in the duration of action of the two products, which would not be favourable to CT-P10.  
In contrast to study CT-P10 1.1, study CT-P10 3.2 involved systematic retreatment at week 24, except for safety 
reasons (which occurred in 4 patients; 1%). Due to this design, little additional information is available to assess 
the duration of B-cell response.  
B-cell results of study 3.2, decreased to below the LLoQ (20 cells/μL) immediately after the 1st infusion for all 
patients , except 1 in CT-P10 group, and then remained below this level up to Week 24 in the majority of patients 
in all treatment groups. 
Nevertheless, the analysis of Part 1 showed a trend for earlier B-cell recovery with CT-P10 compared to 
MabThera and Rituxan. While the proportion of patients with B-cell recovery before week 48 was higher with 
Rituxan (31%) than CT-P10 (22%), it occurred in the majority of the cases at week 24 with Rituxan and at 
earlier time points with CT-P10. The proportion of patients with B-cell recovery was the lowest with MabThera 
(17%). When Parts 1 and 2 were combined, a slight difference between the two groups (CT-P10 and reference 
products) was apparent after the first treatment course. After the second treatment course, early B-cell 
recovery was infrequent regardless of the product.  
Additional PD and efficacy analyses for both RA trials, including a time to event Kaplan-Meier analysis with the 
event being first B-cell value above LLoQ or discontinuation for lack of efficacy, suggest a trend for earlier B-cell 
recovery in CT-P10 arms and thus shorter duration of action that could need more frequent administrations. 
Unfortunately, the design of the pivotal RA efficacy trial involving systematic re-treatment at Week 24 cannot 
address this question.  
In study C-P10 3. 3, in AFL population the extent of B-cell depletion appears similar between treatment arms, 
however updated data is still expected post-authorisation.  
In RA, the durability of the clinical response to rituximab is known to be variable and unpredictable in different 
patients. Systematic re-treatment after 6 months is not recommended in the EU SmPC of MabThera but rather 
based on return of disease activity in order to avoid overtreatment and decrease infection risks. 
The initial observation of Study 1.1 regarding the duration of activity of CT-P10 is likely a chance finding for the 
following reasons: 
•  Comparability of CT-P10 and MabThera has been demonstrated at the analytical and functional levels, 
with no differences suggesting different effects on B-cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 52/161 
  
  
 
• 
• 
The method used to count B-cells in blood samples lacked sensitivity (BLQ of 20 cells/µL). It is 
noteworthy that highly sensitive flow cytometry can currently detect levels as low as 0.1 cells/µL and 
may allow to correlate B-cell depletion with clinical response. 
The trial was small and only numerical trends were observed (no statistical evidence), especially since 
individual responses are known to be very variable. 
Therefore, biosimilarity of CT-P10 and MabThera from a PD perspective is considered demonstrated.  
Uncertainties regarding the earlier ADA formation with CT-P10 compared to Mabthera have been addressed with 
as Study  3.2  showed  opposite  trend  compared  to  those  of  Study  1.1.  Moreover,  the  immunogenicity  of  the 
commercial CT-P10 product, which appeared lower to that of MabThera in the pivotal study, could potentially be 
due to the lower proportion and size of higher molecular weight (HMW) species, which have been associated with 
increased immunogenicity in the literature. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK analyses from study CT-P10 1.1 demonstrate that the PK profiles are comparable. In addition, PK data in both 
RA and AFL patients support the extrapolation to all other indications covered by Mabthera. Differences in B-cell 
recovery were observed but did not translate into lower efficacy (See Clinical efficacy).

Treatments 
In the study CT-P10 1.1 patients were allowed to receive up to 2 courses of treatment. Each course consisted of 
2 infusions of study drug (1,000 mg CT-P10 or Mabthera by IV infusion) with a 2 week interval between the first 
and second infusions. During the Core Study Period, study drug infusions were to occur on Week 0 and Week 2. 
If residual disease activity remained or if disease activity returned within 48 weeks from the first dose date in the 
Core Study Period, patients could be retreated with the second course of study drug (2 infusions) during the 
Extension Study Period, initiated between 24 weeks and 48 weeks after the first infusion in the Core Study 
Period based on the response evaluation result from Week 16 to Week 40. 
CT-P10 and Mabthera were co-administered with MTX between 10 to 25 mg/week, orally or parenterally (dose 
and route had to be maintained from beginning to end of study) and folic acid ≥ 5 mg/week, oral dose. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study CT-P10 1.1 was to demonstrate similar PK in terms of area Under the serum 
Concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to the last measurable concentration after the 
second infusion (AUC0-last) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) after the second infusion between 
CT-P10 and Mabthera in patients with active RA concomitantly treated with MTX and folic acid up to Week 24 of 
the Core Study Period. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the additional PK variables of CT-P10 compared with Mabthera up to 
Week 24 of the Core Study Period and to evaluate the long-term efficacy, PD, overall safety and biomarkers of 
CT-P10 compared with Mabthera up to Week 72.

Sample size 
The study was powered to demonstrate PK equivalence of CT-P10 and MabThera in AUC0-last and Cmax. 
Equivalence was demonstrated if the 90% CI for the modeled ratio of CT-P10 to MabThera in AUC0-last and 
Cmax was within the bounds of 80% and 125%. Based on 90% power, a type I error of 0.1, an interpatient 
CV(%) in AUC0-last of 35%, and a true ratio of means of 1.0, 78 patients were needed in the CT-P10 treatment 
group and 39 patients were needed in the MabThera treatment group (117 patients in total). Allowing for a 
drop-out rate of 20%, 147 patients were to be randomly assigned into the study in a 2:1 allocation. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups on Day 0 (before administration of study drug) by using 
a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study. Patients were randomly assigned to 
a treatment group and assigned a kit schedule using an interactive web response system (IWRS) or interactive 
voice response system (IVRS). The randomization was stratified by region (European vs non-European) and 
prior anti-TNF-α blocker status (failure vs intolerant case). 
During randomization, some patients were misrandomized with regard to their prior anti-TNF-α blocker status. 
A variable was derived called prior anti-TNF-α blocker status (modified), which was the patient’s actual prior 
anti-TNF-α blocker status as recorded on the “Prior TNF Antagonist History” page of the eCRF. This variable was 
included in a sensitivity analysis of any model that used prior anti-TNF-α blocker status as a covariate. 
Blinding (masking) 
The unblinded randomization and materials kit schedules were developed by an independent team on a secure 
server and only distributed to named individuals (IVRS, packaging vendor, etc) as documented on a 
specification form signed by the sponsor. The study could be unblended only if specific emergency treatment 
were dictated by knowing the treatment status of the patient. 
Statistical methods 
The study was powered to demonstrate PK equivalence of CT-P10 and MabThera in AUC0-last and Cmax. 
Equivalence was demonstrated if the 90% CI for the modeled ratio of CT-P10 to MabThera in AUC0-last and 
Cmax was within the bounds of 80% and 125% 
Seven patient populations were defined: all-randomized, PK, PK (antibody-negative subset), PK 
(antibody-positive subset), PD, efficacy, and safety. Patients who had any major protocol deviations might have 
been excluded from the PK, PD and/or efficacy population 
The all-randomized population consisted of all patients enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a dose of 
either study drug (ie, allocated a randomization number as recorded on the “Randomization” eCRF), regardless 
of whether or not any study drug dosing was completed. Therefore, this population included all patients who 
were allocated a randomization number by IWRS/IVRS. Patients in the all-randomized population were analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. The all-randomized population was used as 
the denominator for percentages and data summaries were presented by randomized treatment. 
Analysis for the Core Study Period visits was based on all patients in the all-randomized population. The efficacy 
population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug (CT-P10 or MabThera) and 
provided at least 1 post-treatment efficacy result. Patients in the efficacy population were analyzed according to 
the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. This population was the primary analysis population for all

Results 
Participant flow 
Study CT-P10 1.1 
Recruitment 
A total of 55 CT-P10 1.1 study centers were initiated in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Of these study centers, 
40 screened patients and 38 randomly assigned patients to treatment. On 07 March 2012 the first patient 
randomly was assigned to treatment; the last patient last visit took place on 4 February 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
The major protocol deviations reported in Study CT-P10 1.1 were noncompliance with inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (2 [1.9%] patients and 3 [5.9%] patients in the CT-P10 and MabThera treatment groups, respectively). 
Patients with major protocol deviations of noncompliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria were excluded 
from the PK, PD, and efficacy populations.

The original protocol (version 1.0), dated 29 June 2011, was amended 12 times during the course of the study. 
Of them, only 3 were global amendments. The most relevant changes were the following (all in the global 
amendment 4):  the use of both prednisone and prednisolone was allowed; changed use of term “washout” to 
“discontinuation period” for consistency; clarified that the second course of therapy was to be decided upon a 
response evaluation result from Week 16 to Week 40;  Any response evaluation result obtained after Week 40 
(including an unscheduled visit) was not to be used to decide the second course of therapy.

etanercept in both the CT-P10 and MabThera treatment groups 
Overall, the duration of RA disease was similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean ± SD time since RA 
diagnosis was 11.15 ± 7.91 years in the CT-P10 group and 10.26 ± 9.10 years in the Mabthera group. All 
patients had morning stiffness, arthritis of 3 or more joint areas, arthritis of hand joints, and symmetric arthritis 
at the time of diagnosis

Ancillary analyses 
Historical Comparison between Study CT-P10 1.1 and MabThera studies 
The mean ± SD change from baseline of DAS28 (ESR) was -2.3 ± 1.4 in Mabthera group in the REFLEX study 
and -2.4 ± 1.6 in the DANCER study, respectively. The results from Study CT-P10 1.1 showed consistency with 
those reported from the rituximab trials with changes from baseline values of -2.1 ± 1.3 and -2.2 ± 1.5 in 
CT-P10 and Mabthera groups at Week 24. 
In CT-P10 Study 1.1, ACR20 at Week 24 were 65.9 % and 72.5 % in patients with ≥ 8 swollen joints (of 66 joints 
assessed) and ≥ 8 tender joints (of 68 joints assessed) in CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively, which are 
slightly higher than that of the reported trials as in 51.3 % in REFLEX and 51.9 % in DANCER trials

Maintenance Study CT-P10 1.3 
An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Maintenance Study to Demonstrate Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of CT-P10 in 
Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Were Treated with Rituximab (MabThera or CT-P10) in Study CT-P10 1.1 
Location 
The trial was conducted in 23 centres out of the 40 centres that participated in the Main Study and enrolled 87 
patients. 
Period 
First subject first visit:   
09-05-2013 
Last patient last visit:   
15-10-2014   
Methods 
This was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, efficacy and safety maintenance study of Study CT-P10 1.1. 
After the last visit of the Core Study Period (Week 48 of the Entire Study Period) or the last visit of the Extension 
Study Period (Week 24 of the Extension Study Period; up to Week 72 of the Entire Study Period) in Study CT-P10 
1.1, eligible patients had the opportunity to continue in Study CT-P10 1.3 for a maximum of 56 weeks. 
There were 3 periods in this study: 
•  Screening Period: Week –8 to Week 0 (Day –56 to Day –1) 
•  Monitoring Period: Every 8 weeks (±14 days) until the End-of-Study (EOS) Visit (after Week 96 and until 
Week 104 of the Entire Study Period) of the Maintenance Study Period (excluding the Treatment Period) 
•  Treatment Period: to be initiated between Week 48 and Week 80 of the Entire Study Period 
The study duration up to the end of the study including the Screening Period was up to 64 weeks. The total 
duration of the Entire Study (Main Study and Maintenance Study) was up to 104 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 66/161 
  
  
 
 
Patients were eligible for CT-P10 infusion in the Maintenance Study if all the following criteria were met: 
•  They were responders to the previous course of treatment. 
•  Their disease activity returned during the Monitoring Period compared with the best response obtained 
between Weeks 16 and 24 from when their last treatment was initiated. 
•  Their B-cell or IgM levels were equal to or higher than the LLN or at least 50 % of the Main Study Period 
baseline level (Week 0 [Day 0] in Study CT-P10 1.1) using the results from previous visits. 
Efficacy was evaluated using the same outcomes as in the Main Study. 
The Efficacy Population consisted of all patients receiving at least 1 full dose of CT-P10 in this study and 
providing at least 1 post-treatment efficacy result. The baseline value was derived from the baseline value in 
Study CT-P10 1.1. 
Patient disposition 
A total of 87 patients initiated the Maintenance Study: 58 patients and 29 patients in the maintenance and 
switch treatment arms, respectively. 
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm received a treatment course of CT-P10: 38 (65.5%) and 
20 (69.0%), respectively. A single patient (from the maintenance arm) received a second treatment course.

STUDY CT-P10 3.2  
This study is a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to compare the PK, efficacy 
and safety between CT-P10, Rituxan and Mabthera in Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The overall objective of this study was to demonstrate similar pharmacokinetics and efficacy of CT-P10 
compared to the reference products (Rituxan and Mabthera). With this purpose, this study was divided into 2 
parts.  
Part 1 was designed for demonstration of 3-way PK equivalence between CT-P10 and Mabthera, CT-P10 and 
Rituxan, Mabthera and Rituxan in terms of AUC0-last, AUC0-∞, and Cmax (after the second infusion) of CT-P10 to 
Rituxan, CT-P10 to Mabthera, and Rituxan to Mabthera during the first treatment course (over the first 24 
weeks). 
Part 2 was intended to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between CT-P10 and the combined reference 
products, Mabthera and Rituxan in terms of efficacy as determined by clinical response according to change from 
baseline in disease activity measured by DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24. 
The Extension Study Period, which was designed to evaluate additional safety and immunogenicity, was initiated 
between Week 48 and Week 52 of the entire study period. The study duration was therefore up to 76 weeks after 
the Week 0 infusion.

EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 70/161 
  
  
 
 
 
 
A dose of 1,000 mg of CT-P10, Mabthera or Rituxan (IV) were co-administered with methotrexate (MTX) given 
at a dose between 7.5 to 25 mg orally or parenterally every week (dose and route had to be maintained from the 
beginning to the end of the study) and folic acid at a dose of ≥ 5 mg/week. Each course consists of 2 infusions 
separated by a 2-week interval. In the third treatment course (1 additional course in the Extension Study 
Period), patients who received Rituxan in the Main Study Period will be re-randomised to either the Rituxan or 
CT-P10 treatment groups and patients who received Mabthera in the Main Study Period will be switched to 
CT-P10 while patients who received CT-P10 will remain in CT-P10 group. 
The main criteria for inclusion was male or female patients between 18 and 75 years old, inclusive, who had 
been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis according to the revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) classification criteria for at least 6 months prior to randomization. Active disease was defined by the 
presence of 6 or more swollen joints and 6 or more tender joints, and serum CRP ≥1.5 mg/dL (≥15 mg/L) or an 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥28 mm/hour. Patients were to have received methotrexate treatment 
(7.5 to 25 mg/week orally or parenterally) for at least the past 12 weeks, with the last 4 weeks at a stable dose 
before screening. Patients were to have experienced an inadequate response to previous treatment with the 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents or were intolerant to these agents. 
Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the 95% CI for the treatment difference in the change from baseline 
of DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24 by the ANCOVA analysis was entirely within the equivalence margin of ±0.60. The 
least square means and associated 95% CI were reported by back transforming the least square means 
difference and 95% CI produced by these models. 
A total of 372 male and female patients with RA were enrolled; 189 patients were included in Part 1 and 1:1:1 
randomised into the CT-P10, Mabthera and the Rituxan group.  
The analysis population used in this study is summarised in the following Table.

All patients received MTX and folic acid during the study, as per the study design and requirements. The mean 
± SD dose of MTX taken at the 1st infusion in Part 1 was similar among the 4 treatment groups (15.23 ± 4.93 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 74/161 
  
  
 
 
 
in CT-P10 group, 15.63 ± 5.01 in Mabthera group. 15.46 ± 5.21 in Rituxan group and 15.54 ± 5.10 in reference 
products group, respectively). In Part 2, the mean ± SD dose of MTX taken at the 1st infusion was similar to Part 
1 and was similar among the 4 treatment groups (14.61 ± 4.34 in CT-P10 group, 15.63 ± 5.01 in Mabthera 
group. 14.77 ± 4.51 in Rituxan group and 15.01 ± 4.66 in reference products group, respectively). 
Overall, the duration of RA disease was similar among the treatment groups in Part 1 and Part 2. The mean ± SD 
time since RA diagnosis was 9.4 ± 6.8 years in the CT-P10 group, 9.9 ± 7.4 years in the Mabthera group, 8.2 ± 
5.3 years in the Rituxan group and 9.0 ± 6.43 in reference products group in Part 1, respectively. The mean ± 
SD time since RA diagnosis in Part 2 was 10.7 ± 8.0 years in the CT-P10 group, 9.9 ± 7.4 years in the Mabthera 
group, 8.8 ± 7.4 years in the Rituxan group and 9.1 ± 7.4 in reference products group, respectively. 
In the efficacy population, the change from baseline in disease activity measured by DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24 
was compared using ANCOVA. In the efficacy population, the 95% CIs for the estimate of treatment difference 
was  well  within  the  pre-defined  equivalence  margin  of  0.6  and  hence,  the  therapeutic  equivalence  between 
CT-P10 and reference products group in terms of change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24 has been 
established at the 5% level of significance. A similar result was found in change from baseline of DAS28 (ESR), 
showing no significant difference between CT-P10 and reference products groups. The same analysis has been 
carried out in the all-randomised population as a sensitivity analysis.

In  addition,  the  Applicant  has  performed  an  additional  analysis  for  proportion  of  patients  achieving  clinical 
response  according  to  ACR20/50/70  at  4-weeks  interval  as  a  post-hoc  manner.  The  number  of  patients 
achieving ACR20/50/70 was similar between CT-P10 and reference products groups at earlier time points as 
well.

The sensitivity analysis for the proportions of patients achieving clinical responses according to ACR20, ACR50 
and ACR70 criteria in Study CT-P10 3.2 were conducted with treating missing data as a non-responder. These 
analyses aligned with the initial results which were performed without missing data imputation 
In the efficacy population, the mean decreases from baseline were similar among CT-P10, Mabthera, Rituxan 
and the reference products groups throughout the study for the following ACR components: mean number of 
tender joints, mean number of swollen joints, mean VAS scores for the patient assessment of pain, mean VAS 
scores for the patient and physician global assessment of disease activity, mean score for the HAQ estimate of 
physical ability, CRP and ESR.

The  median  (25th  percentile,  75th  percentile)  time  to  onset  of  ACR20  response  was  shorter  for  patients  in 
CT-P10 group than patients in Mabthera and Rituxan groups (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile] was 30.0 
[29.0, 60.0] days in CT-P10 group, 57.0 [29.0, 85.0] days in Mabthera group and 56.0 [29.0, 85.0] days in 
Rituxan  group,  respectively),  but  this  finding  should  be  treated  with  caution  due  to  limited  evaluation  time 
points. In addition, there  was  no statistically meaningful difference between CT-P10 and reference products 
groups when analysed using Log-rank test (p=0.4317). 
The mean hybrid ACR scores at Week 24 were similar among CT-P10, Mabthera, Rituxan and the reference 
products  groups  (mean  [SD]  score  were  51.68  [25.38]  in  CT-P10  group,  50.54  [27.34]  in  Mabthera  group, 
52.39 [24.56] in Rituxan group and 51.84 [25.35] in reference products group, respectively) in the efficacy 
population. 
The mean decreases from baseline in SDAI and CDAI at each time point were similar between 
theCT-P10, Mabthera, Rituxan and reference products groups. 
Long term data 
Long-term efficacy data up to Week 48 in Study CT-P10 3.2 were also analysed. 
The  efficacy  population  was  used  as  the  main  analysis  set  for  efficacy.  As  a  matter  of  sensitivity  analyses, 
efficacy was analysed in ITT population. 
For DAS28 analysis, the change from baseline in disease activity measured by DAS28 was analysed using an 
ANCOVA method which is as specified in the SAP. In the efficacy population, the 95% CIs for the estimate of

treatment difference for both DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) were well within ± 0.60 up to Week 48; ± 0.60 was 
the pre-specified therapeutic margin of Study CT-P10 3.2 for the primary endpoint at 24 weeks. 
For DAS28 (CRP), the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and reference product groups during the 
1st treatment course were (-0.32, 0.07), (-0.33, 0.09), (-0.39, 0.03), (-0.36, 0.08), (-0.36, 0.13) and (-0.29, 
0.20) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, respectively. For the 2nd treatment course over the longer term period, 
the 95% CIs of the differences were (-0.34, 0.16), (-0.35, 0.19) and (-0.35, 0.21) at Weeks 32, 40 and 48, 
respectively. 
For DAS28 (ESR), the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and reference product groups during the 
1st treatment course were (-0.32, 0.08), (-0.29, 0.13), (-0.39, 0.04), (-0.30, 0.16), (-0.45, 0.05) and (-0.31, 
0.19) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, separately. For the 2nd treatment course over the longer term period, 
the 95% CIs of the differences were (-0.41, 0.11), (-0.44, 0.13) and (-0.41, 0.20) at Weeks 32, 40 and 48, 
respectively. 
Overall, the efficacy between the 2 treatment groups was maintained to a similar degree over the long-term 
period up to Week 48. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 82/161 
  
  
 
 
Long-term efficacy was also evaluated using ACR analyses. 
In the efficacy population, the proportions of patients achieving clinical response according to the ACR20/50/70 
were similar between the CT-P10 and the reference products groups up to Week 48. The proportions increased 
until Week 20 and were maintained in the long-term period over 48 week in the 2 treatment groups.  
For ACR20, the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and reference products groups during the 1st 
treatment course were (-0.04, 0.18), (-0.08, 0.12), (-0.02, 0.16), (-0.11, 0.06), (- 0.02, 0.15) and (-0.11, 
0.07) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, respectively. For the 2nd treatment course over the longer term period, 
the  95%  CIs  of  the  differences  were  (-0.07,  0.07)  (-0.06,  0.09)  (-0.07,  0.10)  at  Weeks  32,  40  and  48, 
Assessment report

respectively.  The  95%  CI  of  the  differences  according  to  the  ACR50  and  ACR70  criteria  were  also  similar 
between the CT-P10 and reference products groups. 
Overall, the efficacy between CT-P10 and reference products groups remained similar over the long-term period 
up to Week 48, which provides reassurance on the therapeutic equivalence derived from change from baseline 
in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24.

• 
Long-term Efficacy Data in Part 1 
Same efficacy analyses as conducted on the Part 2 patients were also executed for the Part 1 patients of Study 
CT-P10 3.2, where the patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 to receive CT-P10: Mabthera: Rituxan. This allows 
respective comparison of CT-P10 versus Mabthera and CT-P10 versus Rituxan to support in-depth comparison 
among 3 treatment groups. 
For the all Part 1 analyses, the analyses method and ITT/Efficacy population and their subsets were applied in 
the same manner as Part 2; 64 (100%), 60 (100%), 65 (100%) patients for ITT population and 58 (90.6%), 58 
(96.7%), 59 (90.8%) patients for ITT for the 2nd treatment course in Main Study Period Subset, 61 (95.3%), 59 
(98.3%), 61 (93.8%) patients for efficacy population and 57 (89.1%), 58 (96.7%), 57 (87.7%) patients for 
efficacy  for  the  2nd  treatment  course  in  Main  Study  Period  Subset  in  the  CT-P10,  Mabthera  and  Rituxan, 
respectively.  
In the efficacy population, for DAS28 (CRP), the 95% CIs of the differences between the CTP10 and Mabthera 
groups during the 1st treatment course were (-0.15, 0.46), (-0.18, 0.55), (- 0.06, 0.62), (-0.12, 0.57), (-0.46, 
0.36) and (-0.56, 0.26) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, respectively. For the 2nd treatment course over the 
long-term period up to 48 weeks, the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups were 
(-0.43, 0.41), (-0.63, 0.29), (-0.51, 0.41) at Weeks 32, 40 and 48, respectively.  
For DAS28 (ESR), the 95% CIs of the differences  between the CT-P10 and  Mabthera groups during the 1st 
treatment course were (-0.11, 0.53), (-0.18, 0.54), (-0.01, 0.70), (-0.17, 0.56), (- 0.31, 0.51) and (-0.44, 
0.40) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, respectively. For the 2nd treatment course over the long-term period up 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 85/161 
  
  
 
 
to 48 weeks, the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and  Mabthera groups were (-0.29, 0.55), 
(-0.47, 0.48), (-0.36, 0.61) at Weeks 32, 40 and 48, respectively. 
The 95% CIs for the estimate of treatment differences of CT-P10 and MabThera were well within the range ± 
0.60 for most of the time points, which is the pre-specified therapeutic margin applied to the primary endpoint 
of Study CT-P10 3.2 for Week 24 time-point, except points including Week 12 for DAS28 (CRP, ESR), Week 40 
for DAS 28 (CRP) and Week 48 for DAS28 (ESR). However it should be noted that Part 1 was not powered or 
intended  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  given  its  smaller  data  set.  The  sample  size  of  Part  1  was 
almost twice smaller than that of Part 2 and therefore no conclusions can be drawn in respect to some of the 
DAS28 response variability in this fragmented subset. Importantly, the DAS28 response variability did not follow 
any specific pattern and was not replicated in appropriately powered Part 2 demonstrating consistent and similar 
therapeutic responses through an entire 48 week treatment perio. Considering the above, it is concluded that 
there were no statistically significant differences at the 5% significance level since the 95% CIs included 0 in all 
cases. 
Also, the same analysis has been carried out in the ITT population as a sensitivity analysis and the results were 
in line with that on the efficacy population 
Assessment report

The long-term efficacy using ACR analyses were evaluated in Part 1 in the same manner as was performed for 
Part 2. 
In the efficacy population, the proportions of patients achieving clinical responses according to the ACR20/50/70 
criteria  were  similar  between  the  CT-P10,  Mabthera  and  Rituxan  groups  up  to  Week  48.  The  proportions 
increased until Week 20 and were maintained long-term up to Week 48 in the 3 treatment groups. 
For ACR20, the 95% CIs of the differences between the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups during the 1st treatment 
course were (-0.25, 0.12) (-0.21, 0.15) (-0.28, 0.05) (-0.15, 0.16) (-0.20, 0.09) and (-0.17, 0.15) at Weeks 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, respectively. For the 2nd treatment course over the longer term period, up to 48 weeks, 
the 95% CIs of the differences were (-0.17, 0.10), (-0.10, 0.13) and (-0.19, 0.09) at Weeks 32, 40 and 48, 
respectively. The 95% CIs of these differences according to the ACR50 and ACR70 criteria were also similar 
between the CT-P10 and MabThera groups

STUDY CT-P10 3.3  
A Phase 1/3, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Active-Controlled, Double-Blind Study to Demonstrate Equivalence of 
Pharmacokinetics and Noninferiority of Efficacy for CT-P10 in Comparison With Rituxan, Each Administered in 
Combination With Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and Prednisone (CVP) in Patients With Advanced Follicular 
Lymphoma (see section on Pharmacokinetics.) 
•  Objectives 
The overall objective of this study was to demonstrate similar pharmacokinetics and non-inferior efficacy of 
CT-P10  compared  to  Rituxan.  The  study  was  divided  into  2  parts,  each  of  which  assessed  1  of  2  primary 
endpoints, as follows: 
Part 1: The primary objective of Part 1 of the study was to demonstrate that CT-P10 is similar to Rituxan in terms 
of pharmacokinetics as determined by area under the serum concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCtau) 
and maximum serum concentration at steady state (CmaxSS) at Core Cycle 4. 
Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 of the study will be to demonstrate that CT-P10 is noninferior to Rituxan 
in  terms  of  efficacy  as  determined  by  overall  response  rate  (ORR)  (complete  response  [CR]  +  unconfirmed 
complete  response  [CRu]  +  partial  response  [PR])  over  Cycle  8  (Core  Study  Period)  according  to  the  1999

International Working Group (IWG) criteria in previously untreated patients with advanced (stage III-IV) CD20+ 
follicular lymphoma (FL). 
The  response  evaluation  listing  includes  information  about  date  of  evaluation,  evaluation  of  target  lesion, 
evaluation of nontarget lesion, evaluation of new lesion, bone marrow involvement, organ enlargement, LDH 
level, B-symptom, overall response evaluated, PD date, best overall response (BOR), and BOR date based on 
local review using 1999 IWG and 2007 IWG criteria by treatment group for the ITT population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part 2 will be the ORR (CR + CRu +PR) during the Core Study Period as per the 
1999 IWG criteria. It should be noted that the non-inferiority margin was based on absolute point estimate 
difference and not using 95% CI approach.

•  Outcomes 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In  the  PP  population,  based  on  central  review,  the  proportions  of  patients  achieving  overall  response 
(CR+CRu+PR) according to 1999 IWG criteria were 97.0% (64/66 patients) and 92.6% (63/68 patients) in the 
CT-P10 and Rituxan groups, respectively (Table 22). The difference between the groups of the ORR according to 
the 1999 IWG criteria was 4.3% and lies on the positive side of the pre-defined non-inferiority margin using a 
point estimate difference of -7% based on reference product variability which was defined in the protocol.

Additional Efficacy Parameters 
Bone marrow assessments and B-symptoms assessments were performed and the results were similar between 
the 2 treatment groups. In the bone marrow assessments, bone marrow involvement at screening was reported 
for  78  (55.7%)  patients  (45  [64.3%]  patients  and  33  [47.1%]  patients  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan  groups, 
respectively).  Slight  chance  driven  baseline  difference  in  bone  marrow  difference,  nevertheless,  had  not 
influenced  similarity  in  overall  response.  Among  these  78  patients  who  reported  positive  at  screening,  39 
patients returned to negative at post-treatment visits (22 patients in the CT-P10 group and 17 patients in the 
Rituxan group, respectively). There were no differences found between the 2 treatment groups and there were 
no  patients  who  newly  reported  positive  for  bone  marrow  test  at  post-treatment  visits.  In  the  B-symptoms 
results, the number of patients with at least 1 B-symptom at screening was 37 (26.4%) patients (17 [24.3%] 
patients and 20 [28.6%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan groups, respectively). At EOT1, B-symptoms were 
present in only 1 (1.4%) patient in the CTP10 group, and the patient was evaluated as partial response (PR) at 
EOT1. There were no notable differences between the 2 treatment groups. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development encompasses a Phase 1 PK equivalence study between CT-P10 and the EU reference 
product (MabThera) in patients with RA (Study CT-P10 1.1), followed by a therapeutic equivalence Phase 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 96/161 
  
  
 
 
 
 
study in RA patients (Study CT-P10 3.2). The Phase 3 study consists of 2 parts, i.e., part 1 is designed to 
evaluate 3-way PK equivalence of CT-P10 against reference products, Mabthera and Rituxan, whereas part 2 is 
aimed at establishing therapeutic equivalence between CT-P10 and reference rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) 
(Study CT-P10 3.2). The Phase 1 PK equivalence Study CT-P10 1.1 in RA patients has an extension to assess 
long-term safety and efficacy up to Week 104 (Study CT-P10 1.3). This clinical data package is further supported 
by preliminary data from 1 study in an oncology indication, i.e., a Phase 1/3 PK equivalence study between 
CT-P10 and Rituxan in patients with AFL (Study CT-P10 3.3).  
Study CT-P10 1.1 is a phase 1, randomised, controlled, multicentre, 2-Arm, parallel-group, double-blind study 
to demonstrate the equivalence of CT-P10 to Mabthera with respect to the PK profile in patients with RA. This 
setting is considered a sensitive clinical model to detect potential efficacy differences between CT-P10 and 
MabThera. The study population consisted of male and female patients with active RA who experienced an 
inadequate response to previous or current treatment with the TNF inhibitors infliximab, golimumab, 
adalimumab or etanercept, or was intolerant to at least 1 administration of these agents. However, MabThera is 
authorised in patients with severe, active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other 
DMARD including 1 or more TNF inhibitor therapies, whereas the inclusion criteria for the CT-P10 1.1 study allow 
the recruitment of patients with moderate to severe RA. In this perspective, the efficacy data from the subset of 
patients with ≥ 8 swollen joints (of 66 joints assessed) and ≥ 8 tender joints (of 68 joints assessed) matching 
the inclusion criterion of the REFLEX and DANCER studies, have been evaluated in the post-hoc analysis. 
Efficacy was assessed by the evaluation of the ACR criteria (individual components, ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, 
time to onset of ACR20, and hybrid ACR response), mean decrease in DAS28, EULAR response criteria, CDAI, 
SDAI, joint damage progression (radiographic evaluations, Sharp/van der Heijde modified score), general 
health status (Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]), and functional disability (HAQ). 
From a clinical view these are standard endpoints, mainly based on ACR criteria and DAS28, which is agreed. 
The joint damage and EULAR response status are of value. The ACR20, 50, 70 and DAS28 parameters are 
assessed at 8-week intervals up to Week 24. This was agreed with the SAWP so as to be able to detect 
differences between the treatments. Nevertheless, all the efficacy endpoints are secondary variables in this 
study.  
The study CT-P10 1.1 was powered to demonstrate PK equivalence of CT-P10 and MabThera in AUC0-last and 
Cmax. No sample size calculations based on efficacy were carried out. However, the statistical comparison of 
both products has been carried out in a post-hoc way. The primary objective of the post-hoc-analyses was to 
investigate the therapeutic equivalence for DAS28 between CT-P10 and Mabthera at Week 24 in the study 
CT-P10 1.1. According to the company, in order to determine an appropriate equivalence margin for DAS28, a 
literature search of DAS28 responses with rituximab in RA patients who had inadequate response to one or more 
TNF antagonist therapies was carried out. In the DANCER study (Emery et al., 2006), analysis of variance 
showed the adjusted mean change in DAS28 from baseline to be significantly greater in patients treated with 
rituximab (2 x 500 mg, 2 x 1000 mg) than in patients treated with placebo (- 1.79 and -2.05 vs. -0.67). In the 
pivotal REFLEX study (Cohen et al., 2006) the mean change from baseline in the DAS28 score was -1.9 in the 
rituximab arm vs. -0.4 in the placebo arm, corresponding to a treatment difference of 1.5. As advised by the 
CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/78796/2014), a properly chosen equivalence margin should exclude clinically relevant 
effects. The EULAR response criteria define a change in DAS28 of up to 0.6 points within an individual as 'no 
improvement' (Fransen et al., 2005). In line with SAWP/CHMP recommendations, margin of ± 0.6 for the 
post-hoc analysis of therapeutic equivalence in CT-P10 1.1 study and pre-defined equivalence in CT-P10 3.2 
study has been employed. From a clinical perspective the use of DAS28 as main variable when it comes to 
assessing the similarity is endorsed and moreover if in addition to the analysis based on DAS28, the individual 
components of ACR criteria are also compared between treatments.

Study 3.2 is a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to compare the PK, efficacy 
and safety between CT-P10, Rituxan and Mabthera in Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Part 1 was 
designed for demonstration of 3-way PK equivalence between CT-P10 and Mabthera, CT-P10 and Rituxan, 
Mabthera and Rituxan. Part 2 was intended to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between CT-P10 and the 
combined reference products, Mabthera and Rituxan in terms of efficacy as determined by clinical response 
according to change from baseline in disease activity measured by DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24. The Extension 
Study Period, which was designed to evaluate additional safety and immunogenicity, was initiated between 
Week 48 and Week 52 of the entire study period and was up to 76 weeks after the Week 0 infusion. 
Study 3.3 is a Phase 1/3, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind study to demonstrate 
equivalence of pharmacokinetics and non-inferiority of efficacy for CT-P10 in comparison with Rituxan, each 
administered in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CVP) in patients with 
Advanced Follicular Lymphoma (AFL). The primary efficacy endpoint for Study CT-P10 3.3 assessed in Part 2 of 
the study is the ORR (CR + CRu + PR) according to 1999 IWG criteria over Cycle 8 in Part 2 which is an accepted 
endpoint in this setting. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, demographic characteristics in the study CT-P10 1.1 were well balanced between the 2 treatment 
groups. The mean ± SD age of patients was 49.8 ± 12.54 years in the CT-P10 group and 51.3 ± 10.86 years in 
the Mabthera group. In total, there were fewer male patients than female patients (19 [12.3 %] male patients 
compared with 135 [87.7 %] female patients). The majority of patients were white (105 [68.2 %] patients). The 
mean ± SD body mass index of patients was 27.11 ± 6.04 kg/m2 in the CT-P10 group and 27.53 ± 5.46 kg/m2 
in the Mabthera group. Generally speaking, both groups are evenly balanced and the slight differences should 
not be critical in terms of efficacy. 
Regarding efficacy results, overall, both treatments are similar in terms of ACR. The proportion of subject who 
achieved ACR 20 in CT-P 10 and MabThera respectively was 57.0% and 54.2 %, at Week 8; 70.0% and 68.8% 
patients at Week 16 and 63.0% and 66.7 % at Week 24. Results are pretty similar if ACR 50 and 70 are looked. 
Regarding the individual components of the ACR criteria, all the items analysed show a comparable result (mean 
number of tender joints, mean number of swollen joints, mean VAS scores for the patient assessment of pain, 
mean VAS scores for the patient and physician global assessment of disease activity, mean score for the HAQ 
estimate of physical ability, CRP and ESR). 
The time of onset of ACR20 response is also similar between CT-P10 and MabThera with medians of 58.0 and 
60.0 days, respectively. Regarding the change from baseline in the disease activity measured by DAS28 in Study 
CT-P10 1.1, the post-hoc analysis carried out by the applicant meets the equivalence therapeutic according to 
the equivalence margin of 0.60. 
More patients were re-treated after Week 24 and before Week 48 of the Main Study in the CT-P10 arm (58%) 
than in the MabThera arm (45%). It is agreed that the decision for re-treatment is multifactorial but, as the 
study was blinded, there should not be any significant bias to explain this observation; moreover eligibility 
criteria for re-treatment were met in the same proportion of patients and furthermore, the proportion of patients 
that were re-treated despite being ineligible was also higher in the CT-P10 arm than in the MabThera arm. 
Finally, the time to re-treatment estimated throughout the whole trial was shorter in the CT-P10 arm than in the 
MabThera arm; this difference is not statistically significant. 
The Applicant conducted ANCOVA analyses of DAS28 in the all-randomised/treated population (ITT analysis) 
and efficacy population (PP analysis) of Study CT-P10 1.1 using baseline value as a covariate. Missing data and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 98/161 
  
  
 
data for visits after retreatments were imputed using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) for 
all-randomised/treated population. These analyses showed, in both ITT and PP populations, equivalent efficacy 
up to week 32 but indicated slightly lower efficacy at the last time points. However, it is accepted that there is 
no statistically significant difference between the two products. 
In order to support the equivalence of the two products, comparative ITT and PP (efficacy population) analyses 
were performed with estimates calculated for the differences in ACR rates between treatments and their 95% 
confidence intervals at Core Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48. For the ITT analysis weeks with missing data or 
after re-treatment were treated as non-response. Results from these analyses show that the ACR20 rates were 
broadly comparable between the two treatment arms except at week 48 (lower for CT-P10, with 95%CI of the 
difference being [-23%; +5%]). The study was not powered to show equivalence and no equivalence margins 
were predefined. Even at week 24, the 95%CI of the difference would seem rather wider [-17%; +16%] than 
clinically acceptable. Nevertheless, all 95%CI included 100%. In the PP analysis, the ACR20 rates were broadly 
comparable between the two treatment arms except at weeks 24 and 48 (lower for CT-P10, with 95%CI of the 
difference being [-22%; +11%] and [-33%; +23%]). The ACR50 rates were broadly comparable between the 
two treatment arms. 
In addition, efficacy data from Study CT-P10 1.1 were compared to historical data from the pivotal Phase 3 
registration study REFLEX for MabThera and the supportive Phase 2b registration study DANCER. Overall, the 
comparison among the different studies and subgroups showed an apparent similarity between CT-P 10 and 
MabThera.  
In the study CT-P10 1.3, similar conclusions could be achieved regarding the equivalence of CT-P10 and 
MabThera. The clinical response in terms of ACR and DAS28 seems similar between groups. However this is a 
descriptive analysis and due to the sample size no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Regarding the study 3.2, in the efficacy population, the 95% CIs for the estimate of treatment difference was 
within the equivalence margin of 0.6 (in terms of change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24). A similar 
result was found in change from baseline of DAS28 (ESR), showing no significant difference between CT-P10 and 
reference products groups. Also, the same analysis has been carried out in the all-randomised population as a 
sensitivity analysis and the results were in line with that of efficacy population. In contrast to study CT-P10 1.1, 
study CT-P10 3.2 involved systematic retreatment at week 24, except for safety reasons (which occurred in 4 
patients; 1%). The proportion of patients that completed two treatment courses was roughly comparable across 
treatment arms: 87% (CT-P10), 89% (Rituxan); 93% (MabThera). The main reason for discontinuation, 
especially for CT-P10, was withdrawal of consent. 
Focusing on the results from the study 3.2, as the number of excluded patients was small, analyses in the 
efficacy and ITT populations provide very similar results. In Part 1 and 2 combined, DAS28 differences (without 
imputation) appeared marginally in favour of CT-P10 during the 24 weeks following the second treatment course 
and in line with the results after the first treatment course. Their 95% confidence intervals lied within the 
pre-defined limits of ± 0.6. 
Likewise, the ACR responses (missing data imputed as failures) were very similar for CT-P10 and the reference 
products during the 24 weeks following the second treatment course with all 95% confidence intervals within ± 
0.15. 
The results of the patients randomised to the three treatment arms in Part 1 showed a favourable trend for 
CT-P10 compared to both reference products during the first weeks after the first treatment course, which 
tapered by weeks 20-24; after the second treatment course, the results of CT-P10 and MabThera were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 99/161 
  
  
 
comparable, and slightly better than those of Rituxan. The ACR responses were very similar between the three 
treatment arms with no consistent trend. 
Study CT-P10 3.3 is a supportive study to confirm biosimilarity in oncology and subsequently the extrapolation 
of the indications of rituximab in oncology. Baseline characteristics do not reveal important differences between 
groups. The population analysed in part 2 (efficacy) is evenly balanced between groups. A total of 184 patients 
were screened for enrollment in Part 2. One hundred forty patients were randomly assigned to study drug and 
initiated the Core study treatment (70 patients in each treatment group). 62 subjects completed the core study 
(part 2). The reasons for discontinuation from the core period are overall balanced between CT-P10 and Rituxan 
arms, with 8 patients in each group. Major protocol deviations and other categories used for exclusion from ITT 
population do not seem to have an impact on the results (in total, 6 patients (4 [5.7%] patients in the CT-P10 
treatment group and 2 [2.9%] patients in the Rituxan treatment group) were excluded from the PP population 
for the primary efficacy endpoint). 
Demographic characteristics seem to be evenly balanced (age: 57 vs 58.5; ECOG 0-1: 98.6% vs 98.5). The 
mean (SD) disease duration of lymphoma was 3.43 (7.283) months in the CT-P10 treatment group and 2.35 
(2.907) months in the Rituxan treatment group. Follicular lymphoma CD20+ was confirmed in all patients in 
both groups. The most commonly reported FL grade at the time of screening was FL grade 2 (36 [51.4%] 
patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 34 [48.6%] patients in the Rituxan treatment group). Nevertheless, 
there are some imbalances in Ann Arbor Stage. At the time of screening, patients in Ann Arbor Stage III were 
30% vs 51.4% and Ann Arbor Stage III 70% vs 48.6% CT-P10 vs Rituxan respectively. Regarding FLIPI score, 
there are slight differences between groups, overall with a greater percentage of patients in FLIPI scores 3-4 in 
Rituxan than in CT-P10 (60% vs 47.2% respectively). This difference seem to be driven by the nodal 
involvement, with 65.7% and 84.3% of patients with a number of nodal sites >4 (CT-P10 vs Rituxan 
respectively) and not seem to play a critical role in the conclusion. 
Focusing on the efficacy results of the part 2, only ORR according to 1999 IWG criteria has been submitted. ORR 
as per the 2007 IWG criteria, time-to-event parameters including PFS, TTP, TTF, response duration, DFS and 
OS, and follow-up duration will be included in the final report of the study.  
ORR is an acceptable endpoint for this application of biosimilarity in follicular lymphoma indication. The company 
has established an equivalence margin of 7%, even though and according to the company the non-inferiority 
margin was based on absolute point estimate difference and not using 95% CI approach. The 7% is apparently 
based on an expected ORR of 81% (Marcus et al. 2005). In this study MabThera showed 81% CR + CRu + PR 
(n=162) compared with CVP alone, which showed a 57% response rate (n=159). In another study an ORR of 
88% was reported in patients in the R-CVP treatment arm (Federico et al 2013). Considering this 7% difference 
in the ORR compared to the previous historical data used (Marcus et al 2005), a 7% non-inferiority margin has 
been selected to assess efficacy (in the CT-P10 3.3 study, an ORR of 81% has been selected as the point 
estimate for the sample size calculation). These calculations are in accordance the EMA Guidance Choice of 
Non-inferiority Margin and acceptable from a clinical perspective. On analysing the ORR (central review) both in 
PP and ITT population, the difference lies within 7% (4.3% and 5.7% PP and ITT respectively). ORR appears 
slightly superior to CT-P10 (97% vs 92.6% and 95.7% vs 90.0% CT-P10 vs Rituxan PP and ITT respectively). 
The pattern of the responses points out towards more CR and similar PR, but the number of unconfirmed CR 
could change these values. The lower bound for 95%CI both in PP and ITT would lie within 7% (ORR difference: 
PP population 4.3% [95%CI -4.14; 13.33] ITT population 5.7% [95%CI -3.4; 15.4]). However as 7% is 
considered a very conservative margin, seeing as outlined above the half of the differences between the R-CVP 
and CVP in ORR (Marcus et al 2005) would be 12%; and considering the sample size of study CT-P10 3.3, it is 
plausible that with a bigger sample size, the CI had been narrower.  
Assessment report

Analyses carried out according to ADA status reveal similar outcomes to the main ones. No data on ORR as per 
the 2007 IWG criteria, time-to-event parameters including PFS, TTP, TTF, response duration, DFS and OS have 
been submitted. PFS and OS analyses will be submitted in the final CSR (see RMP) and as yearly updates as 
patients who experienced CR, CRu, or PR after Cycle 8 of the Core Study Period will enter in the Maintenance 
Study Period with rituximab only. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Biosimilarity of CT-P10 and MabThera is considered demonstrated based on the efficacy data. In the pivotal RA 
trial, efficacy results in terms of DAS28 and ACR were shown to be comparable between CT-P10 and MabThera. 
In addition, PK data discussed support the extrapolation to the autoimmune indications MPA/GPA. 
The objectives of study CT-P10 3.3 were to demonstrate similarity in pharmacokinetics and non-inferiority in 
efficacy of CT-P10 to Rituxan as primary endpoints when coadministered with CVP in patients with advanced FL; 
these objectives have been met and furthermore, extrapolation in the context of NHL and CLL indications is 
acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development programme comprises for CT-P10 six studies, including maintenance studies. As of this 
date, two clinical studies have been completed, one has been terminated, two are ongoing, and one is planned. 
The completed studies comprise a  randomised,  controlled  comparison  of  the pharmacokinetics,  efficacy  and 
safety of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with up to two courses of CT-P10 or MabThera (Study CT-P10 
1.1), and an open-label maintenance study in which eligible subjects from Study CT-P10 1.1 were treated with 
CT-P10 for a total cumulative observation interval in both studies for each subject of up to 104 weeks (Study 
CT-P10 1.3).  
A pilot Phase 1, open-label and single-arm study, CT-P10 1.2, in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse 
large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  was  initiated  but  prematurely  terminated  due  to  recruitment  issues  after  1 
patient had been enrolled. In addition, 3 Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing, which are Study CT-P10 3.2 in 
RA patients, Study CT-P10 3.3 in advanced follicular lymphoma (AFL) patients and Study CT-P10 3.4 in low 
tumour burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL) patients. Among the ongoing Phase 3 studies, the data from Studies 
CT-P10 3.2 (up to Week 24 in Part 1 and Part 2 patients) and CT-P10 3.3 (up to Core Cycle 8 [24 weeks] in Part 
2 patient) is now available. The result of Study  CT-P10 3.4, which  has been  designed to assess therapeutic 
similarity in patients with LTBFL, will be available by 2021. 
The completed studies comprise a  randomised,  controlled  comparison  of  the pharmacokinetics,  efficacy  and 
safety of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with up to two courses of CT-P10 or MabThera (Study CT-P10 
1.1), and an open-label maintenance study in which eligible subjects from Study CT-P10 1.1 were treated with 
CT-P10 for a total cumulative observation interval in both studies for each subject of up to 104 weeks (Study 
CT-P10 1.3).  
In the clinical studies with CT-P10, the current safety population consists of 666 patients who were treated with 
at least 1 dose (full or partial) of CT-P10, Mabthera or Rituxan during any dosing period. For RA indication, safety 
data in a total of 525 patients are available; up to 104 weeks throughout Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3 and 
up to 24 weeks in Study CT-P10 3.2 (Part 2). This includes the limited safety data from 20 patients in Study 
CT-P10 1.3 who switched from Mabthera to CT-P10. Study CT-P10 3.3 provides additional safety data in an 
oncology indication (140 patients with AFL).

Patient exposure 
Exposure data are presented for completed studies only. The safety population consisted of all patients who 
received at least 1 (full or partial) dose of study drug (CT-P10 or Mabthera) during any study period (Core or 
Extension). A total of 122 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were exposed to CT-P10 and 51 to MabThera. The 
safety population of Study CT-P10 1.1 included 153 patients (102 patients and 51 patients in the CTP10 and 
Mabthera groups, respectively). A total of 87 patients who had completed the main Study CT-P10 1.1  were 
enrolled into maintenance study, CT-P10 1.3. Of those patients, 38 (65.5%) patients and 20 (69.0%) patients 
were treated with CT-P10 in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively. A total of 102 subjects received 
at least one dose of CT-P10 in Study CT-P10 1.1 and a total of 58 patients received at least one dose of CT-P10 
in maintenance study, Study CT-P10 1.3.  
The mean (SD) total number of doses received in Study CT-P10 1.1 was 3.2 (1.00) doses and 2.8 (1.01) doses 
in the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively. The mean (SD) total number of does received was similar 
between the 2 treatment groups in the Core Study Period (2.0 [0.10] doses and 2.0 [0.14] doses in the CT-P10 
and Mabthera groups, respectively) and in the Extension study Period (2.0 [0.13] doses and 1.9 [0.29] doses for 
the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively). The mean (SD) total dose administered was similar between 
the 2 treatment groups (3142.56 [1004.55] mg and 2843.14 [1007.42] mg in the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, 
respectively). 
In Study CT-P10 1.3, the mean (SD) total number of doses of CT-P10 was 2.0 (0.30) doses overall and was 
similar  in  the  CT-P10  maintenance  and  the  CT-P10  switch  groups  (2.0  [0.37]  doses  and  2.0  [0.00]  doses, 
respectively). 
The patient exposure and follow-up duration are presented below.

Study CT-P10 3.3 in the AFL population consists of the following periods: Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), Core 
Study Period (up to 8 cycles), Maintenance Study Period (up to 2 years) and Follow-up Period (until death or 3 
years  from  Day  1  of  Cycle  1  of  the  Core  Study  Period  for  the  last  patient).  Drug  exposure  to  CT-P10  are 
summarized for the safety population. Safety data over 8 cycles of the Core Study Period were presented. For 
patients  who  were  early  discontinued  before  the  completion  of  the  Core  Study  Period,  all  collected  data 
regardless of study period are included in the listings for this CSR. The majority of patients in each treatment 
group  had  study  drug  (CT-P10  or  Rituxan)  administered  for  all  8  cycles  during  the  Core  Study  Period  (62 
[88.6%] patients in each treatment group). During the Core Study Period, the mean (SD) relative dose intensity 
(%)  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (97.7  [4.40]  and  98.3  [2.71]  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan 
treatment groups, respectively).

Adverse events 
The  overall  safety  experience  in  the  randomised  controlled  studies  with  CT-P10  in  RA  is  presented.  Studies 
CT-P10 1.1 (and its maintenance Study CT-P10 1.3) and CT-P10 3.2 have shared the same inclusion/exclusion 
criteria for the selection of study population and study design, thus the pooled analyses have been prepared to 
allow review of safety across the RA population. 
Table 29: Overview of Safety Experience in the CT-P10 Studies: Safety Population in RA 
An overall summary of TEAEs in Study CT-P10 3.3 (Core Study Period) is presented for the safety population.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
Study CT-P10 1.1 
In patients with RA in Study CT-P10 1.1, the total number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 
281  in  the  CT-P10  and  142  in  the  Mabthera  group.  The  randomization  allocation  ratio  2:1  resulted  in  a 
significantly greater number of exposed patients in CT-P10 group compared to Mabthera group. TEAEs were 
reported for a total of 116 (75.8%) patients; 73 [71.6%] and 43 [84.3%] in the CT-P10 group and the Mabthera 
group, respectively. All TEAEs reported for ≥ 3% of patients in either treatment group are presented. The TEAEs 
most frequently reported in the CT-P10 arm were upper respiratory tract infection (18.6%), infusion related 
reaction (11.8%), and urinary tract infection (10.8%). The TEAE most frequently reported in the Mabthera arm 
were upper respiratory tract infection (15.7%) and dyspepsia, lower respiratory tract infection and headache 
(each reported in 9.8%). 
The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity and no grade 4 TEAEs were reported. The proportion 
of patients who experienced at least 1 grade 3 TEAE was 14 (13.7%) patients and 10 (19.6%) patients in the 
CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively. The most frequently reported grade 3 TEAEs reported by patients 
was gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2.0%) in the CT-P10 group and intervertebral disc disorder (3.9%) 
in  the  Mabthera  group.  No  other  grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs  were  reported  for  more  than  1  patient  in  either 
treatment group.

AE = any untoward medical occurrence in a patient enrolled (i.e., when the informed consent form [ICF] was signed) into this 
study regardless of its causal relationship to study drug. 
TEAE = any event not present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsened in either intensity or 
frequency after exposure to study drug.  
SAE (or TESAE) = any event that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation  of  existing  hospitalization,  resulted  in  persistent  or  significant  disability/incapacity,  or  was  a  congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.

In patients with RA in Study CT-P10 1.3, the patients who received study drug in Maintenance Study Period were 
9/38 (23.7%) patients in the CT-P10 maintenance group and 4/20 (20.0%) patients in the CT-P10 switch group 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. All TEAEs reported for ≥ 3% of patientswho received study drug in the Maintenance 
Study Period in either treatment group are summarized. TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug were reported for 2 (5.3%) patients and 2 (10.0%) patients in the CT-P10 maintenance group and 
CT-P10 switched group, respectively. The most frequently reported TEAEs in CT-P10 maintenance group were 
upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection (each reported in 2 [5.3%]). In CT-P10 switch group, 
there was no TEAEs reported in more than 1 patient. The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity 
and  no  grade  4  TEAEs  were  reported.  In  Study  CT-P10  1.3,  1  patient  in  the  CT-P10  maintenance  group 
experienced  grade  3  hypertension  and  1  patient  in  the  CT-P10  switch  group  experienced  grade  3  spinal

Pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2) 
In  the  pooled  analysis  for  the  RA  population  (Studies  CT-P10  1.1,  CT-P10  1.3  and  CT-P10  3.2),  all  TEAEs 
reported for ≥ 3% of patients in any treatment group are summarized. The proportions of patients reporting 
TEAEs  were  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups;  172  (60.8%)  and  152  (58.0%)  in  the  Total  CT-P10 
(CT-P10 only + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference products (Mabthera + Rituxan) groups, respectively. Of 
those,  TEAEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug  were  reported  for  97  (34.3%) 
patients and 90 (34.4%) patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 only + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference 
products groups, respectively. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate and their severities were similar 
between the 2 treatment groups. The TEAE most frequently reported was infusion related reaction and upper 
respiratory  tract infection in  the  Total  CT-P10and  the  reference  products  group,  respectively.In  addition,  no 
TEAEs were reported for more than 1 patient in the Switched to CT-P10 group, and no notable increase in any 
particular SOC was observed following transition from Mabthera to CT-P10. Overall, a similar safety profile was 
noted across all SOCs in both treatment groups. 
TESAEs were reported for 26 (9.2%) patients and 16 (6.1%) patients in the Total CT-P10 and the reference 
products groups, respectively. The TESAE considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs were 
reported for 3 (1.1%) patients and 7 (2.7%) patients in the Total CT-P10 and the reference products groups, 
respectively, and there were no related TESAEs that were reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment 
group.  
Nine patients in the each Total CTP10 and the reference products group experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to 
discontinuation. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation was infusion related 
reaction in both Total CT-P10 and the reference products groups, which were reported for 4 patients in each 
treatment group.

The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be related to the 
study drug was similar in the 2 treatment groups (37 [52.9%] patients and 34 [48.6%] patients in the CT-P10 
and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug  were 
neutropenia and IRR (15 [21.4%] patients each) in the CT-P10 treatment group and IRR (17 [24.3%] patients) 
followed by neutropenia (5 [7.1%] patients) in the Rituxan treatment group. 
The majority of TEAEs were the CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity. 
The number of patients who experienced at least 1 grade 4 TEAE considered to be related to the study drug was 
4 (5.7%) patients in each treatment group. The reported grade 4 TEAEs considered to be related to the study 
drug were neutropenia (4 [5.7%] patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 3 [4.3%] patients in the Rituxan 
treatment group) and ileus (1 [1.4%] patient in the Rituxan treatment group). The only reported grade 5 TEAE 
was tumour lysis syndrome which was considered to be related to the study drug (1 [1.4%] patient in the CTP10 
treatment group). 
The  number  of  patients  with  TEAE  of  neutropenia  was  24  (34.3%)  patients  and  16  (22.9%)  patients in  the 
CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively, and the number of patients with CTCAE grade 3 or higher 
of neutrophil counts decreased by the laboratory test was similar between the 2 treatment groups (19 [27.1%] 
patients and 14 [20.0%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). In addition, the 
number (%) of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE of febrile neutropenia was 2 (2.9%) patients in both 
treatment groups. 
Of note, more patients in the CT-P10 treatment group had bone marrow involvement at baseline (45 [64.3%] 
patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 33 [47.1%] patients in the Rituxan treatment group) and among the 
patients with TEAE of neutropenia, 18 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 7 patients in the Rituxan 
treatment group had bone marrow involvement at baseline. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
In CT-P10 studies, an AESI was defined as an event that was infusion-related or was an infection, malignancy 
and/or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
The CT-P10 safety database was screened for all AESIs highlighted as potential and identified risks of Mabthera. 
Some of the risks identified with Mabthera were recorded in few cases only or never occurred in the CT-P10 
Assessment report

clinical programme. Amongst these risks, there were no reports of fatal infections, Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS) / toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN), acute hepatitis B infection or re-activation or HBV de novo, progressive 
multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  GI  perforations,  neurological  disorders  manifesting  as  posterior 
reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES).  Only  few  AESIs  belonging  to  other  groups  of  risks  were  were 
reported  in  the  Studies  CT-P10  1.1  and  CT-P10  1.3:  acute  infusion  related  reactions  (IRRs),  infections, 
opportunistic infections, malignancies and cardiovascular diseases and neutropenia. The safety database was 
systematically assessed to investigate the incidence rate of AESIs (patients with TEAEs/100PY). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) 
Any events, signs or symptoms related to IRRs were reported as various terms by investigators. Considering the 
limitation of capturing these events according to the coded terms, the Applicant applied an expanded definition 
in the clinical development program of CT-P10 to capture all IRRs including those reported as mild and moderate 
in a harmonized, consistent and comprehensive manner. 
For  a  conservative  approach,  2  timeframes  for  IRR  analysis  were  introduced; (i)  events  occurring  during  or 
within 24 hours of each infusion, (ii) events occurring within 7 days of each infusion. Both analyses captured all 
events irrespective of the investigator’s causality assessment. 
Table 40: Definition of IRRs Used in CT-P10 Studies 
Studies with RA Patients: Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3 
In Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3, the proportions of patients experienced at least 1 event of IRRs were 
similar between the treatment groups regardless of the used definition of IRRs and were not increased following 
transition from Mabthera to CT-P10 in Study CT-P10 1.3. The majority of IRR were reported during or following 
the 1st infusion of the 1st treatment course. The frequency of IRR was lower with the 2nd treatment course 
compared with the 1st treatment course, and lower with the 2nd infusion of study drug than with the 1st infusion 
within each treatment course. The numerical variations in the frequency of IRRs in the 2nd course of treatment 
were considered due to the small number of patients received retreatment in both treatment groups. The most 
frequently  reported  sign/symptom  of  IRR  was  headache.  There  were  no  notable  differences  in  the  reported 
symptom between the treatment groups. 
In  Study  CT-P10  1.1,  20  (19.6%)  patients  in  the  CT-P10  and  10  (19.6%)  patients  in  the  Mabthera  groups 
experienced TEAEs of IRRs. Of these, there was no case with fatal outcome, while 1 patient in CT-P10 group 
experienced a severe TEAE of headache and 1 patient in CT-P10 group experienced a TESAE of infusion-related 
reaction. Both severe and serious cases were recovered without sequelae.

The most frequently reported TEAEs of IRRs for patients in the CT-P10 group were infusion related reaction 
(11.8%), headache (4.9%) and dermatitis (2.0%). The most frequently reported TEAEs of IRRs for patients in 
the Mabthera group were infusion related reaction (5.9%) and hypersensitivity, headache and dermatitis (3.9% 
each). No other TEAEs of IRRs were reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment group. 
In Study CT-P10 1.3, among the patients who received study drug in the Maintenance Study Period, 1 patient in 
each treatment group reported TEAEs of IRRs (2.6% and 5.0% in the CT-P10 maintenance and switch groups, 
respectively). No patients reported fatal, serious or severe IRR in Study CT-P10 1.3.

Overall,  most  IRRs  were  of  mild  to  moderate  severity  and  no  fatal  cases  were  reported  throughout  Studies 
CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3. Of those patients who experienced at least 1 event of IRR, 1 patient only in the 
CT-P10 group reported a severe (grade 3) event of headache during or following the 1st infusion of the 1st 
treatment course and this event was considered by the investigator as related to study drug. Severe (grade 3) 
events of IRRs were reported in 2 (2.0%) patients in the CT-P10 group only. While the events of acute kidney 
injury and hypertension were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug, an event of headache 
were considered by the investigator to have probable relationship with study drug. 
The number of patients who experienced at least 1 event of IRRs leading to the permanent study discontinuation 
was  same  throughout  the  definition  of  IRRs  used  and  no  notable  differences  were  observed  between  the 
treatment groups. IRR leading to the permanent study discontinuation were reported for 2 (2.0 %) patients and 
1 (2.0 %) patient in the CT-P10 group and Mabthera group, respectively, and these were moderate (grade 2) 
events  of  infusion  related  reaction  reported  in  the  CT-P10  group  and  moderate  (grade  2)  events  of  rash, 
delusion,  memory  impairment  and  mucosa  vesicle  reported  in  the  Mabthera  group.  All  these  events  were 
considered by investigator to be related to the study drug. 
In  addition,  there  were  similar  proportions  of  patients  experienced  at  least  1  event  of  IRR  requiring  any 
treatment between the treatment groups in any definition of IRR used. The treatment used for IRR included 
antipyretics, antihistamines and glucocorticoids.

Studies with RA Patients: Study CT-P10 3.2 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, a lower proportion of patients with at least 1 event of IRRs in the Rituxan group was noted, 
whereas  results  in  other  treatment  groups  were  generally  similar.  To  understand  this  finding,  additional 
analyses for IRRs were carried out with regards to the use of premedication and ADA status and no clinically 
meaningful differences were observed between the treatment groups or between any type of premedication and 
the occurrence of IRR due to the limited number of patients who did not receive premedication.  
In the sensitivity analysis of Part 1 of Study CT-P10 3.2 (up to Week 24), regardless of the IRR capture algorithm 
used  (Table  1),  a  higher  incidence  of  IRRs  in  the  Mabthera  group  was  noted  compared  to  other  treatment 
groups. 
In  Part  1  of  Study  CT-P10  3.2  up  to  Week  48  (Table  2),  and  in  line  with  findings  up  to  Week  24,  a  higher 
incidence of IRRs in the Mabthera group was observed whereas other treatment groups were generally similar.

Up to Week 48, most IRRs were of mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2) severity and no life-threatening (grade 
4) or fatal (grade 5) cases were reported. Severe (grade 3) events of IRRs were reported in 2 patients in the 
CT-P10 group only during or following the 1st infusion of the 2nd treatment course (at Week 24) and recovered 
without sequelae.

CT-P10 3.2 (Part 2): Safety Population
The incidence of IRRs using new conservative definitions throughout the two treatment courses was similar for 
CT-P10 and Rituxan (20% and 17%, respectively) but slightly higher for MabThera (28%).

Studies with NHL Patients: Core Study Period CT-P10 3.3  
Treatment-emergent AEs due to IRRs were reported for 16 (22.9%) patients and 17 (24.3%) patients in the 
CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The majority of TEAEs due to IRR were grade 1 or 2 in 
intensity. All patients received premedications of either an antipyretic (eg, paracetamol), an antihistamine (eg, 
H1 antihistamine) or a glucocorticoid before the infusion of CT-P10 or Rituxan over the Core Study Period. All 
TEAEs of IRR were grade 1 or 2 in intensity but only 3 TEAEs of IRR were reported as grade 3 in 2 patients in the 
CT-P10 treatment group. There was 1 TEAE of IRR which was reported to be unrelated to the study drug but 
related to the combination chemotherapy in the CT-P10 treatment group. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  considered  as  IRRs  were  reported  for  2  out  of  3  (66.7%)  patients  in  the  CT-P10 
treatment group and 1 out of 2 (50.0%) patients in the Rituxan treatment group those who had a positive ADA 
result. 
Occurrence of IRRs by the ADA presence 
Study CT-P10 1.1 
The proportions of patients reporting IRRs were balanced between ADA positive and negative subgroups.

In study CT-P10 1.1, the incidences of IRRs were evaluated in the subgroup of patients by seroconversion status 
through 2 treatment courses and the result of analysis is presented. In the CT-P10 group, there was a slightly 
higher proportion of patients with IRR observed in the seroconverted subgroup while the opposite trend was 
noted in the Mabthera group. Overall, these new analyses using seroconversion status did not indicate a clear 
trend with regard to the impact of seroconversion status on IRRs.

Table 47: Incidence of IRRs by ADA status at Week 24 in the Study CT-P10 3.2: Safety Population 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, the ADA positive subgroup was defined as patients who developed ADA to rituximab at 
Week 24 regardless of immunogenicity status of Week 0 (pre-dose). The incidences of IRRs by ADA positive or 
negative subgroup were generally comparable between the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups with a slightly lower 
rate in the Rituxan group®. Within the each treatment group, the IRRs were reported with similar proportion 
between the ADA positive and negative subgroups. There was no consistent trend observed in all treatment 
groups across the analysis result. In conclusion, the analyses of IRRs by ADA status in Study CT-P10 3.2 did not

indicate  any  clinically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  or  clear  correlation  between  the 
occurrence of IRRs and ADA status. 
Study CT-P10 3.3  
In Study CT-P10 3.3 (Part 1), the ADA positive subgroup was defined as patients who developed ADA at any time 
after the 1st study drug infusion. A small number of patients were included in ADA positive subgroup; 3 (5.1%) 
patients and 2 (3.2%) patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan groups, respectively. However, the proportions of 
patient with IRR by ADA status were similar between the treatment groups. 
Table 48: Summary of IRRs by ADA status in the Study CT-P10 3.3: Safety Population 
The  majority  of  patients  had  negative  results  for  ADA  test  during  the  Core  Study  Period  (CT-PT  3.3).The 
proportion of patients with positive ADA results was similar in the 2 treatment groups during the Core Study 
Period.  Positive  ADA  results  at  screening  were  reported  for  13  patients  (5  [7.1%]  patients  and  8  [11.4%] 
patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively); however, NAb was negative for all patients. 
A total of 5 patients (3 [4.3%] patients and 2 [2.9%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, 
respectively) had at least 1 positive result for ADA tests at posttreatment visits during the Core Study Period. Of 
them,  3  patients  (2  [2.9%]  patients  and  1  [1.4%]  patient  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan  treatment  groups, 
respectively) were early discontinued from the study treatment and the last infusion of the study drug was at 
Core Cycle 4 for the 2 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and at Core Cycle 2 for the other 1 patient in the 
Rituxan treatment group. Two patients (1 patient in each treatment group) received a full dose of infusion at 
each cycle during the Core Study Period and had positive results at Core Cycle 4 and negative results at Core 
Cycle 8 (EOT1). All patients with ADA positive result at posttreatment visits had positive results for NAb test with 
the exception of 1 patient in the CT-P10 treatment group. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (Identified Risk in NHL/CLL Only) 
Throughout the CT-P10 studies, there was 1 fatal case due to TLS reported in an AFL patient (Study CT-P10 3.3). 
This patient was treated with 1 cycle of CT-P10 in combination with CVP during the study period. Across all 
clinical studies with CT-P10, no other TLS cases have been reported to date.

In Study CT-P10 1.1, TEAEs of infection were reported for 39 (38.2%) patients and 21 (41.2%) patients in the 
CT-P10 and Mabthera groups, respectively. No fatal or severe cases were reported. One patient in each arm 
experienced  a  serious  infection  (diverticulitis  and  lobar  pneumonia),  which  recovered  without  sequelae.  The 
most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  of  infection  for  patients  in  both  CT-P10  and  Mabthera  group  were  upper 
respiratory tract infection (18.6% and 15.7% patients, respectively) and urinary tract infection (11% and 8%, 
respectively).  
In Study  CT-P10 1.3, TEAEs of infection were reported for 3 (7.9%) patients and 2 (10.0%) patients in the 
CT-P10 maintenance and switched groups, respectively. No patients reported fatal, serious or severe infection 
in Study CT-P10 1.3. 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), 80 (28.3%) 
patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) group and 67 (25.6%) patients in the reference 
products (Mabthera + Rituxan) group reported at least 1 event of infection. The majority of events of infections 
were grade 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate) in severity whereas grade 3 (severe) events were reported for 2 (0.7%) 
patients  and  4  (1.5%)  patients  in  the  Total  CT-P10  and  the  reference  products  groups,  respectively.  These 
events include an unrelated event of a urinary tract infection and an unrelated event of gastroenteritis in the 
Total CT-P10 group and 2 related events of pneumonia, an unrelated event of bronchitis and a related event of 
cellulitis in the reference products group. Of those, none of events in the Total CT-P10 group and all events in the 
reference products group were serious. There was 1 fatal event of infection in the Total CT-P10 group which was 
cellulitis. 
Serious events of infections were reported in 3 (1.1%) patients and 4 (1.5 %) patients in the CT-P10 and the 
reference  products  groups,  respectively.  In  the  AFL  population  (Core  Study  Period  CT-P10  3.3), 
treatment-emergent AEs due to infection were reported for 22 (31.4%) patients and 26 (37.1%) patients in the 
CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The majority of TEAEs due to infection were unrelated to 
the study drug. The TEAEs due to infection considered to be related to the study drug were reported for 6 (8.6%) 
patients  in  the  CT-P10  treatment  group  and  9  (12.9%)  patients  in  the  Rituxan  treatment  group.  The  most 
frequently reported TEAEs due to infection in the CT-P10 treatment group were lower respiratory tract infection, 
pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection (5 [7.1%] patients each). The number of patients was 5 (7.1%) 
patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 1 (1.4%) patient in the Rituxan treatment group for each TEAE of 
pneumonia  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection.  In  total,  the  number  of  patients  with  at  least  1  of  the 
respiratory  infections  (influenza,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  tracheobronchitis,  lower  respiratory  tract 
infection or pneumonia) was similar between the 2 treatment groups (16 [22.6%] patients in each treatment 
group). 
The incidence rate of infections in RA and NHL patients was similar between the 2 treatment groups. There were 
no events of serious viral infection (Identified Risk in NHL/CLL) reported throughout the studies with CT-P10.

Opportunistic Infections 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, one (1.0%) patient in CT-P10 group and 3 (5.9%) patients in Mabthera group experienced 
TEAEs of herpes zoster which considered as opportunistic infection. All patients recovered. No fatal, severe or 
serious opportunistic infections were reported in this study. In Study CT-P10 1.3, no patient experienced TEAEs 
considered as opportunistic infection. 
In  the  pooled  analysis  for  the  RA  population  (Studies  CT-P10  1.1,  CT-P10  1.3  and  CT-P10  3.2),  5  (1.8%) 
patients  in  the  Total  CT-P10  (CT-P10  +  Switched  to  CT-P10)  group  and  6  (2.3%)  patients  in  the  reference 
products  (Mabthera  +  Rituxan)  group  reported  at  least  1  event  of  opportunistic  infections.  The  majority  of 
events of opportunistic infections were grade 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate) in severity and grade 3 (severe) and 
serious events of opportunistic infections was reported for 1 (0.4%) patient in the reference products group 
only; a related event of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
In the NHL population (Study CT-P10 3.3), 1 (1.7%) patients in the CT-P10 group and 2 (3.2%) patients in the 
Rituxan groups reported at least 1 event of opportunistic infections. No grade 3 (severe) or serious events were 
reported in either treatment group. 
The incidence rates of opportunistic infections in RA and NHL patients were similar between the 2 treatment 
groups.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
In Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3, there was 1 patient who had a positive test result in the HBV DNA test 
for HBsAb and HBcIg. However, it was not considered as an AE by the investigator. Throughout the CT-P10 
clinical studies, no other patients experienced hepatitis B reactivation or positive HBV DNA results, including the 
ongoing Study CT-P10 3.3. 
Malignant Events 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), patient in the 
reference products (Mabthera + Rituxan) group reported at least 1 event of malignancy. Grade 3 (severe) or 
serious events of malignancy were reported for 1 (0.4%) patient each in the CT-P10 and the reference products 
groups, respectively.(both from Study CT-P10 1.1: a grade 3 and serious event of cervix carcinoma stage 0 and 
a grade 1 and serious event of adrenal neoplasm. The event of adrenal neoplasm was originally reported by 
investigator  as  ‘adrenal  incidentaloma’.  This  event  occurred  15  days  after  the  1st  study  drug  infusion  and 
assessed by the investigator as unrelated with the study drugs. Investigator also considered that this event was 
not malignant and with a follow-up for 1 year, it was confirmed that the both right and left adrenal gland are in 
normal size without abnormal hormone activity. This event was recovered with sequelae. 
An additional malignant event reported for 1 patient in the Total CT-P10 group (Study CT-P10 3.2) was a grade 
1 and non-serious event of thyroid neoplasm. This event was originally reported by the investigator as ‘both 
thyroid nodule’ but coded as thyroid neoplasm. Further follow up on this case will be performed until the end of 
study to confirm actual malignancy. All these malignant events were considered by investigator as not related to 
the study drugs. 
One TEAE classified as malignancy was reported for 1 (1.4%) patient in the Rituxan treatment group in Core 
Study Period CT-P10 3.3.

In Study CT-P10 3.3, there was 1 event of secondary malignancy reported for 1 patient in the Rituxan group and 
considered to be unrelated to the study drug by investigator. This patient experienced the grade 3 (severe) 
event of basal cell carcinoma. 
Neutropenia 
TEAEs of neutropenia and leukopenia were reported in 3 (2.9%) patients in CT-P10 group and 2 (3.9%) patients 
in Mabthera group in Study CT-P10 1.1. All events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug. Of those, only 1 patient in Mabthera  group experienced a severe and serious TEAE of neutropenia and 
discontinued the study permanently. No other severe or fatal case of neutropenia was reported. CTCAE grade 4 
decreased total  neutrophil  counts  were  reported  in  2  (2.0%)  patients  and  3  (5.9%)  patients  in  CT-P10  and 
Mabthera  groups, respectively. Except 1 patient from each treatment group, these CTCAE grade 4 were not 
considered as TEAEs in the opinion of the investigators. In Study CT-P10 1.3, 1 (5.0%) patient in the CT-P10 
switch group reported TEAE of neutropenia and recovered without sequelae and this patient had no TEAE of 
infections. No fatal, severe or serious neutropenia was reported in this study. 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), there was similar 
proportions  of  patients  with  neutropenia  between  the  treatment  groups;  5  (1.8%)  patients  and  3  (1.1%) 
patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference products (Mabthera + Rituxan) 
groups,  respectively.  Of  those,  serious  and  nonserious  grade  3  (severe)  events  were  reported  in  1  (0.4%) 
patient in the reference products group only. 
In  the  NHL  population  (Study  CT-P10  3.3),  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  neutropenia  in  the 
CT-P10  group  was  noted;  13  (22.0%)  and  9  (14.5%)  patients  in  the  CT-P10  group  and  Rituxan  group, 
respectively.  However,  there  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  the 
severe  (grade  3)  or  life-threatening  (grade  4)  events  of  neutropenia;  10  (16.9%)  patient  and  8  (12.9%) 
patients  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan  group,  respectively.  Serious  events  were  reported  for 1  patient  in  each 
treatment groups.

Prolonged B-cell Depletion 
The longest exposure in the clinical studies with CT-P10 covers a period up to 104 weeks (Study CT-P10 1.3). 
The proportion of patients with B cell depletion was similar between CT-P10 and Mabthera groups throughout 
the study. All patients who received study drug in CT-P10studies were followed up until recovery of B-cell or IgM 
(equal to or higher than the LLN or atleast 50% of the baseline value). 
Impact on Cardiovascular Disease 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, 14.7% patients in the CT-P10 group and 13.7% in the Mabthera group experienced TEAEs 
of cardiovascular nature. Of those, 1 patient reported a severe and non-serious TEAE of hypertension, and 4 
(3.9%) patients reported severe and serious events; deep vein thrombosis, mitral valve prolapse, pericardial 
effusion and arrhythmia. All cases were reported in CT-P10 group and recovered without sequelae. In Study 
CT-P10 1.3, 1 (2.6%) patient in the CT-P10 Maintenance group experienced a severe TEAE of  hypertension 
which was ongoing from Study CT-P10 1.1.  
When pooled across CT-P10 studies conducted in RA patients (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), 
the proportion of patients at least 1 event of cardiovascular disease were 25 (8.8%) patient and 14 (5.3%) 
patients in  the  Total  CT-P10  group  (CT-P10  +  Switched  to  CTP10)  and  the  reference  products  (Mabthera  + 
Rituxan) group, respectively. Of those, events considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug 
were reported for 3 (1.1%) patients and 5 (1.9%) patients in the Total CT-P10 group and the reference products 
group, respectively.  
There were 6 serious cardiovascular events reported for each 1 patient in the CT-P10 group only (6 [2.1%] 
patients), but all these events were considered by investigator to be unrelated to the study drug.  
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Study CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), a higher proportion 
of patients have at least 1 risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the Total CT-P10 group; 158 (55.8%) patients 
and 128 (48.9%) patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) group and the reference products 
(Mabthera  +  Rituxan)  group,  respectively.  Among  those  patients  without  any  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular 
disease, the proportion of patients experienced cardiovascular events were similar with 5 (4.0%) patients and 5 
(3.7%) patients in the Total CT-P10 group and the reference products group, respectively. Similar proportions 
of patients reported cardiovascular events in Study CT-P10 3.3 in AFL patients; 2 (3.4%) patients and 4 (6.5%) 
in the CT-P10 and Rituxan groups, respectively with a slightly lower rates in the CT-P10 group. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, mean changes from baseline in IgM, IgG, and IgA were small, and there were no notable 
differences between the 2 treatment groups. 
The dataset of Study CT-P10 1.3 was relatively small but there were no notable differences in the mean change 
from baseline in immunoglobulin level between treatment groups 
Up to Main Week 24 in Study CT-P10 3.2 and Core Cycle 4 (12 weeks) in Study CT-P10 3.3, mean changes from 
baseline in IgM, IgG, and IgA were small at each time point, and there were no notable differences between 
treatment groups. 
Other Observations Related to Safety 
Grade 3 or 4 and Serious Blood and Lymphatic System AEs in Patients > 70 years (Potential Risk in NHL/CLL): 
In the CT-P10 AFL study (CT-P10 3.3), of those patients > 70 years of age, 1 patient (1.6%) experienced grade

3 and serious events of leukopenia in the Rituxan group only. This event was considered by investigator to be 
related to study drug as well as cyclophosphamide.  
Interferon-γ Release Assay (Study CT-P10 1.1 Only): Fourteen patients (13.7%) and 2 patients (2.0%) in the 
CT-P10 group and 5 patients (9.8%) and 2 patients (3.9%) in the Mabthera group had positive IFN-γ results at 
Screening and during the Core Study Period, respectively. One (2.0%) patient in the Mabthera group had an 
indeterminate IFN-γ result at Screening. One (1.0%) patient in the CT-P10 group had an indeterminate IFN-γ 
result during the Core Study Period. 
Chest X-ray for TB Assessment: In Study CT-P10 1.1, the majority of patients had normal chest x-rays at each 
time point. No positive TB results were reported for patients in either treatment groups at any time point in the 
Core or Extension Study Period. One patient in the Mabthera group reported an abnormal, clinically significant 
chest x-ray at Week 24 of the Core Study Period; vascular markings on the lung. One patients in the CT-P10 
group reported compaction of lung parenchyma and atherosclerotic aorta at Week 0 of the Extension Study 
Period.In Study CT-P10 1.3, no abnormal, clinically significant chest x-ray results reported at any time point. 
Impaired Immunisation Response (Identified Risk in All Indications): There  were no cases of vaccine  failure 
reported throughout the CT-P10 clinical studies. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy: In study CT-P10 3.3 (Core Study Period) no TEAEs due to PML 
were reported for patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups. 
Tuberculosis assessment: In study CT-P10 3.3 (Core Study Period) all patients in both treatment groups had 
normal TB assessments at baseline with the exception of 2 (1.4%) patients who had an abnormal, not clinically 
significant assessment in the Rituxan treatment group. At each postbaseline visit all patients in both treatment 
groups had normal TB assessments except 1 patient with the result of abnormal, not clinically significant at 
baseline who permanently discontinued the study treatment due to reactivation of primary tuberculosis in the 
Rituxan treatment group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Study CT-P10 1.1 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, all reported TESAEs are summarized (table 56). A total of 21 patients reported TESAEs; 14 
(13.7%) patients experiencing 17 SAEs in the CT-P10 group and 7 (13.7%) patients experiencing 8 SAEs in the 
Mabthera group. The distribution of TESAEs is aligned with the randomization allocation of 2:1 in the study. The 
TESAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were reported for 3 (2.9%) patients 
and 2 (3.9%) patients in the CT-P10 and Mabthera group, respectively. 
There was only 1 TESAE reported in more than 1 patient (intervertebral disc disorder, 2 [3.9%] patients in 
Mabthera group) and both cases were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. No other 
TESAE was reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment group.

patients reported at least 1 TESAE; 10 (6.2%) patients in the CT-P10 group and 9 (6.0%) patients in the Rituxan 
group. No TESAE was reported in the Mabthera group. TESAEs considered to be related to the study drug were 
reported for 5 (3.3%) patients in the Rituxan group only. The most frequently reported TESAE in the CT-P10 
group was fracture, which was reported for 2 (1.2%) patients, and no other TESAEs were reported for more than 
1 patient in any of the 3 treatment groups.

Pooled Analysis for the RA Population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2) 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), all reported 
TESAEs are summarised. The types and incidences of TESAEs were similar between the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 
only + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference products (Mabthera + Rituxan) groups; 26 (9.2%) and 16 (6.1%) 
in the Total CT-P10 and the reference products groups, respectively. TESAEs were considered to be related to 
the study drug in 3 (1.1%) patients in the CT-P10 group and in 7 (2.7%) patients in the reference product group. 
The TESAEs reported in more than 1 patient in any treatment group were fracture and spinal osteoarthritis (2

patients (0.7 %) each) in the Total CT-P10 group and pneumonia, fracture and intervertebral disc disorder (2 
(0.8%) patients each) in the reference products group. No other TEAEs were reported in more than 1 patient in 
either treatment group. In addition, no TESAEs were reported for more than 1 patient in the Switched to CT-P10 
group,  and  no  notable  increase  in  any  particular  SOC  was  observed  following  transition  from  Mabthera  to 
CT-P10.

Study CT-P10 3.3 (Core Study Period) 
All TESAEs are summarized for the safety population. The number of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE 
was 16 (22.9%) patients and 9 (12.9%) patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The 
proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug was similar in the 2 treatment groups (6 [8.6%] patients and 4 [5.7%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan 
treatment groups, respectively). 
Only 1 patient had a TESAE of cardiac disorder during the Core Study Period in the CT-P10 treatment group. The 
event was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug but caused by underlying cardiac 
disease. There was 1 patient who experienced 10 TESAEs.

Deaths 
There were no deaths reported during the Study CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3. In the ongoing Phase 3 studies with 
CT-P10, 4 deaths were reported; 1 death in Study CT-P10 3.2 conducted with RA patients and 3 death in Study 
CT-P10 3.3 conducted with AFL patients.  
By the data cut-off, a total of 3 deaths were reported in Cores Study Period CT-P10 3.3. Of these, 1 death due 
to an AE was reported after Core Cycle 1 and 2 deaths due to disease progression were reported during the 
Follow-up Period for patients who early discontinued the study treatment in the CT-P10 treatment group. The 
reported  term  of  AE  which  led  to  death  was  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (TLS)  (1  [1.4%]  patient  in  the  CT-P10 
treatment group). One death due to an AE was reported during the Core Study Period. 
Laboratory findings 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, the most common grade 3 finding was increased gammaglutamyltransferase (6 [5.9%] 
patients and 1 [2.0%] patients in CT-P10 group and Mabthera group, respectively). The most common grade 4 
finding was decreased total neutrophils (2 [2.0%] patients and 3 [5.9%] patients in CT-P10 group and Mabthera 
group, respectively). Except 1 patient from each treatment group, these CTCAE grade 4 were not considered as 
TEAEs in the opinion of the investigators. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 135/161 
  
  
 
 
The  most  common  grade  3/4  finding  was  decreased  total  neutrophils:  7  cases  (7%)  and  4  cases  (8%), 
respectively. This was also the most common finding in Study CT-P10 1.3: 3 [8%] patients and 1 [5%] patients 
in the CT-P10 maintenance group and CT-P10 switch group, respectively; none was grade 4. In Study CT-P10 
1.3,  there  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  CT-P10  maintenance  and  the  CT-P10  switch  groups  in 
relation to clinical laboratory parameters. 
For all other haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, the mean changes from baseline in all 
studies  were  small,  and  there  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of 
laboratory parameters had no CTCAE grade (i.e., the post-baseline laboratory result did not satisfy any CTCAE 
grade criteria) or were CTCAE grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate) with transient changes over the time point 
in all clinical studies with CT-P10. 
Study CT-P10 1.1 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, post-baseline CTCAE grade 3 or higher for laboratory results are summarised. The most 
common grade 3 finding was increased GGT (6 [5.9%] patients and 1 [2.0%] patient in CT-P10 and Mabthera 
groups, respectively). The most common grade 4 finding was decreased total neutrophils (2 [2.0%] patients and 
3  [5.9%]  patients  in  CT-P10  and  Mabthera  groups,  respectively)  with  similar  proportions  of  patients  higher 
grade 3 and 4; 7 (6.9%) patients and 4 (7.8%) patients in the CT-P10 and Mabthera group, respectively. 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, 4 of 6 patients with CTCAE grade 3 or higher GGT level increase in the CT-P10 group had 
an ongoing medical history of GGT increase or pretreatment increased GGT level, or predisposing underlying 
diseases. Any predisposing factors and/or other underlying disease/conditions could not be identified for the 
other 2 patients in the CT-P10 group or a patient in the Mabthera group who have CTCAE grade 3 or higher GGT 
levels increase in the study. Excluding these patients with predisposing factors to the increased GGT levels, 
there was no difference observed between the CT-P10 and Mabthera groups. In addition, remaining 2 patients 
who had CTCAE grade 3 or higher result for GGT level increase in the CT-P10 group had received long-term 
NSAID treatment, which is considered as a predisposing factor to increased GGT. 
Only small numbers of patients with severe GGT levels (Grade 3) are observed in Study CT-P10 1.1 with no 
cases of grade 4. In addition, there were no differences in the proportions of patients with severe (grade 3) or 
life-threatening (grade 4) GGT level increase observed in the larger study with RA patients, Study CT-P10 3.2. 
Furthermore, in the Study CT-P10 3.3 conducted in AFL patients, GGT level was not evaluated as GGT level was 
not an interested factor in CT-P10 AFL study, but no notable differences were observed in the proportion of 
patients reporting an event under Hepatobiliary disorder SOC (1 patient in each CT-P10 and Rituxan group) and 
clinical laboratory findings with LFT between the treatment groups. 
A slightly higher rate of the increased GGT levels and decreased total neutrophil counts observed in the CT-P10 
group in Study CT-P10 1.1 are not observed in the pooled safety data across the CT-P10 RA Studies (CT-P10 1.1, 
CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2) which shows no evidence of differences between the CT-P10 and the reference 
products. The laboratory results from Study CT-P10 1.1 on their own need to be viewed with caution due to the 
low number of events and the small number of patients assigned particularly to the Mabthera group as a result 
of the asymmetric randomisation allocation ratio (2:1).

Study CT-P10 1.3 (Maintenance Study of CT-P10 1.1) 
In Study CT-P10 1.3, there were no notable differences between the CT-P10 maintenance and the CT-P10 switch 
groups in relation to clinical laboratory parameters. The grade 3 finding reported in more than 1 patient in any 
treatment  group  were  total  neutrophils,  decreased only  (3  [7.9%]  patients  and  1  [5.0%]  patient  in  CT-P10 
maintenance group and CT-P10 switch group, respectively). Of these patients, only 1 patient in the CT-P10 
switch group was reported as a TEAE. No post-baseline CTCAE grade 4 (life-threatening) laboratory results were 
reported. 
Study CT-P10 3.2 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, post-baseline CTCAE grade 3 or higher for laboratory results are summarised for the safety 
population. The most common grade 3 finding was GGT increased (2 [1.2%] patients in CT-P10 group, 3 [5.0%] 
patients in the Mabthera group and 4 [2.6%] patients in the Rituxan group). Grade 4 findings were reported for 
only 1 (0.6%) patient in the CT-P10 group, which was creatinine clearance (estimated by weight); in the CT-P10 
group. This patient had ongoing medical history of hypothyroidism and reported a TEAE of acute renal failure 
which was considered by investigator to be unrelated to study drug.

Study CT-P10 3.3 
In Study CT-P10 3.3 (Part 1), post-baseline CTCAE grade 3 or higher for laboratory results are summarised for 
the safety population in table 63. The most common grade 3 or higher finding was neutrophil count decreased; 
8 (13.6%) patients and 7 (11.3%) patients in CT-P10 and Rituxan groups, respectively. 
Table 60: Summary of Patients with CTCAE Grade 3 or Higher Laboratory Results in Study CT-P10 
3.3: Safety Population 
There was a notable decrease in both neutrophil and whole blood cell (WBC) count from baseline in both 
treatment groups at each subsequent time point during the Core Study Period. There was no evidence of 
difference in mean change from baseline in all clinical chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters 
between the 2 treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 138/161 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The majority of patients had normal baseline urinalysis results that remained normal during the Core Study 
Period in both treatment groups. The majority of clinical chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters was 
normal (as did not satisfy any CTCAE grade criteria) or was CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity for each 
laboratory parameter and each subsequent time point. 
Patients with CTCAE grade 3 or higher laboratory parameters during the Core Study Period are also summarized 
in table 64. The most commonly reported CTCAE grade 3 or higher laboratory parameter as worst value was 
neutrophil count decreased; grade 3 neutrophil count decreased was reported for 14 (20.0%) patients and 9 
(12.9%) patients and grade 4 was reported for 5 (7.1%) patients and 5 (7.1%) patients in the CT-P10 treatment 
group and the Rituxan treatment group, respectively. The second most commonly reported CTCAE grade 3 
laboratory parameter was white blood cell decreased (6 [8.6%] patients in each treatment group) and the 
following CTCAE grade 4 laboratory parameter was hyperuricemia (1 [1.4%] patient and 3 [4.3%] patients in 
the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively).

Safety in special populations 
Age 
The use of CT-P10 has currently only been documented in studies involving subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 
which is most prevalent in adults and the elderly. Twenty-five subjects over the age of 60 years have been 
treated in clinical studies with CT-P10. Dose adjustments on the grounds of advanced age are not required for 
rituximab. Age had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in patients treated for 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

1 The results are from Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 3.2 in RA patients. Patients whose (Baseline result – post-treatment result) 
equal to or higher than 0.8 for Physical Component Score (PCS) or Mental Component Score (MCS) were categorized into Quality of 
life decrease. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Rituximab is an immunoglobulin. It is not biotransformed in the liver, and does not undergo hepatic excretion. 
There is no evidence of hepatotoxicity in clinical use for the reference product (MabThera SmPC 2015; van 
Vollenhoven et al. 2010). No patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment have been treated in clinical 
trials with CT-P10. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Rituximab does not undergo renal excretion. There is no evidence of nephrotoxicity in clinical use for the 
reference product (MabThera SmPC 2015; van Vollenhoven et al. 2010). No patients with clinically significant 
renal impairment have been treated in clinical trials with CT-P10. 
Sub-populations carrying known and relevant polymorphisms 
FcγRIIIa receptor subtyping was performed on 96 subjects in the rheumatoid arthritis data set exposed to 
CT-P10 in Study CT-P10 1.1 and Study CT-P10 1.3. Approximately equal numbers of subjects with the FcγRIIIa 
FF variant (n=43) and the FcγRIIIa FF+VV variant (n=53) were treated with CT-P10. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Rituximab is not recommended to be administered during pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid 
pregnancy during rituximab exposure and for 12 months after the last treatment has been administered.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed with CT-P10. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent study 
drug discontinuation was similar between 2 treatment groups with 6 (5.9%) patients and 4 (7.8%) patients in 
the  CT-P10  and  Mabthera  groups,  respectively.  The  TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  from  study 
treatments reported in more than 1 patient was infusion-related reaction (2 [2.0 %] patients in CT-P10 group). 
No  other  TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  from  study  treatments  was  reported  for  more  than  1 
patient in either treatment group. 
In  patients  who  received  study  drug  in  Maintenance  Study  Period  (Study  CT-P10  1.3),  no  TEAEs  leading  to 
permanent study drug discontinuation were reported. 
Up to Week 24 in Study CT-P10 3.2, 3 (1.9%) patients in the CT-P10 group, 1 (1.7%) patient in the Mabthera 
group and 4 (2.6%) patients in Rituxan group experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation. 
The most frequently reported TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation was infusion related reaction in all of 
the 3 treatment groups (2 [1.2%] patients in the CT-P10 group, 1 [1.7%] patient in the Mabthera group and 3

[2.0%] patients in the Rituxan group). No other TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation were reported for 
more than 1 patient in any of the 3 treatment groups. 
In the pooled analysis, 9 patients each in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference 
products (Mabthera + Rituxan) groups experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation. The 
most frequently reported TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation was infusion related reaction in both the 
Total CT-P10 and the reference products group, which were reported for 4 patients in each treatment group. 
Up to Core Cycle 4 (12 weeks) in Study CT-P10 3.3, 3 (5.1%) patients in the CT-P10 group and 1 (1.6%) patient 
in the Rituxan group experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation. No TEAEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation were reported for more than 1 patient in the either treatment group. In Core Study 
Period treatment-emergent AEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation were reported for 5 (7.1%) 
patients and 1 (1.4%) patient in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The TEAEs leading to 
permanent study drug discontinuation considered to be related to the study drug were reported for 3 (4.3%) 
patients  and  1  (1.4%)  patient  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan  treatment  groups,  respectively.  Each  TEAE  was 
reported  for  only  1  patient.  Regardless  of  the  relationship  with  the  study  drug  which  was  decided  by  the 
investigators, all patients had risk factors for the TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, except 
one patient who early discontinued the study drug due to infusion-related reaction and the patient had positive 
results for ADA and NAb tests. 
Table 62: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Study Drug Discontinuation 
by System Organ Class and Preferred Term: Safety Population 
Overall, the proportions of patients who reported at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation were similar among 
the treatment groups across all CT-P10 studies and the indications. The comparative analysis did not reveal any 
trends or new signals in the patients treated with CT-P10. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data with CT-P10 are available.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development programme comprises six studies, includes clinical studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and non-Hodgking´s lymphoma (NLH) patients. Among the clinical studies of CT-P10, 2 Phase 1 studies in RA 
have been completed to date, Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3. And 3 Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing, 
which are Study CT-P10 3.2 in RA patients, Study CT-P10 3.3 in advanced follicular lymphoma (AFL) patients 
and Study CT-P10 3.4 in low tumour burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL) patients. 
Studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs): 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, TEAEs were reported for a total of 116 (75.8%) patients (71.6% in the CT-P10 group). The 
TEAEs most frequently reported in the CT-P10 group were upper respiratory tract infection (18.6%), infusion 
related reaction (11.8%), and urinary tract infection (10.8%). Overall, 46 (45.1%) patients in the CT-P10 group 
experienced TEAEs considered to be related to the study drug. The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 or grade 2 
in intensity and no grade 4 TEAEs were reported. The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 grade 3 
TEAE was 13.7% in the CT-P10 group. The most frequently reported grade 3 TEAEs reported by patients was 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2.0%) in the CT-P10 group. No other grade 3 or higher TEAEs  were 
reported for more than 1 patient. 
In  Study  CT-P10  1.3  (Maintenance  Study  of  CT-P10  1.1),  of  those  patients  who  received  study  drug  in  the 
Maintenance Study Period, 9/38 (23.7%) patients in the CT-P10 maintenance group and 4/20 (20.0%) patients 
in the CT-P10 switch group experienced at least 1 TEAE.TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug were reported for 2 (5.3%) patients and 2 (10.0%) patients in the CT-P10 maintenance group and 
CT-P10 switched group, respectively.The most frequently reported TEAEs in CT-P10 maintenance group were 
upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection (each reported in 5.3%). In CT-P10 switch group, 
there was no TEAEs reported in more than 1 patient. All TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the 
study drug.The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity and no grade 4 TEAEs were reported. In 
Study CT-P10 1.3, 1 patient in the CT-P10 maintenance group experienced grade 3 hypertension and 1 patient 
in the CT-P10 switch group experienced grade 3 spinal osteoarthritis. Both TEAEs were considered unrelated to 
study treatment by investigator. No other grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported. 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, 95 (59.0%) patients in CT-P10 group, experienced at least 1 TEAE. Of these TEAEs, the 
most frequently reported was infusion related reaction in CT-P10 group (25 [15.5%] patients). 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), the proportions 
of patients reporting TEAEs were balanced between the treatment groups; 172 (60.8%) and 152 (58.0%) in the 
Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 only + Switched to CT-P10) and the reference products (Mabthera + Rituxan) groups, 
respectively. Of those, TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug were reported for 97 
(34.3%) patients and 90 (34.4%) patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 only + Switched to CT-P10) and the 
reference products groups, respectively. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate and their severities were 
similar between the 2 treatment groups. The TEAE most frequently reported was infusion related reaction in the 
Total CT-P10.  
Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs): 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, a total of 21 patients reported TESAEs; 14 (13.7%) patients experiencing 17 SAEs in the 
CT-P10 group and 7 (13.7%) patients experiencing 8 SAEs in the Mabthera group. The distribution of TESAEs is 
aligned  with  the  randomization  allocation  of  2:1  in  the  study.  The  TESAEs  that  were  considered  by  the 
Assessment report

investigator to be related to study drug were reported for 3 (2.9%) patients and 2 (3.9%) patients in the CT-P10 
and Mabthera group, respectively. 
There was only 1 TESAE reported in more than 1 patient (intervertebral disc disorder, 2 [3.9%] patients in 
Mabthera group) and both cases were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. No other 
TESAE was reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment group. 
In Study CT-P10 1.3, among patients who received study drug in the Maintenance Study Period, 1 patient in 
each treatment group experienced a TESAE of spinal osteoarthritis. Both TEAEs were considered unrelated to 
study treatment by the investigator.No other TESAE were reported. 
In Study CT-P10 3.2, a total of19 patients reported at least 1 TESAE; 10 (6.2%) patients in the CT-P10 group 
and 9 (6.0%) patients in the Rituxan group. No TESAE was reported in the Mabthera group. TESAEs considered 
to  be  related  to  the  study  drug  were  reported  for  5  (3.3%)  patients  in  the  Rituxan  group  only.  The  most 
frequently reported TESAE in the CT-P10 group was fracture, which was reported for 2 (1.2%) patients, and no 
other TESAEs were reported for more than 1 patient in any of the 3 treatment groups. 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), TESAEs were 
reported for 26 (9.2%) patients and 16 (6.1%) patients in the Total CT-P10 and the reference products groups, 
respectively. The TESAE considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs were reported for 3 
(1.1%) patients and 7 (2.7%) patients in the Total CT-P10 and the reference products groups, respectively, and 
there were no related TESAEs that were reported for more than 1 patient in either treatment group.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): 
Only few AESIs belonging to other risks groups were identified in the CT-P10 RA and AFL studies: IRRs, TLS, 
infections,  opportunistic  infections,  malignancies,  cardiovascular  diseases  and  neutropenia.  There  were  no 
reports of fatal infections, PML, SJS/TEN, HBV de novo, GI perforations, neurological disorders manifesting as 
PRES, AML / MDS. 
Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, 20 (19.6%) patients in the CT-P10 group experienced TEAEs of IRRs. Of these, there was 
no case with fatal outcome. The most frequently reported TEAEs of IRRs for patients in the CT-P10 group were 
infusion related reaction (11.8%), headache (4.9%) and dermatitis (2.0%).  
In Study CT-P10 1.3, among the patients who received study drug in the Maintenance Study Period, 1 patient in 
each treatment group reported TEAEs of IRRs (2.6% and 5.0% in the CT-P10 maintenance and switch groups, 
respectively). No patients reported fatal, serious or severe IRR. 
Overall,  most  IRRs  were  of  mild  to  moderate  severity  and  no  fatal  cases  were  reported  throughout  Studies 
CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3. Severe (grade 3) events of IRRs were reported in 2 (2.0%) patients in the CT-P10 
group only. IRR leading to the permanent study discontinuation were reported for 2 (2.0 %) patients in the 
CT-P10 group. 
In  Study  CT-P10  3.2,  the  most  frequently  reported  sign/  symptom  of  IRRs  was  pruritus  and  there  were  no 
notable differences in the reported symptom between the treatment groups. 
Infections 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), 80 (28.3%) 
patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) reported at least 1 event of infection. The majority 
of events of infections were grade 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate) in severity whereas grade 3 (severe) events were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 144/161 
  
  
 
reported for 2 (0.7%) patients in the Total CT-P10. These events include an unrelated event of a urinary tract 
infection and an unrelated event of gastroenteritis in the Total CT-P10 group. Of those, none of events in the 
Total CT-P10 group were serious. There was 1 fatal event of infection in the  Total CT-P10 group which was 
cellulitis. Serious events of infections were reported in 3 (1.1%) patients in the CT-P10.  
Opportunistic Infections 
In  the  pooled  analysis  for  the  RA  population  (Studies  CT-P10  1.1,  CT-P10  1.3  and  CT-P10  3.2),  5  (1.8%) 
patients in the Total CT-P10 (CT-P10 + Switched to CT-P10) group reported at least 1 event of opportunistic 
infections. The majority of events of opportunistic infections were grade 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate) in severity 
No grade 3 (severe) or serious events were reported patients in the CT-P10 group.  
Malignant Events 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), Grade 3 (severe) 
or serious events of malignancy were reported for 1 (0.4%) patient in the CT-P10. An additional malignant event 
reported for 1 patient in the Total CT-P10 group (Study CT-P10 3.2) was a grade 1 and non-serious event of 
thyroid neoplasm.  
Impact on Cardiovascular Disease 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, 14.7% patients in the CT-P10 group experienced TEAEs of cardiovascular nature. In Study 
CT-P10 1.3, 1 (2.6%) patient in the CT-P10 Maintenance group experienced a severe TEAE of  hypertension 
which was ongoing from Study CT-P10 1.1.  
When pooled across CT-P10 studies conducted in RA patients (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), 
the proportion of patients at least 1 event of cardiovascular disease were 25 (8.8%) patients in the Total CT-P10 
group  (CT-P10  +  Switched  to  CTP10),  and  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  have  at  least  1  risk  factor  for 
cardiovascular disease in the Total CT-P10 group; 158 (55.8%) patients in the Total CT-P10.  
Neutropenia 
In the pooled analysis for the RA population (Studies CT-P10 1.1, CT-P10 1.3 and CT-P10 3.2), there was 5 
(1.8%)  patients  in  the  Total  CT-P10  group  with  neutropenia.  In  the  NHL  population  (Study  CT-P10  3.3),  a 
slightly higher proportion of patients with neutropenia in the CT-P10 group was noted; 13 (22.0%).  
Death:  
There  were  no  deaths  reported  during  the  Study  CT-P10  1.1  and  CT-P10  1.3.  One  death  reported  in  Study 
CT-P10 3.2. 
Laboratory findings 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, the most common grade 3 finding was increased GGT (6 [5.9%] patients in CT-P10). The 
most common grade 4 finding was decreased total neutrophils (2 [2.0%] patients in CT-P10) with higher grade 
3 and 4; 7 (6.9%) patients in the CT-P10. 
In Study CT-P10 1.3, there were no notable differences between the CT-P10 maintenance and the CT-P10 switch 
groups  in  relation  to  clinical  laboratory  parameters  (3  [7.9%]  patients  and  1  [5.0%]  patient  in  CT-P10 
maintenance group and CT-P10 switch group, respectively). 
In  Study  CT-P10 3.2, the  most common grade 3 finding was GGT increased (2 [1.2%] patients in CT-P10). 
Grade 4 findings were reported for only 1 (0.6%) patient in the CT-P10 group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 145/161 
  
  
 
No differences in laboratory results were seen when taking into consideration results across all CT-P10 studies. 
Discontinuation due to Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs): 
In Study CT-P10 1.1, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent study 
drug discontinuation was 5.9% in the CT-P10 group. The TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation from study 
treatments reported in more than 1 patient was infusion-related reaction (2.0 % in CT-P10 group). 
In  patients  who  received  study  drug  in  Maintenance  Study  Period  (Study  CT-P10  1.3),  no  TEAEs  leading  to 
permanent study drug discontinuation were reported. 
Up to Week 24 in Study CT-P10 3.2, 3 (1.9%) patients in the CT-P10 group experienced at least 1 TEAE leading 
to permanent discontinuation. The most frequently reported TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation was 
infusion related reaction, 2 [1.2%] patients in the CT-P10 group. 
In  study  CT-P10  3.2,  the  immunogenicity  rate  at  week  24,  which  is  the  only  time  point  with  available 
information, did not appear comparable for the two products. In the randomised part 1 of the study, the ADA 
incidence in the CT-P10 arm (13.6%) was less than half that observed in the MabThera arm (27.6%). 
Study in patients with Advanced Follicular Lymphoma (AFL) 
Core Study Period CT-P10 3.3. 
During the Core Study Period, patients were treated with study drug (CT-P10 or Rituxan) in combination with 
CVP for up to 8 cycles. Patients receiving at least 1 dose of CT-P10 were analyzed under the CT-P10 treatment 
group. Overall, CT-P10 was well tolerated and the safety profile of CT-P10 was comparable to that of Rituxan 
during the Core Study Period. 
TEAEs: Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 58 (82.9%) patients and 56 (80.0%) patients in the CT-P10 
and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the CT-P10 treatment group 
were neutropenia (24 [34.3%] patients) followed by IRR (16 [22.9%] patients) and constipation (12 [17.1%] 
patients). The majority of TEAEs were the CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity. One grade 5 TEAE of tumour 
lysis syndrome was reported in the CT-P10 treatment group. 
Treatment-emergent AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug were reported for 37 
(52.9%) patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 34 (48.6%) patients in the Rituxan treatment group. The 
most frequently reported TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug were neutropenia 
and IRR (15 [21.4%] patients each) in the CT-P10 treatment group and IRR (17 [24.3%] patients) followed by 
neutropenia (5 [7.1%] patients) in the Rituxan treatment group. The number of patients who experienced at 
least 1 grade 4 TEAE considered to be related to the study drug was 4 (5.7%) patients in each treatment group. 
The reported grade 4 TEAEs considered to be related to the study drug was neutropenia (4 [5.7%] patients in 
the CT-P10 treatment group and 3 [4.3%] patients in the Rituxan treatment group) and ileus (1 [1.4%] patient 
in the Rituxan treatment group). 
TESAEs: Treatment-emergent SAEs during the Core Study Period were reported for 16 (22.9%) patients and 9 
(12.9%) patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. The proportion of patients who 
experienced at least 1 TESAE considered by the investigator to be related to the study treatment was similar in 
the 2 treatment groups (6 [8.6%] patients and 4 [5.7%] patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, 
respectively). 
AESI:

Treatment-emergent AEs due to IRRs during the Core Study Period were reported for 16 (22.9%) patients and 
17 (24.3%) patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. 
Treatment-emergent AEs due to infection during the Core Study Period were reported for 22 (31.4%) patients 
and  26  (37.1%)  patients  in  the  CT-P10  and  Rituxan  treatment  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequently 
reported  TEAEs  due  to  infection  in  the  CT-P10  treatment  group  were  lower  respiratory  tract  infection, 
pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection (5 [7.1%] patients each). The most frequently reported TEAEs 
due to infection in the Rituxan treatment group was upper respiratory tract infection (12 [17.1%] patients). The 
number  of  patients  with  at  least  1  of  the  respiratory  infections  (influenza,  upper  respiratory  trac  infection, 
tracheobronchitis, lower respiratory infection or pneumonia) was similar between the 2 treatment groups (16 
[22.6%] patients in each  treatment group). Furthermore, patients who had pneumonia or lower respiratory 
tract infection had risk factors regardless of the relationship with the study drug and they recovered without 
sequalae. 
One  TEAE  classified  as  malignancy  (basal  cell  carcinoma)  was  reported  for  1  (1.4%)  patient  in  the  Rituxan 
treatment group. 
No TEAEs due to PML were reported in either the CT-P10 or the Rituxan treatment group. 
Discontinuation  due  to  TEAEs:  Treatment-emergent  AEs  leading  to  permanent  study  drug  discontinuation 
during  the  Core  Study  Period  were  reported  for  5  (7.1%)  patients  and  1  (1.4%)  patient  in  the  CT-P10  and 
Rituxan treatment groups, respectively. Of these, the number of patients considered to be related to the study 
drug was reported for 3 (4.3%) patients and 1 (1.4%) patient in the CTP10 and Rituxan treatment groups, 
respectively. Regardless of the relationship with the study drug, all of the patients had risk factors for the TEAEs 
leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, except 1 patient who early discontinued due to IRR and had a 
positive result for ADA and NAb tests at Core Cycle 4. 
The proportions of patients who reported at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation were similar among the 
treatment groups across all CT-P10 studies and the indications. The comparative analysis did not reveal any 
trends or new signals in the patients treated with CT-P10. 
Laboratory findings: The majority of laboratory parameters was normal (as did not satisfy any CTCAE grade 
criteria) or was CTCAE grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity for each laboratory parameter and each subsequent time 
point. Neutrophil count decreased was the most common CTCAE grade 3 or higher results laboratory parameters 
during the Core Study Period in the CT-P10 treatment group and the Rituxan treatment group (Grade 3: 14 
[20.0%] patients and 9 [12.9%] patients; Grade 4: 5 [7.1%] patients and 5 [7.1%] patients, respectively). 
The  majority  of  patients  had  negative  results  for  ADA  and  NAb  tests  during  the  Core  Study  Period.  The 
proportion of patients with positive ADA results was similar in the 2 treatment groups during the Core Study 
Period (3 patients and 2 patients in the CT-P10 and Rituxan treatment groups, respectively). Mean IgM, IgG, and 
IgA levels were decreased from baseline through Cycle 8 of the Core Study Period, and there were no notable 
differences  between  the  2  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  patients  had  a  grade  0  or  grade  1  ECOG 
performance status at screening and at each subsequent visit. For other safety assessments, including  vital 
signs, ECG, hypersensitivity monitoring, TB assessment, pregnancy test, and physical examination, there were 
no notable differences between the 2 treatment groups during the Core Study Period. 
Deaths: During the Core Study Period, 1 death due to an AE was reported for a patient in the CT-P10 treatment 
group who died of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). During the Follow-up Period, there were 2 more deaths caused 
by disease progression.

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the CT-P10 treatment group in Core Study Period (AFL patients) were 
neutropenia (24 [34.3%] patients).  
In AFL patients, when compared Part 1 and Part 2 of Study CT-P10 3.3, the safety profile appears shlightly worse 
in Core Study Period (24 weeks) than in Part 1 (12 weeks).  
From the safety database of rituximab all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics which follows the one of Mabthera. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  CT-P10  appeared  roughly  similar  to  that  of  the  reference  product  although  the 
pooled incidences of AEs and SAEs were generally lower for the reference products. Therefore, the available 
safety data are considered supportive of biosimilarity between CT-P10 and MabThera. Most common reported 
events were infections, infusion related reactions. The frequencies and nature of the adverse events were in line 
with those reported for the innovator MabThera/Rituxan in the RA and NLH study populations.  
Although  dataset  of  AFL  patients  has  been  updated,  data  are  still  considered  very  limited  to  reach  firm 
conclusion about safety proflie. Additional safety data from maintenance study period CT-P10 3.3 and follow-up 
period should be provided (see RMP). The planned extension studies CT-P10 3.2 (RA) CT-P10 3.3 (AFL) and 
CT-P10 3.4 (LTBFL) listed in the RMP will provide additional long term safety data.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The applicant has submitted a document for justify that Blitzima is a duplicate licence application of Truxima. 
The bridging report between Truxima and MabThera has already been accepted by the EMA during the review of 
centralised procedure for original MAA of Truxima. There are no significant changes in content and design for the 
proposed patient leaflet (PL) and Truxima PL, except for proprietary name and a few indication-specific 
sections.  Therefore, the company´s justification to not undertake further consultation with target patient 
groups, is considered acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Blitzima (rituximab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The therapeutic context of rituximab is very well described over the years since it first received the MA in the EU 
(2nd June 1998), as Mabthera. 
Truxima (rituximab), being a biosimilar of MabThera is reviewed in the context of its similarity and comparability 
with the reference product. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PK analyses for study CT-P10 1.1 demonstrate that the PK profiles of CT-P10 and MabThera are comparable. In 
addition to the analyses of PK from Study CT-P10 1.1, which compared CT-P10 and Mabthera, Study CT-P10 3.2, 
which compared CT-P10, Mabthera and Rituxan, and Study CT-P10 3.3, which compared CT-P10 and Rituxan, 
support  the  conclusion  of  PK  similarity.  In  addition,  PK  data  in  both  RA  and  AFL  patients  support  the 
extrapolation to all other indications. 
In study CT-P10 1.1. mean B-cell levels BLOQ (20 cells/μl) were reached at the end of infusion in the CT-P10 
arm. All patients but one in the Mabthera arm had reached levels below 20 cells/μl within 15 minutes after 
infusion end. In both study arms B-cell counts consistently remained below 20 cells/μl until week 16 for the 
majority of patients. In study CT-P10 3.2. the B-cell counts from all patients, except one in the CT-P10 group, 
decreased to below the LLoQ (20 cells/μL) immediately after the 1st infusion and then remained below this level 
up to Week 24 in the majority of patients in all treatment groups.  
In study CT-P10 3.3. in AFL patients, a sharp decrease was observed in mean B-cell counts 1 hour  after the end 
of infusion at Core Cycle 1 and a complete depletion (below LLoQ) was achieved at Cycle 4 for both CT-P10 and 
Rituxan treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 155/161 
  
  
 
On the basis of the clinical data submitted from the Study CT-P10 1.1 and 3.2, both treatments seem similar in 
terms of ACR up to week 24. Regarding the change from baseline in the disease activity measured by DAS28 in 
Study CT-P10 1.1 and 3.2, the analyses carried out by the applicant meet the criteria for therapeutic equivalence 
according to the equivalence margin of 0.60.  
In the study 3.3, in terms of the ORR 1999 IWG criteria (central review) both in PP and ITT population, the 
difference lies within 7% (4.3% and 5.7% PP and ITT respectively), therefore comparability to the reference 
rituximab is demonstrated.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the Oncology setting, analyses on ORR as per the 2007 IWG criteria, time-to-event parameters including PFS, 
TTP, TTF, response duration, DFS and OS will be submitted when available and in the case of PFS and OS, yearly 
updates will be required (see RMP) as patients who experienced CR, CRu, or PR after Cycle 8 of the Core Study 
Period will enter in the Maintenance Study Period with Rituximab monotherapy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The type and incidence of ADRs to CT-P10 and the reference product were broadly comparable and for most in 
line with those expected on the basis of the MabThera SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  are  inherent  limitations  due  to  the  size  of  the  biosimilar  product  safety  database  for  the  purpose  of 
characterization and evaluation of rare events of special interest.  
The  clinical  relevance  of  Human  anti-chimeric  antibodies  (HACA)  formation  in  rituximab-treated  patients 
remains not fully understood. In general, the proportion of patients with positive ADA titres was similar in the 
CT-P10 and MabThera treatment groups during the study. The majority of patients had negative ADA test results 
at each time point in Studies CT-P10 1.1 and CT-P10 1.3. However, in study 3.2 (part 1) the HACA incidence at 
week 24 (only time point available) in the CT-P10 arm (13.6%) was less than half that observed in the MabThera 
arm (27.6%). 
Otherwise, the safety profile of the two products appears broadly comparable except for a higher number of 
infusion  related  reaction,  nausea,  vomiting,  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (pyrexia), 
neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection dizziness and rheumatoid arthritis in the 
CT-P10 arms. These numbers are too small to conclude at this stage; longer term data and a larger database in 
the post-marketing setting are required. Additional safety data from Maintenance Study Period CT-P10 3.3. (up 
to 2 years) and Follow-up Period (until death or 3 years from Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Core Study Period for the 
last patient) will be provided (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A comprehensive biosimilarity exercise, which covered all relevant structural and functional characteristics of 
the rituximab molecule, was submitted. The presented results support the biosimilarity claim; similarity 
between CT-P10 and the EU reference product MabThera is considered demonstrated at the quality level. Any 
minor differences observed have been adequately justified with respect to the efficacy/safety profile of Truxima.  
Based on the data submitted, in terms of ACR criteria and importantly in terms of DAS28 it could be reasonable 
to assume the similarity of both products. The similarity based on the margin of ± 0.6 for analysis of therapeutic 
equivalence in CT-P10 1.1 and 3.2 studies was met. In addition, both products seem to obtain similar results in 
the individual components of ACR criteria.  
Both the PK package and  the pivotal efficacy trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ACR20 at week  24) 
achieved their respective primary and important secondary endpoints (e.g. DAS28 and ACR 20 across whole 
study period) which is considered crucial for the biosimilar exercise and support the extrapolation to all other 
indications. From a clinical point view, rheumatology studies point out a clear similarity based on DAS28 and 
ACR criteria. 
From an oncology perspective, and bearing in mind the extrapolation to oncology indications, the objectives of 
study CT-P10 3.3 were to demonstrate similarity in pharmacokinetics and non-inferiority in efficacy of CT-P10 to 
Rituxan as primary endpoints when coadministered with CVP in patients with advanced FL. Overall and in the 
framework of supportive data from study CT-P10 3.3, these objectives have been met. The oncology study in 
AFL highlight the similarity based on ORR after 8 cycles of treatment. The latter would support the extrapolation 
to oncology indications. The results from all other efficacy endpoint in Study CT-P10 3.3 will be available with the 
final CSR by 4Q/2019. 
Additionally, the safety profile of Truxima seems similar compared to Mabthera with any observed differences in 
antibody  formation  not  having  any  clinical  meaningful  impact  on  the  efficacy.  Updates  on  safety  will  be 
submitted with the final CSRs of the ongoing studies (see RMP). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk conclusion is based on the totality of evidence collected from the quality, 
non-clinical, and clinical comparability exercise. For Truxima the benefit-risk is considered positive based on the 
submitted data. 
The acceptance of a biosimilar product is based on the overall similarity of quality, pharmaco-toxicological, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects and clinical efficacy and safety. This includes comprehensive 
physicochemical, biological characterisation and comparison and requires knowledge on how to interpret any 
differences between a biosimilar and its reference medicinal product. Any observed differences have to be 
justified also with regard to their potential effect on efficacy and safety of the biosimilar medicinal product.  
Biosimilarity at quality level was demonstrated on the basis of a very comprehensive comparability exercise. 
From a non-clinical perspective comparative PD, PK and toxicokinetic data between Truxima and the reference 
product Mabthera demonstrated biosimilarity.  
PK data in both RA and AFL patients support biosimilarity and the extrapolation to all other indications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/421793/2017  
Page 157/161 
  
  
 
 
The efficacy of Truxima was shown to be similar to that of Mabthera in the primary endpoint (ACR20, week 24) 
and the other secondary endpoints. Therefore these results are sufficient to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy 
between the proposed biosimilar Truxima and the reference product Mabthera.  
Extrapolation of these conclusions other authorised indications for rituximab is sufficiently justified.  
Finally, with regards to safety, the adverse event profiles, clinical laboratory data, and other safety parameters 
did not show any significant safety issues which are not expected with rituximab treatment. There were no 
obvious relevant differences in the safety profile of Truxima as compared to Mabthera with no obvious no 
indication of any safety imbalance in disadvantage of Truxima. The safety outcomes obtained with Truxima in RA 
and AFL patients can be reasonably extrapolated to the other approved therapeutic indications of EU Mabthera. 
There appears to be no relevant differences in the safety profile of rituximab throughout the approved 
therapeutic indications. As a biosimilar, the safety-related product information for Mabthera also applies to 
Truixima. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of Truxima seems highly comparable to Mabthera with the inherent limitations 
due to the lack of data in the long run, which is not considered worrisome in itself. Additional long term safety 
data will be provided from the extension studies through RMP measures.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
With regards to the efficacy, it is well established that the mechanism of action and PD aspects are common 
across autoimmune and across oncology indications of Mabthera.  Therefore, and in line with the EMA guidelines 
on the similar biological medicinal products, the efficacy results obtained with Truxima, demonstrating 
equivalence of Truxima and Mabthera in RA and AFL patients can be reasonably extrapolated to the other 
approved therapeutic indications of Mabthera. 
The applicant intends to claim the same therapeutic indications for adult patients for the biosimilar Truxima as 
granted for Mabthera for iv administration in the EU. However, as Mabthera is also marketed in the 
subcutaneous indication, a risk of medication error has been identified. Adequate risk minimisation measures to 
avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in the RMP.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The application for Blitzima was submitted, in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as 
a duplicate of Truxima authorised on 17 February 2017. 
The overall Benefit Risk balance is considered positive in the following claim indications: 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
Blitzima is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma 
in combination with chemotherapy. 
Blitzima maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy. 
Blitzima monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are 
chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy.

Blitzima, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult patients with 
severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Blitzima is not similar to Imbruvica (Ibrutinib), Arzerra 
(Ofatuzumab), Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) and Venclyxto (Venetoclax) within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Blitzima is favourable in the following indication: 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
Blitzima is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III IV follicular lymphoma in 
combination with chemotherapy. 
Blitzima maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to 
induction therapy. 
Blitzima monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III IV follicular lymphoma who are 
chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
Blitzima is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) 
chemotherapy. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated

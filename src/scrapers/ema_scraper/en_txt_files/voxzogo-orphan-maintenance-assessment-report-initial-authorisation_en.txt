2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2012 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing vosoritide was considered 
justified based on pre-clinical studies showing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation leading 
to widening of the growth plates and skeletal growth;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to manifestations such as otolaryngeal system 
dysfunction, and rhizomelic short stature, thoracolumbar kyphosis, spinal stenosis, and foramen 
magnum stenosis and life-threatening with approximately 10 years shorter life expectancy 
compared to the general population; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, associated with activating mutations in the 
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This mutation results in defects in long bone 
growth resulting in short stature and other skeletal deformities described below. 
The most common mutation (p.G380R) is linked to a region in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 of 
approximately 98% of achondroplasia patients and leads to ligand-dependent hyperactivation of the 
receptor by increasing the residence time of the receptor on the membrane thereby contributing to 
increased signalling (Laederich et al, 2010; Monsonego-Ornan et al, 2000; Bonaventure et al, 1996). 
Increased FGFR3-mediated signalling inhibits differentiation of the growth plate chondrocytes of long 
bones and select intramembranous bones leading to short stature, narrowing of the spinal canal 
(foramen magnum), spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Voxzogo is indicated for the treatment of achondroplasia in 
patients 2 years of age and older whose epiphyses are not closed. The diagnosis of achondroplasia 
should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of Achondroplasia”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Among the most serious and fatal consequences of achondroplasia are respiratory disorders that lead 
to increased mortality among infants. Studies have reported up to a 6-fold higher mortality among 
infants <1 year of age compared to the general population in recent decades (Simmons et al, 2014; 
Hecht et al, 1987). Among age groups the standardized mortality ratio (mortality of disease population 
compared to healthy population within the age group) was highest among infants age 0 to 4 years, 
with deaths most frequently attributed to sudden infant death related to respiratory complications. 
Overall survival and the average life expectancy have been reported to be decreased by up to 10 years 
compared to healthy populations. 
The skeletal growth abnormalities from achondroplasia also result in significant respiratory 
complications, most notably a high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing. 
Neurologic complications associated with spinal stenosis also persist throughout life. Lumbosacral spine 
stenosis with resulting intermittent spinal claudication or overt stenosis (with asymmetric lower 
extremity strength, gait changes, and bladder or bowel incontinence) has been found to develop in 
older children and adults (Pauli et al, 1998). Approximately 36% of patients with lumbar stenosis 
require decompression surgery (Okenfuss et al, 2020). 
Musculoskeletal impairments arising from disproportionate limb-to-trunk ratios result in limited reach 
and range of motion, mobility, and impaired independent self-care, lumbosacral lordosis with 
subsequent back pain and muscle fatigue (Ireland et al, 2014). 
Otolaryngology complications are also frequently present. Achondroplasia is also associated with long 
term psychosocial consequences. 
The condition is therefore associated with both chronically debilitating and life-threatening aspects. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be approximately 0.4 per 10,000.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000. Based on 
the European literature (Table 1) the prevalence ranges from 0.08 to 0.48 per 10,000. 
These estimates have been derived also by using the formula P=I*D (incidence * duration). Incidence 
was calculated using the reported birth prevalence multiplied by the number of country-specific live 
births.  Duration was calculated as the mean years of survival for individuals with achondroplasia (59.6 
years), using data from Wynn et al, 2007.  Complete point prevalence is the appropriate measure for 
achondroplasia since it is an inborn error lasting for life.  As such, complete point prevalence was 
defined as the total number of prevalent achondroplasia cases in a predefined population, divided by 
the sample size of the predefined population, multiplied by 10,000.  For both country-specific live 
births and population, 2019 data were used as it represents the most recent year of complete data 
reporting for both measures.   
The sponsor considers the recently published study from the EUROCAT registry (Coi et al., 2019) to 
represent the highest quality of evidence for the prevalence of achondroplasia in Europe, reporting a 
birth prevalence of 0.31 per 10,000 affected live births, which predicts a complete point prevalence of

Page 5/9 
 
 
 
 
 
0.18 per 10,000 in 2019. All other point prevalence estimates based on European literature range from 
0.08 to 0.48 per 10,000.

The COMP agreed that not much has changed since the orphan designation and that a prevalence of 
0.4 in 10,000 is still suitable.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
No medicinal products are authorised in the EU for this condition.  
Current treatments are mainly limited to surgical interventions, including cervicomedullary 
decompression for foramen magnum stenosis and laminectomy surgery for spinal canal stenosis, and 
medical devices such as thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis (Shirley, 2009).  
However, there is no established therapy that improves growth as well as body proportionality while 
also decreasing the burden of complications (Kubota et al, 2020).  
Significant benefit 
Not applicable, since there are no satisfactory methods currently authorised in the EU for treatment of 
patients with achondroplasia.

4.  COMP position adopted on 25 June 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of achondroplasia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to manifestations such as hypotonia, otolaryngeal 
system dysfunction, and rhizomelic short stature, thoracolumbar kyphosis, spinal stenosis, and 
foramen magnum stenosis and life-threatening with approximately 10 years shorter life 
expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Voxzogo, modified recombinant 
human C-type natriuretic peptide, vosoritide for treatment of achondroplasia (EU/3/12/1094) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

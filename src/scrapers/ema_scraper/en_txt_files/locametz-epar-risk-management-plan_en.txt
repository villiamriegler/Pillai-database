radiopharmaceutical preparation 
Summary of mode of action: Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide binds to cells 
that  express  PSMA,  including  malignant  prostate  cancer  cells,  which 
over express PSMA. Gallium (68Ga) is a radionuclide with an emission 
yield that allows PET imaging. 
25 micrograms 
for 
kit 
information  about 
its  composition:  Gallium  (68Ga) 
Important 
gozetotide solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless solution for 
intravenous  administration,  without  undissolved  matter  and  with  pH 
between  3.2  to  6.5.  After  reconstitution,  the  gallium  (68Ga)  gozetotide 
solution  for  injection  also  contains  hydrochloric  acid  derived  from  the 
gallium-68 chloride solution. 
Physical  Characteristics:  Gallium-68  decays  with  a  half-life  of  68 
minutes to stable zinc-68. Details on principle radiation emission data, 
and physical decay of gallium-68 are discussed in Table 4-6 and Table 
4-7.

Diagnostic  agents  do  not  lend  themselves  to  traditional  epidemiological  assessments  of 
incidence and prevalence. As such, the data which follow focus on prostate cancer specifically. 
Incidence: 
Overall, the reported age-standardized incidence of prostate cancer in Europe ranged from 63.4 
per 100,000 using GLOBOCAN data (Ferlay et al 2020) to 100.0-130.0 per 100,000 in France 
and Germany (Smith-Palmer et al 2019). The age-adjusted incidence reported for the US ranged 
from 73.3 per 1000,000 in men, based on GLOBOCAN data (Ferlay et al 2020), to 115.3 per 
100,000 for the US “SEER 9 areas” (Howlader et al 2020). In regions other than Europe and 
the  USA,  the  age-standardized  PC  incidence  ranged  from  an  annual  incidence  of  4.5  per

(Radwan et al 2018), to an age-standardized incidence of 70.3 per 100,000 in Oceania based on 
GLOBOCAN data (Ferlay et al 2020).

reported)

Prevalence: 
Europe 
Ferlay et al 2020 analyzed GLOBOCAN data and provided estimated numbers of prevalent PC 
cases in 2020 among all age groups. The GLOBOCAN data indicate that in 2020 the prevalence 
was 518.1 per 100,000 within Europe. Accordingly, Europe has the highest reported prevalence 
estimate amongst all GLOBOCAN data-based prevalence estimates. 
United States 
Data from the SEER Program (Howlader et al 2020) showed age-specific (crude) prevalence 
estimates  on  PC.  The  United  States  cancer  prevalence  estimates  on  1st  January  2017  were 
900,214 cases diagnosed 0 to 5 years before. With respect to complete estimates, there were 
3,170,339 men of all races living with PC in the United States in 2017. The counts are based on 
2017 cancer prevalence proportions from the “SEER 13 Areas” (excluding the Alaska Native 
Registry) and 1st January 2017 US population estimates based on the average of 2016 and 2017 
population estimates from the US Bureau of the Census. More recent data from 2020 from the 
GLOBOCAN  program  show  a  prevalence  of  509.3  per  100,000  among  all  age  groups  in 
Northern America, which is the second highest prevalence estimate in the world region after 
Europe (Ferlay et al 2020). 
Rest of World 
Overall, the PCa prevalence estimates based on GLOBOCAN data (Ferlay et al 2020) in other 
regions in the world vary from 416.9 per 100.000 in Oceania, over 220.5 per 100.000 in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, to 49.6 per 100.000 in Asia, 6.9 per 100,000 in Africa, and 5% in 
Pakistan (Idrees et al 2018). (Idrees et al 2018) conducted a meta-analysis including data from 
1994-2016 on PCa in Pakistan and showed that the prevalence of PC ranged from 2% to 8%, 
with an overall pooled prevalence estimate of 5%. An overview of prevalent PC cases among 
all  age  groups  for  all  world  regions  based  on  GLOBOCAN  2020  data  is  provided  by 
(Ferlay et al 2020). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Prostate cancer incidence increases with age. Although only 1 in 350 men under the age of 50 
years will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the rate increases up to 1 in every 52 men for ages 
50 to 59 years, and peaks even higher in the elderly. Nearly 60% of all prostate cancers are 
diagnosed in men over the age of 65 years. African-American men have the highest incidence 
of prostate cancer worldwide, are more likely to develop disease earlier in life when compared 
to other racial and ethnic groups, and are also prone to be diagnosed with more aggressive type 
of prostate cancer compared to White men. Rates are also very high among Caribbeans, and 
Black men in Europe, suggesting that they possess a common genetic background more prone 
to the development of the cancer (Rawla 2019).

Multivariate analyses showed that high occupational physical activity (AOR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3-
35. 1), history of prostatitis (AOR 31.5, 95% CI 9.2-170.5), and old age (over 80 years vs 70 or
young,  AOR  299.1,  95%  CI  5.3-16985.9)  were  associated  with  higher  risk  of  PC
(Hosseini et al 2010).
Obesity  in  general  was  found  to  be  associated  with  more  aggressive  PC  with  higher  risk  of 
biochemical  recurrence  (HR  =  1.20,  p  =  0.026),  risk  of  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer 
(CRPC) (HR = 2.12, p = 0.026) and risk of PCSM (HR 3.38, p = 0.0170) (Vidal et al 2017). 
Another study showed similar results where high BMI was associated with a trend for greater 
risk  of  progression  to  CRPC  (HR:  3.36,  95%  CI:  0.96-11.71,  p=0.063),  risk  of  developing 
metastases (HR: 3.58, 95% CI: 0.77-16.65, p=0.027) and a trend toward worse PCSM (HR: 
8.21 95% CI: 0.97-69.72, p=0.119) (Keto et al 2012). 
The main existing PET imaging agents: 
The European Commission granted a marketing authorization valid throughout the European 
Union for Axumin on 22-May-2017. The active substance in Axumin, fluciclovine (18F), works 
by entering prostate cancer cells via structures (LAT-1 and ASCT2) that are present in high 
numbers on the surface of these cells. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: 
Mortality data in prostate cancer is limited across EU. (Morgan et al 2010) reported mortality 
of CRPC in the UK. Following the onset of CRPC, the mortality rate was 201.2 per 1,000 patient 
years compared with 86.7 per 1,000 for non-CRPC (Morgan et al 2010).  
Helgstrand and colleagues reported five-year mortality in men with newly diagnosed mPC. The 
5-year  overall  mortality  in  the  Danish  Prostate  Cancer  Registry  (DaPCaR)  cohort  after
diagnosis of de-novo metastatic PC was 78.5% (95% CI, 77.4%-79.5%). In the DaPCaR cohort,
5-year PC-specific mortality significantly decreased from 73.4% (95% CI, 71.2%-75.6%) for
patients  who  were  diagnosed  during  1995  through  1999  to  56.8%  (95%  CI,  54.8%-58.8%;
p<.0001) for the patients diagnosed during 2005 and 2009 (Figure 28) (Helgstrand 2018).
Five-year PCmortality was stable in the US for men diagnosed with de novo mPC from 1980-
1994 and increased slightly for the 2005-2008 period; whereas, it decreased significantly by 
16.6%  (p<.0001)  in  the  DaPCaR  cohort  from  diagnosis  period  1995-1999  to  2005-2009 
(Helgstrand 2018). 
The majority of men with localized PC died from other reasons (n=11,228, 23.9%) than PC 
(n=4058, 8.6%) during 1985-1994, while the majority of men with metastatic disease (48%) 
died from PC during the same period (Seikkula et al 2017). 
Palliative  radiation  was  the  most  common  symptomatic  skeletal  event  (83%),  followed  by 
spinal cord compression (10%), pathological fracture (6%), and surgery to bone (1%) with the 
majority of the patients having ≥2 symptomatic skeletal-related events (Saad et al 2018).

Important co-morbidities: 
In a recent population-based study, patients with prostate cancer had a significantly higher risk 
of  developing  cardiovascular  conditions  (hazard  ratio  1.37,  95%  CI:  1.26–1.48),  depression 
(1.86, 95% CI:  1.73–2.01), diabetes (1.30,  95% CI: 1.15–1.47), gastric  acid disorders (1.48, 
95% CI: 1.39–1.57), hyperlipidaemia (1.18, 95% CI: 1.09–1.29), osteoporosis (1.65, 95% CI: 
1.48–1.85)  and  pain/pain-inflammation  (1.47,  95%  CI:  1.39–1.55)  compared  to  the  control 
patients. Notably, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular conditions and depression were highest 
in the first year and declined over time (Ng et al 2018).  
Additionally,  a  longitudinal  population-based  cohort  study  in  the  General  Practice  Research 
Database of the UK found that compared with men with similar age but no prostate cancer, PC 
patients had higher incidence of urinary tract infection, impotence and breast disorder, and a 
2.6-fold higher all-cause mortality (Li et al 2012).

Single and repeat-dose toxicity: 
Single dose GLP toxicity studies of gozetotide in rats provided 
a systemic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) at the 
highest doses tested (1.33 mg/kg).  
Based  on  the  current  available 
is  no 
non-clinical  data, 
concern relevant to human usage. 
there 
This dose level provides a safety margin based on body 
surface area conversion of approximately 530-fold relative to 
the potential maximum human mass dose (25 µg) in a 1.7 m2 
patient.  
Reproductive/Developmental toxicity 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is a microdose radiodiagnostic, 
therefore no reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
were conducted with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide or the gozetotide 
precursor as they are not required according to the relevant 
guidelines: CHMP Guideline on the nonclinical requirements for 
radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) and 
Microdose Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs: Nonclinical 
Study Recommendations (Guideline for Industry, FDA August 
2018). 
Carcinogenicity  
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is a microdose radiodiagnostic, 
therefore no carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide or the gozetotide precursor as they 
are not required according to the relevant guidelines: CHMP 
Guideline on the nonclinical requirements for 
radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018) and 
Microdose Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs: Nonclinical 
Study Recommendations (Guideline for Industry, FDA August 
2018). 
Genotoxicity 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is a microdose radiodiagnostic,

An in silico bacterial mutagenicity study was performed which 
indicated that gozetotide was not a bacterial mutagen and 
could be treated as a non-mutagenic compound (See results in 
Section 4.7).

Safety Pharmacology: 
Cardiovascular  
Gozetotide was negative in the in vitro hERG and the in vivo 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in minipigs after 
administration of single doses up to 0.29 mg/kg.  
Nervous system 
There were no effects of gozetotide on behavioral, neurologic or 
autonomic parameters in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats after a 
single dose administration of up to 0.75 mg/kg. 
Respiratory system 
There were no effects of gozetotide on respiratory parameters 
in male SD rats after a single intravenous administration of up 
to 0.75 mg/kg. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No DDI studies were required with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide or 
the PSMA-11 precursor, however in vitro assessments have 
been carried out with PSMA-11 in lieu of 68Ga-PSMA-11. 
Based on the current available

Studies included in the clinical development program: 
As of the data cut-off (27-Jan-2021), the safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide for 
identifying  patients  amenable  to  PSMA-targeted  therapy  were  established  in  study 
PSMA-617-01 (VISION). 
PSMA-617-01 (VISION): An international, prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized 
Phase 3 study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with progressive PSMA-positive 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 
The alternate primary efficacy endpoints of the VISION clinical study were overall survival 
(OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by blinded independent central review 
per PCWG3 criteria. 
As of data cut-off (27-Jan-2021), a total of 1003 adult male patients received gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide  at  median  dose  per  body  weight  of  1.9  MBq/kg  (range:  0.9-3.7  MBq/kg)  and 
underwent  PET/CT  image  acquisition  at  approximately  60  minutes  (range:  50-100  minutes) 
after  injection.  Gallium  (68Ga)  gozetotide  PET/CT  scans  were  assessed  in  conjunction  with

Clinical impact on patient 
management: 
The detection of PSMA-positive 
lesions leads to changes in 
treatment plans 
Impact on clinical outcome: 
A retrospective study by (Woythal et al 2018) showed that 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET detects PSMA expression 
and differentiates the higher extent of PSMA expression in 
cancerous prostate from that of normal prostate (a 
significantly higher mean SUVmax 14.06 ± 15.56 vs. 2.43 ± 
0.63; p < 0.001), with high sensitivity (97%) and specificity 
(90%). 
A prospective study from (Basha et al 2019) showed that 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET detects PSMA expression in 
primary prostate cancer tumors with high sensitivity and can 
correctly identify PSMA-positive prostate cancer during 
primary staging. 
The  reliability  of  gallium  (68Ga)  gozetotide  PET  scan  reads 
supports  use  in  identifying  PSMA-positive  lesions,  based  on 
the results published literature. (Landis and Koch 1977) 
In van Kalmthout et al 2020, 103 adult male patients with 
biopsy-proven prostate cancer and intermediate- and 
high-risk features indicated for extended pelvic lymph node 
dissection (ePLND) underwent gallium (68Ga) gozetotide 
PET/CT imaging. PET/CT scans were read by two 
independent blinded readers and ePLND was the 
histopathology reference standard for 96 out of 103 (93%) 
patients. 
Ability of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT to detect prostate 
cancer lesions that are not detected by other methods leads 
to more accurate staging and restaging (vs. 
comparator/conventional imaging) and has major impact on 
the planned treatment for patients with prostate cancer was 
demonstrated in studies (Fendler et al 2020, 
Hofman et al 2020). 
Given the acknowledged diagnostic performance of 
gozetotide, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT scans have

The  majority  of  the  clinically  important  exclusion  criteria  in  the  pivotal  VISION  trial  are

Rationale for not including as

This is not an easily identifiable 
population. It would be expected to be 
such a small number of patients that 
the missing information would not 
impact the benefit-risk profile.  
It is proposed to include 
hypersensitivity as a potential risk, 
however, in patients who are not 
known to have prior relevant 
hypersensitivities. 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is 
administered as a single, low dose 
injection, with a maximum total peptide 
mass dose of 25 micrograms. 
Additionally, 68Ga has a short physical 
half-life (68 mins), and shorter effective 
half-life of 54 minutes, and the 
resulting radiation as a result of a 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide
administration is considered minimal. 
Based on these two considerations, an 
increase in exposure due to renal 
impairment would not be expected to 
compromise patient safety. 
Patients with 
severe renal 
impairment 
No 
gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide is

Hypersensitivity 
Injection site 
reactions 
Kidneys are a primary site of PSMA uptake, and gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is 
rapidly excreted through the kidneys. However, given the microdose of gallium 
(68Ga) gozetotide administered to the patient as a single dose for imaging 
purposes there is negligible risk of immediate or long-term renal toxicity.  
Available clinical safety data do not show renal events attributable to gallium 
(68Ga) gozetotide.  
Therefore, the risk of renal toxicity is not important and does not require further 
investigation or mitigation. 
Salivary glands have been shown as a site of PSMA uptake. 
Dry mouth is a very common AE as reported in the pivotal VISION study, but 
these events are mild and reversible, may not always be attributed to gallium 
(68Ga) gozetotide, and can be readily managed by symptomatic care. 
The risk of salivary gland toxicity is not important and does not require further 
investigation or mitigation. 
The use of radioactive products implies a risk of exposing healthcare 
professionals preparing and administering the product.  
However, given the low radioactive dose (1.8-2.2 MBq/kg of body weight) 
together with the short physical half-life of the radionuclide gallium-68 (68 min), 
and shorter effective -half-life of 54 minutes administered to the patient as a 
single dose for imaging purposes in specialist centers and the guidance to the 
patients given at these centres, the risk of harmful exposure is considered 
negligible. 
This is not an important risk requiring further characterisation or special 
mitigation measures as patient release procedures implemented by specialist 
centers are considered adequate to address this risk. 
Hypersensitivity reactions can be potentially severe and based on mechanistic 
plausibility there is a theoretical potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions with 
imaging agents including gallium (68Ga) gozetotide. Although a rare 
immunogenic reaction cannot be ruled out, based on current data with a low 
strength of evidence this risk is not considered to be important. 
The medicinal product is administered intravenously and may provoke local 
reactions at the injection site such as pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus.  
There have been reports of local injection site reactions following 
administration, but they are uncommon, mild and reversible, and can be 
readily managed by symptomatic care. 
This is not an important risk requiring further characterisation or special 
mitigation measures.

to treatment agents whose side effects may be clinically impactful. In 
case of false negative image interpretation, the patient may be denied a 
potentially relevant treatment while still expected to receive standards of 
care. As there is no available clinical data concerning this risk and 
considering the impact of interpretation of errors on the patient, this 
needs further characterization. Hence, this is categorized as an important 
potential risk.

Details 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide uptake is not specific to prostate cancer and 
may occur in other types of cancers and non-malignant tissues. 
Distribution of PSMA in the body is not specific to the prostate gland and 
prostate tumor tissue but can be physiologically present in other tissues 
such as lacrimal glands, salivary glands, liver, spleen and bowel, which 
may complicate the interpretation of the images. 
If image acquisition is not performed according to instructions, e.g., 
timing between administration of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide and 
scanning, the images may not present a realistic intensity or distribution 
of PSMA binding which may also complicate the interpretation.

Details 
There is discussion in the literature that PSMA PET images can be 
misinterpreted (e.g., Shetty 2018, Malan 2022), but the evidence that 
this presents a safety risk (see below) to the patient appears tentative. 
The risk consists of false positive or false negative scan interpretations. 
In case of false positive image interpretation, the patients may be 
exposed to treatment agents whose side effects may be clinically 
impactful. In case of false negative image interpretation, the patient may 
be denied a potentially relevant treatment while still expected to receive 
standards of care. 
The risk of misinterpretation and thus the risk of misdiagnosis may vary 
according to stage of prostate cancer in the patient being scanned, as 
there is known to be disease-stage variability of PSMA expression as 
well as inter-patient variability.  
The literature discusses variation in PSMA uptake and potential pitfalls 
in interpretation. Shetty et al 2018 categorise cases based on 
physiological update, benign pathological uptake, non-prostatic 
neoplastic uptake and miscellaneous uptake. 
In the PSMA-617-01 study, in which gallium (68Ga) gozetotide was used 
to select mCRPC patients for treatment with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan there were no such events of misinterpretation reported. 
Patients with other types of cancers or non-malignant processes 
manifesting high PSMA tissue presence.  
Serum PSA levels have been described as affecting the diagnostic 
performance of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide. 
Patient risk factors: low or marginal PSMA-specific tumor burden may 
result in ambiguous images. 
Non-patient risk factors: imaging centers and readers with little 
experience in acquiring and interpreting PSMA PET. 
The risk can be minimized when the PET-tracer is appropriately handled 
and administered by trained health care professionals and when scans 
are interpreted by trained experts in the context of histopathology and/or 
other diagnostic procedures.  
The minimal dose administered should be sufficient and the scan should 
be performed during the recommended time window to allow good quality 
images  (which  can  also  be  influenced  by  the  performance  of  the 
equipment used). 
As  per  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  Interpretation  of  gallium  (68Ga) 
gozetotide  PET  imaging  findings  is  recommended  in  the  context  of 
histopathology and/or other diagnostic procedures. 
Low to moderate impact on the benefit-risk of the product. 
Patient diagnosis depends on more than simply the PSMA PET imaging, 
but the risk of misinterpretation may result in delay of the most 
appropriate treatment or in exposure to the risks of an alternative 
treatment.  
The public health impact is considered low.

scans. The study will be classified as a post-authorization safety study (PASS).  
Primary objective: Assessment of effectiveness of Locametz educational material. 
Secondary  objective:  Impact  of  demographic  data  (e.g.,  educational  background,  years  of 
clinical  practice)  and  training  factors  (e.g.,  training  method,  duration  of  training,  and  user 
baseline training) on knowledge and diagnostic accuracy.   
Study design: 
This post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will consist of a non-interventional cross-sectional 
survey of medical practitioners qualified to interpret PET scans.  
Study population: 
The survey population will consist of medical practitioners qualified to interpret PET scans who 
use Locametz. 
Milestones: Submission of study protocol: 30-Sep-2023. 
Feasibility  of  PASS  study  implementation  will  be  considered  in  selected  EU  countries, 
including but not limited to Germany, where the product is first expected to reach the EU market 
and  is  one  of  the  largest  EU  territories  where  Locametz  is  expected  to  be  prescribed. 
Consideration  of  additional  EU  countries  will  focus  on  the  representativeness  of  the  EU 
populations where Locametz will be most used, the number of medical practitioners who are 
qualified to interpret PET scans in each country, and the timing of launch of Locametz in the 
countries.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for 
LOCAMETZ (gallium (68Ga) gozetotide) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  RMP  for  LOCAMETZ.  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of 
LOCAMETZ, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about LOCAMETZ's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
LOCAMETZ's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how LOCAMETZ should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for LOCAMETZ should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
LOCAMETZ's RMP. 
13.1 
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Locametz,  after  radiolabelling  with  gallium-68,  is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  prostate-
specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) 
in adults with prostate cancer (PCa) in the following clinical settings:  
• Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy,
• Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) after primary curative therapy,
•
Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive metastatic castration
resistant PCa for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is indicated
LOCAMETZ  is  a  multidose  kit  for  radiopharmaceutical  preparation  of  gallium  (68Ga) 
gozetotide solution for injection, containing one vial of white lyophilized powder (powder for 
solution for injection). LOCAMETZ is for radiolabeling with gallium-68 chloride solution. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  LOCAMETZ’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
LOCAMETZ’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage. 
13.2 
Part VI: II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important  risks  of  LOCAMETZ,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about LOCAMETZ's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
•
Novartis 
EU Safety Risk Management Plan version 1.3 
Page 36 of 51 
AAA517 /gozetotide] 
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of LOCAMETZ, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
13.2.1  Part VI – II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  LOCAMETZ’s  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further  investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely 
administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of LOCAMETZ. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Brief description of the product
Chemical class: Recombinant human IgG1κ mAb
Summary of mode of action:
Beyfortus is a recombinant neutralising human IgG1ĸ long-
acting monoclonal antibody to the prefusion conformation of the 
RSV F protein which has been modified with a triple amino acid 
substitution (YTE) in the Fc region to extend serum half-life. 
Nirsevimab binds to a highly conserved epitope in antigenic site 
Ø on the prefusion protein with dissociation constants KD = 0.12 
nM and KD = 1.22 nM for RSV subtype A and B strains, 
respectively. Nirsevimab inhibits the essential membrane fusion 
step in the viral entry process, neutralising the virus and blocking 
cell-to-cell fusion
Important information about its composition:
The antibody has been engineered with a triple amino acid 
substitution, M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) in the Fc region to 
prolong the terminal half-life, which is expected to provide 
protection from RSV disease for the duration of the RSV season 
with a single dose/administration.
Beyfortus® (see Module 1.3.1)
Beyfortus is indicated for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial 
Virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and 
infants during their first RSV season. Beyfortus should be used in 
accordance with official recommendations.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
MODULE SI:  EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) 
AND TARGET POPULATION
II.1.1
Prevention of RSV
Incidence
Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of LRTI among infants and young 
children, resulting in largely predictable annual epidemics worldwide (Jain et al 2015 PERCH 
2019, Shi et at 2017). In temperate climates, RSV infections have occurred primarily during 
the autumn, winter, and spring, with a typical season lasting 5 months. However, RSV activity 
declined during the 2020/2021 season due to COVID-19 mitigation measures that also 
impacted RSV circulation. As these restrictions lift, RSV infections are being observed with 
onset outside the traditional season, and it is expected that the upcoming RSV season may be 
broader and more severe than in previous years, particularly as the susceptible population will 
include infants and children who did not have the typical level of exposure during the 
COVID-19 restrictions (CDC 2021a, CDC 2021b, ECDC 2021, Ujiie et al 2021, van 
Summeren et al 2021).
Respiratory syncytial virus is the major cause of hospital admission, with an estimated 
33 million clinical cases and 3.2 million hospitalisations in children less than 5 years of age in 
2015 (Shi et at 2017).
8 of 33
EU RMP
Nirsevimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
In European countries, the hospitalisation rates were highest for infants within the first year of 
life, 19 to 22 per 1000 children (Jansen et al 2007, van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al 2005, Weigl 
et al 2001). In England, the highest number of confirmed RSV cases were in children aged 
< 1 year, which accounted for 46% (1331/2903) of total lower-level care admissions for RSV 
and 64% (96/150) of intensive care unit/health-dependency unit admissions for RSV (PHE 
2021). During 2010 through 2018 seasons, on average 45225 RSV-associated hospitalisations 
(range: 43715 to 54616) per season was reported in France, 69% among children < 1 year old. 
This represents 28% of all-cause hospitalisations that occurred among children < 1 year old 
(Demont et al 2021). Modelling suggests that each year in England, an estimated 352570 
acute respiratory general practitioner consultations (12 per 100 population), 26400 hospital 
admissions (0.9 per 100 population), and 25 deaths in hospital are attributable to RSV in 
children under 5 years of age (Cromer et al 2017). In addition, RSV hospitalisation rates 
among German children 0 to 3 years of age were found to be 4 and 9 times greater, 
respectively, than the hospitalisation rates associated with parainfluenza and influenza viral 
infections (König et al 2004).
Prevalence:
All infants, including healthy infants born at term, are at risk for severe RSV LRTI with 
primary RSV infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus LRTI is the most common 
reason for admission to hospital in infants < 1 year of age (Hall 2001, Hall 2012, Murray et al 
2014, Rha et al 2020). The majority of infants admitted to hospital with RSV LRTI are 
healthy, were born at term, and have no known predisposing risk factors, as illustrated with 
data from England in Murray et al 2014. This observation is further supported by data series 
from Europe and North America (Bont 2016, Hall 2012, Murray et al 2014, Rha et al 2020).
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Respiratory syncytial virus LRTI, clinically characterised as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, 
represents a serious illness with acute and perhaps long-term consequences to the developing 
lung and immune system in young children (Wu et al 2008; Blanken et al 2013; Lopez Bernal 
et al 2013; Escobar et al 2013). Respiratory syncytial virus is estimated to cause between 60% 
to 80% of childhood bronchiolitis in infants less than 12 months of age (Oymar et al 2014) 
and up to 40% of paediatric pneumonias (Hall 2001).
Specific risk factors have been evaluated and are associated with severe RSV infection, such 
as young age, preterm birth ≤ 35 weeks’ gestational age, CLD (eg, bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, cystic fibrosis), haemodynamically significant CHD, immunodeficiencies, 
neuromuscular disorders, Down syndrome, birth at the start of or during the RSV season. 
However due to the complex interaction of multiple risk factors (eg, demographic, 
physiological, environmental), the risk of severe RSV disease is unpredictable.

The main existing treatment options:
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
There is no preventive option for RSV for all infants. The only current option available for 
prevention is an IgG (palivizumab [Synagis]), requiring monthly injections throughout the 
RSV season, that was licensed in 1998 in the US and since 1999 in EU for infants who are at 
higher risk for serious RSV sequelae.
There is no specific cure for RSV disease and treatment is generally limited to symptomatic 
relief (CDC 2021a) Current treatment of serious RSV illness depends on supportive care to 
ensure adequate hydration and nutrition, with additional oxygen and positive pressure 
mechanical ventilation as required (Ralston et al 2014). Infants with RSV infection who 
develop a mild, self-limited illness can usually be treated in outpatient settings with supportive 
care (Peidimonte and Perez 2015).
An antiviral agent, ribavirin, is licensed for the treatment of RSV infection in the United 
States and some EU member states; however, it is not recommended in the United States or 
EU guidelines due to its high cost, drug toxicities, and the lack of reproducible data on 
efficacy/clinical benefit (Villafana 2017, Barr et al 2019, Hoover 2018).
Natural history of the indicated condition in the <untreated> population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Respiratory syncytial virus usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most infants recover in 1 
to 2 weeks, but RSV infection can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV 
LRTI presenting as bronchiolitis and pneumonia is a more serious disease and may have long-
term consequences.
Although hospitalisation is an important consequence of RSV illness, a large percentage of the 
healthcare burden from RSV occurs outside the hospital (Carroll et al 2008, Hall 2009, Hall 
2012, Oymar et al 2014, Paramore et al 2010, Lively 2019), such that office visits and 
emergency department visits are more frequent than subsequent hospitalisations, especially in 
healthy term and preterm infants. Respiratory syncytial virus infection could be also 
associated with both short-term complications in the first year of life and medium- and long-
term complications in later life, which result in repeated healthcare visits and contribute to the 
substantial clinical and economic burden associated with RSV infection. RSV is the principal 
cause of viral AOM in children, with an estimated 58% of children aged < 3 years in a Finnish 
cohort (N = 2231) developing AOM as a short-term RSV-related complication.
Important co-morbidities: 
Although the target population for nirsevimab is all infants, certain groups, including 
premature infants and those with CLD/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and CHD, are at higher 
risk for severe RSV disease (Figueras-Aloy et al 2016, Paes et al 2016, Checchia et al 2017). 
Evidence also suggests that children immunocompromised through the administration of

Version: 1
anticancer chemotherapy and especially those being transplanted and those with Down 
syndrome face an increased risk of severe RSV LRTI (Murray et al 2014, Robinson et al 
2015, Hutspardol et al 2015, Kristensen et al 2012, Wilkesmann et al 2007).

MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
II.2.1
Summary of key findings from non-clinical data
Key findings from nonclinical studies and their relevance to human usage are described 
below. There were no key safety findings in any of the nonclinical studies conducted 
summarised below:
Toxicity
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies
No significant findings were observed from a repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys (up to 300 mg/kg intravenous or 300 mg IM dose levels which were considered the 
no-observed-adverse-effect-level).
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), no studies were conducted and no studies are planned to 
evaluate the effects of nirsevimab on fertility or embryo-foetal and pre/postnatal development 
because nirsevimab binds a viral-specific target that is not expressed in nonclinical models or 
in humans, and the intended clinical population (infants and children) does not include women 
of childbearing potential. In addition, nirsevimab did not show any adverse effects on 
reproductive tissues in the repeat-dose toxicity study (1468-038) and did not bind to any 
evaluated human reproductive tissues (including placenta) in the tissue cross-reactivity study 
(20046491).
Genotoxicity
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), no genotoxicity testing has been conducted and none is 
planned because it is not applicable to biotechnology-derived large protein products. 
Nirsevimab, is a large protein molecule, and is not expected to cross the nuclear or 
mitochondrial membranes to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal materials.
Carcinogenicity
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), no carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with 
nirsevimab and none are planned given that the target for this product is a virus-specific 
target, which is not expressed in nonclinical animal models or in humans. Further, the 
intended clinical administration is not of a chronic nature.

Safety pharmacology
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
No standalone studies to assess safety pharmacology were conducted. Safety pharmacology of 
nirsevimab was assessed as a component of the repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus
monkeys. No significant findings were observed.
Other toxicity-related information or data
Results from tissue cross-reactivity studies against panels of human tissues, including 
juvenile, neonatal and foetal tissues, showed no staining of any human tissues, as expected. 
There were no safety concerns identified on the basis of nonclinical safety data, and no further 
nonclinical studies were considered necessary.

MODULE SIV:  POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS
Exclusion Criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme
Any history of LRTI or active LRTI prior to, or at the time of, randomisation
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the efficacy and ensure interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile for nirsevimab in 
subjects with a history of LRTI or active LRTI is different than that of the general target 
population.
Known history of RSV infection or active RSV infection prior to, or at the time of, 
randomisation
Reason for exclusion: Infants with known history of RSV infection or active RSV infection 
were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete understanding of the safety and 
efficacy profile and to ensure interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
14 of 33
EU RMP
Nirsevimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile for nirsevimab in 
subjects with a history of RSV infection or active RSV infection prior to, or at time of, 
randomisation will be different than that of the general target population.
Chronic seizures or evolving or unstable neurologic disorder
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety profile and to ensure interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile for nirsevimab in 
subjects with a history of chronic seizures or evolving or unstable neurologic disorder will be 
different than that of the general target population.
Known hepatic dysfunction including known or suspected active or chronic hepatitis 
infection
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to ensure the study safety results were not 
confounded by pre-existing illnesses.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: IgG mAbs are not primarily cleared via the hepatic pathway, thus change in hepatic 
function is not expected to influence nirsevimab clearance.
Immunocompromised patients
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and efficacy profile.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile of nirsevimab is 
different in immunocompromised patients. Findings from a Japanese study which evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of palivizumab in high-risk infants including immunocompromised 
patients indicated a similar safety profile (Haerskjold et al 2017). There is an ongoing global 
nirsevimab study (D5290C00008) evaluating immunocompromised children with different 
underlying causes from different countries to support safety evaluation in a diverse 
population.
Receipt of palivizumab or other RSV mAb or any RSV vaccine, including maternal RSV 
vaccination
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and efficacy data of nirsevimab and ensure interpretability of data.
15 of 33
EU RMP
Nirsevimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: For patients who receive any RSV vaccine, including infants whose mothers 
received an RSV vaccine (ie, maternal RSV vaccines), there is no scientific rationale to 
suspect that the safety profile of nirsevimab may differ to that characterised so far for the 
general target population.
Known renal impairment
Reason for exclusion: Infants were excluded to ensure the study safety results were not 
confounded by pre-existing illnesses.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: IgG mAbs are not primarily cleared via the renal pathway, thus change in renal 
function is not expected to influence nirsevimab clearance. For this reason, it is not anticipated 
that the safety profile will be different in patients with active or chronic renal impairment 
compared to that characterised so far in the general target population.
Clinically significant congenital anomaly of the respiratory tract
Reason for exclusion: Infants with clinically significant congenital anomaly of the respiratory 
tract were excluded to ensure the study results, specifically respiratory findings, were not 
confounded by pre-existing illnesses.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile in this population is 
different to that of the general target population. Further characterisation of this population is 
neither feasible nor warranted.
History of allergy to component of mAb
Reason for exclusion:   Infants with a history of allergy to any component of a mAb were 
excluded as they may be at a higher risk of hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction).
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Nirsevimab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to active 
substance or excipients; therefore, this population is not relevant as missing information.
Mother with HIV infection (unless the child has been proven to be not infected)

order to avoid factors that may confound a complete understanding of the safety and efficacy 
data of nirsevimab and ensure interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: There is no scientific rationale to suspect that the safety profile of nirsevimab is 
different in immunocompromised patients including those with HIV. There is an ongoing 
global nirsevimab study evaluating the immunocompromised children with different 
underlying causes (including HIV infection) from different countries to support safety 
evaluation in a diverse population (D5290C00008).

Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission
II.7.1.1
Risk not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP
Reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile

Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions have been observed with administration
of nirsevimab. There were no serious events related to nirsevimab injection. The reported 
terms were injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site oedema, injection 
site reaction, injection site erythema. The majority of events were mild to moderate in 
intensity and were transient and resolved within 1 or 2 days. These reactions are managed 
according to standard clinical practice and do not impact the benefit-risk profile of 
nirsevimab.
 Rash: Events of rash have been observed with the administration of nirsevimab. There 
were no serious events of rash that were considered to be related to nirsevimab. The 
following events with reported terms rash, rash macular, and rash maculo-papular were 
assessed as related to nirsevimab administration. These events were mild or moderate in 
intensity. These reactions are managed according to standard clinical practice and do not 
impact the benefit-risk profile of nirsevimab. 

Pyrexia: Events of pyrexia have been observed with the administration of nirsevimab. 
There have been no serious events of pyrexia considered to be related to nirsevimab

administration. These reactions are managed according to standard clinical practice and 
do not impact the benefit-risk profile of nirsevimab.
Potential risks that require no further characterization. 

Immediate (Type 1) hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: Monoclonal 
antibodies have the potential to cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions including 
anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset with 
multi-organ system involvement that can present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe 
life-threatening reaction requiring immediate medical attention. Manifestations of 
anaphylaxis include involvement of skin, mucosal tissue or both (eg, generalised urticaria, 
pruritus or flushing, angioedema), respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnoea, wheeze-
bronchospasm, stridor, hypoxemia), hypotension or associated symptoms of end-organ 
dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence), and gastrointestinal 
symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting). There have been no serious adverse 
events of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis attributable to nirsevimab 
reported in the clinical development programme.
Healthcare professionals are familiar with this risk and the management of this risk is 
integrated into routine medical practice when administering protein-based infusion/injection 
therapies. Therefore, the risk of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis is considered to be a 
potential risk not categorised as important for inclusion in the RMP. These reactions are 
managed as per routine clinical practice and guidance to healthcare professionals provided in 
the product information (Section 4.4).
Potential risks also not considered important

Immune complex disease (Type III hypersensitivity): Nirsevimab, like other biologics, 
can induce the development of ADA and the occurrence of such ADA could result in 
immune complex disease or altered nirsevimab levels or activity. Drug-induced immune 
complex (type III) hypersensitivity reactions can occur when the host immune system 
generates antibodies to drug resulting in soluble circulating antigen-antibody complex 
formation and their deposition in blood vessels. Immune complex disease can manifest in 
the form of a number of conditions such as vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, 
glomerulonephritis, serum sickness, and arthralgias. There were a limited number of 
subjects (n = 110; 5.9%) in the pivotal studies who were ADA positive post baseline. 
Although the numbers were small and data were limited, ADA did not appear to impact 
the safety or overall efficacy of nirsevimab. In addition, there have been no events of
immune complex disease reported in the nirsevimab clinical development programme. 
This risk is not considered to alter the risk-benefit profile of nirsevimab. Therefore, the 
risk of immune complex disease is considered to be a potential risk not categorised as 
important for inclusion in the RMP.

 Thrombocytopaenia: Although severe thrombocytopaenia cases have been reported in 
post-approval use of Synagis and are included in the product information, similar events 
have not been observed with nirsevimab. The possible clinical outcomes of 
thrombocytopaenia  include bleeding in the mouth and gums, bruising, nosebleeds, 
petechiae (pinpoint red spots/rash), the majority of these outcomes were they to occur 
would not impact benefit risk with the possible exception of severe bleeding  Nonserious 
cases of thrombocytopaenia were observed rarely in the nirsevimab clinical trials but all 
cases included other confounding factors. There were no investigational product-related 
serious events of thrombocytopaenia reported in the nirsevimab clinical development 
programme. For these reasons, thrombocytopaenia is not considered to impact the benefit 
risk profile of Nirsevimab and routine pharmacovigilance activities and guidance in 
Section 4.4 of the product information are considered sufficient to manage these events. A 
follow-up safety questionnaire for thrombocytopaenia events will be implemented to 
characterize this adverse event of special interest (AESI) which will continue to be 
closely monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance activities. There are no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimization measures in place and the 
potential risk of thrombocytopaenia events is not considered important for the inclusion 
in the RMP.
 Antibody-dependent enhancement of disease: ADE is a theoretical risk for mAbs. One 
of the syndromes of ADE involves increased binding efficiency of virus-antibody 
complexes to Fc receptor bearing cells which trigger virus entry. Potential clinical 
outcomes resulting from ADE include lack of therapeutic effect progressing to 
unanticipated worsening of RSV, which has not been observed in the clinical trials to 
date. The potential for ADE of RSV infection was evaluated in a cotton rat model of RSV 
infection using 1G7, the non-YTE version of nirsevimab. No evidence of enhancement of 
RSV infection was observed at any dose evaluated, including sub-efficacious doses down 
to 0.125 mg/kg. For these reasons ADE is not considered to impact the benefit-risk profile 
of nirsevimab and is therefore not considered to be an important potential risk.
 Antiviral resistance: Currently nirsevimab has demonstrated neutralisation activity 
against both RSV A and RSV B strains through 150 days post dose and the percentage of 
subjects with any RSV LRTI or non-LRTI event that had an RSV isolate containing 
resistance-associated substitutions was rare across all treatment groups and reporting 
periods in the 3 pivotal studies. Potential emergence of neutralisation escape variants that 
may impact effectiveness of nirsevimab will continue to be monitored closely and 
characterised through ongoing virologic assessment in RSV molecular surveillance 
studies (OUTSMART-RSV, INFORM-RSV, and SEARCH-RSV) and post-marketing 
RSV molecular surveillance activities.

ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
AstraZeneca undertakes routine pharmacovigilance activities consistent with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2E Pharmacovigilance Planning Guideline. Routine 
pharmacovigilance activities (as defined by standard operating procedures and guidelines) are 
designed to rapidly assess the ongoing safety profile of Nirsevimab throughout clinical 
development and in the post-authorization period in order to characterize and communicate 
pertinent safety data appropriately. A comprehensive description of all aspects of the 
pharmacovigilance system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File, which is 
available upon request.
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires:
There are no follow-up questionnaires for safety concerns for Nirsevimab. However, there are 
follow-up questionnaires in place for thrombocytopaenia (refer to Section SVII.1.1).  
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities:
Continuous and thorough reviews of thrombocytopaenia as an AESI (refer to Section 
SVII.1.1) will be conducted as part of the close monitoring of this topic. Data from these 
reviews will be summarized in the PSURs.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
FOR BEYFORTUS (NIRSEVIMAB)
This is a summary of the RMP for Beyfortus. The RMP details important risks of Beyfortus, 
how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about the risks 
and uncertainties for Beyfortus (missing information).
25 of 33
EU RMP
Nirsevimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 1
Beyfortus’s Summary of Product Characteristics SmPC and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and caregivers for infants on how Beyfortus should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for Beyfortus should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report EPAR.
VI.1
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Beyfortus is indicated for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates 
and infants during their first RSV season (see SmPC for the full indication). Beyfortus
contains nirsevimab as the active substance and it is given by IM administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Beyfortus’s benefits can be found in Beyfortus’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage (<< link to the EPAR summary landing page to be 
added when available>>).
VI.2
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS
Important risks of Beyfortus, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Beyfortus 's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to caregiver for infants and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Beyfortus is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
VI.2.1
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Beyfortus are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered 
(Table VI-1). Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Beyfortus. Potential risks 
are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

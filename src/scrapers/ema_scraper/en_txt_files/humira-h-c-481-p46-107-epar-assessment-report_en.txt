1.  Introduction 
The MAH stated that the purpose of this submission is to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended, by submitting data available from patients less than 18 years of age 
recruited to the study P11-973: 
Long-term Documentation of the Safety, Effectiveness, and Effects on Quality of Life and Work 
Productivity in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis during HUMIRA® (Adalimumab) Therapy in Routine 
Clinical Practice (AGIL) and Supplementary Documentation to Record Cardiovascular and Metabolic 
Risk Factors (AGIL-CV) 
Approximately, 7200 patients were enrolled into this study. A total of 3 paediatric patients were 
included in the study. According to the MAH, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk 
balance and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation. 
The submission was dated 27 April 2018. The submission included study report/ study results final for 
P11-973 and a short critical expert overview. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The primary goal of study P11-973 was to document the impact of adalimumab treatment on work-
related and therapeutic outcomes during a 5-year non-interventional study of adult German patients 
with RA. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Adalimumab (HUMIRA®): 40 mg subcutan (s.c.) every other week 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: P11-973. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study P11-973:  
Description 
The study P11-973 was a prospective, multicenter, observational, non-interventional study 
(Clinicaltrials.gov trial registration NCT01076205, also referred to as GER0805 and AGIL). 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were, according to the study report, to the determine the impact 
of adalimumab on employment related outcomes and obtain long-term documentation of the 
effectiveness and safety of adalimumab treatment as used in daily clinical practice in Germany to treat

adult patients with RA over a time interval of 60 months. An amendment to the study allowed the 
collection of additional data concerning CV risk factors, including laboratory blood chemistry variables 
Study design 
Data for the study were collected on a Case Report Form (CRF). The observation period for each 
individual patient began with the administration of the initial dose of adalimumab (Month 0) and lasted 
for a maximum of 60 months. Therapy follow-ups were recommended at Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, 
and then yearly. Patients for the AGIL study were enrolled by clinicians at 326 different clinical sites 
throughout Germany. The first patient was seen on 12 January 2009 and the last visit occurred on 14 
September 2017. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population for AGIL was a community non-probability (non-random) sample of patients with 
RA who resided in Germany and was preparing to initiate adalimumab therapy at the decision of the 
clinician. German regulations state that all patients are eligible for non-interventional studies as long 
as they are able to give consent and understand the language of the patient questionnaires; there are 
no exclusions. Doctors were instructed to enrol patients with moderate to severely active RA who had 
failed other anti-rheumatic drugs and patients with severe, active and progressive RA regardless of 
previous treatment; inclusion and exclusion criteria adhered with the European Medical Agencies 
Summary of Product Characteristics. Doctors were also instructed to limit enrolment to adult 
patients (≥ 18 years of age) with RA. However, there was no means of preventing doctors 
from enrolling patients with other indications or patients younger than 18 years of age. All 
patients were required to provide informed consent. 
Treatments 
Adalimumab (HUMIRA®): 40 mg subcutan (s.c.) every other week 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Key effectiveness variables included self-reported missed work days, WAI, WPAI, joint counts, 
laboratory inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), DAS28, HAQ-DI, and EQ-5D, EQ-VAS. For safety 
evaluations, patients were asked about AEs at each visit; information on AEs was collected on an AE 
reporting form. Collected AEs were listed in the study report by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT). Clinicians were also asked to list possible causality with treatment. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed and Baseline data  
Four patient cohorts were evaluated in this study: employed patients (patients who were employed 
full- or part-time at baseline) (N = 3285), full analysis set (FAS; patients with sufficient data for 
effectiveness analyses) (N = 4466), safety set (all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of 
adalimumab) (N = 7229), and the AGIL-CV substudy cohort (patients enrolled in AGIL-CV) (N = 260). 
At Month 60, patient cohorts contained fewer than 20% of the baseline population; 1210 patients 
(16.7%) were ongoing in the safety set and 726 (16.3%) in the FAS. Approximately 40% of patients 
were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. The remainder of the patients (approximately 60%) 
withdrew from the study. Among patients who withdrew, lack of effectiveness was the most frequent 
reasons for study withdrawal (22.5% of patients in the FAS and 19.7% of patients in the safety set).

Adverse events accounted for fewer than 5% of study discontinuations (4.2% in the FAS and 3.8% in 
the safety set). 
Three patients in the safety set (0.04%) were < 18 years of age. One of the pediatric patients was 
included in the FAS; the other two were excluded from the FAS due to lack of baseline DAS28 data (n 
= 1) and DAS28 < 3.2 at baseline (n = 1). There were no pediatric patients in the employed patient 
cohort or AGIL-CV.  The three pediatric patients were included as a deviation from the study protocol. 
Their demographic information and study disposition data are summarized in the table below.

Efficacy results 
According to the applicant, the findings of this observational study overall support the conclusion that 
long-term treatment with adalimumab has a favorable impact on employment-related outcomes in 
adult patients with RA.  
Regarding the three pediatric patients, the applicant states that both of the two patients with baseline 
DAS28 data (Patients 1 and 3 in the Table above) showed improvements in DAS28 during therapy. All 
three patients showed improvements (decreases) in pain and patient global assessment (PGA) scores 
between Baseline and Month 3. For Patient 3, pain and PGA increased from Month 3 to Month 6, but 
remained below baseline. For Patients 1 and 2, pain and PGA also increased at visits after Month 3 and 
in some cases exceeded baseline scores. 
Safety results 
The duration of adalimumab exposure in the safety set (N = 7229) was 2.06 ± 1.77 years. In the 
safety set, 32.1% of patients experienced an AE during the 60-month study and 12.9% experienced a 
serious AE (SAE). The most common non-serious AE by SOC was infections and infestations (14.8%). 
Twenty-three deaths occurred during the study, a review of AEs and deaths did, according to the 
applicant, not reveal any patterns of concern. 
Regarding the three pediatric patients, Patient 3 (see table above) did not report any adverse events. 
Patient 1 was diagnosed with iritis approximately 18 months after initiation of adalimumab, and this 
disorder lasted 23 days. Causality with respect to adalimumab was not given; infection was listed 
under "other causality." Patient 2 underwent arthroscopy of the right knee approximately 8 months 
after initiation of adalimumab. Assessment of adalimumab causality was not provided. Neither AE was 
considered serious. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant concludes that the small number of pediatric patients enrolled in study P11-973 limits 
interpretation, but that adalimumab showed some signs of effectiveness in adolescents with RA and did 
not result in any new safety signals.

The Rapporteur considers that the data that can be extracted from the three pedatric subjects 
(adolescents aged 15-16 years) that were accidentally included in study P11-973 are highly limited but 
it is agreed with the applicant that no data that changes the B/R balance of the product or warrants 
changes to the PI or RMP has been retrieved. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The data that can be extracted from the three pedatric subjects (adolescents aged 15-16 years) that 
were erroneously included in the observational, non-interventional study P11-973 are very limited. 
However, it is agreed with the applicant that no data that changes the B/R balance of the product or 
warrants changes to the PI or RMP has been retrieved. No further actions are required. 
Requirements are considered 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

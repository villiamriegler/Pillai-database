SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
CABOMETYX (CABOZANTINIB) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Cabometyx.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Cabometyx, how these risks can be minimised and how more information 
will be obtained about Cabometyx's risks. 
Cabometyx's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Cabometyx should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Cabometyx should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Cabometyx's RMP. 
The Medicine and What it is Used for 
I 
Cabometyx is authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC)  as  first  line  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  intermediate  or  poor  risk  and  in  adults 
following  prior  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)-targeted  therapy.  Cabometyx,  in 
combination  with  nivolumab,  is  authorised  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced  RCC  in 
adults.  Cabometyx  is  authorised  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have previously been treated  with sorafenib. Cabomeytx is 
authorised  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  differentiated  thyroid  carcinoma  (DTC),  refractory  or  not  eligible  to  radioactive 
iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy (see SmPC for the 
full  indication).  It  contains  cabozantinib  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by  oral 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Cabometyx’s benefits can be found in 
Cabometyx’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicine’s Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Cabometyx  
II   Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important  risks  of  Cabometyx,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Cabometyx's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and  regularly  analysed  including  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that 
 
immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Cabometyx are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cabometyx. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data  but  this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk – Gastrointestinal perforation 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation was identified from 
cabozantinib clinical studies. Additional data confirming the risk were 
from postmarketing use of cabozantinib. GI perforation has been 
reported in Studies XL184-308, A031203, CA2099ER, XL184-309 and 
XL184-311, and GI perforation was also seen in published studies with 
other similar medicines (VEGF-TKIs) in patients with RCC and 
advanced HCC. Gastrointestinal perforation can have debilitating, 
disabling, or fatal outcomes and therefore is an important identified 
risk for cabozantinib. 
Patients who have inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn’s disease, 
ulcerative colitis, carcinomatosis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis), gastric 
ulcer, intestinal obstruction, have tumour infiltration of the GI viscera, 
or have complications from previous GI surgery (particularly when 
associated with delayed or incomplete healing) are potentially at 
higher risk of developing a perforation (hole in the GI tract). Additional 
risk factors include use of steroid treatment or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs at the same time and previous use of 
radiotherapy.

Important identified risk - Gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal fistula 
The risk of fistula was identified from cabozantinib clinical studies. 
Evidence for 
Additional data confirming the risk were from postmarketing use of 
linking the 
cabozantinib. Fistula was reported in Studies XL184 308, A031203, 
risk to the 
CA2099ER, XL184 309, and XL184-311 confirmed by a low frequency 
medicine 
of fistula seen in published studies of other VEGF TKIs in metastatic 
RCC and advanced HCC. Fistula can have a debilitating, disabling or 
fatal outcome and therefore is an important identified risk for 
cabozantinib. 
Risk factors for GI fistula (a connection between the digestive system 
and adjacent organs) are the same as for GI perforations noted above. 
In addition, radiation therapy may lead to fistula formation. Patients 
with complications from previous GI surgery (particularly when 
associated with delayed or incomplete healing) are potentially at 
higher risk of developing fistulae. 
Risk factors for non GI fistulae include infiltration of viscera by tumour 
(spread of tumour into the abdomen), radiation therapy and 
incomplete healing after surgery.

Important identified risk – Thromboembolic events 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of thromboembolic events was identified from cabozantinib 
clinical studies. Additional data confirming the risk were from 
postmarketing use of cabozantinib. Thromboembolic events can be 
arterial (ATE) or venous (VTE) or mixed. ATEs was reported in Studies 
XL184 308, A031203, CA2099ER, XL184-309 and XL184-311. Events 
of venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic events were more 
frequently reported compared with ATEs in patients treated with 
cabozantinib in these studies. In the literature there was no increase in

the risk of VTEs for VEGF TKIs compared with controls in the overall 
population and no increase in the risk of VTEs was found among 
different VEGF TKIs or tumour types. Although the incidence of these 
events is generally low, they can have debilitating, disabling or fatal 
outcomes and therefore thromboembolic events is an important 
identified risk for cabozantinib. 
Cancer patients are at high risk for VTE (blood clots in the vein). The 
development of VTE in cancer patients appears to have many causes, 
including tumour stage at the time of diagnosis, tumour type and site, 
anticancer therapy and surgery. The risk of thrombosis is related to 
endothelial injury (damage to the vessel wall), stasis (slowing down of 
blood flow), and alterations in blood coagulability (likelihood of 
clotting) (inherited or acquired). Patients with HCC and macrovascular 
(large blood vessels) invasion are potentially at higher risk of venous 
and mixed thrombotic events. Most patients with VTE have one or 
more risk factors. Patients with a history of VTE are more likely to 
experience additional episodes, particularly if they are exposed to high 
risk situations. Increased levels of coagulation molecules, concurrent 
disease (such as endocarditis), use of growth factors and cytotoxic 
chemotherapy may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis (blood clot 
in the artery).

Important identified risk – Haemorrhage (Grade ≥3) 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of haemorrhage (Grade ≥3) was identified from cabozantinib 
clinical studies. Additional data confirming the risk were from 
postmarketing use of cabozantinib. Haemorrhage (of Grade ≥3 
severity) was reported in Studies XL184 308, A031203, CA2099ER, 
XL184-309 and XL184-311.  
A similar risk was observed with other cancer medicines where the 
frequency of bleeding events in cancer patients treated with sorafenib 
or sunitinib was significantly higher compared to placebo. In another 
study in patients with advanced RCC, Grade 3 haemorrhage was 
reported in patients treated with sorafenib but no Grade 4 adverse 
reactions were observed. In a study in patients with HCC that was not 
capable of being removed surgically, Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions 
of haemorrhage were reported in patients treated with sorafenib. In 
other noncontrolled studies with VEGF inhibitors a higher frequency of 
≥Grade 3 haemorrhage was seen in patients with HCC.  
These events can have debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes and 
haemorrhage (≥Grade 3) is therefore an important identified risk for 
cabozantinib. 
Tissues with tumour involvement may potentially be associated with 
more frequent haemorrhage than areas without tumours, especially if 
there is encroachment of (advancing towards) blood vessels. 
The potential factors that could be associated with an increased risk of 
respiratory tract haemorrhage include patients who experience 
haemoptysis (coughing blood) before treatment. Gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage could be caused by some medicines including 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or corticosteroids. 
Treatment of thrombotic events with medicines to help prevent clots 
can also result in haemorrhage.

Important identified risk – Wound complications 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of wound complications was identified from cabozantinib 
clinical studies. Additional data confirming the risk were from 
postmarketing use of cabozantinib. Wound complications were 
reported in Studies XL184-308, CA2099ER, XL184-309, and XL184-
311, confirmed by wound complications were seen in two published 
studies of other VEGF-TKIs in metastatic RCC and HCC. Wound 
complications can have debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes, and 
wound complications is therefore an important identified risk for 
cabozantinib. 
 
Important identified risk – Wound complications 
Risk factors 
and risk 
groups 
Patients with wounds from accidents or surgery are at risk of wound 
complications. Significant risk factors include age over 65 years, 
wound infection, malignancy, obesity, pulmonary (lung) disease, 
haemodynamic instability (not enough pressure to keep blood flowing 
to other parts of the body), ascites (build-up of fluid in the abdomen), 
uraemia (blood in the urea), diabetes, and hypertension (high blood 
pressure).

Important identified risk – Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy syndrome 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of PRES (a neurologic condition with fits, headaches, 
confusion, or finding it difficult to concentrate) was identified from 
cabozantinib clinical studies using the cabozantinib capsule but not in 
Studies XL184-308, A031203, CA2099ER or XL184-309 using the 
cabozantinib tablet. In Study XL184-311, one case of PRES occurred, 
Additional data confirm the risk were from postmarketing use of 
cabozantinib. Although PRES is an infrequent syndrome, these events 
can have debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes and PRES is 
therefore an important identified risk for cabozantinib. 
Risk factors for PRES in general include hypertensive (high blood 
pressure) disorders, renal (kidney) failure and immunosuppressive 
therapies. Hypertension and renal failure are both co-morbidities 
(disorders that often occur at the same time) in RCC patients.

Risk

measures 
The risk of osteonecrosis was identified from cabozantinib clinical 
studies. Additional data confirming the risk were from postmarketing 
use of cabozantinib. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in 
the jaw) was reported in Studies XL184-308, CA2099ER and XL184-
311. ONJ was not seen in Studies A031203 or XL184-309. ONJ can 
have debilitating, disabling or disfiguring outcomes and osteonecrosis 
is therefore an important identified risk for cabozantinib. 
A study showed that treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib and 
bisphosphonates at the same time increases the risk of ONJ in RCC 
patients. Bisphosphonate use is low in RCC patients due to the effect 
on renal function. The use of bisphosphonates or denosumab 
(medicines associated with an increased risk of ONJ) is low in patients 
with RCC due to their known effect on renal function. Additional risk 
factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, 
chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, and 
dental or orofacial (mouth, jaws and face) surgery procedures.

The risk of renal (kidney) failure was identified from cabozantinib

Studies XL184 308, A031203, CA2099ER and XL184-309 and XL184-
311. One patient died of acute renal failure in Study A031203; 
however, this patient had elevated creatinine at screening and died of 
acute renal failure following dehydration and after refusing dialysis. 
Renal failure can be caused by conditions such as dehydration 
secondary to vomiting or diarrhoea, drug toxicity such as from 
contrast agents, hypertension, urinary tract infections, diabetes 
mellitus, and underlying disease of RCC.

Important potential risk - Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of hepatotoxicity was identified from the cabozantinib clinical 
studies. Additional data confirming the risk were from postmarketing 
use of cabozantinib. Elevations of liver enzymes were reported in 
cabozantinib treated patients in Studies XL184 308, A031203, XL184 
309, XL184-311. There were, however, no confirmed cases of drug 
induced liver injury in these studies.  
In Study CA2099ER elevations of liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity 
were reported in patients treated with cabozantinib in combination 
with nivolumab. Four patients had multiple elevations of liver enzymes 
that could indicate a risk of severe or fatal liver injury caused by a 
drug. All 4 patients recovered with the use of corticosteroids. While 
patients treated with cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab have 
an increased risk of hepatotoxicity compared to cabozantinib treatment 
alone, this was found to be manageable with patient monitoring, use 
of corticosteroids as treatment and dose changes of cabozantinib and 
nivolumab. Immune-mediated hepatitis is a recognised side effect of 
nivolumab. 
Hepatotoxic events can have debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes. 
In the published literature, a large study reported elevations in liver 
enzymes in patients treated with VEGF-TKIs medicines compared to 
controls. 
Published clinical studies found an overall increase in the risk of 
developing high-grade (Grade 3 or above) hepatotoxicity with VEGF-
TKI medicines compared to placebo treated patients. This finding was 
confirmed in another study which found an increased frequency of all 
grade elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) in 
patients exposed to VEGF TKIs compared to controls.

Important potential risk -Embryotoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of embryotoxicity was identified based on nonclinical data. No 
cases of pregnancy or pregnancy in partner have been described for 
cabozantinib during postmarketing experience through to 28November 
2020. In nonclinical studies, cabozantinib was embryotoxic and 
produced foetal malformations in rats and foetal soft tissue 
malformations, but no foetal external or skeletal malformations, in 
rabbits.  
A review of the literature on pregnancy and cancer chemotherapy 
found that foetal malformations can occur if the medicine is used 
during the first trimester of pregnancy. Exposure in the second and 
third trimester was associated with a reduced frequency of foetal 
malformations. Similar findings were reported in another review in 
which the majority of reported malformations occurred in patients 
receiving chemotherapy in the first trimester. 
The ‘at risk’ group for experiencing cabozantinib related embryotoxicity 
comprises female patients of childbearing potential or female partners 
of male patients treated with cabozantinib. 
Risk factor in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: 
Treatment with chemotherapy in the first trimester, during 
organogenesis, substantially increases the risk of foetal malformation 
compared to exposure to chemotherapy in the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy.

Important potential risk – Carcinogenicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of carcinogenicity was identified based on nonclinical data. 
Administration of cabozantinib to rats resulted in benign 
pheochromocytoma (a rare tumour of adrenal gland tissue), alone or 
in combination with malignant pheochromocytoma. In the clinical 
studies new second cancers following treatment with cabozantinib was 
very low, which was similar to the Cabometyx postmarketing 
experience. No clinical cases of pheochromocytoma have occurred up 
to 28November 2020. A study found that the risk of developing 
subsequent cancers is about 10% for patients with kidney cancer and 
about 1% for patients with liver cancer. Carcinogenicity is therefore an 
important potential risk for cabozantinib. 
 
Important potential risk – Carcinogenicity 
Risk factors 
and risk 
groups 
Immune deficiency has been linked to increased risk of second 
cancers. Age and initial tumour size can be important risk factors. 
Younger patients, who were less than 30 years of age when they were 
first diagnosed with RCC, were nearly four times more likely than older 
patients to develop a second cancer. Smaller initial tumours (less than 
10 cm) also increase the risk of a second cancer, particularly in the 
kidney and endocrine glands. In addition to cancer treatment, other 
risk factors for multiple primary cancers are patient age, 
environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility.

issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Following a CHMP request, the Marketing

SmPC and PL 
In December 2004, the MAH (Marketing Authorisation 
Authorisation Holder applied for an update of section 
4.2 (Posology and method of administration), section 
4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) 
and section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include safety 
information regarding three suspected adverse drug 
reactions involving skin lesions in children. 
Holder) informed the EMEA and the Rapporteur about three 
cases of serious skin reactions over the elbows resembling 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) in patients treated with 
Cystagon. All of them were observed in Ireland and one was 
fatal. The MAH issued a letter in order to inform the 
concerned specialised physicians about this finding, and 
requesting information on new cases. As a result, an 
additional case from Italy was reported (in this fourth case, 
Page 9/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Package Leaflet (PL) has been amended 
accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
the child was treated with a formulation of cysteamine 
chlorhydrate, not Cystagon, when the adverse reaction 
appeared). 
Following the evaluation of the available information of these 
cases, the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a type II 
variation to reflect the new information. Sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), 
and relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were 
amended in order to include information regarding these 
events.

SmPC, Annex 
The CHMP having reviewed the evidence of compliance with 
II, Labelling 
the specific obligations submitted by the MAH and having 
and PL 
re-assessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal product 
recommended that no amendment of Annexes I and III to 
Commission Decision is necessary. The CHMP agreed to 
revise the specific obligations set out in Annex II.C to the 
Commission Decision. On the basis of the data submitted 
since the Marketing Authorisation, the benefit/risk for 
Cystagon remained positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended the updating of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation for Cystagon and that 
the authorisation should remain under exceptional 
circumstances.

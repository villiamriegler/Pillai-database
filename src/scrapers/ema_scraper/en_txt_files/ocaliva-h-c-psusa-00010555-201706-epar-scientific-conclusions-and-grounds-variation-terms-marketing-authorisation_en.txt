Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for obeticholic acid, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In the post marketing setting, serious liver injury and death have been reported with more frequent 
dosing of obeticholic acid than recommended in patients with moderate to severe decreases in liver 
function. A causal relationship can currently not be excluded. Liver-related adverse events have 
occurred both early in treatment and after months of treatment.  Hepatically impaired PBC patients with 
cirrhosis or elevated bilirubin are most at risk of liver related complications. 
Reinforced differential dosing recommendations for OCALIVA in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) 
patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have been recommended in the product 
information and RMP. A DHPC and a communication plan have been also recommended. The CHMP 
agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for obeticholic acid the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing obeticholic acid is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

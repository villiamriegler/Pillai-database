2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In 2018, the MAH had already sought an extension of indication for the treatment of HA without inhibitors 
(EMEA/H/C/004406/II/02). Taking into account an advice of an ad hoc expert group and considering the 
lack of data and because of the risk of thrombosis in patient with appreciable endogenous FVIII activity 
when exposed to emicizumab and the risk of TMA, the CHMP concluded that no recommendation can be 
made to grant the indication in mild and moderate HA patients without inhibitors.  
With this application, the MAH is now submitting data from HAVEN 6 clinical study which is a multicentre, 
open-label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
emicizumab in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A (HA), which accounts for 80% of all cases of haemophilia, is an X-linked recessive bleeding 
disorder caused by a congenital deficiency of FVIII activity, an essential co-factor for the enzymatic 
reaction in which FIXa activates FX.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
This application seeks to extend the currently approved indication statement for emicizumab to include 
adult and paediatric patients with HA without FVIII inhibitors who have mild or moderate disease for 
whom prophylaxis is clinically indicated.  
Epidemiology  
The prevalence of HA at birth is approximately 24.6 in 100,000 males and it is estimated that 650,000 
people worldwide are living with this condition (WFH 2020). Data on the prevalence of HA (FVIII activity 
<40%) in female carriers are scarce as women with HA have historically been underdiagnosed and 
undertreated. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
In patients with haemophilia, the residual plasma level of clotting factor is considered to be the most 
critical predictor of spontaneous bleeding. It is on this basis that the severity of the HA patients is 
phenotypically classified by the residual endogenous level of FVIII activity into severe (<1%), moderate 
(≥1% and ≤5%) and mild (>5% and <40%) categories. Although classifications based exclusively on 
residual FVIII levels are often proportionally manifested in clinical presentations of types and numbers of 
bleeding episodes, phenotypic heterogeneity exists, some moderate patients (FVIII level ≥1%) may 
exhibit a severe bleeding phenotype and therefore may require regular prophylactic therapy. 
Common clinical signs of HA include easy bruising, prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery, 
spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or soft tissues and intracranial haemorrhage. Joint bleeding is 
a hallmark of HA, repeated hemarthrosis causes inflammation and synovial degeneration leading to 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 9/92 
 
 
 
 
chronic arthropathy, a common and major complication in patients with haemophilia. Patients with non-
severe HA can experience significant and debilitating bleeding, including homophilic arthropathy in 
approximately 30% of patients, which affect patient’s quality of life (QoL). 
Management 
The standard treatment for HA patients with severe bleeding phenotype is FVIII replacement therapy 
either episodic or prophylactic which are the same for patients with moderate and severe disease. 
Prophylactic therapy has been recognised as superior to episodic treatment. However, due to the high 
treatment burden of FVIII prophylaxis, a substantial fraction of patients is only treated episodically (“on 
demand”) in response to the occurrence of bleeding symptoms.  
The FVIII mimetic Hemlibra is currently indicated for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients 
with HA with FVIII inhibitors or severe HA without inhibitors. The key benefits of Hemlibra are its 
subcutaneous route of administration, long half-life, high efficacy in bleed prevention, and reduction of 
the frequency of bleeding episodes. 
In case of non-severe HA without inhibitor, treatment approaches depend significantly on patient’s 
individual bleeding phenotype: 
Desmopressin is approved across Europe for treatment of minor bleeds and to prevent bleedings in 
connection with surgery for patients with mild HA; however, the individual patient response is variable 
and needs to be tested at the start of treatment. Repeated administration may result in tachyphylaxis and 
increased risk of complications, therefore, use for more than 3 consecutive days is not recommended and 
other therapy is required for patients who require routine prophylaxis, such as patients with a more 
severe bleeding phenotype. 
In addition, tranexamic acid (anti-fibrinolytics) is indicated in adults and children in Europe for prevention 
and treatment of haemorrhages due to general or local fibrinolysis. It is useful in treatment of superficial 
soft tissue and mucosal bleed either alone or combined with desmopressin, women and girls with 
haemophilia experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding are also commonly prescribed tranexamic acid.  
Unmet need in patients with moderate and mild HA 
Primary prophylaxis with FVIII is beneficial for patients with non-severe HA without inhibitors who present 
with more severe bleeding patterns and is used by approximately 30% of patients with non-severe HA. 
However, currently available FVIII replacement therapy often requiring IV administration 2 to 4 times a 
week constitutes a high treatment burden for patients which results in partial adoption and adherence to 
prophylaxis. In addition, the need for frequent venous access in turn often requires the use of central 
venous access device and delay initiation of prophylaxis in young children. 
The CHESS (Cost of Haemophilia in Europe: a Socioeconomic Survey) -II and CHESS Paediatrics studies 
are retrospective, burden-of-illness studies in adults and children respectively, with HA without inhibitors 
carried out across European countries. These studies show that the daily life of patients is compromised 
due to their HA, with reduced physical and social activities, fewer opportunities and feelings of frustration.  
A systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to determine the unmet medical need in patients on 
prophylactic treatment (excluding emicizumab) for congenital HA, in a population without inhibitors to 
FVIII, across all age groups and disease severities. This SLR found six observational studies with data on 
bleeding frequency in the moderate HA without FVIII inhibitors receiving FVIII prophylaxis. The results of 
these studies highlight the significant unmet medical need in the moderate HA population, as evidenced 
by considerable amount of bleeds, despite the heavy treatment burden. Data for mild patients are scarce 
and not reported separately. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 10/92 
 
 
 
 
In addition, currently available FVIII replacement therapy carries a high treatment burden and non-
adherence continues to be a frequent problem due to it. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Emicizumab (also known as ACE910, RO5534262, and Hemlibra) is a recombinant, humanised, bispecific 
immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that bridges with moderate affinity activated factor IX (FIXa) 
and factor X (FX), mimicking the co-factor function of FVIII. In patients with HA, haemostasis can be 
restored irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors, as emicizumab shares no sequence homology 
with FVIII. In addition, emicizumab offers the possibility of SC administration, removing the need for 
venous access. Finally, because of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of 
this antibody, use of emicizumab enables a dosing interval of once a week (QW), every 2 weeks (Q2W), 
or every 4 weeks (Q4W). 
As of 23 July 2021, emicizumab is approved in 105 countries worldwide for routine prophylaxis to prevent 
or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and paediatric patients with HA (congenital FVIII 
deficiency) with FVIII inhibitors. A total of 92 countries also have an approval in patients without FVIII 
inhibitors, including the United States, Canada, and Japan. In the European Union, the approval in 
patients without FVIII inhibitors is restricted to individuals with severe disease only. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In 2018, the MAH had already sought an extension of indication for the treatment of HA without inhibitors 
(EMEA/H/C/004406/II/02). The advice of the ad hoc expert group convened on 25 January 2019 was the 
following: 
- In principle, there would be a clinical need for safe and effective medicines for a subgroup of patients 
with moderate haemophilia for whom prophylaxis is considered appropriate (e.g., patients with FVIII 
levels less than 5%), particularly if easy to administer compared to frequent intravenous administration 
of existing options.  
- However, in the case of Hemlibra, due to lack of exhaustive pre-clinical data, and lack of clinical data, it 
is not possible to conclude that the product has relevant efficacy in this population. It is indeed possible, 
that the efficacy observed in severe haemophilia cannot be easily extrapolated to patients with higher 
levels of FVIII. Furthermore, the submitted in vitro data are too limited to predict the complexity of the 
coagulation system in vivo and justify any extrapolation from severe to moderate haemophilia. More 
importantly, there are safety concerns from a pharmacodynamic point of view (long half-life; 
irreversibility of the effect) and the risk of acute or chronic thrombosis given the observation of 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thromboembolic events in 5 patients who received emicizumab as 
routine prophylaxis in the clinical programme. Clinical and extensive non-clinical data should be available 
before the benefits and risks can be properly assessed in non-severe haemophilia. 
- The company’s laboratory and non-clinical data submitted are not sufficient to address the safety 
concerns (mainly the risk of thrombosis and TMA) and do not predict its clinical effects. There was also 
concern regarding how effective Hemlibra would be with measurable levels of circulating FVIII given the 
PK data. Clinical data (and extensive non-clinical data) should be available before the benefits and risks 
can be sufficiently assessed in patients with non-severe haemophilia. 
- The experts agreed that a clinical trial in the relevant population is warranted to demonstrate efficacy. 
Concerning safety, extensive non-clinical studies and laboratory markers (such as markers of thrombosis 
and of thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombin, AT, D-Dimer, TGA with a suitable triggering agent, FVIII 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 11/92 
 
 
 
 
central assessment) in this clinical study would provide useful information about the risk of thrombosis 
and TMA. A post-authorisation safety study would likely also be needed considering that a clinical trial 
may not be adequately powered to fully address safety concerns. 
- In addition, the lack of data in children less than 1 year and the need to generate data in this group 
given that not only PK but also the coagulation system is likely to be different in the newborn children 
was also raised. 
Taking into account the above advice of SAG and considering the lack of data and because of the risk of 
thrombosis in patient with appreciable endogenous FVIII activity when exposed to emicizumab and the 
risk of TMA, the CHMP concluded that no recommendation can be made to grant the indication in mild 
and moderate HA patients without inhibitors. Therefore, the approval in patients without inhibitors was 
restricted to subjects with severe HA at that time.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that all Sponsor studies included in this submission were conducted in accordance with 
the principles of GCP, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the local laws and regulations of the 
countries in which the studies were conducted. Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards 
reviewed and approved the studies as appropriate. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
An addendum to the 2.4 Nonclinical Overview is submitted: 
• 
• 
• 
To provide a rationale for why studies in mild to moderate hemophilia A animal models are not 
feasible and/or appropriate;  
To explain why the in vitro and in vivo data provide the best available basis for nonclinical risk 
assessment in this indication;  
To further support the low potential of procoagulant emicizumab – FVIII interactions. 
Thrombotic events in patients with single factor coagulation deficits including hemophilia A are generally 
rare. The procoagulant interaction potential of emicizumab with FVIII has been addressed in a series of in 
vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies to identify risks for patients with low residual FVIII activity present in 
mild-to-moderate human hemophilia A or for patients receiving direct co-medication with FVIII.  
Overall, FVIIIa cofactor activity and physiology is consistent with a relatively low prothrombotic liability. 
This is supported by the clinical experience of the therapeutic use of factor FVIII concentrates, which are 
generally associated with a relatively low risk of thrombotic adverse events, even at high doses [Coppola 
et al. 2012]. A prothrombotic risk has been described in patients with abnormally high plasma levels of 
FVIII [Kyrle et al. 2000]. 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys showed no indication of prothrombotic effects at 
high steady state emicizumab exposure on top of the normal endogenous FVIII activity. In particular, no 
thrombus-related histopathological changes were seen in any organs or tissues at emicizumab doses of 
up to 100 mg/kg/week in the 4-week IV toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Similarly, no thrombus-associated gross or histopathological changes in any organs or tissues were seen 
in the pathology examinations at subcutaneous (SC) emicizumab doses of up to 30 mg/kg/week for 26 
weeks. Clinically relevant markers of increased fibrinolysis (D-dimers, fibrinogen degradation product- 
FDP) typically observed when thrombi are formed were not elevated in these studies.  
Because emicizumab is a humanised antibody, which is a foreign protein for Cynomolgus monkeys, anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs) developed in animals in the repeated dose toxicology studies. However, 
neutralising antibodies were only observed in a minority of the animals.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 12/92 
 
 
 
 
 
As the majority of animals had relevant exposure levels to emicizumab during the entire dosing phases, 
these studies represent clinically relevant in vivo models and readouts to assess potential prothrombotic 
FVIII emicizumab interactions at chronic long term exposure conditions.  
The effect of emicizumab on thrombus formation was also compared with the effect of FVIII treatment in 
an acute model of venous stasis in normo-coagulative Cynomolgus monkeys. In this study, provoked 
thrombus formation of emicizumab was equal to the thrombus formation induced by additive FVIII 
activity, indicating that the risk of FVIII-emicizumab interactions causing thrombosis is similar to the risk 
of high FVIII concentrations. 
Although emicizumab facilitates the intrinsic tenase reaction, its affinity for FIXa or FX is however at least 
10-fold lower than that of FVIIIa and accordingly, the FIXa-catalyzed FX activation rate is about 1/44 of 
the reaction rate induced by FVIIIa. Therefore, a low potential of synergistic interaction of emicizumab 
with FVIII was demonstrated in-vitro in a thrombin generation assay in this dossier. A small additive 
effect was noted at low dose emicizumab FVIII combinations. At FVIII concentrations of 1 IU/mL 
(corresponding to 100 IU/dL normocoagulative FVIII levels) emicizumab showed only marginal or no 
effect on thrombin generation (TG), indicating that FVIII effectively competes with emicizumab on FIXa-
FX binding. The potency for a low additive procoagulant emicizumab FVIII interaction and the loss of 
emicizumab activity at increasing FVIII concentrations has also recently been reported by others in 
thrombin generation assays [Bravo et al. 2020], FXa generation assays [Minami et al. 2018] or in assays 
using modified clot waveform analysis [Nogami et al. 2018; Nakajima et al. 2020]. 
Emicizumab does not affect the inhibitory pathways of the clotting system. Emicizumab did not interfere 
with antithrombotic regulation of antithrombin or Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) activity in vitro 
[Noguchi-Sasaki et al. 2018]. 
Although unlike FVIIIa, emicizumab is not inactivated by APC (Activated Protein C)-mediated proteolysis, 
APC-catalyzed FVa proteolysis could however still downregulate emicizumab-driven hemostasis [Yada et 
al. 2018]. 
Further in vivo studies in particular studies mimicking the more complex mild to moderate hemophilia 
hemostatic and potential pro-thrombotic disease pathology of low FVIII levels have not been conducted 
because predictive models with a human translatable mild-to-moderate phenotype do not exist. 
Although the severity of hemophilia A is generally associated with the grade of FVIII coagulant deficiency, 
the clinical severity does not always fully correlate with the FVIII in vitro clotting activity.  
The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) has therefore defined the three major stages of hemophilia A 
as a relationship of bleeding severity to clotting factor levels [Srivastava et al. 2020]. Severe hemophilia 
A is defined as FVIII <1% of normal with spontaneous bleeding into joints or muscles, predominantly in 
the absence of identifiable hemostatic challenge. The moderate form has typically FVIII of 1- 5% of 
normal with occasional spontaneous bleeding and prolonged bleeding with minor trauma or surgery, while 
mild hemophilia A with FVIII 5 to <40% of normal show severe bleeding with major trauma or surgery 
but only rare spontaneous bleeding. 
Nonclinical research in hemophilia A has been focused on models of severe hemophilia A. Such models 
have been established via targeted ablation of the FVIII gene in mice and alternatively, strains of rats, 
dogs and sheep with a congenital FVIII deficiency have been selected and bred in colonies. These well-
characterised disease models have mostly replaced experimentally induced acquired hemophilia 
conditions where FVIII is depleted with anti FVIII monoclonal antibodies. A natural hemophilia A disease 
to establish a primate hemophilia A colony has not been discovered in the Cynomolgus monkey.  
For the nonclinical characterisation of emicizumab in Cynomolgus monkeys, a FVIII depleting procedure 
was therefore used as the method of choice to establish a relevant model of hemophilia A. 
Defined by their complete FVIII functional deficiency, all these models mimic the severe form of 
hemophilia A in humans. Their bleeding phenotype is however variable and differs quite significantly 
between species and strains. There is consensus that these models do not fully and accurately 
recapitulate the bleeding phenotype of the human disease described above. Hemophilia A mice, unlike in 
man, in general, show no spontaneous bleeding. Spontaneous bleeding is one of the criteria important for

differentiation of the 3 gradings of the human disease, while in hemophilia A mice as in the human 
disease provoked injuries e.g., skin cuts are prone to severe and sometimes life-threatening bleeding 
complications. Despite such phenotypic differences, the experimental work done in severe hemophilia A 
models, have immensely helped to advance our understanding of hemostatic complications of factor VIII 
deficiency. 
Experimentally induced provoked bleeding methods are, as in the studies with emicizumab, often applied 
to simulate more closely human spontaneous hemorrhagic pathologies. 
Options to run studies with emicizumab in milder forms of hemophilia A than the originally submitted 
efficacy study of an acquired severe hemophilia A Cynomolgus monkey model are therefore not available 
in the NHP. Targeted partial FVIII depletion is not feasible and persistent long term low level steady-state 
FVIII substitution with porcine FVIII, which lacks cross-reactivity to the depleting monoclonal antibody, is 
also not an option due to the fast clearance of FVIII. 
Recently, a modified FVIII deficient hemophilia A mouse model has been published as an opportunity to 
investigate emicizumab effects in an alternative species to the Cynomolgus monkey [Ferriere et al. 2020]. 
In this model, FVIII knock-out (ko) mice were rendered humanised by infusions of human FIX and FX 
prior to functional in vivo hemostasis tests. Of interest, the model has also been used to investigate the 
interaction of emicizumab with FVIII on hemostasis tests under such experimental short-term conditions. 
Consistent with in vitro results, the interaction data showed that emicizumab provides additional 
procoagulant activity at low but not at high concentrations of FVIII. While this is a valuable model for 
acute hemostasis readouts, it cannot be adapted to a functional stable steady-state in vivo mild to 
moderate long-term model due to the rapid clearance of FVIII, FIX and FX. This dilemma can theoretically 
be minimised by crossbreeding of FVIII ko mice with human factor IX and X (hFIX & X) knock-in mice as 
previously presented [Li et al. 2018]. The hFIX&X knock-in mice carry however already a mild hemophilic 
phenotype which limits the human translatability of such data. Furthermore, the need and problems with 
stable low steady-state FVIII substitution infusions remain, however, unsolved in this model. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Emicizumab is a recombinant bispecific monoclonal antibody. Emicizumab is a large protein with a 
molecular mass of approximately 146 kDa. Like all monoclonal antibodies, Emicizumab is not bioavailable 
by oral pathway but is extensively degraded in the patient’s body by regular proteolytic mechanisms 
before excretion; hence, it is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
In support of this statement, a Manometric Respirometry Test showed that formulated Emicizumab 
(including excipients) is readily biodegradable. The mineralisation for the active substance Emicizumab 
(deducting the BOD for the excipients, which were shown to be readily biodegradable themselves) 
corresponded to 99% by day 28 and 90% at the end of the 10-day window. Therefore, while Emicizumab 
may normally be expected to be degraded by regular human protein metabolism in the patient, based on 
the attained ready biodegradability any Emicizumab that might escape human metabolic degradation may 
be safely expected to be biodegraded in sewage works and surface waters. 
Ecotoxicity limit tests with green algae (Desmodesmus subspicatus), daphnids (Daphnia magna) and fish 
were performed with emicizumab formulated solution under GLP. All three limit tests consistently showed 
no adverse effects at the only tested concentration of 100 mg/l nominal concentration relating to the 
active substance emicizumab. These tests underpin a low risk for unexpected aquatic ecotoxicity of 
emicizumab, particularly considering the rapid, far-reaching removal expected through biodegradation in 
sewage treatment. 
As supporting evidence, several monoclonal antibodies and other protein active pharmaceutical 
substances were tested for biodegradability and acute ecotoxicity. All unaltered monoclonal antibodies, 
without exception, proved to be readily biodegradable, resulting in very low predicted environmental 
concentrations in receiving waters. In addition, acute ecotoxicity was not remarkable for any of the 
monoclonal antibodies (Kümmerer and Hempel, 2010).

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical studies have been carried out to support the extension of indication of emicizumab 
(Hemlibra) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with mild or moderate disease. 
Instead, the MAH has provided a rationale for why studies in mild to moderate hemophilia A animal 
models are not feasible and/or appropriate, an explanation why the in vitro and in vivo data provide the 
best available basis for nonclinical risk assessment in this indication, and information to further support 
the low potential of procoagulant emicizumab – FVIII interactions. 
Based on the considerations and data outlined above, it is concluded that none of the nonclinical in vivo 
models of hemophilia A would provide relevant information on the thrombosis risk at therapeutically 
relevant emicizumab exposure translatable to humans. 
A human risk extrapolation for using emicizumab in mild-to-moderate hemophilia A patients can however 
be done using available in vitro and in vivo data. Due to its significantly lower affinity for FIXa or FX 
compared with FVIIIa, FVIIIa competes with increasing concentrations with emicizumab for FIXa-FX 
binding and activation, leading to a gradual loss of emicizumab activity indicated by a low additive 
procoagulant potential.  
The data provided in this application demonstrated this overall low additive procoagulant and 
prothrombotic interaction potential of FVIII with emicizumab in various in vitro clotting assays. Further in 
vivo studies in a provoked thrombosis model in the Cynomolgus monkey and in particular long term 
toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkey combining the two risk factors of normocoagulative endogenous 
FVIII activity with high plasma exposure of emicizumab showed no evidence for prothrombotic 
complications, using sensitive measurements like histopathology and serum markers of fibrinolysis. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
None of the nonclinical in vivo models of haemophilia A would provide relevant information on the 
translatable to humans thrombosis risk to therapeutically relevant emicizumab exposure. Thus, new non 
clinical studies were not carried out, which is acceptable. Justifications taking into account available in 
vitro and in vivo data can be considered to support this application. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of emicizumab.  
- Considering the above data, emicizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

In addition to the studies mentioned above, and as of 12 August 2021, emicizumab clinical program 
includes the following studies (Phase III and above): 
• YO39309 (HAVEN 5): An ongoing Phase III study in Chinese patients with HA regardless of FVIII 
inhibitor status 
• MO41787 (HAVEN 7): An ongoing global Phase IIIb study in infants (0-12 months old) with HA without 
inhibitors 
• MO39129 (STASEY): A completed Phase IIIb global safety study in adult and adolescent (≥12 years 
old) patients with HA with inhibitors 
• MO42245 (HemiNorth 2): A planned Phase IV study in adult and adolescent patients (12-51 years old) 
with severe HA without inhibitors in the Nordic countries 
• MO42623 (BEYOND ABR): A planned global Phase IV study in adult and adolescent (≥12 years old) 
patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A without inhibitors 
The original MAA, which resulted in approval for the indication in adult and paediatric patients with HA 
with inhibitors to FVIII in EU, comprised results from the pivotal Phase III Study HAVEN 1 in patients ≥12 
years of age and interim results from the pivotal Study HAVEN 2 in children <12 years of age (along with 
supporting data from three Phase I and Phase I/II studies: ACE001JP, ACE002JP, and JP29574). 
The 2018 Variation EMEA/H/C/004406/II/02 submission that granted the EOI to non-inhibitor patients 
with severe HA (FVIII level <1%) included clinical data from the pivotal Phase III Studies HAVEN 3 and 
HAVEN 4, and updated results from pivotal Study HAVEN 2 (along with supporting data from HAVEN 1 
and ACE002JP). 
The current application includes data from the new Phase III Study BO41423 (HAVEN 6), which was 
designed to provide clinical safety and efficacy evidence to support the EOI to include adult and paediatric 
patients of all ages with mild and moderate HA without inhibitors to FVIII that warrant prophylactic 
treatment.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK discussion for this variation comes from PK data of study BO41423 (HAVEN 6) and population PK 
analysis.

Study BO41423 (HAVEN 6) 
In patients who received the emicizumab QW regimen, mean trough plasma concentrations of 
emicizumab increased with loading doses of 3 mg/kg QW to achieve 61.8 microg/mL at Week 5. Mean 
trough concentrations of approximately 60 microg/mL were maintained from Week 9 to Week 25 with 
maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW. 
In patients who received the emicizumab Q2W regimen, mean trough plasma, concentrations of 
emicizumab increased with loading doses of 3 mg/kg QW to achieve 60.2 microg/mL at Week 5. Mean 
trough concentrations of approximately 53 microg/mL were maintained from Week 9 to Week 25 with 
maintenance doses of 3 mg/kg Q2W. 
In patients who received the emicizumab Q4W regimen, mean trough plasma concentrations of 
emicizumab increased with loading doses of 3 mg/kg QW to achieve 59.2 microg/mL at Week 5. Mean 
trough concentrations of approximately 45 microg/mL were maintained from Week 9 to Week 25 with 
maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg Q4W. 
Overall, the variability was moderate (coefficient of variations usually below 35%), with range of 
individual trough plasma concentrations after Week 5 between 19.1 and 128 microg/mL after QW doses 
of 1.5 mg/kg, between 14.0 and 110 microg/mL after Q2W doses of 3 mg/kg, and between 30.1 and 65.4 
microg/mL after Q4W doses of 6 mg/kg.

The PK data were generally similar for patients with mild haemophilia A and moderate haemophilia A. 
However, trough concentrations were on average 15% higher than those reported with corresponding 
dosing regimens in HAVEN 1 to 4 studies, with inconsistent overlap of the 95% confidence intervals.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK modelling 
The population PK model developed in severe haemophilia A patients was able to properly predict the PK 
profiles in mild and moderate haemophilia A patients. For the QW and Q2W dosing regimen, the observed 
5th percentiles and median are slightly above the 95% confidence interval for the initial part of the PK 
time course. Those small differences between observations and predictions are likely to be due to the 
limited sample size. 
The principal difference between the previous HAVEN studies and Study BO41423 resides in the severity 
of the disease, with mild and moderate patients enrolled only in Study BO41423 while the vast majority 
of patients in the previous HAVEN studies had severe haemophilia (a few patients with inhibitors against 
FVIII had mild or moderate haemophilia). Of note, the presence of residual endogenous FVIII in patients 
with mild or moderate haemophilia A is not expected to interfere with the ELISA used to measure

emicizumab concentration. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic data were generally similar between 
patients with mild haemophilia A (n=20) and with moderate haemophilia A (n=51) in Study BO41423, 
indicating that the difference in residual FVIII activity is not the reason behind the higher exposure 
observed in Study BO41423. 
Of note, the increase of emicizumab concentrations in Study BO41423 remains overall limited, and the 
safety observed in Study BO41423 was comparable with other clinical studies of emicizumab. Altogether, 
this supports the use of emicizumab in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia A.

2.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
FVIII activity 
Chromogenic FVIII Activity Assay with Human Factors: FVIII activity between 1 U/dL (LLOQ of the assay) 
and 65 U/dL at baseline was observed in most patients reflecting their residual endogenous FVIII activity 
and the use of FVIII prior to study entry in some patients. Following initiation of treatment with 
emicizumab, mean reported FVIII activity increased to achieve approximately 38 U/dL (mean range 
across the three dosing regimens: 34.50-38.46 U/dL) at Week 5 and remained stable thereafter, while 
patients were treated with emicizumab. Sporadic elevated reported FVIII values observed in patients 
throughout the study duration are a consequence of FVIII use during the study. Declining reported FVIII 
Assessment report

activity was observed in one patient from week 13 reaching a minimum of 4 U/dL at Week 25 with 
concomitant decrease in PK to ~20 ug/mL at Week 25. The patient tested negative for ADA. 
Chromogenic FVIII Activity Assay with Bovine Factors: This assay is insensitive to emicizumab (no activity 
measured) and was used to monitor endogenous or infused FVIII activity. FVIII activity between 6 U/dL 
(LLOQ of the assay) and 55 U/dL was observed in 30 patients at baseline reflecting their endogenous 
FVIII activity or the use of FVIII prior to study entry in some patients. 39 patients had baseline FVIII 
activity <6 U/dL. 15 of the patients with detectable baseline FVIII activity had the diagnosis of mild HA. 
FVIII activity levels were maintained at 6-21 U/dL throughout the observation period in 14 patients 
reflecting their endogenous FVIII activity. 11 of these patients had the diagnosis of mild HA. The other 
patients with detectable baseline FVIII activity had FVIII activity below LLOQ at subsequent timepoints. 
The LLOQ of this assay is 6 U/dL, thus the endogenous FVIII activity was not detectable in the majority of 
the moderate patients, where activity levels between 1 U/dL and 5 U/dL are expected. Sporadic elevated 
FVIII values observed in patients throughout the study duration are a consequence of FVIII use during 
the study. 
Factor VIII Protein 
FVIII protein levels for most patients were between 2 U/dL (LLOQ of the assay) and 92 U/dL at baseline, 
reflecting endogenous and infused FVIII protein levels. FVIII protein levels were generally stable over the 
study period. One patient had a high FVIII protein level from baseline to week 5 (92-143 U/dL), which 
then decreased at week 9 and stayed lower (27-56 U/dL) for the rest of the study. FVIII activity 
measured using the chromogenic assay with bovine proteins, in this patient, was <6 U/dL throughout the 
study period. The patient remained negative for FVIII inhibitors throughout the study. Two patients had 
baseline FVIII protein levels of 55 U/dL and 63 U/dL, which doubled to week 2 and were maintained 
thereafter. Other biomarker measurements in these two patients at baseline failed due to questionable 
sample integrity, which may have also affected the FVIII protein level baseline measurements. 
Thrombin Generation 
Thrombin generation was detected at baseline in most patients reflecting endogenous FVIII activity or the 
use of FVIII by these patients prior to study entry and during the first week after initial emicizumab 
administration. Sporadic elevated peak height values observed in patients throughout the study duration 
across treatment arms are also a consequence of FVIII use during the study. Despite the effects of 
endogenous FVIII and concomitant FVIII usage on the time course of individual patients, the mean peak 
height can be seen to increase during emicizumab loading doses and stabilize at approximately 150 nM 
and 90 nM from Week 5 onward by Thrombin Generation Assay Triggered by Factor XIa or by Tissue 
Factor respectively. The observed trend in the mean values over time is similar between FXIa and TF 
triggered thrombin generation. 
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 
For most patients, aPTT was elevated at baseline as expected due to the deficiency of FVIII; aPTT values 
in the normal range at baseline in a number of patients likely reflects the use of FVIII therapy by these 
patients prior to study entry. After the 1st dose of emicizumab, aPTT was normalized at Week 2 in all but 
one patient, in whom aPTT was normalized at Week 3. This is likely a local lab data issue as the patients 
reported FVIII activity (measured with the chromogenic assay containing human proteins) increased from 
2 U/dL at baseline to 13 U/dL at Week 2. aPTT remained largely within normal limits for the entire 
duration of treatment. Several patients had values consistently under the lower limit of normal, which is 
an expected pharmacodynamic effect of emicizumab.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic Results 
Following initiation of treatment with emicizumab, mean reported FVIII activity increased to achieve 
approximately 38 U/dL (mean range across the three dosing regimens: 34.50-38.46 U/dL) at Week 5 and 
remained stable thereafter. Sporadic elevated reported FVIII values observed in patients throughout the 
study duration are a consequence of FVIII use during the study. 
Endogenous FVIII activity and protein levels were generally stable over the study period. 
Thrombin generation was detected at baseline in most patients. Sporadic elevated peak height values 
observed in patients throughout the study duration are also a consequence of FVIII use during the study. 
Despite the effects of endogenous FVIII and concomitant FVIII usage on the time course of individual 
patients, the mean peak height can be seen to increase during emicizumab loading doses and stabilise at 
approximately 150 nM (FXIa-triggered TG) or 90 nM (low TF-triggered TG) from Week 5 onward. 
For most patients, aPTT was elevated at baseline as expected due to the deficiency of FVIII. After the first 
dose of emicizumab, aPTT was normalised at Week 2 in all but one patient, in whom aPTT was normalised 
at Week 3. aPTT remained within or below normal limits (reference ranges defined by local laboratories) 
for the entire duration of treatment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The analyses of biomarkers such as FVIII activity, FVIII protein, TGA triggered by FXIa/ TF and aPTT 
show consistent pharmacodynamics effects with emicizumab mechanism of action as well as with prior 
HAVEN studies. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
BO41423 (Haven 6): A multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab in patients 
with mild or moderate haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors. 
Methods 
This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase III study. Approximately 70 patients of all age groups 
were planned to be enrolled, including approximately 20 patients with mild HA and 50 patients with 
moderate HA that warrant prophylaxis. The interim analysis presented in this CSR was performed after 50 
patients with moderate HA had completed 24 weeks of emicizumab treatment or had withdrawn from 
treatment.

During the study, individual bleeds were captured by the patient as the bleeds occur using a Bleed and 
Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) on a weekly basis to record whether a bleed has occurred and whether 
treatment for a bleed or treatment to prevent a bleed (e.g., prior to surgery or short-term prophylaxis 
prior to increased activity) has been given. Breakthrough bleeds should be treated with FVIII at the 
lowest dose expected to achieve haemostasis. When a bleed has occurred, patients were required to 
report bleed information details (e.g., site, type, day, time) and medication details including reason for 
the use of FVIII (e.g., treatment of a bleed, preventative dose before activity), agent, start time, dose, 
route of administration, and number of infusions needed to treat the bleed via the BMQ.

Treatments 
The emicizumab dosing regimen was 4 loading doses of emicizumab 3 mg/kg SC QW for 4 weeks followed 
by a maintenance dose of either 1.5 mg/kg SC QW, 3 mg/kg SC Q2W, or 6 mg/kg SC Q4W based on

study until completion of at least 52W. 
Dose-up titration  
After 24W on prophylactic emicizumab, all patients with suboptimal bleed control (defined as ≥2 
qualifying bleeds within 24W while on prophylactic emicizumab) could be offered the option to increase 
their dose to 3 mg/kg QW. A qualifying bleed was defined as spontaneous, verified by investigator (e.g., 
by imaging or physical examination), and occurring while on prophylactic emicizumab at steady state 
(after W5).

Permitted Therapy 
- Regular FVIII prophylaxis may continue until the 2nd emicizumab loading dose to avoid bleeds before 
adequate emicizumab levels are reached. Concomitant routine FVIII prophylaxis is otherwise not 
permissible during the study. 
- For the treatment of breakthrough bleeds, FVIII should be used at the lowest dose expected to achieve 
haemostasis. Given that circulating emicizumab may increase patients’ coagulation potential, the doses 
required to achieve haemostasis may be lower than FVIII doses used prior to the study.  
- Other drugs intended to control bleeds (e.g., bypassing agents, DDAVP, or antifibrinolytics).  
- Drugs and therapies to treat AEs and use of topical antiseptics, anaesthetics, eye drops, etc.  
- Drugs to treat an existing medical condition ongoing at study entry that does not violate the eligibility 
criteria (e.g., anti-retroviral therapy for HIV infections) 
Prohibited Therapy 
- Drugs that would affect haemostasis (e.g., aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are not 
selective or preferential COX-2 inhibitors, or anticoagulants [other than to flush, dwell, or declot a venous

Efficacy endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Number of treated bleeds over time (i.e., bleed rate) 
Annualized bleed rate (ABR) = (Number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) × 365.25 
72-hour rule: Two bleeds of the same type (e.g., “joint”, “muscle”, or “other”) and at the same 
anatomical location were considered to be one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from 
the last treatment for the first bleed. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
- Number of all bleeds (i.e., those treated and untreated with FVIII) over time 
- Number of joint bleeds over time 
- Number of target joint bleeds over time. Target joints are defined as joints with ≥3 bleeds occurring in 
the same joint during the last 24 weeks or unresolved target joints (defined as a target joint that does 
not fulfil the criterion of ≤2 bleeds into this joint within a consecutive 12-month period.) 
- Number of spontaneous bleeds over time (spontaneous bleed rate) 
- Joint health, as assessed through use of the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) at specified 
timepoints 
- Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), as assessed through use of the Comprehensive Assessment Tool 
of Challenges in Hemophilia (CATCH) Questionnaire over time 
- Preference for emicizumab compared with previous FVIII regimen, as assessed through use of the 
Emicizumab Preference Survey (EmiPref) at Week 17  
- Effect of emicizumab prophylaxis treatment on physical activity compared with physical activity at 
baseline 
- Effect of emicizumab prophylaxis treatment on menstruation heaviness and menstruation-related 
quality of life in female patients of childbearing potential, as assessed through the use of the Menstrual 
Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ) and the Menstruation Diary (MD) with the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart 
(PBAC) over time. 
PK endpoints: Plasma concentration of emicizumab at specified timepoints 
Immunogenicity endpoints:  
- Prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at baseline and incidence of ADAs during the study 
- Number and proportion of patients who develop anti-FVIII inhibitors (titer≥0.6 BU/mL) at specified 
timepoints 
Exploratory endpoints:  
Biomarker: PD parameters including but not limited to thrombin generation, FVIII activity, FVIII protein, 
D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF1+2) at regular intervals throughout the study and at times

of treated bleeds. Changes over time in biomarkers related to bone and joint health may also be 
explored. 
Health status utility: change from baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) 
index utility and visual analog scale (VAS) scores at specified timepoints. 
Assessment 
Clinical outcomes assessments were collected through use of the following instruments: 
Bleed medication questionnaire (BMQ), CATCH, EmiPref, EQ-5D-5L, MBQ, and MD with PBAC. 
Sample size 
The overall sample size of approximately 70 patients (approximately 50 patients with moderate disease 
and approximately 20 patients with mild disease) was based primarily on feasibility and clinical 
considerations, taking into account the limited number of patients with non-severe haemophilia A.  
The current interim analysis, intended for regulatory submissions, was performed once 50 patients with 
moderate haemophilia A had completed 24 weeks of emicizumab treatment, were lost to follow-up, or 
withdrawn, whichever occurred first. This was considered to be a sufficient period of time to reliably 
assess the effect of emicizumab prophylaxis on bleed rate reduction.  
Additional interim data reviews may be performed at various time points for regulatory submissions. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable, this is a single arm open-label study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this is a single arm open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Treated population corresponds to all patients who received at least one dose of emicizumab. This 
population was the primary population for efficacy and safety analyses. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
There was no multiplicity adjustment planned for this study. The efficacy objectives of this study were 
investigated without any formal hypothesis testing. All analyses were of descriptive nature only. 
Analysis of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy period 
The efficacy period for each individual patient is defined as the number of days starting from the day of 
first emicizumab dose to the day of clinical cut-off or withdrawal from the study, whichever is earlier. For 
patients whose dose is up-titrated, the efficacy period ends a day prior to the first day on the up-titrated 
dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 27/92 
 
 
 
 
 
Bleed Rate 
The efficacy of emicizumab was characterised by the number of bleeds over time. This was calculated 
using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with time 
that each patient stayed in the study (efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. In addition, the 
number of bleeds was also annualized for each patient using the following formula: 
Annualized bleed rate (ABR) = (Number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) × 365.25. 
The mean and median ABR based on the above formula using the observed numbers of bleeds instead of 
the number resulting from the model was calculated. In the case where the negative binomial model did 
not converge, this alternative derivation of the ABR were used as the sole method of analysis. 
ABR corresponding to treated bleeds, all bleeds, treated joint bleeds, treated target joint bleeds, and 
treated spontaneous bleeds were analysed in a similar manner. These were summarised for all patients 
and listed for each patient individually. Several exploratory analyses were conducted to characterise the 
type (joint bleed, muscle bleed, other bleed), location, and frequency. 
72-Hour Rule: 
For treated bleeds, two bleeds of the same type (e.g., “joint”, “muscle”, or “other”) and at the same 
anatomical location were considered to be one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from 
the last treatment for the first bleed. The last treatment was defined as the last treatment before a new 
bleed occurred, either in the same or in a different location. 
For non-treated bleeds (not followed by any treatments with coagulation factors before the recording of a 
subsequent bleed), this "72-Hour rule" is implemented by calculating a treatment-free period of 72 hours 
from the bleed itself. When implementing the 72-Hour rule, bleeds due to surgeries or procedures are 
excluded. 
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
For the CATCH questionnaire, descriptive analyses including summaries and 95% confidence intervals of 
change from baseline for each individual subscale were performed. Patient compliance with the CATCH 
was summarized at each assessed time point. 
For the EmiPref patient preference questionnaire, the proportion of patients/caregivers preferring either 
emicizumab after 17 weeks of treatment or previous haemophilia treatment regimen was presented with 
95% CIs. The proportion of patients selecting each reason for their preference and the top three 
preferred reasons affecting the patient preference were also summarized. Patient/caregiver compliance 
with the EmiPref was summarized for Week 17. 
Summary statistics of the number and proportion of days away from school/work and days hospitalized 
was presented. 
Joint Health and Physical Activity 
The HJHS measures joint health of the joints most commonly affected by bleeding in haemophilia. The 
HJHS 2.1 provides joint specific total scores which are added to obtain the sum of joints totals and also a 
global gait score. These two scores are then added to obtain HJHS total score. For the HJHS, descriptive 
analyses were presented by time point. 
Analyses were presented by time point. 
Patients (≥5 years of age) were instructed to wear an accelerometer continuously (24 hr/day) every day 
for designated 2-week periods during the study as follows: Weeks 1-2, Weeks 12-13, Weeks 24-25, 
Weeks 36-37, and Weeks 48-49. All enrolled subjects who contributed to valid activity data were 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 28/92 
 
 
 
 
analysed for activity. Relative change from baseline (Weeks 1−2 period) at Weeks 13 (Weeks 12−13 
period), 25 (Weeks 24−25 period), 37 (Weeks 36−37 period), and 49 (Weeks 48−49 period) in mean 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and daily step count (DSC) were calculated and 
summarised. Subject-level data were also presented at each time point. 
Menstruation Heaviness and Menstruation-related Quality of Life 
MBQ was summarized descriptively over time, including change from baseline for individual subscales 
(heaviness, quality of life, irregularity, and pain) and total score. PBAC scores were summarized 
descriptively over time. If the number of female patients of childbearing potential was too low to provide 
reliable summaries, the data were listed and presented in individual patient plots, where applicable. 
Missing data 
On the electronic handheld device, it is not possible to leave questions unanswered or to enter partial 
data in one BMQ. 
In the site data entry system, it is possible to leave the time (but not the date) of a treatment or a bleed 
blank because the caregiver might not be able to remember these in a reliable way. 
In order to implement the 72-hour rule, it is assumed that the bleeds and treatments with missing time 
occurred at 12:00 a.m. If at a given day only the treatment time or the bleed time is partial and the other 
one complete, the partial time is assumed to be the same as the complete time. In case of multiple 
events per day, the last complete time is used. 
Subgroup analyses 
Additional descriptive summaries of both treated bleeds and all bleeds were computed for various 
subgroups of the study. The summaries included subgroup ABR and its 95% CIs. The main pre-specified 
subgroups are as follows: 
-  Age: 0 to <2, 2 to <6, 6 to <12, 12 to <18, 18 to <65, ≥65 years 
-  Race: Asian, Black or African American, White, Other 
-  Haemophilia severity: mild, moderate 
-  Number of target joints at study entry: no target joint, any target joint 
- 
- 
- 
Previous treatment regimen: prior episodic, prior prophylactic 
Prior FVIII inhibitor: Yes/No 
Female patient: Yes/No 
-  Dosing regimens at enrolment: 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W, 6 mg/kg Q4W 
Changes to planned analyses 
The study first patient enrolled was on 10 February 2020, and the data cut-off for this interim was 16 
April 2021. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was finalised on 15 June 2020 (4 months after first patient 
enrolled). 
There were no changes in the planned analyses for the study before database lock. 
Following database lock, coagulation marker (aPTT and PT/INR) values at four centres needed additional 
cleaning; thus these data were re-cleaned after the original lock date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023

At the pre-submission meeting on 12th July 2021, several additional outputs were discussed and were 
subsequently generated. These included comparisons of bleeds before and after study entry (i.e., baseline 
vs post-baseline), as well as additional plots of coagulation markers. 
Results 
The submitted data present an interim analysis of efficacy, safety, PD, and PK data in Study HAVEN 6 
based on a clinical cut-off date of 16 April 2021, after 50 patients with moderate HA without inhibitors 
had completed 24 weeks of emicizumab treatment, or withdrawn from treatment, or were lost to follow-
up, whichever occurred first. 
Participant flow 
Of the 81 patients screened, 72 patients were enrolled in the study. The main reasons for screen failure 
were:  
- meeting one of the exclusion criteria (3 patients),  
- not meeting one of the inclusion criteria (3 patients)  
- or other (not respecting the screening window/withdrew consent, other) (3 patients). 
Table 2 Patient Disposition (All Enrolled Patients) 
Recruitment 
First patient in: 10 February 2020. The 50th patient with moderate HA without inhibitors for triggering 
this interim analysis was enrolled on 30 October 2020. The recruitment is ongoing. 
The cutoff date for analyses is 16 April 2021.  
Patients were enrolled at 22 sites in 10 countries: UK (n=11), France (n=11), US (n=10), Germany 
(n=9), Belgium (n=8), South Africa (n=6), Spain (n=5), Canada (n=5), Poland (n=4) and The 
Netherlands (n=3). 
Due to disruption of COVID-19, enrollment in the trial was paused from 25 March to 20 May 2020 at all 
sites and restarted. The impact of the pandemic was limited as the study was at the stage of recruitment

start with only 2 patients having been enrolled (in South Africa) when the pandemic occurred. Those 2 
patients continued to receive treatment at home. 
An eResearch Technology (ERT) security incident has happened on 20 September 2020 after 3 patients 
enrolled. The recruitment has been paused until full system restoration on 1st October 2020. There were 
no protocol deviations attributed to the incident or the management of the incident. 
Conduct of the study 
An amendment to protocol was approved on 18 November 2020. Key changes to the protocol are 
summarised below: 
- The definition of target joint bleeds was clarified to include unresolved target joints: a target joint that 
does not fulfil the criterion of ≤ 2 bleeds into this joint within a consecutive 12-month period. 
- Wording was corrected for consistency to state that the primary analysis will be conducted after 50 
patients (not all patients) with moderate hemophilia A have completed 52 weeks of emicizumab 
treatment, are lost to follow-up, or have withdrawn, whichever occurs first 
- Clarification was added to state that a mobile nurse may administer emicizumab or perform other 
assessments during home visits if necessary. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 48 patients (67.6%) had 117 major protocol deviations. The deviations were most frequently 
related to activity monitor assessment with ≥3 days missing (n=28), absent BMQ data recorded on 
handheld device for > 2 consecutive weeks (n=15) and missing entire scheduled hematology and blood 
chemistry lab panels (n=14), missing HJHS and plasma samples not collected within the 48h of the initial 
FVIII given for bleed (n=6 each). 12 patients had 18 major protocol deviations due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Patients with missing BMQ records were interviewed by the investigator (or designee) for 
retrospective reporting of bleeding events and none of the reported major protocol deviations affected the 
evaluation of patient safety or efficacy. 
No deviations led to exclusion of data from the analysis.

Table 4 Summary of Demographic Characteristics (Treated Population) 
Baseline Haemophilia A Disease and Haemophilia A Treatment Characteristics 
51 patients (71.8%) had moderate HA and 20 patients (28.2%) had mild HA without inhibitors. 
At study entry, 37 patients (52.1%) were on prophylactic treatment and 34 patients (47.9%) were on 
episodic treatment. The primary reasons investigators considered prophylaxis warranted for patients was 
a history of frequent bleeds (39/71, 54.9%), and/or history of frequent joint bleeds (32/71, 45.1%), 
and/or history of severe bleeding (15/71, 21.1%), and/or prevention of traumatic bleeds (9/71, 12.7%) 
and other (5/71, 7.0%). Two female patients were menarchal and had menstrual bleed history. Neither 
had heavy bleeding patterns but one had moderate flow and bleeding duration of 8-13 days.  
In the 24 weeks prior to enrolment, the median number of bleeds was 2.0 (range: 0-60). The overall 
proportion of patients with target joints (defined as at least 3 bleeds into the same joint over 24 weeks, 
or an unresolved target joint) was 33.8%. Target joints most frequently included the knee and ankle. 38 
treated patients (53.5%) received prophylactic FVIII treatment (57.9% of patients were using FVIII short 
acting and 42.1% were using FVIII long acting) and 34 patients (46.5%) received episodic FVIII 
treatment (87.2% receiving FVIII and 15.4% receiving FVIII long acting).

Table 6 Summary of Bleeding Events in the Last 24 Weeks Prior to Study Entry (Treated 
Population) 
Prior disease other than Haemophilia A 
The majority of the enrolled patients (71.8%) reported at least one baseline medical condition other than 
HA. The most frequently reported disorders were haemophilic arthropathy (11.3%), hypertension (9.9%), 
arthropathy (8.5%), seasonal allergy (7.0%), headache (7.0%), and pain (7%).  
Surgeries and Procedures  
A total of 43 patients (60.6%) reported surgeries and procedures prior to participating in the study. There 
was not a specific type of surgery/procedure that was commonly reported across patients as each 
surgery/procedure type was reported in ≤2 patients each. 
Previous and concomitant treatments  
Concerning the concomitant Haemophilia A treatments, the most frequently used class was 
antihemorrhagics (FVIII) reported in 8 (11.3%) patients.  
Regarding non-haemophilia A treatment, the majority of patients (57.7%) were receiving at least one 
treatment at baseline. The most common treatment (i.e., received by > 10% patients) were analgesics, 
reported for 14 (19.7%) patients. 
Numbers analysed 
At the CCOD for this interim CSR, 71 patients started study treatment, a total of 59 (83.1%) patients 
completed at least 24 weeks in the efficacy period (10 with mild HA and 49 with moderate HA).

Outcomes and estimation 
Table 7 Observation time (Treated Population) 
The efficacy period was defined as the number of days starting from the fist emicizumab dose to the day 
of CCOD or withdrawal from the study whichever is earlier. The median efficacy period duration was 
27.57 weeks for all treated patients, 23.86 weeks for patients with mild HA, and 30.29 weeks for patients 
with moderate HA. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: treated bleeds 
“Treated bleeds” was defined as bleed followed by “treatment for bleed”, bleeds due to surgery/procedure 
are excluded. The negative binomial regression model-based ABR for treated bleeds was 0.8 (95% CI: 
0.41, 1.46). The calculated mean ABR (0.7 [95% CI: 0.01, 5.13]) was consistent with the model based 
ABR. The median ABR was 0 (IQR: 0.0-0.00) 
68 patients (95.8%) had 0-3 treated bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis including 57 patients 
(80.3%) experienced zero treated bleeds. 
Secondary Bleed-Related Endpoints 
All Bleeds 
“All bleeds” included both treated and non-treated bleeds, bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded. 
The NB regression model-based ABR “All bleeds” (those treated and untreated with coagulation factors) 
was 2.3 (95% CI: 1.63, 3.10). The calculated mean ABR (2.2 [95% CI: 0.31, 7.53]) was consistent with 
the model-based ABR. The median ABR was 1.5 (IQR: 0.00-3.79).  
62 patients (87.3%) experienced 0-3 all bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis including 33 
patients (46.5%) experienced zero all bleeds. Among all treated patients, 14 patients had >2 all bleeds 
(5 patients with 3 bleeds, 6 patients with 4 bleeds, 1 patient with 5 bleeds, 1 patient with 8 bleeds, and 1 
patient with 10 bleeds). All 3 patients with >4 bleeds had moderate HA.  
Treated Joint Bleeds 
The NB regression model-based ABR for treated joint bleeds was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.65). The 
calculated mean ABR (0.3 [95% CI: 0.00, 4.24]) was consistent with the model-based ABR. The median 
ABR was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00-0.00).  
70 patients (98.6%) experienced 0-3 treated joint bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis 
including 64 patients (90.1%) had zero treated joint bleeds, 5 patients had 1 treated joint bleed, 1 
patient had 2 treated joint bleeds. Only 1 patient experienced 4 treated joint bleeds, of which 1 was a 
target joint site (right hip). This patient has frequent joint bleeding recorded in the hemophilia history 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 36/92 
 
 
 
 
 
with 9 joint bleeds experienced in the 24 weeks prior to study entry (4 spontaneous and 5 traumatic). All 
reported treated joint bleeds were traumatic (11 out of 11 bleeds). 
Treated Spontaneous Bleeds 
The NB regression model-based ABR for treated spontaneous bleeds was 0.1 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.23). The 
calculated mean ABR (0.1 [95% CI: 0.00, 3.82]) was consistent with the model-based ABR. The median 
ABR was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00-0.00). 68 patients (95.8%) experienced zero treated spontaneous bleeds while 
receiving emicizumab prophylaxis was 95.8% (68 patients). Overall, 3 patients experienced 1 
spontaneous treated bleed. The site location of these bleeds was categorized as “Other” (i.e., not joint or 
muscle).  
Treated Target Joint Bleeds 
The NB regression model-based ABR for treated target joint bleeds (including unresolved target joints) 
did not converge due to a low number of bleeds with short follow-up times. The calculated mean ABR was 
0.1 (95% CI: 0.00, 3.93). The median ABR was 0.00 (IQR: 0.00-0.00). 67 patients (94.4%) experienced 
zero treated target joint bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. 4 patients had 1 treated target 
joint bleed. One patient experienced a traumatic joint bleed during loading phase of emicizumab, through 
which this joint newly met conservative criteria of target joint (i.e., ≥3 joint bleeds, including traumatic 
bleeds, within a 6-month period), otherwise no patients experienced joint bleeds by which criteria of 
target joint would have been met.

Exploratory Bleed-Related Endpoints 
Bleeds by location and type 
Treated bleeds occurred most frequently in the joints (48.5%, 16/33 bleeds) and in other locations (i.e, 
not joint or muscle) (45.5%, 15/33 bleeds). Only a minority of treated bleeds occurred in the muscles 
(6.1%, 2/33). Treated bleeds most frequently occurred in the knee (other bleed; 5/33 bleeds), ankle 
(joint bleed, 4/33 bleeds), and knee (joint bleed, 4/33 bleeds). 
Bleeds by cause 
For treated bleeds, 90.9% (30 of 33 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds while the rest 9.1% (3/33 bleeds), 
were spontaneous bleeds (excluding bleeds due to surgery/procedure).  
For all bleeds (irrespective of the 72-hour rule and including bleeds due to surgery/procedure), 67.9% 
(74/109 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds, 22.9% (25/109 bleeds) were spontaneous bleeds, and 9.2% 
(10/109 bleeds) were due to surgery/procedure.

Symptoms of joint bleeds 
Bleed-associated symptoms were collected for muscle and joint bleeds in patients 12 years and older. 
There were 28 joint bleeds. The most common symptoms of treated joint bleeds were increased pain 
(39.3%, 11/28 bleeds), decreased range of motion/difficulty using arm or leg compared to baseline 
(35.7%, 10/28 bleeds), and increased swelling/warmth of the skin (17.9%, 5/28 bleeds). 
The most common symptoms of all bleeds in a joint were increased pain (50.0%, 14/28 bleeds), 
decreased range of motion/difficulty using arm or leg compared to baseline (46.4%, 13/28 bleeds), and 
increased swelling/warmth of the skin (32.1%, 9/28 bleeds). 
All bleeds irrespective of the 72-hour rule and including bleeds due to surgery/procedure 
A total of 109 bleeds irrespective of the 72-hour rule and including bleeds due to surgery/procedure were 
reported. They occurred most frequently (70.6%, 77/109 bleeds) in locations other than joints or muscle 
in 28 patients. All bleeds occurred predominantly in the nose (17/109 bleeds), fingers/thumb (other; 
11/109 bleeds), and mouth (11/109 bleeds). The number of patients who experienced joint bleeds and 
muscle bleeds is 15 and 4 respectively. 
Post-hoc analysis of ABR for All bleeds 
Table 10 Median ABR Prior to Study versus ABR at Week 25 (All Bleeds) by Subgroup 
Post-hoc analysis showed that the ABR for All Bleeds was numerically reduced from an estimated 4.3 
(0.0-8.7) median calculated ABR prior to study entry to an ABR of 1.5 (0.0-3.4) in the study, irrespective 
of haemophilia severity or previous use of episodic or prophylactic FVIII. 13 patients had an increase in 
their ABR during emicizumab treatment compared to estimated ABR prior to study entry. Most of these 
bleeds were traumatic or procedure/surgery-related and without treatment. Spontaneous bleeds (n=7) 
were mostly nosebleeds (n=4). One patient recorded one spontaneous treated bleed. 20 patients had 
stable ABR and 38 patients had a decrease in ABR during emicizumab treatment. 7 of the 38 patients 
with a decrease in ABR during emicizumab treatment had a major decrease to an ABR <1 compared to an 
estimated ABR >10 prior study entry. This occurred more frequently in patients on prior episodic 
treatment (n=5) and was observed both in patients with mild (n=3) and moderate (n=4) HA. 
Of the 24 patients (33.8%, including 6 patients with mild HA) who presented target joint bleeds 
(including unresolved target joints) prior to treatment start, 7 had bleeds in their target joints and of 
those 4 required additional treatment for target joint bleeds during the efficacy period.

Secondary Health-Related Quality of Life and Health Status Endpoints 
CATCH Questionnaire (Weeks 1, 13, and 25) 
Comprehensive Assessment Tool of Challenges in Hemophilia (CATCH) questionnaire was used to assess 
the benefit of emicizumab therapy.  
Adult patients: By Week 25, there were few changes from baseline in most of the CATCH domains, with 
the exception of Treatment Burden which had a mean (SD) 15.25-point (21.41) improvement. 
Pediatric patients (<18 years): By Week 25, there were few changes from baseline in most of the 
domains, with the exception of Treatment Burden which showed a mean (SD) 22.17-point (26.74) 
increase (indicating lower perceived treatment burden of hemophilia) as well as a reduction in 
Recreational Activity risk perception (mean [SD] change of -10.27 [24.60] from baseline; however given 
the interquartile range, it should be interpreted with caution). A smaller change in Social Activity risk 
perception was also observed (mean [SD] change of -6.72 [13.71] from baseline). 
Caregivers: CATCH assessments included only domains for preoccupation and treatment burden. Given 
the small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. For both domains, a decrease in raw 
score was observed at Week 25 compared with baseline (Table 26), indicating an improvement in 
preoccupation related to hemophilia (mean [SD] change of -12.24 [7.91] from baseline) and a reduced 
perceived burden of hemophilia treatment (mean [SD] change of -14.29 [10.63] from baseline).  
Treatment burden demonstrated improvement in both the treated adult and pediatric population. Among 
caregivers, the treatment burden and preoccupation domains of the CATCH indicated an improvement, 
but given the sample size these trends should be interpreted with caution.

Emicizumab Preference Survey (EmiPref at Week 17) 
Based on the EmiPref, 96.0% of patients (48 of 50 patients) preferred SC emicizumab over their former 
IV hemophilia treatment and the results were aligned across almost all adolescent, adults, and 
caregivers. The most frequently reported reasons for this preference were “route of administration was 
easier” (27.1%), “frequency of treatment was lower” (20.8%), and “administration was easier” (16.7%). 
Joint Health (Hemophilia Joint Health Survey HJHS at week 25) 
For HJHS, a higher score indicates worse joint health. Clinically relevant improvements are defined as a 
≥4-point reduction in Total HJHS or a ≥2-point reduction in HJHS joints domain. At Week 25, a trend 
toward improvement in joint health from baseline to Week 25 was observed in HAVEN 6 among the 48 
patients who had scores. The mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 25 in HJHS total score was -1.58 
(3.17). The change from baseline to Week 25 for Calculated Sum of Joint Totals was -1.77 (2.94).  
Physical Activity 
Overall, the daily step count (DSC) was stable among treated patients between baseline (5922 median 
DSC) and Week 25 (6117 median DSC). A stable trend was also observed for the time spent by the 
treated patients in moderate to vigorous physical activity at baseline and at Week 25. The mean change 
(SD) from baseline to Week 25 in moderate physical activity was 5 (43) minutes (12.5% [42.8%]) and in 
vigorous physical activity was -3 (14) minutes (7.7% [66.2%]).  
Menstruation Heaviness and Menstruation-Related Quality of Life (MBQ Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire 
and PBAC Menstruation Diary with the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart) 
Health Status: EQ-5D-5L 
EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale Results at Week 25: The VAS is scored on a scale of 0-100. Higher scores 
are reflective of better health status. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L VAS score at baseline was high at 76.27 
(18.99). At Week 25, the score was 80.49 (16.39), representing a mean change from baseline of 3.43 
(10.03). 
EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score at Week 25: The EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score is scored on a scale of 0-1. 
Higher scores are indicative of better health status. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L Index Utility score at 
baseline was high at 0.79 (0.21). At Week 25, the score was 0.80 (0.22). 
Concomitant treatments for hemophilia A during the study 
A total of 35 patients (49.3%) received a non-emicizumab hemophilia medication during the study, all of 
which were FVIII. Of these 35 patients, 15 patients were allowed to continue their hemophilia treatments 
up to the 2nd loading dose of emicizumab to ensure adequate bleed control until effective emicizumab 
levels were achieved; and 20 patients received a non-emicizumab hemophilia medication after their 2nd 
loading dose of emicizumab. 18 of whom used FVIII as treatment for a bleed, 7 of whom used FVIII as 
preventative for surgery/procedure, and 1 who used FVIII as preventative before activity.

Table 12 Non-emicizumab Hemophilia Medication (Treated Population), post 2nd Emicizumab 
Dose 
The majority of bleeds (n = 29) were treated with short-acting FVIII. The median cumulative dose per 
bleed was 58.48 units/kg (range: 21.7-902.7), and the duration of treatment was 1 day for the majority 
(16 bleeds, 55.2%).  
4 patients (all enrolled at one study site) had received higher amounts of short-acting FVIII treatment 
that constitute the upper quartile of cumulative dose of short-acting FVIII administered per bleed. Those 
patients were males with moderate hemophilia A and ages of 12-19 years. Duration of FVIII for treatment 
varied from 3-16 days and was administered for traumatic, spontaneous, as well as procedure-related 
bleeds. The highest cumulative doses of short-acting FVIII were administered in a 13-year-old male, who 
received 16 days of FVIII for a spontaneous bleed.  
No other hemophilia treatments (e.g., recombinant FVIIa, PCC, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, or 
DDAVP) were used to treat bleeds in the study.

Concomitant Medications for Conditions Other than Hemophilia A 
The majority of patients (70.4%) received at least one concomitant treatment after baseline. The most 
common treatments (i.e., received by > 20% patients) were reported in the following classes: analgesics 
(26.8% of patients), other dermatological preparations (25.4% of patients), stomatological preparations 
(25.4% of patients) and vaccines (21.1% of patients). 
Surgeries and Procedures 
20 patients (28.2%) reported surgeries (n=12) and/or procedures (n=8) during the study. 
2 of 12 patients had 2 major surgeries (i.e. 1 circumcision and 1 inguinal hernia repair), both were 
managed with prophylactic hemophilia treatment, 1 of which also required treatment for a post-operative 
bleed.  
Another 10 patients had 19 minor surgeries including 11 dental surgeries, 1 central venous access device 
removal, 1 endoscopic procedure, 3 joint surgeries (synoviorthesis), 1 continuous glucose monitor 
removal and 1 cryotherapy. 12 (63.2%) minor surgeries were managed with prophylactic hemophilia 
treatment, 3 of which also required treatment of postoperative bleeds. 
All patients who received prophylactic medication for surgery/procedures or treatment for a post-surgical 
bleed received FVIII (either long or short acting).

Supportive studies 
Phase III Clinical Trials HAVEN 1 to HAVEN 4: Bleed-Related Efficacy Endpoints 
The efficacy of emicizumab in patients with HA (with and without FVIII inhibitors) has been evaluated in 
four prior pivotal HAVEN Phase III studies, namely, BH29884 (HAVEN 1), BH29992 (HAVEN 2), BH30071 
(HAVEN 3), and BO39182 (HAVEN 4). Please see Table 1 in this AR for study design.  
Data from prior experience with emicizumab have shown the following: 
• BH29884 (HAVEN 1, HA patients with inhibitors against FVIII, QW regimen): An 87% risk reduction in 
treated bleeds ABR (model based) compared with no prophylaxis and an 80% risk reduction for all bleeds 
ABR were observed. Additionally, intra-individual comparisons demonstrated risk reductions of 89% and 
77% for all bleeds ABR compared with prior episodic BPAs and prior prophylactic BPAs, respectively. The 
mean calculated ABR for treated bleeds (4.7) at the time of the primary CSR analysis improved further 
over time and the improvement was sustained beyond Week 48, whereas the median remained at 0. 
Overall, all three dosing regimens (loading doses of 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks followed by either 1.5 
mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W), using an equivalent cumulative dose, provided outstanding 
efficacy in children, adolescents and adults with ≥55% of patients in all emicizumab treatment arms 
experiencing zero treated bleeds and more than 90% of patients on emicizumab prophylaxis experiencing 
only 0-3 treated bleeds. 
Intra-individual comparison in Study BH29884 (HAVEN 1) demonstrated risk reductions of 95% and 88% 
for all bleeds ABR compared to prior episodic Bypassing agents (BPAs) and prior prophylactic BPAs, 
respectively. Intra-individual comparison (QW, n=18) in Study BH29992 (HAVEN 2) showed a reduction 
of 99% in the bleed rate for emicizumab prophylaxis compared with previous prophylactic/episodic 
treatment with the BPA. And similarly, in the Study BH30071 (HAVEN 3) study intra-individual 
comparison did show a 68% risk reduction of ABR in the emicizumab QW treated participants compared 
to prior FVIII prophylaxis. 
Bleed related endpoints are the primary and main secondary efficacy endpoints in the HAVEN Phase III 
studies. These studies used similar methodology to collect information about bleeds and their treatment, 
and applied uniform definitions and analysis.  
Table 15 shows a brief comparison of the primary analysis data from HAVEN 1 – HAVEN 4 Studies for 
treated bleeds and all bleeds efficacy endpoints.

Real World Data Studies 
Data from the TSUBASA and ADELPHI studies are provided as supportive efficacy information. 
TSUBASA 
The TSUBASA study is an ongoing, prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in Japan that 
aims to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and bleeding, the quality and content of daily 
life, and the safety of emicizumab in patients with HA without FVIII inhibitors. At the interim analysis with 
data cut-off of 31 May 2021, 107 patients were enrolled (91 patients with severe disease and 15 with 
moderate disease). Preliminary analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of emicizumab in patients with 
moderate HA, with bleed outcomes in line with the results of the BO41423 (HAVEN 6) study (calculated 
mean ABR [SD] in the 15 patients with moderate HA: 0.86±3.41).  
ADELPHI 
The ADELPHI study was a research survey of U.S. physicians treating patients with mild to moderate HA. 
The main objective of this analysis was to understand the change in ABR in patients with mild to 
moderate HA after 12 months of treatment with emicizumab. The study described the potential 
improvements in ABR in a small cohort of patients (5 patients with mild and 9 patients with moderate 
HA): the mean ABR (SD) for all bleeds in the 9 patients with mild or moderate disease that were followed 
up for at least 12 months was 0.7±0.71.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application includes data from the new Phase III Study BO41423 (HAVEN 6), which was designed to 
provide clinical safety and efficacy evidence to support the extension of indication to include adult and 
paediatric patients of all ages with mild and moderate HA without inhibitors to FVIII that warrant 
prophylactic treatment. 
Study design 
To support this variation, a single-arm, open label, ongoing, multicentre pivotal study was submitted. The 
main limitations of this pivotal study are the retrospective design and the lack of comparator (comparison 
of on-study data versus retrospectively recalled baseline data). The primary focus of this study was 
safety. Primary efficacy endpoint was the number of treated bleeds over time (ABR) with the 
implementation of 72-hour rule and the exclusion of bleeds due to surgery/procedure only for on-study 
ABR. 
Statistical methodology 
The pivotal trial is a single arm open-label study. The absence of a control group is a clear limitation to 
the interpretation of the study data. The overall sample size was based on feasibility without further 
statistical considerations. 
The sample size and timing for this specific interim analyses (IA) were not defined in the study protocol, 
and potential additional IAs were left undefined.  
All efficacy analyses are of descriptive nature in this study. There is no formal hypothesis testing (and 
therefore no multiplicity adjustment either), so that all analyses should be viewed as exploratory.  
The ABR calculations based on a negative binomial model are deemed appropriate. Regarding ABR 
descriptive statistics (based on the formula ABR = [n of bleeds/n of days during the efficacy period] × 
365.25), the MAH clarified the method used for deriving the 95% confidence interval around the 
calculated mean ABR, which is the exact Poisson method. 
The number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks before study entry has been collected retrospectively. This 
raises a general concern of accuracy for the summary of baseline bleeds, and is a clear limitation to the 
interpretation of baseline bleeds in comparison with post-baseline data. The MAH described that a 
haemophilia history extended eCRF page was implemented to provide additional details of all bleeds 
patients had during the last 24 weeks prior to enrolment. This page was generally completed with the 
exception of 2 participants. Although this provides some reassurance on the reliability of the retrospective 
collection, bias is still of concern due to the retrospective nature of pre-study data, and its comparability 
with post-baseline data remains doubtful. 
The 72-hour rule for combining bleeds of the same type and location was not initially applied to the 24-
week period prior to study entry. Similarly, the exclusions due to surgery/procedure were not applied to 
baseline bleed summaries. As requested, the MAH has conducted a sensitivity analysis where ABR 
statistics are derived for on-study ABR and prior study ABR, both with and without the 72 hour rule. 
According to the SAP, questions cannot be left unanswered in the BMQ. The fact that the entry system 
does not allow for missing or partial information had raised a concern of unreported bleeds in the study 
database. The MAH further clarified that several procedures were in place to optimise the completeness of 
data collection.

Without a control group the interpretation of any subgroup analyses remains challenging. In case of 
inconsistency, it may be difficult to differentiate between prognostic and predictive baseline factors. 
Study population 
HAVEN 6 enrolled patients with mild (FVIII > 5% and < 40%) and moderate HA (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) 
without FVIII inhibitors; who had been able to provide documentation of the details of prophylactic or 
episodic FVIII treatment and of number of bleeding episodes during the last 24 weeks prior to enrolment. 
Their “need for prophylaxis” at inclusion was only based on investigator’s individual assessment. The 
reason for which patients needed prophylaxis as well as treatment purpose was not defined. All patients 
either on prophylactic or on episodic FVIII treatment were eligible. The imprecision of these key criteria 
provided a highly heterogeneous population in this study. This further complicates the retrospective 
single arm study design with significant weakness making difficult to assess consistent efficacy across 
such heterogeneous population. It is regrettable that the relevant population advised of SAG has not been 
taken into account (i.e. “Moderate haemophilia A patients with FVIII levels equal to or less than 5%: • 
who had a first spontaneous intra-articular bleed before the age of 5 years or • who were already started 
on a prophylaxis regimen with a long-term prophylaxis intention”). Indeed, this advice is in line with the 
recommendation of the WFH i.e. “Prophylaxis is the standard of care for people with severe hemophilia, 
and for some people with moderate hemophilia, or for those with another congenital bleeding disorder 
that is associated with a severe bleeding phenotype and/or a high risk of spontaneous life-threatening 
bleeding”.  
The ad hoc expert group’s advice is also consistent with recently published experts’ opinion submitted by 
the MAH in response package (Valentino LA, Khair K, Prophylaxis for hemophilia A without inhibitors: 
treatment options and considerations. Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Jul;13(7):731-743, response to OC15). 
Experts highlight that early prophylaxis may also be appropriate for children with moderate haemophilia A 
who experience joint bleeding prior to age 5 years and have a more severe bleeding pattern. Indeed, as 
discussed by experts, hemarthrosis accounts for more than 90% of all serious bleeding events, this 
hallmark typically begins early in childhood and one paramount benefit of long-term prophylaxis is joint 
protection. Although the subcutaneous administration with long-effect of emicizumab is an undeniably 
appealing prophylactic option for haemophilia, a major challenge to the widespread use of emicizumab 
and other pro-coagulant therapies is a lack of data regarding the overlap between the therapeutic 
window, where bleeding is prevented, and the toxicity window, where the risk of thrombosis increases. 
Experts recommend also that large, multicentre studies are needed comparing ABR/AJBR in patients 
receiving FVIII versus emicizumab prophylaxis to justify the higher cost of this non factor therapy.  
HAVEN 6 was designed to be inclusive of the full spectrum of reasons why a patient with m/m HA without 
inhibitor warrants prophylaxis irrespective of their prior treatment (PUP or PTP, episodic or prophylactic). 
It is regrettable that the WFH recommendation as well as SAG and US experts’ opinion have not been 
taken into account, leading to a highly heterogeneous population in this study which makes assessment 
further difficult to extend beyond retrospective, exploratory and descriptive design of this single arm open 
pivotal study.  
Emicizumab treatment 
The emicizumab dosing regimen was 4 loading doses of emicizumab 3 mg/kg SC QW for 4 weeks followed 
by a maintenance dose of either 1.5 mg/kg SC QW, 3 mg/kg SC Q2W, or 6 mg/kg SC Q4W based on 
patient preference in this single-arm study. The chosen regimen needed to be maintained throughout the 
study until completion of at least 52W. Regular FVIII prophylaxis may continue until the 2nd emicizumab 
loading dose to avoid bleeds before adequate emicizumab levels are reached. For the treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds, FVIII should be used at the lowest dose expected to achieve haemostasis. Other 
drugs intended to control bleeds e.g., bypassing agents, DDAVP, or antifibrinolytics were permitted.

Study conduct 
The First Patient In is 10 February 2020. The cut-off date for analyses is 16 April 2021. The interim 
analysis was triggered after 50 patients with moderate HA without inhibitors had completed 24 weeks of 
emicizumab treatment. 
An update to the interim analysis has been provided in the evaluation. The clinical cut-off date of the 
primary analysis was 30 October 2021 resulting in a median emicizumab exposure of 54.29 weeks 
(range: 8.1- 89.1), which is more than double the median follow-up time of the interim analysis. Of note, 
the study continues after primary analysis. Overall, the results of this updated analysis of HAVEN 6 show 
that the safety and efficacy profile of emicizumab in patients with mild and moderate HA without FVIII 
inhibitors are consistent with data previously observed at interim analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
71 patients had started emicizumab in the study (treated population). A total of 59 treated patients had 
completed at least 24 weeks including 10 mild and 49 moderate HA without inhibitor patients. Patients 
were treated with emicizumab maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW (n=24), 3 mg/kg Q2W (n=39), and 6 
mg/kg Q4W (n=8).  
The median observation time was 27.57 weeks (range 6.7-61.7), 23.86 weeks for patients with mild HA, 
and 30.29 weeks for patients with moderate HA. 
A total of 117 major protocol deviations were reported in 48 of 71 patients (67.6%). All 48 patients had 
at least one procedural major deviation, 5 patients of them had medication deviations including use of a 
prohibited therapy in 3 patients. Such a high rate of procedural major procedural deviations may have an 
impact on the integrity of the study data and further hamper the study outcomes. The MAH clarified that 
paper BMQ as back-up to the handheld device were available to patients; in case of such a major protocol 
deviation, study sites were required to contact the patient in a timely manner and recorded bleeds on 
paper BMQ were entered by the site via data entry system. 
Baseline data 
The median age of treated population (n=71) was 23.0 years, no patient younger than 2 years of age 
was enrolled. The potentials of coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolysis in new-borns and infants 
clearly differ with those older children and adults. The PK exposure is also likely to be less than in 
subjects under 6 months than older children. The MAH provided the following evidence for the subgroup 
of young patients < 2 years of age.  
- 8 patients under the age of 2 years were in enrolled in prior studies of emicizumab, according to the 
MAH, the available data show consistent efficacy and safety between the < 2 year age group and older 
patients, no safety concerns have arisen in the post-marketing setting that are specific to the <2 year 
age group, the available real world data also support the consistently favourable benefit-risk profile 
across all ages and post-marketing safety data include data of subjects < 2 year age from countries 
where emicizumab is approved for patients with m/m HA without inhibitors. 
It should be noted that the available data of subjects under the age of 2 years were mostly obtained from 
patients with severe HA with or without inhibitors. The MAH provided an analysis by age category (<6 
months, 6-12 months, 12-24 months) all clinical data (PK, PD, efficacy and safety) from 8 subjects < 2 
years enrolled in prior studies of emicizumab, as well as post-marketing safety data of subjects < 2 years 
age with m/m HA; and compare to older patients setting.  
The MAH provided the requested analysis from HAVEN 2 for the 8 patients < 2 years with HA with FVIII 
inhibitors, a comparison to those > 2 years has also been made. Overall, efficacy, safety, PK and PD 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 52/92 
 
 
 
 
profiles in participants <2 years with HA with FVIII inhibitors were consistent with those observed in older 
patients. It is noted that the median age is 16 months (range 14-23 months) for 8 patients < 2 years. 
Thus, there was no patient <1 year in this study. A slightly higher emicizumab exposure was observed in 
0-2 years group than older age group. Although emicizumab is approved in the USA, Australia and Japan 
with no restrictions on age or disease severity, the Safety Database search retrieved 0 cases reporting 
post-marketing safety data from patients < 2 years of age with mild or moderate HA. 
- HAVEN 7 study (MO41787) is currently ongoing. This study, which evaluates the safety, efficacy, PK and 
PD of emicizumab in patients with severe HA without inhibitors who are less than 1 year old at study 
entry, was designed to provide additional data as suggested with the prior submission of the non-inhibitor 
extension of indication (EMEA/H/C/004406/II/0002). The MAH provided an interim data including the 
safety and efficacy endpoints as well as the available PK, PD, and immunogenicity results until CCOD (31 
March 2022) for 24 infants aged < 3 months and 30 infants aged from ≥ 3 months to ≤ 12 months at the 
time of enrolment. The mean age at enrolment of the participants was 5.1 months. The available interim 
data support the efficacy of emicizumab prophylaxis in infants with severe HA without FVIII inhibitors 
across all bleed related endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that previously observed in 
HAVEN studies, and there were no new safety signals. The interim PK analyses demonstrated sufficient 
levels of drug exposure while these analyses are limited by small numbers of samples in some of the 
subgroups. PD data showed a tendency of increased FVIII-like activity and thrombin generation with age. 
The MAH thought that this increase in pharmacodynamic markers (FVIII-like activity and thrombin 
generation) with age is most likely related to the age effect seen on FIX and FX antigen concentrations, 
aPTT remained fully normalised regardless of age. These data support the favourable efficacy and safety 
in subpopulation of patients < 1 years with severe HA without inhibitors. The ongoing HAVEN 7 study will 
continue to generate efficacy, safety, PK and PD data on the use of emicizumab in young patients with 
the final CSR expected in 2030 at the conclusion of a 7-year long term follow-up. 
- No m/m patient under 2 years of age were enrolled in HAVEN 6. As reported by French and US studies, 
the majority of moderate forms are diagnosed after 8-9 months and mild forms after 29-36 months. In 
contrast to the situation for severe HA where spontaneous bleeding with severe bleeding phenotype are 
frequent, few patients with m/m HA would be expected to start prophylaxis within the first 2 years of life.  
As discussed in the review “Spotlight on emicizumab in the management of hemophilia A: patient 
selection and special considerations, Koji et al, Journal of Blood Medicine 2019:10 171–181”, one of the 
biggest problems at an early stage after birth is how to avoid the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage 
(ICH). However, considering the PK of subcutaneous emicizumab, it might NOT be expected to exert a 
haemostatic effect immediately even if administered at an early stage after birth. After 1 or 2 years, 
bleeding frequency increases due to an increase in activity associated with normal growth and 
development of infants, trauma, and patients most often experience initial joint bleeding. Hence, in 
response to an increase in the bleeding risk, this stage is generally the time to introduce prophylactic 
replacement therapy. 
- The Pednet study (Kenet G et al. data cut January 2021) reports the bleed rates in patients under 2 
years of age with severe HA. ABR (95% CI) for all bleeds appears higher for children under 2 years of age 
2.34 (1.44;3.80) compared to the ABR for all bleeds 1.32 (0.99;1.77) in the full paediatric population. 
There were 32 children < 2 years of age out of 141 patients under 18 years of age. Median treatment 
duration (IQR) was 9.8 months (3.6-19.8) for all patients, 17.9 (7.9-28.1) for inhibitor patients and 3.7 
(2.3-9.3) for non-inhibitor patients reflecting the earlier adoption of emicizumab in inhibitor patients.  
In conclusion, there are limited clinical trial data on the use of emicizumab in patients under 2 years with 
severe HA, the data are missing in patients < 2 years with m/m HA without inhibitors. Prospective clinical 
data collection concurrent with the use of emicizumab in this age group (PK, PD including haemostasis

speed, efficacy and safety), through sponsored clinical trials and particularly in children < 6 months is 
strongly encouraged. Data should also be available from the registry studies (please see RMP). 
As a reminder, in 2018, the MAH had already sought the EOI including m/m HA without inhibitors for 
Hemlibra (EMEA/H/C/004406/II/0002). At the time, the SAG concluded that “the lack of data in children 
less than 1 year and the need to generate data in this group given that not only PK but also the 
coagulation system is likely to be different in the new born children was also raised”. 
The majority of the patients enrolled in this study had moderate HA without inhibitor (51/71, 71.8%) and 
20 patients (28.2%) had mild HA without inhibitor. At study entry, half of patients were on prophylactic 
treatment (n=37, 52.1%) all with FVIII, and 34 patients (47.9%) were on episodic treatment. 
A total number of 239 bleeds was retrospectively collected by 71 patients in the last 24W (median 2.0, 
range: 0-60). The majority of patients (51/71, 71.8%) experienced 0-3 bleeds including 22 patients with 
0 bleed.  
A total of 203 joint bleeds per year prior to study entry were recalled by 71 patients.  
It is noted one patient had experienced a total of 60 bleeds in the last 24 W and 120 joint bleeds per year 
prior to study entry while 0 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study.  
The number of bleeds recalled by patient varied greatly over time prior to study. For example, two 
patients collected 60 and 15 bleeds per year respectively while 0 bleeds in the last 24 week prior to 
study.  
The number of joint bleeds per year prior to study entry were missing or unknown for the majority of 
patients (76.1%, 54/71, cf Approved listing of hemophilia history: reason of warranting prophylaxis, all 
treated patients in CSR). However, “history of frequent joint bleeds” was the primary reasons of 
warranted prophylaxis for 32 patients (45.1%). The MAH clarified that such discrepancy is probably due 
to the eCRF design, requesting to provide the information in the field “Number of joint bleeds per year 
prior to study entry/Regular prophylaxis” only for participants indicating “History of frequent joint 
bleeding” as a reason to warrant prophylaxis. 
The major weakness of retrospective data is that they generate a great deal of missed data. The accuracy 
and completeness of these baseline data collected in a retrospective manner is questionable. 
Baseline data of FVIII activity are provided and reflect the residual endogenous FVIII activity and the use 
of FVIII prior to study entry in some patients. (Please see section Pharmacodynamics of this AR). 
Of 37 patients being on FVIII prophylaxis at baseline, 28 had moderate HA without inhibitors and 9 have 
minor disease. This prophylactic subpopulation seems very heterogeneous; and the reasons why patients 
warrant prophylaxis do not seem to consist with patient’s bleeding history. Indeed, a half of patients with 
minor disease (5 of 9) received FVIII prophylaxis prior to study, while they had not experienced any 
bleed in the last 24W. In contrast, half of patients (5/11) with minor disease received only episodic 
treatment, while they all had a history of severe bleeding and/or frequent (joint) bleeding in the last 
24W. This is not surprising since the protocol did not define any criterion regarding prophylaxis warranted 
at inclusion and patient’s selection was only based on investigator’s individual assessment “need for 
prophylaxis”.  
The need for prophylaxis depends on multiple factors (e.g. characteristics, age group, lifestyle, clinical 
conditions…). The analysis of the haemophilia history data from HAVEN 6 demonstrated the heterogeneity 
of reasons for warranting prophylaxis in the study participants with the most commonly reported reasons 
being history of frequent bleeding (56.3%), history of frequent joint bleeding (45.1%) and history of 
severe bleeding (21.1%). Additional subgroup analyses show the reasons for warranting prophylaxis were

similar for patients with mild or moderate HA, with some minor variations. However, the small sample 
size (n=5) of patients <18 years with mild HA limits interruption of this subgroup analysis. 
Bleed-related endpoints  
The primary (treated bleeds) and secondary efficacy analyses were based on the treated population, by 
excluding all bleeds due to surgery/ procedure and by implementing 72 hour-rule: 
Follow up for a median of 27.5 weeks, the interim results indicated that: 
- For treated bleeds, the NB regression model based ABR was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.46) and the 
calculated mean ABR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.01, 5.13]). The majority of patients experience 0 treated bleeds 
while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (80.3% 57 patients). 
- For all bleeds (those treated and untreated with coagulation factors, the model based ABR was 2.3 
(95% CI: 1.63, 3.10) and the calculated mean ABR was 2.2 (95% CI: 0.31, 7.53).  
A total of 38 (53.5%) patients experienced all bleeds during the study by excluding bleeds due to 
surgery/ procedure and by implementing 72 hour-rule. Indeed, development of neutralising anti 
emicizumab antibodies with decreasing emicizumab concentration leading to loss of efficacy has been 
observed during clinical trials. The pooled data submitted in ongoing variation EMEA/H/C/004406/II/0025 
showed that among 668 patients tested in 7 Phase III studies, 34 patients (5.1%) developed ADA, 88.2% 
detected within 6 months, 18 patients (2.7%) with neutralising antibodies and 4 patients with decreasing 
emicizumab concentrations/reduced PD effects. One post-marketing case of fatal intracranial 
haemorrhage, preceded by a presumptive loss of efficacy due to the development of ADAs, has also been 
reported.  
The MAH confirmed that none of these 38 participants tested positive for ADA, and no bleeding events 
(treated or all bleeds) were reported by the 2 participants who were identified as ADA positive; neither 
were events of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with ADA reported, at the cut-off for the 
primary analysis on 30 October 2021 resulting in a median emicizumab exposure of 54.29 weeks (range: 
8.1- 89.1), which is more than double the median follow-up time of the interim analysis. 
Furthermore, it seems that there is no available commercially validated assay specific for testing the 
antidrug antibody status with emicizumab. In case of increase in breakthrough bleeding events, evocative 
sign of loss of efficacy, evaluation is currently based on PK (decrease in emicizumab exposure) and 
clinical assessment; the treatment decision-making can only rely on the experience and practices of 
specialised centres. This raises a concern for accurate assessment of etiologic factors in case of increase 
in bleeding events. 
A total of 33 treated bleeds (primary endpoint) were reported in 14 (19.7%) of 71 patients; 90.9% (30 of 
33 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds while the rest 9.1% (3/33 bleeds) were spontaneous bleeds (excluding 
bleeds due to surgery/procedure). Treated bleeds occurred most frequently in the joints (48.5%, 16/33 
bleeds) reported in 7 patients (9.9%) including 4 (5.6%) patients with treated target joint bleeds.  
- For treated joint bleeds and for treated spontaneous bleeds, the model-based ABR for was 0.3 (95% CI: 
0.12, 0.65) and 0.1 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.23) respectively. 
- For treated target joint bleeds (including unresolved target joints), the model-based ABR did not 
converge due to a low number of bleeds with short follow-up times. The calculated mean ABR was 0.1 
(95% CI: 0.00, 3.93). 
Exploratory analyses by including bleeds due to surgery/procedure and irrespective of the 72-hour rule: a 
total of 109 bleeds occurred in 71 treated patients; 67.9% (74/109 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds, 22.9% 
(25/109 bleeds) were spontaneous bleeds, and 9.2% (10/109 bleeds) were due to surgery/procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 55/92 
 
 
 
 
Locations other than joints or muscle such as nose, mouth, and fingers/thumb represent 70.6% 77 of 109 
bleeds reported in 28 patients. 
Post-hoc analysis of ABR for All bleeds 
A post-hoc analysis was performed to compare ABR for All bleeds retrospectively collected by the patients 
in the 24 weeks prior to study entry (without implementation of 72h-rule nor exclusion of 
surgery/procedure related bleeds) with ABR collected during efficacy period of this study (by 
implementing both 72h-rule and exclusion of surgery/procedure related bleeds). This analysis showed 
that the median estimated ABR prior to study entry was 4.3 (0.0-8.7) and the median calculated ABR for 
All Bleeds (72h-rule) was 1.5 (0.0-3.4). 
A supplemental analysis was performed by the MAH to assess the potential bias in the retrospective 
collection of bleed data across previously submitted studies (HAVEN 1, 2, 3 and 4). The retrospective 
collection of bleeds in the eCRF (without the 72-hour rule) for patients who were not part of the Non-
Interventional Study (NIS) BH29768 (the “non-NIS group”) was compared to the prospective collection of 
bleeds (via the BMQ, and with the 72-hour rule) for patients in the NIS (the “NIS group”). Of note, this 
analysis was performed in patients with severe disease, such population may be notably different from 
that of m/m HA in terms of CRF collection manner, disease surveillance and management. Although the 
effort to assess bias between prospective and retrospective collection is appreciated, the comparability of 
the two patient subsets is questionable, and may in itself flaw the comparison. Bias cannot be excluded 
nor quantified based on these exploratory analyses. It is still of concern due to the retrospective nature of 
pre-study data, and the comparability between baseline and post-baseline data remains doubtful.  
In addition, it is noted that the model-based ABR in the patient group with a retrospective collection of 
bleeds (without 72 hr rule) is slightly higher than with the prospective collection (with 72 hr rule). This 
could imply, as suspected, some bias when comparing post-baseline data with 72-hour rule to 
retrospective baseline data without any rule, with retrospective ABR being possibly under-estimated. 
As requested, the MAH has conducted a sensitivity analysis where ABR statistics are derived for on-study 
ABR and prior study ABR, both with and without the 72 hour rule.  
It is noted (consistently with the above supplemental analysis), that ABR model-based estimates are 
slightly lower when applying the 72-hour rule, for on-study ABR as well as for prior study ABR. On-study 
ABR model-based estimates are numerically smaller than prior study ABR, and a larger proportion of 
patients with zero bleeds is observed for post-baseline bleeds, with or without the 72-hour rule being 
applied. Nevertheless, it is also noted that pre-study median ABR reduced from 4.3 to 2.2 when applying 
the 72-hour rule. While this may reflect the skewed distribution of ABR in a relatively small sample size, 
this is another indication of the additional bias introduced when ignoring the 72h rule. 
It is noted that at the approved dosing, emicizumab does not completely restore normal haemostasis in 
mild/moderate patients enrolled in this study and more than half of treated patients (38/71, 53.5%) still 
experience bleeds during the efficacy period. During emicizumab treatment, the ABR increased in 13 
patients compared to their pre-study estimated ABR, 20 patients with stable ABR and 38 patients with 
decreased ABR respectively. Of the 24 patients who presented target joint bleeds prior to study, 7 had 
bleeds in their target joints and of those 4 required additional treatment for target joint bleeds during the 
efficacy period. Most of these bleeds were traumatic and without treatment. 
There were some limitations with regards to the efficacy in joint bleed:  
- The number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks before study entry was based on historical information 
collected by patients. This raises a general concern of accuracy for baseline bleeds and is a clear 
limitation to the interpretation of baseline bleeds in comparison with post-baseline data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 56/92 
 
 
 
 
- All bleeds due to surgery and/or procedure were excluded for post-baseline data. However, all surgery 
or procedure related bleeds were not excluded from retrospective baseline data.  
- The baseline bleeding characteristics (treated or not, spontaneous or trauma/surgery related, location, 
severity…) were not collected, thus cannot be taken into account into analysis.  
- High ABR before enrolment seems driven by one patient who had experienced a total of 60 bleeds in the 
last 24 W before study entry. This patient experienced 0 on-study bleeds. The MAH clarified that this 
patient had history of joint bleeding, and due to haemophilic arthropathy of the left knee, he underwent 
total prosthesis replacement 210 Days prior to start of study treatment. All bleeds prior to study entry 
occurred in the left knee. The investigator considered improved bleed control on study being a result of 
emicizumab prophylaxis, however, the total prosthesis replacement on D210 prior to study entry could 
also contribute to 0 on-study bleeds reported in this patient. Of note, the MAH indicated that this Subject 
- had not used a bleed diary to list bleeding details and treatments prior to joining the study, his 
Haemophilia History Extended eCRF page was not completed, therefore we assume this subject was one 
of 2 subjects excluded from sensitivity analysis. 
- the inclusion in the emicizumab treated cohort was conditioned by previous data collection, only 
patients who had the capacity to provide “Documentation of the details of prophylactic or episodic FVIII 
treatment and of number of bleeding episodes for at least the last 24 weeks prior to enrolment” were 
enrolled. This may raise the question of representativeness especially for patients with mild disease 
whose daily lifestyle may have significant consequences to manage their disease.  
In conclusion, any before/after differences in this pivotal HAVEN 6 study need to be interpreted with 
extreme caution and no firm conclusions can be drawn from this post-hoc analysis in a single-arm open 
pivotal study with a retrospective design.  
ABR subgroup analysis  
Additional descriptive subgroup analysis of treated bleeds were computed on the basis of age (<65 vs. 
≥65 years, <18 vs. ≥18 years), haemophilia severity (mild vs. moderate), presence of target joints, 
previous treatment regimen (episodic vs. prophylactic), and dosing regimen at enrolment.  
For some subgroups (age<6 years, race, previous FVIII inhibitors, female patients), the number of 
patients was too small to adequately evaluate ABR.  
Due to the small sample size, the descriptive and exploratory nature of this study, subgroups analyses 
should be interpreted with caution. No conclusion can be drawn from these analyses. 
Secondary health-related QoL and health status endpoints 
HAVEN 6 assessed the benefit of emicizumab on health-related QoL by using CATCH questionnaire, the 
emicizumab patient preference questionnaire, the HJHS for joint health, an accelerometer for physical 
activity, menstruation-related quality of life information and EQ-5D-5L for health status.  
The results seem to reflect improved aspects of patient health-related QoL and caregiver burden, as 
demonstrated in prior HAVEN studies. But given the sample size and the study design, these trends 
should be interpreted with caution. No conclusions can be drawn. 
Concomitant treatments for haemophilia A during the study 
A total of 35 patients (49.3%) received a FVIII medication during the study. Of these 35 patients, 20 
patients received a FVIII after their 2nd loading dose of emicizumab. 18 of whom used FVIII as treatment 
for a bleed, 7 of whom used FVIII as preventative for surgery/procedure, and 1 who used FVIII as 
preventative before activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 57/92 
 
 
 
 
15 of 71 patients continued their FVIII prophylaxis up to the 2nd emicizumab loading dose to avoid 
bleeds before adequate emicizumab levels are reached, this is understood. Although the concomitant use 
of FVIII and emicizumab was of short duration, this confounding factor could affect the efficacy endpoints 
in the analysis in this single-arm study and further hampers the interpretation of efficacy outcomes.  
The MAH clarified that due to design of BMQ option and since regular prophylaxis other than emicizumab 
is not permitted on study beyond the second loading dose, participants were advised to select 
“Preventative dose before activity” in the BMQ instead of “prophylaxis” for continued prophylaxis up to 
the second loading dose. A total of 22 subjects were identified who continued their FVIII prophylaxis in 
the first week of emicizumab loading doses, 6 of them reported 8 bleed events in the 1st week of 
emicizumab treatment and received FVIII in addition as treatment for bleeds. The treated bleeds and all 
bleeds model based ABR for the 22 participants who continued prophylaxis during the first week on study 
was 0.7 (0.26, 1.68) and 2.1 (1.37, 3.13) respectively. The proportion of participants who experienced 
zero all bleeds during the efficacy period was 36.4% (8 out of 22 participants), which is slightly lower 
than observed in the overall study population (46.5%), reflecting the possible higher risk bleeding 
phenotype in this subset patients who continued FVIII prophylaxis until the second loading dose being 
selected.  
5 patients had medication deviations including use of a prohibited therapy in 3 patients. Overall 
compliance with expected dosing of emicizumab was high in the study (93%, 66 of 71) and the limited 
number of these medication deviations is not considered to have a meaningful impact on the overall 
results and conclusions of the efficacy analysis. 
Per protocol, other drugs intended to control bleeds e.g., bypassing agents, DDAVP, or antifibrinolytics 
were permitted. The MAH confirmed that no participants received these drugs on a routine or regular 
basis during the study. Treatment with antifibrinolytic agent (tranexamic acid) was reported for 11 
participants (15.5%) as concomitant therapy in a total of 20 episodes. Overall, the generally limited 
duration of treatment with tranexamic acid is not expected to impact results of ABR significantly. 
The majority of bleeds (n=29) were treated with short-acting FVIII. The median cumulative dose per 
bleed was 58.48 units/kg (range: 21.7-902.7) and the median number of doses administered was 3.0 
(range: 1-44). This median cumulative dose of short-acting FVIII per bleed administered in HAVEN 6 is 
numerically higher than that used in patients with severe HA without inhibitor in HAVEN 3 (Arm A: 37 
unit/kg, Arm B: 27 unit/kg, and Arm D: 46 units/kg with patients who had received FVIII prophylaxis 
prior to study entry) as well as in HAVEN 4 expansion cohort (25.32 units/kg). The MAH states that such 
high use of FVIII products in HAVEN 6 was driven by 4 patients who had received higher amounts of 
short-acting FVIII treatment (cumulative dose >150 units/kg; 27.6%).  
Here again, the limitations due to small sample size, high variability, potential confounding factors and 
biases in estimation of bleeding number, making impossible to draw any conclusion.  
Surgeries and Procedures 
During the study, 12 patients reported a total of 19 minor and 2 major surgeries. Both major surgeries 
(i.e. 1 circumcision and 1 inguinal hernia repair) were managed with prophylactic FVIII treatment, 1 of 
which also required FVIII for a post-operative bleed. 19 minor surgeries were mostly dental surgeries 
(11/19). 63.2% of minor surgeries (12/19) were managed with FVIII prophylaxis, 3 of which also 
required FVIII for postoperative bleeds 
Overall, under the haemostatic coverage of emicizumab alone in mild and moderate HA, all major 
surgeries still required FVIII prophylaxis and FVIII for post-operative bleeds in 1 of 2 patients. Almost 
two-third of minor surgeries were managed with FVIII prophylaxis including 3 postoperative bleeds 
managed by FVIII.

The MAH analysed surgeries/procedure related bleeds data by separating patients with mild HA and those 
with moderate HA. At cut-off of the interim analysis (based on snapshot of data performed on 20th 
December 2021) for HAVEN 6, 13 patients reported 22 surgeries: 2 of 20 patients with mild HA had 1 
surgery each (1 minor and 1 major surgery), and 11 of 51 patients with moderate HA had a total of 20 
surgeries (1 major and 19 minor surgeries). Overall, only two surgeries were performed in patients with 
mild HA, 1 tooth extraction resulted in a related bleed. For patients with moderate HA, 6 procedures 
/surgeries are reported with related bleeding events directly following surgery. The small size makes any 
comparison difficult.  
Supportive studies 
The main results of prior HAVEN 1– HAVEN 4 studies have been presented as supportive data.  
It must however be acknowledged that: 
- the population is different in HAVEN 6 from those HAVEN studies,  
- in HAVEN 6, prior study entry ABR was estimated based on a retrospective collection of historic 
information recalled by patients, the comparator group is lacking. 
- HAVEN 6 is a descriptive and exploratory single-arm study in contrast to prior randomised controlled 
HAVEN studies, the analyses in HAVEN 6 are based on before and after entry study. The reliability of this 
comparison is questionable.  
The ongoing Japan observational TSUBASA study and US research survey ADELPHI study are not 
considered as sufficiently relevant for supporting this extension of indication. 
Overall, the efficacy results observed in severe HA in previous HAVEN studies cannot be easily 
extrapolated to patients with higher levels of FVIII regardless of the patient’s haemophilia severity or 
inhibitor status, as considered by the ad hoc expert group. 
Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 22nd September 2022 and were asked to respond to 
the following efficacy question as agreed by CHMP: 
1. Considering that emicizumab has now been used for several years since its approval, is 
there a clinical need for Hemlibra in the management of patients with mild or moderate 
congenital haemophilia A without inhibitors to FVIII and what is that need? 
The expert group described the current clinical practice, which is based on a broad agreement on the 
medical need for prophylaxis in patients with severe (<1 IU/dL FVIII activity) and moderate haemophilia 
A (1–5 IU/dL activity), across all age groups.  
The expert group also agreed that in patients with mild haemophilia (> 5 IU/dL– ≤ 40 IU/dL activity), 
generally, the need for prophylaxis is less clear. However, the expert group recognised that this is not a 
homogenous group and among mild haemophilia patients there is a small subset of patients for whom 
there might be a medical need for prophylaxis. Unfortunately, there are no robust data to predict 
precisely who will most benefit from prophylaxis, apart from those quite rare patients with mild 
haemophilia who manifest a severe bleeding phenotype. Indeed, as per the current guidelines in mild 
hemophilia A, the treating physician should decide to initiate a regular prophylaxis program after the 
occurrence of one or more bleeding episodes for which substitutive treatment with factor VIII concentrate 
was deemed necessary (see WFH Guidelines for the Management of Hemophilia, 2020).    
The expert group agreed that clinical decisions and guidelines about the need for prophylaxis likely 
consider factors like: level of factor VIII activity, with some data in the literature indicating that an 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 59/92 
 
 
 
 
activity between 5 IU/dL and 15 IU/dL might be associated with higher risk of bleeding; history of 
bleeding; practicing sports with high risk of injury (like football) in some patients. The expert group 
debated if mucosal bleeding (menorrhagia) in women could be considered as an additional risk factor. No 
clear conclusion was reached, considering that mucosal bleeding is not clearly related to actual FVIII level 
and also to the availability of other options such as DDAVP during menses. However, the expert group 
recognized that this is an area in need of further research in the context of the great impact that women’s 
issues might have in women with haemophilia and haemophilia carriers.  
Concerning the choice of prophylaxis treatment, it will be important to consider the harms of different 
treatment options and any potential risks. In this context, Hemlibra is an additional treatment option for 
prophylaxis that offers advantages in terms of ease of administration, and consequently, quality of life, in 
patients with severe and moderate haemophilia. The benefits in prophylaxis for moderate haemophila 
clearly outweigh the risks given the morbidity and mortality associated with bleedings in this population.  
However, in the rare subset of patients with mild haemophilia for whom prophylaxis is clinically indicated, 
one needs to consider not only the need for prophylaxis but also the known harms and potential risks 
associated with the product. Unfortunately, given the available data, including from study HAVEN 6, it is 
difficult to exclude potential thromboembolic risks on the basis of a small database in these patients and 
pharmacological considerations. Therefore, these potential risks need to be taken into account in 
individual benefit-risk decisions, and further data should be collected as part of pharmacovigilance efforts 
to minimise the uncertainties about these risks.  
While considering that this small subset of mild haemophilia patients should not be deprived of Hemlibra 
as prophylaxis option, the expert group also expressed concerns that this should not lead to 
indiscriminate use of prophylaxis treatment in mild haemophilia, which would result in unnecessary 
burden for the patients, and worse, could expose patients to the risk of important side-effects. Therefore, 
there should be clear information for prescribers to carefully consider the need of prophylaxis in mild 
haemophilia patients and, when considering different options, to balance any potential benefits against 
the harms and risks of treatment, including the uncertainties about the risk of thrombosis with 
emicizumab, given the small safety database. 
2. Based on the data submitted (i.e. HAVEN 6 clinical study and extrapolation data) to support 
the extension of indication of Hemlibra in the management of patients with mild or moderate 
congenital haemophilia A without inhibitors to FVIII; are the data submitted by the company 
adequate to address the use in this wider patients population? 
See above. The expert group strongly recommended that safety and efficacy data collection post-
marketing in the form of registries and cohorts should be considered especially for the mild haemophilia 
population and in children <2 years old. 
3. Do you consider that the posology proposed would be adequate for the use in mild 
and/moderate Haemophilia A without inhibitors? 
It is possible that the current dose is not optimised and that lower doses might be equally effective and 
less likely associated with important risks. No comparison with alternative doses or regimens has been 
explored for the management of mild and moderate haemophilia A patients. However, it is acknowledged 
that treatment optimisation is difficult in this rare disease setting. Further research efforts, if feasible, will 
need to be guided by future findings from pharmacovigilance data about the harms of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 60/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Do you consider that it is possible, based on the available and upcoming data, in 
combination with an extrapolation approach, to extrapolate the use in patients < 2 years of 
age with mild or moderate haemophilia A without inhibitors. 
The expert group agreed that extrapolation to patients < 2 years is possible on the basis of 
pharmacological considerations. The ease of administration (subcutaneous) in this population is 
considered of critical importance for the patients with moderate haemophilia A and their families 
However, even in this population, the same consideration applies in terms of mild haemophilia patients, 
with careful assessment about the small subset that might need prophylaxis, and considerations about 
the harms and potential risks of available options.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has been demonstrated on the basis of Study HAVEN 6 which is a single-arm, open label, ongoing 
study with retrospective design. For treated bleeds, the NB regression model based ABR was 0.8 (95% 
CI: 0.41, 1.46) and the calculated mean ABR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.01, 5.13]). The majority of patients 
experience 0 treated bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (80.3% 57 patients).  
Limitations associated with the retrospective design and descriptive nature of the uncontrolled study were 
observed. However, in line with the outcome of the ad hoc expert group meeting convened on 22nd 
September 2022, it is agreed that Hemlibra represents an additional treatment option for prophylaxis that 
offers advantages in terms of ease of administration in patients with severe and moderate haemophilia. 
The benefits in prophylaxis for moderate haemophilia outweigh the risks given the morbidity and 
mortality associated with bleedings in this population.  
The CHMP agreed with the expert group recommendation that extrapolation to patients < 2 years is 
possible in this indication on the basis of pharmacological considerations and the clear advantage of the 
subcutaneous administration in this patients’ population. The ongoing HAVEN 7 study will continue to 
generate efficacy, safety, PK and PD data on the use of emicizumab in young patients with the final CSR 
expected in 2030 at the conclusion of a 7-year long term follow-up. 
Therefore, it was agreed to recommend the extension of indication for patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII inhibitors who have moderate disease (FVIII ≥ 1% 
and ≤ 5%) with severe bleeding phenotype in all age groups.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH provided the interim Clinical Study Report from Study BO41423 (HAVEN 6) which is a multicentre, 
open-label,  single-arm  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety,  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  and 
pharmacodynamics  of  emicizumab  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  haemophilia  A  without  inhibitors 
against FVIII. 
The safety objective is to evaluate the safety profile of emicizumab by the following endpoints:  
• Incidence and severity of AEs, with severity determined according to WHO Toxicity Grading Scale  
• Incidence of thrombo-embolism, thrombotic microangiopathy and severe hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, 
and anaphylactoid events  
• Change from baseline in physical, examination findings, vital signs and ECG parameters  
• Incidence of laboratory abnormalities  
• Incidence and severity of injection-site reactions  
• Incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation  
• Incidence and significance of anti-emicizumab antibodies  
• Incidence of de novo development of FVIII inhibitors  
Since the Development International Birth Date (DIBD) 28 June 2012, an estimated total of 917 patients 
have received emicizumab via clinical trial participation. 
In addition to the data from the interim analysis of HAVEN 6, the MAH provided the supportive safety data 
from ATHN 7 registry in the US. 
Patient exposure 
Of 72 patients enrolled in Study HAVEN 6, 71 patients started study treatment, and 59 patients (10 with 
mild disease and 49 with moderate) had completed at least 24 weeks in the study. 
Patients were treated with emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg QW (n=24), 3 mg/kg Q2W (n=39), and 6 mg/kg Q4W 
(n=8), based on patient choice of dosing schedule. In total, patients were exposed to emicizumab 
prophylaxis for a median duration of 26.14 weeks (range: 4.1 - 61.1). The median number of doses 
received in the QW group was 27.5, in the Q2W group was 16.0, and in the Q4W group was 10.5. 
Demographics 
The majority of treated patients were male (69 patients), and 2 were female. The median age was 23.0 
years (range: 2−71); 30 patients (42.3%) were <18 years of age and 41 patients (57.7%) were ≥18 
years of age.  
The median weight of patients at baseline was 75.0 kg (range: 13.5-141.0), and the median BMI was 
25.16 kg/m2 (range: 14.1-45.0).  
The majority of patients were white (84.5%).

Baseline Haemophilia A characteristics 
Of the 71 patients treated, 20 patients (28.2%) had mild haemophilia A and 51 patients (71.8%) had 
moderate haemophilia A.  
At study entry, 37 patients (52.1%) were on prophylactic treatment and 34 patients (47.9%) were on 
episodic treatment.  
Positive FVIII inhibitor titres occurring 5 or more years prior to study entry were reported for 1 patient, 
which was in line with study inclusion criteria. One patient did not have documentation of a negative 
inhibitor titre test (performed locally) within 8 weeks prior to enrolment but tested negative for FVIII 
inhibitor titres on study.  
The median number of bleeds in the 24 weeks prior to enrolment was 2.0 (range: 0-60). The overall 
proportion of patients with target joints (defined as at least 3 bleeds into the same joint over 24 weeks, 
or an unresolved target joint) was 33.8%. Target joints most frequently included the knee and ankle. 
The primary reasons investigators considered prophylaxis warranted for patients was a history of frequent 
bleeds (54.9%) and/or history of frequent joint bleeds. The two female patients were menarchal and had 
menstrual bleed history. Neither had heavy bleeding patterns but one had moderate flow and bleeding 
duration of 8-13 days. 
Prior Disease Other than Haemophilia A 
The majority of the enrolled patients (71.8%) reported at least one baseline medical condition other than 
haemophilia. The most frequently reported disorders were haemophilic arthropathy (11.3%), 
hypertension (9.9%), arthropathy (8.5%), seasonal allergy (7.0%), headache (7.0%), and pain (7%). 
Other medical disorders were reported infrequently and were typical for the patient population with 
haemophilia. 
Previous Surgeries and Procedures 
A total of 43 patients (60.6%) reported surgeries and procedures prior to participating in the study. There 
wasn’t a specific type of surgery/procedure that was commonly reported across patients as each 
surgery/procedure type was reported in ≤2 patients each. 
Previous medications for Haemophilia A: 
In the 24 weeks prior to enrolment, 38 treated patients (53.5%) received prophylactic FVIII treatment 
(57.9% of patients were using FVIII short acting and 42.1% were using FVIII long acting) and 34 
patients (46.5%) received episodic FVIII treatment (87.2% receiving FVIII and 15.4% receiving FVIII 
long acting). Thirty-five patients had received either FVIII or FVIII long-acting in the 7 days prior to first 
emicizumab dose. 
Previous Medication for Conditions Other than Haemophilia A 
Previous medications (i.e., those treatments collected outside the Bleed and Medication Questionnaire 
and stopped before entry into the study) were reported for 12 (16.9%) patients. The most frequently 
used class of medications was antihemorrhagics, reported in 8 (11.3%) patients (FVIII treatments taken 
in the week prior to the first dose of emicizumab were recorded on the eCRF page for patients who were 
continuing their prior FVIII prophylaxis until the second loading dose of emicizumab). All other drugs, by 
class, were reported for <3% of patients each. 
Previous and Concomitant Medication for Conditions Other than Haemophilia A 
Previous and concomitant medications were defined as non-haemophilia A treatments that were initiated 
prior to or at baseline and were continued at study entry (i.e., baseline treatments). The majority of 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 63/92 
 
 
 
 
patients (57.7%) were receiving at least one treatment at baseline, the most common being analgesics, 
reported for 14 (19.7%) patients. 
Concomitant Hemophilia A Treatments 
A total of 35 patients (49.3%) received episodically short or long acting FVIII as a treatment for bleeds.  
The majority of bleeds (n=29) were treated with short-acting FVIII. The median cumulative dose per 
bleed was 58.48 units/kg (range: 21.7−902.7), and the duration of treatment was 1 day for the majority 
(16 bleeds, 55.2%).  
High use of FVIII products in HAVEN 6 was driven by 4 patients (all enrolled at one study site) who had 
received higher amounts of short-acting FVIII treatment and constituted the upper quartile of cumulative 
dose of short-acting FVIII administered per bleed (cumulative dose >150 units/kg; 27.6%). A high 
variability of FVIII use between patients in a relatively small sample size of cohorts/arms is observed and 
the results on FVIII use in HAVEN 6 in part reflect the individual treatment approach of one study site.  
The majority of the patients who received short-acting FVIII treatment at any time during the study 
(n=17 of 21, 81.0%) used a peak dose of < 50 units/kg per treatment administration. The median 
number of doses administered was 3.0 (range: 1-44). 
The majority of patients who received long-acting FVIII treatment at any time during the study (n=12 of 
14, 85.7%) used a peak dose of < 50 units/kg per treatment administration. The median number of 
doses administered was 3.0 (range: 1-7).

Table 16 Treatment with FVIII per Treated Bleed (Treated Population)  
Of the 35 patients who received episodic non-emicizumab haemophilia medication, 20 received it after 
their 2nd loading dose of emicizumab (patients were allowed to continue their haemophilia treatments up 
to the 2nd loading dose of emicizumab to ensure adequate bleed control until effective emicizumab levels 
were achieved), 18 of whom used FVIII as treatment for a bleed, 7 of whom used FVIII as preventative 
for surgery/procedure, and 1 who used FVIII as preventative before activity. The most commonly used 
non-emicizumab haemophilia medications while on study (after the 2nd loading dose of emicizumab) 
were FVIII short-acting (12 of 20 patients) and FVIII long-acting (8 of 20 patients).  
No other haemophilia treatments (e.g., recombinant FVIIa, PCC, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, or 
DDAVP) were used to treat bleeds in the study. 
Concomitant Surgeries and Procedures 
Twenty patients (28.2%) reported surgeries and/or procedures during the study. Among 12 patients who 
reported surgeries, 10 patients had 19 minor surgeries and 2 patients had 2 major surgeries. 
Among 19 minor surgeries reported for 10 patients, 12 (63.2%) surgeries were managed with 
prophylactic hemophilia treatment, 3 of which also required treatment of postoperative bleeds. Both 
major surgeries were managed with prophylactic hemophilia treatment, 1 of which also required 
treatment for a post-operative bleed. 
All patients who received prophylactic medication for surgery/procedures or treatment for a post-surgical 
bleed received FVIII (either long or short acting).

Adverse events  
A total of 71 patients were included in the safety population. Of these, 49 (69.0%) patients reported 148 
AEs in total.  
Table 17 Overview of adverse events (treated population): 
A total of 69.0% (n=49) of patients experienced at least one AE. 
The most common AEs by SOC (≥10% of patients) were Infections and Infestations (23.9%, 17 patients), 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (19.7%, 14 patients), Musculoskeletal and Connective 
Tissue Disorders (18.3%, 13 patients), Gastrointestinal Disorders (16.9%, 12 patients), Nervous System 
Disorders (15.5%, 11 patients), Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications (14.1%, 10 patients), Skin 
and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (11.3%, 8 patients).  
The most common AEs by SOC with PTs in ≥ 5 % of patients were: 
- Infections and Infestations (23.9%, 17 patients): COVID-19 (7%, 5 patients) 
- General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (19.7%, 14 patients): Injection site reaction (5.6%, 
4 patients), Injection site erythema (5.6%, 4 patients) 
- Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (18.3%, 13 patients): Arthralgia (7%, 5 patients), Pain 
in extremity (5.6%, 4 patients) 
- Nervous System Disorders (15.5%, 11 patients): Headache (14.1%, 10 patients). 
 All AEs that were reported for the 49 patients were Grades 1-2 with the exception of Grade 3 concussion 
and Grade 3 hyperglycaemia (both in a single patient).  
The safety profile in study HAVEN 6 in the mild / moderate haemophilia A patients without inhibitors was 
consistent with previous HAVEN Studies (HAVEN 1, HAVEN 2, HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4) for haemophilia A 
with or without inhibitors in the primarily severe patient population. There were no new safety signals in 
HAVEN 6. The MAH provided in the appendices the list of AEs observed within 24 hours after emicizumab 
administration.

 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths reported during the study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Four patients reported a total of 6 SAEs.  
One patient who was using a defective insulin pump reported 3 SAEs (concussion, hyperglycemia and 
abdominal pain), while the remaining 3 patients reported one each of contusion, diverticulitis and COVID-
19 infection. 
All SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator and were reported to have 
recovered / resolved. No patients required dose modification due to SAEs. There were no discontinuations 
from treatment due to SAEs. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
None. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
No clinically meaningful post-baseline shifts were observed in haematology parameters (haemoglobin, 
neutrophils, and platelets).

Chemistry 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes in mean chemistry values for any parameter. No 
trends in shifts from baseline chemistry parameters were observed. Shifts of any magnitude in any 
parameter were sporadic; shifts from WHO Grade 0-2 at baseline to Grade ≥3 were reported in some 
patients. The changes were transient and returned to baseline for most patients. In some cases, the 
laboratory change was reported as an AE. None of the AEs reported for chemistry parameters were 
considered related to study drug, except one non-serious Grade 1 Hepatic enzyme increased, which 
resolved. Emicizumab was continued and there was no change in dosage of emicizumab due to this AE. 
Coagulation 
- 
Fibrinogen: Treatment with emicizumab had no effect on fibrinogen concentrations, which overall 
remained stable and generally below the upper limit of normal (4 g/L) throughout the study. Two 
patients had fibrinogen values over 5 g/L. One of these patients had an SAE of COVID-19 at the time 
of the high value; the other patient had no AE at the time of the high value. FVIII treatment during 
the study had generally no effect on fibrinogen concentrations. 
-  D-Dimer: Treatment with emicizumab had no effect on D-dimer concentrations, which overall 
remained stable throughout the study duration. The majority of samples contained D-dimer 
concentrations below the ULN (0.5 µg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units). One patient had high D-dimer 
(11.05 µg/mL) but there were no AEs reported for this patient around the time of the high D-dimer 
value. FVIII treatment during the study had generally no effect on D-dimer concentrations. 
- 
Prothrombin Fragment 1+2: Treatment with emicizumab had no effect on concentrations of PF1+2, 
which overall remained stable and generally within the normal range (2.4 - 7.9 ng/mL) throughout 
the study duration. Five patients were reported with elevated PF1+2 values; no AEs were reported 
around the time of these values. FVIII treatment during the study had generally no effect on PF1+2 
concentrations. 
Theoretical concerns of increased procoagulant risks have been raised with the administration of 
emicizumab on top of remaining endogenous FVIII activity, as encountered in patients with mild or 
moderate haemophilia A. However, data on the combination of emicizumab and FVIII on in vitro thrombin 
generation assay indicated that FVIII and emicizumab compete for binding to their targets, FIXa and FX, 
resulting in non-additive coagulation potential at normal (100 U/dL) FVIII concentrations. Furthermore, 
there was no indication of prothrombotic effects at high emicizumab exposure on top of the normal 
endogenous FVIII activity in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in normocoagulative cynomolgus monkeys. 
In Study HAVEN 6, emicizumab treatment in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia A, i.e. on top of 
residual endogenous FVIII activity, overall did not increase the peak height of thrombin generation above 
values seen in normocoagulative individuals. Following treatment with FVIII, immediate increases in FVIII 
activity reflecting the exogenous FVIII given (up to 176 U/dL) and thrombin generation were observed 
but TG values remained largely below upper normal limits (400-500 mM for peak height of thrombin 
generation). Similar investigations were performed for markers of activated coagulation and revealed 
stable values of D-dimer, PF1+2, and fibrinogen following FVIII administration. 
Emicizumab supports the formation of the intrinsic tenase in the absence of sufficient endogenous FVIII. 
In vitro data demonstrate an additive increase of thrombin generation in the presence of 1% or 10% of 
FVIII, levels representative of patients with moderate or mild haemophilia. Although emicizumab 
facilitates the intrinsic tenase reaction, its affinity for FIXa or FX is at least 10-fold lower than that of 
FVIIIa and enzymatic kinetics are not as strong as FVIIIa. These properties of emicizumab safeguard 
against the risk of a synergistic effect in thrombin generation with FVIIIa.

Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs 
No clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs parameters, including body temperature, pulse 
rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) were observed up to the time of the clinical 
cut-off date. 
Electrocardiograms 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in any ECG parameters (Heart Rate, PR duration, QRS duration, 
QT duration, QTcB, QTcF, and RR duration) noted at any study visit. There was no evidence of QT interval 
shortening or prolongation. 
Immunogenicity 
Two patients (2.8%) tested positive for ADAs in Study HAVEN 6. Overall, the rate of immunogenicity in this 
study in patients with mild or moderate haemophilia is consistent with that observed in previous studies. 
Out of the 2 patients who tested positive for ADA, 1 patient tested positive for the presence of neutralizing 
anti-emicizumab antibodies (nAbs). The presence of nAbs was not associated with decreased emicizumab 
concentration. 
No bleeding events (treated or all bleed) were reported by the 2 ADA positive patients and there were no 
reported events of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with ADA. 
A program-wide immunogenicity assessment of emicizumab (including Study HAVEN 6) indicated that 4.9% 
of patients (36/739 patients) developed ADAs against emicizumab and 2.6% (19/739) developed nAbs. In 
4 patients (0.5% of the total population), the presence of nAbs was associated with decreasing emicizumab 
concentrations. Among these 4 patients, 2 patients withdrew from the respective study (1 patient due to 
loss of efficacy and the other due to personal preference), 1 patient was still participating in the clinical trial 
(Study YO39309) as of CCOD and 1 patient completed the study (he was ADA negative at that point and 
moved to commercial emicizumab).  
Overall, the development of anti-emicizumab antibodies did not appear to affect the frequency or type of 
AEs reported. No SAEs of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with ADAs were reported, and there 
was no evidence of a causal relationship between anti-emicizumab antibodies and injection site reactions. 
While the presence of ADAs was associated with a slightly higher proportion of ISRs, for a majority of ADA-
positive patients, ISRs occurred before ADA detection.  
The incidence of patients who tested positive for ADAs remained low as expected for humanized monoclonal 
antibodies  (van  Brummelen  et  al.  2016).  Given  this  low  incidence  of  ADAs,  particularly  those  impacting 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, detection of ADAs, including anti-emicizumab nAbs, has limited 
effect  on  clinical  management,  suggesting  that  routine  laboratory  surveillance  is  not  warranted  for  the 
clinical  use  of  emicizumab.  A  progressive  loss  of  efficacy  manifested  by  an  increase  in  breakthrough 
bleeding events despite compliance with emicizumab dosing regimen, reduced emicizumab concentration, 
diminished chromogenic FVIII-like activity using an assay with human factors, or prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time could be indicators of the presence of clinically important ADAs. 
Anti-Factor VIII Antibody  
Emicizumab does not induce inhibitors against FVIII given the lack of sequence or structure homology with 
FVIII. In most patients with inhibitors against FVIII, titers remained stable or tended to decline. In patients 
without inhibitors in Studies BH30071 (HAVEN 3) and BO39182 (HAVEN 4), no instance of clinically relevant 
de novo inhibitor development was detected. In line with these findings, there were no instances of inhibitor 
development in mild or moderate patients from Study HAVEN 6.

Safety in special populations 
Adverse Events by Age 
Of the overall 71 patients treated with emicizumab in study BO41423 (HAVEN 6), 30 patients were <18 
years of age and at least one AE was reported in 18 patients. The remaining 41 patients were ≥18 years 
of age treated with emicizumab and at least one AE was reported in 31 patients. Overall, the AE profile 
was similar among all patients, irrespective of age, with however a slightly higher rate of AEs in patients 
≥18 years old (75.6%) compared to patients ˂18 years old (60.0%), although no difference in the 
severity or seriousness of AEs reported was observed. There were 2 patients ≥ 65 years of age.  
Adverse Events by Haemophilia Severity 
The AE profile was similar among all patients, irrespective of haemophilia severity (i.e., mild [n=20], 
moderate [n=51]).  
Of the 49 patients with AEs, 14 (70.0%) patients with mild haemophilia had 37 AEs, compared to 35 
(68.6%) patients with moderate haemophilia who had 111 AEs. There was no obvious difference in the 
rates of specific PTs, except 5 patients (9.8%) with moderate haemophilia A reported AEs of COVID-19 
compared to 1 patient (5%) with mild haemophilia A. There were no differences in the rates of SAEs 
between patients with mild or moderate haemophilia: 3 patients (5.9%) with moderate haemophilia had 
SAEs compared to 1 patient (5%) with mild haemophilia. However, there were a relatively small number 
of patients with any specific PT in each subgroup. The types of AEs reported in HAVEN 6 were consistent 
with what has previously been reported for the HAVEN 1 to 4 studies. 
Adverse Events by Race 
The majority of patients in the study were white (60 [84.5%]). Due to the very low number of patients 
enrolled in the study who were of other races, the effect of race on AEs is not evaluable. 
Phase III clinical trials Haven 1 to 4  
The safety profile of emicizumab from previous HAVEN studies (HAVEN 1, CCOD: 8 September 2017, 
HAVEN 2, CCOD: 5 October 2017, HAVEN 3, CCOD: 15 September 2017 and HAVEN 4, CCOD: 15 
December 2017), was used for the pooled analysis of ADRs for the proposed SmPC. The safety profile of 
emicizumab in mild/moderate haemophilia A patients without inhibitors (Study HAVEN 6) was consistent 
with previous HAVEN studies in the primarily severe haemophilia A with or without inhibitor patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no new information for drug interaction in study HAVEN 6. The prevention and the treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds having been managed by FVIII in the patients with non-severe haemophilia A 
without inhibitors included in HAVEN 6 study, no aPCC products have been used and hence there is no 
new information regarding the interaction between aPCC and emicizumab in this currently investigated 
subgroup. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
At the time of the CCOD for this interim analysis, 1 patient had discontinued prior to start of study 
treatment (personal choice) and none had withdrawn from the study after starting treatment.  
Among the 71 patients treated in HAVEN 6 study, none was withdrawn for a safety reason.

Supportive safety studies from real world data 
•  Study ATHN7 
The ATHN7 (American Thrombosis and Haemostasis Network) study is a longitudinal, natural history 
cohort study of the safety of the treatments used for people with haemophilia of all severities. 
The primary objective of the ATHN7 study is to determine the safety of non-factor products, bypassing 
agents or clotting factor replacement products when used for patients with haemophilia with or without 
inhibitors. The ATHN registry examines the use of haemophilia treatment products and their outcomes, 
which is being conducted at up to 50 ATHN-affiliated sites in the US. The ATHN7 study is part of the wider 
ATHN Transcends study, which is a natural history study of non-neoplastic hematologic disorders. 
In the full ATHN7 study, participants will be followed for 4 years from time of enrolment. The total study 
duration is 6 years. The current analysis provided by the MAH is a preliminary analysis from the first 
available emicizumab data until the latest available data up to April 30, 2021. 
Results: 
There were 35 patients in the emicizumab-treated cohort, of these 27 patients (77%) had mild or 
moderate haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors. 
Table 20 Baseline characteristics of the people with mild and moderate haemophilia A in the 
ATHN registry 
Among the 35 patients in the cohort, the mean standard deviation (SD) follow-up time was 397 (206) 
days, with a median interquartile range (IQR) of 399 (29, 744) days. The total follow-up was 13,910 
patient days or 38.08 years. The mean (SD) follow-up time among the 27 patients without FVIII 
inhibitors was 416 (197) days, with a median (IQR) of 436 (29, 744) days. 
One serious adverse event was recorded in the mild and moderate population over the 38.08 patient-
years. The serious AE rate was 0.026 per patient year. This was a case reported with traumatic 
hemorrhage (chronic subdural hematoma) assessed unlikely to be related to emicizumab by the treating 
physician. The ICH event likely occurred during the loading phase of emicizumab when therapeutic levels 
of emicizumab would not have been achieved. In the literature, a substantial proportion of ICH occur in 
older adults and patients with milder forms of hemophilia (Ljung, R.C.R., 2008). 
There were no cases of TMA or anaphylaxis. This analysis was limited by the small sample of patients with 
mild or moderate hemophilia A treated with emicizumab, a targeted list of AE categories, and relatively

short exposure time to emicizumab. At this interim analysis of real-world data, these AEs are consistent 
with the safety profile of emicizumab observed in clinical trials. 
TSUBASA  
The MAH provided, in the clinical summary of efficacy, interim data on the TSUBASA study, an 
observational study conducted in Japan, claiming that these data provide supportive safety data for the 
use of emicizumab in patients with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors. 
• 
Post-marketing data 
Since the DIBD 28 June 2012 and until the DLP of the PBRER (15 November 2020), an estimated total of 
917 patients have received emicizumab via clinical trial participation. In addition an estimated cumulative 
total of 10,787 patients have received emicizumab from marketing experience. 
Safety data from the clinical trials: 
A total of 223 SAEs were cumulatively retrieved for all company-sponsored interventional studies using 
emicizumab as an investigational drug. Review of these data did not identify any new safety concerns 
that could impact the safety profile of emicizumab. 
Safety data from Postmarketing data Sources: 
A total of 998 SAEs were cumulatively retrieved from post-authorization sources (Spontaneous, including 
health authority (worldwide), literature, non-interventional postmarketing study and reports from other 
solicited sources). Review of interval data did not identify any new safety concerns that could impact the 
well-known safety profile of emicizumab. A summary of the SOC under which AEs were most frequently 
reported from post-authorisation sources is shown below.

The MAH has assessed the relevant data that became available during the reporting interval of the most 
recent PBRER, including data from clinical trials, post-marketing, published literature, and other safety 
risk management sources. Based on the evaluation of these data, no new safety concerns were identified 
and all newly available information that became available during the reporting interval did not alter the 
known benefit-risk profile of emicizumab.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  MAH  provided  the  interim  safety  results  from  Study  BO41423  (HAVEN  6)  in  patients  with  mild  or 
moderate  haemophilia  A  without  inhibitors  against  FVIII,  according  to  the  EMA’s  request  following  the 
previous  application  for  this  extension  of  indication.  It  was  indeed  concluded  in  the  frame  of  the  first 
application  assessment  that  the  very  limited  data  that  had  been  provided  on  non-severe  haemophilia  A 
patients  were  not  sufficient  to  assess,  among  other  concerns,  the  safety  profile  of  emicizumab  in  this 
population, due to the hypothetical risk of thromboembolism associated to the administration of emicizumab 
in patients having an endogenous FVIII activity ≥ 1% and potentially receiving additional FVIII doses as 
part of bleeding management (the risk of elevated thrombin generation already being a concern in severe 
haemophilia patients only treated by emicizumab or by emicizumab in association to FVIII products). 
In total, 71 patients (20 with mild haemophilia A and 51 with moderate HA) in study HAVEN 6 were exposed 
to emicizumab prophylaxis for a median duration of 26.14 weeks. 59 patients (only 10 with mild disease 
and  49  with  moderate)  had  completed  at  least  24  weeks  in  the  study.  A  total  of  35  patients  (49.3%) 
received episodically short or long acting FVIII as a treatment for bleeds. No other haemophilia treatments 
than FVIII (e.g., recombinant FVIIa, aPCC, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, or DDAVP) were used to 
treat bleeds in the study which is a reassuring information (it is however to note that tranexamic acid was 
reported to be used in stomatological preparations in 11 patients concomitantly emicizumab exposure). Out 
of the 35 patients who received episodic non-emicizumab haemophilia medication, 20 received it after their 
2nd loading dose of emicizumab. Among 19 minor surgeries reported for 10 patients, 12 were managed 
with  prophylactic  haemophilia  treatment  (either  short  or  long  acting  FVIII),  3  of  which  also  required 
treatment  of  postoperative  bleeds.  Two  major  surgeries  were  managed  with  prophylactic  haemophilia 
treatment, 1 of which also required treatment for a post-operative bleed.  
49 out of the 71 patients reported 148 AEs in total as of 16 April 2021. There were no deaths, AEs of special 
interest (including thrombotic microangiopathy, thromboembolism, systemic hypersensitivity / anaphylactic 
/ anaphylactoid reaction) or AEs that led to withdrawal from treatment, AEs leading to dose modification, 
or AEs leading to study drug interruption that were reported. The AEs ventilation through the SOCs was 
consistent with the events that can be observed for the disease and consistent with the safety data observed 
in the previous studies of the clinical development of emicizumab.  
Eleven  patients  had  24  non-serious  adverse  reactions.  Most  of  the  ADRs  were  injection  site  reactions 
(injection  site  erythema  (5  patients),  injection  site  pain  (1  patient)  and  injection  site  reaction  (14  in  4 
patients, 1 patient having reported this ADR in 10 different occurrences). Also, one patient who reported 
an injection site erythema also had fatigue and a head discomfort, one patient had an increase of hepatic 
enzymes and there was one accidental overdose reported in one patient.  
The MAH compared the safety data retrieved in study HAVEN 6 between patients with mild haemophilia 
and patients with moderate haemophilia. No major difference between the two groups of patients was seen 
but the MAH acknowledges that the relatively small number of patients with any specific PT in each subgroup 
did not allow an adequate comparison. 
Based on the available data, the safety profile in the paediatric population did not appear to be different to 
that in adults.  
The vital signs and physical findings were not of concern within the interim results. 
Regarding  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  there  were  no  meaningful  observations  in  hematology 
parameters, but some meaningful changes of chemistry values were reported as AEs at different time points 
for some patients. In one case the AE of hepatic enzyme increase was assessed as an adverse reaction by 
the investigator. The coagulation parameters were tested throughout the study, and emicizumab exposure, 
associated or not to FVIII treatment, did not have a major effect on the levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer and 
Assessment report

Page 75/92 
 
 
 
 
PF1+2 concentrations. For some patients at different time points, elevated values were observed, but no 
AE that could be associated to a thromboembolic event was observed when these values were elevated.   
Even  though  the  AEs  and  ADRs  observed  in  HAVEN  6  study  did  not  bring  any  new  safety  information 
considering the currently known safety profile of emicizumab, these data are not considered as sufficient 
to conclude as the amount of exposed patients, the median duration of exposure and the median number 
of emicizumab doses are considered too low for the mild haemophilia subgroup. The number of patients 
having received a FVIII product concomitantly to emicizumab is also considered too small to appropriately 
assess  and  conclude  on  the  safety  consequences  of  such  treatment  associations  in  patients  with  a  non-
severe congenital haemophilia A.  
An update to the interim analysis has been provided as part of this procedure. The clinical cut-off date of 
the  primary  analysis  was  30  October  2021  resulting  in  a  median  emicizumab exposure of  54.29  weeks, 
which is more than double the median follow-up time of the interim analysis (16 April 2021). Overall, the 
safety  results  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  HA  without  FVIII  inhibitors  are  consistent  with  data 
previously observed at interim analysis. The pharmacodynamic and safety biomarkers assessed in the 72 
included patients did not show abnormal signs of interaction between emicizumab and endogenous FVIII 
and no safety biomarker that could signal a thrombotic event. One case of interest of anal vein thrombosis 
was observed but this case is not considered to add new information to the safety profile of emicizumab as 
the event was not considered as related to study treatment by the investigator but a potential triggering 
role of emicizumab cannot be fully excluded.  
Two patients (2.8%) tested positive for ADAs, 1 out of the 2 patients having tested positive for the presence 
of  neutralizing  ADAs  (nAbs)  (without  decreased  emicizumab  concentration  or  clinical  consequence 
associated). Regarding this issue, since the beginning of the MA for Hemlibra, there has been no available 
commercially validated assay for testing the ADA/nAb status in clinical use setting, as testing is only possible 
in the clinical trials held by the MAH, using a company validated assay. Therefore in case of increase in 
breakthrough bleeding events or evocative sign of loss of efficacy, evaluation is currently based on PK and 
clinical  assessment.  The  treatment  decision-making  can  only  rely  on  the  experience  and  practices  of 
specialized  centres.  This  likely  raises  a  concern  for  accurate  assessment  of  etiologic  factors  in  case  of 
increase in bleeding events. It is therefore needed that the MAH develops tests to measure neutralising 
antibodies outside clinical trials in order to investigate the etiology of loss of efficacy and to allow physicians 
to adapt Hemlibra treatment if necessary. 
The MAH provided, as supportive information, interim results for the ATHN7 study conducted in the US. 
Within this study 27 patients with non-severe haemophilia A without inhibitors have been included, which 
is very limited, and no adverse reaction was observed. The MAH also provided interim analysis of TSUBASA 
study,  conducted  in  Japan,  but  no  patients  with  mild  haemophilia  A  were  recruited,  15  patients  with 
moderate haemophilia A were recruited and no safety data have been made available yet. These data do 
not bring any new information. 
The safety of emicizumab in the post-marketing setting is regularly assessed throughout the PBRER and 
the PSUSA procedures. In addition to spontaneous reporting, the safety of emicizumab is monitored in two 
PASS (European registries EUHASS and PedNET). No particular safety concern was raised from the post-
marketing / clinical trial studies in patients with mild or moderate HA. Two thrombotic events were reported 
from post-marketing use and the potential facilitating role of emicizumab cannot theoretically be excluded 
but the patients’ medical history and multiple risk factors do not allow to draw any conclusion.  
Based on available data, the safety profile in the paediatric population does not appear to be different to 
that in adults.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC already mentioned that treatment with bypassing agents should be discontinued 
the day before starting Hemlibra therapy. In addition, the SmPC also recommends that patients receiving 
Hemlibra prophylaxis should be monitored for the development of thromboembolism when administering 
aPCC.  The  physician  should  immediately  discontinue  aPCC  and  interrupt  Hemlibra  therapy  if  clinical 
symptoms,  imaging,  and/or  laboratory  findings  consistent  with  thrombotic  events  occur  and  manage  as 
clinically indicated. 
Thrombo-embolic events will be further assessed in a PASS based on data from national registries (please 
see RMP). 
Based on the safety data submitted, the CHMP agree not to recommend an indication in routine prophylaxis 
of bleeding episodes in patients with Haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII 
inhibitor  who  have  mild  disease  considering  the  small  safety  database  in  this  patients’  population,  the 
potential risk of thromboembolic events which would not outweigh the need for prophylactic treatment.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submittedan updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.7 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The additional monitoring (black triangle) 
has also been removed. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
-  No significant changes affecting the readability of the package leaflet have been made;  
-  User consultation was carried out in the context of the initial MAA; the target group of users is similar 
between the initial approval indication and the proposed extension of indication, with no age 
difference; 
- 
The safety profile remains consistent with that observed in approved indication, with no new safety 
signals seen in mild or moderate HA patients without FVIII inhibitors.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH seeks to extend the currently approved indication statement for emicizumab to include adult 
and paediatric patients with HA without FVIII inhibitors who have mild or moderate disease for whom 
prophylaxis is clinically indicated. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard treatment for HA patients with severe bleeding phenotype is FVIII replacement therapy 
either episodic or prophylactic. Prophylactic therapy has been recognised as beneficial. However, due to 
the high treatment burden of FVIII prophylaxis, a substantial fraction of patients is only treated 
episodically in response to the occurrence of bleeding symptoms. 
Although standard definitions of HA severity are based upon laboratory FVIII activity and the residual 
plasma level of clotting factor is considered to be the most critical predictor of spontaneous bleeding, the 
determinants of clinical bleeding phenotype may be complex.  
For patients with HA with a severe phenotype (note that this may include patients with moderate HA with 
a severe phenotype), international organisations recommend regular long-term prophylaxis as the 
standard of care to prevent hemarthrosis and other spontaneous or breakthrough bleeding, maintain 
musculoskeletal health and promote quality of life.  
Prophylactic regimen varies between individuals according to differences in clinical and lifestyle 
characteristics. Reflecting this, it is becoming increasingly accepted that prophylactic regimen for non-
severe HA should be individualized and tailored to prevent bleeding for an individual level by taking into 
consideration his bleeding phenotype, joint status, clinical conditions (i.e. need for surgery), inter-patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 83/92 
 
 
 
 
PK variability, physical activities (daily and sporting), lifestyle, adhesion to therapy etc. This is of the most 
importance for young patients given that their physical activities and lifestyle are changing, as well as for 
mild HA patients (FVIII may up to 40%) who may not necessarily have abnormal or prolonged bleeding 
problems until they experience serious trauma or undergo surgery.  
For these reasons, the WFH recommends considering desmopressin as an option for treatment which is 
effective for the treatment of minor bleeding episodes in most patients with mild HA. Antifibrinolytic 
therapy such as tranexamic acid is also a valuable alternative particularly in controlling muco-cutaneous 
bleeding or for dental/oral procedures. In those mild HA patients unresponsive to DDAVP, replacement 
therapy with FVIII is the treatment of choice for bleeding episodes. To our knowledge, there is not any 
international organisation recommending the consideration of routine prophylaxis in mild HA without 
inhibitors.  
Given the wide intra- and inter-individual variability and in the context of concomitant use of several 
procoagulant drugs, individualised tailoring of prophylaxis treatment including flexibility of dosing is 
known as key to achieve optimal protection by adjusting for physical activity, lifestyle, individual PK 
without inducing hypercoagulability responsible for thrombotic complications. 
Emicizumab is designed as prophylactic agents to be used according to fixed dosing schedules, therefore, 
individualised tailoring of such treatment to meet the physical needs of the patient is not possible. 
According to the advice of the ad-hoc expert group (SAG), there are different views on the subgroup of 
non-severe haemophilia patients who might benefit from prophylaxis treatment. There is general 
agreement that currently, routine prophylaxis to be investigated for emicizumab would include moderate 
haemophilia patients with FVIII levels ≤5%: 
• who had a first spontaneous intra-articular bleed before the age of 5 years or 
• who were already started on a prophylaxis regimen with a long-term prophylaxis intention 
This SAG’s advice is in line with the recommendation of the WFH i.e. “Prophylaxis is the standard of care 
for people with severe haemophilia, and for some people with moderate haemophilia, or for those with 
another congenital bleeding disorder that is associated with a severe bleeding phenotype and/or a high 
risk of spontaneous life-threatening bleeding”. It is also consistent with recently published expert opinion 
(Valentino LA et al Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Jul;13:731-743) highlighting that early prophylaxis may 
also be appropriate for children with moderate haemophilia A who experience joint bleeding prior to age 5 
years and have a more severe bleeding pattern. Indeed, as discussed by experts, hemarthrosis accounts 
for more than 90% of all serious bleeding events, this hallmark typically begins early in childhood and 
one paramount benefit of long-term prophylaxis is joint protection. According to this expert opinion, 
although the subcutaneous administration with long-effect of emicizumab is an undeniably appealing 
prophylactic option for haemophilia, a major challenge to the widespread use of emicizumab and other 
pro-coagulant therapies is a lack of data regarding the overlap between the therapeutic window, where 
bleeding is prevented, and the toxicity window, where the risk of thrombosis increases. Large, multicenter 
studies are needed comparing ABR/AJBR in patients receiving FVIII versus emicizumab prophylaxis to 
justify the higher cost of this nonfactor therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application includes data from the Phase III Study BO41423 (HAVEN 6), which is a single-
arm, open label, ongoing, multicentre study evaluating the safety and efficacy of emicizumab. Patients of 
all ages with mild (FVIII > 5% and < 40%) and moderate HA (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) without FVIII 
inhibitors who warrant prophylactic treatment were enrolled. Furthermore, subjects should be able to 
provide documentation of the details of prophylactic or episodic FVIII treatment and of number of 
Assessment report

bleeding episodes during the last 24 weeks prior to enrolment for generating retrospective baseline data. 
Both patients on prophylactic and episodic FVIII treatment were enrolled.  
The sample size and timing for this specific interim analyses (IA) were not defined in the study protocol, 
and potential additional IAs were left undefined. There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study whose 
primary endpoint was safety. Primary efficacy endpoint was number of treated bleeds over time (i.e. 
bleed rate). All efficacy analyses are of descriptive / exploratory nature in this study.  
The emicizumab dosing regimen was 4 loading doses of emicizumab 3 mg/kg SC QW for 4 weeks followed 
by a maintenance dose of either 1.5 mg/kg SC QW, 3 mg/kg SC Q2W, or 6 mg/kg SC Q4W based on 
patient preference in this single-arm study. For the treatment of breakthrough bleeds, FVIII should be 
used at the lowest dose expected to achieve haemostasis. Other drugs intended to control bleeds e.g., 
bypassing agents, DDAVP, or antifibrinolytics were permitted. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary (treated bleeds) and secondary efficacy analyses were based on the treated population, by 
excluding all bleeds due to surgery/ procedure and by implementing 72 hour-rule: 
Follow up for a median of 27.5 weeks, the interim results indicated that: 
- For treated bleeds, the NB regression model based ABR was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.46) and the 
calculated mean ABR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.01, 5.13]). The majority of patients experience 0 treated bleeds 
while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (80.3% 57 patients). 
- For all bleeds (those treated and untreated with coagulation factors, the model based ABR was 2.3 
(95% CI: 1.63, 3.10) and the calculated mean ABR was 2.2 (95% CI: 0.31, 7.53).  
A total of 38 (53.5%) patients experienced all bleeds during the study by excluding bleeds due to 
surgery/ procedure and by implementing 72 hour-rule.  
A total of 33 treated bleeds (primary endpoint) were reported in 14 (19.7%) of 71 patients; 90.9% (30 of 
33 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds while the rest 9.1% (3/33 bleeds) were spontaneous bleeds (excluding 
bleeds due to surgery/procedure). Treated bleeds occurred most frequently in the joints (48.5%, 16/33 
bleeds) reported in 7 patients (9.9%) including 4 (5.6%) patients with treated target joint bleeds.  
- For treated joint bleeds and for treated spontaneous bleeds, the model-based ABR was 0.3 (95% CI: 
0.12, 0.65) and 0.1 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.23) respectively. 
- For treated target joint bleeds (including unresolved target joints), the model-based ABR did not 
converge due to a low number of bleeds with short follow-up times. The calculated mean ABR was 0.1 
(95% CI: 0.00, 3.93). 
Exploratory analyses by including bleeds due to surgery/procedure and irrespective of the 72-hour rule: a 
total of 109 bleeds occurred in 71 treated patients; 67.9% (74/109 bleeds) were traumatic bleeds, 22.9% 
(25/109 bleeds) were spontaneous bleeds, and 9.2% (10/109 bleeds) were due to surgery/procedure. 
Locations other than joints or muscle such as nose, mouth, and fingers/thumb represent 70.6% (77 of 
109 bleeds) reported in 28 patients. 
A post-hoc analysis was performed to compare ABR for All bleeds retrospectively collected by the patients 
in the 24 weeks prior to study entry with ABR collected during the efficacy period of this study. This 
analysis showed that the median estimated ABR prior to study entry was 4.3 (0.0-8.7) and the median 
calculated ABR for All Bleeds (72h-rule) was 1.5 (0.0-3.4).

Updated data (cut-off date 30 October 2021) with a median emicizumab exposure of 54.29 weeks (range: 
8.1- 89.1), showed that the safety and efficacy profile of emicizumab in patients with mild and moderate 
HA without FVIII inhibitors are consistent with data previously observed at interim analysis (cut-off date 
16 April 2021). 
At the cut off for primary analysis on 30 October 2021, none of the 38 participants who experienced one 
or more bleeding events tested positive for ADA, and no bleeding events were reported by the 2 
participants who were identified as ADA positive. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal trial is an ongoing, single arm, open-label study, the absence of a comparator is a clear 
limitation for the interpretation of study data. 
All efficacy analyses are of descriptive nature in this study, without formal hypothesis testing nor 
adjustment for multiplicity. So all analyses should be viewed as exploratory. 
The number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks before study entry has been collected retrospectively based on 
historic information collected by patients, which limits the interpretation of baseline bleeds in comparison 
with post-baseline data and makes questionable the accuracy and completeness of baseline data. 
Additional analyses were performed by the MAH to assess the potential bias in the retrospective collection 
of bleed data. However bias cannot be excluded nor quantified based on these exploratory analyses. It is 
still of concern due to the retrospective nature of pre-study data, and the comparability between baseline 
and post-baseline data remains doubtful. 
At the approved dosing, emicizumab does not completely restore normal haemostasis in mild/moderate 
patients enrolled in this study and more than half of treated patients (38/71, 53.5%) still experience on-
study bleeds by excluding bleeds due to surgery/ procedure and by implementing 72 hour-rule. 
Development of neutralising anti emicizumab antibodies with decreasing emicizumab concentration 
leading to loss of efficacy has been observed during clinical trials. At this stage of knowledge, in absence 
of a commercially validated assay specific for assessing the antidrug antibody status with emicizumab, 
treatment decision-making can only rely on the experience and practices in place in specialised centres 
according to scientific guidelines. 
A post-hoc analysis was performed to compare ABR for All bleeds retrospectively collected by the patients 
in the 24 weeks prior to study entry with ABR collected during the efficacy period of this study. During 
emicizumab treatment, the ABR increased in 13 patients compared to their pre-study estimated ABR, 20 
patients with stable ABR and 38 patients with decreased ABR respectively. Of the 24 patients who 
presented target joint bleeds prior to study, 7 had bleeds in their target joints and of those 4 required 
additional treatment for target joint bleeds during the efficacy period. 
A total of 35 patients (49.3%) received a FVIII medication during the study. The median cumulative dose 
per bleed was 58.48 units/kg (range: 21.7-902.7) and the median number of doses administered was 3.0 
(range: 1-44). This median cumulative dose of short-acting FVIII per bleed administered in HAVEN 6 is 
numerically higher than that used in patients with severe HA without inhibitor in HAVEN 3 (Arm A: 37 
unit/kg, Arm B: 27 unit/kg, and Arm D: 46 units/kg with patients who had received FVIII prophylaxis 
prior to study entry) as well as in HAVEN 4 expansion cohort (25.32 units/kg). 
12 patients reported a total of 19 minor and 2 major surgeries. All major surgeries still required FVIII 
prophylaxis and FVIII substitution for post-operative bleeds in 1 of 2 patients. Almost two-third of minor 
surgeries were managed with FVIII prophylaxis including 3 postoperative bleeds managed by FVIII. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 86/92 
 
 
 
 
The baseline bleeding characteristics (treated or not, spontaneous or trauma/surgery related, location, 
severity…) were not collected, thus cannot be taken into account into analysis. 
The rate of major protocol deviations is high: 117 major protocol deviations reported in 48 of 71 patients 
(67.6%).  
In the clinical study report, the 72-hour rule as well as bleed exclusion rule (when due to 
surgery/procedure) were not consistently used across both baseline and post-baseline periods. Both rules 
were only applied for on-study bleeds calculation but not for estimation of retrospective baseline bleeds, 
thus potentially leading to misleading interpretation of baseline versus post-baseline bleeds. The MAH has 
now conducted a sensitivity analysis where ABR statistics are derived for on-study ABR and prior study 
ABR, both without and with the 72 hour rule. It is noted that ABR model-based estimates are slightly 
lower when applying the 72 hour rule, for on-study ABR as well as for prior study ABR. On-study ABR 
model-based estimates are numerically smaller than prior study ABR, and a larger proportion of patients 
with zero bleeds is observed for post-baseline bleeds, with and without the 72 hour rule. As mentioned 
above, concerns remain regarding bias and the comparability of baseline and post-baseline periods, due 
to the retrospective nature of pre-study data.  
The studied population is highly heterogeneous: a half on FVIII prophylaxis and another half on episodic 
treatment at study entry. Regarding patients receiving prophylaxis at inclusion, the reasons why patients 
warrant prophylaxis do not seem consistent with the patient’s bleeding history. 
The need for prophylaxis at inclusion was only based on investigator’s individual decision. The analysis of 
the haemophilia history data from HAVEN 6 demonstrated the heterogeneity of reasons for warranting 
prophylaxis in the study participants.  
No patient younger than 2 years was enrolled. One of the biggest problems at an early stage after birth is 
how to avoid the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). However, considering the PK of 
subcutaneous emicizumab, it might not be expected to exert a haemostatic effect immediately even if 
administered at an early stage after birth. After 1 or 2 years, bleeding frequency increases due to an 
increase in activity associated with normal growth and development of infants, trauma, and patients most 
often experience initial joint bleeding. Hence, in response to an increase in the bleeding risk, this stage is 
generally the time to introduce prophylactic replacement therapy. Therefore, it should be discussed 
carefully in the clinical situation where early administration of emicizumab after birth is warranted. 
Experts from the ad hoc expert group expressed their views on the clear advantage of Hemlibra being 
administered subcutaneously for this age group and that the efficacy can be based on the 
pharmacological considerations. The ongoing HAVEN 7 study will continue to generate efficacy, safety, PK 
and PD data on the use of emicizumab in young patients with the final CSR expected in 2030 at the 
conclusion of a 7-year long term follow-up. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the current clinical use setting in the authorised indication: 
The known safety profile for Hemlibra depicts mostly injection site reactions, arthralgia and headache.  
Emicizumab interferes with some laboratory coagulation tests.  
The association of emicizumab with aPCC products should be avoided or used with caution due to the risk 
of thromboembolic events and thrombotic microangiopathy.  
The increased risk of thrombosis in patients not concomitantly treated by aPCC is a potential safety concern 
(important potential risk in the RMP). 
Assessment report  
EMA/9454/2023 
Page 87/92 
 
 
 
 
Interim  safety  results  from  HAVEN  6  study  did  not  bring  any  new  information  on  the  safety  profile  of 
emicizumab, therefore the limited available data on this study does not modify the currently known safety 
profile and does not raise issue in the investigated population. In addition safety data from post-marketing 
use  and  post-marketing  safety  studies  did  not  raise  concern  within  the  subgroup  with  non-severe 
haemophilia A. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Of the 71 exposed patients, 20 had mild haemophilia A and 51 had moderate haemophilia. Only 59 patients 
(including only 10 with mild disease) had completed at least 24 weeks in the study. Globally the amount of 
patients, the median duration of exposure, the median number of emicizumab doses and the amount of 
concomitant exposure to FVIII are considered as not sufficient to conclude on the safety profile. 
While it is not associated with strong evidence, a higher risk of elevated thrombin generation increasing 
the  risk  of  thromboembolic  event  in  severe  haemophilia  patients  only  treated  by  emicizumab  or  by 
emicizumab  in  association  to  FVIII  products  is  viewed  as  a  possibility  that  cannot  be  excluded  at  the 
moment. A PASS based on multinational registries is requested as part of the RMP. An additional uncertainty 
is  raised  in  non-severe  HA  patients  who  have  endogenous  FVIII  activity  levels  ≥  1%  and  who  would 
moreover need to receive additional FVIII dosing for bleeding treatment. 
Since the MAH did not provide any non-clinical testing results to further support the claimed indication, the 
clinical data are the only source of information for this particular subgroup and therefore need to rely on a 
substantial amount of exposure data, even more so considering the MAH’s assertion on the absence or the 
low additive coagulation potential of emicizumab associated to FVIII. 
An update to the interim analysis has been provided in response to RSI D120. The clinical cut-off date of 
the  primary  analysis  was  30  October  2021  resulting  in  a  median  emicizumab exposure of  54.29  weeks, 
which is more than double the median follow-up time of the interim analysis (16 April 2021). Overall, the 
safety  results  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  HA  without  FVIII  inhibitors  are  consistent  with  data 
previously observed at interim analysis. The pharmacodynamic and safety biomarkers assessed in the 72 
included patients did not show abnormal signs of interaction between emicizumab and endogenous FVIII 
and no safety biomarker that could signal a thrombotic event. 
In addition, no particular safety concern was raised from the post-marketing / clinical trial studies in patients 
with mild or moderate HA.  
Considering the low patients number included in the mild haemophilia subgroup and the potential safety 
risk of thrombo-embolic events, it was agreed only to include the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes 
in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII 
inhibitors who have moderate disease (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) with severe bleeding phenotype.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
With this application, the MAH is submitting interim analyses of an ongoing, single-arm, open label study 
(HAVEN 6). 
Efficacy has been demonstrated on the basis of Study HAVEN 6 which is a single-arm, open label, ongoing 
study with retrospective design. For treated bleeds, the NB regression model based ABR was 0.8 (95% 
CI: 0.41, 1.46) and the calculated mean ABR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.01, 5.13]). The majority of patients 
experience 0 treated bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (80.3% 57 patients).  
However, it has to be noted that some limitations are noted for HAVEN 6 study: 
The efficacy observed in patients with inhibitors or severe HA cannot be easily extrapolated to patients 
with possible almost adequate residual endogenous FVIII activity (up to 40%). The accuracy for the 
estimation of baseline bleeds collected in a retrospective manner, as well as the comparability and 
potential bias between baseline versus post-baseline ABR are questionable, making impossible to draw 
any reliable conclusion from all analyses of Study HAVEN 6 due to its descriptive and exploratory nature.  
HAVEN 6 enrolled both patients receiving prophylactic and episodic FVIII treatment prior to study entry. 
The reasons why patients warrant prophylaxis do not seem to consist with patient’s bleeding history. 
Indeed, half of patients with minor disease received FVIII prophylaxis prior to study, while they had not 
experienced any bleed in the last 24 weeks. In contrast, half of patients with minor disease received only 
episodic treatment, while they all had a history of severe bleeding and/or frequent (joint) bleeding in the 
last 24 weeks. HAVEN 6 was designed to be inclusive of the full spectrum of reasons why a patient with 
m/m HA without inhibitor warrants prophylaxis irrespective of their prior treatment (PUT or PTP, episodic 
or prophylactic). A major challenge to the widespread use of emicizumab and other pro-coagulant 
therapies is a lack of data regarding the overlap between the therapeutic window, where bleeding is 
prevented, and the toxicity window, where the risk of thrombosis increases.  
At the approved dosing, emicizumab does not completely restore normal haemostasis in mild/moderate 
patients enrolled in this study. A total of 109 bleeds occurred in 71 treated patients irrespective of 72-
hour rule and bleeds exclusion rule (when related to surgery/procedure). During emicizumab treatment, 
the ABR increased in 13 patients compared to their pre-study estimated ABR, 20 patients with stable ABR 
and 38 patients with decreased ABR respectively. Of the 24 patients who presented target joint bleeds 
prior to study, 7 had bleeds in their target joints and of those 4 required additional treatment for target 
joint bleeds during the efficacy period. A total of 35 patients (49.3%) received a FVIII medication during 
the study. Of these 35 patients, 20 patients received a FVIII after their 2nd loading dose of emicizumab.  
During the study, 12 patients reported a total of 19 minor and 2 major surgeries. Under the haemostatic 
coverage of emicizumab alone in mild and moderate HA, all major surgeries still required FVIII 
prophylaxis and FVIII for post-operative bleeds in 1 of 2 patients. Almost two-third of minor surgeries 
were managed with FVIII prophylaxis including 3 postoperative bleeds managed by FVIII. 
Data are missing in patients < 2 years with m/m HA without inhibitors. It should be noted that 
Emicizumab binds to FIXa and FX, both factors are comparatively low in neonates and their level depends 
also on prematurity, hepatic immaturity and vitamin K deficiency. The FXI gradually increases to adult 
normal values possibly beyond 2 years of age. Of note, in a mouse model the efficacy of emicizumab was 
significantly altered when human FIX and FX levels were low. The ongoing HAVEN 7 study will continue to 
generate efficacy, safety, PK and PD data on the use of emicizumab in young patients with the final CSR 
expected in 2030 at the conclusion of a 7-year long term follow-up.

In line with the recommendations of the ad hoc expert group meeting, it is agreed that Hemlibra is an 
additional treatment option for prophylaxis that offers advantages in terms of ease of administration, and 
consequently, quality of life, in patients with severe and moderate haemophilia. The benefits in 
prophylaxis for moderate haemophilia clearly outweigh the risks given the morbidity and mortality 
associated with bleedings in this population. 
With regards to safety; the safety results in patients with mild and moderate HA without FVIII inhibitors 
are consistent with data previously observed at interim analysis. The pharmacodynamic and safety 
biomarkers assessed in the 72 included patients did not show abnormal signs of interaction between 
emicizumab and endogenous FVIII and no safety biomarker that could signal a thrombotic event. While 
the available interim safety data from study HAVEN 6 did not show a difference in the safety profile of 
emicizumab compared to the identified risks observed throughout the clinical development and are listed 
in the SmPC. A total of 148 AEs were observed but no concern involving thrombosis or thrombotic 
microangiopathy was reported. The monitoring of coagulation laboratory parameters did not detect a 
pattern of abnormal results (some elevated values were observed but without any associated AE). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite several methodological limitations, efficacy has been demonstrated on the basis of Study HAVEN 
6 which is a single-arm, open label, ongoing study with retrospective design. 
No specific safety issues were reported in the HAVEN 6 study. Considering that patients with thrombo-
embolic risk factors were excluded from the study, a PASS based on data from multi-national registries 
have been requested in order to investigate any potential risk of thrombosis when Hemlibra is given in a 
real life setting (please see RMP).  
Consequently, the CHMP agrees with this extension of indication to include routine prophylaxis of bleeding 
episodes in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without 
factor VIII inhibitors who have moderate disease (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) with severe bleeding phenotype. 
Hemlibra can be used in all age groups. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Hemlibra in the extended indication to include the routine prophylaxis of bleeding 
episodes in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without 
factor VIII inhibitors who have moderate disease (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) with severe bleeding 
phenotype in all age groups is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

Extension of indication to include routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in adult and paediatric patients 
with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII inhibitors who have moderate 
disease (FVIII ≥ 1% and ≤ 5%) with severe bleeding phenotype. Hemlibra can be used in all age groups. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and Section 1 of the package leaflet are 
updated. In addition, Section 4.2 is updated to make it clear that the maintenance dose for Hemlibra 
applies from week 5 of dosing. The PIL is updated accordingly. Version 4.7 of the RMP has also been 
submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0196/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
No significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan P/0196/2016 have been completed, in 
accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, after the entry into force of that 
Regulation. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Hemlibra is not similar to Roctavian within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

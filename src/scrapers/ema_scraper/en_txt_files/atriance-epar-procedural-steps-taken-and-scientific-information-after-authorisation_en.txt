A cumulative review cases of rhabdomyolysis and/or 
rhabdomyolysis and blood creatine phosphokinase 
II, Labelling 
creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased was conducted and 
increased as rare adverse reactions. The package 
and PL 
retrieved 16 cases, as of 16 August 2011.  Although most 
leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet and to make 
minor editorial changes. Furthermore, the MAH 
proposed to bring the product information in line 
with the latest QRD template (version 8, revision 1). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
of the 16 cases were confounded due to concurrent 
disease(s) and/or concomitant medications, there were five 
reports which suggest a potential causal relationship to 
nelarabine was considered possible.  
As a consequence, rhabdomyolysis and elevated creatine 
phosphokinases in the blood were added to the product 
information as adverse reactions with a rare frequency.

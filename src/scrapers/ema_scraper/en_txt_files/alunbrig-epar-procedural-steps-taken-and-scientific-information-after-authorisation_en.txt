SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Alunbrig in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add 
drug-drug interaction information about the effect of 
brigatinib on the pharmacokinetics of a sensitive 
cytochrome P450 3A substrate (midazolam) in 
patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive solid 
tumours based on a clinical study report (Study 
1001). Update of section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in 
order to update drug-drug interaction information 
regarding concomitant treatment with moderate 
CYP3A inducers based on results of previously 
submitted studies (physiologically-based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) report and PBPK report 
avoided, the dose of Alunbrig may be increased in 30 mg 
increments after 7 days of treatment with the current 
Alunbrig dose as tolerated, up to a maximum of twice the 
Alunbrig dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of 
the moderate CYP3A inducer. After discontinuation of a 
moderate CYP3A inducer, Alunbrig should be resumed at 
the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the 
moderate CYP3A inducer. 
In patients with cancer, coadministration of multiple 180 
mg daily doses of Alunbrig with a single 3 mg oral dose of 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased 
midazolam Cmax by 16%, AUC0-INF by 26%, and AUC0-
last by 30%, relative to a 3 mg oral dose of midazolam 
addendum). Update section 5.1 of the SmPC in order

between exposure to brigatinib and subsequent 
development of photosensitivity reaction; the

editorial change in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

photodermatosis was reported in 5.8% of patients and 
Grade 3-4 occurred in 0.7% of patients. Dose reduction 
occurred in 0.4% of patients. 
Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure 
while taking Alunbrig, and for at least 5 days after 
discontinuation of treatment. When outdoors, patients

As a result of the fulfilment of the PASS, removal of the 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0041 – Variation 
II and PL 
additional monitoring statement and the black triangle from 
the product information is warranted. Annex II of the 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Daxas 
PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.  
In addition, the SmPC and Package leaflet were updated in 
line with the latest QRD template.

C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the

SmPC, Annex 
Following a request from PRAC, the MAH submitted this 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
II and PL 
type II variation to implement changes related to 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
reclassification and removal of safety concerns as well as 
reviewing the need of additional Risk Minimisation 
Measures.  
The important identified risk: Angioedema, the important 
potential risks: gynecomastia, pancreatitis, persistent 
intolerability in high-exposure populations, off-label use  
and the missing information: intake of immunosuppressive 
medications, severe immunological diseases, mild, 
moderate or sever hepatic impairment, combination of 
roflumilast with theophylline for maintenance therapy and 
use during pregnancy and lactation have been removed. 
These changes are endorsed but pancreatitis and patients 
with mild hepatic impairment classified as Child Pugh A 
should continue to be closely monitored in the next PSURs.  
Page 4/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious diarrhoea has been upgraded as an important 
idenfied risk.  
The important identified risk psychiatric disorders 
(insomnia, anxiety, panic attack, nervousness, depression, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour) and the important potential 
risk of triggering suicide remain unchanged, the proposal of 
the MAH to merge both risks was not endorsed. Of note, 
one of the secondary  objective of the PASS category 1 is 
to compare the incidences of death by suicide or 
hospitalisation for suicide attempt, between roflumilast 
treated COPD patients  and COPD patients not treated with 
roflumilast Therefore, an additional pharmacovigilance 
activity is ongoing for this safety concern.   
The important potential risks infections and cardiac safety 
have been renamed as lower respiratory tract infections 
and major cardiovascular events respectively. However, 
new diagnosis of tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or other 
severe viral hepatitis infection are endpoints of the PASS 
category 1 which is ongoing for Roflumilast  and therefore 
the PRAC requested that the risk of infections remains 
unchanged as an important potential risk. 
Based on the post-marketing data and post marketing 
experience gained, the PRAC considered that additional 
Risk Minimisation Measures in place are no longer needed. 
They have therefore been removed from the RMP.

SmPC in order to update the safety information based on 
completion of Clinical Study RO-2455-404-RD ("REACT"). 
The REACT study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group, multicenter, placebo controlled phase 3b/4 study 
performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
roflumilast on top of a fixed dose of long-acting Beta 2-
agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in 
patients with severe COPD. Results indicate that treatment 
with roflumilast may lead to a higher risk of sleep disorders 
(mainly insomnia) in patients with a baseline body weight 
of <60 kg, due to a higher total PDE4 inhibitory activity 
found in these patients.

reports of angioedema received in the framework of post-
and PL 
marketing surveillance since market introduction of 
Addition of ‘angioedema’ as undesirable effect in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC with frequency ‘rare’ as 
requested by the CHMP following the assessment of 
PSUR 3. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. Additionally, the information regarding 
allergic reactions in section 4 of the PL was updated 
in accordance with the review of cumulative cases 
reported. Changes were also made to the PI to bring 
it in line with the latest QRD template. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
roflumilast (05 July 2010 – 05 July 2012) revealed a total 
of 55 medically confirmed and non-medically confirmed 
cases reporting terms potentially suggestive of 
angioedema. Thirteen of these reports were serious, all of 
which were reported spontaneously. A total of 42 non-
serious reports have been received to date; seventeen 
were reported from studies and the remainder were 
spontaneous reports. Five of the serious cases reported the 
term angioedema, 4 reported face swelling and there were 
two reports of tongue swelling. Of the non-serious cases, 5 
reported the event face swelling, 4 reported the event of 
swollen tongue, 3 reported eye/eyelid swelling and there 
were two reports of lip swelling and pharyngeal oedema 
respectively. There have been single non serious reports of 
angioedema, oropharyngeal swelling and mouth oedema. 
Despite the absence of a clear pharmacological 
pathogenesis, based on this cumulative review, 
angioedema may be associated with the use of roflumilast.

Key factors supporting this conclusion include: 1 case with 
a possible positive rechallenge, 5 cases with a possible 
positive dechallenge and 9 cases with a plausible temporal 
relationship. Although these reports provided limited 
information, the overall body of evidence supports an 
association between roflumilast and angioedema. It is 
therefore recommended that angioedema be included as an 
ADR in the roflumilast PI.

In the reporting period of PSUR 2 for roflumilast (6 January 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) of roflumilast 
regarding the risk of psychiatric disorders in line with 
the available post-marketing data as requested by 
the CHMP following the assessment of the 2nd PSUR. 
Annex II and sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet 
have been updated accordingly and the list of local 
representatives has been updated. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a

MAH 
II and PL 
2011 – 5 July 2011), more than 26% of the ADRs reported 
were serious. Among these more than 26% reported an 
ADR related to a potentially risk of triggering suicide 
(suicidal ideation (17), attempt suicide (2), completed 
suicide (2)), and more than 40% reported an ADR related 
to depression (depression (16), depressed mode (2), 
anxiety (8), insomnia (4), nervousness (4)).  
During the reporting period, of the seventeen (17) cases of 
suicidal ideation, seven (7) occurred rapidly, already on the 
day of the start of treatment with roflumilast or within the 
first week of treatment. In eight (8) reports, time to onset, 
ranged between 10 days and 2.5 month and in two (2) 
reports the time to onset was unknown but reported 
rechallenge positive. 
Among these seventeen (17) cases, eight (8) reports 
presented a medical history of psychiatric problems related 
to depression, anxiety and panic disorders, alcohol 
problems and anorexia and six (6) reports no presented 
previous history of depression 
Despite the high prevalence and incidence of depression in 
patients with severe COPD, a causal relationship between 
roflumilast and suicidal ideation or behaviour can’t be 
excluded. According to the post-marketing experience, 
suicidal ideation could appear in patients without a previous 
history of depression and the time to onset could range 
between one day and several weeks. In addition, medical 
history of psychiatric problems such as anxiety, panic 
disorders, anorexia and alcoholism, among others, could be 
risk factors of these ADR on suicidal ideation.

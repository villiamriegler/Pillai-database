Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for SITAGLIPTIN, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The evidence on the association between bullous pemphigoid and the use of DPP-4 inhibitors including 
sitagliptin is growing. The four cases reported in literature, of which one showed a clear positive 
dechallenge, suggest a causal relationship between sitagliptin and bullous pemphigoid. Confounding 
factors do not seem to explain the occurrence of these cases. Based on these literature cases, the 
possible mechanism, and further spontaneous reports, the PRAC was of the view that “bullous 
pemphigoid” should be added to the product information as an adverse drug reaction. 
In addition, based on the literature and reported cases of polyarthritis and arthropathy, the product 
information should be updated to include arthropathy as an adverse drug reaction. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding sitagliptin, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for SITAGLIPTIN the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal products containing SITAGLIPTIN is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

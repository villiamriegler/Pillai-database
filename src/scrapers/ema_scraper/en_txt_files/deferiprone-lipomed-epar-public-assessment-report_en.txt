Deferiprone is a white crystalline powder, slightly sweet (caramel) odour. It is slightly soluble in cold 
water, soluble in hot water. It is a neither hygroscopic, nor chiral, compound.  The active substance is 
micronised before being used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
No information on polymorphic forms has been described in the literature. Analysis was performed on 
batches of deferiprone before and after micronisation. No difference or change in the polymorphic form 
could be observed either for batches after long term storage or after the micronisation process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the application 
dossier and in the restricted part of an ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
The synthetic route of the active substance used is known from literature. Deferiprone is synthesized in 
one main step using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
The commercial batch sizes of pure deferiprone have been defined.  Adequate in-process controls are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the active substance and its 
impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and 
actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged, stored and shipped in LDPE bags which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are placed inside a cardboard drum. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, UV), melting point (Ph. 
Eur.), impurities (HPLC, GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay (titration), residual 
solvents (GC), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Appropriate justification of the specification and limits was made according to the requirements of the 
general monograph of Ph.Eur. and relevant EU quality guidelines. Impurities present are controlled in line 
with ICH Q3A guideline. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for identity and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data for a sufficient number of batches) of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested in the stability studies: appearance, assay, purity, impurities. All 
tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results of related 
substance (impurity) testing by HPLC on forced degradation samples under stress conditions were also 
provided on one batch. During the forced degradation studies, almost no appreciable changes were 
observed for thermal stress and photolytic degradation, although there was a brownish colouration of

deferiprone. Deferiprone showed some degradation by acidic hydrolysis and to a lesser extent by basic 
hydrolysis. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the 
proposed retest periods of 5 years in the proposed container with no special storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as oval white to almost white film-coated tablets containing 500 mg of 
deferiprone as active substance. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
The finished product is packed in blisters consisting of transparent, thermo-formable rigid PVC film, PVDC 
coated and aluminium foil with heat-sealing lacquer packed in a cardboard box. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Deferiprone is an oral iron chelating agent (ATC code: V03AC02). The intention of the pharmaceutical 
development of the medicinal product was to create an immediate release solid dosage form with the 
active substance deferiprone at a strength of 500 mg per tablet which is bioequivalent to the reference 
medicinal product, Ferriprox 500 mg film-coated tablets. 
Deferiprone Lipomed and Ferriprox have the same qualitative composition in terms of excipients, apart 
from inclusion of croscarmellose sodium in the Deferiprone Lipomed formulation as an additional 
excipient. Comparative impurity profile data for Deferiprone Lipomed and Ferriprox has been provided. 
The proposed commercial formulation of Deferiprone Lipomed is identical to that used in the 
bioequivalence study, apart from a slight reduction in the target amount of film-coating to make sure that 
that there are no differences between the actual formulation used for the bioequivalence study and the 
future commercial formulation.  
The physicochemical property which is most relevant with regard to the in vivo performance of the 
finished product, is the particle size of the active substance. Appropriate acceptance limits have been 
established for the particle size distribution based on the experience gained during development and the 
batches used for the bioequivalence study. 
During development, in vitro dissolution testing was performed in various media across the physiological 
pH range. An appropriate dissolution method was chosen for routine quality control (QC) testing of 
finished product. The discriminatory power of this dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
A bioequivalence study was performed which demonstrated in vivo bioequivalence between the test 
product, Deferiprone Lipomed, and the reference product, Ferriprox. The clinical assessment of this 
bioequivalence study is discussed in section 2.4 of this report.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following steps: preparation of granulation liquid, granulation 
of the active substance, preparation of compression mixture, compression, preparation of film-coating 
solution, preparation of film-coating suspension, film-coating, blistering, secondary packaging. 
Assessment report  
EMA/535221/2018  
Page 8/26 
 
 
 
 
 
Appropriate in-process controls are applied throughout the process. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a 
number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: visual 
appearance, dimensions, average mass, uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), identity of active substance 
(HPLC, UV), identity of colourant (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for 12 months (2 batches) 
and 24 months (one batch) under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), intermediate conditions (30 ºC 
/ 65% RH) and for up to 6 months (2 batches) and 12 months (one batch) under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Samples were tested as per the shelf life specifications. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. However, not all parameters were tested for each storage time point. 
Supportive stability data from seven development batches  stored up to 60 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH)  and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
However, as some crucial specification parameters have not been tested in the stability specification of 
these historic batches, the data obtained from these studies can be treated as supportive only. 
There were no out of specification results or trends observed for appearance, assay, impurities, hardness 
or dissolution results at any storage conditions. The test parameter loss on drying was out of specification 
in all three commercial batches after 6 months storage at accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) and 
was out of specification in two batches after 12 months storage at intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% 
RH). It was concluded that this increase in loss on drying results is linked to the relative humidity (RH) of 
the storage conditions. The loss on drying result remained within specification at long term conditions (25 
ºC / 60% RH) up to 12 months in all three primary stability batches (and at 24 months for one of the 
batches). The observed out of specification results on loss on drying do not likely pose any risk to product 
quality as there is no impact on any other specification parameters (i.e. dissolution or impurities) at the 
levels detected .Nevertheless, in the absence of any long term data relating to this parameter from the 
supportive studies, the approved final shelf-life and storage conditions are based on the available 12 
months long term data from the three recent commercial batches.  
Stability data for one batch of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets stored as bulk 
(film-coated tablets prior to blistering) covering 6 months of storage at 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH 
Assessment report  
EMA/535221/2018  
Page 9/26 
 
 
 
 
 
are provided. The acceptable holding time for the bulk tablets prior to packaging is 6 months if stored in 
flat bags made of high density polyethylene at room temperature. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months when stored below 25°C in the 
proposed blisters as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Bioequivalence to the reference product, Ferriprox 500 mg 
film-coated tablets, has been demonstrated. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction 
of Deferiprone Lipomed manufactured by Lipomed is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all Deferiprone containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has presented a non-clinical discussion, including a description of impurities expected and 
their acceptability thresholds which is acceptable. The non-clinical data is reflected in the appropriate 
Assessment report  
EMA/535221/2018  
Page 10/26 
 
 
 
 
 
sections of the SmPC. In line with the requirements for generic products, no new non-clinical data was 
submitted and none is expected. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects are considered acceptable and support the approval of Deferiprone Lipomed 
500 mg film-coated tablets. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing deferiprone. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted 1 bioequivalence study with cross-over design under 
fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
GCP 
The bioequivalence study was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. No other 
clinical trial reports have been submitted in support of this marketing authorisation application. 
Exemption  
This is a generic application for only one strength, hence a biowaiver is not applicable.

single dose crossover trial with administration under fasting conditions to establish comparative 
bioequivalence of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets and Ferriprox 500 mg film-coated 
tablets in 25 healthy, adult, male human subjects under fasting conditions (one subject No. 024 was 
randomised, but dropped out in period I before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication). 
The objectives of the study were: a) to assess bioequivalence of test vs. reference products after single 
dose administration under fasting conditions, determined by use of AUC0-tlast and Cmax obtained for 
deferiprone from plasma concentrations; b) to evaluate safety and tolerability of test and reference 
products considering adverse events observed in the study. One tablet of each product (test and 
reference) were administered. According to data from literature the elimination half-life of deferiprone 
had been determined as 2 to 3 hours. Thus, a wash out period of at least three treatment-free days 
between administrations was sufficient for complete elimination of the active ingredient of the previous 
administered investigational product from the body. 
Test and reference products  
The reference product Ferriprox is approved in the European Union. Samples originated from normal 
production batches. Prior to start of the clinical trial the Reference product was checked with respect to 
the relevant parameters of pharmaceutical quality. 
Population(s) studied 
Twenty-five (25) healthy male subjects, Caucasian, aged ≥ 18 years, were randomised. The mean age 
was 33 years, ranging from 21 to 54 years. 
Total number of subjects (planned and analysed): 24 intended to be randomised, 35 enrolled, 25 
randomised, 25 full analysis set, 23 per protocol set [(1) subject No. 024 was randomised, but dropped 
out in period I before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication; (2) for subject No. 015, blood 
samples No. 3 and 4 (20 min. and 30 min p.a.) could not be withdrawn in period I due to difficulties in

blood sampling]. Since the missing samples were expected to affect the primary parameter Cmax, this 
deviation was classified as major and the subject was excluded from PPS and thus from bioequivalence 
assessment. Intra-individual variability given in the literature determined the CVANOVA for AUC0-inf with 10 
% and Cmax with 19 %. Thus, following a sample size estimation considering an α = 5 %, 1-α = 80 %, a 
product ratio of µT/µR of 0.95 to 1.05 as well as acceptance criteria of 80 % - 125 % for AUC0-t and Cmax, 
20 subjects should have been sufficient. Thus, for safety reasons, a sample size of 24 subjects has been 
chosen for this study. Enrolled subjects formed two population sets. Full analysis set (FAS) defined as all 
subjects randomised. Per protocol set (PPS) defined as all subjects randomised, who finished the clinical 
trial as defined in the clinical trial protocol without major protocol deviations. 
The decision to exclude subject No. 015 was documented on 13 September 2016 (date of the last 
signature) prior to sending the bioanalytical samples to the bioanalytical department as well as to their 
receipt on 14 September 2016 and thus prior to start of bioanalytical measurements. 
The primary evaluation in the per protocol set (N=23) excluding subject no. 015 clearly demonstrated 
bioequivalence between the Test product (Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg) and the Reference product 
(Ferriprox) under single dose fasting conditions in the 23 eligible subjects as presented in the following 
table: 
Parametric point estimates and 90% confidence intervals determined for the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of deferiprone; comparison of Test vs. Reference; excluding 
subject no. 015 
An additional statistical analysis identical to the primary evaluation was conducted including subject no. 
015 (for individual values reference is made to the appendix of the clinical trial report). The results of this 
additional statistical evaluation including subject no. 015 are presented in the following table: 
Parametric point estimates and 90% confidence intervals determined for the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of deferiprone; comparison of Test vs. Reference; including 
subject no. 015 
In summary, inclusion of subject no. 015 in the statistical evaluation does not change the assessment of 
bioequivalence between the Test product (Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg) and the Reference product 
(Ferriprox) under single dose fasting conditions and clearly indicates that the impact of the exclusion of 
subject no. 015 from the primary evaluation is nearly negligible. 
Main inclusion criteria 
Male subjects must fulfilled all the following criteria:

1. sex: male 
2. ethnic origin: Caucasian

Analytical methods 
Deferiprone in plasma samples was analysed by use of a validated method. 
Storage period of study samples  
Blood samples for concentration measurements of deferiprone were collected in 7.5 ml tubes (Lithium 
heparinized tubes) from a vein using an indwelling cannula with switch valve or by direct venipuncture. 
After blood collection lithium heparinized tubes were cooled immediately in an ice bath until 
centrifugation. The samples were centrifuged within 30 min (centrifugation conditions: 2000 x g, 10 min, 
4°C) in order to separate formed elements. The supernatant plasma was divided into two parts and was 
transferred to two clean tubes and subsequently frozen at a temperature below -20°C. Time span 
between blood sampling and freezing of the samples should not have exceeded 60 min. Plasma was 
stored in frozen state at or below -20°C until time of analysis. 
Bioanalytical report 
The bioanalytical report was submitted. Analyses were performed by ACC GmbH Analytical Clinical 
Concepts. The quantification of deferiprone in plasma was performed using a validated method. 
Dosing started on 01.09.2016 and the bioanalysis was performed between 19.09.2016 to 29.09.2016 
(two shipments – 1) 14.09.2016; 2) 21.09.2016). Long term stability was determined for 43 days at 
below-200C. This time span was sufficient as time between withdrawal of first PK sample and last 
analytical measurement did not exceed 15 days. 816 (for 24 subjects) samples were expected according 
to the protocol however 814 blood samples were received. There were 1.6 % haemolysed samples in the 
study (≤ 1 % haemolysis). There were no lipaemic samples in the study. 
According to the Analytical Study Protocol the study samples were to be stored at or below -20 °C at ACC 
GmbH. However, in the time span between receipt and measurement of the study samples the 
temperature increased above -20 °C for about 60 min with the highest temperature being -15.2 °C. As 
stability of deferiprone in plasma was proven for 6 hours at room temperature and for three thaw/freeze 
cycles during method validation, the above mentioned increase of the storage temperature did not affect 
the concentration of deferiprone in the study samples and has therefore no influence on the obtained 
study results. 
In this study the total number of study samples measured was 814. In total 0.2 % of the samples were 
repeated.

Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
In this study, the scheduled total number of subject samples was 816. Incurred sample reanalysis was 
performed on 88 samples (10.8 %). As a criterion of acceptance two thirds of the repeat samples should 
agree within ± 20 %. In total, 94.3 % of the repeat samples agreed within ± 20 %. Therefore, the 
acceptance criteria were fulfilled and incurred sample reanalysis was in accordance with the European 
guideline.  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by means of non-compartmental analysis and were listed and 
evaluated descriptively (number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric 
mean, geometric coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum and maximum) separated by treatment. 
Primary parameters: Cmax, AUC0-tlast  
Secondary parameters: AUC0-∞, AUCexpol%, Clast, tmax, t1/2, tlast, Lz (= λ), tlag of deferiprone. 
Bioequivalence criteria: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed and used as basis for the 
calculation of 90 % confidence intervals; point estimates and confidence intervals for AUC- and 
Cmax-values and the comparison of Test vs. Reference were calculated by parametric analysis. AUC0-tlast 
and Cmax were considered as primary decision criteria for bioequivalence assessment. For parametric 90 
% confidence intervals, acceptance limits of 80.00 % - 125.00 % for AUC0-tlast and Cmax were applied. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analyses were performed as a valid case analysis including all subjects of the per-protocol 
set (no subgroup analysis was planned). Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic means, SD, geometric 
means, geometric CV, medians, minimum, and maximum) were presented for all pharmacokinetic 
parameters. The statistical analyses were carried out on the basis of a multiplicative model for all AUC- 
and Cmax-values. Analyses of variances were performed as pairwise comparison of Test vs. Reference for 
AUC0-tlast, AUC0-∞ and Cmax-values including the factors formulation, period, sequence and subject 
(sequence). Intra-subject variability was estimated and period, subject and sequence effects were 
determined. Affiliated statistical analyses were conducted with α = 0.05. Parametric point and interval 
estimates of Test/Reference ratio were calculated for AUC and Cmax–values. Relative bioavailability of Test 
vs. Reference was assessed by the ratios of geometric means (point estimates). Ninety (90) % confidence 
intervals served as interval estimates and were determined by parametric analysis (two one-sided 
t-tests). Testing for bioequivalence was performed considering the primary target variables (AUC0-tlast and 
Cmax). Decision in favor of bioequivalence was accepted when the parametric 90 % confidence intervals 
did not exceed the limits of 80.00 and 125.00% for the ratio of primary target variables. The decision 
procedure based on 90 % confidence intervals corresponded to two one-sided tests with an error 
probability α= 0.05.  
Also submitted study had data quality assurance procedures established. Methods of detecting outliers, 
corrections of data and missing data handling were established in protocol. This included all activities 
undertaken during and after the clinical trial to verify and control quality. It embraced internal quality 
control by the staff itself and by independent second persons as well as monitoring and separate auditing 
activities. All activities were performed according to written procedures of the MAH and the facilities 
involved.

Results 
Maximum exposure, represented by geometric mean Cmax-values, was quite similar for both products 
with 7020.22 ng/ml for Test and 7153.44 ng/ml for Reference. The ranges of observed Cmax-values were 
similar for both products with 3336.60 ng/ml to 11168.50 ng/ml for Test and 3739.60 ng/ml to 11322.40 
ng/ml for Reference.  
Extent of bioavailability, represented by geometric mean AUC0-tlast-values, was (13263.53 h*ng/ml) for 
Test and (13294.49 h*ng/ml) for Reference. The ranges were 8098.20 to 19812.03 h*ng/ml for Test and 
7901.32 to 21760.13 h*ng/ml for Reference. The mean time points of maximum exposure, represented 
by median values of tmax, were comparable for both treatments (0.67 h for Test and 0.60 h for Reference). 
The latest tmax observed was at 1.67 h after Test and at 1.35 h after Reference. Mean apparent terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) has been calculated with 1.71 h for Test and 1.74 h for Reference and was 
comparable.

Table 3 Parametric point estimates and 90 % confidence intervals determined for the primary 
pharmacokinetic parameters of deferiprone; comparison of Test vs. Reference 
For the primary pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-tlast a point estimate of 99.72 % with an affiliated 
confidence interval of 97.04 – 102.46 % was calculated. For Cmax, which was also defined as primary 
criterion, a point estimate of 97.61 % with an affiliated confidence interval of 87.52 – 108.86 % was 
calculated. Thus, both confidence intervals were within the pre-set acceptance limits of 80.00 – 125.00 
%, and bioequivalence of Test and Reference was demonstrated with regard to AUC0-tlast and Cmax of the 
compound deferiprone. CVANOVA was lower for AUC0-tlast compared to Cmax with values of 5.36 % and 
21.73 %, respectively.

Safety data 
Twenty-four subjects received at least 1 tablet of Test or Reference. One subject No. 024 was 
randomised, but was excluded from the study before receiving at least one dosage of the study 
medication. In the remaining subjects drug exposure was in accordance with the protocol. Twenty-four 
subjects received 1 tablet of Test and Reference each. Therefore, drug exposure was 1 x 500 mg of 
deferiprone in each period. Hence, total dose of each subject was 2 x 500 mg resulting in 1000 mg 
deferiprone in total. 
After study drug intake, 5 subjects showed 7 AEs (according to their MedDRA coded preferred term (PT) 
grouped by system organ class (SOC), intensity and relationship to IMPs); 5 after Test treatment and 2 
after Reference treatment. The most frequent AE, which was reported after study drug intake was 
headache (4 cases). All other AEs occurred only once. In total, 5 out of 7 AEs were classified as study drug 
related. Two of the AEs were classified with no causal relationship to the investigational products. All AEs 
reported after study drug intake resolved completely. No subject dropped out due to AEs.  
Based on the results obtained in the bioequivalence study (EudraCT-No.: 2015-005301-36), the 
Deferiprone 500 Lipomed (Test) and Ferriprox (Reference) in healthy human adult subjects, could be 
judged as bioequivalent.

Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Deferiprone Lipomed is considered bioequivalent with 
Ferriprox. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Deferiprone monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia 
major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. Deferiprone is furthermore 
indicated in combination with another chelator in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy 
with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of 
iron overload justifies rapid or intensive correction. 
To support the application, the Applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study (BE). The BE has been 
performed using the originator; the test product (Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets) and 
the reference product (Ferriprox 500 mg film coated tablets). The reference product Ferriprox is approved 
in the European Union (MA Holder: Apotex Europe B.V., MA number: EU/1/99/108/001). The study has 
been performed under fasting conditions. According to the reference product SmPC recommendation 
(Ferriprox, SmPC), the drug should be taken on an empty stomach.  
According to literature data obtained earlier, mean maximum serum concentrations of approximately 
32.4 (± 13.2) μg/ml were expected after a dose of 1500 mg deferiprone in Thai healthy volunteers. The 
analytical method planned for this clinical trial was intended to allow a LLOQ of 0.20 μg/ml for 
deferiprone. Therefore, deferiprone at dose 500 mg was chosen to achieve sufficient plasma levels to 
characterize the pharmacokinetic profile. 
The methodology related to sample size calculation and statistical evaluation of bioequivalence of two 
products was clearly presented and properly discussed. Parameters chosen for sample size calculations 
were appropriate and in line with the requirements of the guidelines. AUC0-tlast and Cmax were considered 
as primary decision criteria for bioequivalence assessment. Statistical analyses in presented study were 
designed and conducted according to assumptions and recommendations for bioequivalence studies. The 
SAP often referred to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. The methodology related to 
ANOVA modelling and two one-sided test (TOST) was clearly presented and properly discussed. 
Moreover, submitted dossier was implemented with widely described data management procedures and 
data assurance procedures. Presented protocol included list of software to be used to results analyses.  
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the 2 possible treatment sequences according to Latin 
square. Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose samples: within 1.5 h prior to 
dosing; post-dose samples: 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1 h 20 min, 1 h 40 min, 2 h, 2 
h 30 min, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h and 8 h p.a. The sampling periods are acceptable with sample time points 
around tmax for deferiprone and with an adequate wash-out period (at least 3 treatment free days) at 
greater than five times the t1/2 (2-3 hours for deferiprone). The sampling frequency enabled an adequate

estimation of Cmax. The sampling schedule covered the plasma concentration time curve long enough to 
provide a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure. 
Certificates of analysis for both the test and reference products have been provided. Assay values of 
99.5% (497.5 mg) and 100.24% (501.2 mg) for the test and reference are reported respectively. The 
assayed content of the batch used as test product did not differ more than 5% from that of the batch used 
as reference product. The batch size and manufacturing date of the test product have been declared and 
are acceptable.  
Data from literature showed gender-related differences with higher AUC and lower clearance-values in 
females. Inter-individual variability of Cmax seemed to be higher in females. 
Furthermore, as females often suffer from menstruation related iron deficiency anaemia which might 
worsen after intake of study medication and due to the clastogenic and teratogenic properties of the 
deferiprone, females were not intended to participate for safety reasons, too. Thus, only male subjects 
participated in the study. Twenty-five healthy male subjects, Caucasian, aged ≥ 18 years, were 
randomised. The mean age was 33 years, ranging from 21 to 54 years. Total number of subjects (planned 
and analysed): 24 intended to be randomised, 35 enrolled, 25 randomised, 1 drop out, 25 full analysis 
set, 23 per protocol set. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable and performed according to the protocol. All subjects 
are observed and treated according to the same rules. The data from all treated subjects was treated 
equally. The population studied is appropriate and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are in line with 
the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 
01). It appeared that 20 subjects would be sufficient to demonstrate the bioequivalence of Deferiprone 
and Ferriprox. However, bearing in mind that intra-individual variability of AUC and Cmax was established 
in the study with Asian people, a bigger sample size has been was chosen (n=24). That approach is 
accepted. 23 subjects completed the study. 
The analytical method for the determination of deferiprone in human plasma seems to be described 
adequately; the validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA “Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**)”. Acceptance criteria 
are in a plausible range. The analytical methods used are acceptable and appropriate. The calibration 
curves are appropriate and the stability testing supports the conditions the samples were exposed to 
during collection and testing. The Applicant has also provided relevant supportive data together with 
certificates of analysis for the analyte standard and internal standards used in the analytical method 
validation. The relevant SOPs have been provided and deemed valid.  The validation report (Validation of 
determination of deferiprone in plasma samples of subjects) was provided, which contains the requested 
full recovery results. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by means of non-compartmental analysis and were listed and 
evaluated descriptively (number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric 
mean, geometric coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum and maximum) separated by treatment. 
Primary parameters: Cmax, AUC0-tlast. Secondary parameters: AUC0-∞, AUCexpol%, Clast, tmax, t1/2, tlast, Lz (= 
λ), tlag of deferiprone. These parameters were estimated to evaluate bioavailability. 
Bioequivalence criteria: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed and used as basis for the 
calculation of 90 % confidence intervals; point estimates and confidence intervals for AUC- and 
Cmax-values and the comparison of Test vs. Reference were calculated by parametric analysis. AUC0-tlast 
and Cmax were considered as primary decision criteria for bioequivalence assessment. For parametric 90 
% confidence intervals, acceptance limits of 80.00 % - 125.00 % for AUC0-tlast and Cmax were applied. The 
pharmacokinetic variables are adequate. Acceptance range for bioequivalence is 80.00%-125.00% for

90% confidence intervals of the geometric least square means ratio for Cmax and AUC0-tlast of deferiprone. 
This is a conventional approach. The appropriate variables were measured and statistical methodology is 
accepted. The sampling schedule provides adequate estimation of Cmax. Statistical data and a graphical 
representation to cover the plasma concentration time curve long enough to provide an estimate of the 
extent of absorption, has been provided.  
It was observed that maximum exposure, represented by geometric mean Cmax-values, was similar for 
both products with 7020.22 ng/ml for Test and 7153.44 ng/ml for Reference. The ranges of observed 
Cmax-values were similar for both products with 3336.60 ng/ml to 11168.50 ng/ml for Test and 3739.60 
ng/ml to 11322.40 ng/ml for Reference.  
Extent of bioavailability, represented by geometric mean AUC0-tlast-values, was (13263.53 h*ng/ml) for 
Test and (13294.49 h*ng/ml) for Reference, the ranges were 8098.20 to 19812.03 h*ng/ml for Test and 
7901.32 to 21760.13 h*ng/ml for Reference. The mean time points of maximum exposure, represented 
by median values of tmax, were comparable for both treatments (0.67 h p.a. for Test and 0.60 h p.a. for 
Reference). The latest tmax observed was at 1.67 h after test and at 1.35 h after reference. Mean apparent 
terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) has been calculated with 1.71 h for test and 1.74 h for reference and 
was comparable.  
For the primary pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-tlast a point estimate of 99.72 % with an affiliated 
confidence interval of 97.04 – 102.46 % was calculated. For Cmax, which was also defined as primary 
criterion, a point estimate of 97.61 % with an affiliated confidence interval of 87.52 – 108.86 % was 
calculated. Thus, both confidence intervals were within the pre-set acceptance limits of 80.00 – 
125.00 %, and bioequivalence of Test and Reference was demonstrated with regard to AUC0-tlast and Cmax 
of the compound deferiprone. CVANOVA was lower for AUC0-tlast compared to Cmax with values of 5.36 % and 
21.73 %, respectively. 
A total of 25 subjects were evaluated for safety. One subject was randomized, but dropped out in period 
I before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication. A total of 24 subjects were exposed to the 
IMPs. Both products were found to be safe and well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) 
reported in this study. The adverse event was not life threatening or required the subjects to be 
hospitalized.  
After study drug intake, 5 subjects showed 7 AEs -5 after Test treatment and 2 after Reference treatment. 
The most frequent AE, which was reported after study drug intake was headache (4 cases). In total, 5 out 
of 7 AEs were classified as study drug related. Two of the AEs were classified with no causal relationship 
to the investigational products. All AEs reported after study drug intake resolved completely.  
The incidence of AEs reported for the bioequivalence study was moderate. After study drug intake, 5 
subjects showed 7 AEs; 5 after Test treatment and 2 after Reference treatment. All AEs reported after 
study drug intake resolved completely. No subject dropped out due to AEs. There were no serious AEs 
reported. The most frequent AE, which was reported after study drug intake was headache (4 cases). All 
other AEs occurred only once: vision blurred, diarrhoea, nausea. Two cases of headache occurred in 
Test-treated subjects and two cases of headache occurred in Reference-treated subjects. All cases were 
of mild intensity. With regard to the occurrence of headache, there is no difference between Test 
treatment and Reference treatment. 
One case of vision blurred of mild intensity occurred in a Test-treated subject while no case of vision 
blurred occurred in a Reference-treated subject. This case of vision blurred was classified as not related 
to study medication. Due to this classification of relationship and given the very low number of one case 
only, it is not considered that this could represent an actual difference between Test treatment and 
Reference treatment.

One case of diarrhoea of mild intensity occurred in a Test-treated subject while no case of diarrhoea 
occurred in a Reference-treated subject. Given the very low number of one case only, it is not considered 
that this could represent an actual difference between Test treatment and Reference treatment. One case 
of nausea of mild intensity occurred in a Test-treated subject while no case of nausea occurred in a 
Reference-treated subject. Given the very low number of one case only, it is not considered that this could 
represent an actual difference between Test treatment and Reference treatment. 
In general, the tolerability of both Test and Reference medication was completely in accordance with the 
known safety and tolerability profile of the drug substance. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The presented study was designed and conducted according to recommendations of the EMA Guideline on 
the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). The sample size was 
calculated to provide adequate power of bioequivalence analysis and the statistical methodology was 
justified and consistent with the principles of guidelines on the investigation of bioequivalence. Based on 
the results obtained in the bioequivalence study (EudraCT-No.: 2015-005301-36) in healthy male 
subjects, Deferiprone Lipomed (Test) and Ferriprox (Reference) could be judged as bioequivalent.

Pharmacovigilance plan  
Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of this generic product as 
most studies conducted by the MAH of the reference product are already finalized or will be soon finalized 
(2019/2020 USA/Canada).

Routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures. 
Risk minimisation measures 
In line with the reference product the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the 
risks of the product in the proposed indications.  
Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) has already been addressed to the healthcare 
professional by MAH of the reference product in 2006. As no increase of reporting rate of cases of 
agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been identified in the last PSUR of the reference product and the 
risks are well identified, no DHPC is necessary for generics.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.2 is acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ferriprox. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of deferiprone film coated tablets. The reference product 
Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major 
when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. Deferiprone Lipomed in combination 
with another chelator is indicated in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron 
chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload 
justifies rapid or intensive correction. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an 
adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and

considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the 
applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single centre, open-label, randomised (order of 
treatments), balanced, 2-period, 2-sequence, single dose crossover trial with administration under 
fasting conditions to establish comparative bioequivalence of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated 
tablets and Ferriprox 500 mg film coated tablets. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate 
the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice 
of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical 
method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Deferiprone Lipomed met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Ferriprox. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 
80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Deferiprone Lipomed is favourable in the following indication: 
Deferiprone Lipomed monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with 
thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Deferiprone Lipomed in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with 
thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or 
treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload justifies rapid or intensive correction (see 
section 4.2). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

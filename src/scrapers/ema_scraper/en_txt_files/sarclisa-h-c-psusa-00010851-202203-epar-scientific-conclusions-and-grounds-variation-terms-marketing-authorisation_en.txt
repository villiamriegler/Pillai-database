Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for isatuximab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: In view of available data on Tumour Lysis Syndrome from clinical 
trials, the literature, spontaneous reports including in one case a close temporal relationship, and in 
view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Isatuximab 
and tumour lysis syndrome is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product 
information of products containing Isatuximab should be amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for isatuximab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing isatuximab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults (see section 5.1). 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.1). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for 
pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults and 
adolescents at high risk (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be initiated by a physician experienced in the 
management of HIV infection. 
Posology

If a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is missed within 12 hours of the time it is 
usually taken, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be taken as soon as possible and the 
normal dosing schedule should be resumed. If a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is 
missed by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should not be 
taken and the usual dosing schedule should be resumed. 
If vomiting occurs within 1 hour of taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, another tablet 
should be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva a second dose should not be taken. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to emtricitabine and 
tenofovir increases in individuals with renal dysfunction (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Adults with renal impairment 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should only be used in individuals with creatinine clearance 
(CrCl) <80 ml/min if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. See Table 1. 
Table 1: Dosing recommendations in adults with renal impairment 
Mild renal impairment 
(CrCl 50-80 ml/min) 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection 
Limited data from clinical studies 
support once daily dosing (see 
section 4.4).  
Moderate renal 
impairment (CrCl 30-
49 ml/min) 
Severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 30 ml/min) and 
haemodialysis patients 
Administration every 48 hours is 
recommended based on 
modelling of single-dose 
pharmacokinetic data for 
emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil in non-HIV infected 
subjects with varying degrees of 
renal impairment (see section 
4.4). 
Not recommended because 
appropriate dose reductions 
cannot be achieved with the 
combination tablet. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
Limited data from clinical studies 
support once daily dosing in 
HIV-1 uninfected individuals 
with CrCl 60-80 ml/min. Use is 
not recommended in HIV-1 
uninfected individuals with 
CrCl < 60 ml/min as it has not 
been studied in this population 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Not recommended for use in this 
population. 
Not recommended for use in this 
population. 
Paediatrics with renal impairment 
Not recommended for use in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see section 
4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years 
have not been established (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Oral administration. It is preferable that Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is taken with food. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva film-coated tablet can be disintegrated in approximately 
100 ml of water, orange juice or grape juice and taken immediately. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Use for pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with unknown or positive HIV-1 status. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients 
with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation (see section 5.1). 
Overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of 
HIV-1. The time to onset of protection after commencing emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is 
unknown. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should only be used for pre-exposure prophylaxis as part 
of an overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention 
measures (e.g. consistent and correct condom use, knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other 
sexually transmitted infections). 
Risk of resistance with undetected HIV-1 infection 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 
in individuals confirmed to be HIV negative (see section 4.3). Individuals should be re-confirmed to 
be HIV negative at frequent intervals (e.g. at least every 3 months) using a combined antigen/antibody 
test while taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva alone does not constitute a complete regimen for the 
treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-1 resistance mutations have emerged in individuals with undetected 
HIV-1 infection who are only taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil.  
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures 
to HIV-1 are suspected, use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be delayed for at 
least one month and HIV-1 status reconfirmed before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Importance of adherence 
The effectiveness of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is 
strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in blood (see section 
5.1). HIV-1 uninfected individuals should be counselled at frequent intervals to strictly adhere to the 
recommended Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva daily dosing schedule. 
Patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV-1 infected patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an 
increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Physicians should refer to 
current HIV treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis in patients 
with HBV or HCV infection has not been established. 
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary 
of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. See also under Use with ledipasvir and 
sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir below. 
Tenofovir disoproxil is indicated for the treatment of HBV and emtricitabine has shown activity 
against HBV in pharmacodynamic studies but the safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil have not been specifically established in patients with chronic HBV infection. 
Discontinuation of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva therapy in patients infected with HBV 
may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients infected with HBV who 
discontinue Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be closely monitored with both clinical 
and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, 
resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In patients with advanced liver disease or 
cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis 
may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Liver disease 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been established in patients with 
significant underlying liver disorders. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir has been studied in patients 
with hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment is required. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine 
has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on minimal hepatic metabolism and 
the renal route of elimination for emtricitabine, it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required 
for Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
HIV-1 infected patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have 
an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy 
(CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening 
liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
Renal and bone effects in adults 
Renal effects 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular 
filtration and active tubular secretion. Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, 
hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with 
the use of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.8). 
Renal monitoring 
Prior to initiating Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or 
for use in pre-exposure prophylaxis, it is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all 
individuals. 
In individuals without risk factors for renal disease, it is recommended that renal function (creatinine 
clearance and serum phosphate) is monitored after two to four weeks of use, after three months of use 
and every three to six months thereafter. 
In individuals at risk for renal disease more frequent monitoring of renal function is required. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
See also under Co-administration of other medicinal products below. 
Renal management in HIV-1 infected patients 
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in 
any patient receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, renal function should be re-
evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine 
glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should be given to 
interrupting treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in patients with creatinine 
clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l). 
Interrupting treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should also be considered in 
case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Renal safety with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in 
HIV-1 infected patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). Dose interval 
adjustments are recommended for HIV-1 infected patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min (see 
section 4.2). Limited clinical study data suggest that the prolonged dose interval is not optimal and 
could result in increased toxicity and possibly inadequate response. Furthermore, in a small clinical 
study, a subgroup of patients with creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 ml/min who received 
tenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine every 24 hours had a 2-4-fold higher exposure 
to tenofovir and worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). Therefore, a careful benefit-risk 
assessment is needed when Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is used in patients with 
creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min, and renal function should be closely monitored. In addition, the 
clinical response to treatment should be closely monitored in patients receiving 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva at a prolonged dosing interval. The use of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis since 
appropriate dose reductions cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Renal management in pre-exposure prophylaxis 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in HIV-1 uninfected individuals with 
creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min and is therefore not recommended for use in this population. If serum 
phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 60 ml/min in any 
individual receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for pre-exposure prophylaxis, renal 
function should be re evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood 
potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration 
should be given to interrupting use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in individuals with 
creatinine clearance decreased to < 60 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl 
(0.32 mmol/l). Interrupting use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should also be 
considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Bone effects 
Bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia which can manifest as persistent or worsening bone pain 
and, which can infrequently contribute to fractures, may be associated with tenofovir disoproxil-
induced proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8). 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). 
If bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection 
In a 144-week controlled clinical study (GS-99-903) that compared tenofovir disoproxil 
with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small 
decreases in BMD of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in BMD of 
spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this 
group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically 
relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks in this study. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen 
in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease 
inhibitor. Overall in view of the bone abnormalities associated with tenofovir disoproxil and the 
limitations of long-term data on the impact of tenofovir disoproxil on bone health and fracture 
risk,alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are at a 
high risk for fractures. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
In clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, small decreases in BMD were observed. In a study 
of 498 men, the mean changes from baseline to week 24 in BMD ranged from 0.4% to 1.0% across 
hip, spine, femoral neck and trochanter in men who received daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
prophylaxis (n = 247) vs. placebo (n = 251). 
Renal and bone effects in the paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long-term renal and bone effects of tenofovir disoproxil 
during the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population and the long-term renal and bone 
effects of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis in uninfected 
adolescents (see section 5.1). Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity after cessation of tenofovir 
disoproxil for treatment of HIV-1 or after cessation of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-
exposure prophylaxis cannot be fully ascertained.  
A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to weigh the benefit/risk balance of the use of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for pre-exposure 
prophylaxis, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment 
withdrawal) and consider the need for supplementation on a case by case basis. 
When using Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for pre-exposure prophylaxis individuals 
should be reassessed at each visit to ascertain whether they remain at high risk of HIV-1 infection. The 
risk of HIV-1 infection should be balanced against the potential for renal and bone effects with long-
term use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV-1 
infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see sections 4.8 
and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to initiating 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for treatment of HIV-1 or for pre-exposure prophylaxis, 
and should be monitored during use as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including 
measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, 
proximal tubulopathy). If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a 
nephrologist should be obtained to consider interruption of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
use. Interrupting use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should also be considered in case 
of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see Co-administration of other medicinal products 
below). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in individuals under the age of 18 
years with renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal 
impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva use. 
Bone effects 
Use of tenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-
associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are uncertain (see 
section 5.1). 
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected during use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva in any paediatric patient, consultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be 
obtained. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, 
an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Opportunistic infections 
HIV-1 infected patients receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva or any other 
antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced 
in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of 
a nephrotoxic medicinal product (see section 4.5). If concomitant use with nephrotoxic agents is 
unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and 
with risk factors for renal dysfunction. If Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is co-
administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately. 
A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. Close monitoring of 
renal function is required in these patients (see section 4.5). In HIV-1 infected patients with renal risk 
factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be 
carefully evaluated. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with other 
medicinal products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or other 
cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5). Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. 
Use with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and 
voxilaprevir 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, 
especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil when co-administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not 
been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with 
tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions 
related to tenofovir disoproxil. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine 
Co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Triple nucleoside therapy 
There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early 
stage in HIV-1 infected patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine 
and abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. There is close 
structural similarity between lamivudine and emtricitabine and similarities in the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of these two agents. Therefore, the same problems may be seen if 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is administered with a third nucleoside analogue. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in individuals over the age of 65 years. 
Individuals over the age of 65 years are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution 
should be exercised when administering Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to older people. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
As Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any 
interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
The steady-state pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir were unaffected when emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil were administered together versus each medicinal product dosed alone. 
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP450 
mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products 
is low. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with other 
medicinal products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or other 
cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.4). 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir 
dipivoxil. 
Didanosine 
The co-administration of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and didanosine is not 
recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 2). 
Renally eliminated medicinal products 
Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with medicinal products that reduce renal function or 
compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of 
emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
Use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of 
a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, 
amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see 
section 4.4). 
Other interactions 
Interactions between Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva or its individual component(s) and 
other medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no 
change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.” and once daily as “q.d.”). If available, 90% confidence intervals 
are shown in parentheses.

Recommendation concerning 
co-administration with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva (emtricitabine 
200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg) 
Co-administration of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva and didanosine is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Increased systemic exposure to 
didanosine may increase didanosine 
related adverse reactions. Rarely, 
pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, 
sometimes fatal, have been 
reported. Co-administration of 
tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine 
at a dose of 400 mg daily has been 
associated with a significant 
decrease in CD4 cell count, 
possibly due to an intracellular 
interaction increasing 
phosphorylated (i.e. active) 
didanosine. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg didanosine co-administered 
with tenofovir disoproxil therapy 
has been associated with reports of 
high rates of virological failure 
within several tested combinations 
for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. 
Lamivudine and 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva should not be administered 
concomitantly (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment of efavirenz is 
required.

Recommendation concerning 
co-administration with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva (emtricitabine 
200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg) 
Adefovir dipivoxil and 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva should not be administered 
concomitantly (see section 4.4). 
Increased plasma concentrations of 
tenofovir resulting from co-
administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
and atazanavir/ritonavir may 
increase adverse reactions related to 
tenofovir disoproxil, including renal 
disorders. The safety of tenofovir 
disoproxil when used with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. 
ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been 
established. 
The combination should be used 
with caution with frequent renal 
monitoring, if other alternatives are 
not available (see section 4.4).

Recommendation concerning 
co-administration with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva (emtricitabine 
200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg) 
Increased plasma concentrations of 
tenofovir resulting from 
co-administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
and darunavir/ritonavir may 
increase adverse reactions related to 
tenofovir disoproxil, including renal 
disorders. The safety of tenofovir 
disoproxil when used with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
and a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
(e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not 
been established. 
The combination should be used 
with caution with frequent renal 
monitoring (see section 4.4).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. 
Animal studies on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Therefore the use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may be considered 
during pregnancy, if necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient 
information on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants. Therefore 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be used during breast-feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil are available. Animal studies do not 
indicate harmful effects of emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
individuals should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with both 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
HIV-1 infection 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related 
to emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil were nausea (12%) and diarrhoea (7%) in an open-label 
randomised clinical study in adults (GS-01-934, see section 5.1). The safety profile of emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil in this study was consistent with the previous experience with these agents 
when each was administered with other antiretroviral agents. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
No new adverse reactions to emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil were identified from two randomised 
placebo-controlled studies (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients were followed for 
a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. The most frequent adverse reaction reported in the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group in the iPrEx study was headache (1%). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the components 
of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil from clinical study and post-marketing experience in HIV-1 
infected patients are listed in Table 3, below, by body system organ class and frequency. Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies 
are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) 
or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).

1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is not considered to be 
causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. 
2 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine 
was administered to paediatric patients. 
3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised 
controlled clinical studies in adults or paediatric HIV clinical studies for emtricitabine or in randomised 
controlled clinical studies or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program for tenofovir disoproxil. The 
frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed 
to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n = 1,563) or tenofovir disoproxil in randomised 
controlled clinical studies and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal impairment 
As emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is 
recommended (see section 4.4). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after 
tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. However, in some HIV-1 infected patients, declines in creatinine 
clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. Patients at risk of 
renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients 
receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete 
recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
Lactic acidosis 
Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with 
other antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver 
disease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased 
risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal 
outcomes. 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4). 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, 
an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune 
disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, 
the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of 
treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Assessment of adverse reactions related to emtricitabine is based on experience in three paediatric 
studies (n = 169) where treatment-naïve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced (n = 46) paediatric HIV 
infected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents. In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials in paediatric patients than in adults 
(see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse reactions). 
Assessment of adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil is based on two randomised trials 
(studies GS-US 104-0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to 
< 18 years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator 
(n = 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse 
reactions observed in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were 
consistent with those observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected adolescents (aged 12 
to < 18 years), the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower 
than those observed in subjects who received placebo. In HIV-1 infected children (aged 2 to 15 years), 
the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those 
observed in subjects who remained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 
4.4 and 5.1). 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 89 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients with a median age of 7 years (range 
2 to 15 years) were exposed to tenofovir disoproxil for a median of 331 weeks. Eight of the 89 patients 
(9.0%) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory 
findings clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir 
disoproxil therapy. Seven patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 
and 90 ml/min/1.73 m2. Among them, 3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful decline in 
estimated GFR during therapy which improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil. 
Other special populations 
Individuals with renal impairment 
Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended 
in any adults with renal impairment receiving Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). The use of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not recommended in 
individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
HIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients 
The adverse reaction profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in a limited number of HIV-
infected patients in study GS-01-934 who were co-infected with HBV (n = 13) or HCV (n = 26) was 
similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection. However, as would be 
expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the 
general HIV infected population. 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment 
In HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have occurred after 
discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the individual must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and 
standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. 
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by 
haemodialysis. It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal 
dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations, ATC code: J05AR03 
Mechanism of action 
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to 
tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Both 
emtricitabine and tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and 
HIV-2) and hepatitis B virus. 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate 
and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and 
tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. Emtricitabine triphosphate and 
tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain 
termination. 
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Synergistic antiviral activity was observed with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 
vitro. Additive to synergistic effects were observed in combination studies with protease inhibitors, 
and with nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. 
Resistance  
In vitro 
Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development of the 
M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine or the K65R mutation with tenofovir. Emtricitabine-resistant 
viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to 
didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also be selected by abacavir 
or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R 
mutation. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been selected by 
tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and 
tenofovir. HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that 
included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced susceptibility to 
tenofovir disoproxil. 
In vivo – treatment of HIV-1 
In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-naïve patients, genotyping 
was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml 
at weeks 48, 96 or 144 or at the time of early study drug discontinuation. As of week 144:

• 
• 
• 
The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from 
the lamivudine/zidovudine/efavirenz group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher’s Exact test comparing the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all 
patients). 
No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation. 
Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 
13/19 (68%) patients in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in virus from 
21/29 (72%) patients in the comparative group. 
In vivo – pre-exposure prophylaxis 
Plasma samples from 2 clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected subjects, iPrEx and Partners PrEP, were 
analysed for 4 HIV-1 variants expressing amino acid substitutions (i.e. K65R, K70E, M184V, and 
M184I) that potentially confer resistance to tenofovir or emtricitabine. In the iPrEx clinical study, no 
HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or M184I were detected at the time of 
seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 after enrollment in the study. In 3 of 
10 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrollment, M184I and M184V mutations were 
detected in the HIV of 2 of 2 subjects in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group and 1 of 8 
subjects in the placebo group. 
In the Partners PrEP clinical study, no HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or M184I 
were detected at the time of seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 during 
the study. In 2 of 14 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrollment, the K65R mutation 
was detected in the HIV of 1 of 5 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg group and the M184V 
mutation (associated with resistance to emtricitabine) was detected in the HIV of 1 of 3 subjects in the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group. 
Clinical data 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection 
In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934), antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected adult 
patients received either a once daily regimen of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz 
(n = 255) or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudine administered twice daily and efavirenz 
once daily (n = 254). Patients in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil group were given 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz from week 96 to week 144. At baseline the 
randomised groups had similar median plasma HIV-1 RNA (5.02 and 5.00 log10 copies/ml) and CD4 
counts (233 and 241 cells/mm3). The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the achievement 
and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml over 48 weeks. Secondary 
efficacy analyses over 144 weeks included the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA concentrations 
< 400 or < 50 copies/ml, and change from baseline in CD4 cell count. 
The 48-week primary endpoint data showed that the combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil 
and efavirenz provided superior antiviral efficacy as compared with the fixed combination of 
lamivudine and zidovudine with efavirenz as shown in Table 4. The 144 week secondary endpoint 
data are also presented in Table 4.

In a randomised clinical study (M02-418), 190 antiretroviral-naïve adults were treated once daily with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir given once or twice 
daily. At 48 weeks, 70% and 64% of patients demonstrated HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml with the once 
and twice daily regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively. The mean changes in CD4 cell count 
from baseline were +185 cells/mm3 and +196 cells/mm3, respectively. 
Limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with 
emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection 
results in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 – 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see 
section 4.4). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
The iPrEx study (CO-US-104-0288) evaluated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or placebo in 2,499 
HIV uninfected men (or transgender women) who have sex with men and who were considered at high 
risk for HIV infection. Subjects were followed for 4,237 person-years. Baseline characteristics are 
summarised in Table 5.

randomised to either tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil were evaluated for 
detectable plasma tenofovir levels. 
b Substudy participants received active adherence monitoring, e.g. unannounced home visits and pill counts, and 
counselling to improve compliance with study drug. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years 
have not been established. 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population 
There are no clinical studies conducted with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in the paediatric 
population with HIV-1 infection. 
Clinical efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil was established from studies 
conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil when given as single agents. 
Studies with emtricitabine 
In infants and children older than 4 months, the majority of patients taking emtricitabine achieved or 
maintained complete suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% achieved 
≤ 400 copies/ml and 77% achieved ≤ 50 copies/ml). 
Studies with tenofovir disoproxil  
In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years of age 
were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an optimised 
background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir 
disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 24. 
However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data and 
comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). 
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-
score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, 
at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and 
placebo groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil group 
compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir disoproxil group and one 
adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). 
Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined 
by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, 
virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either 
replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original 
regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks. At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
group and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA 
concentrations < 400 copies/ml. The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained 
< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group. When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment 
group had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 
and -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, 
and -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively. The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar 
between the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. 
Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or 
zidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48. BMD 
Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were 
treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and 
weight. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events. Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings 
clinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil 
therapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis in the paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis in 
adolescents who adhere to daily dosing is expected to be similar to that in adults at the same level of 
adherence. The potential renal and bone effects with long-term use of emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents are uncertain (see section 4.4). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioequivalence of one emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil phosphate film-coated tablet with one 
emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule and one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet was 
established following single dose administration to fasting healthy subjects. Following oral 
administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to healthy subjects, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil are rapidly absorbed and tenofovir disoproxil is converted to tenofovir. Maximum 
emtricitabine and tenofovir concentrations are observed in serum within 0.5 to 3.0 h of dosing in the 
fasted state. Administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with food resulted in a delay of 
approximately three quarters of an hour in reaching maximum tenofovir concentrations and increases 
in tenofovir AUC and Cmax of approximately 35% and 15%, respectively, when administered with a 
high fat or light meal, compared to administration in the fasted state. In order to optimise the 
absorption of tenofovir, it is recommended that emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should preferably be 
taken with food. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was 
approximately 1.4 l/kg and 800 ml/kg, respectively. After oral administration of emtricitabine or 
tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body. In vitro 
binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over 
the range of 0.02 to 200 μg/ml. In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was 
less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 μg/ml. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes 
oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro 
studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 
enzymes. Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of 
the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation. Also, emtricitabine did not 
inhibit uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in 
urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  
13% of the emtricitabine dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of 
emtricitabine averaged 307 ml/min. Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of 
emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. 
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system 
with approximately 70 – 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous 
administration. The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 ml/min. Renal 
clearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 ml/min, which is in excess of the glomerular 
filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of 
tenofovir. Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 
12 to 18 hours. 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine or tenofovir (administered as 
tenofovir disoproxil) in the elderly (over 65 years of age). 
Gender 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female patients. 
Ethnicity 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified 
for emtricitabine. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) have not 
been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children 
and adolescents (under 18 years of age). Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 
8 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-
1 infected children aged 2 to < 12 years. Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients 
receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir 
disoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving 
once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed 
with tenofovir disoproxil in children under 2 years.  
In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, children and adolescents (aged 4 months 
up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults.  
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) are 
expected to be similar in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adolescents based on the similar exposures of 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emtricitabine and tenofovir in HIV-1 infected adolescents and adults, and the similar exposures of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adults. 
Renal impairment 
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for emtricitabine and tenofovir after co-administration of 
separate preparations or as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in patients with renal impairment. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were mainly determined following administration of single doses of 
emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected subjects with varying 
degrees of renal impairment. The degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline 
creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function when CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild impairment with 
CrCl = 50 – 79 ml/min; moderate impairment with CrCl = 30 – 49 ml/min and severe impairment with 
CrCl = 10 – 29 ml/min). 
The mean (%CV) emtricitabine drug exposure increased from 12 (25%) μg·h/ml in subjects with 
normal renal function, to 20 (6%) μg·h/ml, 25 (23%) μg·h/ml and 34 (6%) μg·h/ml, in subjects with 
mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
The mean (%CV) tenofovir drug exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with 
normal renal function, to 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml, in 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
The increased dose interval for emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected patients 
with moderate renal impairment is expected to result in higher peak plasma concentrations and lower 
Cmin levels as compared to patients with normal renal function.  
In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug 
exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 (19%) μg·h/ml of emtricitabine, and over 48 
hours to 42,857 (29%) ng·h/ml of tenofovir. 
A small clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of 
tenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine in HIV infected patients with renal impairment. 
A subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 ml/min, receiving once 
daily dosing, had a 2 – 4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure and worsening renal function. 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) in 
paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied. No data are available to make dose 
recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied in subjects with 
hepatic impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency. In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected 
subjects were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients. 
A single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) classification. 
Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment 
suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects. The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and 
AUC0 – ∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, in normal subjects 
compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Emtricitabine 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies 
of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. 
Tenofovir disoproxil  
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no special hazard for humans. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and 
a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) 
and reduced BMD (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at 
exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile 
infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the exposure 
in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-related 
decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. 
Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results 
in one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat 
hepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. 
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a 
peri and postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. 
Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
Genotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity studies of one month or less with the combination of these 
two components found no exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to studies with the separate 
components.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is and what it is used for 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains two active substances, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil. Both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to 
treat HIV infection. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a 
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they work 
by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the 
virus to reproduce itself.  
• 
• 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus 1(HIV-1) infection, in adults. 
It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 
35 kg, and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective 
or have caused side effects.  
• 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should always be used combined with other 
medicines to treat HIV infection.  
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can be administered in place of emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses. 
• 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.  
• 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is also used to reduce the risk of getting HIV-1 
infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, 
when taken daily, together with safer sex practices: 
See section 2 for a list of precautions to take against HIV infection. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of 
getting HIV if you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. 
Before taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can only help reduce your risk of getting HIV before you 
are infected. 
• 
You must be HIV negative before you start to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva to reduce the risk of getting HIV. You must get tested to make sure that you do not 
already have HIV infection. Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce 
your risk unless you are confirmed to be HIV negative. People who do have HIV must take 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in combination with other medicines.  
•  Many HIV tests can miss a recent infection. If you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you 
have recently been infected with HIV. 
These may be signs of HIV infection: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
fever 
joint or muscle aches 
headache 
vomiting or diarrhoea 
rash 
night sweats 
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin 
Tell your doctor about any flu-like illness – either in the month before starting 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, or at any time while taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. 
Warnings and precautions 
While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
• 
Take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva every day to reduce your risk, not just when 
you think you have been at risk of HIV infection. Do not miss any doses 
of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, or stop taking it. Missing doses may increase 
your risk of getting HIV infection. 
• 
• 
Get tested for HIV regularly. 
If you think you were infected with HIV, tell your doctor straight away. They may want to do 
more tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. 
•  Just taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may not stop you getting HIV. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Always practice safer sex. Use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, 
or blood. 
Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as 
toothbrushes and razor blades. 
Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.  
Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea.  
These infections make it easier for HIV to infect you. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ask your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting HIV or spreading HIV 
to other people. 
While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of 
getting HIV: 
• 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may affect your kidneys. Before and during 
treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. Tell your doctor if you 
have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney problems. If you have 
kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva or, if you already have HIV, to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva less 
frequently. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not recommended if you have severe 
kidney disease or are on dialysis. 
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was 
seen in clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor.  
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.  
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are at a 
higher risk of fractures. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients 
infected with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are 
treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. 
If you have hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for 
you.  
Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. If you have HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop 
taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, whether or not you also have HIV. It is 
important not to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva without talking to your 
doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65. The combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil has not been studied in patients over 65 years of age. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not for use in children under 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva if you are already taking other medicines 
that contain the components of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine 
or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with other medicines that can damage your 
kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, 
including 
• 
• 
• 
• 
aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection). 
amphotericin B (for fungal infection). 
foscarnet (for viral infection). 
ganciclovir (for viral infection). 
51 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
pentamidine (for infections). 
vancomycin (for bacterial infection). 
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer). 
cidofovir (for viral infection). 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). 
If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may 
order blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. 
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. 
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with other medicines containing didanosine 
(for treatment of HIV infection): Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with other 
antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may 
reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in 
the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported when medicines containing tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat 
you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with food and drink 
Whenever possible, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be taken with food. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you have taken Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva during your pregnancy, your doctor may 
request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. 
In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV 
outweighed the risk of side effects. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
This is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk. 
Breast-feeding  is  not  recommended  in  women  living  with  HIV  because  HIV  infection  can  be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. 
If  you  are  breast-feeding,  or  thinking  about  breast-feeding,  you  should  discuss  it  with  your 
doctor as soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy while taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3.  How to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
• 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to treat HIV is: 
• 
• 
Adults: one tablet each day, where possible, with food. 
Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day, 
whenever possible with food. 
The recommended dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce the risk of 
getting HIV is: 
• 
• 
Adults: one tablet each day, whenever possible, with food. 
Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day, 
whenever possible with food. 
If you have difficulty swallowing, you can use the tip of a spoon to crush the tablet. Then mix the 
powder with about 100 ml (half a glass) of water, orange juice or grape juice, and drink immediately. 
• 
• 
• 
Always take the dose recommended by your doctor. This is to make sure that your medicine 
is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. Do not change 
the dose unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you are being treated for HIV infection, your doctor will prescribe Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva with other antiretroviral medicines. Please refer to the patient information 
leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines. 
If you are taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce the risk of getting HIV, 
take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva every day, not just when you think you have 
been at risk of HIV infection. 
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to prevent getting HIV or prevent spreading 
HIV to other people. 
If you take more Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva than you should 
If you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva, contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with 
you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
It is important not to miss a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
• 
• 
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva, take the tablet preferably with food as soon as possible. Then take the next dose at your 
usual time. 
If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva, forget about the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose, preferably with 
food, at your usual time.  
If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, take 
another tablet. You do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
• 
• 
If you take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva for treatment of HIV infection, stopping 
tablets may reduce the effectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your doctor.  
If you are taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to reduce the risk of getting HIV, do 
not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva or miss any doses. Stopping use of 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, or missing doses, may increase your risk of getting 
HIV infection. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva without contacting your 
doctor. 
If you have hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for 
several months after stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, 
stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which 
may be life-threatening. 
Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Possible serious side effects:  
• 
Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in 
people with liver disease. The following may be signs of lactic acidosis: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
deep rapid breathing, 
drowsiness, 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), 
stomach pain. 
If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately. 
• 
• 
Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) 
and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune 
system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
anti-HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in 
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms. 
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as: 
• 
• 
• 
muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. 
If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help immediately. 
Possible side effects: 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea),  
• 
dizziness, headache, 
• 
rash, 
• 
feeling weak. 
Tests may also show: 
• 
• 
decreases in phosphate in the blood, 
increased creatine kinase. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
pain, stomach pain, 
difficulty sleeping, abnormal dreams, 
problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, feeling bloated, flatulence, 
rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), 
which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin 
in patches, 
other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed. 
•

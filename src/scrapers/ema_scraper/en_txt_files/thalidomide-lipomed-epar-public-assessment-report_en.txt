2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for marketing authorisation concerns a ‘hybrid’ application, change in strength, to a 
centrally authorised medicinal product according to Art. 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, 
supported by published data and a bioequivalence study. The application refers to the reference 
product, Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg, capsule, hard, from Celgene Europe B.V. Netherlands (currently 
known as Thalidomide BMS, from Bristol-Myers Squibb). The eligibility of Thalidomide Lipomed was 
confirmed in July 2020. 
The community marketing authorisation of the reference has been granted on 16 April 2008 under 
number EU/1/08/443/001.  
The applicant has developed Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablet as hybrid to the reference 
medicinal product, Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg capsule. The difference from the reference product 
consists of the change in the strength.  
The indications, posology and pharmacology as presented in the proposed SmPC are in line with the 
originator product’s SmPC.   
Therapeutic indication 
Thalidomide Lipomed in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated as first line treatment 
of patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy. 
Thalidomide Lipomed is prescribed and dispensed in accordance with the Thalidomide Lipomed 
Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as coated tablets containing 100 mg of thalidomide as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 9/53 
 
  
 
 
 - in tablet core: lactose  monohydrate, copovidone (E 1208), talc (E 553b), magnesium stearate (E 
470b), microcrystalline cellulose [E 460(i)],  
 - in coating layer: heavy kaolin (E 559), sucrose, acacia (E 414), calcium carbonate (E 170), talc (E 
553b), titanium dioxide (E 171). 
The product is available in PVC-Al blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of thalidomide is 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C13H10N2O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 258.23 g/mol 
and the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The structure of the active substance (AS) has been elucidated by a combination of IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 
13C-NMR, mass spectroscopy (MS), and elemental analysis. 
Thalidomide is white to almost white non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in 
water, ethanol, methanol and chloroform. 
Thalidomide has one chiral centre, derived from glutamic acid. However, this stereogenic centre has 
exacerbated lability and is easily epimerized in the reaction conditions used. This lability is related to 
the presence of the carbonyl and imide groups at the stereogenic centre position α. Therefore, it can 
exist as two enantiomers: R and S. The specific optical rotation specification proposed is consistent 
with the preparation of a racemic product. 
Thalidomide exists in two crystal forms: α and β as shown by x-rays analysis. 
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance (AS) is produced by chemical synthesis. The manufacturing process consists of 
two steps (the reaction step and the purification step) with one isolated intermediate. The typical 
thalidomide batch size has been stated. Following a Major Objection (MO) raised by the CHMP, the 
selection of the starting materials has been justified according to the guidelines and information has 
been provided confirming they are sufficiently controlled. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the AS has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Thalidomide is crystallised as ß polymorph form; A test for the identification of the polymorphic form 
has been included in the AS specification.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 10/53 
 
  
 
 
 
Critical process parameters are clearly identified and adequate justified by the ASMF holder. Appropriate 
in-process controls were presented. Information about re-processing is provided. 
Specifications for all other materials used in the manufacturing process have been provided, together 
with description of the analytical methods and certificates of analysis. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic impurities 
were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
During the procedure an MO was raised by the CHMP requesting a complete synthetic scheme including 
also the purification step as per the Guideline on the chemistry of active substances 
EMA/454576/2016) and demonstration that impurities from starting materials and other raw materials 
are not carried over into the final AS. The applicant provided the updated synthetic scheme and 
discussed the potential impurities from the starting materials as requested. It was concluded that the 
impurities from starting materials that might potentially be carried over into the final active substance 
are sufficiently addressed by the existing control strategy and that no further controls are necessary. It 
has been demonstrated that the impurities are adequately controlled during manufacturing of the 
active substance. The MO was thus resolved. 
The manufacturing process of thalidomide was validated on three commercial batches.  
The AS is packaged in a container closure system for which a brief description and specifications were 
provided. Certificates of analysis for the packaging materials have been presented. The materials 
comply with the relevant European requirements.  
2.2.2.2.  Specification 
The active substance specification applied by the finished product manufacturer includes appropriate 
tests and limits for appearance (visual), identity (IR, UV), colour of test solution (Ph. Eur.), loss on 
drying (Ph. Eur.), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particle size distribution 
(laser diffraction, Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).  
Test parameters and acceptance criteria are in accordance with the ICH Q6A guideline and in line with 
general pharmaceutical practice and experience. Impurities limits are in-line with the ICH Q3A and 
limits for residual solvents were established on the basis of actual data and comply with ICH Q3C 
requirements. Assay limits derive from the current USP monograph for thalidomide; there is no Ph. 
Eur. Monograph. Inorganic (elemental) impurities are controlled by the AS manufacturer.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analytical data are provided by the manufacturer of active substance for three commercial scale 
batches  and  relevant  CoAs  have  been  presented.  The  batches  showed  compliance  with  the  proposed 
specification.  
2.2.2.3.  Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance stored in the intended 
commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH),  intermediate 
storage condition (30°C, 65% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C, 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided by the finished product manufacturer.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 11/53 
 
  
 
 
Samples were tested for appearance, colour of test solution, loss on drying, impurities, assay, particle 
size distribution and microbiological quality. Results obtained under all storage conditions met the 
specification at all timepoints; no trends were observed.  
Additional stability data on another nine full scale thalidomide batches stored in the intended 
commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were also 
provided by the AS manufacturer in the provided ASMF. 
Samples  were  tested  for  the  following  parameters:  description,  color,  identification,  loss  on  drying, 
optical  rotation,  impurities,  assay,  microbiological  tests  according  to  the  ASMF  holder  specifications. 
Results complied with the specifications.  
Three active substance batches were submitted to photostability studies as per ICH guideline. From the 
results obtained, it is concluded that thalidomide is not photosensitive, since no significant change was 
observed before and after exposure to light. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed under stress conditions of heat (80°C) , heat and 
acidic treatment, heat and alkaline treatment, UV radiation, heat and oxidation treatment, heat in 
water as part of the validation of the impurities testing method, to demonstrate that the method is 
stability indicating. Varying degree of degradation was observed ranging from no degradation under 
heat at 80°C, to almost complete degradation under heat and alkaline treatment.  
Based on the overall presented stability results, the proposed retest period of 36 months without 
special storage conditions is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is immediate release coated tablets containing 100 mg of thalidomide 
intended for oral use. The finished product is presented as white, round, domed sugar-coated tablets 
with diameter approx. 10.2 mm and thickness approx. 5.5 mm.  
The finished product has been developed as a hybrid of the reference medicinal product Thalidomide 
Celgene 50 mg capsules, hard. The application was submitted in accordance with Art. 10(3) hybrid 
application (change in strength –quantitative change to the active substance). Consequently, the 
objective was to prepare coated tablets essentially similar to the reference medicinal product.  
The active substance, thalidomide, is known, but is not described in the Ph. Eur. It is a stable 
compound and no special precaution had to be implemented during the development of the FP 
manufacturing process. However it is practically insoluble in water, and therefore development was 
focused on aspects like dissolution of the AS from the tablets and the bioequivalence vs the reference 
product, particle size and polymorphism. It has been shown that the AS crystalline form α does not 
change significantly during storage of the active substance.  
The FP consists of a tablet core and sugar-coating. The core composition is a classical mix of standard 
excipients chosen to guarantee an immediate and complete release of the active substance. The 
excipients show no compatibility issues with the AS as attested by the long-term stability studies. 
Based on the distribution and the absorption from the digestive tract determined by the chemical 
properties of the AS itself, no development of the core composition were presented. The 
pharmaceutical form of coated tablets with sugar coating was chosen so that skin contact with the AS 
and the risks associated with the highly teratogenic AS are reduced.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 12/53 
 
  
 
 
The formulation was based on the manufacturer experience who developed the product since 2001. The 
documentation has since been updated in order to demonstrate compliance to the current requirements 
of EU legislation.  
Since the coated tablets were found to be in conformity with the set specifications and showed a 
reproducible dissolution profile that fulfils the requirements for immediate release tablets, no further 
formulation development has been performed. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance 
and excipients properties impacted by changes on formulation or manufacturing process and risk 
assessment in formulation and process variables were not discussed, but were justified based on 
historical development since 2001 and this was accepted.  
A discussion about the qualitative formulation vis-a-vis the reference product, and justification of the 
pharmaceutical form of the test versus the reference medicinal product was presented. The 
composition of the FP was presented properly including components, its functions and references to 
standards. Considering also that the FP is a simple immediate release formulation, with common 
excipients used in many similar pharmaceutical products the level of information regarding the 
pharmaceutical development is considered sufficient. 
All excipients used in the FP are well known, widely used as pharmaceutical excipients and comply with 
relevant pharmacopoeial monographs. There is no novel constituent used in the formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
The main steps of the manufacturing process were summarised. The manufacturing process 
development identified any critical process parameters that should be monitored or controlled to 
ensure that the product is of the desired quality. Satisfactory information regarding the optimisation of 
the process parameters were presented. Regarding the coating step, information on development of 
this step, characteristics of the solutions used for coating and their physical characteristics was 
provided. 
A  summary  of  formulations  used  in  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  and  in  any  relevant  bioavailability  or 
bioequivalence studies was also provided. There are no differences in the manufacturing processes of 
the commercial product and clinical trial materials. 
The development of the dissolution method was based on the physico-chemical characteristics of the 
active substance and the intended dose range of the formulation. Following a MO raised during the 
procedure about the development of the dissolution method and the associated specification limit, the 
applicant further justified the choice of the proposed method by providing additional information and 
literature references. As part of the response same MO the initially proposed dissolution specification 
limit was tightened in line with the “Reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic solid 
oral immediate release products with systemic action” (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017). The 
revised dissolution acceptance criterion is acceptable. The provided information was satisfactory and 
the MO was resolved. 
The discriminatory power of the proposed QC dissolution method was sufficiently by varying physical 
characteristics of AS and composition of tablets.  
The applicant submitted a relative bioavailability study (refer to clinical section of the report) in order 
to demonstrate bioequivalence between the test and reference product. Some comparative dissolution 
results had been presented initially. However the CHMP requested in a MO the results of the 
comparative in vitro dissolution testing of the batches used in the bioequivalence study at three 
different buffers over the complete physiological pH range ( pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) without surfactant in 
line with the relevant guideline and the recommendation given during the received CHMP scientific 
advice. In their response the applicant provided the requested data. The dissolution profiles were 
found non similar but the differences were explained as per the bioequivalence guideline. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 13/53 
 
  
 
 
In addition the comparative in vitro dissolution testing of one Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated 
tablet against two reference product 50 mg hard capsules showed no similarity in tested pH media 
based on ƒ2 values. Considering the high relative standard deviation(RSD) values the ƒ2 statistical 
method is not suitable and the confidence intervals for ƒ2 calculation based on 90% confidence interval 
with the Bootstrap method would have been recommended. However, the issue was not further 
pursued because as per the bioequivalence guideline the in vivo results prevail and in vitro similarity 
studies are only complementary to the bioavailability study. Thus the MO was considered resolved. 
The finished product is packed into blister strips consisting of PVC foil and aluminium foil with heat-
sealing lacquer. This container closure system is considered to be suitable for storage, since it 
guarantees adequate tightness and since no incompatibility between the container closure system and 
the coated tablets are registered. Specifications, analytical methods, certificates of analysis, IR spectra 
were provided for all components of the primary packaging and bulk packaging have been provided. 
The primary packaging PVC – aluminium blister complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 
10/2011.  
For the bulk package flat bags made of high-density polyethylene specification and certificate of 
analysis were also provided and a declaration of compliance with the Commission Regulation (EU) No 
10/2011. 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Thalidomide Lipomed 100mg coated tablets takes place in two clearly 
stated manufacturing sites. 
The manufacturing process for the coated tablets consists of the following main steps: weighing of raw 
materials, granulation, drying of the granulate, sieving of the dry granulate, addition and mixing of 
talc, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose, compression of the tablet cores and sugar 
coating of the tablet cores. This is a standard manufacturing process. 
Narrative description for each step was presented and batch size were stated. Process parameters 
were included in the description of the manufacturing process. The parameters of the critical steps of 
the manufacturing process are monitored during standard production. The proposed in-process 
controls and the tests at the time of batch release guarantee that the product is in compliance with its 
specifications. 
An ambiguity in the original documentation led the CHMP to raise a MO requesting the applicant to 
clarify  the product manufacturing flow between the two sites and clarify whether the presented 
process validation data covers both sites. The applicant in their response provided additional 
information and clarifications. Regarding process validation, data on a minimum of 3 consecutive 
batches was provided according to Annex 1 on the Guideline on process validation for finished products 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/749073/2016. Moreover it was confirmed that process validation studies cover all 
manufacturing steps used for the production of the marketed product in both manufacturing sites. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Based on the 
response the manufacturing process (standard process) was considered sufficiently validated and the 
MO was resolved.  
Overall, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 14/53 
 
  
 
 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance (visual), shape (visual), diameter and thickness (calliper rule), average mass (gravimetry), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur. - HPLC), identity of AS (HPLC, UV), identity of colouring agent TiO2 (ICP-AES), 
assay (HPLC), ethanol (GC), resistance to crushing (Ph. Eur.),  content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), impurities 
(HPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The FP specifications have been updated during the procedures and now include specific tests required 
in the relevant guidelines and the Ph. Eur. Monograph for the dosage form. Impurities limits are in line 
with ICH Q3B. The proposed tests and limits are considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. It could be shown 
that the risk of a carry-over of elemental impurities is very low. The concentration of all elemental 
impurities is far below the 30% threshold of the permitted daily intake according to ICH Q3D. Thus it 
has been concluded that no additional controls are required in the finished product specification. 
A risk evaluation on the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was provided in line 
with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion 
for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of 
Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk of possible presence 
of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product was identified. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. The nitrosamines risk evaluation 
report is considered acceptable.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. The finished product is released on the market 
based on the above release specifications through traditional finished product release testing. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on three commercial scale batches manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturers. All the test results were within the proposed specification limits 
demonstrating the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from eight commercial scale batches stored for up to 60 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% RH) and for up to six months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
stability batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities and dissolution, for all batches at all time points. 
In three of those baches hardness and disintegration were also tested. The analytical procedures used 
are  stability  indicating.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  are  stability 
indicating. The results met the specifications valid at the time. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 15/53 
 
  
 
 
A photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B on one commercial scale batch. All 
results of appearance, assay and impurities are within specifications, no impurities have been detected, 
therefore the FP is considered to be photostable. 
One batch of the product was stored as bulk (coated tablets prior to blistering) in the flat bags made of 
high-density polyethylene, the container described in Section 3.2.P.7, at 25°C/60% RH for a period of 
36 months. All results are within specifications. Based on these results, it has been established that bulk 
coated tablets may be kept in flat bags made of high-density polyethylene for a maximum period of 36 
months prior to blistering. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 5 years without any special storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is the only material of animal origin used for Thalidomide Lipomed. It is 
confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance (AS) and the finished 
product (FP) has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The information about the active substance 
has been provided in the form of ASMF. A MO concerning the selection of the starting materials for the 
synthesis of the AS has been resolved according to the guidelines and additional information about the 
applied controls. 
The finished product Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablets was developed as a hybrid of 
Thalidomide Celgene 50mg capsules. An MO that had been raised about the development and the 
specification limit for the dissolution testing of the finished product has been resolved by provision of 
additional information and justifications and by tightening the specification limit in line with existing 
guidance. Another MO in relation to  the in vitro dissolution studies in support of the bioequivalence 
study has been resolved by additional information as per the relevant guideline. The last MO concerned 
the involved manufacturing sites and the respective process validation study; this has been resolved 
by additional information confirming adherence to the respective guideline. Overall, during the 
procedure the information of the dossier has been updated and improved as requested. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
No new studies have been submitted. This is acceptable taking into account the type of application and

No  new  studies  have  been  performed.  Thalidomide  Lipomed  is  a  generic/hybrid  medicinal  product  of 
Thalidomide  Celgene,  approved  through  centralized  procedure.  The  difference  between  products  is 
represented by the difference in strength (50 mg for Thalidomide Celgene and 100 mg for Thalidomide 
Lipomed).  Moreover,  thalidomide  is  a  well-known  active  substance  with  an  established  PK  profile. 
EMA/773068/2022

Therefore, the applicant´s approach regarding the submission of only bibliographic data publicly available 
is suitable and adequate. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No  new  studies  have  been  performed.  The  applicant´s  approach  regarding  the  submission  of  only 
bibliographic data publicly available is suitable and adequate taking into account that the toxicological 
profile of thalidomide is well-known. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No new studies have been performed. The applicant´s approach regarding the submission of only 
bibliographic data publicly available is suitable and adequate taking into account that the toxicological 
profile of thalidomide is well-known. 
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No  new  studies  have  been  performed.  The  applicant’s  approach  regarding  the  submission  of  only 
bibliographic data publicly available is suitable and adequate taking into account that the toxicological 
profile of thalidomide is well-known. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg capsules do not represent a risk to the environment primarily due to the 
calculated PECSURFACEWATER for thalidomide is below the 0.01 μg/l guideline threshold concentration. 
In support of this statement, the applicant performed a Phase I ERA. 
In accordance to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr2), the applicant calculated PECsurfacewater as follows: 
It is noticed that PECsurfacewater exceeds 0.01 µg/l, the accepted value in the currently used ERA 
guidance. Therefore, the applicant refined Fpen based on prevalence data and treatment regimen, in 
accordance to Q&A on the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/44609/2010, Rev.1). 
The determined value of PECsurfacewater based on the formula mentioned in the Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, Corr 
2) is PECsurfacewater= 0.0000313 x 200/200 X10 X 1000. Therefore, the determined value of 0.0031 
µg/L is well below the value stipulated in the currently used ERA guideline, respectively 0,01 µg/l.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview is based on published literature data. This is acceptable since thalidomide is 
well known active substance and with extensive experience in clinical setting. There are no new non 
clinical studies performed in support of the proposed application hence the presented Non-clinical 
Overview is considered sufficient for this type of MAA. No issue has been raised regarding the 
impurities and residual solvents found in drug substance/drug product from toxicological point of view. 
Section 4.6 (Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation) and the Preclinical safety data (section 5.3) contained 
in the proposed SmPC for Thalidomide Lipomed reflects the characteristics of the substances and are 
completely in line with the reference medicinal product Thalidomide Celgene approved through 
centralized procedure (EMEA/H/C/000823). 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 19/53 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant performed a Phase I ERA and provided supplementary PK data, taking into account that 
thalidomide is a known human teratogen. These data support the fact that Thalidomide Lipomed is 
unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in elderly patients with 
multiple myeloma. Two queries have been identified at Day 120. In the ERA assessment the 
prevalence data initially presented were not accurate. The applicant was referring to new cases in 2018 
but when accessing the links (facts-sheets) below the table then numbers given seem to be from 2020. 
As requested, the applicant provided adequate data. It can be considered that this question is 
considered solved. Initially, logKow has been provided based on the scientific literature publicly 
available. Following the assessment question, the applicant provided suitable and reliable information 
on an experimentally derived n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) for the active ingredient in 
order to assess the PBT potential, in accordance with the Q&A document by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) Questions and answers on 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use' (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical information provided is considered adequate to support the approval. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study. 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

Characterisation of relative bioavailability of a newly developed thalidomide formulation (100 mg) in 
comparison with a marketed reference product (2x50 mg) 
Methods 
•  Study design  
This was a single centre, open-label, randomised, balanced, 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover, single 
dose trial in healthy adult volunteers under fasting conditions. 
Duration of the study:  
Study initiation date (first subject enrolled): 09.07.2020 
Study completion date ((last subject completed): 18.08.2020 
Washout period: at least 03 days between dosing of each period 
Subjects enrolled in the study were dosed on the following dates: 
Period 1: on 20.07.2020 subjects 001 – 017 and on 23.07.2020 subjects 018 - 034 
Period 2: on 26.07.2020 subjects 001 – 017 and on 29.07.2020 subjects 018 – 034 
Site and dates of the study 
Approval of the IEC and BfarM of the study protocol, amendment 02, final of the study protocol dated 
02.07.2020 and approval of the Informed Consent (Version Number V01, final) by the have been 
provided as requested at Day 120.  
The final clinical study report is dated 28.01.2021.  
The treatments were defined as follows: 
T: single oral fasted administration of 1 coated tablet of Test (Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated 
tablet manufactured by Lipomed GmbH, Germany.  
R: single oral fasted administration of 2 hard capsules of Reference (Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard 
capsule MAH Celgene Europe B.V., Netherlands. taken simultaneously 
Allocation of treatment sequence for each subject in each study period was carried out as per the 
randomisation schedule:

After an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, subjects were administered orally either two hard capsules 
of Thalidomide Celgene (Reference) or one coated tablet of Thalidomide Lipomed (Test) as per 
randomisation schedule. The hard capsules and tablets were administered with 240 ml tap water in an 
upright position. 
Standardised meals were provided in the evening of pre-administration day (i.e. study day -1) and on 
the day of administration of the IMP subjects received standardised meals 4, 7, 9 and 12 hours after 
dosing in each period. Water was restricted from 01 hour prior to dosing until 01 hour post-dose, 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 21/53 
 
  
 
 
except 240 ml tap water given during dosing. From 01 hour until 10 hours after dosing 150 ml of non-
carbonated water were given every hour, i.e. 150 ml were given ten times. After this interval fluid 
intake of non-carbonated water was ad libitum.  
The design of the study is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 01 – January 2010); therefore, it is considered 
appropriate.  
The test and the reference products are immediate release formulation; thus, a single dose 
bioequivalence study is appropriate. 
According to the SmPC the reference product should be taken as a single dose at bedtime due to 
sedative effects. While absorption is delayed in fed state the overall extent of absorption is not altered. 
Thus, the bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions is acceptable. 
The blood sampling for the assessment of thalidomide in plasma were collected pre-dose (within 1.0 
hour prior to dosing) and post-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.33, 2.66, 3, 3.33, 3.66, 4, 
4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours. Frequent sampling was planned around the 
expected tmax (1-5 hours).  
Considering the median tmax at 2 hours post-dose, the sampling period and the sampling scheme 
seems adequate to estimate the primary PK parameters of thalidomide.  
Since AUC0-tlast covers at least 80% of AUC0-∞, the sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration 
time curve long enough. Tmax was not observed in any subject in the first sample time point.  
The mean apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of thalidomide was approximately 5.70 
hours, thus the washout period of at least 03 days is more than five half-life of the active substance. 
This is considered appropriate to exclude a carry-over effect.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 22/53 
 
  
 
 
 
Table 2. Test and reference products   
The reference product Thalidomide Celgene is approved in the European Union. Samples originated 
from normal production batches. The choice of the reference product is appropriate.  
Certificates of analysis have been provided and the difference in content of active substance between 
reference and test product is less than 5.0%. 
•  Population(s) studied   
A total of 40 healthy, adult, male subjects have been enrolled in the clinical trial, from which 34 have 
been randomised (Caucasian race, mean age 36.6±10.4 years, mean height 1.815±0.069 m, mean 
weight 84.40±11.67 kg, mean BMI 25.53±2.47 kg/m2). All randomised subjects were non-smokers or 
ex-smokers since at least 6 months. The study population was chosen according to the Guideline on 
the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01 – January 2010). As thalidomide 
has teratogenic potential, only male subjects have been included in the bioequivalence study, which is 
agreed.  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 23/53 
 
  
 
 
 
All the subjects enrolled in the study fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the subjects were 
of normal health based on the general physical examination and laboratory tests. None of the subjects 
had any relevant or significant previous medical history that could affect the study results. 
The number of the subjects included was based on an adequate sample size calculation and is found 
sufficient. 
From 34 subjects randomised, 34 subjects completed the study. 33 have been included in the PK and 
statistical analyses. The individual values for the PK parameters determined for subject 016 have been 
reported but not included in the statistical analysis in line with the pre-specified criteria in the protocol.  
Two major protocol deviations on clinical part were reported, i.e. work up of plasma and interruption of 
upright position, both for the same subject 016; these deviations have been considered by the 
applicant to have the potential to affect the PK parameters. The subjects with major protocol 
deviations are excluded from the per-protocol analysis and that was pre-specified in the protocol. Thus, 
concentration data and pharmacokinetic parameters from dropped out or excluded subjects will be 
presented in the individual listings, if available, but will not be included in the summary statistics. 
According to the protocol, the bioequivalence assessment has been based on the results calculated 
without the data of the excluded subjects. 
As long as the strict restrictions on public life due to COVID-19 pandemic were in place, the trial was 
conducted in 2 groups in order to reduce the physical contact of individual persons to an absolutely 
necessary minimum allowing single room accommodation of the subjects.  
According to the protocol no subgroup analysis is planned. The study protocol has not been amended 
to specify that the subjects to be enrolled and dosed have to be divided into two dosing groups. The 
clinical study takes place at one site. The interval between groups is 3 days. 
•  Analytical methods   
Short description of the analytical method 
The plasma samples of subjects have been analysed using a validated analytical method. 
Blood samples were collected in into K2EDTA tubes and centrifuged within 30 min (centrifugation 
conditions: 2000 x g, 10 min, 4⁰C) to separate plasma. The stability of Thalidomide in whole blood for 
30 minutes after the blood samples have been drawn and before their centrifugation has been 
established in an ice bath, as requested at Day 120. Issue is resolved.  
The plasma samples were frozen and retained at ≤ -20⁰C until analysed. The bioanalyses were carried 
out between 26.08.2020 and 18.09.2020. 
•  Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Computation of the following pharmacokinetic variables has been performed: Cmax, AUC0-tlast, 
AUC0-∞, AUCextrapol%, Tmax, Tlast, Tlag, T1/2, and Lz (=λ) for Thalidomide Lipomed (Test product) 
and Thalidomide Celgene (Reference Product). 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters are: AUC0-tlast and Cmax. 
The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters are: AUC0-∞, AUCextrapol%, Tmax, Tlast, Tlag, T1/2 and 
λ. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated from individual plasma concentrations of 33 subjects 
out of 34 enrolled who completed both periods of the clinical trial successfully. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 24/53 
 
  
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetic parameters are adequate for a bioequivalence trial with immediate-release 
formulations. 
Subject 016 was excluded from the statistical analysis due to major protocol deviations, one 
considered to potentially affect Cmax and another to potentially interfere with the absorption process. 
In the responses provided at Day 121, the applicant submitted a full statistical and pharmacokinetic 
analysis with all 36 subjects included. The issue was solved. 
•  Statistical methods   
Statistical analysis was performed on ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic means, SD, geometric means, geometric CV, medians, minimum, 
and maximum) were presented for all pharmacokinetic parameters, separately for each treatment. 
In cases of missing value for a pharmacokinetic metric, this value has been reported as missing. For 
pairwise comparisons also the value to be compared has been considered missing, i.e. has been 
excluded from the comparison. However, this value remain in descriptive statistics, if the subject was 
considered eligible. 
Analysis included the factors formulation, period, sequence and subject(sequence) as fixed effects. 
Intra-subject variability was estimated and period, subject and sequence effects were determined. 
Affiliated statistical analyses were performed with an error probability of 0.05 (type-I error probability). 
Parametric point and interval estimates of Test/Reference ratio were calculated for AUC- and Cmax–
values. 
Relative bioavailability of Test vs. Reference was assessed by the ratios of geometric last square 
means (point estimates). This was computed and reported for Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters AUC0-tlast and Cmax. 
90% confidence intervals served as interval estimates and were determined by parametric analysis 
(two one-sided t-tests).  
As the subjects were enrolled and dosed divided in two groups 3 days apart, the group effect should be 
included in the ANOVA model and a new statistical analysis should be performed or otherwise it should 
be further justified. As requested, at Day 121, an additional statistical evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetic values of study 1386tha20ct was performed. Treatment comparison was performed 
by new ANOVA model considering group as an additional effect in analogy to the procedure of the 
initial evaluation described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Analysis included the factors formulation, group, period(group), sequence, sequence*group and 
subject (sequence*group) as fixed effects. 
The inclusion of the factor Group in the ANOVA model was based on the analogue evaluation of the 
factor Stage in the ANOVA model as recommended by EMA for the two-stage bioequivalence study 
design ( ANOVA factors according to the point 3.2 from EMA “Clinical pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics: questions and answers” ) 
In order to evaluate correctly the significance of the effects, the applicant conducted an ANOVA with 
the factor subject(sequence*group) as random effect in addition to the ANOVA with the factor 
subject(sequence*group) set as fixed effect. 
The inference from the treatment comparison was found identical in both approaches. 
The group effect was not found statistically significant for any PK parameters by using ANOVA model 
with the factor subject(sequence*group) as random effect. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 25/53 
 
  
 
 
Intra-subject variability was estimated and the aforementioned effects were determined.  
Affiliated statistical analyses were performed with an error probability of 0.05 (type-I error probability). 
Parametric point and interval estimates of Test/Reference ratio were calculated for AUC0-inf-, AUC0-
tlast- and Cmax–values. 
Relative bioavailability of Test vs. Reference was assessed by the ratios of geometric means (point 
estimates). 90% confidence intervals served as interval estimates and were determined by parametric 
analysis (two one-sided t-tests). 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence 
The acceptance criteria for bioequivalence were that the entire confidence intervals for the difference 
of means of Ln-transformed AUC0-tlast and Cmax should be within 80.00% -125.00%.

The statistical evaluation (CI and PE) including subject 016 was provided as requested: 
Table 6. Parametric point estimates and 90 % confidence intervals determined for 
pharmacokinetic parameters of thalidomide; comparison of Test vs. Reference 
Inclusion of subject 016 did not affect the statistical comparison of AUC0-tlast or AUC0-inf as point 
estimate and confidence interval for both parameters remained nearly identical compared to the 
previous evaluation without subject 016. 
For Cmax the point estimate also remained nearly identical, the confidence interval did slightly change 
with a minor trend to higher values (116.31 - 132.39 % without subject 016 to 117.20 – 133.10 % 
with subject 016). 
In response to Day 120 request the confidence intervals for the PK primary parameters were also 
calculated using ANOVA model with the “group” as an additional effect.

The results indicated no significant effect for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters in 
comparison with the initial results, therefore the applicant considered pooling the data of both groups 
justified.   
The Group-by-Formulation interaction was not included in the new ANOVA model and this effect should 
be tested. The applicant is asked to provide the statistical analysis with an updated ANOVA model 
including the Group-by-Formulation interaction effect in the statistical model.  
As requested, the exploratory analysis conducted separately by each group using the ANOVA model 
updated with the group by treatment interaction has been provided. Consistently with results obtained 
with the initial ANOVA analysis, the equivalence of Test and Reference was demonstrated in respect to 
the primary pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-tlast but not for Cmax. The applicant provided a 
clarification regarding the number of observations mentioned in the table results for each group. Issue 
solved.  
•  Safety data 
Safety parameters have been assessed in all 34 randomised subjects (FAS) throughout the study till 
completion. None of the subjects dropped out due to AEs. 
During the study, 23 AEs (56.10%) have been reported in 19 subjects (55.88%) after Test product 
administration and 18 AEs (43.90%) in 12 subjects (35.29%) after Reference product administration. 
32 out of 41 AEs (78.05 %) reported were assessed as study drug related and 9 out of 41 (21.95 %) 
as with no causal relationship. Eighteen (18) out of 32 (56.25 %) of the study drug related AEs were 
reported after Test treatment and 14 out of 32 (43.75 %) after Reference. 
The intensity of all AEs was mild in 29 out of 41 cases (70.73%) and moderate in 12 out of 41 cases 
(29.27%) and in no case severe. 
In case of study drug related AEs, the intensity was mild in 20 out of 41 cases (48.78 %) and 
moderate in 12 out of 41 cases (29.27%). 
Of the mild and drug related AEs, 11 could be associated to the Test and 9 to the Reference product. 
Drug related AEs of moderate intensity could be assigned to Test in 7 cases and to Reference in 5 
cases. 
There were no subjects who reported long-term medication during the study. 
There were no serious AEs and no deaths reported in the BE study. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 29/53 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the AEs reported in the BE study are in line with the known safety profile of thalidomide. There 
were no apparent differences in safety profiles, except fatigue, which was reported slightly more in 
subjects after Test product administration than after Reference product administration. 
No clinically relevant changes in the ECG parameters, vital signs and physical parameters related to 
safety were observed during the study. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion   
The 90% confidence interval for the ln-transformed values for AUC0-tlast was within the 
80.00-125.00% limit and is considered acceptable. In respect to the primary endpoint, AUC0-tlast, the 
bioequivalence was demonstrated. However, it should be noted that the confidence interval does not 
contain unity. 
The 90% confidence interval for the ln-transformed values for Cmax was not contained within the 
80.00- 125.00% limit, as the upper limit of the confidence interval was above 125%. Thus, in respect 
to the primary endpoint Cmax bioequivalence was not demonstrated. 
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.3.  Clinical safety 
2.4.3.1.  Post marketing experience 
According to the applicant, Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg, under the name Myrin 100 mg, is not a new 
formulation and it is authorised in three third countries: Ukraine, Morocco and Macedonia. In addition, 
in Ukraine and Morocco another strength, 50 mg, is authorised. The international birth date (IBD) for 
Myrin of Lipomed AG is the 18.05.2006. The authorised indication of Myrin 50 and Myrin 100 is 
multiple myeloma after failure of standard therapies.  
Moreover, the product Myrin has been also distributed under national specific programs in several 
countries worldwide since IBD: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Egypt, Great Britain, Hungary, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, 
Montenegro, Mexico, Montenegro, Oman, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, South Africa, State of Palestine, Syria, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Yemen, Vietnam, The 
Bahamas, Curacao, Barbados, Saint Kitts, Jamaica. 
Prior to marketing authorisation in the respective country, Myrin has also been distributed under the 
terms of national specific programs in Macedonia and Morocco. 
Since market introduction of Myrin 50 and Myrin 100, 155 spontaneous serious ADRs, 765 spontaneous 
non-serious ADRs and 3 serious ADRs from non-interventional post-marketing studies or from reports 
from other solicited sources, respectively, were received by the MAH.  
No data concerning ADRs by strength was provided by the MAH. The MAH was requested to provide a 
separate line-listing of cases serious/non-serious ADRs for from post-marketing sources received 
cumulatively for each strength of the product (presented by SOC/PT). The issue was solved  
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 30/53 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Cumulatively, the most reported PTs are the following: neuropathy peripheral (131 ADRs), anaemia 
(102 ADRs), thrombocytopenia (98 ADRs), neutropenia (95 ADRs), infection (73 ADRs), fatigue (77 
ADRs), vomiting (48 ADRs), constipation (50 ADRs), pain (29 ADRs), rash (21 ADRs), peripheral 
swelling (13 ADRs), diarrhoea (25 ADRs). 
The pattern of distribution of the most frequently reported ADRs remains in general consistent with the 
known safety profile of thalidomide.   
Having considered the data exposed in the last PSUR, we agree that the medicinal product has an 
acceptable safety profile. No new safety concerns have been identified. In addition, as requested at 
Day 120, the risk of medication errors was added in the Summary of safety concerns. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support this art. 10(3) application, change in the strength as compared to the Reference product, 
the company submitted one bioequivalence study and literature data on clinical pharmacology, efficacy 
and safety. The demonstration of bioequivalence by conducting a relative bioavailability study 
comparing one coated tablet of Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg to two hard capsules of Thalidomide 
Celgene 50 mg (reference medicinal product) was recommended by the CHMP, in order to support this 
article 10(3,) so-called ‘hybrid’, application of Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablet. The 
applicant has not submitted any other clinical studies to support this application. As the new strength 
is covered by the posology of the Reference product, this can be considered acceptable, provided that 
the bioequivalence criteria are fulfilled.  
The bioequivalence study with protocol 1386tha20ct was a single centre, open-label, randomised, 
balanced, 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover, single dose trial in healthy adult volunteers under fasting 
conditions between 100 mg coated tablet of Thalidomide Lipomed (by Lipomed GmbH) in comparison 
to two 50 mg hard capsules of Thalidomide Celgene (by Celgene Europe B.V.). The Marketing 
authorisation of Thalidomide Celgene has been transferred to another MAH, and it is currently known 
as Thalidomide BMS. 
The applicant has stated that the study has been conducted in compliance with GCP and GLP 
requirements. The bioequivalence study has been conducted at a CRO, which according to the 
applicant was subject to a GCP inspection in 2019 by the Authority of the state Thuringia, Germany. In 
addition, the applicant mentioned that a GCP inspection of the sponsor in Germany, has been 
conducted by the Authority of the state Hesse, Germany in 2018. At Day 121, the applicant submitted 
statements concerning the outcome of GCP inspections performed by EU authorities at the CRO, clinical 
and analytical sites. These statements are signed by the CRO and according to them no critical findings 
have been found by the EU authorities which inspected the clinical trial facilities. No inspection reports 
have been provided and no inspection for study 1386tha20ct was performed. As no potential major or 
critical findings relevant for the actual study were identified the issue is considered solved.  
The applicant was requested to provide quality assurance documents and monitoring reports of study 
1386tha20ct performed, according to the Guidance on the management of clinical trials during COVID-
19 pandemic, as these have not been found in the dossier. The applicant clarified that no specific audit 
have been performed during the study, therefore no quality assurance documents are available. 
However, the applicant mentioned that study-specific auditing of trial activities has been performed for 
other studies running in parallel and additional system audits have been performed, and as a 
consequence, each study benefits from quality improvement of processes even if no study-specific 
audit activity is performed as this was the case for Study 1386tha20ct. In the EMA/HMA Guidance on 
the management of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is mentioned that “in the current 
situation, on-site audits should, in general, be avoided or postponed” and “can be considered, after the 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 31/53 
 
  
 
 
agreement with the investigator and if audits are assessed as essential, e.g. triggered audits with the 
purpose of investigating serious deviations from the trial protocol or from applicable legislation”. 
During the assessment no GCP issues arose, therefore, the issue was not pursued further. The 
monitoring reports have been submitted as requested.  
According to the applicant, BfArM and an Independent Ethics Committee reviewed the protocol and the 
amendments to the protocol and the Informed Consent Form (ICF) was reviewed by the Independent 
Ethics Committee; the study was initiated after the approval from the IEC and BfArM. As requested, 
the approvals from the IEC and BfArM have been provided. 
According to the SmPC, the reference product should be taken as a single dose at bedtime with or 
without food, thus the bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions is acceptable.  
The selection of the highest dose, 100 mg, to be used in the bioequivalence study under fasting 
conditions is justified and in accordance with the guidelines.  
Overall, the study design is acceptable and in line with the pharmacokinetic properties of Thalidomide.  
The sampling period was sufficient, the sampling schedule and wash-out period were adequate taking 
into account the tmax and apparent terminal t1/2. Since AUC0-t covers at least 80% of AUC0-∞, the 
sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration time curve long enough.  
The population was chosen according to the guidelines. 34 subjects were randomised and completed 
the study. 33 were included in the PK and statistical analyses. 
Bioanalytical method had satisfactory performance and was adequately validated. The pharmacokinetic 
and statistical methods applied were appropriate for a single-dose study.  
Cmax was not observed in any subject at the first time point and pre-dose concentration has not been 
detected in any subject. The extrapolated AUC was not higher than 20% in any subject, thus the 
blood-sampling schedule up to 48h was defined adequately.  
Maximum exposure was higher for the Test product (arithmetic mean 1270 ng/mL) compared to the 
Reference product (arithmetic mean 1030 ng/mL). The median value of time to reach maximum 
exposure was slightly lower for Test product (2.00 h) as compared to Reference product (2.66 h). This 
indicate that the rate of thalidomide absorption from Test is higher as compared to Reference. 
For AUC0-tlast and Cmax parameters a statistically significant sequence or period effect was not shown, as 
the p values were above 0.05. For both AUC0-tlast and Cmax parameters a statistically significant 
treatment effect was shown. The detected statistically significant treatment effects are expected as the 
lower bound of the 90% CI is above 100% for both AUC0-tlast and Cmax parameters, indicating that there 
is a treatment effect, and the two products are not identical in terms of AUC or Cmax. They may still be 
considered bioequivalent, provided that the CI is contained within the usual boundaries. 
However, the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the ln-transformed values test and reference 
products are within the acceptance range of 80.00 - 125.00% only for AUC0-tlast. 
At Day 120, a major objection on the lack of the demonstration of the BE was identified. The 90% CI 
for the Cmax partially overlaps the acceptance range having the upper limit 132.39% and therefore 
exceeds the required limit of 125.00.  
An issue was identified regarding the exclusion of one subject (016) from the statistical and 
pharmacokinetic analysis. As requested, the applicant submitted a full statistical and pharmacokinetic 
analysis with all 36 subjects included. After inclusion of Subject 016, the point estimates and the 
confidence intervals for AUC0-last and AUC0-inf were nearly identical compared to those obtained after 
statistical and pharmacokinetic analysis of 35 subjects. The point estimate for Cmax also remained 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 32/53 
 
  
 
 
nearly identical. The confidence interval was slightly changed, i.e. 116.31 - 132.39 % without subject 
No. 016 and 117.20 – 133.10 % with subject 016. 
As the subjects were enrolled and dosed divided in two groups 3 days apart, as requested, an 
additional statistical evaluation of the pharmacokinetic values of study 1386tha20ct was performed.  
Treatment comparison was performed by new ANOVA model considering group as an additional effect 
in analogy to the procedure of the initial evaluation described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Analysis included the factors formulation, group, period(group), sequence, sequence*group and 
subject (sequence*group) as fixed effects. 
The inclusion of the factor Group in the ANOVA model was based on the analogue evaluation of the 
factor Stage in the ANOVA model as recommended by EMA for the two-stage bioequivalence study 
design (ANOVA factors according to the point 3.2 from EMA “Clinical pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics: questions and answers”) 
In order to evaluate correctly the significance of the effects, the applicant conducted an ANOVA with 
the factor subject(sequence*group) as random effect in addition to the ANOVA with the factor 
subject(sequence*group) set as fixed effect. 
The inference from the treatment comparison was found identical in both approaches. 
The group effect was not found statistically significant for any PK parameters by using ANOVA model 
ANOVA with the factor subject(sequence*group) as random effect. 
In response to the request, the confidence intervals for the PK primary parameters were also 
calculated using ANOVA model with the “group” as an additional effect. The results indicated no 
significant effect for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters in comparison with the initial 
results, therefore the applicant considered justified pooling the data of both groups. 
The exploratory analysis conducted separately by each group using the ANOVA model updated with the 
group by treatment interaction has been provided as requested. Consistently with results obtained with 
the initial ANOVA analysis, the equivalence of Test and Reference was demonstrated in respect to the 
primary pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-tlast but not for Cmax.  
The observed variability for Cmax was 15.60%, much lower that the assumed value of 25% taken into 
account in the sample size calculation; in addition, the drop-out rate was lower than anticipated. The 
minimum number of subjects required to establish the bioequivalence was estimated at 28 subjects.  
Despite the fact that the Cmax values of the applied hybrid medicinal product is approximately 24% 
higher than that of the reference product, a similar exposure was achieved as the AUC test/reference 
ratio was contained in the BE range. In the conducted relative bioavailability study, Cmax of the Test 
product was achieved faster than the Cmax of the Reference product, i.e. 2.00 (0.50 – 3.66) hours as 
comparedwith 2.66 (0.75 – 8.00) hours. From the data published, it appears that absorption of 
thalidomide is dependent on its solubility in gastric fluid, which is dependent on its dissolution rate in 
the gastrointestinal tract. Once the gastric fluid at the absorption site has been saturated with drug, 
further dissolution may not take place until some of the drug is absorbed across the intestinal lumen. 
The low solubility of thalidomide in the gastrointestinal tract results in a “flip-flop” phenomenon. That 
means, that the rate of absorption is significantly slower than the rate of elimination from the body.   
Cmax could give rise to adverse events. The incidence and severity of adverse events are related to 
dose and duration of therapy.  
The EPAR of Thalidomide Celgene (currently known as Thalidomide BMS) mentions that thalidomide 
has a narrow safety margin (100 – 400 mg) and the tolerability was better at the 200 mg/day dose as 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 33/53 
 
  
 
 
compared to 400 mg/day. The risk of toxic ADRs increases in a dose-dependent manner. As such, the 
recommended dose in the reference product SmPC is 200 mg thalidomide orally per day administered 
for a limited period of time, i.e. maximum number of 12 cycles of 6 weeks (42 days). In section 4.2 
Posolgy and method of administration, it is written that “patients should be monitored for: 
thromboembolic events, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions, bradycardia, syncope, 
somnolence, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent 
upon the NCI CTC (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) grade, may be necessary”. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction that may result in 
irreversible damage. It general occurs after chronic use; however, reports following relatively short-
term use also exist. Incidence of neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or 
interruption increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy. Grade 1-2 NCI CTC peripheral 
neuropathy can occur in more than 80% of patients, whereas severe grade 3-4 neuropathy occurs in 
approx. 3-5% of patients.  
Because the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy is not predictable and a preventive treatment does 
not exist, minimisation measures are important, such as those mentioned in the SmPC, i.e. dose delay, 
reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC grade. 
To demonstrate that the differences in Cmax between the Test (one Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg 
coated tablet) and Reference (two Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules) formulations of 
thalidomide at the recommended therapeutic dose of 200 mg are clinically not relevant, the Cmax 
value observed for Test in the relative bioavailability study 1386tha20ct was dose-adjusted 
(extrapolated considering 15% deviation from proportionality) and compared with published 
thalidomide Cmax values following administration of thalidomide 200 mg.  
Assuming a linear pharmacokinetics for thalidomide from Thalidomide Lipomed, mean Cmax values 
around 2500 ng/mL would theoretically be expected at the highest recommended dose (200 mg/day).  
However, in line with the available published data related to the Thalidomide dose proportionality, a 
significant deviation from proportionality has been noticed for Cmax with increases being less than 
proportional than dose increase and almost dose proportionality for AUC0-∞. Therefore, at higher 
doses, the drug may be absorbed at a slower rate.  
As in study 1386tha20ct, a comparison of one 100 mg coated tablet of Test (Thalidomide Lipomed 100 
mg) to two 50 mg hard capsules of Reference (Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg) after single-dose 
administration under fasted conditions was performed, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the 
approved daily dose of 200 mg have not been determined. Therefore, the applicant estimated the 
concentration profiles for the test and reference products at steady state after multiple doses of 100 
mg and 200 mg and after single dose of 200 mg based on the pop PK model. 
As mentioned above, specifically for thalidomide from Thalidomide Celgene, there was a significant 
deviation from dose proportionality when single oral doses were increased from 50 mg to 200 mg, with 
the increase in Cmax being approximately 30% less than expected in a linear system (Teo et al. 
2001a). 
For a conservative approach it was assumed that the deviation from proportionality in Cmax for 
Thalidomide Lipomed is only half that of Thalidomide Celgene (i.e. 15%) when increasing the dose 
from 100 mg to 200 mg. 
Therefore Cmax,ss for Thalidomide Lipomed was estimated based on population-pharmacokinetic 
modelling, assuming 15% deviation from proportionality as justified above. 
Based on the pop PK model when increasing the dose from 100 mg to 200 mg Cmax for the test 
product Thalidomide Lipomed was estimated to 2159 ng/mL(after a single dose) and to 2161 ng/mL. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 34/53 
 
  
 
 
(at steady state). This is consistent with the published data available indicating that mean Cmax,ss is 
almost identical with mean Cmax on day 1 and no accumulation or time dependency of the thalidomide 
pharmacokinetics has been noticed (Teo et al. 2004). 
Published data regarding the lack of accumulation after repeated doses have been submitted indicating 
that single dose Cmax data are predictive for steady-state conditions (i.e. Cmax,ss). 
A supportive analysis has been also conducted to support the lack of accumulation after the 
administration of the test product Thalidomide Lipomed based on observed PK data from the BE study 
after a single dose of 100 mg (including subject 016). The ratio of the partial area over the dosing 
interval (AUC0-24,SD) to the AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞,SD) observed for both test and 
reference products is 94 to 95% indicating that a low extent of accumulation can be expected for the 
test product. 
In addition, it is confirmed that single dose Cmax data are predictive for steady-state conditions (i.e. 
Cmax,ss) also for test product. 
In order to conduct the requested exposure safety analysis at the recommended therapeutic dose of 
200 mg a comparison of the estimated values for Cmax of the test product Thalidomide Lipomed with 
published available literature data has been conducted indicating that estimated Cmax associated with 
the use of Thalidomide Lipomed at the recommended therapeutic dose of 200 mg is within the range of 
Cmax and Cmax,ss values assessed in publicly available studies investigating single and multiple oral 
doses of thalidomide 200 mg confirmed to be efficacious and safe. 
A summary of high thalidomide dosages in other indications associated with high peak plasma 
concentrations has been presented, indicating that there were no safety issues which would suggest 
the presence of Cmax threshold toxicities. The published data include peak concentrations up to 11070 
ng/ml which is several times higher than expected for Thalidomide Lipomed at the recommended 
therapeutic dose (200 mg) Therefore, there is no apparent increased risk of adverse drug reactions 
upon use of 200 mg Thalidomide Lipomed at steady state (Cmax,ss -2161 ng/mL) comparative with 
Thalidomide Celgene (1500 ng/ml). 
Based on the pop PK model, the estimated Cmax,ss for the reference medicinal product after 
administration of multiple doses of 200 mg dose is around 1500 ng/ml, which is within the range 
reported in the published data regarding the Cmax,ss of the reference product Thalidomide Celgene 
also in healthy subjects, for which a mean Cmax,ss (2300 ± 330 ng/mL) is mentioned in the study 
conducted by Scheffler et. al 1999 and a mean Cmax,ss value of 1.2 mg/L (1200 ng/mL) reported in 
the study published by Teo et al. 2004. 
After a single oral dose of thalidomide 100 mg administered orall,y it has been noted that C24 values 
after single oral dosing are similar with Ctau (=Cmin,ss) values predicted from modelling both for test 
and reference products. It is noted that in the absence of any relevant accumulation, as justified for 
the PK of thalidomide above, the C24 value after a single oral dose is very similar to Ctau (=Cmin,ss), 
C24 covering more than 90% of the Cmin,ss. 
After single or multiple oral doses of thalidomide 200 mg, C24 and Ctau (=Cmin,ss) values for test 
product Thalidomide Lipomed were estimated based on pop PK model, thereby yielding C24 and Ctau 
(=Cmin,ss) values of 171 and 178 ng/mL, respectively. The estimates values for C24 and Ctau 
(=Cmin,ss) for the reference product Thalidomide Celgene 200 mg are also included. 
The simulated values have been compared with the values form the publicly available studies 
investigating single and multiple oral doses of thalidomide 100 mg and 200 mg. The C24 and Ctau 
(=Cmin,ss) values associated with the use of Thalidomide Lipomed are within the range of C24 and

Ctau (=Cmin,ss) estimates reported in the public domain confirm to be efficacious and safe. This 
applies to a dose of 100 mg as well as to the recommended therapeutic dose of 200 mg. 
In addition the estimated values for C24 and Ctau (=Cmin,ss) values associated with the use of the 
test product Thalidomide Lipomed at 200 mg are well above the values obtained after 100 mg dose for 
the reference medicinal product, therefore the efficacy is not compromised (171 and 178 ng/mL, 
respectively comparative with 70.38 and 70.10 ng/mL, respectively, considering that a dose of 100 mg 
per day is confirmed to be efficacious and safe for Thalidomide Celgene). 
During the treatment with thalidomide no therapeutic drug monitoring is required to achieve a certain 
Cmin plasma concentration to assure efficacy. 
Supporting publication has been also submitted concluding that there was no relationship between the 
concentration of thalidomide in the plasma and the efficacy (P >0.8). 
Additional data has been also provided supporting that AUC parameter is more related with the efficacy 
and low trough (Cmin,ss) levels should be maintained to limit drug-related toxicities. 
Considering Cmin,ss values for the test product Thalidomide Lipomed are lower that the values 
obtained for the reference product it could be concluded that fewer drug-related toxicities could be 
expected after administration of the test product, while the efficacy is similar based on AUC 
equivalence demonstrated in the conducted BE study. 
The results of the comparative in vitro dissolution testing of the batches used in the conducted relative 
bioavailability study have been provided for three different buffers over the complete physiological pH 
range (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) with and without surfactant. As requested, the individual data on 12 units 
and variability have been submitted. Although the in vitro similarity has not been demonstrated, the in 
vivo results prevails and in vitro data is only complementary to the bioequivalence study. 
One issue was identified regarding the reduction of the dose in case of peripheral neuropathy. As the 
medicinal product will be available only in one strength, i.e. 100 mg, and it is formulated as coated 
tablet, in case of neuropathy the reduced dose cannot be achieved. This issue was solved as at Day 
121; the SmPC was revised specifying that “for dose reductions below 100 mg, thalidomide-containing 
medicinal products with other strengths should be used”.  
Overall, the AEs reported in the BE study are in line with the known safety profile of thalidomide. There 
were no apparent differences in safety profiles, except fatigue, which was reported slightly more in 
subjects after Test product administration than after Reference product administration. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The BE study is pivotal for this application.  
With respect to the primary endpoint Cmax, bioequivalence was not demonstrated. However, the 
differences in Cmax between the Test (one Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablet) and Reference 
(two Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules) formulations of thalidomide at the recommended 
therapeutic dose of 200 mg after a single dose and at steady state are not considered a safety 
problem. 
Potential uncertainties related to Cmin and Ctau for efficacy have been adequately addressed and 
efficacy is not compromised for the test product despite the lower values achieved for Cmin and Ctau 
after the test product comparative with values achieved after the administration of the reference 
medicinal product after the administration of 100 mg and 200 mg doses, respectively.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of thalidomide hard capsules. The reference product 
Thalidomide Celgene (currently known as Thalidomide BMS) is indicated for the following therapeutic 
indication: 
Thalidomide Celgene in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated as first line treatment 
of patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy. 
Thalidomide Celgene is prescribed and dispensed in accordance with the Thalidomide Celgene 
Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Non-clinical studies have not been provided for this application and this is considered adequate. From a 
clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single centre, open-label, randomised, 
balanced, 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover, single dose trial in healthy adult volunteers under fasting 
conditions. The study design is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation 
and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall 
sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablet does not meet the protocol-defined 
criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules. The 
point estimate and its 90% confidence interval for the parameter AUC0-tlast were all contained within 
the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. The point estimate for the parameter 
Cmax was contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%; however, its 
90% confidence interval for the parameter Cmax was not contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00% and its point estimate is 124.09%. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was not demonstrated.  
However, the differences in Cmax between the Test (one Thalidomide Lipomed 100 mg coated tablet) 
and Reference (two Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules) formulations of thalidomide at the 
recommended therapeutic dose of 200 mg after a single dose and at steady state are not considered a 
safety problem. 
Potential uncertainties related to Cmin and Ctau for efficacy have been adequately addressed and 
efficacy is not compromised for the test product despite the lower values achieved for Cmin, and Ctau 
after the test product comparative with values achieved after the administration of the reference 
medicinal product after the administration of 100 mg and 200 mg doses, respectively. A benefit/risk 
ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Thalidomide Lipomed is not similar to Kyprolis 
(carfilzomib), Imnovid (pomalidomide), Ninlaro (ixazomib), Farydak (panobinostat), Darzalex 
(daratumumab), Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin), Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) and Carvykti 
(ciltacabtagene autoleucel) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
EMA/773068/2022  
Page 42/53 
 
  
 
 
847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Thalidomide Lipomed is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Thalidomide Lipomed in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated as first line treatment 
of patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose 
chemotherapy.  
Thalidomide Lipomed is prescribed and dispensed in accordance with the Thalidomide Lipomed 
Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Thalidomide Lipomed Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) with controlled distribution 
system 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) will implement a Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) in 
each Member State where Thalidomide Lipomed is marketed. Details of the PPP will be agreed with the 
national competent authority (NCA) in each Member State and put in place prior to the launch of the 
medicinal product. The PPP will include implementation of a controlled distribution system in each 
concerned country, in agreement with the respective NCA, to ensure that all physicians and 
pharmacists who intend to prescribe or dispense Thalidomide Lipomed have access to the educational 
materials and are aware of the teratogenic properties and other important risks of thalidomide as well 
as the corresponding risk minimisation measures. 
EMA/773068/2022

Educational Materials 
The MAH will agree the contents of the Educational Healthcare Professional’s Kit with the NCA in each 
Member State prior to launch of the medicinal product. In agreement with the respective NCAs, the 
Educational Healthcare Professional’s Kit is proposed to contain the following educational materials and 
report forms: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Educational healthcare professional booklet with patient assessment algorithm and pregnancy 
testing and contraception requirements 
Treatment initiation forms and/or equivalent tool for women of childbearing potential, women of 
non-childbearing potential, and male patients 
Educational brochures for patients (female and male) 
Patient cards and/or equivalent tools 
Summary of product characteristics, package leaflet and labelling 
Pregnancy reporting materials and information 
Adverse reaction reporting forms. 
The proposed key elements of each of these materials are described below.  
Prior to approval by the NCA and launch of the medicinal product in countries where the reference 
product is not approved or marketed, the MAH will ensure that the educational materials for patients 
are provided to and reviewed by the national patients’ organisations or if such an organisation does not 
exist or cannot be involved, by a relevant patients’ group. Patients involved will be preferably naïve to 
the history of thalidomide. Results of the user testing will be provided to the NCA and final materials 
validated at a national level. 
The MAH will notify the EMA and the appropriate national patients and victims’ representatives of the 
proposed launch date before launch in each Member State.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  Dzuveo,  sufentanil  sublingual  tablet  30  μg,  has  been 
submitted for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adult patients.   
About the product 
Dzuveo  (sufentanil  30μg  sublingual  tablet,  (also  referred  to  as  “SST  30  μg”)  is  a  non-invasive  opioid 
analgesic  administered  by  healthcare  professional  (HCP)  via  the  sublingual  route.  Dzuveo  30  μg 
sublingual  tablet  is  packaged  in  a  single  use,  disposable,  single-dose  applicator  (SDA).  Because  each 
sublingual tablet is very small, the SDA helps the HCP administer the tablet to the patients’ sublingual 
space. Dosing is as required (prn), subject to a one hour minimum dosing interval.  
Sufentanil  is  a  synthetic,  potent  opioid  with  highly  selective  binding  to  μ-opioid  receptors.  Sufentanil 
binds to non-human primate μ-opioid receptors with14-times higher affinity than morphine. 
Analgesia induced by sufentanil is thought to be mediated via activation of μ-opioid receptors primarily 
within  the  CNS  to  alter  processes  affecting  both  the  perception  of  and  emotional  response  to  pain.

Alterations in the release of various neurotransmitters from afferent nerves sensitive to painful stimuli 
may be partially responsible for the analgesic effects. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Application for a marketing authorisation of Dzuveo is submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC (“hybrid” Application) using Sufenta solution for injection as reference medicinal product. 
Sufenta  has  been  authorised  in  the  Netherlands  since  1978  as  an  anaesthetic-analgesic.  Sufenta 
contains  the  same  active  substance  as  Dzuveo  but  it  is  administered  via  the  intravenous  or  epidural 
route.  
The  Application  was  supported  by  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data.  A  dedicated  clinical  program 
was conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics of sublingual sufentanil and establish efficacy and 
safety of this  new route of administration in the new indication.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as an immediate release sublingual tablet containing 30 µg sufentanil 
(as citrate salt) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), calcium hydrogen phosphate, hypromellose, croscarmellose 
sodium, indigo carmine (E132), stearic acid and magnesium stearate. 
The product is available in polypropylene (PP) single-dose applicators, which are packaged in polyester 
film/LDPE/aluminium foil/LDPE sachets with an oxygen absorber as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
The chemical name of sufentanil citrate is N-[4-(methoxymethyl)-1-[2-(2-thienyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]-
N-phenylpropanamide citrate or N-[4-(methoxymethyl)-1-[2-(thiophen-2-yl) ethyl] piperidin-4-yl]-N-
phenylpropanamide citrate corresponding to the molecular formula C 22H30N2O2S.C6H8O7. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 587.7 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 1): 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 9/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Sufentanil citrate structure 
The structure of sufentanil citrate was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, 
and mass spectrometry. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline non-hygroscopic solid, soluble in water and 
sparingly soluble in ethanol and acetone. Two polymorphic forms of the active substance are known. 
XRPD patterns of 3 production scale batches from the proposed manufacturer indicated that the same 
polymorphic form is routinely produced. However, since sufentanil citrate is dissolved in ethanol as 
part of the finished product manufacture, the polymorphic form is not considered important. Whilst 
particle size is also not deemed important, the sufentanil citrate is sieved to ensure a consistent 
dissolution profile for secondary manufacture. 
Sufentanil citrate is achiral. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Sufentanil citrate is synthesized by a single manufacturer in eight main steps using commercially 
available and well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin, fate and purge and were characterised. The purge of genotoxic reagents and 
by-products has been demonstrated in intermediates made on commercial scale. Adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The active substance is packaged in type II amber glass bottles with phenolic resin closure which 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications used by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for 
appearance, identity (IR, UV, HPLC), identity of counter ion (USP), assay (HPLC, titration), related 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 10/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
substances (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP) and appearance of solution (Ph. 
Eur.). The tests and limits are consistent with the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A have been qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The applicant has 
demonstrated the purge of mutagenic materials used in the process. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the 
reference standard of the active substance has been provided. 
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 15 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in either the proposed commercial container, or for earlier batches, a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market (a smaller scale version of the commercial pack) for up 
to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance, loss on drying, assay (by titration and HPLC), related substances and 
degradation products. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, and were stability 
indicating. One batch gave out of specification results (too high) for assay at the 3, 6 and 36 month 
time points. This was linked to an overcharge of sufentanil base during the salt formation and the 
process was modified accordingly for the manufacture of subsequent batches. Health hazard evaluation 
and toxicology assessment determined the small amount of Sufentanil free base present in those 
batches of sufentanil citrate posed little or no health concern to patients. There were no other 
significant trends in any batches under any storage condition. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out under conditions of heat (up to 150 oC), acid or base 
hydrolysis, and oxidation in solution. Degradation was observed on refluxing in acid or base, and in the 
presence of hydrogen peroxide. Exposure to oxygen is thus kept to a minimum. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed 
container, tightly closed and stored in a well-ventilated area. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  a  blue-coloured  flat-faced  immediate  release  sublingual  tablet  with  rounded 
edges containing sufentanil citrate equivalent to 30 µg sufentanil. It is 3 mm in diameter and 0.85 mm 
thick with a nominal tablet weight of 7.40 mg. 
The  finished  drug  product  is  defined  as  a  single  sufentanil  sublingual  30  µg  tablet  packaged  in  a 
polypropylene  single  dose  applicator  (SDA)  in  a  PE/Al  laminate  foil  pouch  together  with  a  StabilOx 
oxygen absorber. A diagram of the applicator, containing the tablet, is shown in Figure 2: 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 11/85 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: the single dose applicator for Dzuveo 
The developed 30 µg formulation is essentially similar to a previously-developed 15 µg tablet used in 
another  development  program,  with  the  exception  of  a  doubling  of  active  substance  content  and  a 
change  of  colorant.  The  tablet  size,  shape,  weight  and  manufacturing  process  are  identical. 
Development work was conducted on the initial 15 µg sublingual tablet and then transferred to the 30 
µg formulation. Several verification studies were conducted throughout the development of the 30 µg 
tablet to assure that these small changes did not affect the overall product performance.  
Sufentanil is highly potent and thus constitutes only a minor proportion of the finished tablet 
composition (0.4%). In order to ensure content uniformity, it is dissolved in ethanol before spraying 
onto the excipients before granulation. 
At the start of the project, a quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined. Sufentanil has high 
first-pass metabolism which rules out the oral route. The citrate salt is readily soluble in aqueous 
media, is rapidly absorbed via the oral mucosa, and the sublingual route is non-invasive. The aim was 
to develop a very small tablet with minimal taste to minimise saliva response and the possibility of 
swallowing the drug, and to minimise patient discomfort. The tablet needs to remain in the sublingual 
space for long enough to ensure complete drug release which should be fast enough to ensure the 
required response and ensure plasma levels reach targets within the therapeutic window. The tablets 
need to be robust enough to remain intact during usage and sufficiently stable to allow a reasonable 
shelf-life. Given the low dose, content uniformity is vital. 
Excipients were chosen based on compatibility with the active substance and in order to adapt tablet 
properties to the above-mentioned requirements. Given the sublingual delivery method, mannitol was 
chosen as the major formulation component due to its sweet taste and aqueous solubility. 
Hypromellose is added in order to improve adhesion of tablets to the sublingual cavity. Croscarmellose 
was included as a disintegrant and the amount added was optimised in order to afford rapid tablet 
disintegration without compromising the bioadhesion characteristics. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were defined (assay, active substance and finished product purity and 
stability, content uniformity, active substance dissolution and device compatibility) and are appropriate 
for the chosen dosage form. Potential critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified for each 
process step by means of formalised risk assessment. Potential CPPs identified to have a medium or 
Assessment report

Page 12/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high impact risk on finished product CQAs were investigated in more detail, applying statistical Design 
of Experiments, as well as univariate experiments. The relationship between CQAs and CPPs has been 
discussed in detail. Based on the results of the performed experiments, operating parameters and in-
process controls (IPC) were established to assure manufacturing of a robust product in reproducible 
quality. The dissolution method was shown to be discriminatory against different levels of 
hypromellose which is the excipient with the largest impact on dissolution rate. Changes to other 
manufacturing parameters in the ranges studied did not impact the dissolution profile of the finished 
product. 
An overage of sufentanil citrate is applied to compensate for an equivalent loss in assay during the 
manufacturing process, specifically, the granulation step. The loss of active substance has been 
investigated and only part of the lost material can be accounted for. This is considered acceptable as 
the assay method has been shown to pick up changes in active substance content. 
Content uniformity was originally investigated on the blend prior to tableting. However, the low active 
substance content and overall low batch size made this inaccurate. Therefore, the applicant applies 
stratified testing of content uniformity in tablets prior to release to ensure that the active substance is 
evenly distributed. 
The primary packaging is a PP single-dose applicator packaged inside a polyester film/LDPE/aluminium 
foil/LDPE sachet with an oxygen absorber. The packaging materials are inert and are commonly used 
for drug products and comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The 
device is fully integrated at the time of placing on the market (i.e. no assembly of the medicine part is 
needed before administration). Hence, no CE marking for the device is required. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  production  of  bulk  tablets  followed  by  insertion  into  the 
applicator.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process.  The  process  for 
manufacturing  the  bulk  tablets  consists  of  5  main  steps:  blending  of  intra-granular  excipients;  wet 
granulation using a solution of sufentanil dissolved in ethanol followed by drying; blending with extra-
granular excipients followed by milling; compression to form tablets; bulk packaging. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated on  three  consecutive  production  scale 
batches  of  finished  product.  Although  this  information  was  not  provided  with  the  initial  submission, 
resulting  in  a  major  objection,  the  applicant  was  able  to  provide  complete  validation  data  during  the 
procedure.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The  IPCs are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing  process  and  pharmaceutical  form.  In  particular,  tablets  are  checked  for  weight, 
thickness, resistance to crushing and friability following compression to ensure that the tablets are of 
consistent  size  and  are  sufficiently  robust.  In  addition,  visual  inspections  are  carried  out  during 
packaging  to  ensure  that  each  applicator  contains  a  single  tablet  and  that  it  has  been  correctly 
assembled. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, identification (HPLC, 2 separate methods), assay (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018

Eur.), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and microbiological purity 
(Ph. Eur.). A further test to check adequate dispensing of tablets from the applicator is carried out. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. A risk assessment for the presence of elemental 
impurities was carried out in accordance with ICH Q3D. The conclusion was that given the small size of 
tablets, the nature of raw materials, and the manufacturing equipment, the likelihood of elemental 
impurities being present above the PDE is extremely low. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  24  months  under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  were  manufactured  by  the 
proposed commercial manufacturer using active substance from the ASMF holder and packaged in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, dissolution, impurities, water content and microbiological 
quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  have  been  shown  to  be  stability  indicating.  No  significant 
changes to any of the measured parameters were observed.  
In  addition,  1  batch  was exposed to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline on  Photostability  Testing  of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  exposed  in  the  open,  or  in  the  applicator  showed  an 
increase  in  impurities  and  a  corresponding  drop  in  assay.  However,  tablets  stored  in  the  applicator 
inside the commercial foil pouch were found to be stable. The product should therefore be kept inside 
the  foil  pouch  in  which  it  is  supplied.  Samples  were  also  tested  following  exposure  to  different 
temperature conditions (-20, 5 or 50 oC) and were found to be stable. 
Stability  studies  were  also  carried  out  on  in-process  intermediates  in  order  to  assign  suitable  hold 
times.  Samples  of  both  granulated  blend  and  bulk  tablets  were  stored  in  their  respective  packages, 
inside  foil  pouches  containing  oxygen  absorbers.  The  samples  were  found  to  be  stable  and  thus,  the 
proposed  maximum  holding  times  of  6  months  for  the  granulated  blend  and  7  months  for  the  bulk 
tablets are deemed acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months in the store in the original 
package in order to protect from light and oxygen as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. A sublingual tablet was

developed in order to by-pass first pass metabolism. The chosen citrate salt is readily dissolved and 
rapidly absorbed via the oral mucosa, giving a rapid onset of action. The sublingual tablets are 
packaged in a single-dose applicator, which is an integral part of the product and does not need a CE 
mark. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC 
are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
The reference product Sufenta is approved for IV and epidural administration, therefore substantial 
elements of the nonclinical profile have already been established. The systemic pharmacological, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sufentanil have already been demonstrated.  To 
support the application for the oral sublingual route, targeted pharmacokinetic studies have been 
performed in dogs by comparative assessment of absorption after IV, oral, buccal and sublingual single 
dose administration. The toxicological program included GLP compliant repeat-dose toxicology and 
local tolerance studies in Golden Syrian hamster after buccal administration.  
These bridging data has been previously assessed by the CHMP in the evaluation of Marketing 
Authorisation Application for Zalviso (sublingual sufentanil 15 mg).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No separate studies have been performed by the Applicant.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A limited nonclinical pharmacokinetic program was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the 
sublingual route of administration. Absorption studies were conducted in Beagle dogs using two 
experimental formulations of sufentanil. The sublingual route of exposure was compared to the 
intravenous, oral and buccal routes of administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 15/85 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
In two absorption studies in dogs the sublingual formulation systemic bioavailability was between 
57%-and 60%.  The formulation containing protonated sufentanil molecules (citrate salt) showed 
faster absorption, but bioavailability was significantly lower, which might be due to different absorption 
pathways.   Another factor which is important regarding kinetics is the site where tablet was disposed 
to.  It did not influence the extent of absorption but after buccal administration the Cmax was less 
than half of the sublingual way.  As expected, sufentanil had poor oral bioavailability (less than 10%).  
Although the PK studies did not use the proposed clinical formulation, they provide supporting data to 
justify the use of sublingual sufentanil for the suggested therapeutic indication.   
Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion 
No separate studies were conducted but relevant data were summarised by the Applicant based on 
published literature.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No single dose toxicity studies, genetic toxicology studies, carcinogenicity studies or reproductive 
toxicity studies were conducted by the applicant.  Instead, references were made to published 
literature and data available for the reference product, Sufenta.  
A limited toxicology program was conducted to evaluate the local and systemic effects of sufentanil in 
sublingual tablet using buccal administration to hamsters. These bridging studies were designed to 
determine if the new route of exposure resulted in different adverse effects versus what is observed 
with the approved routes of administration.  
Repeat dose toxicity  
SST  was  evaluated  in  repeat  dose  studies  in  hamsters  for  7  days  (WIL-591012)  and  28  days  (WIL-
591014).  The  results  of  the  2  studies  were  very  similar.  Clinical  signs  typical  of  opioid  pharmacology 
(rigid  body,  hypoactivity,  respiratory  depression)  were  observed  at  all  doses.  The  severity  of  the 
effects increased with dose. Dose dependent decreases in body weight were observed in both studies. 
Increased  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  count,  haemoglobin  and  hematocrit  were  observed,  suggestive  of 
hemoconcentration  due  to  dehydration.  There  were  no  significant  local  effects  nor  were  there  any 
effects  on  clinical  chemistry,  organ  weight,  gross  necropsy  or  histopathology.  All  effects  were 
reversible  during  the  recovery  period.  It  was  concluded  that  the  pharmacological  and  toxicological 
effects of SST were typical of what would be expected from an opioid agonist. 
Based  on  study  WIL-591014,  hamsters  tolerated  SST  at  sufentanil  doses  up  to  180  μg/day  (No 
Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL))  via  buccal  administration.  The  adverse  effects  identified  in 
this  study  are  consistent  with  exaggerated  pharmacological  action  of  an  opioid  agonist.  At  the 
Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (180  μg/day),  no  additional  target  organs  were  identified.  This  dose  is 
equivalent to a sufentanil dose of about 13,000 μg/day in the clinic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 16/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Local tolerance 
To  evaluate  the  local  tolerance  of  SST,  hamsters  were  subcutaneously  administered  naltrexone,  an 
opioid antagonist, prior to SST administration. A dose range finding study (Study 692063) established 
that  a  10  mg/kg  naltrexone  dose  was  adequate  to  block  the  opioid  effects  of  400  μg/day  sufentanil 
(SST  80  μg,  5  times/day).  In  the  pivotal  study  (Study  692032),  hamsters  tolerated  400  μg/day 
sufentanil  (SST  80  μg,  5  times/day,  2  hours  apart)  for  4  days  with  minimal  effects  on  the  gross 
pathology and histopathology of the cheek pouch. It was concluded that SST has minimal potential for 
local irritation.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase  I  assessment  demonstrates  that  sufentanil  citrate  is  not likely  to  achieve  sufficient  penetration 
into  the  surface  water  (the  expected  primary  compartment)  to  trigger  a  Phase  II  assessment.  It  is 
therefore concluded that a Phase II environmental assessment of sufentanil citrate is not required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Sufentanil is a well-known synthetic mu opioid receptor agonist analgesic. Non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology including the primary effect on analgesia and all other opioid actions 
are well-known. Since the Application is based on Article 10(3) of Directive 83/2001/EC, the applicant 
submitted mainly bibliographic data.

The  Applicant  conducted  three  in-vivo  studies  in  male  beagle  dogs.  Absorption  into  the  systemic 
circulation and substantial systemic bioavailability of 58 and 75% after sublingual administration, due 
to avoidance of intestinal and first-pass liver metabolism, was showed. Oral bioavailability was shown 
to be poor indicating less concern in case of accidental swallowing of the drug. 
The applicant identified four impurities and it was concluded that none of them are genotoxic. 
The  applicant  also  summarized  published  literature  concerning  single  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, which in general is sufficient to conclude on 
safety of the product candidate. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Taken  together,  the  submitted  non-clinical  data  supports  the  clinical  use  of  Dzuveo  in  the  proposed 
dose and indication. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  clinical  development  program  for  SST  30  μg  included  1  Phase  2  study  (SAP202),  and  3  Phase  3 
studies  (SAP301,  SAP302,  and  SAP303).  Two  of  these  were  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled clinical trials (Study SAP301 and Study SAP202) conducted in 221 patients (SST 30 μg, N = 
147;  placebo,  N  =  74)  using  well-recognized  postoperative  pain  models  (elective  abdominal  surgery 
and elective bunionectomy). Efficacy of SST 30 μg was additionally supported by results from 2 Phase 
3, open-label studies (SAP302, and SAP303, N = 216).   
Studies previously submitted and evaluated for Zalviso MAA were also taken into account.

2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  applicant  has  submitted  1  BA  and  5  PK  studies  to  support  the  application  for  30  µg  sufentanil 
sublingual  tablet.  This  MAA  contained  1  new  additional  study,  SAP101  but  was  partly  relying  on  the 
clinical  studies  conducted  for  Zalviso  (SST  15  µg):  the  BA  study  IAP102,  the  two  PK  studies  IAP101 
and ARX-F01-01 and the PK drug interactions study (ketoconazole) IAP104.  
The results of the BA and PK studies submitted to support the marketing authorisation for SST 30 mcg 
showed  that  systemic  exposure  of  sufentanil  after  Sufenta  IV  30  mcg  was  greater  than  after  single-
dose SST 30 mcg. The mean bioavailability (F) approximately the same after administration of single-
dose  SST  30  mcg  and  2  doses  of  SST  15  mcg,  53%  and  59%,  respectively.  Median  CST1/2  was  2.33 
hours  after  administration  of  either  single-dose  SST  30  mcg  or  2  consecutive  doses  of  SST  15  mcg 
compared to 0.10 hours following Sufenta IV 30 mcg.  
The  PK  study  SAP101  evaluated  the  single-dose  and  multiple-dose  PK  of  sublingual  administration  of 
the  SST  30  mcg  formulation  and  compared  the  PK  of  the  single  dose  to  2  doses  of  Zalviso  (SST  15 
mcg)  administered  20  minutes  apart.  Additional  PK  modelling  demonstrated  that  bioequivalence  is 
maintained  if  the  inter-dosing  interval  for  the  15  mcg  SST  tablets  is  extended  to  25  minutes  which 
supports the applicability of safety data from clinical trials of ARX-01 (Zalviso 15 mcg) for use in this 
marketing  authorisation  application  for  the  ARX-04  (SST  30  mcg).  The  applicant  also  submitted  an

updated  population  PK  analysis  study  ACX-PPK-259-001,  which  included  concentration  data  from  the 
Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials with the new SST 30 μg tablets additionally to that already obtained following 
SST 15 μg (Zalviso).  
There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  any  PK  parameter  (AUC0-inf,  Cmax,  Tmax,  K el,  t1/2,  and 
CST1/2) after administration of single-dose SST 30 mcg when compared to that of 2 consecutive doses 
of SST 15 mcg (with 20 minutes between doses). For single-dose SST 30 mcg and 2 doses of SST 15 
mcg (with 20 minutes between doses) the primary pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-inf and Cmax both 
had 90% CIs of the GMR that fell within the 0.8 to 1.25 range, supporting bioequivalence. 
Sufentanil  concentrations  accumulated  upon  multiple  dosing  and  steady  stated  was  reached  after  7 
doses (or 360 minutes) of SST 30 mcg. After the last of 12 consecutive doses of SST 30 mcg, AUC0-60 
and Cmax increased by 3.7 fold and 2.3 fold, respectively, compared to after the first dose. Median Tmax 
was  8.92  hours  after  administration  of  multiple-dose  SST  30  mg  compared  to  1.00  hour  after 
administration  of  single  dose  SST  30  mcg.  Median  CST1/2  was  2.33  hours  regardless  of  whether 
observed  after  a  single-dose  or  multiple-dose  SST  30  mcg,  demonstrating  that  there  is  a  predictable 
and consistent offset after multiple dosing with SST 30 mcg. Geometric mean AUC0-60 of the last dose 
for multiple-dose SST 30 (113.30 h*pg/mL) was greater compared to single-dose SST 30 mcg (30.27 
h*pg/mL) and lower compared to AUC0-720 for single-dose SST 30 mcg (186.79 h*pg/mL). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Since sufentanil has been used in clinical practice for decades and the legal basis of the application is 
Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC (hybrid application) no new PD clinical studies are required and 
none were provided.  
No  studies  of  healthy  subject  or  patient  pharmacodynamics  were  conducted.  Pain  is  a  subjective 
disease  state  and  the  dose  and  plasma  concentration  required  for  pain  relief  is  highly  variable.  The 
sufentanil  sublingual  tablet  30  mcg  will  be  administered  by  a  Healthcare  Provider  to  the  patient  on  a 
“as  needed  basis  (ie  prn)”  but  no  more  frequently  than  every  60  minutes.  Given  the  prn  dosing 
regimen,  and  the  relatively  wide  variability  of  patient  interdosing  intervals,  it  was  not  relevant  to 
conduct a traditional PK/PD study as would be done with a fixed-dosing regimen product.  
Sufentanil  as  a  strong  and  efficacious  µ  opioid  receptor  agonist  possesses  all  the  well-known  opioid 
effects such as analgesia, respiratory depression, euphoria, miosis, nausea, sedation, constipation, etc. 
This  information  is  well-known  the  Applicant  has  not  focused  on  discussing  the  details.  Opioids  in 
general  has  almost  no  off-target  effects.  The  affinities  for  non-opioid  receptors,  enzymes  (including 
CYP monooxigenases) or transporters are limited or negligible. Therefore, the lack of information about 
secondary  pharmacodynamics  of  sufentanil  is  acceptable.  Sufentanil  can  interact  with  other  CNS 
depressants.  It  may  augment  the  CNS  depressant  effects  of  barbiturates,  tranquilizers,  opioids, 
general anesthetics, or other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence  was  shown  between  single-dose  SST  30  mcg  and 2  consecutive  doses of  SST  15  mcg 
(with 20 minutes between doses). To validate inclusion of patients in the safety database who re-dosed 
SST 15 mcg up to 25 minutes (ie, all 323 patients requested for inclusion from the Zalviso program) 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 23/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after  the  first  dose,  PK  modelling  was  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  effect  on  drug  concentrations 
when  the  second  dose  is  administered  25  minutes  after  the  first.  Based  on  the  absorption  profile  of 
sufentanil from the sublingual space, a 5-minute difference in timing of re-dosing a second SST (i.e., 
from the demonstrated bioequivalence of 2 x 15 mcg dosed 20 minutes apart to increasing this interval 
to 25 minutes) has negligible impact on the resulting sufentanil PK. Thus, this additional PK modelling 
has  demonstrated  that  the  bioequivalence  found  between  SST  30  mcg  and  two  SST  15  mcg  tablets 
dosed  within  20  minutes  of  each  other  is  maintained  if  the  inter-dosing  interval  for  the  15  mcg  SST 
tablets  is  extended  to  25  minutes.  Given  the  above  analysis,  and  since  the  majority  of  the  patients 
who dosed the second 15 mcg dose between 20 and 25 minutes also dosed a third SST 15 mcg within 
the  first  hour  of  dosing,  and  thus  received  a  50%  higher  dose  exposure  than  ARX-04  (SST  30  mcg), 
inclusion of these patients is justified. The additional clinical studies performed using ARX-04 (30 mcg) 
provide  a  total  safety  database  of  686  patients  for  ARX-04  (363  unique  ARX-04  patients  and  323 
Zalviso patients). 
The POP-PK model was validated, and the results are reported according to standards. The POP-PK of 
sufentanil sublingual tablets were described by the same two-compartment model with first-order oral 
absorption  and  a  lag  time  as  previously.  In  overall  it  seems  that  individual  characteristics  have 
moderate effects on the PK. Furthermore, the on-demand dosing makes the effect of the extrinsic and 
intrinsic  factors  on  the  PK  parameters  even  less  relevant.  Further  statistical  analysis  showed  that 
baseline pain intensity is the only factor which controls the dose rate.  
To understand the relationship between the maximum dose and the actual drug use, the Applicant was 
asked to compare the plasma sufentanil plasma levels following 15 and 30 µg SST tablets. The analysis 
showed that in the clinical trials with 15µg SST tablets the sufentanil plasma levels were higher.  This 
higher sufentanil exposure for the SST 15 µg product can be explained by three key factors: 
1)- The total possible hourly dosing with the SST 15 µg product is higher  
2)- The SST 30 µg product is not self-administered  
3)  -  The  SST  15  µg  studies  only  evaluated  patients  after  major  surgery  in  more  severe  conditions 
compared  to  patients  in  the  studies  with  SST  30  µg  tablets,  and  the  Applicant  showed  total  dose 
depends  only  on  the  intensity  of  the  postoperative  pain.    Patients  with  the  highest  pain  score  (7  or 
more) demand one tablet more in average compared to the patients at the other end of spectrum (the 
pain score is 1 or less).  
Dosage  recommendation  for  elderly  people  was  another  concern.      It  is  generally  held  that  the  pain 
threshold is generally higher in elderly.  Therefore, it is not expected that the exposure will be higher 
due  to  the  increased  demand.    POP-PK  analysis  revealed  that  the  clearance  decreases  with  age.  
However, older patients in the clinical studies were heavier and the clearance increases with the body 
weight, therefore the summary net of age is expected to be neutral. The Applicant sub-group analysis 
confirmed this expectation. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the available clinical pharmacology data were suitable to support the 
Application for a marketing authorisation of Dzuveo.  The product information adequately reflects 
relevant pharmacology data.

This was a multicentre, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients who had 
undergone an ambulatory abdominal surgery normally performed as an outpatient procedure: 
abdominoplasty; open-tension-free inguinal hernioplasty (Lichtenstein repair with mesh); or 
laparoscopic abdominal surgery.  
Following surgery, patients were assessed for pain intensity, vital signs, and oxygen saturation. 
Patients who continued to meet the entry criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment 
with sufentanil 30 mcg or placebo, stratified by sex at each study site. Before study drug could be 
administered, the patient must have reported a pain intensity (PI) of ≥ 4 just prior to the first dose of 
study drug (baseline PI). The time of the first dose of study drug was the start of the 48-hour study 
period. A qualified healthcare professional (HCP) administered study drug to the patient’s sublingual 
space using a single-dose applicator (SDA). Additional doses were administered by an HCP when 
requested by the patient over the next 48 hours, with a minimum re-doing interval of 60 minutes.  
SAP202: 
The study was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for 12 hours in 
patients 18 to 80 years of age who were undergoing bunionectomy alone or with hammertoe repair.  
Patients who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria following surgery were randomly assigned at a 
2:2:1 ratio to treatment with sufentanil NanoTab 20 mcg, sufentanil NanoTab 30 mcg, or placebo 
NanoTab. Randomization was stratified within each site by 2 age groups: 18 to 64 years and 65 to 80 
years.

Objectives 
SAP301: 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the sufentanil sublingual 
tablet 30 mcg to the placebo sublingual tablet. 
Secondary objectives were to assess patient ratings of pain intensity (PI) and pain relief (PR), time to 
perceptible and meaningful pain relief, percentage of patients requiring rescue due to inadequate 
analgesia, global assessments, and the use of rescue medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 26/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAP202: 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the repeat-dose efficacy of sufentanil NanoTab 
20 mcg and 30 mcg compared to placebo as determined by the time-weighted summed pain intensity 
difference (SPID) over the 12- hour study period (SPID12). 
Secondary objectives were to demonstrate the efficacy of sufentanil NanoTab 20 mcg and 30 mcg over 
the first hour (single-dose efficacy; SPID1), patient ratings of pain relief (PR), time to perceived 
analgesia, time to meaningful analgesia, percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesics due to 
inadequate analgesia, and patient global assessment (PGA) of effectiveness and tolerability. An 
additional secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sufentanil NanoTab 20 µg 
and 30 µg. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was the time-weighted SPID12 evaluated from the 
patient questionnaire data. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point NRS with 0 (no pain) and 
10 (worst possible pain). 
The pain intensity difference (PID) at each evaluation time point after the initiation of the first dose is 
the difference in pain intensity at the specific evaluation time point and baseline pain intensity [PID 
(evaluation time after the first dose) = PI(baseline) – PI(evaluation time after the first dose)]. The 
time-weighted SPID12 is the time-weighted summed PID over the 12-hour study period. 
Time-weighted SPID12 = Σ [T(i) – T(i-1)] x PID(i), 
Where: T(0) = Time 0 (baseline), T(i) is the scheduled or unscheduled assessment time, and PID(i) is 
the PID score at time i for i=0 to 12 hours.

SAP301: 
A sample size of approximately 180 patients (120 patients in the sufentanil 30 mcg treatment group 
and 60 patients in the placebo treatment group) was planned for this study assuming a 10% non-
evaluable rate to ensure at least 159 patients (106 sufentanil-treated patients and 53 placebo 
patients) received study drug and had available primary efficacy data for analysis. 
A sample size of 159 patients (106 sufentanil-treated patients and 53 placebo patients) was based on 
an effect size of 0.55 for the primary efficacy endpoint, time-weighted SPID12. This sample size had 
90% power to show statistical difference at significant level of 0.05 between two treatment groups. 
The time-weighted SPID12 is the time- weighted summed pain intensity difference measured over the 
12-hour study period. This calculation was based on a two-sided two-sample t-test with a two-to-one 
sample size allocation ratio and a significance level of α=0.05. Assuming a 10% non-evaluable rate, 
180 patients were expected to be randomized to this study. 
An intermediate data analysis was planned for this study based on study data collected from 
approximately 75 patients who had primary efficacy data, time-weighted SPID12. The mean time-
weighted SPID12 and its standard deviation (SD) for all patients combined were planned to be 
calculated based on this intermediate data set without unblinding the randomization treatment codes. 
SAP202: 
A sample size of approximately 110 patients was planned for this study to ensure at least 100 patients 
(40 patients in each of two sufentanil NanoTab treatment groups and 20 patients in placebo treatment 
group) received study drug and have available primary efficacy data for data analysis. A sample size of 
60 patients (40 patients in one sufentanil NanoTab treatment group and 20 patients in placebo group) 
was based on an effect size of 0.8 for the primary efficacy endpoint, time-weighted SPID12. This 
sample had 80% power to show statistical difference at significant level of 0.05 between two treatment 
groups. This calculation was based on a two-sided two-sample t-test with two-to-one sample size 
allocation ratio and a significance level of α = 0.05. To avoid an alpha level correction due to multiple 
comparisons, the sufentanil NanoTab 30 mcg treatment group was compared to placebo group first, 
followed by a comparison between the sufentanil NanoTab 20 mcg treatment group and placebo group 
only if the initial comparison reached a significant level of 0.05. Assuming a 10% non-evaluable rate, a 
total of 110 patients was expected to be randomized for this study. 
• 
Randomisation 
SAP301: 
A stratified randomization was applied in this study with sex as a stratification factor. Patients who met 
the eligibility requirements were randomly assigned, at a 2:1 ratio, into the sufentanil 30 mcg 
treatment group or placebo treatment group within one of two groups (male or female) at each study 
centre. 
SAP202: 
Patients who were deemed eligible for study participation were randomized at a 2:2:1 allocation ratio 
to receive sufentanil NanoTab 20 mcg, sufentanil NanoTab 30 mcg, or placebo NanoTab during the 12-
hour study period. Randomization was stratified within each site to 2 age groups: 18 to 64 years and 
65 to 80 years. An IWRS was used to assign the treatment for each patient. Patients were assigned the 
next available treatment within their strata at the time of randomization.

• 
Blinding (masking) 
SAP301: 
This was a double-blind study. AcelRx, the Investigator, other study centre personnel, and patients 
were blinded to treatment group assignment. Study drug for both treatments were identical in 
appearance. 
SAP202: 
The active and placebo NanoTabs were identical in appearance so that the Investigator and other study 
staff, the patients, and the Sponsor were all blinded to treatment group assignment. 
•  Rescue Medications 
SAP301: 
Rescue medication (1 mg IV morphine) could be given if the patient requested additional medication 
for pain beyond the use of the study drug. However patients with inadequate analgesia were 
encouraged to remain in the study without the use of rescue medication for at least 60 minutes after 
the first dose of study drug. The patient was to first receive a dose of study drug if it had been at least 
1 hour since the previous dose of study drug. After 10 minutes, if the patient was still requesting 
additional medication for pain, rescue medication (1 mg of IV morphine) could be given to the patient. 
If a dose of study drug had been given within 60 minutes, rescue medication could be given for pain 
once 10 minutes had passed since dosing with study drug. PI and PR scores must have been taken 
prior to all doses of rescue medication, in addition to the scores that were required at the specified 
time points based on when the first dose of study drug was given. 
Rescue medications were to be delivered as a slow IV push by an HCP. Patients could not receive a 
dose of rescue medication more frequently than once every 60 minutes. If a patient continued to have 
pain that was not controlled by the use of study drug or rescue medication, then the patient was to be 
discontinued from the study and an alternate form of post-operative analgesia per standard practice at 
the site was instituted. 
SAP202: 
Patients with inadequate analgesia were encouraged to remain in the study without the use of rescue 
medication (Vicodin [5 mg hydrocodone/500 mg acetaminophen]) for at least 60 minutes after the first 
dose of study medication. Patients were not allowed to use rescue medication until 10 minutes after 
any dose of study medication, and there was to be at least 4 hours between doses of rescue 
medication. A patient who received rescue medication was to keep receiving study medication (to be 
dosed with study drug at least 10 minutes prior to additional doses of rescue medication) and continue 
in the study with protocol-specified efficacy and safety measures collected.  
• 
Statistical methods 
Both studies: 
The primary null hypothesis to be tested was that the treatment difference in the least squares (LS) 
mean of the time-weighted SPID12 between each sufentanil NanoTab treatment group and placebo 
treatment group equals zero. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 30/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The statistical tests for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint were performed at the α = 0.05 
significance level. The statistical tests used for the analysis of baseline variables and secondary efficacy 
endpoints were performed at the α = 0.05 significance level. All tests are two-sided. 
Study population analysed: 
All randomized patients are those who were randomized to receive the study patient number and 
treatment assignment.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined for the analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy 
variables and included randomized patients who received study medication in studies: 
•  SAP301: A total of 163 patients were randomized and 161 received study drug and were 
included in the ITT and safety populations, 
•  SAP202:. A total of 101 patients were randomized into the study, and 100 patients received 
study medication. One randomized patients did not receive study medication. A total of 100 
randomized patients were considered as ITT patients for the analysis of the primary efficacy 
variable; 
The Completers population was defined for analysis of primary and secondary efficacy variables and 
included those ITT patients in studies 
•  SAP301 who completed at least the 24-hour study period per protocol (n=143 patients).  
•  SAP202 who completed the 12-hour study period per protocol (n=91); 
The analysis of efficacy data was based on the randomized treatment group, which was assigned to 
each patient. 
The safety population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. 
The summaries and analyses of safety data were based on the actual treatment that patients received 
during the treatment period. 
Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy variables: 
The main analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables included the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population.  
Rescue medication 
The PI collected after a patient received the first dose of rescue medication was included in the 
calculation of the primary efficacy endpoint, time-weighted SPID12.  
SAP301:  
For patients who used any rescue medication during the study period, the last observed pain data (PI 
or PR) prior to taking each dose of rescue medication was carried throughout a one-hour time interval 
following the dosing of rescue medication. 
SAP202:  
For patients who used any rescue medication during the 12-hour study period, the last observed PI 
prior to using each dose of rescue medication was carried throughout a follow-up 4-hour time interval. 
Any PI collected within 4-hour after the start of any rescue medication was excluded from the 
calculation of the primary efficacy endpoint, time-weighted SPID12.

The main analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints included the ITT population. The 
ITT population included all randomized patients who received study medication. For patients missing 
pain intensity or PR data, the following methods were applied to impute the missing data at evaluation 
time points for the study period: 
SAP301: 
 (1) Missing data were first imputed on a patient-by-patient basis using the linear interpolation method 
between two observed pain scale values. 
(2) For patients who used any rescue medication during the study period, the last observed pain data 
(PI or PR) prior to taking each dose of rescue medication was carried throughout a one-hour time 
interval following the dosing of rescue medication. 
(3) Missing pain data at follow-up time points post-termination up to the end of the study period were 
imputed on a patient-by-patient basis.  
SAP202: 
 (1) Missing data were first imputed on a patient-by-patient basis using linear interpolation method 
between two observed pain scale values. 
(2) Missing data after a patient terminated from the study or any missing follow-up data after last 
available data prior to the end of the study period, the pain scale values at follow-up time points post-
termination up to the end of the study period were imputed on a patient-by-patient basis as described 
below. 
The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute any remaining missing data 
points after termination due to reasons other than AE up to the end of the study period. For patients 
who prematurely terminated from the study due to AE, the worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
method was used to impute the remaining missing data points up to the end of the study period.

Conduct of the study 
Amendments: 
SAP301: There were 3 amendments (11 Aug 2014 to 20 Jan 2015) 
•  Study procedures and study visits; 
•  Dosing of rescue medication 
SAP202: There were 6 amendments of study (08 Aug 2011 to 08 Oct 2012). Most of these clarified: 
•  Study procedures and study visits; 
•  Definition of Clinically relevant respiratory depression (CRRD); 
• 
Exclusion and withdrawal criteria related to respiratory depression (incl. SpO2 maintained 
above 95% instead of > 90%). 
Protocol deviations: 
SAP301: There were several deviations that resulted in the adjustment of data: 
• Patients excluded from the analysis of efficacy and safety due to wrong stratification factor (One 
sufentanil arm) or patient randomized but not dosed (2 sufentanil arm) 
• Data adjusted for the derivation of efficacy outcome variable due to  
missing PI and/ or PR data (9 sufentanil, 7 placebo) 
PGA /HPGA not completed (19 sufentanil, 15 placebo) 
• Missing baseline SpO2 data (3 sufentanil).  Excluded from by-visit summary of SpO2 data. 
SAP202: There were 9 major protocol deviations. Five of these resulted in adjustment of data analysis:  
• One patient (sufentanil 20 mcg group) was randomized to treatment but not dosed due to residue 
found inside the treatment bottle. This patient was excluded from the ITT analysis of efficacy and 
safety data analyses 
• Four patients (1 in sufentanil 20 mcg group, 3 in sufentanil 30 mcg group) had missing pain 
intensity/relief data. Adjusted for the derivation of efficacy outcome variables. 
No action was taken for other types of deviations, which include deviations from rescue medication, 
missing PGA data, withdrawal criteria and medication kit error.

Key Secondary Endpoints: 
In addition to the primary SPID results, key secondary endpoint results support the efficacy of SST 30 
mcg. In the placebo-controlled studies, superiority of SST 30 mcg versus placebo was demonstrated 
for nearly all measures, including pain assessments, patient and HCP satisfaction measures, time to 
perceptible pain relief, and rescue/supplemental opioid use.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data were not integrated across studies because the 2 placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies used 
different  pain  models  (abdominal  surgery  [SAP301]  vs.  bunionectomy  [SAP202])  and  the  other  2 
Phase  3  studies  (SAP302  and  SAP303)  had  a  different  study  design  (open-label  studies).  Therefore, 
integrated data analyses not were performed, and statistical analyses were performed for each study 
individually. 
Due to the heterogeneity of the study designs other than a descriptive comparison cannot be done by 
pooling the study results. The comparison has been made in the Discussion section of this report. 
Supportive studies 
Two Phase 3 open-label safety and efficacy studies (SAP302, SAP303) were conducted with SST 30 μg. 
Study SAP302 enrolled 76 patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain due to injury or trauma in an 
emergency room (ER) setting with study drug treatment for up to 5 hours, and Study SAP303 enrolled 
140 postoperative patients aged 40 years or older who had undergone surgery and were expected to 
have  moderate-to-severe  acute  pain  for  at  least  12  hours.  Study  drug  was  administered  to  the 
patient’s sublingual space by a qualified HCP using the SDA. Both studies were conducted in the United 
States. 
Table: Phase 3 open-label studies 
The primary efficacy endpoints in each study, SPID1 for SAP302 (ER setting) and SPID12 for SAP303 
(orthopedic,  abdominal,  or  other  types  of  surgeries),  were  clinically  significant.  Efficacy  was  further 
supported by secondary endpoint results, including pain intensity, TOTPAR, PGA, HPGA, use of rescue 
medication,  and  dropouts  due  to  inadequate  analgesia.  In  both  studies,  reductions  in  pain  intensity 
and/or  improvement  in  pain  relief  were  observed  as  early  as  15  minutes.  In  addition,  a  post-hoc 
responder  analysis  of  SAP302  demonstrates  a  substantial  analgesic  response  to  a  single-dose  of  SST 
30 μg within 60 minutes (at 1 hour, a PI reduction ≥  30% was observed for 48.6% of patients and ≥  
50%  was  observed  for  36.8%  of  patients).  A  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in  pain  intensity  (mean 
Assessment report

drop of  2.9  to  5.2,  moderate  pain  [from  a  mean  baseline  score  of  severe  pain,  8.1])  was  achieved  1 
hour  after  administration  of  a  single  SST  30  μg  tablet.  Furthermore,  a  reduction  in  pain  intensity  of 
1.3,  previously  demonstrated  to  be  clinically  significant  in  ER  patients  (Bijur  2003),  occurred  on 
average within 20 minutes. In SAP303, from a mean baseline score of 6.2, a reduction in pain intensity 
of 1.7 was achieved by 1 hour and of 3.5 was achieved by 12 hours. 
Safety  and  efficacy  data  collected  and  submitted  as  part  of  the  Zalviso  (sufentanil  sublingual  tablet 
system;  SST  15  μg)  clinical  development  program  were  used  to  support  the  SST  30  μg  safety  and 
efficacy assessment. The 3 Zalviso Phase 2 studies and 3 Zalviso Phase 3 studies conducted with SST 
15  μg  were  conducted  in  patients  who  had  undergone  open  abdominal,  knee-replacement,  or  hip-
replacement surgery. 
One  of  the  studies  (IAP309)  of  SST  15  μg  compared  the  efficacy  of  the  SST  15  μg  (Zalviso)  to  IV 
patient-controlled  analgesia  (PCA)  with  morphine  sulfate  (MS).  The  IV  MS  regimen  was  a  standard  1 
mg dose, with a 6-minute lockout regimen. The original primary endpoint in this study was the patient 
global  assessment  of  the  method  of  pain  control  over  the  48-hour  duration  of  the  study  (PGA48). 
Zalviso  (SST  15  μg  no  more  frequently  than  every  20  minutes)  was  both  non-inferior  as  well  as 
superior  for  treatment  effect  to  IV  MS.  During  scientific  advice  discussions  with  several  European 
Health  Authorities  regarding  a  planned  European  marketing  authorisation  application  for  SST  30  μg, 
the Health Authorities recommended re-analyzing the efficacy data from IAP309 by comparing the IV 
MS group to only those SST 15 μg patients who dosed 30 μg or less (≤  2 doses of SST 15 μg) per 
hour.  Also,  analysis  of  earlier  efficacy  endpoints  (up  to  24  hours)  was  also  requested.  These patients 
represent a reasonable surrogate group for evaluating the efficacy of SST 30 μg versus a standard of 
care for treatment of severe pain (IV MS). The dosing of IV MS in this IAP309 study (a median use of 
10 mg IV within the first 3 hours) reflects typical dosing of IV MS in both the post-operative setting, as 
well as other settings in which IV MS is administered as an IV bolus by an HCP, such as in the ER. 
Similar  to  the  original  Phase  3,  active-controlled  study  IAP309  results  which  demonstrated  both  non-
inferiority as well as superiority of treatment effect of SST 15 μg compared to a standard IV PCA MS 
regimen  (1  mg  morphine;  6  minute  lockout)  based  on  the  pre-defined  primary  endpoint  of  PGA48 
(Study  IAP309  CSR),  results  of  the  re-analysis  (IAP309  Addendum)  showed  that  SST  ≤   30  μg/hour 
was at least as effective over 24 hours as IV MS for the management of acute post-operative pain in 
patients who had undergone major abdominal or orthopedic surgery. For the primary efficacy endpoint 
in  the  re-analysis  (good  or  excellent  response  on  the  PGA24),  non-inferiority  was  established  for  the 
SST ≤  30 μg/hour compared with IV MS. Additionally, the SST ≤  30 μg/hour showed superiority to 
IV MS based on the PGA24 and HPGA24 responses. In the first 24 hours after start of treatment, the 
SST  ≤   30  μg/hour  produced  significantly  better  pain  responses  than  IV  MS,  including  more  rapid 
onset of pain control. While this study was conducted in post-operative patients, the IV MS group self-
administered a median dose of 10 mg over the first 3 hours, which is not dissimilar to the total amount 
of  IV  MS  bolus  doses  administered  in  an  ER  setting  over  this  time  period.  Whereas  larger  and  less 
frequent boluses of IV MS may slightly shorten the time for morphine to reach the CNS compared to IV 
MS  1  mg  doses  administered  more  frequently  with  patient-controlled  analgesia,  the  very  slow 
plasma:CNS  equilibration time  of  morphine  (2.8  hours)  compared to  sufentanil  (6  minutes)  results  in 
an advantage for sufentanil with respect to onset of analgesia. Therefore, the efficacy results (original 
IAP309 study and post hoc analysis) for SST versus IV MS support the sought moderate to severe pain 
patient population who may currently be treated with bolus IV MS injections for their pain.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A  three-arm,  active  controlled  study  was  not  performed.  This  would  be  generally  required  to 
demonstrate  the  magnitude  of  the  clinical  effect  of  the  test  treatment  in  comparison  with  the  known 
effective treatments for the pain models being studied. In this case, however, performing such a study 
was  not  considered  feasible  due  to  the  specific  device  needed  for  delivery  of  the  sublingual  tablet. 
Blinding the study cannot be made in such case as the test product is applied by a specific device and 
the  reference  product  can  be  administered  intravenously  or  epidurally.  There  is  no  reference  product 
that would be indistinguishable from SST NanoTab 30μg tablet. 
Formal  dose-response  studies  have  not  been  performed.  The  Applicant  has  submitted  one  phase  2 
study,  SAP202,  which  was  also  intended  to  be  a  pivotal  efficacy  study.  In  addition  to  the  studies 
conducted by SST NanoTab sublingual sufentanil tablet administered by a health care professional the 
Applicant  has  submitted  full  reports  of  the  studies  already  assessed  in  the  marketing  authorization 
process  of  Zalviso.  These  studies  include  two  dose-finding  studies,  ARX-C-001  (sufentanil  doses  of  5 
μg, 10 μg and 15 μg in elective unilateral knee arthroplasty) and ARX-C-005 (sufentanil doses of 10 μg 
15 μg in open abdominal surgery). 
Two controlled, randomized, double-blind studies have been conducted. SAP 202 study was originally a 
dose  finding  phase  2  study.  However,  the  Applicant  has  not  performed  phase  3  study  to  prove  the 
efficacy of 30µg sufentanil in somatic pain, therefore this study serves as an efficacy study of somatic 
pain. As the statistical power is sufficient, this approach has been accepted.  
In study 202, the study population was representative to the whole human population in terms of age 
and gender. The total ITT population number is 100 disposed in three treatment arms (placebo, 20µg 
sufentanil,  30µg  sufentanil).  4  percent  (e.g.  4  patients  in  this  case)  were  at  least  65  years  old.  This 
small number of elderly patients does not make the subpopulation statistical analysis feasible and the 
Applicant has not performed such analysis either. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate. 
The  treatment  assignment  was  appropriate. 20  patients  received  placebo, 40  patients  received  20µg, 
40  patients  received  30µg  sufentanil.  The  use  of  rescue  medication  seems  sufficient  considering  the 
somatic  postoperative  pain  that  may  respond  well  to  a  combination  of  weak  opioids  and 
acetaminophen. 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were appropriate and generally accepted in pain studies. 
The total observation time of 12 hours was sufficient. Postoperative pain is declining by nature as the 
wound is healing there is no necessity to measure analgesic effects longer after this type of surgery. 
The sample size was sufficient in to detect statistically significant differences between groups. 
The  study  is  balanced  in  terms  of  gender,  however,  white  population  was  overrepresented.  Since 
opioids are generally efficient analgesics in the whole human population the race imbalance most likely 
does not bias the results. 
Study 301 study was designed and conducted as a phase 3 double-blind randomized, controlled trial to 
test 30µg sublingual sufentanil for postoperative visceral pain. 
The  study  population  and  treatment  was  appropriate:  A  total  of  163  patients  (109  sufentanil,  54 
placebo)  were  enrolled  and  randomized  in  this  study;  two  patients  (both  in  the  sufentanil  group)  did 
not receive study drug, leaving 161 patients who received study drug and were included in the ITT and 
safety  populations.  The  use  of  rescue  medication  (1  mg  IV  morphine)  was  sufficient  considering  the 
visceral postoperative pain.

The  amendments  of  the  protocol  are  adequate,  all  the  additions  and  clarifications  as  stated  in  Study 
Protocols are reasonable. Protocol deviations were handled appropriately. 
The  study  was  imbalanced  in  terms  of  gender  and  white  population  is  overrepresented.  There  were 
approximately double number of women than men. The relatively low number of males might result in 
ambiguous evaluation of efficacy in this subgroup. There were only two patients over 65 years of age. 
Since opioids are generally efficient analgesics in the whole human population the race imbalance most 
likely does not bias the results but subgroup analysis by gender might not be informative. 
In both double-blind controlled studies three statistical issues have emerged. 
Two of them were related to applied imputation method.  The Applicant provided   additional sensitivity 
analysis  which  proved  that  the  missing  data  imputation  method  had  a  small  effect  on  the  primary 
endpoints.   The impact of imputation method on the results was small because only   small percentage 
of the data had to be imputed.  Even using   a not realistic and extremely conservative approach gave 
clinically significant though statistically borderline results.   
A  special  case  of  missing  data  was  data  of  patients  who  used  any  rescue  medication.  When  this 
happened,  the  last  observed  pain  intensity  before  using  each  dose  of  rescue  medication  was  carried 
throughout a follow-up 1-hour time interval. This 1-hour time interval seemed short, and the statistical 
analysis  was  requested  assuming  that  the  rescue  medication  had  longer  effect.  It  has  been  clarified 
that  the  dose  of  morphine  was  lower  than  usual,  and  the  majority  imputed  period  length  was  much 
longer than one hour due to study design.   The Applicant also pointed out that   longer missing data 
period  would  be  anti-conservative  measure,  i.e.,  would  be  biased  toward  the  active  treatment  arm.  
These  points  were  considered  valid  arguments  and  it  was  accepted  that  further  statistical  analysis  is 
not needed. 
Concern  was  raised  that  in  study  SAP202  the  mean  percentage  of  observed  pain  data  that  was 
collected prior to the use of rescue medication was higher in the sufentanil groups than in the placebo 
group  (50.97%  for  SST  30  mg  vs  32.02%  for  SST  20  mg  vs  23.72%  for  placebo;  p  <  0.001  for  the 
overall comparison among groups).   The Applicant clarified that this difference was due to the specific 
features of the study design. The delay in the request of rescue medication was the proof of the clinical 
efficiency.    However,  the  perceived  pain  prior  the  rescue  medication  is  a  parameter  which  cannot  be 
easily  interpret.    This  scenario  adequate  for  a  Phase  2  study  but  does  not  reflect  the  intended  use.  
Because  of  that,  the  average  pain  until  the  rescue  medication  is  a  parameter  which      has  no  clinical 
relevance.  
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint showed the superiority of 30µg sufentanil administered 
sublingually by a health care professional for postoperative somatic and visceral pain to placebo.  
In  both  studies  the  secondary  endpoint  analysis  clearly  supports  the  conclusion  drawn  from  the 
primary efficacy endpoint. The analgesic effect can already be seen within the first hour. Sufentanil in 
30µg is superior to placebo in the analgesic effect against somatic and visceral postoperative pain.  
The most surprising data in study SAP202 in terms of withdrawal is the highest percentage inefficiency 
(7.5%) in the 30µg sufentanil group (3 patients).  In study SAP301 18 patients terminated the study 
within the first 24 hours, 5 from the sufentanil group an 13 from the placebo group. The most common 
reason in the placebo group was the lack of efficiency (10 patients). Lack of efficacy in the sufentanil 
group  was  the  reason  of  withdrawal  in  4  patients.  More  than  50%  of  the  patients  did  not  enter  the 
second period (24 hours – 36 hours) mostly due to discharge and recovery. 21 and 9 patients entered 
the  36  hour  -48  hour  period  from  the  sufentanil  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  All  patients

recovered  by  the  end  of  the  study  period.  During  the  whole  study  period  6  and  12  withdrawals 
occurred due to lack of efficacy from the sufentanil and placebo groups, respectively.  
The  Applicant  was  requested  to  compare  the  plasma  levels  of  sufentanil  in  patients  who  were 
withdrawn  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  (30µg  sufentanil  groups  in  both  studies)  with  the  ITT  population 
plasma  concentrations  especially  around  the  time-points  of  the  administration  of  rescue  medication 
and  summarize  the  pain  intensity  data  after  the  rescue  medication  to  see  whether  the  rescue 
medication  was  effective  or  not.  These  data  was  intended  to  clarify  whether  these  patients  did  not 
respond  due  to  insufficient  plasma  level  of  sufentanil  or  would  have  required  even  higher  dose  of 
sufentanil.   
In  SAP202  sufentanil  concentration  data  were  available  at  1  and  4-hour  time  points  for  all  three 
patients.  The  Applicant  proposes three  possible  reasons  of  lack  of  efficacy:  2  of  3  patients  had  lower 
plasma  levels  than  the  average  sufentanil  concentration  but  data  do  not  indicate  swallowing  the  pill 
instead  of  keeping  it  in  the  mouth.  Therefore,  it  can  be  considered  as  an  individual  difference  and 
lower sensitivity to opioids. The third patient had 53% concentration of the average sufentanil plasma 
level by the 4th hour but strangely the patient did not require frequent administration, the interdosing 
average interval was more than two hours (1 hour dosing interval was allowed as maximum). The lack 
of  efficacy  of  the  rescue  medication  (Vicodin  =  hydrocodone)  further  indicates  low  opioid  induced 
analgesic response. 
In SAP301 only one patient had no measurable sufentanil concentration that indicates swallowing, the 
other  6  patients  had  no  significantly  lower  sufentanil  exposure.  Again,  the  reason  of  lack  of  efficacy 
might be again a different individual sensitivity or, - considering the less than maximal possibilities of 
dosing - even patients’ misunderstanding of the way of using sufentanil. 
As these patients’ pain intensity scores did not change after taking sufentanil or rescue medication the 
Applicant’s  argumentation  about  the  need  for  multimodal  analgesia  can  also  be  considered.  One 
question was not answered by the Applicant, the possible need for even higher doses of sufentanil but 
this cannot be answered from the data of the studies. 
Generally  patients  in  the  30µg  sufentanil  groups  required  less  rescue  medication  although  the 
percentage was high in SAP202. Nevertheless, the time to the first rescue medication was significantly 
longer in both studies. 
The Applicant has provided a discussion about the clinical relevance of sublingually administered 30µg 
sufentanil  on  the  patient’s  request  with  a  maximum  hourly  frequency  in  postoperative  settings.  The 
Applicant was asked to provide a responder analysis as it could answer the clinical significance of the 
proposed analgesic medication.  
The  definition  of  the  clinically  meaningful  response  was  based  on  literature  data.  The  Applicant’s 
approach that instead of the absolute numbers the percentage difference was used is acceptable. 
For each trial diagrams plotting percentual pain intensity difference against the proportion of patients 
receiving the respective percentual difference were provided. Assuming that a 50% reduction could be 
regarded  as  a  relevant  effect  in  the  acute  pain  setting,  this  was  reached  in  the  12  h  interval  by  less 
than 20% in SAP 202, approximately 50% in SAP301 and more than 60% in SAP303 patients. In the 
1h  interval  50%  pain  reduction  was  reached  by  approximately  50%  of  the  patients  in  SAP  301.  The 
Applicant has provided a table summarizing the percentage of responders at 1 and 12 hour time points 
in three and at 1 hour time in one (emergency setting) studies.

The Applicant was also asked to justify the rationale for selecting a dosing interval of 1h between the 
30μg SST doses. The choice of 30µg sufentanil given hourly as maximum frequency has been based on 
the Zalviso studies where because of the 20 minutes lock-time and the 15µg sufentanil single dose the 
maximum  hourly  dose  of  sufentanil  could  be  45µg.  The  median  utilization  in  the  Zalviso  studies  was 
30µg sufentanil in an hour. The Applicant’s choice of dose was acceptable.  
Study  302  was  considered  to  be  supportive  for  efficacy  of  sufentanil  30  μg  sublingual  tablet.  Pain 
intensity  decreased  as  early  as  15  minutes  following  administration  of  treatment  and  pain  relief  was 
maintained 2 hours post-dose. Fast onset of effect is of paramount importance in emergency setting, 
however, the benefit of a sublingual tablet is not straightforward as most patients in emergency rooms 
must have i.v. canules, thus, i.v. administration of painkillers can also provide rapid onset of analgesic 
effect. Otherwise, due to small sample size, heterogeneity of population, open-label design and lack of 
comparator, this study provide limited additional evidence to the efficacy evaluation. 
Similarly,  study  303  is  also  supportive  for  efficacy  of  sufentanil  30  μg  sublingual  tablet.  In  this  case 
patients after abdominal or orthopaedic surgery received 30µg sufentanil and SPID12 was the primary 
efficacy endpoint. In this case the indication fits the intended indication of SST Nanotab 30μg pill. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was numerically higher in patients after abdominal surgery but the difference 
seems  insignificant.  Pain  intensity  decreased  as  early  as  15  minutes  or  30  minutes  following 
administration of treatment and pain relief continued to improve over 2 hours and the improvements 
were  maintained  throughout  the  12-hour  study  period.  Acknowledging  that  sublingual  sufentanil  can 
provide  an  as  rapid  as  15  minutes  onset  after  administration  the  benefit  is  not  unequivocal.  In  the 
postoperative period patients must have an iv. canule and i.v. administration of painkillers can provide 
an immediate onset of analgesic effect. Since both an intravenous analgesic both sufentanil sublingual 
pill is given by a health care professional even the benefit of the patient controlled analgesia is missing 
as  an  advantage.  Overall,  due  to  the  open-label  design  and  lack  of  comparator,  this  study  provided 
limited additional evidence to the efficacy evaluation. 
Study IAP309 was a multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial designed to compare the 
Zalviso System (SST 15 μg) to IV MS for at least 48 hours, and up to 72 hours if needed, in patients 
18  years  and  older  who  had  undergone  a  major  open  abdominal  surgery  (including  laparoscopic-
assisted  open  abdominal  procedures)  or  orthopedic  (total  knee  or  hip  replacement)  under  general  or 
spinal anesthesia that did not include intrathecal opioids during the operation. 
Reanalysis of study IAP309 compared the efficacy of the SST 15 μg to IV MS, by comparing the IV MS 
group to only those SST 15 μg patients who dosed 30 μg or less (≤  2 doses of SST 15 μg) per hour.

During  scientific  advice  discussions  with  European  Health  Authorities  regarding  the  SST  30  μg,  the 
Health Authorities recommended re-analyzing the efficacy data. 
The primary objective of the re-analysis was to evaluate whether the SST 15 μg was non-inferior to IV 
MS in the management of moderate-to-severe post-operative pain after major abdominal or orthopedic 
surgery as assessed by the PGA at 24 hours using a 4-point categorical scale with success defined as a 
report of “good” or “excellent” on the PGA24. 
This  post-hoc  analysis  of  the  Zalviso  study  IAP309  was  suggested  by  a  scientific  advice.  Indeed, 
comparing  paiteints  who  received  less  or  equal  than  2  of  15µg  sufentanil  sublingual  pills  in  the  first 
hour  of  the  postoperative  period  with  iv.  morphine  given  by  the  patients  with  an  infusion  pump  is 
reasonable.  The  results  showed  non-inferiority  (p<0.001)  and  superiority  (p=0.002)  of  sublingual 
sufentanil  to  iv.  morphine  in  the  primary  endpoint  (Patient  Global  Assessment,  PGA).  Secondary 
endpoints  also  indicated  non-inferiority  of  sublingual  sufentanil  to  iv.  morphine.  One  of  the  most 
interesting results of the analysis was the patients’ judgment about the onset of action that was faster 
in  the  sufentanil  group.  That  was  surprising  since  iv  administration  should  theoretically  provide  an 
immediate response. It must be noted though that the study was open-label which was unavoidable as 
the different ways of administration would have made blinding impossible. Therefore the patients were 
aware of the study drug and the new non-invasive  way of giving an analgesic might have resulted in 
higher  expectations.  The  way  of  the  treatment  of  postoperative  pain  was  also  different  as  in  study 
IAP309  PCA  (patient  controlled  analgesia)  was  applied.  Overall,  the  analysis  can  be  considered 
supportive for the current application. 
The anaesthesia methods and allowed postoperative medications were stricter in the controlled studies 
than in the open label ones. In SAP202 (bunionectomy) besides iv propofol or midazolam for sedation 
and iv. fentanyl as an analgesic the main anaesthetic procedure was a local metatarsal blockade. This 
in fact influenced the analgesic efficiency of sufentanil in the first three-four hours as an increase in the 
pain  intensity  could  be  observed  between  4  to  7  hours  postoperatively.  It  possibly  reduced  the  need 
for  sufentanil  in  the  first  4  hours  of  the  study.  The  same  problem  might  have  occurred  in  the  open 
label  uncontrolled  SAP303  study  in  patients  with  bunionectomy.  In  the  study  SAP301  general 
anaesthetic  procedures  were  applied  in  all  patients  and  no  additional  analgesics  were  allowed  after 
surgery  but  the  study  drug.  Therefore,  the  efficiency  of  sufentanil  was  not  altered  by  concomitant 
medication.  Since  patients  could  receive  their  first  sufentanil  dose  postoperatively  when  the  reported 
pain score reached 4 they were standardized and the general anaesthetic procedure obviously did not 
influence  the  analgesic  effect  of  sufentanil.  The  Applicant’s  response  is  clear  and  acceptable.  In  the 
study  SAP303  multimodal  analgesia  was  allowed  postoperatively  but  the  evaluation  of  the  impact  on 
sufetanil effect is highly limited due to the open label uncontrolled design of the study. 
Another  concern  was  raised  as  surgical  patients  need  to  sleep  at  night  and  an  administration  of  the 
drug  every  hour  will  obstruct  this.  Postoperative  pain  management  will  often  change  from  iv  to  oral 
medication with longer duration of action within the first hours postoperatively or a mixture of oral and 
iv administration. 
In  order  to  assess  the  true  effect  of  SST  30  ug/hour,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  provide  data 
regarding peroperative medication of the mentioned drugs. In the controlled efficacy studies no other 
analgesic  except  rescue  medication  was  used.  Antiemetics  were  used  when  needed,  dexamethasone 
was  not  administered.  In  study  SAP303  real-life  settings  were  allowed  but  the  effect  of  other 
analgesics cannot be evaluated as there was no comparison in that study

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In  the  pivotal  trials  30µg  SST  demonstrated  superiority  over  placebo  for  primary  endpoint  and  key 
secondary endpoints. Efficacy was rapid in onset and durable over time. Observed pain responses were 
clinically  meaningful.  The  data  obtained  from  the  clinical  development  of  Zalviso  can  be  accepted  as 
supportive for Dzuveo MAA evaluation.  
2.5.4.  Clinical safety 
Sufentanil has been available in the EU since 1978 and its safety profile is well characterised. Sufenta 
Forte solution for injection 0.05 mg/mL was approved in 1982 in Netherland for IV anesthetic use. The 
dosage and route of administration of Sufenta differs from that of the SST. Sufenta is administered IV 
at high doses for anesthesia and epidurally in conjunction with bupivacaine for analgesia. 
In  2014,  Grunenthal  (AcelRx  licensed  Zalviso  to  Grunenthal  in  the  EU)  presented  Zalviso,  a  15  µg 
sufentanil tablet combined with a PCA dosing system, which allowed patients to self-administer 15 µg 
sufentanil  tablets  sublingually  after  major  abdominal/orthopaedic  surgery.  In  Zalviso  Phase-3  clinical 
studies,  there  were  numerous  patients,  administering  sufentanil  doses  very  similar  to  that  in  the 
current  application  (i.e.  15  µg  over  20-25  minutes).  Applicant  was  intended  to  use  safety  data 
obtained  from  these  patients  to  support  the  present  application.  According  to  the  scientific  advice 
sought  from  FDA,  use  of  safety  data  obtained  from  Zalviso  patients  taking  15  µg  of  sufentanil  over 
every 20-25 minutes was considered acceptable only if cmax values were justified to be similar enough 
for  the  two  different  dosage  regimens  and  tablet  strengths.  According  to  Applicant's  data  obtained 
from SAP101 PK study this was the case. 
Key safety characteristics of reference product and Zalviso 
The  most  serious  adverse  reaction  of  sufentanil  is  respiratory  depression,  with  dose-related  severity 
and  potentially  leading  to  apnoea  and  respiratory  arrest.  Patients  at  higher  risk  are  those  with 
respiratory  impairment  or  reduced  respiratory  reserve.  Respiratory  depression  caused  by  sufentanil 
can  be  reversed  by  opioid  antagonists.  Repeat  antagonist  administration  may  be  required  as  the 
duration of respiratory depression may last longer than the duration of the effect of the antagonist. In 
Zalviso  clinical  studies,  nausea  and  vomiting  were  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions 
(≥1/10 frequency). 
Furthermore,  common  adverse  drug  reactions  identified  either  from  Zalviso  clinical  studies  or  from 
post-marketing  experience  of  other  sufentanil-containing  medicinal  products  were  confusional  state, 
dizziness,  headache,  sedation,  bradycardia,  hypotonia,  hypertonia,  constipation,  dyspepsia,  pruritus, 
involuntary muscle spasms and urinary retention.

The  total  pooled  patient  database  (All  Patient  Pool)  includes  363  patients  who  received  SST  30  mcg 
and 323 who received equivalent doses of SST 15 mcg (2 SST 15 mcg dosed within 20 to 25 minutes 
of each other). A total of 686 patients received SST 30 mcg or equivalent doses of SST 15 mcg for any 
length of time.  
Across all integrated studies, SST 30 mcg was received by: 
•  212 patients for ≥  6 hours 
•  94 patients for ≥  12 hours 
•  25 patients for ≥  24 hours 
•  1 patient for ≥  48 hours 
Equivalent doses of SST 15 mcg were received by: 
•  292 patients for ≥  6 hours 
•  255 patients for ≥  12 hours 
•  226 patients for ≥  24 hours 
•  101 patients for ≥  48 hours 
Pooling strategy 
The  pooled  analyses  include  data  collected  from  studies  conducted  under  the  ARX-04  program  and 
from  a  selected  patient  population  that  was  included  in  the  Zalviso  15  µg  marketing  application 
approved  in  April  2016  (EU/1/15/1042).  The  selected  Zalviso  population  includes  patients  who  self-
administered  Zalviso  (SST  15  µg)  or  placebo  with  the  second  dose  administered  within  20  to  25 
minutes  after  the  first  dose.  From  the  ARX-04  and  Zalviso  studies,  results  for  the  following  pooled 
groups are presented: 
•  Pool 1, All Patient Pool (N = 904) Analysis includes 5 treatment groups: SST 15 µg, SST 20 µg, 
SST 30 µg, ARX-04 placebo, and Zalviso placebo  
•  Pool  2,  All  ARX-04  Patient  Pool  (N  =  437).  Analysis  includes  2  treatment  groups:  SST  30  µg 
and ARX-04 placebo. 
•  Pool  3,  ARX-04  Placebo-controlled  Patient  Pool  (N  =  221).  Analysis  includes  2  treatment 
groups: SST 30 µg and ARX-04 placebo 
•  Pool  4,  Zalviso  Placebo-controlled  Patient  Pool  (N  =  315).  Analysis  includes  2  treatment 
groups: SST 15 µg and Zalviso placebo. 
•  Pool 5, Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool (N = 536). Analysis includes 2 treatment 
groups: combined SST (15 µg and 30 µg) and combined placebo (ARX-04 and Zalviso placebo)  
•  Pool 6, Open-label Study Pool (N = 328). Analysis includes 2 treatment groups: SST 15 µg and 
SST 30 µg.  
An additional comparative analysis between Sufentanil 30 µg patients and the above mentioned subset 
of Zalviso patient (N = 323) was also carried out. Within these patients, there was a subset who self-
administered  a  third  dose  of  the  SST  15  µg  in  the  first  hour  of  treatment  (ie,  45  µg/hour),  which 
exceeds  the  dose  of  sufentanil  received  from  the  maximum  SST  30  µg  dosage  of  1  tablet  per  hour. 
Safety  data  for  this  subset  who  received  3  doses  and  for  those  who  received  2  doses  are  presented

Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 placebo-controlled patient pool) 
In  Pool  3,  most  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  for  sufentanil  and  placebo 
groups.  However,  a  greater  number  of  patients  with  ASA  Class  I  and  Class  III  was  randomised  to 
placebo.  BMI  distribution  also  was  different  for  sufentanil  and  placebo  groups:  there  were  more 
patients  with  BMI<30  and  BMI  >40  in  the  sufentanil  groups.  Maximum  BMI  in  Pool  3  clinical  studies 
was much higher (53.5) in the sufentanil group than in the placebo group (39.2) 
Pool-2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
Across all pooled studies of SST 30 µg (All ARX-04 Patient Pool, Pool 2), compared with the subset of 
placebo-controlled  studies  of  SST  30  µg,  the  patients  were  generally  older  (mean  age  46.7  vs.  41.7 
years),  with  a  lower  ASA  class  (50.7%  vs.  63.9%  were  ASA  Class  I).  These  differences  are  largely

attributed  to  the  inclusion  criteria  of  the  different  studies,  particularly  the  open-label  study  SAP303, 
which enrolled patients 40 years or older. In addition, the placebo-controlled studies enrolled patients 
who underwent orthopaedic or abdominal surgery, (i.e. the indication in these studies was moderate to 
severe  post-operative  acute  pain)  while  the  open-label  studies  enrolled  patients  who  underwent  any 
type of surgery (SAP301, 303 and 202) or who had pain due to trauma or injury (SAP302). Proportion 
of  female  patients  in  sufentanil  groups  was  also  higher  for  ARX  04  placebo-controlled  pool  (Pool  3, 
63.3%)  than  for  All  ARX-04  pool  (Pool  2,  54.5%).  There  were  also  a  lower  proportion  of  Hispanic 
patients  (22.3%)  in  Pool  2  than  in  Pool  3  (32.0%).  Caucasian  patients  occurred  with  frequency  of 
52.9% in sufentanil groups in Pool 2 and 42.2% in Pool 3. 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
In  Pool  5,  most  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  for  sufentanil  and  placebo 
groups. There were more ASA Class I and Class III patients in the placebo groups, whereas more ASA 
Class  II  patients  were  randomised  to  sufentanil  groups  in  placebo-controlled  Sufentanil  30  SST  and 
Zalviso  studies.  More  patients  with  BMI  between  30  and  40  were  randomised  to placebo  groups,  and 
proportion  of  patients  with  BMI>40  is  higher  in  sufentanil  groups.  Maximum  BMI  experienced  in  the 
studies is also much higher in sufentanil group. 
Rescue therapy 
Rescue therapy IV morphine was used in SST 30 µg studies SAP 301 and SAP 303, IV morphine or oral 
oxycodone were used in study SAP 302 and oral hydrocodone-acetaminophen combination was used in 
study SAP202. Proportion of patients not requiring rescue medication varied from 30.0% (SAP202) to 
85.7% (SAP303, total).

Adverse event mapping was based on the MedDRA Version 11.0 thesaurus. A patient may be reported 
in more than 1 category. Adverse events occurring while patients are on study medication during the 
study treatment period or within 12 hours after the discontinuation of study medication are included in 
this  data  analysis  up  to  24  hours  after  first  dose  of  study  drug.  The  p-values  for  the  comparison 
between 2 treatment groups are based on a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test and presented if they are less 
than  0.1;  statistical  significance  was  defined  as  p  <  0.05;  therefore,  not  statistically  significant  p 
values  between  0.05  and  0.10  are  presented  in  the  table.  If  p  ≥  0.1,  difference  between  the  two 
treatment groups was considered as non-significant and was signed as NS in AE tables.

In Pool 5, patients who received either: 1) SST 30 µg or 2) 2 SST 15 µg dosed within 20-25 minutes of 
each other in the first hour of dosing were included. Inclusion of these patients in pooled analyses with 
SST 30 µg (ARX-04) is based on the establishment of bioequivalence of 1 SST 30 µg with 2 SST 15 µg 
dosed within 20 minutes of each other and PK modeling. All patients in this pool received 30 to 45 µg 
of sufentanil in 1 hour. 
Common adverse events 
Pool 3 
In  Pool  3,  AEs  experienced  by  >  5%  of  patients  receiving  the  SST  30  µg  were  nausea  (40.8%), 
headache (14.3%), vomiting (12.9%), dizziness (9.5%), and somnolence (7.5%). Results for this pool 
are  similar  to  results  for  the  Pool  5  discussed  below  and  consistent  with  those  expected  of  opioid 
treatment. 
Based  on  Fisher’s  exact  test  comparison,  2  common  AEs  occurred  statistically  significantly  more 
frequently  (p  <  0.05)  in  the  SST  30  µg  group  compared  with  the placebo  group:  Nausea  (40.8%  vs. 
21.6%, p = 0.005) Vomiting (12.9% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.005) Incidence of AEs dizziness and somnolence 
were both at least twice in the active treatment versus placebo. 
Pool 2 
In Pool 2, common AEs were generally consistent with those observed in the placebo-controlled studies 
of  SST  30  µg,  although  the  proportion  of  patients  with  AEs  was  lower  across  all  studies  than  in  the 
pooled placebo-controlled studies. For patients receiving SST 30 µg, 44.1% in all studies and 62.6% in 
placebo-controlled  studies  experienced  AEs.  In  the  SST  30  µg  group,  AEs  experienced  by  >  5%  of 
patients were nausea (28.9%), headache (8.0%), vomiting (6.3%), and dizziness (5.8%). 
Pool 5 
In  the  SST  group,  AEs  experienced  by  >  5%  of  patients  were  nausea  (43.9%),  vomiting  (11.7%), 
headache  (9.2%),  dizziness  (6.7%),  and  pruritus  (5.3%).  Overall,  more  patients  in  the  SST  group 
(69.0%) experienced AEs than patients in the placebo group (52.8%), and the most common AEs are 
consistent with those expected of opioid treatment given in a postsurgical setting.  
Common opioid-related AEs of oxygen saturation decreased, dizziness, somnolence, and pruritus were 
all at least twice the frequency of occurrence in the active treatment versus placebo, as were the AEs 
of  anemia,  tachycardia,  and  hyponatremia,  which  are  most  likely  attributed  to  the  postoperative 
setting. Specifically, the 7 patients with an AE of oxygen saturation decreased were all enrolled in the 
SST  15  µg  studies  (IAP310  and  IAP311),  with  6  experiencing  mild  oxygen  saturation  decreased  and 
continuing in the study and 1 experiencing severe oxygen saturation decreased and withdrawing from 
the study (study IAP311). 
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
Results  were  consistent  across  pooled  patient  populations,  as  the  most  common  AEs  in  all  pooled 
groups  were  generally  consistent  with  those  expected  of  opioid  treatment.  However,  AEs  were  more

common  in  patients  receiving  SST  15  µg  (80.8%  of  patients  experienced  AEs)  than  in  patients 
receiving  SST  30  µg  (44.6%  of  patients  experienced  AEs).  This  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  a 
generally younger population received the SST 30 µg, and over half of the patients treated with SST 15 
µg received a third dose in the first hour of treatment, which exceeds the dose of sufentanil received 
from  the  maximum  SST  30  µg  dosage  of  1  tablet  per  hour  (see  ISS  Section  10  for  additional 
discussion, including comparison of AEs between patients who received 2 or 3 doses of SST 15 µg). 
Pool  5  consists  on  safety  results  of  Zalviso  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  as  well  those  obtained 
from  Sufentanil  SST  30  µg  placebo-controlled  studies.  However,  incidences  of  common  AEs  did  not 
increase in a similar manner than in Zalviso patients taking 30-45 µg of sufentanil during one hour. 
Related AEs 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  based  on  investigator-determined  judgments  in  placebo-
controlled studies of the SST 30 µg (Pool 3) were experienced by 78 patients (53.1%) in the SST 30 µg 
group and 23 patients (31.1%) in the placebo group (p = 0.003). In the SST group, the most common 
treatment-related  AEs  (experienced  by  ≥  2%  of  patients)  were  nausea  (36.7%),  vomiting  (11.6%), 
dizziness  (9.5%),  headache  (8.2%),  somnolence  (6.8%),  hypotension  (3.4%),  pruritus  (2.7%),  and 
procedural  nausea  (2.0%).  Results  for  this  pool  are  similar  to  results  for  the  Combined  Placebo-
controlled, All Patients Pool discussed below. 
Pool 2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
Across  all  pooled  studies  of  SST  30  µg,(Pool  5)  AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  were 
generally consistent with those observed in the placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg, although the 
proportion  of  patients  with  treatment-related  AEs  was  lower  across  all  studies  than  in  the  pooled 
placebo-controlled  studies  of  SST  30  µg.  For  patients  receiving  SST  30  µg,  36.9%  in  all  studies  and 
53.1% in placebo-controlled studies experienced AEs. In the SST group, the most common treatment-
related AEs (experienced by ≥ 2% of patients) were nausea (26.7%) and vomiting (5.8%). 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  based  on  investigator-determined  judgments  in  the 
combined  placebo-controlled  studies  of  SST  30  µg  and  SST  15  were  experienced  by  179  patients 
(50.0%)  in  the  SST  group  and  55  patients  (30.9%)  in  the  placebo  group  (p  <  0.001).  In  the  SST 
group,  the  most  common  treatment-related  AEs  (experienced  by  ≥  2%  of  patients)  were  consistent 
with  expected  AEs  of  opioid  treatment  and  included  nausea  (33.2%),  vomiting  (10.3%),  dizziness 
(6.1%), headache (4.7%), pruritus (3.9%), somnolence (3.6%), and hypotension (2.8%). 
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
Results  were  consistent  across  pooled  patient  populations,  as  the  treatment-related  AEs  in  all  pooled 
groups were generally consistent with those expected of opioid treatment and the treatment settings. 
However,  treatment-related  AEs  were  more  common  in  patients  receiving  SST  15  µg  (55.1%  of 
patients experienced  treatment-related  AEs)  than  in  patients  receiving  SST  30  µg  (37.2%  of  patients 
experienced  treatment-related  AEs).  This  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  a  generally  younger 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018

population  received  the  SST  30  µg,  and  over  half  of  the  patients  treated  with  SST  15  µg  received  a 
third  dose  in  the  first  hour  of  treatment,  which  exceeds  the  dose  of  sufentanil  received  from  the 
maximum  SST  30  µg  dosage  of  1  tablet  per  hour  (see  ISS  Section  10  for  additional  discussion, 
including comparison of AEs between patients who received 2 or 3 doses of SST 15 µg). 
AEs by severity 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
In placebo-controlled studies of the SST 30 µg,(Pool 3) most AEs were judged to be mild in severity. In 
the SST 30 µg group, moderate AEs experienced by ≥ 2% of patients were nausea (25.2%), headache 
(4.8%), vomiting (4.8%), flatulence (2.7%), dizziness (2.0%), and somnolence (2.0%). In the placebo 
group,  moderate  AEs  experienced  by  ≥  2%  of  patients  were  nausea  (16.2%),  headache  (6.8%), 
flatulence (5.4%), and somnolence (2.7%). 
For  severe  AEs,  those  experienced  by  >  1%  of  patients  in  the  SST  30  µg  group  were  nausea, 
procedural  nausea,  and  procedural  vomiting,  each  experienced  by  2  patients  (1.4%).  In  the  placebo 
group,  severe  AEs  experienced  by  >  1%  of  patients  were  hemiparesis  and  procedural  nausea,  each 
experienced by 1 patient (1.4%). 
Pool 2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
The severity of AEs observed in all pooled studies of SST 30 µg (Pool 2) was generally consistent with 
that  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  of  SST  30  µg.  Only  1  severe  AE  (nausea  in  1.1%  of 
patients) and 4 moderate AEs (nausea in 12.7%, headache in 2.5%, vomiting in 1.9%, and flatulence 
in 1.1%) were experienced by > 1% of patients receiving SST 30 µg in these studies.  
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
In  the  combined  placebo-controlled  studies  of  SST  30  µg  and  SST  15  µg  (Pool  5),  most  AEs  were 
judged to be mild in severity. In the SST group, moderate AEs experienced by ≥ 2% of patients were 
nausea  (23.2%),  vomiting  (4.5%),  headache  (3.9%),  dizziness  (2.2%),  pruritus  (2.0%),  and  pyrexia 
(2.0%). In the placebo group, moderate AEs experienced by > 2% of patients were nausea (15.2%), 
headache  (2.8%),  and  flatulence  (2.2%).  The  moderate  and  severe  AEs  reported  are  consistent  with 
those expected of opioid treatment and the postsurgical setting.  
In Pool 5, No severe AEs were experienced by more than 1% of patients in either the SST or placebo 
group, and the only severe AE experienced by more than 2 patients was nausea, which was reported 
for 3 patients in the SST group. The severe AE of respiratory rate decreased occurred in an SST 30 µg-
treated  patient  (study  SAP202)  and  the  severe  AE  of  oxygen  saturation  decreased  occurred  in  a  SST 
15  µg-treated  patient  (study  IAP311;  she  actually  self-administered  14  doses  of  15  µg  sublingual 
nanotab during cca 6 hours).  
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
In  Zalviso  Placebo-controlled  Patient  Pool  (Pool  4)  one  severe  AE  (oxygen  saturation  decreased 
occurred  within  the  first  24  hours  of  the  study;  this  severe  AE  is  identical  to  that  in  Study  IAP311 
mentioned above. Other AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018

In  case  of  common  AEs,  related  AEs  as  well  as  for  analysis  of  AEs  in  severity  incidences  of  these  AE 
types were lower for All ARX-04 Patient Pool (Pool 2) than for ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool 
(Pool 3) as well as for Combined Placebo-controlled All Patients Pool (Pool 5, this pool contains Zalviso 
patients  taking  30-45  µg  of  sufentanil  during  one  hour).  Same  safety  results  were  rather  similar  for 
Pool 3 and Pool 5. 
AEs of special interest 
AEs associated with the use of sufentanil were grouped into 3 areas of special interest for an in-depth 
analysis:  respiratory  events,  neuropsychiatric  events,  and  gastrointestinal  events.  Most  of  the  AEs  of 
special interest observed with the SST were mild to moderate and self-limited, and no opioid reversal 
agents  (eg,  naloxone)  were  required  for  any  patient  receiving  SST  30  µg  throughout  all  Phase  2  or 
Phase 3 studies. 
Analysis  of  AEs  of  special  interest  was  presented  for  Pool  3  and  Pool  5  as  well  as  for  Zalviso  studies 
pool, but not for Pool 2 (All SST 30 µg patient pool).  
Respiratory events 
As  with  any  opioid,  SST  may  be  associated  with  respiratory  events,  particularly  in  a  post-operative 
setting  where  patients  are  recovering  from  anesthesia  or  have  been  administered  concomitant  CNS 
depressants,  including  other  opioids  during  the  surgery  and  during  the  initial  stay  in  the  recovery 
room. Also, the use of rescue opioids confounds the assessment of AEs. 
Vital signs and physical finding linked to respiratory adverse events are also discussed in this section. 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
Most of the respiratory events seen with the SST were mild to moderate and self-limited. Only 1 event 
in  the  placebo-controlled studies  of  the  SST  30  µg  was  considered  to  be  severe  and  related  to  study 
treatment  by  investigators.  Opioid  reversal  agents  (eg,  naloxone)  were  not  required  for  any  patient 
receiving  SST  30  µg  in  these  studies.  Respiratory  AEs  by  SOC  and  PT  in  the  SST  30  group  were  the 
following: respiratory rate decreased (Investigations) in one patient, and hypoxia (Respiratory Thoracic 
and Mediastinal Disorders) in one patient. 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
Most  of  the  respiratory  events  seen  with  SST  were  mild  to  moderate  and  self-limited,  with  only  2 
events  considered  to  be  severe  and  related  to  study  treatment  by  investigators.  The  severe  AE  of 
respiratory  rate  decreased  occurred  in  an  SST  30  µg-treated  patient  (study  SAP202;  patient  #1962 
narrative) and the severe AE of oxygen saturation decreased occurred in an SST 15 µg-treated patient 
(study IAP311; patient #8901 narrative). Opioid reversal agents (eg, naloxone) were not required for 
any patient receiving SST 30 µg throughout all Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies (placebo-controlled or non-
controlled studies). 
Respiration rate 
Across  studies  of  the  SST,  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  respiration  rate  were  generally  small  and 
not clinically meaningful. However, some respiratory AEs were reported and discussed above.

Oxygen saturation 
The lowest oxygen saturation values were identified for each patient and summarized. The mean and 
median  lowest  oxygen  saturation  values,  as  well  as  the  numbers  and  percentages  of  patients  with 
lowest  values  <  and  ≥  95%,  <  and  ≥  93%,  and  <  90%,  and  from  90  to  92%  and  93  to  94%,  are 
presented for each pooled group. Note that in order to maintain oxygen saturation at 95%, the study 
protocols required supplemental oxygen to be available to patients receiving study treatment. 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
In placebo-controlled studies of the SST 30 µg (Pool 3), the mean (SD) lowest oxygen saturation in the 
SST group was 95.4% (1.4%). This value significantly higher in the placebo group at 96.1% (1.2%) (p 
<  0.001).  In  addition,  higher  proportions  of  patients  in  the  SST  group  as  compared  to  the  placebo 
group had lowest oxygen saturation values < 95% (17.7% vs 5.4%; p = 0.012) and < 93% (5.4% vs. 
0%;  p  =  0.041).  There  were  no  oxygen  saturation  values  <  90%  and  no  AEs  of  oxygen  saturation 
decreased in the placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg. 
Pool 2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
Across all pooled studies of the SST 30 µg,(Pool 5) the mean (SD) lowest oxygen saturation of 95.5% 
(1.7%)  in  patients  receiving  the  SST  30  µg  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled 
studies  (95.4%  [1.4%]).  Across  all  pooled  studies  of  SST  30  µg,  lowest  oxygen  saturation  values  < 
95% were observed in 47 patients (12.9%), < 93% were observed in 17 patients (4.7%), and < 90% 
were  observed  in  4  patients  (1.1%).  No  patients  throughout  the  ARX-04  Phase  2  or  Phase  3  studies 
required the use of opioid reversal agents (eg, naloxone). 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
The  mean  (SD)  lowest  oxygen  saturation  in  the  SST  group  was  95.0%  (3.4%);  this  value  was 
significantly higher in the placebo group at 95.7% (1.6%) (p = 0.001). In addition, somewhat higher 
proportions  of  patients  in  the  SST  group  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group  had  lowest  oxygen 
saturation values < 95% (19.8% vs 15.2%), < 93% (7.8% vs. 3.9%), and < 90 (1.1% vs. 0%). The 
lowest oxygen saturation value recorded in the SST group was 40%, in a patient receiving SST 15 µg 
in  IAP311.  This  patient  was  discontinued  due  to  a  severe  SAE  of  oxygen  saturation  decreased  which 
resolved after treatment with naloxone. The next lowest oxygen saturation value for patients receiving 
the  SST  in  this  patient  pool  was  83%  in  a  patient  receiving  SST  15  µg,  and  the  lowest  oxygen 
saturation  value  for  a  patient  receiving  SST  30  µg  in  these  studies  was  91%.  Overall,  4  patients 
(1.1%)  receiving  the  SST  in  placebo-controlled  studies  had  lowest  oxygen  saturation  values  <  90%. 
AEs  of  oxygen  saturation  decreased  were  reported  for  7  patients  (2.0%)  receiving  the  SST  in  these 
studies, of which 1 was considered an SAE and led to discontinuation from the study. 
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
Across  all  pooled  studies,  the  mean  (SD)  lowest  oxygen  saturation  values  were  generally  similar  for 
each SST group (94.2% [3.9%] for SST 15 µg, 95.8% [1.0%] for SST 20 µg, and 95.4% [1.8%] for 
SST 30 µg). It is noted that a generally younger population received the SST 30 µg than received the 
SST 15 µg, and over half of the patients treated with SST 15 µg received a third dose in the first hour

of treatment, which exceeds the dose of sufentanil received from the maximum SST 30 µg dosage of 1 
tablet per hour. 
Subgroup analyses 
The lowest oxygen saturation values are also presented by age (age < 55 years, 55 to < 65 years, 65 
to < 75 years, and ≥ 75 years) and BMI (BMI < 30 kg/m2, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and ≤ 40 kg/m2, and BMI 
> 40 kg/m2).  
Lowest oxygen saturation by age 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
In placebo-controlled studies of the SST 30 µg (Pool 3), there were 192 patients aged < 55 years, 24 
aged  55  to  <  65  years,  and  5  aged  65  to  <  75  years.  Statistically  significant  differences  in  lowest 
oxygen  saturation  between  the  SST  and  placebo  were  only  observed  in  the  group  of  patients  <  55 
years  of  age,  for  oxygen  saturation  <  95%  (p  =  0.013)  and  mean  lowest  oxygen  saturation  (p  < 
0.001).  In  the  conditions  and  populations  under  study  and  in  the  limited  number  of  patients  ≥  55 
years  of  age  in  this  patient  pool,  no  pattern  of  additional  oxygen  desaturation  risks  was  observed  in 
older as compared with younger patients. 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
In the combined placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg and SST 15 µg, there were 265 patients aged 
<  55  years,  121  aged  55  to  <  65  years,  90  aged  65  to  <  75  years,  and  60  aged  ≥  75  years. 
Statistically significant differences in lowest oxygen saturation between the SST and placebo were only 
observed in the group of patients < 55 years of age, for oxygen saturation < 93% (p = 0.020) and < 
95% (p = 0.002) and mean lowest oxygen saturation (p < 0.001). 
In  patients  who  received  the  SST,  the  mean  (SD)  lowest  oxygen  saturation  was  somewhat  lower  in 
patients 65 to < 75 years (94.3% [7.0%]) and ≥ 75 years (94.5% [2.0%]) than in patients < 55 years 
(95.3%  [1.7%])  and  55  to  <  65  years  (95.2%  [1.6%]),  but  statistically  significant  differences  from 
placebo were only observed in patients < 55 years. In the conditions and populations under study, no 
pattern  of  additional  oxygen  desaturation  risks  was  observed  in  older  as  compared  with  younger 
patients. 
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
As  for  the  Combined  Placebo-controlled,  All  Patients  Pool  and  ARX-04  Placebo-controlled  Patient  Pool 
discussed above, no pattern of additional oxygen desaturation risks was observed in older as compared 
with younger patients for Zalviso patient pools. 
Lowest oxygen saturation by BMI 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
In  placebo-controlled  studies  of  the  SST  30  µg  (Pool  3),  there  were  153  patients  with  a  BMI  <  30 
kg/m2,  63  with  a  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2  and  ≤  40  kg/m2,  and  5  with  a  BMI  >  40  kg/m2.  Statistically 
significant  differences  in  mean  lowest  oxygen  saturation  between  the  SST  30  µg  and  placebo  were 
observed in patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 (p = 0.014) or 30 to 40 kg/m2 (p = 0.005); none of the 5 
patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 received placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018

A greater proportion of patients receiving the SST with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 than with a BMI from 30 to 
40  kg/m2  had  a  lowest  oxygen  saturation  <  93%  (5.7%  vs.  2.7%)  or  <  95%  (19.0%  vs.  13.5%), 
although the greatest proportion of patients with a lowest oxygen saturation < 93 or 95% (20%) had a 
BMI > 40 kg/m2. This differs from the Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool discussed below, 
in  which  a  smaller  proportion  of  patients  receiving  the  SST  with  a  BMI  <  30  kg/m2  than  with  a  BMI 
from 30 to 40 kg/m2 or > 40 kg/m2 had a lowest oxygen saturation < 93%. 
Overall patient number in Pool 3 was rather low, especially in BMI between 30-40 kg/m2 and above 40 
kg/m2  categories.  Therefore  it  is  hard  either  to  draw  any  conclusion  from  the  results  of  oxygen 
saturation  in  BMI  subgroups  or  give  any  explanation  of  the  difference  in  the  results  of  BMI  subgroup 
analysis for Pool 3 and Pool 5 (see below). 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
In the combined placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg and SST 15 µg, there were 320 patients with 
a  BMI  <  30  kg/m2,  183  with  a  BMI  ≥30  kg/m2  and  ≤  40  kg/m2,  and  33  with  a  BMI  >  40  kg/m2. 
Statistically  significant  differences  in  mean  lowest  oxygen  saturation  between  the  SST  and  placebo 
were observed in patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 (p = 0.004) or 30 to 40 kg/m2 (p = 0.044) but not in 
patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m2. Patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had mean lowest oxygen saturation 
values lower than those with a BMI < 30 kg/m2. 
Comparing patients receiving the SST in the different BMI groups, the proportion with a lowest oxygen 
saturation < 93% was lowest in patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 (5.5% had a lowest oxygen saturation 
< 93%) and higher for patients with a BMI from 30 to 40 kg/m2 (11.4%) or > 40 kg/m2 (11.5%). In 
patients with a BMI 30 to 40 kg/m2, statistically significantly more patients receiving the SST 30 µg as 
compared to placebo had a lowest oxygen saturation < 93% (p = 0.042). 
Comparison with Zalviso patient pools 
In  this  pool,  there  were  167  patients  with  a  BMI  <  30  kg/m2,  120  with  a  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2  and  ≤  40 
kg/m2,  and  28  with  a  BMI  >  40  kg/m2.  No  statistically  significant  differences  from  placebo  were 
observed  in  any  of  the  BMI  groups.  As  in  the  Combined  Placebo-controlled,  All  Patients  Pool,  the 
proportion of patients receiving the SST with a lowest oxygen saturation < 93% was lowest in patients 
with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 (5.3% had a lowest oxygen saturation < 93%) and higher for patients with a 
BMI from 30 to 40 kg/m2 (15.6%) or > 40 kg/m2 (9.5%). 
Neuropsychiatric events 
Neuropsychyatric AEs were defined as AE belonging to SOC Nervous System and Psychiatric Disorders. 
As with any opioid, SST may be associated with neuropsychiatric events, particularly in a postoperative 
setting  where  patients  are  recovering  from  anaesthesia  or  have  been  administered  concomitant  CNS 
depressants  or  medications  with  psychoactive  effects.  However,  most  of  the  neuropsychiatric  events 
seen with SST were mild to moderate and self-limited, and no neuropsychiatric events of interest were 
considered to be severe and related to study treatment by investigators. 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
AEs assigned to Nervous system disorders SOC occurred with an overall frequency of 27.9% in SST 30 
µg  group.  Although  the  difference  between  SST  and  placebo  groups  was  assigned  as  non-significant 
(NS)  for  all  AEs  in  Neuropsychyatric  AEs  group,  a  trend  for  more  than  twofold  higher  AE  frequencies 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 69/85 
 
 
 
 
 
can be observed in SST 30 µg group, when it is compared to placebo group. Note that NS means that 
p-value is greater than 0.10 for the given AE frequency.  
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
Trends  of  AE  frequency  difference  are  similar  to  that  observed in  Pool  3,  although  absolute  values  of 
AE frequencies are somewhat lower in Pool 5 than in Pool 3. Frequency values might be more reliable 
for Pool 5, than for Pool 3 due to the higher patient number in Pool 5. 
Gastrointestinal events 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
There  were  2  gastrointestinal  events  of  interest in  patients  receiving the  SST  30  µg  considered  to  be 
severe  and  related  to  study  treatment  by  investigators.  Statistically  significant  differences  observed 
between  the  SST  and  placebo  groups  for  nausea  (40.8%  and  21.6%,  respectively)  and  vomiting 
(12.9% and 1.9%, respectively). P values were 0.005 for both AEs. 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
While  gastrointestinal  events  with  SST  or  placebo  were  common,  only  3  gastrointestinal  events  of 
interest in patients receiving the SST were considered to be severe and related to study treatment by 
investigators.  Statistically  significant  differences  between  the  SST  and  placebo  groups  were  seen  for 
nausea  (43.9%  and  27.5%,  respectively)  and  vomiting  (11.7%  and  2.8%,  respectively)  based  on 
Fisher’s exact test comparison. P values were 0.005 for both AEs. 
AE  and  related  AE  frequencies  were  similar  for  GI  AEs  and  related  AEs  nausea  and  vomiting  for 
sufentanil  groups  between  Pool  3  and  Pool  5.  Number  of  patients  experiencing  severe  GI  adverse 
events  were  exactly  the  same  for  Pool  3  and  Pool  5,  these  were  obviously  the  same  patients. 
Frequency  of  nausea  in  placebo  groups  was  somewhat  higher  for  Pool  5  (27.5%)  than  for  Pool  3 
(21.6%).  Higher  patient  number  in  Pool  5  allowed  to  detect  some  lower  occurrence  AEs  as 
constipation,  dyspepsia  and  abdominal  distension  in  sufentanil  group;  most  of  them  were  also 
considered as treatment-related by the investigator. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
SAEs were followed in placebo-controlled studies of the SST 30 µg (Pool 3) for the 24-hour period after 
the  first  dose  .  During  this  period,  no  patients  receiving  SST  30  µg  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled 
studies  experienced  SAEs.  In  the  placebo  groups,  one  patient  experienced  a  SAE  of  hemiparesis  and 
another patient experienced a SAE of syncope. These were the same two patients mentioned above in 
SAEs/Pool 2 subsection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 70/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pool 2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
Across all pooled studies of SST 30 µg, only 1 patient receiving SST 30 µg experienced a SAE (angina 
pectoris). Two patients from the placebo groups experienced SAEs of hemiparesis and syncope. 
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
SAEs  were followed in the combined placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg and SST 15 µg (Pool 5) 
for  the  24-hour  period  after  the  first  dose.  During  this  period,  SAEs  were  experienced  by  only  4 
patients,  including  2  (0.6%)  in  the  SST  group  and  2  (1.1%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Two  patients 
experienced SAEs in the SST group within 24 hours of the first dose (1 patient with oxygen saturation 
decreased, and 1 patient with confusional state, hypoxia, and pulmonary embolism). 
There were no deaths in studies of SST 30 µg.  
In  the  Zalviso  (SST  15  µg)  clinical  program,  there were  2 deaths,  both  of  which  occurred  at least  18 
days  after  discontinuation  of  study  drug  and  were  considered  unrelated  to  treatment  by  the  study 
investigator.  One  patient  died  of  severe  sepsis  after  receipt  of  active-comparator  treatment  of  IV 
morphine  (study  IAP309)  and  the  other  died  of  acute  renal  failure  after  receipt  of  SST  15  µg  (study 
ARX-C001; patient 4202). Patient 4202 was a 69-year-old white female who had an elective unilateral 
total knee replacement and died of acute renal failure 30 days after discontinuing SST 15 µg. 
Laboratory findings 
Safety  laboratory  assessments  were  not  performed  in  the  SST  30  µg  studies  SAP301,  SAP302, 
SAP303, or SAP202. However, in SAP303, a screening blood sample was obtained from each patient to 
categorize  the  patient’s  renal  and  hepatic  function,  and  AEs  by  renal  and  hepatic  function  are 
presented in Section 4.5 (Safety in special populations). 
In  the  studies  of  SST  15  µg,  no  findings  for  clinical  laboratory  values  or  changes  were  considered 
clinically  significant.  Some  laboratory  assessment  results  were  reported  as  AEs  and  were  generally 
expected for this postoperative subject population and were not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Rates of these AEs were comparable between the SST and placebo groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
AcelRx conducted 1 formal pharmacokinetic study (IAP104) assessing the effect of a CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(ketoconazole) on the SST. Co-administration of SST 15 µg and oral ketoconazole 400 mg resulted in 
effects  on  area  under  the  curve  (AUC),  time  to  maximum  plasma  concentration  (Tmax),  and  half-life 
(t½).  There  was  only  a  small  effect  on  maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  and  no  effect  on 
context-sensitive  half-time  (CST½).  Given  the  as-needed dosing  schedule  of  the  SST,  the  differences 
observed  are  unlikely  to  be  clinically  significant.  However,  proposed  labeling  contains  a  warning 
regarding concomitant use of the SST 30 µg with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Additional drug interactions for sufentanil include the following:  
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 71/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  depressants:  The  concomitant  use  of  CNS  depressants  including 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or other opioids, halogen gases or other non-selective CNS 
depressants (eg, alcohol) may enhance respiratory depression.  
• Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: Discontinuation of MAO inhibitors is generally recommended 2 
weeks before treatment with Zalviso, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors 
has been reported with opioid analgesics.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pool 3 (ARX-04 Placebo-controlled Patient Pool) 
In  placebo-controlled  studies  of  the  SST  30  µg  (Pool  3),  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
experienced by 2 patients (1.4%) in the SST 30 µg group and 2 patients (2.7%) in the placebo group. 
No  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  more  than  1  patient  receiving  SST  30  µg.  Similarly  to 
results  for  the  Combined  Placebo-controlled,  All  Patients  Pool  discussed  above,  there  were  few  AEs 
leading to discontinuation. 
Pool 2 (All ARX-04 Patient Pool) 
AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  observed  in  all  pooled  studies  of  SST  30  µg  (Pool  2))  were  generally 
consistent with those observed in the placebo-controlled studies of SST 30 µg. In the SST 30 µg group, 
only  1  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  (oxygen  saturation  decreased  in  2  patients  [0.6%])  was 
experienced by more than 1 patient.  
Pool 5 (Combined Placebo-controlled, All Patients Pool) 
Overall,  there  were  few  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation.  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
experienced by 13 patients (3.6%) in the SST group and 6 patients (3.4%) in the placebo group and 
were consistent with expected AEs of opioid treatment and the postsurgical setting. In the SST group, 
the only AEs leading to discontinuation experienced by more than 1 patient were nausea and sedation 
in 3 patients (0.8%) each and respiratory rate decreased and anxiety in 2 patients (0.6%) each. See 
ISS Section 5.2.8.1 for additional discussion. 
Comparison with Zalviso 
Results  were  consistent  across  pooled  patient  populations,  as  the  moderate  and  severe  treatment-
related AEs in all pooled groups were generally consistent with those expected of opioid treatment and 
the treatment settings. A somewhat higher rate of discontinuations due to AEs was observed in studies 
of SST 15 µg as compared to studies of SST 30 µg (7.1% for SST 15 µg vs. 1.9% for SST 30 µg and 
2.7% for ARX-04 placebo vs. 5.8% for Zalviso placebo). This may be attributable to the longer study 
periods  of  the  studies  of  SST  15  µg  (up  to  72  hours  in  Phase  3  studies  and  12  hours  in  Phase  2 
studies)  as  compared  to  studies  of  SST  30  µg  (up  to  48  hours  in  SAP301,  12  hours  in  SAP303  and 
SAP202, and 5 hours in SAP302). In addition, a generally younger population received the SST 30 µg 
and  over  half  of  the  patients  treated  with  SST  15  µg  received  a  third  dose  in  the  first  hour  of 
treatment,  which  exceeds  the  dose of  sufentanil  received  from  the  maximum  SST  30  µg  dosage of  1

tablet  per  hour  (see  ISS  Section  10  for  additional  discussion,  including  comparison  of  AEs  between 
patients who received 2 or 3 doses of SST 15 µg). 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Sufentanil has been available in the EU since 1978, thus its safety profile, even in higher doses, is well 
established.  As  a  mainly  mu-agonist,  sufentanil  shares  with  morphine  and  fentanyl  mu-receptor-
mediated  adverse  drug  reactions  such  as  euphoria,  sedation,  respiratory  depression  and  decreased 
bowel motility, as well as causes nausea and vomiting by excitation of the chemosensitive trigger zone.  
In  2014,  AcelRx  presented  Zalviso,  a  15  μg  sufentanil  microtab  combined  with  a  PCA  dosing  system, 
which  allowed  patients  to  self-administer  15  μg  sufentanil  tablets  sublingually  after  major 
abdominal/orthopaedic  surgery.  In  Zalviso  Phase-3  clinical  studies,  there  were  numerous  patients, 
administering sufentanil doses very similar to that in the current application (i.e. 15 micrograms over 
20-25 minutes). After justification of similarity of cmax values for the two different dosage regimens, 
Applicant used safety data obtained from these patients to support the present application. 
Unlike Zalviso, the SST 30 μg was proposed to be administered only by HCPs in medically  monitored 
settings, rather than “hospital settings only” used for Zalviso. 
Baseline characteristics 
Clinical studies included 686 patients in total, out of whom 363 patients were exposed to SST 30 μg, 
and 323 patients were exposed to 30-45 μg/hour doses of Zalviso SST 15μg. 
Despite the proposed indication, majority of patients evaluated were post-operative, with an additional 
76 patients who were presented at ERs with acute pain significant enough to warrant opioid analgesia. 
The  pooled  database  for  the  safety  assessment  of  Sufentanil  30  μg  SST  includes  SST  15  μg  doses 
considered equivalent to SST 30 μg (2 SST 15 μg tablets dosed within 20 to 25 minutes of each other). 
However,  within  the  patients  who  received  SST  15  μg,  there  was  a  subset  (N  =  243  of  323)  who 
received  a  third  dose  of  the  SST  15  μg  in  the  first  hour  of  treatment,  which  exceeds  the  dose  of 
sufentanil received from the SST 30 μg product per hour. AEs were more common in patients receiving 
the SST 15 μg (80.8% of patients experienced AEs) than in patients receiving the SST 30 μg (44.6% of 
patients experienced AEs). Inclusion of the SST 15 μg patients in the overall study database provides a 
conservative  safety  assessment  since  these  patients  were  exposed  to  up  to  45  μg  of  sufentanil  in  1 
hour. 
Safety characteristics 
Based  on  clinical  study  results  and  data  from  the  published  literature,  including  available  safety 
information  on  the  epidural  route  of  Sufenta  administration  for  labor  analgesia,  the  conclusions  for 
safety have been drawn.  
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 73/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The AE profile of the SST 30 μg was typical of opioid agonists, and no new safety issues were identified 
in studies of the SST. In placebo-controlled studies, the most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, 
headache, dizziness, pruritus, and somnolence. 
The rate of SAEs was low, with 7 patients (5 SST and 2 placebo) out of 904 patients experiencing SAEs 
in pooled studies of the SST. SAEs included angina pectoris in a patient receiving SST 30 μg; oxygen 
saturation  decreased,  confusional  state,  hypoxia,  pulmonary  embolism,  atrial  fibrillation,  and 
postoperative ileus in patients receiving SST 15 μg; and syncope and hemiparesis in patients receiving 
placebo. 
There  were  few  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation.  Across  all  placebo-controlled  studies,  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were experienced by 3.6% of patients in the SST group and 3.4% in the placebo group 
– practically similarly. 
Across  studies  of  the  SST,  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  respiration  rate  were  generally  small  and 
not  clinically  meaningful.  In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  2  patients  (0.6%)  receiving  the  SST 
discontinued  due  to  respiratory  rate  decreased  and  1  each  (0.3%)  discontinued  following  oxygen 
saturation decreased and hypoventilation. 
1.1% of patients receiving the SST in placebo-controlled studies had a lowest oxygen saturation value 
<  90%.  Throughout  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  92.2%  of  patients  receiving  the  SST  maintained 
oxygen  saturation  values  >  93%,  and  80.2%  maintained  oxygen  saturation  values  >  95%  with  or 
without supplemental oxygen. 
Comparing the SST to placebo, the mean (SD) lowest oxygen saturation in the SST group was 95.0% 
(3.4%), which is somewhat lower than that observed in the placebo group (95.7% [1.6%]; p=0.001). 
No naloxone use was required throughout the ARX-04 studies. 
The published literature has been reviewed to inform the pregnancy and lactation labelling for the SST 
30  μg.  Sufentanil  has  been  shown  in  published  literature  to  cross  the  placenta,  and  cardiac  effects 
have been observed in neonates whose mothers received epidural or intrathecal sufentanil during labor 
and  delivery.  Sufentanil  has  been  reported  to  be  excreted  in  human  milk  following  epidural 
administration  but  had  no  apparent  effects  on  newborn  behaviour  over  3  days  postpartum  in  a 
published study.  
Subgroup analysis 
Safety  analysis  across  different  population  subgroups  (including  assessments  across  age  groups, 
sexes,  races  [Caucasian  vs.  non-Caucasian],  BMI  groups,  ASA  Classes,  patients  with  varying  organ 
function [hepatic and renal impairment], and surgery types) showed consistency with the known risks 
of opioids. Based on comparisons of AE rates, rates of AEs tended to be higher in older patient groups 
and  were  higher  in  women  than  in  men.  Rates  of  AEs  were  also  higher  in  patients  with  a  BMI  <  30 
kg/m2  than  in  patients  with  a  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2  and  ≤  40  kg/m2  and  in  ASA  Class  I  patients  than  in 
ASA Class II patients, although the clinical significance of this, if any, is unclear.   
Statistically significant differences in AE frequencies could be experienced for nausea and vomiting AEs 
between SST 30 μg and placebo groups for patients below 65 years of age, for both male and female 
patients,  for  Caucasian  patients,  for  patients  with  BMI  lower  than  30  kg/m2,  and  for  ASA  class  I 
patients. 
The analysis of subgroups, such as the older age-groups, were not meaningful due to limited number 
of patients.

Interaction with ketoconazole 
An interaction between sufentanil and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, was seen in a pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interaction study. Co-administration of SST 15 μg and oral ketoconazole 400 mg resulted in 
statistically  significantly  higher  AUC0-last  (60%  increase)  and  AUC0-inf  values  (77%  higher)  for 
sufentanil  in  plasma  compared  to  the  corresponding  values  for  SST  15  μg  administered  alone  (p  < 
0.001  for  each).  While  these  differences  are  statistically  significant,  given  the  as-needed  dosing 
schedule of the SST, they are unlikely to be clinically significant. Mean Cmax increased only by 19%, 
and  median  CST½  in  the  sufentanil  plus  ketoconazole  group  compared  to  sufentanil  alone  was  not 
statistically significantly different.

the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the immediate label (applicator label) as well as a request of 
translation exemption of the immediate label as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Dzuveo will be supplied as sublingual tablets in a single use applicator in a medically monitored setting. 
The size of the applicator is rather small and the printable space very limited. Being an opioid, the 
product is to be used by a HealthCare Professional only in a controlled medical setting. 
Apart from the space limitations, it was to be noted that the applicator will be included in a pouch 
which will display all required information, including route of administration, EXP and Lot. The 
applicator/tablet will have to be used immediately once removed from the pouch and this is reflected 
by the statement ‘Administer product immediately after opening pouch’ added on the pouch label.  
The particulars agreed to be printed in English only on the immediate label are: 
Dzuveo 30 mcg sublingual tablet 
sufentanil 
Lot 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language as agreed by the QRD Group. 
The applicant is also requested to include in the translated version of the package leaflet a reference to 
the name of the pharmaceutical form in English (in brackets), in section 6.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Sufentanil 30 µg sublingual tablet is indicated for the management of acute moderate to severe pain in 
adult patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Other available therapies include other opioids, in most cases given parenterally.  
The  rationale  for  delivering  sufentanil  sublingually  is  that  by  using  the  sublingual  space  as  a  drug 
depot,  the  drug  uptake  occurs  over  time,  resulting  in  a  sublingual  CST½  (median  =  2.3  hours)  that 
provides a more appropriate duration of analgesia compared to IV administration (median CST½  = 6 
minutes).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy  of  SST  30  μg  was  demonstrated  in  2  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies 
(SAP301 and SAP202) in a total of 221 patients (SST 30 μg, n = 147; placebo, n = 74) treated for up 
to  12  or  48  hours.  Further  support  for  the  clinical  utility  of  SST  30  μg  was  provided  by  2  open-label 
Phase 3 studies (SAP302 and SAP303) conducted in a total of 216 patients (76 patients presenting to 
the  Emergency  Department  and  140  post-surgical  patients).  Support  for  the  efficacy  of  SST  30  μg 
compared  to  an  active  comparator  is  provided  from  an  analysis  of  data  from  the  active-controlled 
Phase 3 study IAP309 conducted in support of the Zalviso product. 
SAP202  was  a  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial to  evaluate the  efficacy 
and safety of the Sufentanil Nanotab® for the management of acute pain following bunionectomy alone 
or  with  hammertoe  repair.  Patients  selected  were  18  to  80  years  old,  the  study  population  was 
representative  to  the  whole  human  population  in  terms  of  age  and  gender.  The  total  ITT  population 
number was 100 disposed in three treatment arms (placebo, 20µg sufentanil, 30µg sufentanil). 
SAP301  was  a  multicentre,  randomized  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the  efficacy 
and  safety  of  the  Sublingual  Sufentanil  Tablet  30  μg  in  adult  patients  who  had  undergone  an 
ambulatory abdominal surgery normally performed as an outpatient procedure: abdominoplasty; open-
tension-free inguinal hernioplasty (Lichtenstein repair with mesh); or laparoscopic abdominal surgery. 
A  total of  163 patients  (109  sufentanil,  54  placebo)  were  enrolled  and  randomized  in  this  study;  two 
patients  (both  in  the  sufentanil  group) did  not  receive  study  drug,  leaving 161  patients  who  received 
study drug and were included in the ITT and safety populations. The patients were 18 years or older, 
the  study  was  imbalanced  in  terms  of gender  and  white  population was overrepresented.  There  were 
approximately double number of women than men. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary benefit of SST 30 μg is its efficacy in management of moderate to severe acute pain. The 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  time-weighted  summary  of  pain  intensity  difference  in  the  first  12 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018  
Page 80/85 
 
 
 
 
 
hours (SPID12) after surgery. In both main studies 30µg sublingual sufentanil was superior to placebo. 
(In SAP202 LS Mean difference of SPID12: 13.66, 95% CI for difference 4.79, 22.52, p-value: 0.003; 
in SAP301 LS Mean difference: 12.70 (2.80), 95% CI for difference: 7.16, 18.23, p-value<0.001) 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of  clinical  relevance  were  total  pain  relief,  pain  intensity,  pain  intensity 
difference and use of rescue medication. These parameters supported the result in the primary efficacy 
endpoint. 
Data are consistent with those obtained from the clinical efficacy studies of Zalviso. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The connection between the plasma levels and the therapeutic effect was poorly defined. The SST 30 
μg  tablets  should  be  taken  on  an  on  demand  basis,  but  it  is  not  clear  which  extrinsic  and  intrinsic 
factors govern and influence the patients’ requests for additional doses. Pain intensity data were also 
imputed  after  rescue  medication  but  additional  analyses  showed  that  even  an  imputation  under  a 
worst-case scenario preserves the clinical and statistical significance of the results. 
SAP202  was  originally  designed  as  a  dose-finding  study  therefore  the  sample  size  was  too  small  to 
establish feasible subpopulation analyses. 
The sample size was small to see analgesic effect in patients over 65 years in both main studies. 
In SAP301 there were too few male patients to see superior analgesic effect to placebo in the subgroup 
analysis. 
The product was investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials against postoperative pain only. 
Other  acute  pain  situations  were  present  in  one  open-labelled  study  SAP302  without  active 
comparator. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Sufentanil has been available for clinical use since 1978 in the EU, thus its safety profile including the 
adverse  event  profile  and  the  abuse  potential  is  well  established  even  in  higher  doses  than  the  ones 
used for the current application (30 μg). 
Common sufentanil related adverse events were also seen in Sufentanil 30 µg SST clinical trials. Most 
frequent  of  treatment-related  adverse  events  in  the  SST  30  µg  group  (=sufentanil  related  adverse 
events)  were  nausea  (36.7%),  vomiting  (11.6%),  dizziness  (9.5%),  headache  (8.2%),  somnolence 
(6.8%),  hypotension  (3.4%),  pruritus  (2.7%),  in  the  SST  30μg  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies 
(ARX-04 Placebo-controlled safety data pool, Pool 3), and nausea (26.7%) and vomiting (5.8%) in All 
ARX-04 clinical studies (All ARX-04 safety data pool, Pool 2). 
Respiratory events, including decreased oxygen saturation, which is always a concern in opioid therapy 
was  experienced  in two  cases  in  Pool  3  clinical  studies.  However,  one of  them  was  a  respiratory  rate 
decreased AE, which was considered a severe one and led to discontinuation of the concerned patient 
from the study. 
These  effects  necessitate  the  restriction  of  use  of  the  Sufentanil  30µg  SST  to  a  medically  monitored 
setting, where these potentially life threatening events can be recognized and controlled adequately in 
a  timely  manner.  This  means  a  somewhat  narrower  use  than  the  proposed  one  (i.e.  a  medically 
supervised setting). 
Assessment report  
EMA/302958/2018

A  pooled  safety  analysis  was  also  carried  out  for  placebo-controlled  sufentanil  SST  30µg  studies 
together with placebo-controlled Zalviso studies (=safety data pool Pool 5). A subset of patients taking 
30-45  µg  sufentanil  (=2-3  Zalviso  15  µg  microtabs)  during  one  hour  from  placebo-controlled  Zalviso 
studies was included into Pool 5. Safety findings for Pool 5 was similar to tha observed in Pool 3 in AEs 
and AE frequencies. 
Comparison of safety profile of Sufentanil 30 µg SST with Zalviso Phase 2 and Phase 3 safety data pool 
(=Zalviso  comparison  Pool)  showed  a  more  favourable  safety  profile  for  Sufentanil  30  µg  SST  in  AE/ 
SAE rate and AE severity. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Co-medication data were presented in a rather general manner in the submitted Summary of  Clinical 
Safety and Integrated Safety Summary documents, explicit concomitant medication data were included 
into patients’ CRFs only.  
Analysis of effect of concomitant medication, including an eventual perioperative opioid medication (if 
any)  on  safety  findings  was  not  presented.  Incidence  of  patients  requiring  rescue  therapy  as  well  as 
rescue  medications  used  in  ARX-04  studies  were  different,  e.g.  proportion  of  patients  not  requiring 
rescue  medication  varied  from  30.0%  (SAP202)  to  85.7%  (SAP303,  total).  This  variability  further 
complicated the definition of the safety characteristics of Sufentanil 30 µg SST. 
AE rate was found lower for patients with BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m2 than for BMI <30 kg/m2 for 
ARX-04 (SST 30 µg) data pools (Pool 2 and Pool 3) as well as in SST 30 µg-Zalviso combined data pool 
(Pool  5)  and  Zalviso  data  pool.  This  is  an  interesting  phenomenon,  since  the  opposite  one  would  be 
expected  from  clinical  point  of  view.  AE  observations  for  BMI  subgroup  of  >40  kg/m2  should  be 
handled with caution because of the low patient number in this BMI subgroup. 
Safety data for patients ≥75 years of age also are limited, since there were only 8 of them in All ARX-
04  Patient  Pool  (Pool  2)  and  60 of  them  were included into  Combined  Placebo-controlled  patient  pool 
(Pool 5). 
In the Phase 3 trials, the therapeutic sufentanil levels were significantly below what is the potentially 
achievable  level  with  hourly  dosing.  Because  of  lower  than  maximally  achievable  plasma  levels  the 
safety data might underestimate the risk when the SST 30 μg tablets are administered as frequently as 
the SmPC allows.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Moderate to severe acute pain in post-operative patients occurs frequently and is often difficult to treat 
effectively  or  is  undertreated.  Despite  substantial  advances  in  the  knowledge  of  acute  pain 
mechanisms, post-operative pain is still under-managed. Strong opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, or 
oxycodone,  are  recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  as  part  of  the  analgesic  pain 
ladder  for  the  management  of  moderate to  severe pain  conditions  (WHO  1996),  at  least  as  part  of a 
multi-modular pain regimen. 
As  this  product  is  administered  in  a  non-invasive  way,  the  burden  with  injection/infusion  is  avoided 
which  might  make  pain  control  easier.    A  non-invasive  route  of  administration  may  be  especially 
relevant when the availability of IV access may be limited, such as by a patient’s physical location in an 
emergency  trauma  situation  or  by  difficulty  in  accessing  veins  in  patients  in  shock  due  to 
vasoconstriction or in obese, elderly, burn, and needle-phobic patients.  
Although subpopulation analyses were in some cases impossible (effect in elderly patient) or negative 
(male  patients  in  study  SAP301),  based  on  previous  results  from  Zalviso  efficacy  studies  and  on  the 
general patterns of well-known opioids it is unlikely that age or gender would have high impact on the 
effectiveness of sufentanil. 
The unfavourable effects are those typical to opioids therefore well-known and predictable. One typical 
unfavourable effect characteristic to this product can be the consequence of swallowing the sublingual 
tablet: this may result in incomplete absorption of the active substance therefore decreased or absent 
efficacy.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Sufentanil  is  a  well-known  opioid  which  showed  efficacy  in  postoperative  settings  after  visceral  and 
orthopaedic surgery when administered sublingually as SST NanoTab 30µg.  
The  effects  and  adverse  effects  are  predictable,  based  on  previous  experience  with  other  opioids  and 
with a similar product Zalviso.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  Dzuveo  30  mcg  sublingal  tablet  for  the  management  of  acute  moderate  to  severe 
pain in adult patients is positive. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Dzuveo is favourable in the following indication:

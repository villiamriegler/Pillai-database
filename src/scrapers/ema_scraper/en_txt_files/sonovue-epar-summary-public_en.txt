EPAR summary for the public 
SonoVue 
sulphur hexafluoride  
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for SonoVue. It explains how the 
Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. It is 
not intended to provide practical advice on how to use SonoVue. 
For practical information about using SonoVue, patients should read the package leaflet or contact 
their doctor or pharmacist. 
What is SonoVue and what is it used for? 
SonoVue is a medicine for diagnostic use only. It is a contrast agent (it helps make internal body 
structures visible during imaging tests). SonoVue is used in tests that measure how ultrasound travels 
within the body because it improves the ability to create an echo. It is only used when the results of 
the test without a contrast agent are inconclusive. SonoVue is used in: 
• 
echocardiography (a diagnostic test where an image of the heart is obtained). It is used to obtain a 
clearer scan of the chambers of the heart, especially of the left ventricle, in adults with suspected 
or confirmed coronary artery disease; 
•  Doppler (a diagnostic test that measures the speed of blood flow). SonoVue can be used in adults 
for Doppler tests for large blood vessels, such as those in the head, those leading to the head or 
the main vein to the liver, or for smaller blood vessels such as those in lesions (areas of disease) in 
the breast or liver; 
•  ultrasound scans of the bladder and urinary tract in children and adolescents to detect 
vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys, 
leading to scarring and kidney infections. 
The medicine contains the active substance sulphur hexafluoride (a gas).

How is SonoVue used? 
SonoVue can only be obtained with a prescription and should only be used by doctors who have 
experience in diagnostic ultrasound imaging. It is available as a kit including one vial of gas and 
powder and one pre-filled syringe containing 5 ml of solvent. When made up into a solution, SonoVue 
contains sulphur hexafluoride gas as ‘microbubbles’ in suspension in a liquid. 
When used with ultrasound of the heart or for measuring blood flow, SonoVue is injected intravenously 
(into a vein) before the test is carried out, as a 2 or 2.4 ml dose depending on which test is being 
carried out. The dose can be repeated. When used to detect vesicoureteral reflux in children, 1 ml of 
SonoVue is given by a catheter into the bladder, which is then filled with saline (salt) solution until the 
patient feels the need to empty their bladder. The ultrasound scan of the bladder and kidneys is 
carried out during filling and emptying of the bladder. 
How does SonoVue work? 
The active substance in SonoVue, sulphur hexafluoride, is a gas that is not soluble in body fluids or 
water. When SonoVue is made up into a suspension, the gas is trapped in tiny bubbles called 
microbubbles. After injection, the microbubbles travel in the blood or disperse throughout the bladder, 
where they reflect ultrasound waves more than the surrounding tissues. This helps to enhance the 
results of tests that rely on measuring ultrasound. The gas is removed naturally from the blood 
through the lungs or passed out in the urine after bladder scans. 
What benefits of SonoVue have been shown in studies? 
For use in echocardiography, SonoVue was investigated in 3 main studies. These involved a total of 
317 patients, and compared SonoVue with another contrast agent and placebo (a dummy treatment). 
SonoVue was more effective than the comparator and than placebo in improving the clarity of the 
image obtained of the left ventricle and left ventricle border. 
For use in Doppler scans, a further 3 main studies involved 361 patients who were being tested for 
abnormalities in large blood vessels, and 217 patients being tested for abnormalities in smaller vessels. 
In these studies, SonoVue was not compared with any other medicine, but the results of the test with 
SonoVue were compared with the ‘gold standard’, such as angiography (X-rays of blood vessels). The 
main measure of effectiveness was how clear the images obtained in the test were. Using SonoVue to 
measure blood flow in large blood vessels improved the quality of the scan when testing the cerebral 
arteries (in the head), the carotids (in the neck) and the portal vein (leading to the liver), but not the 
renal arteries (leading to the kidneys). For the smaller vessels, SonoVue led to better quality scans 
when looking at the blood flow in breast and liver lesions. However, this was not observed  in the 
pancreas, kidney, ovary or prostate gland. 
The company also presented results from the literature of 4 main studies involving over 500 children 
given SonoVue before ultrasound scans of the bladder to detect vesicoureteral reflux. Ultrasound with 
SonoVue was compared with the standard method using X-rays with an X-ray contrast agent. Pooled 
analysis of the studies suggested that SonoVue identified children with vesicoureteral reflux in 89% of 
cases, and correctly distinguished patients who did not have the condition in 81% of cases. However, 
the results were not sufficient to state that a negative result following ultrasound with Sonovue allows 
the practitioner to exclude a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux.

What are the risks associated with SonoVue? 
The most common side effects when SonoVue is injected into a vein (seen in up to 1 in 100 patients) 
are headache, nausea (feeling sick) and reactions at the injection site. No side effects attributable to 
the medicine have been reported in children given SonoVue into the bladder. For the full list of all side 
effects reported with SonoVue, see the package leaflet. 
SonoVue must not be injected into a vein in patients known to have right-to-left shunts (abnormal 
movement of blood within the heart), severe pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the 
pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that leads from the heart to the lungs), uncontrolled hypertension 
(high blood pressure) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (severe fluid build-up in both lungs). 
SonoVue must also not be used together with the medicine dobutamine (used for heart failure) in 
patients for whom dobutamine is not suitable. For the full list of restrictions, see the package leaflet. 
Why is SonoVue approved? 
SonoVue has been shown to be effective in improving ultrasound scans of the heart in adults and the 
bladder in children, and in measurements of blood flow. Side-effects were generally minor. The 
European Medicines Agency therefore decided that SonoVue’s benefits are greater than its risks and 
recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
SonoVue? 
The company will carry out a study to confirm the effectiveness of SonoVue in detecting vesicoureteral 
reflux in children and its impact on the way patients are managed. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of SonoVue have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet.

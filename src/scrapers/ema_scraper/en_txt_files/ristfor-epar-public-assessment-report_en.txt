1.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1.1 
Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. submitted on 2 October 2009 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency for Ristfor, through the centralised procedure under 
Article  3  (2)  (a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  was 
agreed upon by the CHMP on 27 July 2009.  
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  10(c)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  – 
relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. for an 
authorised medicinal product Janumet (EU/1/08/455/001-016). The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme 
Ltd.  previously  obtained  a  Marketing  Authorization 
for  multiple  applications  Velmetia 
(EU/1/08/456/001-016) and Efficib (EU/1/08/457/001-016) on 16 July 2008. 
The application submitted is a dossier composed of administrative information, quality, non-clinical 
and clinical data with a letter from a MAH Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. allowing the cross reference to 
relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Ristfor  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  patients 
inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being 
treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
Ristfor  is  indicated  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  (i.e.,  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Ristfor is indicated as triple combination therapy with a PPARγ agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a PPARγ agonist.  
Ristfor is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dosage of insulin and metformin alone 
do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
The  Agency  refused  the  proposed  PIP  for  Janumet  and  granted  a  waiver  for  all  subsets  of  the 
paediatric population on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not present a significant 
therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients (EMEA-000165-PIP01-07). 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
Licensing status: 
The initial product, Janumet, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 16 July 2008.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
3.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
The MAH for Janumet provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical 
documentation contained in the file of Janumet, assessed and approved.  
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Ristfor are identical to the up to date quality, safety 
and efficacy profile of Janumet. The application for Ristfor concerns the strengths of 50 mg/850 mg 
and 50 mg/1000 mg of film-coated tablets with pack sizes identical to those approved for Janumet and 
consists only of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Ristfor medicinal product are identical to the up-to-
date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Janumet.  
Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Janumet CHMP assessment reports and 
in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The  Ristfor  informed  consent  application  concerns  only  the  50  mg/850  mg  and  50  mg/1000  mg, 
strengths of Janumet. The Summary of Product Characteristics for Ristfor appropriately reflects this.  
The approved indication is:  
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Ristfor  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  patients 
inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being 
treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
Ristfor  is  indicated  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  (i.e.,  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Ristfor is indicated as triple combination therapy with a PPARγ agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a PPARγ agonist.

Ristfor is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dosage of insulin and metformin alone 
do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
The  active  substances  of  Ristfor  (A10BD07),  a  combination  product  of  oral  blood  glucose-lowering 
drugs,  are  sitagliptin  and  metformin  hydrochloride.  Sitagliptin  is  a  dipeptidyl  peptidase-4  (DPP-4) 
inhibitor.  DPP-4  inhibition  reduces  the  cleavage  and  inactivation  of  the  active  (intact)  form  of  the 
incretin  hormones,  including  GLP-1  (glucagon-like  peptide  1)  and  GIP  (glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic  polypeptide).  This  way  active  incretin  concentrations  are  elevated  and  that  leads  to 
enhancement  of  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion  and  a  reduction  in  glucagon  release,  thus 
contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  glucose  homeostasis.  Metformin  is  a  biguanide  and  has  an 
antihyperglycaemic effect, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. It is 
thought  to  act  via  various  mechanisms,  including  decreasing  hepatic  glucose  production,  decreasing 
intestinal  absorption  of  glucose,  and  improving  insulin  sensitivity  by  increasing  peripheral  glucose 
uptake  and  utilisation.  Ristfor  combines  these  two  antidiabetic  agents  with  complementary 
mechanisms of action. 
The benefits with Ristfor are its clinically relevant and significant reduction of blood glucose levels in 
patients  inadequately  controlled  by  metformin  alone,  although  non-inferior  efficacy  versus  the 
addition  of  glipizide  was  not  proven,  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  of  glycaemic  control  when 
added to a SU agent, and a presumed improvement of compliance by use of two antidiabetic agents in 
one tablet to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The effect on body weight is 
similar to that of metformin alone. The most common side effect when taking Ristfor is nausea. When 
sitagliptin  is  taken  as  monotherapy  side  effects  in  excess  (0.2%  of  patients  and  >1  patient)  of  that  in 
patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness. Furthermore, the 
following adverse reactions for the metformin component are known: gastrointestinal symptoms such 
as  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  loss  of  appetite,  and  metallic  taste.  When  Ristfor  is 
taken in combination with a sulphonylurea, common side effects are low blood sugar and constipation. 
When  taking  Ristfor  with  PPARγ  agonists  the  most  common  side  effects  are  headache,  diarrhoea, 
vomiting, low blood sugar and foot swelling. When taking Ristfor with insulin the most common side 
effect is low blood sugar. 
3.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Janumet application, the quality data in support of 
the Ristfor application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Janumet dossier , which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).  
3.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Since  Ristfor  application  is  an  informed  consent  of the  Janumet  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in 
support  of  the  Janumet  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Janumet 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
3.4  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Janumet application, the clinical data in support of 
the Ristfor application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Janumet dossier, which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). No additional clinical studies 
are provided. 
3.5 Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
Page 5 of 6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (version 6) described by the applicant 
fulfils the legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan (version 2.0) identical with that for Janumet. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
PSURs 
As requested by the MAH and agreed by the CHMP, the PSUR cycle of informed consent application 
will correspond to the one attributed to the product, Janumet, unless otherwise specified. 
3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Janumet application, the CHMP considered that 
the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Ristfor  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation by consensus for the following indication:  
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Ristfor  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  patients 
inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being 
treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
Ristfor  is  indicated  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  (i.e.,  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Ristfor is indicated as triple combination therapy with a PPARγ agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
metformin and a PPARγ agonist.  
Ristfor is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dosage of insulin and metformin alone 
do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
•  User consultation 
A justification for not conducting a user testing for this application was provided. In view of the fact 
that a readability test had been performed at the time of the original MAA for Janumet and the content 
of  the  package  leaflet  is  identical  to  the  latest  approved  leaflet  of  Janumet,  no  further  testing  is 
warranted.

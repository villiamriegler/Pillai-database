2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an illness characterised by air flow limitation that is 
not fully reversible. It is usually progressive and is associated with pathological changes in the lung - a 
combination,  varying  between  individual  patients,  of  obstructive  bronchiolitis  and  parenchymal 
destruction  (emphysema).  The  principal  environmental  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  COPD  is 
exposure  to  tobacco  smoke,  but  occupational  or  other  exposure  to  some  chemicals  and  both  organic 
and inorganic dusts are also known to increase the risk. The most widely accepted classification of the 
severity  of  COPD  is  according  to  The  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD). 
The  GOLD  classification  is  based  on  the  degree  of  impairment  of  lung  function.  Four  categories  are 
recognised: mild, moderate, severe, very severe (Stages I-IV).  
The  prevalence  of  COPD  in  the  population  is  difficult  to  estimate,  but  it  is  a  major  public  health 
problem  and  currently  the  fourth  leading  cause  of  chronic  morbidity  and  mortality.    Mortality  due  to 
COPD  is  again  difficult  to  estimate,  but  it  appears  to  be  increasing.  Between  1970  and  2002,  deaths 
due to COPD doubled, in contrast to a decrease in deaths due to some other chronic diseases such as 
cardiovascular  disease  (Jemal  et  al  2005).  This  is  probably  due  to  two  factors,  namely  the  aging 
population, and the fact that COPD mortality lags trends in tobacco smoking by several decades. It is 
estimated that by 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of global mortality (GOLD 2009). 
The  aims  of  pharmacological  treatment  in  COPD,  as  described  in  the  GOLD  guideline  are  to  prevent 
and  control  symptoms,  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations,  to  improve  health 
status, and to improve exercise tolerance. GOLD guidelines recognize that bronchodilators (by reducing 
airflow limitation) are central to the management of symptoms in COPD and recommend regular use of 
long-acting bronchodilators for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Within the class of long-acting 
bronchodilators, long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) and long-acting antimuscarinic (LAMAs) are available. 
There are several marketed LABAs such as formoterol, salmeterol, and indacaterol and for the group of 
LAMAs tiotropium, glycopyrronium bromide and aclidinium bromide are currently available. LABAs and 
LAMAs  as  single-agent  are  recommended  first-line  treatments  in  moderate  to  severe  COPD. 
Combination  treatment  with  LABA  and  LAMA  is  recommended  as  option  by  the  2013  version  of  the 
GOLD  COPD  guidelines  when  symptoms  are  not  improved  with  single  agent  in  patients  classified  as 
group B (low risk, more symptoms). Similarly, the combination of a LABA and a LAMA in addition to an 
inhaled corticosteroid is recommended as alternative to a single-agent LABA or LAMA plus an inhaled 
corticosteroid in patients classified as group C (high risk, less symptoms). The GOLD 2013 states that 
“Both long-acting anticholinergic and long-acting beta 2 agonists reduce the risk of exacerbations, and 
although  good  long-term  studies  are  lacking,  the  principle  of  combination  treatment  seems  sound” 
(GOLD 2013). 
About the product 
Xoterna  Breezhaler  (also  referred  to  as  QVA149)  is  a  novel  fixed-dose  combination  of  indacaterol 
maleate  (QAB149)  and  glycopyrronium  bromide  (NVA237)  intended  as  a  once-daily  maintenance 
bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  and  reduce  exacerbations  in  patients  with  COPD.  It  is 
being developed as a dry powder inhalation formulation. 
QAB149  (indacaterol  maleate)  is  a  long-acting  beta2-adrenergic  agonist  (LABA).  When  inhaled, 
indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 9/99 
 
  
NVA237  (glycopyrronium  bromide)  is  a  long  acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (LAMA). 
Glycopyrronium  works  by  blocking  the  bronchoconstrictor  action  of  acetylcholine  on  airway  smooth 
muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways. 
The  fixed  combination  QVA149  at  the  dose  of  85/43  microgram  is  intended  for  a  once-daily 
maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms and reduce exacerbations in adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). QVA149 is to be administered once daily (o.d.) as 
a capsule via a low resistance single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) also referred to as Concept1 or 
Breezhaler.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  white  to  almost  white  inhalation  powder  in  size  3  hard 
hypromellose  capsule,  with  transparent  yellow  cap  and  transparent  natural  body,  with  black  Novartis 
logo on cap and blue ‘IGP110.50’ under two blue bars on body. In addition to the active substance, the 
capsules contain lactose and magnesium stearate as excipients. 
The  capsules  contain  fixed  combination  of  143  µg  of  indacaterol  maleate  (corresponding  110  µg  of 
indacaterol)  and  63  µg  of  glycopyrronium  bromide  (corresponding  to  50  µg  of  glycopyrronium)  as 
active  substances.  The  delivered  dose  (the  dose  that  leaves  the  mouthpiece  of  the  inhaler)  contains 
110 μg of indacaterol maleate equivalent to 85 μg of indacaterol and 54 μg of glycopyrronium bromide 
equivalent to 43 μg of glycopyrronium.  
The product is available in PA/Alu/PVC – Alu perforated unit-dose blisters as described in section 6.5 of 
the  SmPC,  in  various  pack  sizes.  Each  package  of  the  product  contains  a  single-dose  dry  powder 
inhaler (Xoterna Breezhaler inhaler).  
2.2.2.  Active Substance Indacaterol Maleate 
Indacaterol maleate is white to very slightly greyish or very slightly yellowish powder. It is very slightly 
soluble  in  water,  5%  glucose,  pH  3  citrate  buffer  and  isopropanol.  Slight  solubility  is  observed  in 
methanol,  ethanol  and  propylene  glycol.  Indacaterol  maleate  is  freely  soluble  in  N-methylpyrrolidone 
and dimethylformamide. It is not hygroscopic.  
The chemical name is (IUPAC) (R)-5-[2-(5,6-Diethylindan-2-ylamino)-1-hydroxyethyl]-8-hydroxy-1H-
quinolin-2-one maleate and has the following structural formula: 
Indacaterol maleate has one chiral carbon; the active substance is pure R form. It displays keto/enol 
tautomerism at the quinolinone ring.  Indacaterol maleate exists in one polymorphic form A, which was 
confirmed by TGA, DSC and XRD.

The molecular structure of indacaterol maleate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV, IR, 1H-
NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and X-Ray crystallography.  
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured in four main steps, followed by crystallisation, micronisation and 
de-agglomeration. Chiral purity of the active substance is secured. Commercially available, well defined 
starting  materials  are  used  for  the  active  substance  synthesis.  In-process  controls  are  in  place  at  all 
critical  steps  of  the  synthetic  process.  Specifications  and  control  methods  for  starting  materials, 
reagents and intermediate products have been presented. 
The manufacturing process has been modified several times during the development 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, clarity and colour of solution,  identity 
(IR,  X-ray  diffraction),  assay  (titration,  HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  enantiomer  (HPLC),  maleate 
(titration),  amorphous  content  (microcalorimetry),  loss  on  drying  (thermogravimetry),  residual 
solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals  (Ph.Eur.),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.Eur.),  microbial  purity  (Ph.Eur.),  bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph.Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction).  
Each  specification  parameter  was  sufficiently  justified.  Acceptance  criteria  for  non-compendial  tests 
have been set in accordance with batch results and CHMP/ICH guidelines.  
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  for  19  batches  produced  with  the  proposed  synthetic  route  E, 
manufactured using production equipment. The batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can 
be  manufactured  reproducibly.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and  consistent  from  batch  to 
batch. 
Sufficient  information  is  provided  on  potential  impurities  and  residual  solvents.  Levels  of  impurities 
found  in  the  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  toxicologically  justified  and  well  below  specification 
limits. 
Analytical procedures have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
Stability 
Five  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  packed  in  double  LDPE  bags  were  put  on 
stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term conditions (25°C/60%RH) for up to 60 months, 
intermediate  conditions  (30°C/65%RH)  for  12  months,  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  6  months. 
Stability results at 5°C (24 months for each batch) are also available.  
Photostability  testing  and  forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  during  the  development.  The 
results provide good information on degradation patterns of the active substance. The active substance 
is not sensitive to light.  
The parameters tested during stability studies were the same as for release.  
The stability results presented are well within specification and support the proposed retest period.

2.2.3.  Active Substance Glycopyrronium Bromide  
Glycopyrronium  bromide  is  a  white  powder.  It  is  freely  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in  ethanol  96%  and 
very  slightly  soluble  in  methylene  chloride.  Glycopyrronium  bromide  is  a  quaternary  ammonium  salt 
(ionic compound) and is completely ionized between pH 1 and 14. It is not hygroscopic.  
The chemical name is: 
3-(2-Cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetoxy)-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium bromide. Glycopyrronium 
bromide is a racemic mixture of the 3R, 2S and 3S, 2R stereoisomers.  
The structural formula is as follows: 
  [2S, 3R] Stereoisomer  
[2R, 3S] Stereoisomer  
No optical rotation is seen in solution. Glycopyrronium bromide consists of a single polymorphic form, 
crystalline Form A. The molecular structure has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 
13C-NMR, MS and X-Ray crystallography.  
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  in  two  main  steps,  followed  by  crystallisation  and  several  re-
crystallisation steps. 
Well defined starting materials are used for the active substance synthesis. In-process controls are in 
place  at  all  critical  steps  of  the  synthetic  process  and  are  considered  adequate.  Specifications  and 
control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented  and 
found satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process has been modified several times during the development. 
Specification 
The active substance is controlled according to Ph.Eur. monograph for glycopyrronium bromide and in 
line  with  EU/ICH  guidelines.  Additional  tests  are  included  for  identity  by  X-ray  diffraction,  residual 
solvents  by  GC,  heavy  metals  by  DCP/ICP-OES,  assay  by  HPLC,  assay  of  bromide  by  titration  and 
microbial tests according to Ph.Eur. All additional methods were appropriately validated. 
The methods used to control for Ph.Eur. enantiomeric purityand the method for related substances are 
not  performed  according  to  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  but  with  in-house  methods  equivalent  to  the 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report

Ph.Eur.  methods.  The  method  or  loss  on  drying  is  a  thermogravimetric  method  and  not  the  same 
method as prescribed by Ph.Eur; however, this is acceptable as the method was fully validated. 
Justifications  have  been  presented  for  each  of  the  requirements  and  limits  listed  in  the  active 
substance  specification.  .  The  absence  of  particle  size  test  has  been  discussed;  it  is  not  considered a 
relevant  parameter  for  the  release  of  the  active  substance  as  it  is  addressed  during  the  finished 
product manufacture.  
Batch  analysis  results  are  presented  for  25  batches,  ten  of  which  have  been  manufactured  by  the 
current  synthetic  route.  All  batches  comply  with  the  proposed  specifications.  The  test  results indicate 
that the active substance is of high purity and that the process is under control.  
Stability 
Six  pilot  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  have  been  stored  under  ICH  conditions  for  up  to  36 
months  (long-term,  25ºC/60%  RH)  and  6  months  (accelerated,  40ºC/75%  RH),  respectively.  The 
samples  were  stored  in  the  commercial  packaging,  i.e.  double  low  density  polyethylene  bags  and 
metallic drums. Photostability studies and stress studies were also performed, in addition to storage in 
a refrigerator and in a freezer.  
The following parameters were tested during stability: appearance, identity , X-ray diffraction, related 
substances,  enantiomeric  purity,  loss  on  drying,  clarity  of  the  solution,  colour  of  the  solution,  assay  
and microbial enumeration tests. Release testing methods are used.  
No changes in the test results are observed in long-term studies, accelerated studies and photostability 
tests.  The  results  of  the  forced  degradation  studies  show  that  the  active  substance  is  subject  to 
hydrolysis and oxidation. The methods used were proved to be stability indicating.  
The stability results presented are well within specification and support the proposed retest period and 
storage conditions.  
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The formulation development has been adequately described. The aim of the pharmaceutical 
development was to obtain an inhalation powder that would deliver the required fixed dose of two 
active substances when used with a single-dose dry powder inhaler. 
The  finished  product  is  a  white  to  almost  white  inhalation  powder  in  hard  hypromellose  capsules, 
administered via a single-dose dry powder inhaler for oral inhalation. The capsules are pierced in the 
device before inhalation.  
Lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate are used as excipients. Both are of compendial quality, 
with  a  number  of  additional  tests  relevant  for  an  inhalation  formulation.  Components  of  the 
hypromellose  capsules  and  the  printing  inks  (black  and  blue)  have  been  provided  together  with  their 
compendial status. Tartrazine (E102) is used as colorant for the capsule. The printing inks used on the 
outside of the capsule are not in direct contact with the inhalation powder.

The  fine  active  substance  particles  of  both  active  substances  are  homogeneously  attached  to  the 
surface  of  coarse  particles  of  an  inert  carrier,  lactose.  During  inhalation,  the  dry  powder  dose  is 
entrained into the turbulent airflow generated in the inhaler mouthpiece, leading to the detachment of 
the active substances particles from the surface of the coarse carrier particles. Once released from the 
carrier, the particles are inhaled and deposited into the lungs. 
Lactose  monohydrate is  a  primary  component  of the  inhalation  powder  and  is  a  carrier  for the  active 
substances.  The  crystalline  nature  and  particle  size  distribution  is  controlled  to  achieve  reproducible 
dose delivery performance.  
The  finished  product  has  been  developed  based  on  the  Seebri  Breezhaler  product,  glycopyrronium 
bromide,  inhalation  powder  hard  capsules  (authorised  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  September 
2012).  Indacaterol  maleate,  authorised  in  Onbrez  Breezhaler  (via  centralised  procedure  in  November 
2011),  has  been  added  to  the  formulation  and  corresponding  adjustment  of  the  levels  of  excipients 
have  been  made.  However,  during  development  a  higher  fine  particle  mass  (FPM)  and  fine  particle 
fraction  (FPF)  of  indacaterol  maleate  as  determined  by  aerodynamic  particle  size  distribution  (APSD) 
measurement  for  particles  ≤  5  μm  via  next  generation  impactor  (NGI),  were  observed  with  the  new 
combination formulation. The results indicate the need for dose adjustment.  
Several  pharmacokinetics  studies  were  conducted,  where  different  strengths  of  the  combination 
products  were  compared  with  the  approved  products  Onbrez  and  Seebri.  Based  on  in-vitro 
performance  characteristics  the  predicted  lung  exposure  and  total  exposure  were  estimated  and 
compared with the observed systemic exposure.   
A dose adjustment was performed for indacaterol, based on the measurements, from 120 μg contained 
in  Onbrez  to  85  μg  (delivered  dose).  To  support  this  adjustment  a  comparison  of  the  APSD  obtained 
with  25  commercial  scale  batches  of  Onbrez  Breezhaler  and  40  commercial  scale  batches  of  Xoterna 
Breezhaler is presented. The in-vitro performance of the approved Seebri Breezhaler product and the 
Xoterna Breezhaler is comparable and no dose adjustment is proposed for glycopyrronium bromide. 
The inhaler is a Class I medical device and its conformity with directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical 
devices has been certified by Novartis Pharma AG in a ‘declaration of conformity’. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate, used as an excipient, is the only material of animal origin which is used in the 
product.  Appropriate  declaration  confirming  compliance  with  the  TSE  guideline  has  been  provided  by 
the  lactose  manufacturer.  Lactose  is  produced  from  milk  obtained  from  healthy  animals  under  the 
same conditions as milk intended for human consumption. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable and synthetic origin.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 13 steps; in the first four steps the pharmaceutical intermediate 
is  formed,  followed  by  blending,  sieving  and  adding  the  remaining  components.  The  mixture  is  then 
filled into hard capsules and packed in blisters.   
During  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product,  the  active  substance  glycopyrronium 
bromide  is  transformed  into  a  pharmaceutical  intermediate  (PI).  This  pharmaceutical  intermediate  is 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 14/99 
 
 
 
  
tested for appearance, identity, particle size, water, heavy metals, degradation products and microbial 
purity. Holding time of the intermediate is supported by a stability study.  
Micronised indacaterol maleate, lactose monohydrate and additional magnesium stearate are added in 
the  next  step  to  obtain  the  final dry  powder  blend. The  powder  blend  is  filled  into  hard  hypromellose 
capsules.  The  filled  capsules  are  subject  to  an  equilibration  step  before  packaging  into  PA/Alu/PVC  – 
Alu blisters.  
Critical steps have been identified in the finished product manufacture. The quality of the intermediate 
and  the  finished  product  is  controlled  by  the  manufacturing  settings  of  process  parameters.  No 
additional in-process testing is required.  
The manufacturing process validation was conducted on three commercial scale batches, both for the 
pharmaceutical  intermediate  and  the  finished  product.  Validation  data  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a 
reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. The 
product  is  tested  for  description  (shell  and  content),  identification  (TLC,  HPLC),  fine  particle  mass  by 
next  generation  impactor  (Ph.Eur.,  apparatus  E),  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (HPLC),  degradation 
products  (HPLC),  loss  on  drying  (in-house  method,  halogen  dryer),  microbial  enumeration  tests 
(Ph.Eur.) and assay (HPLC).   
The  acceptance  criteria  for  all  specification  parameters  are  justified by  batch results  and  comply  with 
relevant  CHMP/ICH  guidelines.  The  degradation  products  derived  from  both  active  substances  are 
discussed and specified in the finished product as appropriate. 
All test methods for the finished product control are sufficiently described and appropriately validated.  
Batch  analysis  results  were  provided  for  11  batches  of  production  scale.  All  results  comply  with 
specifications.  
Stability of the product 
18 months of long-term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate (30°C/75% RH) stability data and 6  months 
accelerated data (40°C/75% RH) are presented for 3 commercial scale batches. 
Additional  stability  studies  for  the  product  stored  in  a  freezer  (-20°C)  and  a  refrigerator  (5°C)  for 
6 months  have  been  performed.  Photostability  has  also  been  evaluated  according  to  ICH  Q1B 
guideline.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested  during  stability:  appearance  of  capsule  content,  appearance  of 
shell,  fine  particle  mass  by  next  generation  impactor  (NGI),  loss  on  drying,  average  delivered  dose, 
uniformity  of  delivered  dose,  assay  by  HPLC  (both  active  substances),  enantiomer  of  indacaterol 
maleate,  degradation  products  by  HPLC  and  microbial  enumeration  tests.  Aerodynamic  particle  size 
distribution by NGI is tested and detailed results (fraction on each stage) are presented. 
No  changes  were  seen  regarding  appearance  of  capsule  or  its  content.  The  assay  for  both  active 
substances  decreases  under  long-term  condition  and  the  decrease  is  even  more  pronounced  under 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013

accelerated  conditions  but  the  results  remain  inside  the  specification  limits.  The  results  from  the 
photostability study did not indicate sensitivity to light as the chemical and physical properties remain 
stable after exposure to light according to ICH Q1B requirements. The product is sensitive to moisture, 
which affects fine particle mass.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.   
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
QVA149  is  a  novel  fixed-dose  combination  of  a  LABA  (indacaterol  maleate,  QAB149)  and  a  LAMA 
(glycopyrronium bromide, NVA237) intended as a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment to 
relieve  symptoms  and  reduce  exacerbations  in  patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD).  The  individual  monotherapy  components,  indacaterol  maleate  and  glycopyrronium  bromide 
have also been developed for the treatment of COPD.  
The  pharmacology  profile  of  QVA149  is  driven  by  the  pharmacology  of  its  two  bronchodilatory 
components.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  each  component  is  well  described in  the  literature  and  also 
summarised  in  the  Applicant’s  dossier.  The  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  assessments  of  the  long-
acting  β2-adrenergic  agonist  indacaterol  were  performed  in  a  mechanistic  guinea  pig  model,  as  rats 
and  mice  are  poorly  responsive  to  β2-adrenergic  agonists.  In  contrast,  the  most  appropriate  species, 
based on functional airway responses to cholinergic agonists, to profile the LAMA glycopyrronium was 
deemed to be  the  rat.  As a  consequence,  whilst  it  is  feasible to  evaluate the  effects  of  the  individual 
components on bronchodilation in vivo, there are no relevant single species in vivo mechanistic models 
where  it  is  possible  to  test  the  combination  of  an  inhaled  β2  adrenergic  agonist  and  muscarinic 
antagonist.  Therefore,  the  efficacy  of  QVA149  was  profiled  in  an  ex  vivo  mechanistic  model,  under 
non-GLP  conditions  using  isolated  guinea  pig  trachea  and  employing  carbachol  as  the  contractile 
stimulus.  
Pharmacokinetics  and  bioavailability  studies  were  performed  with  the  individual  components  of 
QVA149, namely indacaterol and glycopyrronium, in toxicity test species and human. The program was 
supplemented  by  sampling  during  QVA149  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  to  confirm  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  under  conditions  of  safety  evaluation.  Most 
toxicity/toxicokinetics  studies  were  performed  with  nose-only  (rats)  or  face  mask  (dogs)  inhalation 
using  the  intended  clinical  powder  formulation.  For  the  individual  components  of  QVA149,  tissue

distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  studies  (ADME)  in  animals  were  conducted  using  radiolabeled 
drug  substance  with  oral  (p.o),  intravenous  (i.v)  or  intratracheal  (i.t.)  administration.  To  investigate 
the  contribution  of  different  absorption  pathways  following  inhalation  (i.e.,  lung  vs  gastrointestinal 
absorption  after  swallowing  of  an  unknown  drug  substance  portion),  a  series  of  supplementary  oral 
studies  (complete  swallowing),  intratracheal  studies  (no  swallowing)  and  inhalation  studies  (partial 
swallowing)  were  conducted.  Studies  utilised  non-radiolabeled  or  radiolabeled  QVA149  components 
and  were  run  with  and  without  concomitant  oral  administration  of  activated  charcoal.  In  vitro 
blood/plasma  distribution,  protein  binding  and  metabolism  studies  were  performed  to  support  the  in 
vivo studies, to characterize the enzymes involved in metabolism and the active transport mechanisms 
of indacaterol or glycopyrronium and to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions. While they 
were  not  required  to  be  conducted  under  GLP  conditions,  the  studies  were  carried  out  according  to 
available  standard  operating  procedures  and/or  current  scientific  standards  as  described  in  the  study 
plans. 
The  non-clinical  safety  evaluation  of  QVA149  is  based  upon  the  complete  toxicology  programs 
conducted for both individual monotherapy components that included chronic toxicity, reproductive and 
development  toxicity,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  A  bridging  toxicology  program  was 
performed  for  QVA149  that  included  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  assessments,  2-week 
inhalation  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  a  13-  week  inhalation  toxicity  study  in  dogs  and  an 
inhalation embryo-fetal development study in rats. This program is considered by the Applicant to be 
in  compliance  with  (CHMP/SWP/258498/05)  Guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed 
Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products  (January  2008)  and  (ICH  M3)  Guidance  on  Nonclinical  Safety 
Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (June 
2009). Indacaterol and glycopyrronium were administered in the QVA149 inhalation toxicity studies as 
a  mixture  at  a  drug  ratio  in  terms  of  the  active  ingredients  of  3:1  (indacaterol/glycopyrronium)  to 
reflect  the  expected  clinical  dose  ratios  of  the  two  monotherapy  components  i.e.,  150  μg/day 
indacaterol and 50 μg/day glycopyrronium. During the development program of QVA149, an increase 
in  the  fine  particle  mass  (FPM)  of  indacaterol  was  observed  in  the  combination  product.  In  order  to 
obtain a FPM of indacaterol in QVA149 that matches the FPM of the monotherapy product, the dose of 
indacaterol  in  QVA149  was  adjusted  from  150  μg  to  110  μg.  After  the  dose  adjustment,  the  FPM  of 
indacaterol  was  comparable  between  the  indacaterol  monotherapy  product  and  the  QVA149 
combination product. The small difference in the dose ratio of 3:1 indacaterol/glycopyrronium as used 
in the QVA149 toxicity studies in comparison with the dose ratio of 2.2:1 in the clinical formulation is 
not considered by the Applicant to be significant. The QVA149 toxicology studies were compliant with 
GLP and currently accepted guidelines. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The  mechanism  of  action  of  the  combination  product  QVA149  is  determined  by  the  pharmacology  of 
the two component ligands. Bronchodilation is obtained by directly relaxing the smooth muscle through 
stimulation  of  the  β2-adrenoceptor  with  the  β2-adrenergic  agonist  indacaterol,  and  by  inhibiting  the 
action  of  acetylcholine  at  muscarinic  receptors  with  the  muscarinic  antagonist  glycopyrronium, 
indirectly leading to smooth muscle relaxation. The Applicant has provided a review of literature data 
showing that there is a clear pharmacodynamic rationale for combining indacaterol and glycopyrronium 
in  the  treatment  of  COPD.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  a  study  (RD-2012-00168)  showing 
that  in  the  guinea-pig  isolated  trachea  pre-contracted  with  the  non-selective  muscarinic  agonist 
carbachol, the relaxant effect induced by QVA149 is equivalent to the addition of the relaxant effect of 
Xoterna Breezhaler

indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  applied  on  their  own  although  there  was  no  statistically  significant 
difference  in  the  maximal  inhibition  obtained  with  the  three  tested  compounds  (concentrations 
approximately > 10-8 M). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamics  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were  fully  evaluated  as  part  of 
their individual registration dossiers. No additional studies for QVA149 were required. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology programme included the following studies: 
Study  No  pcs-r0670652-01:  The  effect of  QVA149 on  the  central  nervous  system  and  the  respiratory 
system of the albino rat. 
Study  pcs-r0770861:  Effects  of  QAB149,  NVA237,  and  combination  mixture  QVA149  on  cloned  hERG 
potassium channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. 
Study pcs-r0670653-01: The effect of an inhaled single dose QVA149 on the cardiovascular system in 
male beagle dog using telemetry. 
No  significant  effects  on  central  nervous  or  respiratory  systems  were  observed  following  a  single 
inhaled  dose  of  indacaterol,  glycopyrronium  or  the  combination  at  doses  of  0.496,  0.168  and 
0.405/0.115  mg/kg  respectively.  Slight  transient  changes  were  seen  in  the  form  of  pupil  dilation, 
immediately  following  completion  of  dosing  in  animals  treated  with  QVA149, and  a  slight  decrease  in 
locomotor  activity  levels  noted  at  2  hours  following  treatment  with  indacaterol  monotherapy.  These 
minor changes were not considered adverse. Inhalation of QVA149, indacaterol and glycopyrronium did 
not give rise to effects on tidal volume, respiratory rate, and derived minute volume. The respiratory 
safety pharmacology study did not include a challenge with a bronchoconstrictor agent, as the in vivo 
pharmacology  models  of  lung  function  does,  and  furthermore  the  rat  is  a  poor  responder  to  β2-
adrenergic  agonists.  These  factors  may  explain  the  lack  of  significant  effects  of  QVA149  on  the 
respiratory function in this study.  
When  evaluated  in  vitro,  QVA149  showed  no  additive  inhibitory  effects  on  hERG  current  when 
compared with either of the individual components alone. The concentrations tested were several 100-
fold higher than the free indacaterol and glycopyrronium plasma concentrations at the reported human 
Cmax values after inhaled QVA149. Moreover, no indication of a QTc prolongating effect was observed 
in  an  in  vivo  cardiovascular  study  in  dogs.  However,  in  the  dog  study,  a  decreased  QTc  interval  was 
observed  following  treatment  with  both  QVA149  and  indacaterol  or  glycopyrronium  monotherapy, 
which  was  attributed  to  the  undercorrected  QTc  interval  due  to  markedly  increased  heart  rate. 
Increases  in  heart  rate  were  also  observed  in  all  treated  groups  included  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity 
studies in dogs. Furthermore, transient and variable decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
were  observed  following  treatment  with  QVA149.  In  addition,  ventricular    arrhythmias    (ventricular 
premature complexes, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, late diastolic ectopic ventricular beats) were  
noted    in    one    dog    at    1  hour,  7  hours  and  24  hours  post-dose  following    administration  of 
0.146/0.376 mg/kg QVA149 that were considered a test article effect. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Indacaterol  showed  some  affinity  towards  receptors  and  ion  channels  that  include  calcium  channels 
and dopamine, muscarinic, serotonin and sigma receptors. However it is considered unlikely that such 
interactions  will  be  significant  due  to  the  low  local  and  systemic  exposures  to  indacaterol  following 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report

Page 18/99 
 
 
  
inhalation at the recommended therapeutic dose. In vitro studies showed that glycopyrronium does not 
bind to other drug targets, it is not likely to induce or inhibit metabolism of other drugs, nor processes 
involving  drug  transporters  at  therapeutic  concentrations.  For  these  reasons,  no  pharmacodynamic 
drug interaction studies were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  metabolism  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  are  well  characterized  and 
have  been  extensively  studied  non-clinically,  as  well  as  clinically.  No  differences  in  absorption, 
bioavailability,  tissue  distribution  and  metabolism  of  glycopyrronium  and  indacaterol  are  expected 
between treatments with individual components and with the combination product QVA149.  
The  pharmacokinetic  studies  submitted  in  support  of  the  present  application  are  namely  studies 
describing  the  quantitative  determination  of  indacaterol  in  rat  and  dog  plasma  by  LC  MS/MS  (Study 
Report  numbers  DMPK  R0300366H  and  DMPK  R0300366I),  a  study  assessing  indacaterol  as  an 
inhibitor  of  human  breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP),  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  and  multidrug 
resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) (report no DMPK R0900394) and a study assessing indacaterol 
as  an  inhibitor  of  human  organic  cation  transporters  OCT1,  OCT2,  MATE1  and  MATE2K  (DMPK-
r0900759). 
Concentrations  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  in  plasma  or  serum  of  animals  and  humans  were 
determined by validated assays using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS).  In  rat  and  dog  plasma,  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  for  indacaterol  was  0.2 
ng/mL  and  0.1  ng/mL,  respectively,  and  0.1  ng/mL  for  glycopyrronium  in  both  species.  Both  active 
substances were sufficiently stable in animal and human plasma/serum for the purpose of toxicokinetic 
and clinical studies. 
Below  are the  two  pharmacokinetic drug  interaction  studies  performed  by the  Applicant  with its  main 
results: 
- Indacaterol as an inhibitor of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) (DMPK-R0900394) 
Flow  cytometry  assays  showed  that  Bodipy  FL  prazosin  (BDP)  efflux  from  BCRP-expressing  T8  cells, 
Rhodamine 123 efflux from P-gp-expressing MDA435 T0.3 cells and [14C]Valsartan efflux from MRP2-
expressing MDCKII cells was not inhibited by indacaterol up to a concentration of 50 μM.  
-  Indacaterol  as  an  inhibitor  of  human  organic  cation  transporters  OCT1,  OCT2,  MATE1  and  MATE2K 
(DMPK-r0900759) 
Indacaterol  at  concentrations  up  to  5  μM  maximally  inhibited  hOCT1  and  hOCT2  by  26%  and  19%, 
respectively.  Indacaterol  maximally  inhibited  hMATE1  and  hMATE2K  transport  activity  by  99%  (at  50 
μM)  and  83%  (at  25  μM),  respectively.  The  IC50  values  for  indacaterol  inhibition  of  hMATE1  and 
hMATE2K were 1.26 μM and 26.5 μM, respectively.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  non-clinical  safety  evaluation  of  QVA149  is  based  upon  the  complete  toxicology  programs 
conducted for both individual monotherapy components that included chronic toxicity, reproductive and 
development toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies.

A  bridging  toxicology  program  was  performed  for  QVA149  that  included  2-week  inhalation  toxicity 
studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  a  13-week  inhalation  toxicity  study  in  dogs  and  an  inhalation  embryo-fetal 
development  study  in  rats.  The  dog  was  considered  to  be  the  most  sensitive  toxicological  species 
based on histopathological changes in the heart that are attributable to treatment with indacaterol.  
Indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were  administered  in  the  QVA149  inhalation  toxicity  studies  as  a 
mixture at a drug ratio in terms of the active ingredients of 3:1 (indacaterol/glycopyrronium) to reflect 
the expected clinical dose ratios of the two monotherapy components i.e., 150 μg/day indacaterol and 
50  μg/day glycopyrronium.  The  indacaterol  component  was  subsequently  adjusted  to  a  ratio  of 2.2:1 
(110/50 μg/day indacaterol/glycopyrronium) due to an increase in fine particle mass of indacaterol in 
the QVA149 inhalation powder hard capsules used clinically. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  not  conducted  with  QVA149.  Single  dose  or  short  term  toxicity  was 
evaluated  in  the  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  individual  development  programs  as  part  of  their 
registration dossiers. As the findings during these investigations were consistent with those anticipated 
for inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist or muscarinic antagonist, further single dose toxicity studies were 
not considered necessary by the Applicant to support QVA149 development program. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The following repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed with QVA149 in rats and dogs: a two week 
inhalation  study  in  rats  (0670546),  a  two  week  inhalation  study  in  dogs  (0670547)  and  a  13  week 
inhalation study in dogs (0670756). 
The  following  parameters  were  evaluated  in  the  pivotal  13  week  study  in  dogs:  clinical  signs,  body 
weights,  food  consumption,  electrocardiography,  ophthalmology,  respiratory  minute  volumes, 
haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  Troponin  T,  urinalysis,  toxicokinetics,  gross  pathology,  gross 
observations at necropsy, organ weights, histopathology, mask aerosol concentrations and particle size 
analysis.  
The results from the studies are summarized in the table below.

The  findings  seen  in  the  repeat-dose-toxicity  studies  with  QVA149  were  similar  to  those  observed  in 
the studies performed with glycopyrronium and indacaterol as single treatments.  
Transient  weight  loss  and  decreased  food  consumption  in  connection  with  start  of  treatment  was 
considered  to  be  of  no  toxicological  importance,  as  the  findings  lasted  for  1  to  3  weeks,  and  both 
findings  normalised  thereafter.  Furthermore  some  gastrointestinal  clinical  signs  consisting  of  soft  or 
liquid faeces were observed in the 14 day study. In the 13 week study, slightly increased incidences or 
severities  of  preputial  discharge  (liquid  and  mucoid),  in  some  treated  males  when  compared  to  the 
control males, as well as some sporadic red skin of the pinnae or gums of treated animals. 
There were some indications of an additive effect on heart rate in dogs. Hence, in the two week study, 
inhalation  of  glycopyrronium  (0.123  mg/kg)  and  indacaterol  (0.416  mg/kg/day)  as  single  treatments 
increased the heart rate by approximately 40 % and 12 to 41 %, respectively, 30 min post-dose, while 
the  combination  of  the  two  (0.380/0.126  mg/kg/day)  increased  the  heart  rate  by  57  to  92  %. 
Similarly,  following  13  weeks  treatment,  heart  rate  increases  of  22  to  36  %  and  22  to  58  %  were 
observed  30  minutes  following  inhalation  of  glycopyrronium  (0.140  mg/kg)  and  indacaterol  (0.343 
mg/kg/day),  respectively,  while  the  combination  of  the  two  (0.386/0.125  mg/kg/day)  increased  the 
heart  rate  by  51  to  54  %.  In  the  two-week  dog  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  the  tachycardia  was 
accompanied  by  papillary  muscle  fibrosis  in  animals  exposed  to  0.416  mg/kg  indacaterol  and 
0.380/0.126  mg/kg  indacaterol/glycopyrronium  (QVA149).  Papillary  muscle  fibrosis  was  not observed 
in  the  13  week  dog  study  at  indacaterol  doses  up  to  0.386  mg/kg.  In  the  dog  repeat-dose  studies 
conducted  in  support  of  the  MAA  for  indacaterol  (Onbrez  Breezhaler),  myocardial  fibrosis  in  the 
papillary muscles were observed at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg and 1.1 mg/kg in the two and 13-week study, 
respectively. Exaggerated pharmacological alterations in the heart of dogs dosed with cardiovascularly 
active compounds are well documented. Marked tachycardia increases the oxygen demand. As a result 
of  the  high  demand  and  poor  capillary  perfusion  in  the  subendocardium  of  the  ventricular  papillary 
muscles,  focal  myocardial  necrosis  is  a  common  reaction  (Turton  and  Hooson,  1998).  There  were  no 
indications that combination treatment with indacaterol and glycopyrronium increased the incidence or 
severity of this finding. 
Tachycardia was not reported as an adverse effect in the clinical studies. While QVA149 treatment has 
been  associated  with  an  increase  in  QTc  interval  clinically  at  supratherpeutic  doses,  this  finding  was 
neither made in the dog cardiovascular study nor in the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
The  liver  cytoplasmic  rarefaction  observed  in  dogs  administered  QVA149  (indacaterol  doses  ≥0.1 
mg/kg) and indacaterol monotherapy was also observed at doses ≥0.01 mg/kg in the dog repeat-dose 
studies conducted in support of the MAA for indacaterol where it was described as periportal glycogen 
vacuolisation.  This  effect  has  not  been  noted  in  rats  or  mice.  The  finding  of  increased  levels  of 
hepatocellular  glycogen  in  the  dog  liver,  but  not  the  rat  liver  parallels  the  distribution  of  β-

adrenoceptors in these species, indicating a relationship to pharmacology. The increased hepatocellular 
glycogen  vacuolisation  was  considered  a  secondary  response  related  to  a  combination  of  overnight 
fasting  of the  animals  (up  to  24  hours)  and  increased  lipolysis  and  glucagon receptor  downregulation 
as  a  consequence  of  chronic  β-adrenergic  stimulation.  The  adaptive  response  observed  in  dog 
hepatocytes under fasting conditions was designated as mild. 
A  slight  to  moderate  thymic  lymphoid  atrophy  was  observed  in  males  in  groups  receiving  indacaterol 
(0.343 mg/kg/day).  
Local lung indacaterol exposure multiples based on estimated deposited mass and lung weight at the 
NOAELs in the inhalation toxicity studies were estimated to be 40 to 80-fold higher than anticipated in 
humans at the proposed therapeutic dose. Similarly, the estimated glycopyrronium lung exposure was 
28  to  56-fold  higher  than anticipated in  humans  at  the  proposed therapeutic  dose.  The  mass  median 
aerodynamic  diameter of  the  test  compounds  ranged  from  2.0  to  2.5  µm  hence  they  were  respirable 
and may reach the alveoli. 
Indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were  detected  in  plasma  samples  obtained  from  control  animals  (air 
and  vehicle  control)  included  in  the  two  week  and  13  week  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (study 
0670546,  0670547,  0670756).  Indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were  not  detected  in  the  control 
plasma samples collected as part of the rat embryo-foetal development study. 
At  the  NOAEL  established  in  the  QVA149  inhalation  repeat-dose  toxicity  and  embryo-foetal 
development studies, the indacaterol and glycopyrronium plasma AUC0-24h levels obtained ranged from 
13-79 and 16-126 fold the plasma exposure levels detected in patients treated with the recommended 
therapeutic dose (50 μg glycopyrronium and 110 μg indacaterol). 
It should be noted that the increase in heart rate was observed in all treated dogs and at the lowest 
dose  level  the  detected  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  plasma  exposure  levels  were  ≥15  higher  for 
indacaterol and ≥4.5-fold higher than the plasma exposure levels detected in patients treated with the 
recommended therapeutic dose when based on AUC. Based on Cmax, the lowest QVA149 concentrations 
tested  were  12-fold  and  24-fold  higher  than  clinical  Cmax  for  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium, 
respectively.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not performed with QVA149. The genotoxic potential of the two components 
indacaterol and glycopyrronium was fully evaluated as part of their individual registration dossiers. No 
genotoxic potential was identified for either monotherapy component. Further studies are therefore not 
conducted  in  the  QVA149  development  program  in  line  with  the  guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical 
development of fixed combinations of medical products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  
Carcinogenicity 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  was  assessed  as  part  of  their  individual 
registrations  dossiers.  According  to  the  guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  development  of  fixed 
combinations  of  medical  products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  no  further  evaluation  of 
carcinogenic  potential  is  warranted  if  the  individual  components  are  assessed  as  non-carcinogenic.  If 
there is any concern related to one compound in the combination, the risk that this concern increase 
due to interactions with additional components should be carefully assessed.  
Glycopyrronium neither induced neoplastic changes in a long-term carcinogenicity study in rats nor in a 
26  week  carcinogenicity  study  in  transgenic  mice.  Indacaterol  on  the  other  hand  increased  the 
incidences of ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of the ovarian smooth muscle in female rats, at 
the highest doses administered. These findings were consistent with the known response of rodents to 
Xoterna Breezhaler

treatment with high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists, and were considered to be the consequence of an 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect (Poynter et al 1978). The weight of evidence supports that these 
findings are not of clinical relevance.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Full  non-clinical  reproductive  and  developmental  evaluations  have  previously  been  performed  for 
indacaterol and glycopyrronium as part of their individual registrations dossiers. No adverse effects on 
fertility,  embryo-fetal  development  and  pre-  and  post-natal  development  were  noted 
for 
glycopyrronium.  Indacaterol  increased  the  incidence  of  supernumery  ribs  in  rabbits  however  the 
incidence  of  full  supernumerary  ribs  was  within  the  range  of  the  historical  control  data  and  therefore 
not considered relevant for human safety. Moreover, a NOAEL of 0.1 mg/kg/day was established in the 
pre- and postnatal developmental study for the F0 offspring. At higher dosages (≥0.3 mg/kg/day), an 
increase  in  dying,  stillborn,  missing  and/or  cannibalised  F0 offspring  was  observed  without  significant 
maternal  toxicity.  A  decrease  in  the  number  of  pregnant  F1  offspring  was  observed  in  the  peri-  and 
post-developmental rat study at 1 mg/kg/day. In support of the present application, the applicant has 
conducted  a  QVA149  inhalation  embryo-fetal  development  study  in  rats.  In  this  study,  no  treatment 
related  effects  were  observed  on  the  fetuses.  Maternally,  only  effects  on  body  weight,  body  weight 
gain  and  food  consumption  was  observed,  and  these  effects  were  not  considered  adverse,  and  were 
related to the pharmacological effects of the components of QVA149, indacaterol and glycopyrronium. 
Indacaterol  was  thought  to  increase  muscle  mass  through  a  β2-adrenoreceptor  stimulation,  a  well 
documented  effect  of  this  class  of  compounds  according  to  the  Applicant.    The  decreased  food 
consumption  observed  from  Days  6  to  9  in  the  glycopyrronium  treated  group  (0.62  mg/kg/day)  was 
attributed  to  reduced  salivary  gland  secretion.  In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
glycopyrronium was also associated with reduced food intake and body weight gain. 
The  lack  of  any  further  reproductive  and  developmental  studies  is  considered  acceptable  since  it  is 
considered unlikely that QVA149 will exhibited a different toxicity profile or lead to the aggravation of 
findings when compared to the monotherapies. 
Juvenile toxicity studies were not conducted, as QVA149 is not recommended for use in patients less 
than 18 years of age. 
Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  via  the  intended  clinical  route  of  administration  was  evaluated  as  part  of  the  repeat-
dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  performed  in  rats  and  dogs.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  local 
tolerance guideline (CPMP/SWP/2145/00) which states that stand-alone local tolerance studies are not 
needed when the local reactions can be evaluated as part of the toxicity studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No  non-clinical  studies  to  evaluate  antigenicity  were  required  to  support  the  individual  registration 
dossiers  for  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronuim  as  the  non-clinical  and  human  data  do  not  indicate  any 
potential risk. Specific non-clinical evaluations for the QVA149 combination product were therefore not 
considered necessary. 
Immunotoxicity 
The extensive non-clinical and clinical data available for each monotherapy component do not indicate 
any  potential  effects  on  the  immune  function  that  would  require  immunotoxicity  studies  for  the 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 23/99 
 
  
QVA149  fixed  combination.  These  conclusions  are  further  supported  by  the  results  of  the  2  and  13 
week inhalation studies for QVA149 which did not indicate any relevant effects on immune function. 
Dependence 
Non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  for  QVA149,  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  have  not  indicated  any 
potential for dependence. Specific investigations for QVA149 have therefore not been conducted. 
Metabolites 
No specific non-clinical studies were required to evaluate the toxicity profile of individual metabolites to 
support the individual registration dossiers for indacaterol and glycopyrronium. The toxicity profiles of 
the  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  metabolites  present  in  humans  and  animals  were  however 
appropriately  evaluated  during  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  or  carcinogenicity  studies  performed  for  each 
monotherapy  component.  The  metabolic  profiles  of  indacaterol  or  glycopyrronium  in  QVA149  are 
expected to be comparable with those assessed in the previous toxicity studies for each monotherapy 
component. No unexpected toxicities that would indicate an altered metabolic profile were observed in 
the  2 or 13  Week  inhalation  toxicity  studies  with  QVA149.  Additional  toxicological  studies  to  evaluate 
the individual metabolites were therefore not considered necessary. 
Studies on impurities 
The  current  drug  substance  and  drug  product  specifications  for  indacaterol  or  glycopyrronium  will  be 
maintained  for  QVA149.  No  new  impurities  or  degradation  products  above  the  threshold  for 
toxicological qualification were identified in the QVA149 combination product. 
Formulation excipients 
Magnesium  stearate  and  lactose  used  in  the  QVA149  formulation  are  well  characterized  and  widely 
used  pharmaceutical  excipients.  They  were  assessed  as  part  of  the  registration  dossier  for 
glycopyrronium  based  on  the  lactose/magnesium  stearate  vehicle  control  groups  in  repeated-dose 
inhalation toxicity and carcinogenicity studies that supported this program and on separate inhalation 
toxicity  studies  with  magnesium  stearate  alone  in  rats  up  to  26  weeks  and  dogs  up  to  52  weeks.  
These  studies  confirmed  that  magnesium  stearate  and  lactose  were  not  associated  with  any 
toxicological  or  local  respiratory  tract  tolerance  issues  and  are  therefore  acceptable  inhalation 
formulation excipients for clinical use. 
The  composition  of  the  formulations  used  during  the  QVA149  inhalation  toxicology  studies  are 
considered  appropriate  to  support  the  clinical  use  of  QVA149  dry  powder  capsules  for  inhalation  that 
contain  0.57% indacaterol maleate,  0.25%  glycopyrronium  bromide,  0.15% magnesium  stearate  and 
99.0% lactose. The QVA149 formulations in the 2- and 13-week inhalation toxicology studies and the 
embryo-fetal development study contained 19.2% indacaterol, 6.4% glycopyrronium, 1% magnesium 
stearate  and  73.4%  lactose  monohydrate.  Higher  amounts  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were 
required in the toxicology formulations in comparison with those used clinically in order to fully assess 
the  toxicity  profile  of  QVA149  in  animals  at  delivered  pulmonary  doses  and  systemic  exposure  levels 
above those anticipated in humans. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As  specified  in  the  Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human 
use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  performed  for  each  of 
the  active  compounds  separately.  There  is  no  need  for  additional  experiments  with  the  combination 
product.

The  maximum  daily  dose  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  are  110  μg  and  50  μg  respectively. 
Indacaterol  maleate  undergoes  glucoronidation  and  oxidative  metabolism  and  is  excreted  by  humans 
predominantly via the faecal route, with on average 85% of the dose found in faeces and 10% in urine. 
About 54 % of the initial dose can be found as parent compound in the faeces. 
Following  an  IV  dose  of  14C-labelled  glycopyrronium  bromide,  mass  balance  in  urine  and  bile  was 
almost complete (approximately 90 %), with 85 % of the dose excreted in urine, mostly as unchanged 
drug. Thus, glycopyrronium bromide is mainly eliminated renally and metabolism plays a minor role in 
the elimination process of systemically available drug. 
In addition to the pharmaceutically active ingredients, the drug product contains the commonly used, 
naturally  occurring  excipients  lactose  monohydrate and  magnesium  stearate. These  excipients  do  not 
constitute any risk to the environment. 
The  LogK ow  was  established  experimentally  by  the  shake  flask  method  for  both  indacaterol  and 
glycopyrronium, and was -0.74 and -2.1 respectively.  
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  was  calculated 
for  both 
indacaterol  and 
Glycopyrronium using the formula proposed in the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00): 
PECsurface water = (DOSEai*Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION) 
Indacaterol: 
PECsurface water   = (110 μg *0.01) / (200L/inhabitant/day* 10) 
= 0.00055 μg/L 
Glycopyrronium: 
PECsurface water   = (50 μg *0.01) / (200L/inhabitant/day* 10) 
= 0.00025 μg/L 
Where: 
Dose ai   
= 110 μg/inhabitant/day for indacaterol 
    50 μg/inhabitant/day for glycopyrronium 
Fpen 
= 1 % (default) 
WASTEWinhab 
= 200 L/inhabitant/day 
DILUTION  
= 10 
The  Applicant  concludes  that  the  predicted  environmental  concentrations  for  indacaterol  and 
glycopyrronium are 0.00055 μg/L and 0.00025 μg/L respectively which remain below the trigger value 
of  0.01  μg/L  and  are  not  PBT  substances  as  log  Kow  do  not  exceed  4.5.  The  environmental  risk 
assessment does therefore not proceed to phase II – Tier A and QVA149 is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  metabolism  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  are  well  characterized  and 
have  been  extensively  studied  non-clinically,  as  well  as  clinically.  No  differences  in  absorption, 
bioavailability,  tissue  distribution  and  metabolism  of  glycopyrronium  and  indacaterol  are  expected 
between treatments with individual components and with the combination product QVA149.  
The available data do not indicate that indacaterol and glycopyrronium are likely to interfere with each 
other  pharmacokinetically.  Absence  of  interaction  was  also  demonstrated  in  clinical  studies  as 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  was  similar  when  given  alone  or  in 
combination. 
The  lack  of  any  single  dose  toxicity  studies  for  QVA149  is  in  concordance  with  the  guideline  on  Non-
Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
The  findings  seen  in  the  repeat-dose-toxicity  studies  with  QVA149  were  similar  to  those  observed  in 
the studies performed with glycopyrronium and indacaterol as single treatments.  
Transient  weight  loss  and  decreased  food  consumption  in  connection  with  start  of  treatment  was 
considered  to  be  of  no  toxicological  importance,  as  the  findings  lasted  for  1  to  3  weeks,  and  both 
findings normalised thereafter. 
There were some indications of an additive effect on heart rate in dogs. In the two-week dog repeat-
dose toxicity study, the tachycardia was accompanied by papillary muscle fibrosis in animals exposed 
to  0.416  mg/kg  indacaterol  and  0.380/0.126  mg/kg  indacaterol/glycopyrronium  (QVA149).  Papillary 
muscle fibrosis was not observed in the 13 week dog study at indacaterol doses up to 0.386 mg/kg. In 
the  dog  repeat-dose  studies  conducted  in  support  of  the  MAA  for  indacaterol  (Onbrez  Breezhaler), 
myocardial fibrosis in the papillary muscles were observed at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg and 1.1 mg/kg in the 
two  and  13-week  study,  respectively.  Exaggerated  pharmacological  alterations  in  the  heart  of  dogs 
dosed with cardiovascularly active compounds are well documented. Marked tachycardia increases the 
oxygen demand. As a result of the high demand and poor capillary perfusion in the subendocardium of 
the ventricular papillary muscles, focal myocardial necrosis is a common reaction (Turton and Hooson, 
Xoterna Breezhaler

EMA/CHMP/561242/2013

1998).  There  were  no  indications  that  combination  treatment  with  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium 
increased the incidence or severity of this finding. 
It should be noted that the increase in heart rate was observed in all treated dogs and at the lowest 
dose  level  the  detected  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  plasma  exposure  levels  were  ≥15  higher  for 
indacaterol and ≥4.5-fold higher than the plasma exposure levels detected in patients treated with the 
recommended  therapeutic  dose  when  based  on  AUC.  Based  on  Cmax,  the  lowest  QVA149 
concentrations  tested  were  12-fold  and  24-fold  higher  than  clinical  Cmax  for  indacaterol  and 
glycopyrronium,  respectively.  This  may  explain  why  tachycardia  was  a  consistent  finding  in  the  non-
clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies while it was not observed in the clinical setting. 
Tachycardia was not reported as an adverse effect in the clinical studies. While QVA149 treatment has 
been  associated  with  an  increase  in  QTc  interval  clinically  at  supratherapeutic  doses,  this  was  finding 
was neither made in the dog cardiovascular study nor in the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
The  liver  cytoplasmic  rarefactions  observed  in  dogs  administered  QVA149  (indacaterol  doses  ≥0.1 
mg/kg)  and  indacaterol  monotherapy  were  also  observed  at  doses  ≥0.01  mg/kg  in  the  dog  repeat-
dose  studies  conducted  in  support  of  the  MAA  for  indacaterol  (Onbrez  Breezhaler)  where  it  was 
described  as  periportal  glycogen  vacuolisation.  This  effect  has  not  been  noted  in  rats  or  mice.  The 
finding of increased levels of hepatocellular glycogen in the dog liver, but not the rat liver parallels the 
distribution  of  β-adrenoceptors  in  these  species,  indicating  a  relationship  to  pharmacology.  The 
increased  hepatocellular  glycogen  vacuolisation  was  considered  a  secondary  response  related  to  a 
combination of overnight fasting of the animals (up to 24 hours) and increased lipolysis and glucagon 
receptor  downregulation  as  a  consequence  of  chronic  β-adrenergic  stimulation.  As  the  adaptive 
response  observed  in  dog  hepatocytes  under  fasting  conditions  was  designated  as  mild,  it  is  not 
considered to have any significant consequence for patients during normal therapeutic use of QVA149. 
With regards to the non-statistically significant decrease in thymus weight in the treated animals, the 
cause  could  not  be  firmly  established.  However,  as  the  thymic  involution  due  to  stress  is  well 
established, this hypothesis is supported. This finding was reversible. Overall, the clinical relevance of 
this finding is considered to be minor. 
Local lung indacaterol exposure multiples based on estimated deposited mass and lung weight at the 
NOAELs in the inhalation toxicity studies were estimated to be 40 to 80-fold higher than anticipated in 
humans  at  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose  (please  refer  to the  tables  below). Similarly, the  estimated 
glycopyrronium  lung  exposure  was  28  to  56-fold  higher  than  anticipated  in  humans  at  the  proposed 
therapeutic dose. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the test compounds ranged from 2.0 to 
2.5 µm hence they were respirable and may reach the alveoli. 
Indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  was  detected  in  plasma  samples  obtained  from  control  animals  (air 
and  vehicle  control)  included  in  the  two  week  and  13  week  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (study 
0670546,  0670547,  0670756).  Since  only  a  few  animals  were  affected  and  the  measured 
concentrations  were  generally  much  lower  than  the  Cmax  in  the  low  dose  groups  (except  one 
glycopyrronium  sample  in  the  14   day  rat  study  no  0670546),  it  is  considered  that  these  findings  do 
not  affect  the  integrity  and  conclusions  of  the  studies.  Indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  were  not 
detected in the control plasma samples collected as part of the rat embryo-fetal development study. 
At the NOAEL established in the QVA149 inhalation repeat-dose toxicity and embryo-fetal development 
studies,  the  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  plasma  AUC0-24h  levels  obtained  ranged  from  13-79  and 
16-126 fold the plasma exposure levels detected in patients treated with the recommended therapeutic 
dose (50 μg glycopyrronium and 110 μg indacaterol).

The lack of genotoxicity studies for the indacterol/glycopyrronium combination is acceptable according 
to  the  guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  development  of  fixed  combinations  of  medical  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
According to the guideline on the Non-Clinical development of fixed combinations of medical products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  no  further  evaluation  of  carcinogenic  potential  is  warranted  if  the 
individual  components  are  assessed  as  non-carcinogenic.  If  there  is  any  concern  related  to  one 
compound  in  the  combination,  the  risk  that  this  concern  increase  due  to  interactions  with  additional 
components should be carefully assessed.  
Glycopyrronium neither induced neoplastic changes in a long-term carcinogenicity study in rats nor in a 
26  week  carcinogenicity  study  in  transgenic  mice.  Indacaterol  on  the  other  hand  increased  the 
incidences of ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of the ovarian smooth muscle in female rats, at 
the highest doses administered. These findings were consistent with the known response of rodents to 
treatment with high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists, and were considered to be the consequence of an 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect (Poynter et al 1978). The weight of evidence supports that these 
findings are not of clinical relevance.  
As  such,  it  is  considered  acceptable  that  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  the  indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
combination is not evaluated in dedicated studies. 
Full  non-clinical  reproductive  and  developmental  evaluations  have  previously  been  performed  for 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium.  No  adverse  effects  on  fertility,  embryo-fetal  development  and  pre- 
and  post-natal  development  were  noted  for  glycopyrronium.  Indacaterol  increased  the  incidence  of 
supernumery ribs in rabbits however the incidence of full supernumerary ribs was within the range of 
the historical control data and therefore not considered relevant for human safety. Moreover, a NOAEL 
of 0.1 mg/kg/day was established in the pre- and postnatal developmental study for the F0 offspring. 
At  higher  dosages  (≥0.3  mg/kg/day),  an  increase  in  dying,  stillborn,  missing  and/or  cannibalised  F0 
offspring was observed without significant maternal toxicity. A decrease in the number of pregnant F1 
offspring  was  observed  in  the  peri-  and  post-developmental  rat  study  at  1  mg/kg/day.  In  support  of 
the  present  application,  the  applicant  has  conducted  a  QVA149  inhalation  embryo-fetal  development 
study in rats. The lack of any further reproductive and developmental studies is considered acceptable 
since  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  QVA149  will  exhibited  a  different  toxicity  profile  or  lead  to  the 
aggravation of findings when compared to the monotherapies. 
In the indacaterol/glycopyrronium combination embryo-fetal development study, no treatment related 
effects  were  observed  on  the  fetuses.  Maternally,  only  effects  on  body  weight,  body  weight  gain  and 
food consumption was observed, and these effects  were not considered adverse, and  were related to 
the  pharmacological  effects  of  the  components  of  QVA149,  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium. 
Indacaterol  was  thought  to  increase  muscle  mass  through  a  β2-adrenoreceptor  stimulation,  a  well 
documented  effect  of  this  class  of  compounds  according  to  the  Applicant.  The  decreased  food 
consumption  observed  from  Days  6  to  9  in  the  glycopyrronium  treated  group  (0.62  mg/kg/day)  was 
attributed  to  reduced  salivary  gland  secretion.  In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
glycopyrronium was also associated with reduced food intake and body weight gain. 
No  juvenile  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  as  QVA149  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  patients  less 
than 18 years of age. The PDCO has granted QVA149 a product specific waiver since COPD only occurs 
in adults (EMEA/43543/2008) and the lack of a juvenile toxicity study is deemed acceptable. 
This is in concordance with the local tolerance guideline (CPMP/SWP/2145/00), as the need for stand-
alone local tolerance studies are not needed when the local reactions can be evaluated as part of the 
toxicity studies.

The  PECsurfacewater  values  both  for  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  are  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01 
μg/L and are not PBT substances as log Kow do not exceed 4.5. Considering the above data, QVA149 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  provided  non-clinical  package  is  considered  adequate  to  support  a  MAA  for  the  fixed  dose 
combination  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  in  the  treatment  of  COPD.  An  additive  relaxant  effect 
was  indicated  following  combination  treatment  with  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  in  the  guinea-pig 
isolated  trachea  pre-contracted  with  the  non-selective  muscarinic  agonist  carbachol.  Moreover, 
indacaterol and glycopyrronium induced an additive increase in heart rate in the cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study and repeat-dose toxicity studies when compared to the single therapies. However, 
no new or aggravated toxicities resulted from the combination treatment in the conducted repeat-dose 
and embryo-fetal development toxicity studies when compared to the findings induced by indacaterol 
and glycopyrronium as single therapies. 
There  are  no  non-clinical  issues  outstanding  and  it  is  considered  adequate  to  support  a  MAA  for  the 
fixed dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium in the treatment of COPD.

Two  pivotal  studies  supporting  the  symptom  relief  claim,  A2303  and  A2313,  investigated  the 
efficacy  of  QVA149  on  trough  FEV1  for  26  weeks  compared  to  QAB149,  NVA237,  tiotropium  and 
placebo (A2303) and on FEV1AUC0-12 compared to fluticasone/salmeterol (A2313). The pivotal study 
supporting  the  exacerbation  claim,  A2304,  investigated  the  rate  of  moderate  to  severe  COPD 
exacerbations in patients treated with QVA149 compared to NVA237 and tiotropium. A2305 was a 3-
week  study  evaluating  exercise  endurance.  Study  2307  was  a  52  weeks  long-term  safety  study  in 
patients with moderate to severe COPD.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  total  of  eight  studies  provided  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  data  for  the 
fixed-dose combination of indacaterol maleate/ and glycopyrronium bromide (QVA149). Five of the 
studies were conducted in healthy subjects (Table 1-1) and three in patients with COPD (Table 1-2):

The  relative  bioavailability  of  QVA149  and  monotherapy  components  was  investigated  in  healthy 
subjects  [Study  A2101],  [Study  A2103],  [Study  A2106]  and  patients  [Study  A2204],  [Study  A2303], 
[A2303-Population-PKReport-PK  analysis].  The  pharmacokinetics  of  QVA149  were  compared  between 
Japanese  and  Caucasian  healthy  subjects  in  [Study  CQVA149A1101].  The  bronchodilator  profile  of 
QVA149  was  assessed  in  COPD  patients  [Study  A2303]  and  secondary  systemic  PD  effects  were 
assessed in healthy subjects [Study A2105] and COPD patients [Study A2203]. 
Absorption  
Following single and repeat doses via oral inhalation of QVA149, indacaterol and glycopyrronium were 
rapidly absorbed, reaching peak systemic concentrations within 15 min and 5 min post-dose. 
No  absolute  bioavailability  study  has  been  performed  with  the  fixed-dose  combination  of  indacaterol 
maleate/and glycopyrronium bromide (QVA149). The absolute bioavailability of inhaled indacaterol and 
glycopyrronium was obtained in earlier mono-component studies. 
Absolute bioavailability of inhaled indacaterol was estimated to be 45 %. About 75 % of the indacaterol 
systemic exposure after inhalation of the monocompound resulted from deposition to, and absorption 
from the lungs, and 25 % resulted from absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. 
The absolute bioavailability of inhaled glycopyrronium was estimated to be about 40 %. About 90 % of 
systemic  exposure  following  inhalation  is  due  to  lung  absorption  and  10  %  is  due  to  gastrointestinal 
absorption. 
Total  systemic  exposure  to  indacaterol  achieved  with  the  QVA149  110/50  μg  formulation  ranged 
between  23%  lower  than  and  8%  higher  than  the  exposure  achieved  with  indacaterol  150  μg 
monotherapy.  Based  on  this  data,  the  Applicant  estimates  absolute  bioavailability  of  indacaterol  from 
inhaled  QVA149  110/50  μg  to  approximately  47  %  to  66  %.  For  glycopyrronium,  total  systemic 
exposure  achieved  with  the  QVA149  110/50  μg  formulation  was  similar  to  that  achieved  with  the 
glycopyrronium  monotherapy  product  50  μg.  The  absolute  bioavailability  value  reported  after 
inhalation of glycopyrronium for the fixed dose combination QVA149 110/50 μg was of about 40%. 
The  relative  bioavailability  of  QVA149  and  monotherapy  components  were  investigated  in  healthy 
subjects  [Study  CQVA149A2101],  [Study  CQVA149A2103],  [Study  CQVA149A2106]  and  in  patients 
[Study CQVA149A2204], [Study CQVA149A2303], [CQVA149A2303-Population-PKReport-PK analysis]. 
The dose of 110 μg indacaterol in QVA149 was chosen to provide exposures similar to that seen with 
150  μg  in  the  monotherapy  component  by  ensuring  a  similar  Fine  Particle  Mass  (FPM)  in  both 
formulations. 
Study  CQVA149A2101  was  an  open label,  single-centre,  randomized,  single-dose,  four-way  crossover 
study  to  assess  the  relative  bioavailability  of  a  single  inhaled  dose  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium 
when  administered  alone,  in  free,  or  in  fixed  combination  in  healthy  subjects  (n=28).  The  systemic 
exposure  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  QVA149  300/100  μg  was  contrasted  with  that  of  300  μg 
indacaterol  or  100  μg  glycopyrronium  administered  alone,  and  with  the  free  combination  of  300  μg 
indacaterol and 100 μg glycopyrronium.  
In  this  high  dose  study,  the  total  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  to  indacaterol  achieved  with  the 
QVA149  300/100  μg  formulation  was  25%  higher  than  the  exposure  achieved  with  the  mono-
component indacaterol 300 µg. However, the dose of 110 μg indacaterol in QVA149 was chosen 
by  the  Applicant  to  provide  exposures  similar  to  that  seen  with  150  μg  in  the  monotherapy 
component by ensuring a similar Fine Particle Mass (FPM); thus, to provide a similar exposure to 
FPM the dose of 300 µg indacaterol monotherapy in this study was too low to be comparable with 
the fixed dosage combination 300/100 µg. Bioequivalence was not shown for glycopyrronium due 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 32/99 
 
  
to a too wide CI for Cmax. No safety signal was detected in the cohort. 
Study CQVA149A2103 was a randomised, open-label, three-way crossover study designed to compare 
the  systemic  exposure  of  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  following  multiple  inhaled  doses  of 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  when  administered  alone  or  as  QVA149  in  43    healthy  subjects.  The 
systemic exposure of the fixed-dose combination QVA149 110/50 μg was contrasted with that of 150 
μg indacaterol or 50 μg glycopyrronium administered alone.  
The Applicant claims that total steady-state systemic exposure (AUC(0-24h)) to indacaterol was 
similar for the fixed-dose combination QVA149 110/50 μg compared to indacaterol 150 μg alone, 
and thus that standard bioequivalence criteria were met for AUC(0-24h) of indacaterol. However, 
the lack of bioequivalence between the 110 µg indacaterol in the fixed dose combination QVA149 
compared to 150 µg indacaterol in the monotherapy is not considered essential by the CHMP. 
The  treatment  ratio  differences  for  indacaterol observed  between  studies  A2103  and  A2106  are 
likely  to  reflect  differences  in  exposure  from  the  QAB149  150  µg  mono  component  rather  than 
from the fixed-dose combination QVA149 110/50 µg. This is supported the differences in the FPM 
of indacaterol in the monotherapy batches used in Study A2103. 
The reduction of the glycopyrronium FPM of about 25% in the NVA237 monotherapy batch used 
in  Study  A2103  is  the  likely  reason  why  the  glycopyrronium  exposure  ratios  for  QVA149  vs. 
NVA237 were significantly higher than 1.0. 
The  superior  efficacy  observed  with  the  QVA149  is  likely  to  be  solely  an  additive/synergistic 
effect  of  combining  the  two  components  and  not  due  to  higher  exposure  of  one  or  both 
monocomponents. No safety signal was detected in the cohort. 
Study  CQVA149A2106  was  a  randomised,  open-label,  four-period  cross-over  study  designed  to 
compare the systemic exposure of indacaterol and glycopyrronium following multiple inhaled doses of 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  when  administered  alone  or  as  QVA149  in  24  healthy  subjects.  The 
systemic exposure of indacaterol and glycopyrronium from the fixed-dose combination QVA149 110/50 
μg was contrasted with that of 150 μg indacaterol or 50 μg glycopyrronium administered alone or in a 
free combination.  
In  this  study,  standard  bioequivalence  criteria  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  and  the 
monocomponents  were  only  fulfilled  for  glycopyrronium.  The  data  for  indacaterol  show  an 
AUC(0-24h)  and  Cmax  23%  and  19%,  lower  for  QVA149  than  for  indacaterol  (150  μg)  given 
alone, respectively. No safety signal was detected in the cohort. 
Study  CQVA149A2204  was  a  randomised,  double  blind,  4-period  cross-over,  multi-center  study  to 
determine the effect of QVA149 300/50 μg on lung function versus placebo in patients with moderate 
to severe stable COPD. Secondary objectives included the comparison of the bronchodilatory efficacy of 
QVA149 300/50 μg versus indacaterol 300 μg and indacaterol 600 μg following 7 days of treatment, to 
assess the safety and tolerability of QVA149 and to evaluate the PK of glycopyrronium and indacaterol 
after  oral  inhalation  of  QVA149  and  to  compare  the  systemic  exposure  to  indacaterol  when  delivered 
alone and in fixed combination. 
In this patient study the PK analysis showed that systemic exposure to indacaterol from the fixed 
dose combination QVA149 300/50 μg was similar to the exposure from indacaterol 300 μg alone. 
Also  the  systemic  exposure  of  glycopyrronium  following  inhalation  of  QVA  300/50  μg 
corresponded to the expected level for this dose.  
Study  CQVA149A2303  was  a  26-week  treatment,  multi-center,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel 
group,  placebo-  and  active-controlled  (open  label  with  regards  to  tiotropium)  study  to  assess  the

efficacy, safety and tolerability of QVA149 (110/50 μg q.d.) compared to placebo, indacaterol 150 μg, 
glycopyrronium 50 μg and tiotropium 18 μg in patients with moderate to severe COPD.  
The  data  shows  that  the  QVA149  110/50  µg  fixed-dose  formulation  delivers  similar  amounts  of 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  to  the  lung  as  the  QAB149  150  µg  and  NVA237  50  µg  monotherapy 
products.  
Distribution 
The  blood  distribution  and  plasma  protein  binding  of  the  individual  components  of  QVA149  were 
investigated  and  were  not  anticipated  to  behave  differently  when  administered  in  combination. 
Therefore, no additional in vitro studies have been performed with the combination drug QVA149. 
After intravenous administration of indacaterol, serum clearance was moderate (18.8 L/h to 23.3 L/h), 
and  a  large  volume  of  distribution  was  observed  (volume  of  distribution  in  the  terminal  phase  (Vz) 
=2361 L to 2557 L, volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) = 1362 L). 
The in vitro human serum and plasma protein binding is high, ranging from 94.1 to 95.3 and 95.1 to 
96.2  %  respectively.  Mild-to-moderate  hepatic  impairment  does  not  alter  the  protein  binding  of 
indacaterol. Indacaterol has an in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.2. 
After intravenous (i.v.) dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of glycopyrronium was 83 
L  and  the  volume  of  distribution  in  the  terminal  phase  (Vz)  was  376  L.  The  apparent  volume  of 
distribution  in  the  terminal  phase  following  inhalation  (Vz/F)  was  7310  L,  which  reflects  the  much 
slower elimination after inhalation. 
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of glycopyrronium was 38 % to 41 % at concentrations of 1 
ng/mL to 10 ng/mL. 
Elimination 
Elimination  and  excretion  of  the  individual  components  of  QVA149,  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium, 
had been studied previously. Since no difference was anticipated for the combination drug QVA149, no 
additional clinical studies have been performed by the Applicant with QVA149. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life 
ranging  from  45.5  hours  to  126  hours.  The  effective  half-life,  calculated  from  the  accumulation  of 
indacaterol  after  repeated  dosing  ranged  from  40  hours  to  56  hours  which  is  consistent  with  the 
observed time-to-steady state of approximately 12 days to 15 days 
Glycopyrronium  plasma  concentrations  declined  in  a  multi-phasic  manner.  The  mean  terminal 
elimination  half-life  was  much  longer  after  inhalation  (33  hours  to  57  hours)  than  after  intravenous 
(6.2  hours)  and  oral  (2.8  hours)  administration.  This  indicates  a  sustained  lung  absorption  and/or 
transfer of glycopyrronium into the systemic circulation at and beyond 24 h after inhalation. 
The amount of indacaterol excreted unchanged in urine is generally less than 2 % of the dose. Renal 
clearance of indacaterol was, on average, between 0.46 and 1.20 L/h (about 2 % to 6 % of systemic 
clearance). 
The fecal route of excretion is dominant over the urinary route. Indacaterol was excreted into human 
feces primarily as unchanged parent drug (54 % of the dose) and, to a lesser extent, as hydroxylated 
indacaterol metabolites (23 % of the dose)

Page 34/99 
 
  
Concerning glycopyrronium, renal elimination of parent drug accounts for about 60 % to 70 % of total 
clearance of systemically available glycopyrronium whereas non-renal clearance processes account for 
about 30 % to 40 %. 
Biliary  clearance  contributes  to  the  non-renal  clearance,  but  the  majority  of  non-renal  clearance  is 
thought to be due to metabolism. 
Following  inhalation  of  single  and  repeated  once-daily  doses  between  50  μg  and  200  μg 
glycopyrronium by healthy volunteers and patients with COPD mean renal clearance of glycopyrronium 
was in the range of 17.4 L/h and 24.4 L/h. Active tubular secretion contributes to the renal elimination 
of glycopyrronium. Up to 20 % of the dose was found in urine as parent drug. 
The excretion processes of indacaterol and glycopyrronium are not expected to interact. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  dose-proportionality  of  the  monotherapy  products  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  has  been 
established and dose proportionality of the component analytes of QAV149 110/50 μg was not formally 
assessed in a single study. 
In study CQVA149A1101 pharmacokinetics was evaluated following single inhaled doses of 110/50 μg 
and 220/100 μg (administered as 2 capsules of QVA149 110/50 μg) in Japanese and Caucasian healthy 
subjects.  Therefore  an  exploratory  evaluation  of  dose  proportionality  of  the  components  of  QAV149 
110/50 μg was performed. 
Mean  Cmax  of  indacaterol and  glycopyrronium  appeared  to increase  dose  proportionally  in  both  ethnic 
groups (2-fold). The increase in mean AUC0-24h and AUClast with dose, ranged from 2.1-fold to 2.4-fold 
and  2.14-fold  and  3.34-fold,  respectively  across  ethnic  groups.  Dose  proportionality  is  in  line  with 
previous findings of the monotherapy products. 
Regarding time dependency in healthy volunteers, the trough plasma concentrations of indacaterol and 
glycopyrronium  were  stable  from  Day  12  to  Day  15  in  both  studies  indicating  that  pharmacokinetic 
steady state was reached on Day 14.  
For  COPD  patients,  4-h  plasma  concentrations  curves  at  day  29  and  85  are  not  suggestive  of  time-
dependent pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
A  population  PK  modeling  analysis  of  QVA149  was  performed  using  data  from  the  study 
CQVA149A2303 in order to address the differences between mono-component and fixed-dose kinetics 
and the impact of relevant covariant at the PK of indacaterol and glycopyrronium. Covariates were as 
follows:  demographic  variables  (age,  gender,  body  weight,  body  mass  index,  and  race)  and  disease 
characteristics (smoking history, percent predicted FEV1 at study entry).  
The  PK-population  analysis  support  the  general  observation  that  there  is  a  decrease  in  overall 
exposure  to  indacaterol  when  administered  as  fixed  dose  combination  (QVA149  110  μg).  It  is 
approximately 10% lower compared to when it is given in monotherapy component (dose at 150 μg ) 
at peak and 16% lower with respect to AUC(0-4h).  
The overall exposure of glycopyrronium is similar when given as monotherapy component and as fixed 
dose combination. 
The body weight affects systemic exposure of both indacaterol and glycopyrronium. However, there is 
a large variability in the systemic exposure for both drugs, and in the clinic dose adjustments based on 
body weight are found to be unnecessary.

When  corrected  by  lean  body  weight,  no  statistically  significant  direct  effect  of  ethnicity  (Japanese 
versus non-Japanese) on exposure for any of the two compounds was found in COPD patients. 
Age,  gender  FEV1,  disease  severity,  smoking  history  did  not  affect  the  PK  of  the  fixed  dose 
combination QVA149 (110µg/50µg) in a clinically relevant way.  
It seems that QVA149 can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR>30), and in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with 
severe  renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease  requiring  dialysis  QVA149  should  be  used  only  if 
the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro and in vitro studies, the interaction potential of both indacaterol and glycopyrronium 
appears to be low when used in the applied doses.  
Systemic  clearance  of  indacaterol  is  influenced  by  modulation  of  both  P-gp  and  CYP3A4  activities. 
Presently there are no safety concerns.  
Available safety data on treatment with indacaterol in clinical trials of up to one year at doses two- to 
four-fold the recommended therapeutic dose has not given any safety concerns.  
Regarding glycopyrronium, cimetidine has been shown to interact with OCT2 and increase both Cmax 
and  AUC  approximately  20-25%.  However  interactions  between  glycopyrronium  and  other  OCT2 
inhibitors/substrates are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In  vitro  studies  for  individual  components  of  QVA149  demonstrated  that  both  indacaterol  and 
glycopyrronium  have  little  or  no  capacity  to  inhibit  CYP  isoenzymes,  ABC  efflux  transporters  or  SLC 
uptake  transporters.  All  the  individually  assessed  IC50  or  Ki  values  were  much  higher  than  the 
indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  steady-state  plasma  concentrations  during  QVA149  therapy  or  the 
estimated  concentrations  in  the  gut  lumen.  Therefore,  exposure  alterations  of  drugs  that  are  mainly 
cleared  through  metabolism  by  the  major  CYP  isoenzymes  and/or  of  drugs  whose  absorption  or 
disposition is mediated by well-known transporter proteins are unlikely in the presence of indacaterol 
and  glycopyrronium.  All  mRNA  as  well  as  activity  data  in  primary  human  hepatocytes  suggest  that 
there  would  be  no  clinically  relevant  induction  of  any  metabolic  and  active  transport  process  by 
glycopyrronium and/or indacaterol at therapeutic concentrations. 
Based on in vitro studies, the interaction potential of both indacaterol and glycopyrronium appears to 
be low when used in the applied strengths. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Indacaterol  is  a  long-acting  β2-adrenergic  agonist  for  once-daily  administration.  The  pharmacological 
effects  of  β2-adrenoceptor  agonists,  including  indacaterol,  are  at  least  in  part  attributable  to 
stimulation  of  intracellular  adenyl  cyclase,  the  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  conversion  of  adenosine 
triphosphate  (ATP)  to  cyclic-3,5-adenosine  monophosphate  (cyclic  monophosphate).  Increased  cyclic 
AMP levels results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. Local β2-adrenoceptor activation in airway 
smooth muscle following oral inhalation leads to relaxation, which results in bronchodilation.

Parasympathetic  nerves  are  the  major  bronchoconstrictor  neural  pathway  in  airways,  and  cholinergic 
tone  is  the  major  reversible  component  in  COPD.  Stimulation  of  these  nerves  results  in  release  of 
acetylcholine  (ACh)  that  acts  at  multiple  muscarinic  receptor  subtypes.  Of  the  five  known  muscarinic 
receptor  subtypes  (M1-5),  subtypes  M1-3  appear  to  be  of  relevance  in  the  human  lung. 
Glycopyrronium  is  a  highly  potent  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  at  the  M1,  M2  and  M3  receptor 
subtypes. It demonstrates some selectivity for the human M3 and M1 over the human M2 receptor. 
When  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  are  administered  together  it  would  be  expected  that  they 
provide additive efficacy due to their different mode of action targeting different receptors to achieve 
small muscle relaxation. 
The  mechanisms  of  action  for  beta-2-receptor  agonists  and  for  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  in 
obstructive  airway  disease  are  well  established.  The  combination  of  long-acting  beta-2-agonists  and 
long-acting  anticolinergic  is  recommended  as  second  choice  in  the  initial  pharmacologic  management 
of COPD patients  diagnosed with mild to moderate disease or worse (stages B to D). 
Three  studies  relevant  for  understanding  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  QVA149  110/50  have  been 
provided by the applicant. The bronchodilator effect profile of QVA149 was assessed in COPD patients 
[Study  A2303]  and  secondary  systemic  PD  effects  were  assessed  in  healthy  subjects  [Study  A2105] 
and COPD patients [Study A2203]. 
For  QVA149  the  choice  of  the  dose  (110  µg/50  µg)  and  rationale  was  supported  by  CHMP  in  the 
scientific advice given in 2009 to be the most appropriate dose and regimen for evaluation in the Phase 
III clinical program. Thus, additional efficacy dose-finding studies were not performed for QVA149 by 
the  applicant,  and  QVA149  110/50  μg  once  daily  was  investigated  in  all  Phase  III  studies.  The 
applicant was asked to discuss whether a dose of 75 µg indacaterol for the long term maintenance of 
airflow  obstructions  in  adults  with  COPD  once  a  day  could  have  been  enough  in  the  combination 
product. For glycopyrronium in monotherapy, a previous study completed by the Applicant, showed a 
better effect on trough FEV1 after 28 days of treatment with 25 µg and 50 µg b.i.d compared to 50 µg 
q.d;  and  a  discussion  of  a  twice  daily  dosing  regimen  for  QVA149  was  requested  from  the  Applicant. 
The provided discussion was satisfactory.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacology  of  QVA149  110/50  was  addressed  by  the  Applicant  in  study  A2303  and 
included the bronchodilatory effect, the bronchodilator response profile over 24h, the standardized AUC 
for FEV1 (L) and Peak and Trough FEV1 response of QVA149. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the superiority of QVA149 110/50 μg compared 
to  both  QAB149  150  μg  and  NVA237  50  μg  in  terms  of  trough  Forced  Expiratory  Volume  In  One 
Second (FEV1), following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The study 
met  its  primary  objective  by  demonstrating  the  superiority  of  QVA149  110/50  μg  compared  to  both 
QAB149  150μg  and  NVA237  50μg  in  terms  of  trough  FEV1  following  26  weeks  of  treatment,  with  a 
statistically significant improvement of 90 mL compared to NVA237 and 70 mL compared to QAB149. 
QVA149  110/50  demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  after  26  weeks  of 
treatment  compared  to  both  placebo  (LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  200mL)  and  tiotropium  (LS 
mean treatment difference of 80 mL). This study is addressed in detail in the efficacy section. 
In  the  study,  QVA149  110/50  provided  a  fast  onset  of  action  with  bronchodilatory  effects  apparent 
after 5 minutes on the first day of treatment. At 5 min post-dose, the treatment difference for QVA149 
was  130  mL  compared  to  placebo,  40  mL  compared  to  NVA237  and  70  mL  compared  to  tiotropium. 
The  bronchodilator  profile  of  QVA149,  QAB149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium  showed  a  consistent 
bronchodilator  effect  over  the  24-hour  treatment  interval.  In  addition,  it  was  confirmed  that  QVA149 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 37/99 
 
  
has  an  additive  effect  when  compared  to  its  monotherapy  components.  After  26  weeks  of  treatment 
the standardized FEV1 was statistically significantly greater in the QVA149 treatment group (LS mean 
difference 0.32 L) compared to placebo. A statistically superior response was also observed for QVA149 
compared  to  QAB149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium  (LS  mean  difference  0.11  L).  The  effect  of  QVA149 
remained  constant  over  the  full  treatment  period  of  26  weeks  and  there  was  no  signal  for 
tachyphylaxis with QVA149 over time. 
As  bronchodilator  effects  are  related  to  topical  drug  disposition  in  the  lung,  a  clinically  meaningful 
association between plasma concentration and effects is unlikely. 
The  side  effect  profile  of  inhaled  high  doses  of  QVA149  was  explored  in  the  Phase  I  Study  A2105  in 
healthy subjects and in Study A2203 in COPD patients. In these studies supra-therapeutic doses were 
administered  to  study  participants  and  the  safety  and  secondary  pharmacodynamics  of  QVA149  were 
investigated as primary objectives. 
The systemic side effects of inhaled β2adrenergic agonists and inhaled antimuscarinic drugs, like QVA, 
are  the  result  of  activation  of  the  systemic  β2-adrenergic  receptors  and  blockade  of  muscarinic 
cholinergic  receptors  after  systemic  absorption  of  the  drugs.    Heart  rate  is  considered  a  sensitive 
parameter  since  both  β2-adrenergic  stimulation  and  muscarinic  cholinergic  receptor  blockade  can 
contribute to an increase in heart rate. 
In the healthy  volunteers, heart rate increased statistically significantly with 5.69 bpm and 4.00 bpm 
from baseline for QVA149(440/200 μg) versus placebo at 1h 10m post dose and at 1h 30m post dose 
with the upper 90% CI being below 10 bpm for both observations. There was a tachycardic potential of 
QVA149 when compared to glycopyrronium, thus the heart rate increased statistically significantly with 
5.20 bpm at 1h 10m post dose. This is in line with the QVA149 vs. placebo-results and indicates that 
indacaterol could be the part of the fixed drug combination mainly responsible for the increase in heart 
rate. 
The effect of 14 days treatment with QVA149 600/100 μg, QVA149 300/100 μg, QVA149 150/100 μg 
on cardiac safety compared to placebo was evaluated in COPD patients (study A2203). The mean 24-
hour heart rate and mean change from baseline in 24 hour heart rate on Day 14 showed no statistical 
difference  between  QVA149  treatment  groups  and  placebo.  The  heart  rates  were  investigated  at 
specific time points after dosing, 30 min, 4 h and 24 h after dosing. There was a numerical increase in 
heart rate in all treatments including placebo at the 4 h time points with no major differences between 
treatments.  The  observed  ranges  for  heart  rate  were  very  wide  and  overlapping  for  all  treatments 
(ranges:-29 to 30 at 30 min.; -28 to 50 at 4h; -19 to 17 at 24 h) 
β2  adrenergic  agonists  are  known  to  prolong  QT-interval.  In  the  dossier  no  study  was  primarily 
dedicated  to  evaluate  effect  of  QVA149  110/50  on  cardiac  repolarization.  Thus,  no  thorough  QT/QTc 
study was performed by the Applicant. However, the cardiac effect of QVA149, QTcF was analyzed as a 
secondary PD-parameter in Study A2105 in healthy subjects and in Study A2203 in COPD patients. The 
Applicant commented that according to the ICH E14 guideline, in such settings in healthy volunteers, a 
compound  is  considered  to  have  no  relevant  effect  on  QT-interval  when  the  largest  time-matched 
mean  difference  is  less  than  5  ms  and  the  upper  bound  of  the  2-sided  90%  CI  is  below  10  ms, 
compared to placebo. This was the case in this study, and the response is considered acceptable. 
For the healthy volunteers, QVA149 increased significantly QTcF when compared to placebo with 4.62 
ms (90% CI 0.40, 8.85 ms), at 1h 30 m, and when compared to glycopyrronium with 6.42 ms at 3h 
55m.  Also  when  compared  with  the  high  dose  indacaterol  (600µg),  QVA149  (440µg/200µg) 
significantly increased QTcF with 4.88 ms at 3 h 55 m. 
For COPD Patients no QTcF changes > 60 ms were observed across any of the treatment groups in the 
study. However, the proportion of patients with changes in QTcF in the range 30-60ms in the QVA149 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report

600/100 μg, 300/100 μg, 150/100 μg, QAB149 300 μg and placebo groups were 20.4%, 21.6 %, 16.0 
%, 19.6 % and 1.9%, respectively. QTc-prolongations above 450 ms were more frequently recorded in 
the  QVA149  600/100  μg  treatment  group  (12.2  %)  versus  5.7  %  in  the  placebo  group.  Thus,  data 
suggest that there could be a positive correlation between a high dose of QVA149 and prolongation of 
the QTc interval. 
No apparent relationship between drug concentrations and changes of heart rate or QTc 
interval were found in healthy or in COPD patients. The suggestions of QTc increase associated 
with QVA149 noted above were not seen consistently across studies and safety datasets. Overall, the 
potential for QTc prolongation is not considered to be of concern. Please also refer to the safety section 
in this report. 
Decreases in serum potassium are a potential class effect of β2-adrenergic agonists. For COPD patients 
in  Study  A2203,  treatment  differences  for  serum  potassium  showed  a  trend  of  dose  response 
compared  to  placebo.  The  absolute  change  remained  within  0.2  mmol/L,  and  the  clinical  implications 
are presumed to be minor. 
β2adrenergic  agonists  are  known  to  have  the  potential  to  increase  blood  glucose.  In  Study  A2105  a 
small  effect  of  QVA149  was  observed  on  blood  glucose  when  compared  to  placebo,  the  maximum 
difference being 0.67 mmol/L. In Study A2203 with COPD patients mean levels showed little variation 
between screening, pre-dose and up to 4 hours post-dose on Day 1 or up to 4 hours post-dose on Day 
14.iHowever, a higher percentage of patients reported elevated blood glucose levels (greater than 9.99 
mmol/L) in the QVA149 600/100 μg treatment group than the other groups at all but one time point. 
Thus, QVA149 could have a potential to increase  blood glucose in a dose dependent manner. 
The possible pharmacodynamic drug interactions especially with respect to concomitant treatment with 
drugs acting on the cardiovascular system have been adequately addressed by the applicant. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  mechanisms  of  action  for  beta-2-receptor  agonists  and  for  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  in 
obstructive  airway  disease  are  well  established.  As  bronchodilator  effects  are  related  to  topical  drug 
disposition in the lung, a clinically meaningful association between plasma concentration and effects is 
unlikely. 
Dose-proportionality  of  the  monotherapy  products  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium  has  been 
established. Dose proportionality for single dose of QVA149 with respect to Cmax, systemic exposure 
has been sufficiently demonstrated in healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects and seems to be in line 
with previous findings of the monotherapy products. 
No dedicated dose-response studies were performed. However, study 2204, a 7-day efficacy study to 
assess trough FEV1 as a primary endpoint, which  was not a dose-ranging study, but was intended to 
evaluate  the  benefit  of  a  combination  product  (QVA149  300/50  μg)  versus  two  doses  of  indacaterol 
monotherapy  (QAB149  300  μg  and  600  μg),  demonstrated  that  QVA149  300/50  μg  resulted  in  an 
increase  in  both  FEV1  and  FVC  immediately  following  inhalation  with  values  significantly  greater  than 
placebo and the two QAB149 doses up to and including 24 hours post dose after one and seven days of 
treatment.  QVA149  300/50  μg  treatment  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  and  to 
QAB149 300 μg and 600 μg monotherapy treatments in regards to trough FEV1 on Day 7, the primary 
endpoint. Results were similar for Day 1. FEV1 AUC was found to be statistically significantly greater in 
patients treated with QVA149 300/50 μg than in patients treated with placebo or QAB149 300 μg and 
600 μg on Day 1 and Day 7. Superiority of QVA149 300/50 μg compared with placebo and QAB149 of 
300 μg and 600 μg was demonstrated.

Secondary  efficacy  results  from  Study  A2203,  which  investigated  QVA149  600/100  μg,  300/100  μg, 
150/100  μg,  QAB149  300  μg  and  placebo  on  24  hour  heart  rate  at  day  14,  may  support  the  dose 
rationale. Study A2203 showed that the LS mean trough FEV1 values on Day 14 were 1.61, 1.52, 1.50, 
1.46  and  1.31  L  for  QVA149  600/100  μg,  300/100  μg,  150/100  μg,  QAB149  300  μg  and  placebo, 
respectively.  The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  inhalation  of  QVA149  at  600/100  μg,  300/100  μg 
and  150/100  μg  resulted  in  an  increase  in  both  FEV1  and  FVC  immediately  following  inhalation,  with 
values significantly greater than placebo up to and including 24 hours post dose after one day and 14 
days of treatment. It is reassuring that QVA149 doses 300/100 μg and 150/100 μg yielded the same 
trough FEV1, suggesting that a higher dose of indacaterol would not result in higher efficacy. 
The  CHMP  questioned  whether  a  lower  dose  of  indacaterol,  i.e.  75  μg,  would  have  been  equally 
efficacious.  There  are  indications  from  a  study  with  indacaterol  that  the  75  μg  dose  of  indacaterol 
yields  similar  efficacy  compared  to  150  μg.  Further,  a  study  with  glycopyrronium  suggested  that  a 
twice-daily regimen (25 µg BID) exhibits better efficacy than the proposed once-daily regimen (50 µg 
OD).  While  the  pursued  dose  regimen  is  considered  to  be  efficacious  as  outlined  in  this  assessment 
report,  a  BID  regimen  with  lower  doses  at  each  dosing  occasion  may  have  been  equally  or  more 
efficacious with a better safety and tolerability profile. 
In  light  of  the  above,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  further  justify  the  selected  doses  of  each  the 
components  and  the  once-daily  dose  regimen,  including  a  rationale  as  to  why  a  BID  regimen  with 
lower  doses  at  each  dosing  occasion  was  not  pursued.  The  Applicant  provided  an  assessment  of  the 
individual components of QVA149 regarding the selected doses of QAB149 and NVA237. 
Several  dose  finding  studies  have  shown  that  indacaterol  150  µg  provides  additional  benefit  in  the 
symptomatic  scores  TDI  and  SGRQ  as  well  as  on  the  24-hour  serial  spirometry  compared  to 
indacaterol  75  µg.  The  study  QAB149B2356  where  75  µg  and  150  µg  indacaterol  were  compared, 
trough  FEV1  treatment  difference  compared  to  placebo  was  slightly  better  with  indacaterol  150  µg 
(0.12  vs  0.10  ml).  It  was  agreed  that  the  indacaterol  150  µg  provided  additional  benefit  on 
symptomatic endpoints. Although not powered to detect a difference, it seems that indacaterol 150 µg 
provides better effect on symptomatic endpoints.  
The BID dosing regimen with NVA237 is currently being investigated. Therefore no results of the BID 
dosing  regimen  are  available.  Overall,  the  Applicant’s  response  was  considered  acceptable  to  address 
the dose-finding topic. 
It  has  been  confirmed  that  QVA149  has  an  additive  effect  when  compared  to  its  monotherapy 
components.  QVA149  110/50  μg  was  found  superior  to  both  QAB149  150  μg  and  NVA237  50  μg  in 
terms of trough FEV1 following 26 weeks of treatment. The effect of QVA149 remained constant over 
the  full  treatment  period  of  26  weeks  and  there  was  no  signal  for  tachyphylaxis  with  QVA149  over 
time. 
In  healthy  volunteers,  a  tachycardic  potential  of  QVA149  was  found  when  compared  to 
glycopyrronium,  thus  the  heart  rate  increased  statistically  significantly  by  5.20  bpm  at  1h  10m  post 
dose.  This  is  in  line  with  the  QVA149  vs.  placebo-results  and  indicates  that  indacaterol  could  be  the 
part of the fixed drug combination mainly responsible for the increase in heart rate. However, in COPD 
patients the mean 24-hour heart rate and mean change from baseline in 24 hour heart rate on Day 14 
showed no statistical difference between QVA149 treatment groups and placebo. 
No  thorough  QT/QTc  study  was  performed  by  the  Applicant.  However,  the  cardiac  effect  of  QVA149, 
QTcF was analyzed as a secondary PD-parameter. For COPD patients no QTcF changes > 60 ms were 
observed  across  any  of  the  treatment  groups  in  the  study.  However,  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
changes in QTcF in the range 30-60 ms in the QVA149 600/100 μg, 300/100 μg, 150/100 μg, QAB149 
300 μg and placebo were 20.4%, 21.6 %, 16.0 %, 19.6 % and 1.9%, respectively. QTc-prolongations

above  450  ms  were  more  frequently  recorded  in  the  QVA149  600/100  μg  treatment  group  (12.2%) 
versus  5.7%  in  the  placebo  group.  Thus,  data  suggest  that  there  could  be  a  positive  correlation 
between  a  high  dose  of  QVA149  and  prolongation  of  the  QTc  interval.  No  apparent  relationship 
between  drug  concentrations  and  changes  of  heart  rate  or  QTc  interval  were  found  in  healthy  or  in 
COPD  patients  therefore  the  initial  findings  are  not  considered  of  concern;  information  based  on  the 
available data is included in the SmPC. 
The  absolute  decreases  in  serum  potassium  remained  within  0.2  mmol/L,  and  thus,  the  clinical 
implications are presumed to be minor. 
A  small  effect  of  QVA149  was  observed  on  blood  glucose  when  compared  to  placebo,  the  maximum 
difference  being  0.67  mmol/L.  However,  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  reported  elevated  blood 
glucose levels (greater than 9.99 mmol/L) in the QVA149 600/100 μg treatment group than the other 
groups.  Thus,  QVA149  could  have  a  potential  to  increase  and  blood  glucose  in  a  dose  dependent 
manner. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of QVA149 have been sufficiently investigated. Relevant 
information  is  included  in  the  SmPC.  There  are  no  outstanding  issues  from  a  clinical  pharmacology 
point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies  
The  QVA149  110/50  μg  (i.e.  110  μg  QAB149/50  μg  NVA237)  dose  is  based  on  the  monotherapy 
components from their respective development programs, which identified QAB149 150 μg and 300 μg 
once daily and NVA237 50 μg once daily as safe and effective. 
Several  dose  finding  studies  have  shown  that  indacaterol  150  µg  provides  additional  benefit  in  the 
symptomatic  scores  TDI  and  SGRQ  as  well  as  on  the  24-hour  serial  spirometry  compared  to 
indacaterol  75  µg.  The  study  QAB149B2356  where  75  µg  and  150  µg  indacaterol  were  compared, 
trough  FEV1  treatment  difference  compared  to  placebo  was  slightly  better  with  indacaterol  150  µg 
(0.12  vs  0.10  ml).  It  was  agreed  that  the  indacaterol  150  µg  provided  additional  benefit  on 
symptomatic endpoints. Although not powered to detect a difference, it seems that indacaterol 150 µg 
provides better effect on symptomatic endpoints.  
The BID dosing regimen with NVA237 is currently being investigated. Therefore no results of the BID 
dosing  regimen  are  available.  Overall,  the  Applicant’s  response  was  considered  acceptable  to  address 
the dose-finding topic.

Study  A2304:  A  64-week,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  active  controlled 
evaluation of the effect of QVA149 (110/50 μg q.d.) compared to NVA237 (50 μg q.d.) and open-label 
tiotropium  (18  μg  q.d.)  on  COPD  exacerbations  in  patients  with  severe  to  very  severe  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
First,  the  two  studies  supporting  the  symptom  relief  claim  are  presented  (A2303  and  A2313). 
Subsequently, the study supporting the exacerbation claim is presented (A2304). 
Studies A2303 and A2313  
Methods 
The  methods  for  the  two  studies  are  discussed  jointly  as  most  methods  were  similar  for  the  two 
studies.  The  results  are  discussed  separately  for  the  two  studies.  Both  studies  were  designed  as 
superiority studies and non-linear fixed modeling was used.  
Study Participants  
The two pivotal studies had similar in- and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients were adult symptomatic 
males  and  females  age  ≥40  years  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  stable  moderate  to  severe  COPD 
(diagnosed according to the GOLD guidelines 2008) and a smoking history (current or ex-smokers) of 
at  least  10  years.  Patients  performed  reversibility  tests  with  a  short-acting  anti-cholinergic 
(ipratropium  bromide)  and  short-acting  β-2-agonist  (salbutamol)  prior  to  randomization  (at  Visit  2), 
and to be included the patients were to have a FEV1 ≥40% and <80% of the predicted normal, and a 
post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. 
Treatments 
Both  studies  were  international,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  studies  with  a 
duration  of  26  weeks  preceded  by  a  two  weeks  screening  period  and  prior  to  this  a  one-week  pre-
screening period.  
Study A2303 was placebo and active controlled (open label) whereas Study A2313 was designed as a 
double-dummy active controlled trial.  
Study design is shown in Figure 1 and 2. During the 26 weeks of treatment with study-medication the 
patients were seen at planned visits and spirometry was performed at every visit starting at Visit 3. In 
both studies, patients were followed up for 30 days after last dose of study medication.  
Study medication for Study A2303: Eligible patients fulfilling predefined in- and exclusion criteria were 
randomised (randomisation ratio: 2:2:2:2:1) to treatment with either:  
- Investigational Therapy for Study A2303: QVA149 (110 μg QAB149/50 μg NVA237), capsules for oral 
inhalation once daily delivered via a single-dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) OR

- Reference Therapy for Study A2303:  
QAB149 (indacaterol maleate) 150 μg q.d., capsules for oral inhalation, delivered via a SDDPI, OR 
NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide) 50 μg q.d., capsules for oral inhalation, delivered via a SDDPI, OR 
Tiotropium 18 μg q.d, open-label, oral inhalation, delivered via a HandiHaler, OR 
Placebo q.d., for oral inhalation, delivered via a SDDPI 
Study medication for Study A2313: Eligible patients fulfilling predefined in- and exclusion criteria were 
randomised (randomisation ratio: 1:1) to treatment with either:  
Investigational Therapy for Study A2313: QVA149 (110 μg QAB149/50 μg NVA237), capsules for oral 
inhalation, once daily, delivered via a single-dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) OR 
Reference  Therapy  for  Study  A2313:  Fluticasone  500  μg/salmeterol  50  μg  dry  inhalation  powder 
delivered via Accuhaler device. 
Since this was a double-dummy study, patients received medication kits consisting of either: 
Active QVA149 with SDDPI device and placebo fluticasone/salmeterol with Accuhaler device OR 
Placebo QVA149 with SDDPI and active fluticasone/salmeterol with Accuhaler device. 
In  both  studies,  rescue  medication  was  inhalations  of  salbutamol/albuterol  and  all  patients  were 
provided  this  at  Visit  1  and  were  instructed  to  use  it  throughout  the  study  as  rescue  medication. 
Patients were instructed to abstain from taking rescue salbutamol within six hours of the start of each 
visit  unless  absolutely  necessary.  Rescue  medication  usage  was  collected  twice  daily  in  the  eDiary 
between study visits. 
In  both  studies,  the  patients  were  informed  that  no  adjustments  to  study  drug  dosage  or  schedule 
were permitted, other than temporarily interrupting study drug during the treatment period as a result 
of an AE (including mild COPD exacerbations), if necessary. In Study A2313, patients who experienced 
a  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbation  should  be discontinued  from  study  medication  and  the trial 
immediately.

Objectives 
Primary objectives 
The  primary  objective  for  Study  A2303  was  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  QVA  110/50  μg  q.d. 
compared  to  the  mono-components  QAB149  150  μg  and  NVA237  50  μg  in  terms  of  trough  FEV1 
following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD. 
The primary objective for Study A2313 was to demonstrate the superiority of QVA149 110/50 μg q.d. 
as compared to fluticasone/salmeterol (500 μg /50 μg) b.i.d. in terms of standardised FEV1 AUC0-12h 
following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  outcome  measure  for  Study  A2303  was  trough  FEV1  (imputed  with  LOCF)  after  26 
weeks of treatment. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the post-dose 23 h 15 min and the 23 h 
45  min  FEV1  values  at  Visit  13.  All  spirometry  measurements  were  performed  using  centralised 
spirometry. 
The  primary  outcome  measure  for  Study  A2313  was  standardised  FEV1  AUC0-12h  following  26 
weeks  of  treatment  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  COPD.  All  spirometry  measurements  were 
performed using centralised spirometry. 
Secondary  outcome  measures  for  Study  A2303  and  A2313  were  almost  identical  and  included 
the following parameters described below:  
Forced  Expiratory  Volume  in  one  second  (FEV1)  Forced  Vital  Capacity  (FVC)  and  Inspiratory  Capacity 
(IC): All spirometry measurements were performed using centralised spirometry. 
Transitional  Dyspnea  Index  (TDI):  Patients  were  interviewed  by  a  trained  assessor  who  graded  the 
degree of  impairment  due  to  dyspnea  at  Visit  3  (baseline  dyspnea  index),  at  the  planned  visits  or  at 
the  time  of  discontinuation  for  patients  who  withdrew  prematurely.  The  same  assessor  completed  all 
the BDI/TDI assessments for individual patient.  
A 1-unit change in TDI focal score was considered to be the minimal clinically important improvement 
from baseline (MCID) (Witek & Mahler 2003, Summary of Clin. Efficacy). 
St.  George’s  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  version)  (SGRQ-C): 
SGRQ-C  was  used  to  provide  a  score  on  the  health  related  quality  of  life.  The  SGRQ-C  was  self-
administered on paper by the patient at the investigator's site at baseline (Visit 3) at the planned visits 
or  at  the  time  of  discontinuation  for  patients  who  withdrew  prematurely.  The  appropriate  language 
version(s)  of  the  questionnaires  was  used  in  each  participating  country.  The  investigator  transcribed 
the  answers  given  by  the patients into the  eCRFs  including  a  translation  into English  of  any  free  text 
recorded by the patient. 
A  minus-4-units  change  in  SGRQ  was  considered  to  be  the  MCID  (Jones  2002,  Summary  of  Clin 
Efficacy). 
Rescue  medication:  Patients  were  asked  to  twice  daily  (morning  and  evening)  record  use  of  rescue 
medication (salbutamol/albuterol). The data was collected via the eDiary.   
Symptoms of COPD and rate of occurrence of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations: Symptoms of 
COPD  were  assessed  using  data  collected  via  the  eDiary  which  was  completed  by  the  patients  twice 
daily  (morning  and  evening).  The  patients  were  to  record  the  following  clinical  symptoms:  cough, 
wheezing, shortness of breath, sputum volume, sputum purulence and night time awakenings. 
Secondary  outcome  measures  also  included  safety  and  tolerability  which  will  be  presented  and 
evaluated in the safety part of the Assessment Report.  
Sample size 
Sample  size  for  Study  A2303:  Sample  size  was  calculated  based  on  a  2:2:2:2:1  randomisation 
with  pre-defined  delta-values  based  on  earlier  QAB149  studies.  The  three  key  secondary  endpoints 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 45/99 
 
  
were also adequately powered.  
Sample  size  for  Study  A2313:  To  detect  statistical  significance  in  the  primary  endpoint  (at 
alpha=0.05, with 80% power) for a treatment arm differential of 60 mL in FEV1 AUC0-12h at Week 26 
(with conservatively assumed standard deviation of 225 mL), and assuming a 15% dropout rate, an 
estimated total  sample  size  of  522  patients  (261 per  arm)  would  be  needed  to  be  randomised  (444 
completers). 
Randomisation 
The randomisation procedure was the same for both pivotal studies (A2303 and A2313). At Visit 3, all 
eligible  patients  were  randomised  via  Interactive  Response  Technology  to  one  of  the  treatment  arms 
(see study medication). In both studies, treatment randomisation was maintained and stratified at the 
regional  and/or  country  level,  not  center  level.  In  both  studies,  randomisation  was  also  stratified  by 
smoking  status  (current  or  ex-smoker),  which  is  in  line  with  the  current  CHMP  guideline.  In  both 
studies  the  randomisation  scheme  for  patients  was  reviewed  and  approved  by  a  member  of  the 
Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  blinding  procedure  was  identical  in  the  two  studies  (A2303  and  A2313):  Patients,  investigator 
staff,  persons  performing  the  assessments,  and  data  analysts  remained  blind  to  the  identity  of  the 
treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock. 
In  Study  A2303  treatment  with  tiotropium  was  open-label  as  discussed  earlier.  In  Study  A2313  a 
double-dummy design was used because the identity of the study drugs could not be disguised due to 
their different forms. 
Statistical methods 
In both studies, the study population was defined as follows:  
(1) The randomised set (RAN) included all randomised patients. Patients were analysed according to 
the treatment they were randomised to. 
(2)  The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  included  all  randomised  patients,  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
study medication. Patients were analysed according to the treatment they were randomised to.  
(3) The safety set included all patients, who received at least one dose of study medication whether 
or  not  being  randomised.  Patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  treatment  they  received  (if 
patients switched treatment during the study, they  were analysed according to the treatment they 
were randomised to). 
(4)  The  per-protocol  set  (PPS)  included  all  patients  in  the  FAS  population  without  major  protocol 
deviations  or  other  criteria  which  caused  exclusion  from  an  analysis  set.  Patients  were  analysed 
according to the treatment they were randomised to. 
In both studies, the FAS was used to analyse all efficacy endpoints (unless otherwise stated). 
For A2303:  
The primary variable was trough FEV1 (imputed with last observation carried forward, LOCF) after 26 
weeks of treatment. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the post-dose 23 h 15 min and the 23 h 45 
min FEV1 values at Visit 13.

The  superiority  contrasts  (QVA149  vs.  QAB149  and  QVA149  vs.  NVA237)  were  evaluated  by  testing 
several null hypothesis versus the alternative hypothesis. 
For A2313: 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  standardised  AUC0-12h  for  FEV1  after  26  weeks  of  treatment. 
Standardised  AUC  0-12h  for  FEV1  (and  FVC)  on  Day  1  and  after  12  and  26  weeks  of  treatment  was 
calculated using the trapezoidal rule and standardised with respect to length of time from the first (5 
min)  to  the  last  measurement  (12  hour).  Secondary  efficacy  variables  were  for  AUC0-12h  for  FEV1 
analysed using the same model as the primary analysis. 
The  superiority  of  QVA149  (110/50  μg  q.d.)  over  fluticasone/salmeterol  (500 μg/50  μg)  (=  FLU/SAL) 
was evaluated by testing several null hypothesis versus the alternative hypothesis. 
 In  both  studies,  handling  of  missing  data  was  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  protocol.  ‘Last 
Observation  Carried  Forward’  (LOCF)  was  used  to  impute  the  missing data. Both  protocols  define  the 
time-frame for which the spirometric investigations should be carried out to be correctly representative 
for the time of investigation.  
Results (Study A2303) 
Participant flow and numbers analysed 
A  total  of  3625  patients  were  screened  and  2144  patients  were  randomised;  475  patients  were 
randomised to treatment with QVA149, 477 patients were randomised to treatment with QAB149, 475 
patients were randomised to treatment with NVA237, 483 patients were randomised to treatment with 
tiotropium  and  234  patients  were  randomised  to  treatment  with  placebo.  The  most  common  reasons 
for  screening  failure  were  that  screened  patients  did  not  meet  diagnostic/severity  criteria  (429 
[29.0%] patients) or due to unacceptable test procedure result(s) (410 [27.7%] patients).  
A total of 89.1% (1910 patients) of all randomised patients completed the study: 92% (437 patients) 
randomised  to  QVA149,  88.3%  (421  patients)  randomised  to  QAB149,  88.8%  (422  patients) 
randomised  to  NVA237,  91.3%  (441  patients)  randomised  to  tiotropium  and  80.8%  (189  patients) 
randomised to placebo. More patients in the placebo group discontinued the study (19.2%), which was 
mostly due  to  withdrawal of  consent  (5.6%)  and  AE(s)  (4.3%).  The  latter  can  partly be  attributed  to 
unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  as  COPD  more  often  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  the  placebo  group  as 
compared  to  the  other  groups.  Also  more  patients  (4.8%)  in  the  QAB149  group  discontinued  the 
treatment  due  to  AE(s)  compared  to  the  other  active  treatment  groups  (1.1%  -  2.7%).  Overall,  the 
most  common  reasons  for  study  discontinuation  were  withdrawal  of  consent,  AEs  and  protocol 
deviations. 
The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  the  safety  analysis  set  (SAF)were  identical  and  consisted  of  2135  
(99.6%)  patients  as  nine  randomised  patients  did  not  receive  any  study  medication.  A  total  of  1839 
patients (85.8%) were included in the per protocol analysis (PPS). 
Recruitment 
Study A2303 was conducted 21.09.2010 – 10.02.2012 (first patient first visit – last patient last visit). 
Patients  were  recruited  from  301  study  centers  distributed  in  11  European  countries  as  well  as  from 
countries in Africa, North– and South- America, Asia and Australia.

Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  for  Study  A2303  was  amended  twice.  There  were  no  other  changes  in  the  study 
conduct, and the study was completed as planned.  
The  study  protocol  and  all  amendments  were  reviewed  by  the  Independent  Ethics  Committee  or 
Institutional Review Board for each center. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study sites were monitored before study initiation as well as during the 
study by Novartis personnel with focus on adherence to the protocol and to GCP as well as compliance 
with global and local regulatory requirements. 
Baseline data 
Overall the treatment groups were well balanced for demographic and baseline characteristics. In all 
treatment  groups  66–70%  were  Caucasian  and  in  all  groups  most  patients  were  men  (72–77%). 
Mean  age  was  64  years  for  all  patients,  and  a  comparable  amount  of  the  randomised  patients  were 
elderly  defined  as  ≥65  years  of  age:  from  45.4%  in  the  tiotropium  group  to  52.6%  in  the  placebo-
group. 
Disease  history  and  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  treatment  groups. 
Overall,  the  mean  duration  of  COPD  was  6.3  years,  with  a  range  of  0  to  36  years.  A  smaller 
proportion of patients with a COPD duration >20 years was seen in the QVA149 group (1.7%) in the 
QVA149 group compared to the other groups (3.1–4.2%). In all treatment groups most patients had 
moderate  COPD  (mean  for  all  patients  was  63.6%,  and  in  the  five  treatment  groups  the  mean  was 
61.7–67.7%).  Also  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  were  ex-smokers  (mean  60.3%)  compared  to 
current  smokers  (mean  39.7%).  Smoking  history  in  terms  of  mean  number  of  pack  years  for  all 
patients was 44.9 pack years. Overall, 74.6% of the patients had no history of COPD exacerbation in 
the year prior to enrollment (from 73.1% in the QVA149 group to 79.3% in the placebo group). 
Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was similar for all treatment groups: 1.3 L (≈47% of predicted FEV1). 
Likewise also post-bronchodilator FEV1 was comparable for all treatment groups; overall mean post-
bronchodilator  FEV1  was  1.5  L  (≈55%  of  predicted  FEV1).  Mean  FEV1  reversibility  (%)  post-
bronchodilator was 20.3% for all patients with no meaningful difference between treatment-groups. 
Most  patients  (84.5%)  had  a  medical  history  that  included  at  least  one  relevant  co-morbid 
disease/condition and overall the most commonly affected system organ classes (SOC) were vascular 
disorders. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The primary objective of Study A2303 was to demonstrate the superiority of the FDC QVA149 110/50 
μg compared to the mono-components QAB149 150 μg and NVA237 50 μg in terms of trough FEV1 
following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD. 
Treatment  group  comparisons  of  trough  FEV1  after  26  weeks  (LOCF)  of  treatment  are  presented  in 
Table 2.

Table 2: Trough FEV1 (L) at Week 26 (imputed with LOCF): treatment comparisons for 
superiority (FAS and PPS), Study A2303 
As  per  the  primary  objective,  QVA149  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  compared  to 
both mono-components. A Least Square (LS) mean treatment difference of 70 mL was achieved when 
QVA149  was  compared  to  QAB149  and  a  LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  90  mL  was  achieved 
compared to NVA237 (p<0.001 for both treatment comparisons).  
For all comparisons, results for the PPS supported those of the FAS (Table 2).

Supportive analyses for the primary endpoint 
Post-hoc supportive analyses for the primary endpoint showed that the proportion of patients with an 
increase of 100 mL in trough FEV1 at Week 26 (LOCF) from baseline was greater for QVA149 (64.3%) 
compared to QAB149 (46.2%), NVA237 (43.2%), tiotropium (46.6%) and placebo (18.9%), (p<0.001 
for all treatment comparisons).  
A post-hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with an increase of 200 mL in trough FEV1 at Week 26 
(LOCF)  from  baseline  was  greater  for  QVA149  (39.8%)  compared  to  QAB149  (26.2%),  NVA237 
(23.8%), tiotropium (25.1%) and placebo (8.4%), (p<0.001 for all treatment comparisons). 
At Week 26 (with LOCF), all active treatments had an increase in through FEV1 from baseline, with the 
mean increase being highest for the QVA149 group (160 mL, equal to 15.3% from baseline). The mean 
change from baseline for QAB149 was 80 mL (equal to 7.7% from baseline); for NVA237 was 70 mL, 
(equal to 7.1% from baseline) and for tiotropium 90 mL (equal to 9.3% from baseline). Results for the 
PPS supported those of the FAS. 
Key secondary objectives for Study A2303 were to demonstrate the superiority of QVA149 110/50 
μg  compared  to  placebo  following  26  weeks  of treatment  in terms of  the  patient’s  disease  symptoms 
including  the  level  of  breathlessness  experienced  by  the  patients  evaluated  by  using  the  TDI,  the 
health related quality of life evaluated by using the using the SGRQ and use of rescue medication used 
(number of puffs) by 26 weeks. 
TDI: 
For the QVA149 treatment group, improvement in TDI focal score vs. placebo at Week 26 (LOCF) was 
statistically  significant  with  a  LS  mean  difference  of  1.09  points  (p<0.001).  Likewise,  at  Week  26 
(LOCF),  a  statistically  significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  QVA149  (68.1%) 
responded  with  a  pre-defined  clinically  meaningful  improvement  (≥1  point)  in  the  TDI  focal  score 
compared with placebo (57.5%), odds ratio 1.86 (p=0.004).  
TDI focal score at Week 26 (LOCF) was numerically greater but not statistically significant for QVA149 
with a LS mean difference of 0.26 compared to QAB149 (p=0.175) and 0.21 and compared to NVA237 
(p=0.283). Compared to tiotropium, QVA149 showed a statistically significant improvement with a LS 
mean  difference  0.51  (p  =  0.007).  Clinically  important  improvement  (≥1  point)  was  also  seen  in  a 
higher  proportion  of  patients  at  Week  26  in  the  QVA149  group  as  compared  to  QAB149  group  (odds 
ratio  1.13,  p=0.458)  and NVA237  group  (odds  ratio  1.12,  p=0.489)  and  tiotropium  (odds  ratio  1.51, 
p=0.0016). 
SGRQ: 
At  Week  26  (LOCF),  improvement  in  health  status,  as  indicated  by  a  reduction  in  SGRQ  total  score, 
was  statistically  significantly  greater  in  the  QVA149  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  LS  mean 
difference  was  -3.01  (p=0.002).  At  the  same  time  point,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  clinically 
meaningful improvement in the SGRQ total score (≥4 point reduction) was higher in the QVA149 group 
(63.7%) compared with the placebo group (56.6%), with an odds ratio of 1.39. However the difference 
did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.088).  
For  the  QAB149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium  groups  at  Week  26  (LOCF)  SGRQ  total  scores  were 
numerically  better  than  placebo  with  LS  mean  differences  of  -1.92,  -1.83  and  -0.88  respectively,  but 
none of these treatment differences were statistically significant.  
Rescue medication: 
Patients  in  the  QVA149  group  required  significantly less  rescue  medication  compared  with  patients in 
the  placebo  group  (LS  mean  difference  -0.96  puffs/day,  p<0.001).  In  the  QVA149  group,  patients 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 50/99 
 
  
required  a  reduced  amount  of  rescue  medication  compared  to  patients  in  QAB149  (treatment 
difference: -0.30 puffs/day, p=0.027), NVA237 (treatment difference: -0.66 puffs/day, p<0.001) and 
tiotropium (LS mean difference -0.54 puffs/day, p <0.001). 
The  percentage  of  days  with  no  rescue  medication  use  over  the  26-week  treatment  period  was 
statistically  significantly  greater  in  the  QVA149  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (LS  mean  treatment 
difference = 12.33, p<0.001). 
Important secondary objectives included assessment of superiority of QVA149 110/50 μg, NVA237 
50 μg and QAB149 150 μg compared to placebo in terms of lung function at trough FEV1 following 26 
weeks  of  treatment  and  assessment  of  whether  QVA149  110/50  μg  is  at  least  as  effective  as  open 
label tiotropium 18 μg in terms of lung function at trough FEV1 following 26 weeks of treatment.  
QVA149 compared to placebo in terms of lung function at trough FEV1 following 26 weeks of treatment 
demonstrated a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference of 200 mL (p<0.001). Comparing 
QAB149  to  placebo  resulted  in  a  LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  130  mL  (p<0.001)  and  comparing 
NVA237  to  placebo  resulted  in  a  LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  120  mL  (p<0.001).  Tiotropium 
compared to placebo resulted in a similar LS mean treatment difference of 130 mL (p<0.001). 
As  per  the  statistical  gate  keeping  procedure,  QVA149  demonstrated  statistically  significant 
improvement in  trough  FEV1 compared to tiotropium,  with  a  LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  80  mL, 
and  when  compared  to  placebo  with  a  LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  200  mL  (p<0.001  for  both 
comparisons).  
Results for ‘Other secondary objectives’ supported the results from the primary endpoint and the key- 
and  important  secondary  objectives.  For  the  outcomes  of  TDI  and  SGRQ,  QVA149  was  statistically 
significant better than placebo and tiotropium Numerical improvements were seen for QVA149 vs. the 
monotherapy  components  QAB149  and  NVA237.  Patients  treated  with  QVA149  required  statistically 
significant less rescue medication compared with patients treated with placebo and tiotropium.  
Ancillary analyses 
Ancillary analyses included post hoc subgroup analyses of primary efficacy endpoint. Post-hoc analyses 
of LS Mean Difference after 26 weeks of treatment were performed for the following subgroups:  
•  Age (< 65, 65 to <75, ≥75 years)  
•  Gender (male and female) 
•  Race (Caucasians, Asians, Blacks and ‘other races’) 
•  Smoking status (current smokers and ex-smokers ) 
•  COPD disease severity (moderate disease and severe disease) 
•  Baseline ICS use (use and no use of ICS at baseline) 
• 
• 
FEV1  reversibility  (reversibility  ≤5%  increase,  reversibility  >5%  and  ≤12%  increase  and 
reversibility >12% increase) 
FEV1 median reversibility (above and below the median FEV1 reversibility of 18% at screening) 
Overall,  the  subgroup  analyses  supported  the  primary  analysis.  Most  notably  was  a  tendency  to  a 
better effect of QVA149 in patients with a reversibility >5% as compared to a reversibility ≤5%. This 
result was confirmed with a higher LS mean difference in patients with a FEV1 reversibility above the 
median  18%  at  screening  compared  to  patients  with  a  reversibility  under  the  median  18%  at 
screening.

In  other  subgroup  analyses  no  meaningful  difference  in  LS  mean  difference  between  subgroups  were 
found,  especially  no  difference  in  the  age-groups  was  seen.  There  was  a  slight  tendency  to  better 
effect  of  QVA149  in  women  compared  to  men  with  a  difference  of  20  mL  in  the  LS  mean  difference 
when  QVA149  was  compared  to  QAB149,  NVA237  and  placebo.  When  compared  to  tiotropium  there 
was a slightly better effect in male. Overall these numbers are considered too small and with no clinical 
importance.      
Results (Study A2313) 
Participant flow and numbers analysed 
A  total  of  832  patients  were  screened  and  523  patients  were  randomised;  259  patients  were 
randomised to treatment with QVA149 and 264 patients were randomised to treatment with FLU/SAL. 
The most common reason for screening failure was ‘unacceptable test procedure results’ 131 (15.7%) 
patients.  
83.0%  (215  patients)  randomised  to  QVA149  and  82.2%  (217  patients)  randomised  to  FLU/SAL 
completed the study. 
The full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analysis set were identical and both consisted of 522 patients 
as  one  patient  randomised  to  treatment  with  QVA149  was  withdrawn  as  there  were  neither  COPD 
symptoms reported during the run-in period nor did the patient receive any study medication.  
A total of 485 patients (92.7%) were included in the per protocol analysis (PPS), of these 237 patients 
were randomised to QVA149 and 248 patients were randomised to FLU/SAL. 
Recruitment 
Study A2313 was conducted 25.03.2011 – 12.03.2012 (first patient first visit – last patient last visit). 
Patients  were  recruited  from  86  study  centers  distributed  in  nine  European  countries  (79  study 
centers) and Korea.  
Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  for  Study  A2313  was  amended  once.  There  were  no  other  changes  in  the  study 
conduct, and the study was completed as planned. 
The  study  protocol  and  the  amendment  were  reviewed  by  the  Independent  Ethics  Committee  or 
Institutional Review Board for each center. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study sites were monitored before study initiation as well as during the 
study by Novartis personnel with focus on adherence to the protocol and to GCP as well as compliance 
with global and local regulatory requirements.  
Baseline data 
Overall  the  two  groups  were  well  balanced  for  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics.  In  both 
groups  89%  were  Caucasian  and  in  both  treatment  groups  most  patients  were  men  (70.2  %  in 
QVA149 and 71.6% in FLU/SAL). In both treatment groups mean age was 63 years and a comparable 
amount of the randomised patients were elderly defined as ≥65 years of age: 43.8% in the QVA149-
group and 43.2% in the FLU/SAL-group. Only 7-8% of the patients were ≥75 years of age. BMI was 
identical in the two groups with mean BMI of 27 kg/m2. 
Disease history and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between treatment groups. In

both treatment groups 80% had moderate COPD and 20% had severe COPD and in both groups 48% 
were  current  smokers.  The  mean  number  of  pack  years  for  all patients  were 40  pack  years  with  no 
difference  between  study  groups.  All  patients  but  one  (randomised  to  FLU/SAL)  had  no  history  of 
COPD exacerbation in the year prior to enrollment.  
Overall, mean duration of COPD was 7.0 years, with a range of 0 to 38 years. Mean duration of COPD 
was slightly higher for the FLU/SAL group (7.5  years versus 6.4 years in the  QVA149 group) with a 
higher proportion of patients with a COPD duration >10 years (27.6% versus 19.4% in the QVA149 
group).  There  was  a  tendency  towards  more  patients  in  the  QVA149  group  were  using  ICS  (67.1% 
vs. 62.9%). 
Mean  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  was  similar;  1.5  L  (≈mean  51.1%  of  predicted)  and  1.4  L  (≈mean 
50.7%  of  predicted)  in  the  QVA149-group  and  the  FLU/SAL-group  respectively.  Likewise  also  post-
bronchodilator  FEV1  was  similar;  1.7  L  in  both  treatment  groups  (mean:  60.5%  and  60.0%  of 
predicted in the QVA149-group and the FLU/SAL-group respectively). Overall, mean FEV1 reversibility 
(%) post-bronchodilator was 20.4% with no difference between treatment-groups. 
More  patients  in  the  QVA149  treated  group  compared  to  the  FLU/SAL  treated  group  had  history  of 
cardiovascular  medical  conditions.  This  was  most  pronounced  for  peripheral  artery  disease  (7.4%  vs. 
3.8%  in  the  QVA149  and  the  FLU/SAL  group  respectively).  Likewise  a  higher  percentage  of  patients 
randomised  to  QVA149  had  hyperlipidemia  (30.2%  vs.  22.7%  in  the  QVA149  and  FLU/SAL  groups 
respectively),  whereas  more  patients  in  the  FLU/SAL  group  had  diabetes  (15.9%  vs.  12.8%  in  the 
FLU/SAL  and  QVA149  groups  respectively).  Overall  52.5%  had  hypertension  with  no  difference 
between treatment groups.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
The primary efficacy variable was the standardised AUC0-12h for FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment. The 
improvement in FEV1 AUC0-12h for the QVA149 group was statistically superior to the FLU/SAL group at 
each  visit  (p<0.001).  At  Week  26  the  difference  between  baseline  and  Week  26  for  QVA149  and 
FLU/SAL  in  LS  mean  improvement  was  1.69  L  vs.  1.56  L  respectively,  thus  the  LS  mean  treatment 
difference  was  140  mL  (p<0.001).  When  LOCF  was  applied,  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  was 
unchanged 140 mL (p<0.001).  
A sensitivity analysis of AUC0-12h for FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment using the PPS confirmed these 
results,  with  an  LS  mean improvement  at  Week 26  for  the  QVA149  group  of 1.69  L  compared  to  the 
FLU/SAL group of 1.55 L, thus the LS mean treatment difference was 140 mL (p<0.001).  
Secondary endpoints for Study A2313 
FEV1 at all time points at Week 12 and Week 26 
The  study  found  a  statistically  significant  (p<0.001  for  Week  12  and  Week  26)  LS  mean  treatment 
difference between QVA149 and FLU/SAL at all time points at Week 12 and Week 26. At Week 12 the 
LS  mean  treatment  difference  at  5  minutes,  30  minutes,  60  minutes  and  12 hours  was  130  mL,  160 
mL,  160  mL  and  130  mL  respectively.  At  26  Weeks,  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  was  150  mL, 
160 mL, 170 mL and 140 mL at the same time points.  
FVC over time at Week 12 and Week 26 
The  study  found  a  statistically  significant  (p<0.001  for  Week  12  and  Week  26)  LS  mean  treatment 
difference between QVA149 and FLU/SAL at all time points at Week 12 and Week 26. At Week 12 the 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 53/99 
 
 
 
  
LS  mean  treatment difference  at  5  minutes,  60  minutes  and  12  hours  was  240  mL,  230  mL  and  190 
mL respectively. At 26 Weeks, the LS mean treatment difference was 250 mL, 270 mL and 210 mL at 
the same time points.  
IC over time at Week 12 and Week 26 
IC  was  measured  for  a  subset  of  patients  (78  patients  [30.2%]  at  baseline  and  49-73  patients 
contributing  observations  at  post-baseline  visits  in  the  QVA149  group,  and  86  patients  [32.6%]  at 
baseline and 60-79 patients contributing observations at post-baseline visits in the FLU/SAL group). LS 
mean IC values were numerically greater for the QVA149 group compared with the FLU/SAL group for 
all time points at Week 12 and Week 26. The differences were not statistically significant, probably due 
to the small number of patients contributing observations. 
TDI 
For both treatment groups, both at Week 12 and Week 26 the LS mean change was >1, which was the 
predefined MCID in TDI focal score. The increases in TDI focal score for the QVA149 group compared 
to the FLU/SAL group at both Week 12 and Week 26 was statistically significant (p=0.025 at Week 12 
and p=0.003 at Week 26). At week 12 the LS mean treatment difference in TDI was 0.58, and at Week 
26 the LS mean treatment difference between QVA149 and FLU/SAL was 0.76. Neither of these results 
is  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  In  contrast  to  this  finding,  the  within  treatment  change 
compared to baseline  was  clinically  meaningful  for  both  treatment groups  (LS mean  difference  within 
the two treatment groups was 1.16 to 2.16). 
SGRQ 
At  Week  12  similar  reductions  in  SGRQ-C  were  seen  for  the  QVA149  and  FLU/SAL  groups  (LS  mean: 
36.64 and 35.97 for QVA149 and FLU/SAL respectively, thus at LS mean treatment difference of 0.67). 
At Week 26 the LS mean difference was 35.97 and 37.10 for QVA149 and FLU/SAL respectively, thus a 
LS  mean  treatment  difference  of  -1.13  when  comparing  QVA149  to  FLU/SAL.  The  results  were  not 
statistically significant (p=0.429 for Week 12 and p=0.272 for Week 26) and did not reach the MCID of 
minus-4-units.  
Mean change in use of rescue medication 
Rescue medication use in terms of mean daily number of puffs of albuterol/salbutamol was lower in the 
QVA149 group compared with the FLU/SAL group over the whole 26 week treatment period however, 
the  difference  is  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  LS  mean  treatment  difference  by  12  Weeks 
was  -0.28  (p=0.089)  and  by  26  weeks  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  was  -0.39  (p=0.019).  The 
percentage of days with no rescue medication use was numerically in favour  of QVA149 compared to 
FLU/SAL (51.25 vs. 46.53) although the treatment difference was not statistically significant (LS mean 
treatment difference 4.72, p=0.110). 
Symptoms recorded on patient eDiary; Daily, morning and evening symptom scores 
The change from baseline for the percentage ‘days able to perform usual daily activities’ was similar for 
the  QVA149  and  FLU/SAL groups  (9.6%  and  11.5%,  respectively),  and  the treatment  difference  over 
26 weeks was not statistically significant (LS mean treatment difference: -1.24, p=0.626). 
The  LS  mean  treatment  difference  (QVA149  –  FLU/SAL)  for  the  percentage  of  days  with  ‘no  daytime 
symptoms’  over  26  weeks  was  just  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  QVA149  (LS  mean  treatment 
difference:  2.50,  p=0.049).  The  change  from  baseline  for  the  percentage  of  days  with  ‘no  daytime 
symptoms’ for the QVA149 group was 5.8% compared to 5.1% for the FLU/SAL group. 
The increase from baseline for the percentage of nights with ‘no nighttime awakenings’ was similar for 
the QVA149 and FLU/SAL groups (13.2% and 15.9%, respectively), and the treatment difference over 
26 weeks was not statistically significant (LS mean treatment difference: -1.38, p=0.565).

No treatment difference was observed for change from baseline in the mean daily total symptom score 
(LS  mean  treatment  difference:  -0.05,  p=0.715).  Change  from  baseline  in  the  mean  daytime  total 
symptom  score  (LS  mean  -0.10,  p=0.435),  and  change  from  baseline  in  the  mean  nighttime  total 
symptom  score  (LS  mean  0.04,  p=0.772)  were  similar  for  both  treatment  groups.  Differences  were 
also  not  seen  for  individual  symptom  scores  except  for  breathlessness  scores,  which  were  all 
statistically significantly reduced in favour of the QVA149 group: LS mean change from baseline in the 
mean  daily  breathlessness  symptom  score  was  -0.09  (p=0.0008);  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
the  mean  daytime  breathlessness  symptom  score  was  -0.07  (p=0.021)  and  LS  mean  change  from 
baseline in the mean nighttime breathlessness symptom score was -0.08 (p=0.039). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
Post-hoc  analyses  of  FEV1  AUC0-12h  after  26  weeks  of  treatment  were  performed  for  the  following 
subgroups:  
•  Age (< 65 [n=268], 65 to <75 [n=168], ≥75 years [n=32])  
•  Gender (male [n=330] and female [n=138]) 
•  Smoking status (ex-smokers [n=236] and current smokers [n=232]) 
•  COPD disease severity (moderate disease [n=374] and severe disease [n=94]) 
•  FEV1 reversibility (reversibility ≤5% increase [n=56], reversibility >5% and ≤12% increase [n=104] 
and reversibility >12% increase [n=308]) 
Overall, subgroup analyses supported the primary analysis, finding a LS mean difference of 100-150 
mL when comparing the change from baseline after 26 weeks treatment with QVA149 to the change 
from  baseline  after  26  weeks  treatment  with  FLU/SAL.  There  was  a  tendency  towards  higher  LS 
mean  treatment  difference  for  patients  with  moderate  COPD  severity  compared  to  patients  with 
severe COPD however, the results for the patients with severe COPD was not statistically significant. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a  FEV1  reversibility  ≤5%,  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  was 
only 60 mL (p=0.249).

Study A2304 
Study  A2304  was  a  multi-center,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  active-controlled  (open-
label) study from 64 to 76 weeks to evaluate the effect of QVA149 110/50 μg o.d. versus NVA237 50 
μg  o.d.  and  OL  tiotropium  18  μg  o.d.  on  COPD  exacerbations  in  patients  with  severe  to  very  severe 
COPD. Superiority of QVA149 to NVA237 on exacerbations was the primary objective and superiority of 
QVA149 to open label (OL) tiotropium was a secondary objective.  
Methods 
Superiority  of  QVA149  to  NVA237  on  exacerbations  was  the  primary  objective  and  superiority  of 
QVA149 to open label (OL) tiotropium was a secondary objective. Analysis of  all exacerbations (mild, 
moderate  and  severe)  and  time  to  first  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbation  during  the  treatment 
period was two of several secondary objectives along with spirometry measurements (FEV1 and FVC), 
St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), electronic  patient diary to monitor patient symptoms 
and use of rescue therapy. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria: 
1.  Male  or  female  adults  aged  ≥40  years,  who  had  signed  an  Informed  Consent  Form  prior  to 
initiation of any study-related procedure. 
2.  Patients with severe to very severe COPD (Stage III or IV) according to the (GOLD Guidelines 
2008). 
3.  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (Ten pack-years were 
defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years). 
4.  Patients  with  a  post-bronchodilator  FEV1  <50%  of  the  predicted  normal  value,  and  post-
bronchodilator  FEV1/FVC  <0.70  at  Visit  2  (day  -14).  (Post  refers  to  1  h  after  sequential 
inhalation of 84 μg (or equivalent dose) of ipratropium bromide and 400 μg of salbutamol). 
5.  A documented history of at least 1 COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months that required 
treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics. 
Exclusion  criteria  included  Patients  who  had  a  COPD  exacerbation  that  required  treatment  with 
antibiotics, systemic steroids (oral or intravenous) or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or 
between  Visit  1  (Day  -21)  and  Visit  3  (Day  1);  and  Patients  who  developed  a  COPD  exacerbation 
during  a  period  between  Visit  1  and  3  were  ineligible  but  were  permitted  to  be  re-screened  after  a 
minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation.

Treatments 
The study consisted of three periods: the pre-randomization period, double-blind treatment period, and 
the variable double-blind treatment period where patients could have up to 76 weeks of treatment. In 
total,  each  completed  patient  attended  at  least  16  scheduled  visits  (64  weeks  of  treatment);  the 
optional variable double-blind treatment period was up to 12 weeks (2 additional clinic visits). All study 
treatments were given in addition to permitted COPD background therapy. The study design is shown 
in Figure 2-4. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  QVA149  110/50 μg  o.d.  was  superior  to 
NVA237  50  μg  o.d.  with  regard  to  the  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  during  the 
treatment period.  
The  key  secondary  objective  was  to  demonstrate that  QVA149  o.d.  was  superior  to  OL tiotropium  18 
μg o.d. with regard to the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during the treatment period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Number  of  adjudicated  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  during  the  treatment  period  was 
compared between QVA149 and NVA237. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint 
Moderate or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  were  adjudicated  by  an  independent  adjudication  committee 
of  three  pulmonologists  who  reviewed  all  blinded  moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  events  at 
regular  intervals  during  the  study,  to  ensure  that  these  were  true  moderate  or  severe  COPD 
exacerbations  events  and  not  cases  of  pneumonia  or  heart  condition  etc.  These  events  were 
adjudicated  as  to  whether  they  were  true  independent  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  or 
relapses/continuation of the previous events.  
A COPD exacerbation was defined as; A worsening of the following two or more major symptoms for at 
least 2 consecutive days: 
•  dyspnea 
•  sputum volume 
•  sputum purulence 
OR  A  worsening  of  any  1  major  symptom  together  with  an  increase  in  any  1  of  the  following  minor 
symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days: 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 60/99 
 
 
 
  
•  sore throat 
•  colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) 
•  fever without other cause 
•  cough 
•  wheeze 
Mild  COPD  exacerbations  are  the  worsening  of  the  above  symptoms  which  are  self-managed  (e.g. 
increase  in  salbutamol/albuterol  use)  by  patient  and  did  not  require  treatment  with  systemic 
glucocorticosteroids or antibiotics. 
A  COPD  exacerbation 
is  considered  of  moderate  severity 
if 
treatment  with  systemic 
glucocorticosteroids  or  antibiotics  or  both  was  required  and  severe  severity  if  hospitalization  was 
required. An emergency room (ER) visit of longer than 24 hours will be considered a hospitalization. 
The  start  date  for  a  COPD  exacerbation  recorded in  the  eCRF  should  be  the  first  day  of  worsening of 
two  or  more  major  symptoms  or  1  major  and  one  minor  symptom  as  defined  above.  The  end  of  a 
COPD exacerbation episode is marked by the return to pre-exacerbation symptom status. 
In patients with multiple exacerbations, if the start date of an exacerbation was less than 7 days after 
the end date of a previous episode, then this will be assumed to be one continuous exacerbation with 
the start date taken from the first episode and the end date from the second or last episode. The worst 
severity of these episodes will be taken as the severity of the collapsed exacerbation. 
Secondary endpoint 
The  rate  of  adjudicated  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  during  the  treatment  period  was 
compared between QVA149 and tiotropium. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  calculated  based  on  the  following  assumptions  for  the  primary  endpoint:  an 
event-rate of 1.1 based on the INSPIRE study (Wedzicha et al., 2008) and 0.88 based on the OPTIMAL 
study (Aaron et al., 2007) events per patient year on NVA237 and QVA149, respectively, a relative risk 
of 80%, two-sided α=0.05, and 10% (based on QAB2334 study) loss to follow-up. 
Assuming the event-rate on the tiotropium arm to be the same as the NVA237 arm and after adjusting 
for  multiplicity,  to  achieve  at  least  81%  power  on  the  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  (superiority  of 
QVA149  versus  tiotropium  on  the  rate  of  COPD  exacerbations)  approximately  734  patients  will  be 
needed for randomization to each arm. Total sample size is estimated at approximately 2,200. These 
sample size will give at least 88% power for the primary analysis. A mid-term blinded sample size re-
estimation  is  planned  to  check  whether  the  initial  estimate  of  the  standard  deviation  of  the  rate  of 
COPD exacerbations used for the initial sample size calculation is accurate. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by current/ex-smoker status and inhaled corticosteroid use. A treatment 
randomization  of  1:1:1  (QVA149:  NVA237:  open-label  tiotropium)  was  maintained  at  the  regional 
and/or  country  level,  not  center  level.  The  randomization  scheme  for  patients  was  reviewed  and 
approved by a member of the Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group.

Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blind to 
the  identity  of  the  treatment  from  the  time  of  randomization  until  database  lock,  using  the  following 
methods: 
(1) Randomization data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and were accessible 
by anyone else involved in the study. 
(2)  The  identity  of  the  treatments  was  concealed  by  the  use  of  study  drugs  that  were  all  identical  in 
packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odor. 
Unblinding occurred in the case of emergencies and at the conclusion of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed using a two-sided test at α = 0.05, to compare the rates 
(time-adjusted  numbers)  of  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  of  QVA149  versus  NVA237 
treatment groups over the treatment period.  
The  number  of  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  was  analyzed  using  the  Negative  Binomial 
model.  
A patient’s person-days at risk were considered to be the total amount of time (in days) he/she spent 
in  the  treatment  period.  The  person-days  at  risk  were  converted  to  person-days  at  risk  period 
equivalent to 1-year period by dividing by 365. The log (person-days at risk  period) was used as the 
offset  variable  in  the  Negative  Binomial  model.  An  estimate  of  the  ratio  of  exacerbation  rates  in  the 
treatment groups (QVA149/ NVA237) is presented together with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. 
If  the  confidence  interval  does  not  include  1.0,  with  ratio  estimate  less  than  1.0,  then  superiority  of 
QVA149 can be claimed. The primary analysis of the COPD exacerbation rates as described above was 
repeated for the Per-Protocol set as well as the FAS. 
The  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbation  (adjudicated  outcomes)  during  the  treatment 
period  was  compared  between  QVA149  and  tiotropium.  The  analysis  was  performed  using  the  same 
model  as  the  primary  analysis.  An  estimate  of  the  ratio  (using  tiotropium  as  reference)  of  COPD 
exacerbation rates in the treatment groups, together with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p-
values is presented. 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Since the Negative Binomial model includes the length of time the patient was in the study as an offset 
variable which automatically accounts for patients who discontinued prematurely, the primary analysis 
was  done  without  imputation.  Patients  who  discontinued  prematurely  were  followed-up  till the  end  of 
the study (i.e. 64- weeks period). During the post treatment follow-up, adverse events including COPD 
exacerbations  were  collected.  For  these  patients,  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  that 
occurred within 14 days of the last treatment date were added to the number of COPD exacerbations 
(adjudicated  events)  that  occurred  prior  to  discontinuation  from  the  study.  As  a  sensitivity  analysis, 
this augmented count of exacerbations was re-analyzed using a generalized linear model the same way 
as the primary analysis. 
Multiplicity control 
To  maintain  the  overall  type-I  error  rate  at  the  5%  level,  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy 
analyses were performed using the following hierarchical steps:  
Step 1: A two-sided superiority test of QVA149 versus NVA237 in terms of rate of moderate or severe

primary  objective).  If  this  test  was  non-significant,  then  planned  key  secondary  efficacy  tests  were 
reported as exploratory analyses. 
Step  2:  If  the  primary  efficacy  test  was  found  to  be  significant,  then  a  two  sided  superiority  test  of 
QVA149 versus tiotropium on the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during the treatment 
period (the key secondary objective) was performed at α=0.05. All other secondary variables were not 
adjusted for multiplicity. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 3865 patients were screened from 362 participating sites, of whom 2224 were randomized to 
one  of  the  three  treatment  groups  (QVA149,  NVA237  or  tiotropium)  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.  A  total of  1641 
patients failed screening prior to randomization at Visit 3; the most frequent reasons for screen failures 
were unacceptable test procedure result(s) and not meeting diagnostic/severity criteria (457 and 456 
patients patients, respectively, both 11.8%). Of the 2224 patients randomized to treatment, a total of 
1667  patients  (75.0%)  completed  the  study  as  planned;  that  is,  completed  at  least  the  64  week 
treatment  period,  with  some  patients  completing  a  total  of  76  weeks  including  the  variable  exposure 
treatment.  Study  discontinuations  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  NVA237  group.  Overall,  the  most 
common reasons for discontinuing from treatment were adverse event (AE) and withdrawal of consent. 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  was  similar  in  the  QVA149  and 
NVA237 groups but higher than the tiotropium group, however a greater percentage of patients in the 
tiotropium group discontinued due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect than in the QVA149 group.  
A  total  of  67  patients  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  death  (this  does  not  represent  the  total 
number of deaths, as patients may have discontinued for a different reason).  
Post-treatment  follow-up  was  the  period  following  study  drug  discontinuation  where  patients 
maintained the visit schedule without taking study medication, or any time more than 7 days (for AEs) 
or  30  days  (for  SAEs)  after  cessation  of  study  treatment.  Over  85%  of  patients  completed  the  post-
treatment follow-up, with withdrawal of consent being the most frequent cause of discontinuation. 
Recruitment 
The study was initiated 27 April 2010 (first patient first visit) and terminated 11 July 2011 (last patient 
last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  for  Study  A2304  was  amended  three  times.  There  were  no  other  changes  in  the 
study conduct, and the study was completed as planned. 
The  study  was  conducted  at  362  sites  worldwide.  One  site  was  closed  due  to  GCP  compliance  issues 
and the data from this site was not included in the analyses of the efficacy outcomes (9 patients)..  
Baseline data 
The three treatment groups were broadly similar for demographic and baseline disease characteristics. 
Overall,  patients  had  a  mean  age  of  63.3  years,  most  were  Caucasian  and  approximately  75%  were 
male.  A  slightly  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  QVA149  group  had  a  BMI  greater  than  30  kg/m2 
than in the NVA237 and tiotropium groups, but mean and median BMIs were similar. Otherwise, there 
were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in any sub-group.

Treatment groups had similar characteristics. A total of two patients (0.1%) had moderate COPD, with 
the  remainder  being  either  severe  (79.0%,  GOLD  stage  III)  or  very  severe  (20.9%,  GOLD  stage 
IV).The mean duration of COPD was 7.2 years. In the year prior to study entry, 76.2% of patients had 
experienced  one  moderate  to  severe  exacerbation  which  required  treatment  with  antibiotics  and/or 
steroids,  and  22.3%  of  patients  had  experienced  two  or  more  moderate  to  severe  exacerbations 
requiring hospitalization. These frequencies were similar across treatment groups. Approximately 75% 
of  patients  had  been  using  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  either  as  a  fixed  dose  combination  or  as 
monotherapy  at  baseline,  and  this  was  similar  across  treatment  groups.  There  were  no  imbalances 
between  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  history  of  cardiovascular  (CV)  disease  and  risk  factors.  In 
total,  88.5%  of  patients  had  a  history  of  at  least  one  CV  risk  factor.  The  most  common  CV  risk 
factors/diseases  were  hypertension  (almost  half  of  all  patients)  and  hyperlipidemia  (approximately 
one-quarter of all patients). Approximately 10% of patients had type 2 diabetes. 
There  were  no  imbalances  between  spirometry  measurements  at  screening.  The  overall  FEV1  post 
bronchodilator  percent  predicted  at  screening  was  37.2%  (1.04  L).  The  mean  post-bronchodilator 
reversibility  was  18.3%  overall,  with  patients  obtaining  a  mean  increase  in  FEV1  of  only  0.14  L  (140 
mL).  All  patients  had  a  post-bronchodilator  FEV1/FVC  less  than  70%.  Vital  signs  and  ECG 
characteristics at Screening showed no imbalances between treatment groups, with mean overall blood 
pressures of 131/80 mmHg. Overall, 73.3% of patients had a normal ECG interpretation at screening 
and 26.4% had a clinically insignificant abnormality. 
Numbers analysed 
The  Randomized  (RAN)  Set  was  comprised  of  all  randomized  patients,  regardless  of  whether  or  not 
they  actually  received  study  medication.  The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  included  all  randomized  patients 
who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug.  Following  the  intention-to-treat  principle,  the  Modified 
Full  Analysis  Set  (mFAS)  included  all  patients  in  the  Full  analysis  set  except  nine  patients  from  site 
820,  which  had  major  issues  with  GCP  compliance.  The  site  was  terminated,  the  health  authorities 
notified  and  data  from  these  nine  patients  was  excluded  from  certain  analyses  due  to  concerns  with 
validity. All efficacy endpoints, unless otherwise stated were analyzed using mFAS. The FAS was used 
only for sensitivity analysis of the primary variable. Per-protocol Set (PPS) included all patients in the 
mFAS  without  any  major  protocol  deviations.  Safety  Set  (SAF)  included  all  patients  who  received  at 
least  one  dose  of  study  drug  whether  or  not  they  were  randomized.  The  Modified  Safety  Set  (mSAF) 
included all patients in the Safety set except nine patients from site 820. The modified safety set was 
used in the analysis of all safety endpoints. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
Rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over the treatment period 
The  total  number  of  exacerbations  was  812,  900  and  898  in  the  QVA149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium 
groups,  respectively  .  QVA149  was  shown  to  be  clinically  and  statistically  superior  to  NVA237  in 
reducing the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, with a rate reduction of 12% for QVA149 
as  compared  to  NVA237  [Rate  ratio  (RR):  0.88,  95%  CI:  0.77-0.99,  p  =  0.038].  Thus,  the  primary 
objective was met.  
The  proportions  of  patients  with  at  least  one  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbation  over  the 
treatment  period  were  57.48%,  57.65%  and  54.55%  for  QVA149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium, 
respectively.

CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 64/99 
 
  
The  key  secondary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  QVA149  over  open-label  tiotropium 
with  regard  to  the  rate  of  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbations.  The  rate  reduction  was  10%  for 
QVA149 as compared to tiotropium (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79-1.02, p = 0.096).  
QVA149 treated patients also had the lowest rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations per year 
compared  to  NVA237  and  tiotropium  (0.94,  1.07  and  1.06,  respectively).  Based  on  this  rate,  the 
number needed to treat to prevent one additional moderate or severe exacerbation over a year in the 
QVA149 group was 8 vs. NVA237 and 9 vs. tiotropium. 
Ancillary analyses 
The rate reductions observed in the PP set (11% and 9%, respectively, favoring QVA149 vs. NVA237 
and  tiotropium)  were  similar  to  the  rate  ratios  observed  in  the  mFAS  set;  however,  statistically 
significant differences between treatments were not achieved. This may be due to the smaller number 
of patients and fewer exacerbations included in this analysis. 
Subgroup  results  for  the  rate  of  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  indicate  a  general  trend  in 
favor of QVA149 vs. NVA237 and tiotropium for the majority of subgroups.  
For moderate or severe exacerbations per year requiring treatment with both systemic corticosteroids 
and antibiotics, QVA149 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in rate of moderate to severe 
COPD  exacerbations  as  compared  to  NVA237  (21%,  p=0.005).  The  reduction  in  rate  for  QVA149  vs. 
tiotropium was 13% (p=0.094). 
For  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations  treated  with  systemic  corticosteroids  only,  the  rate  reduction 
was  20%  for  QVA149  as  compared  to  NVA237  (p=0.153)  and  22%  as  compared  to  tiotropium 
(p=0.095). 
For moderate or severe exacerbations treated with antibiotics only, the rate ratio was 1.10 for QVA149 
as compared to NVA237 (p=0.360) and 1.05 as compared to tiotropium (p=0.652).  
For moderate exacerbations, the rate reduction was 11% for QVA149 vs. NVA237 p=0.076) and 14% 
for QVA149 vs. tiotropium (p=0.03). 
The proportion of patients experiencing at least one severe COPD exacerbation was similar across the 
treatment groups (13.0%, 14.6% and 11.0% for QVA149, NVA237 and tiotropium, respectively). The 
odds ratio of 0.84 (CI 0.614, 1.156) favored QVA149 over NVA237, but statistical significance was not 
achieved. 
Time  to  first  severe  exacerbation  had  a  trend  towards  a  longer  time  to  exacerbation  in  the  QVA149 
group  vs.  the  NVA237  group;  however  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (HR  0.79, 
p=0.101). 
QVA149 was shown to be clinically and statistically superior to NVA237 and tiotropium in reducing the 
rate of all COPD exacerbations (mild, moderate and severe), with a rate reduction of 15% for QVA149 
as  compared  to  NVA237  (p  =  0.001)  and  a  rate  reduction  of  14%  as  compared  to  tiotropium 
(p=0.002). 
QVA149  demonstrated  a  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant  reduction in  the  rate of  mild 
exacerbations compared to both NVA237 (15%, p=0.007) and tiotropium (16%, p=0.005). 
QVA149 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function 
vs. NVA237 and tiotropium (pre-dose FEV1) at all visits. The magnitude of effect was between 0.070 
and 0.080 L compared to NVA237, and between 0.060 and 0.080 L compared to tiotropium (p<0.001).

For  LS  mean  pre-dose  FVC,  QVA149  demonstrated  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant 
increases  as  compared  to  both  NVA237  and  tiotropium  at  all  visits  during  the  64  week  treatment 
period,  with  a  treatment  difference  ranging  from  0.09  L  to  0.14  L  for  QVA149  vs.NVA237  and  from 
0.08  L  to  0.13  L  for  QVA149  vs.  tiotropium  (for  QVA149  vs.  NVA237,  all  p<0.004;  for  QVA149  vs. 
tiotropium, all p≤0.001). 
QVA149 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in SGRQ vs. NVA237 and tiotropium up to 
Week 64. The magnitude of effect was between -1.88 and -2.81 (p ≤0.007) compared to NVA237. The 
magnitude of effect was between -1.71 and -3.14 (p ≤0.011) compared to tiotropium. The proportion 
of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in the SGRQ total score (≥4 point reduction) was 
higher in the QVA149 group compared to the NVA and tiotropium group at all time points except week 
64. This was also statistically significant. 
QVA149  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  daily  rescue 
medication  usage  (albuterol/salbutamol).  The  reduction  in  daily  rescue  medication  usage  was 
approximately 0.81 inhalations per day compared to NVA237 and 0.76 inhalations per day compared to 
tiotropium. 
For  symptom  scores  over  the  treatment  period,  QVA149  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  total  daily  symptom  score  as  compared  to  NVA237  (LS  mean  difference  -0.37, 
p<0.001) and tiotropium (LS mean difference -0.44, p<0.001).  
For  time  to  premature  discontinuation,  a  higher  percentage  of  QVA149-treated  patients  remained  in 
the  study  compared  to  NVA237-treated  patients  at  each  time  point,  and  the  comparison  was 
statistically  in  favor  of  QVA149.  Except  for  the  end  of  the  study,  a  higher  percentage  of  QVA149- 
treated  patients  remained  in  the  study  compared  to  tiotropium-treated  patients,  but  statistical 
significance was not achieved.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No combined efficacy analyses were performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  studies  in  special  populations  were  performed  and  the  CHMP  didn’t  see  the  need  to  request  any 
specific  studies  at  this  stage.  In  addition,  this  is  adequately  addressed  in  section  4.2  ‘Special 
populations’ of the SmPC. 
Supportive studies 
Study 2305: Exercise endurance in moderate to severe COPD 
Study  2305  was  a  randomized,  blinded,  double-dummy,  multi-center,  placebo  controlled,  3  period, 
cross-over  study  to  assess  the  effect  of  QVA149  (110/50  μg  o.d.)  on  exercise  endurance  in  patients 
with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), using tiotropium as an active 
control. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  QVA149  110/50  μg  compared  with  placebo 
inhaled once daily on exercise tolerance as measured by exercise endurance time during a submaximal 
constant-load cycle ergometry test (SMETT) after three weeks of treatment. 
The  primary  variable  was  exercise  endurance  time  (in  seconds)  after  three  weeks  of  treatment.  The 
primary  variable  was  summarized  by  treatment  group  for  the  FAS.  No  testing  for  carryover  was 
performed  since  it  was  assumed  that  the  three-week  washout  was  adequate.  Treatment  comparisons 
between tiotropium versus placebo and QVA149 versus tiotropium were not controlled for multiplicity. 
Exercise  endurance  evaluated  by  using  cycle  ergometry  (SMETT)  showed  an  improvement  of 
approximately  60  seconds  after  three  weeks  of  treatment  with  QVA149  compared  to  placebo,  in 
patients  with  moderate  to  severe  COPD.  A  similar  effect  size  as  tiotropium  was  seen,  supporting  the 
efficacy of QVA149 and providing assay sensitivity. Two thirds of patients had moderate COPD and one

third  received  ICS  at  baseline.  Half  of  the  patients  were  current  smokers.  Subgroup  analysis  showed 
that  current  smoking  was  associated  with  less  improvement  in  the  exercise  endurance  time  for  both 
QVA149  and  tiotropium  compared  to  placebo.  Patients  taking  ICS  at  baseline  had  a  greater 
improvement  in  exercise  endurance  for  both  QVA149  and  tiotropium  compared  to  placebo,  although 
the  number  of  patients  was  small  (23-26  patients).  In  conclusion,  study  2305,  is  supportive  on  the 
efficacy  of  QVA149,  yielding  comparable  improvements  in  exercise  endurance  to  tiotropium,  of 
approximately 1 minute. 
Study A2307: one-year safety study 
Study QVA149A2307 was a safety study investigating the safety and tolerability of QVA149. Efficacy of 
FEV1  in  terms  of  LS  mean  treatment  difference  between  QVA149  and  placebo  was  considered  as  a 
secondary endpoint. 
Study 2307 was designed as multicenter, international randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, 
parallel studies of 52 weeks duration. Prior to randomization the patients attended a three weeks pre-
randomization period and all patients were followed up for 30 days after last dose of study medication. 
The study was conducted in 2010 to 2011 and according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, GCP as well as in compliance with global and local regulatory requirements. Study A2307 was 
amended twice and but none of the amendments are considered to influence the overall results of the 
studies.  
The primary and secondary outcome measure and study medication for Study A2307 is summarised in 
Table 6.

The study aimed to include the same patients as in Study A2303 and A2313 and consequently Study 
A2307 had similar in- and exclusion criteria as Study A2303 and A2313. 
Results  
A  total  of  498  patients  were  screened  and  339  patients  were  randomized:  226  patients  were 
randomized to treatment with QVA149 and 113 patients were randomized to placebo. A total of 83.5% 
(283  patients)  of  all  randomized  patients  completed  the  study:  85.8%  (194  patients)  randomized  to 
QVA149  and  78.8%  (89  patients)  randomized  to  placebo.  More  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
discontinued the study: 21.2% in the placebo-group vs. 14.2% in the QVA149 group. Discontinuation 
was mostly due to withdrawal of consent and AE(s). 
Overall the treatment groups were well balanced for demographic and baseline characteristics. In both 
treatment groups the majority of patients were Caucasian (79.1% and 83,2% respectively) and most 
patients  were  men  (77%).  Mean  age  was  63  years  in  both  treatment  groups  with  a  comparable 
amount of elderly defined as ≥65 years of age: 43% in both groups. Totally 29 patients (8.6%) were 
≥75 years. 
Disease history and baseline characteristics differed between treatment groups. Statistically significant 
more  patients  in  the  QVA149  group  had  severe  COPD  compared  to  patients  in  the  placebo  group: 
31.1% vs. 18.6% respectively (p=0.027). Mean duration of COPD was comparable (5.8 and 5.5 years 
respectively) but more patients in the QVA149 treated group had had COPD  for >15 years (6.7 % in 
the QVA149 group vs. 3.6% in the placebo group). There was a tendency towards more patients in the 
QVA149 group used ICS at baseline (45.8%) compared to patients in the placebo group (38.9%) but 
the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.247).  In  both  treatment  groups  45%  was  current 
smokers.  
There  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  treatment  groups  for  spirometry  measurements  at 
screening.  Overall,  FEV1  pre-bronchodilator  was  1.45  L  (≈50.5%  of  predicted  normal  and  FEV1)  and 
overall reversibility was 15.7%.  
Slightly  more  patients  in  the  QVA149  group  had  a  history  of  cardiovascular  disease  compared  to  the 
placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  pre-existing  diabetes  was  also  higher  in  the  QVA149 
group (12.4%) compared to placebo (8.0%). In contrast, hypertension and hyperlipidemia was slightly 
higher in the placebo group (46.9% and 27.4% respectively) compared to the QVA149 group (44.4% 
and 24.4% respectively). 
One of the two secondary efficacy endpoints for Study A2307 was to compare the bronchodilator effect 
of QVA149 with placebo based on the mean FEV1 at 15 and 45 minutes pre-dose at Week 52. 
At 52 weeks the LS mean difference for QVA149 was 1.607 L and for placebo the LS mean difference 
was  1.418  L.  Thus,  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  was  0.189  L.  The  difference  was  statistically 
significant (p<0.001) (Table 7).

Results for the exploratory efficacy objectives were all supporting the secondary efficacy objective. The 
treatment difference for FVC over the 52 week treatment period was statistically significant in favor of 
QVA149 at each time-point (all p<0.001).  
LS mean pre-dose FEV1 and FVC were both statistically significantly greater in the QVA149 group than 
in  the  placebo  group  at  all  visits  during  the  treatment  period  (all,  p<0.001).  For  FEV1  the  treatment 
difference ranged from 0.152 L to 0.189 L and for FVC the treatment difference ranged from 0.192 L to 
0.252 L (all, p<0.001). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
QVA149  is  a  novel  fixed-dose  combination  of  a  LABA  (indacaterol  maleate,  QAB149)  and  a  LAMA 
(glycopyrronium bromide, NVA237) intended as a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment to 
relieve  symptoms  and  reduce  exacerbations  in  patients  with  COPD.  Two  pivotal  studies,  A2303  and 
A2313,  investigated  the  efficacy  of  QVA149  on  trough  FEV1  for  26  weeks  compared  to  QAB149  and 
NVA237  (A2303)  and  fluticason/salmeterol  (A2313),  and  one  pivotal  study,  A2304,  investigated  the 
rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations in patients treated with QVA149 compared to NVA237 
and open-label tiotropium. Two supportive studies, A2305 and A2307, investigated exercise endurance 
after  three  weeks  of  treatment  with  QVA149  compared  to  placebo  and  safety  after  52  weeks  of 
treatment,  respectively.  In  study  A2307,  one  of  the  two  secondary  objectives  was  to  compare  the 
bronchodilator effect of QVA149 with placebo in terms of FEV1 at Week 52. All studies are considered 
to be well-designed, with appropriate comparators and fulfilling the requirements of the current CHMP 
guideline, and all three studies were conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, GCP as well as in compliance with global and local regulatory requirements. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Effect on symptom relief (FEV1) (A2303 and A2313) 
The  primary  objective  for  Study  A2303  and  A2313  was  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  QVA149 
compared  to  the  mono-components  QAB149  (indacaterol  maleate)  and  NVA237  (glycopyrronium 
bromide), open-label tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol and placebo in terms of FEV1 either as through 
FEV1  or  as  AUC0-12h  at  26  weeks  in  adult  symptomatic  males  and  females  age  ≥ 40  years  with  a 
clinical  diagnosis  of  stable  moderate  to  severe  COPD  (diagnosed  according  to  the  GOLD  guidelines 
2008) and a smoking history (current or ex-smokers) of at least 10 years. Mean reversibility (%) post-
bronchodilator  was  15.7%  –  20.4%.  A  certain  degree  of  reversibility  is  expected  according  to  the 
current GOLD guideline and also acceptable according to the current CHMP guideline, and overall it is 
acceptable. 
In  A2303,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  trough  FEV1  at  week  26,  showed  a  LS  mean  treatment 
difference  of  70  mL  when  QVA149  was  compared  to  QAB149,  and  of  90  mL  when  QVA149  was 
compared to NVA237. Both results were statistically significant (p<0.001 for both comparisons). With 
references  to  the  literature,  where  the  MCID  for  active  treatment  of  COPD  compared  to  placebo  is 
defined  as  100-140  mL,  the  Applicant  has  decided  to  use  120  mL  as  MCID,  which  is  acceptable.  The 
MCID concerning the comparison to an active comparator is more controversial and was also discussed 
by CHMP in the scientific advice given to the Applicant in 2009. When comparing QVA149 to the mono-
components, the Applicant has defined an MCID of 60 ml. The treatment differences between QVA149 
and  the  two  active  mono-components  are  statistically  significant  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  the 
improvement of 70-90 ml in trough FEV1 was questioned in the light of the MCID of 120 ml. Also the 
symptom scores evaluated (TDI and SGRQ) improved only marginally. Therefore the clinical benefit of 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report

Page 71/99 
 
  
combining  a  LAMA  and  a  LABA  compared  to  the  mono  components  was  not  considered  evident.  The 
Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  an  improvement  in  FEV1  of  70-90  ml  when 
QVA149 is compared to QAB149 and NVA237 in the light of the generally accepted MCID of 120 ml.  
For  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
in  Study  A2313,  superiority  of  QVA149  compared  to 
fluticasone/salmeterol was shown in terms of FEV1 AUC0-12h. After 26 weeks, the study showed a LS 
mean  treatment  difference  of  140  mL  (p<0.001).  However,  the  improvement  of  140  ml  is  not 
unexpected as QVA149 contains 2 bronchodilators compared to one in fluticasone/salmeterol. 
For the secondary endpoints, the changes in TDI were just clinically relevant with a LS mean treatment 
difference  of  1.09  when  QVA149  was  compared  to  placebo  (Study  A2303).  The  LS  mean  treatment 
difference of 0.21– 0.76 that was seen when QVA149 was compared to the active treatments (QAB149 
and  NVA237  in  Study  A2303  and  FLU/SAL  in  Study  A2313)  is  not  a  clinically  relevant  treatment 
difference  in  TDI  (transient  dyspnoea  index).  Neither  did  the  two  pivotal  studies  (A2303  and  A2313) 
find  a  clinically  relevant  treatment  difference  in  SGRQ  (St.  Georges  respiratory  questionnaire);  LS 
mean change ranged from -3.01 when compared to placebo to -2.13 – -1.09 when compared to active 
treatments.  Responder  analyses  of  TDI  and  SGRQ  scores  showed  results  in  favour  of  QVA149 
compared to placebo. Decrease in use of rescue medication was also considered to be of questionable 
clinically  importance  as  the  LS  mean  treatment  difference  between  QVA149  and  placebo  or  active 
treatment  in  all  cases  was  <1  puff/day.  The  results  for  SGRQ  score  and  reductions  in  rescue 
medications were similar in studies A2303, A2313 and A2304.  
In  its  response,  the  Applicant  provided  further  justification  for  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  of 
QVA149  compared  to  that  of  the  individual  components.  This  justification  included  NNT  analyses, 
among  others.  While  the  mean  differences  in  spirometric  and  in  particular  symptomatic  endpoints 
between QVA149 and its individual components did not reach the threshold for clinical relevance in the 
context of a comparison to placebo, the differences cannot be regarded as trivial for some patients as 
shown  by  the  responder  analysis.  Looking  at  the  results  in  totality,  it  is  considered  that  there  is  a 
benefit associated with the use of QVA149 compared to its individual components. However, treatment 
guidelines do not recommend the combination of a LABA and a LAMA as  first choice in COPD. Hence, 
the Applicant was requested to justify the first-line indication for symptomatic treatment. 
The Applicant presented results on trough FEV1 according to previous treatment: No prior treatment 
(“First-line”) or various previous treatments (“Second-line”). QVA149 is superior to the active 
comparators in all subpopulations. However, it is should be noted that the difference between QVA149 
and QAB149 (indacaterol as monotherapy) is generally larger in patients with prior treatment than in 
patients with no prior treatment. For the differences between QVA149 and the two LAMAs (NVA237 
and tiotropium), there is no clear pattern, and the differences are quite similar. 
Looking  at  the  results  in  totality,  it  is  considered  that  there  is  a  benefit  associated  with  the  use  of 
QVA149  compared  to  its  individual  components.  Taking  into  account  the  relatively  benign  safety  and 
tolerability  profile  of  QVA149,  a  first-line  indication  for  symptomatic  treatment  is  considered 
adequately justified. 
Ancillary analyses including post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed in studies A2303 and A2313. 
The  subgroups  included  age,  gender,  race,  smoking  status,  COPD  disease  severity,  baseline  ICS  use, 
FEV1  reversibility  and  FEV1  median  reversibility.  The  choice  of  subgroups  seems  overall  appropriate. 
Overall  there  were  no  differences  between  the  subgroups  which  all  supported  the  results  from  the 
primary efficacy analyses. The exception from this was subgroup analysis of the FEV1 reversibility and 
FEV1  median  reversibility.  For  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a  FEV1  reversibility  ≤ 5%,  the  LS  mean 
treatment difference of QVA149 compared to placebo as well as active comparators (QAB149, NVA237, 
tiotropium and FLU/SAL) were 20-70 mL which in both studies was not statistically significant and also 
of doubtful clinical relevance. Results from the subgroups of patients with a FEV1 reversibility of ‘>5%

Page 72/99 
 
  
and  ≤ 12%  and  >12%’were  in  line  with  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints  and  were  all  statistically 
significant.  The  Applicant appropriately  addressed these  findings  about the  dependence of  efficacy  on 
the reversibility in the SmPC. 
Effect on reducing the rate of exacerbations (A2304) 
According  to  the  EMA  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of 
COPD,  the  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  is  a  clinically  relevant endpoint that  should  be 
assessed during a study period of at least 1 year due to seasonal variation. Two comparators, NVA237 
and open label tiotropium, were evaluated in this study in patients with severe to very severe COPD, 
with  at  least  1  exacerbation  in  the  preceding  year.  Neither  of  the  comparators  have  the  licensed 
indication  of  reducing  rate  of  exacerbations.  A  major  issue  concerned  the  primary  endpoint,  rate  of 
moderate  to  severe  exacerbations,  as  the  difference  compared  to  the  comparator  NVA237,  although 
statistically  significant,  is  very  small.  An  absolute  reduction  in  the  rate  of  exacerbations  was  0.13 
exacerbations  per  year.  Key  secondary  endpoint  was  a  comparison  to  tiotropium,  giving  very  similar 
results  as  for  NVA237,  although  not  statistically  significant.  Time  to  first  moderate  to  severe  COPD 
exacerbation  was  comparable  between  the  three  treatments  (QVA149,  NVA237  and  tiotropium)  with 
time-to-event (25% percentile) of 83 days.  
In  its  response,  the  Applicant  made  an  effort  to  substantiate  the  evidence  regarding  the  claim.  This 
included historical data with QAB149, NVA237, tiotropium and placebo. It has to be acknowledged that 
Study  A2304  seen  in  the  context  of  the  historical  data  may  suggest  that  QVA149  likely  reduces 
exacerbations  compared  to  placebo  to  a  clinically  significant  extent.  However,  QVA149  has  not 
convincingly shown incremental benefit in reducing exacerbations compared to NVA237 and tiotropium 
– none of which have been granted a specific exacerbation claim.  
The  number  of  all  (mild,  moderate  and  severe)  exacerbations  was  significantly  lower  for  patients 
treated with QVA149 compared to NVA237; however the absolute reduction in the annualized rate was 
0.6  exacerbations  per  year.  A  number  of  analyses  concerning  exacerbations  treated  with  systemic 
corticosteroids  and  antibiotics,  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  severe  COPD 
exacerbation  and  number  of  mild  exacerbations  showed  both  significant  and  non-significant  results; 
however all were small absolute reductions. Fewer patients in study A2304 had ≥ 4 moderate to severe 
exacerbations  in  the  study  period  in  the  QVA149  arm  (n=44)  compared  to  NVA237  (n=65)  and 
tiotropium (n=73). 
Overall,  one  may  question  whether  the  population  selected  for  Study  2304  was  appropriate  for  the 
purpose  of  the  study  in  terms  of  exacerbation  frequency  (e.g.  over  the  preceding  year)  at  baseline.  
Unlike tiotropium and glycopyrronium, the combination fluticasone/salmeterol has patients with COPD 
with  a  FEV1  <  60%  predicted  and  frequent  exacerbations  mentioned  in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC, 
although not as a specific prevention of exacerbations claim. However, the patient population of study 
A2304  is  not  selected  for  having  a  FEV1  <  60%  and  having  repeated  exacerbations.  This  population 
has not been studied. 
As  the  benefits  of  QVA149  in  terms  of  reducing  exacerbations  were  not  considered  to  sufficiently 
demonstrate  in  order  to  support  a  specific  exacerbation  indication,  the  Applicant  was  asked  further 
justify such claim. In its response, the Applicant made an effort to substantiate the evidence regarding 
the  claim.  This  included  historical  data  with  QAB149,  NVA237,  tiotropium  and  placebo.  It  has  to  be 
acknowledged  that  Study  A2304  seen  in  the  context  of  the  historical  data  may  suggest  that  QVA149 
likely  reduces  exacerbations  compared  to  placebo  to  a  clinically  significant  extent.  However,  QVA149 
has  not  convincingly  shown  incremental  benefit  in  reducing  exacerbations  compared  to  NVA237  and

tiotropium  –  none  of  which  have  been  granted  a  specific  exacerbation  claim.  Therefore,  the 
exacerbation claim was removed from the indication. 
Improvement in lung function as measured by trough FEV1, of 0.06 to 0.08 L, was seen and supports 
the efficacy of QVA149 in symptom relief.  
Supportive studies (A2305 and A2307) 
A2305  was  a  randomized,  blinded,  double-dummy,  multi-center,  placebo  controlled,  3  period,  cross-
over  study  to  assess  the  effect  of  QVA149  (110/50  μg  o.d.)  on  exercise  endurance  in  patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  using  tiotropium  as  an  active 
control. 
In  study  A2305,  exercise  endurance  evaluated  by  using  cycle  ergometry  (SMETT)  showed  an 
improvement of  approximately  60  seconds  after  three  weeks  of  treatment  with  QVA149  compared  to 
placebo,  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  COPD.  Subgroup  analysis  showed  that  current  smoking 
was associated with less improvement in the exercise endurance time for both QVA149 and tiotropium 
compared  to  placebo  and  patients  taking  ICS  at  baseline  had  a  greater  improvement  in  exercise 
endurance  for  both  QVA149  and  tiotropium  compared  to  placebo,  however  number  of  patients  were 
small  (23-26  patients).  In  conclusion,  study  2305,  is  supportive  on  the  efficacy  of  QVA149,  yielding 
comparable improvements in exercise endurance to tiotropium, approximately 1 minute. 
Study  A2307  was  an  international,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-
controlled study with a duration of 52 weeks to assess the safety/tolerability of 52 weeks of treatment 
with  QVA149.  The  secondary  endpoint,  the  bronchodilator  effect  of  QVA149  compared  to  placebo 
based on the mean FEV1 at 15 and 45 minutes pre-dose at Week 52, showed a difference of 189 ml 
(p<0.001) and thus a sustained effect. 
The  term  "once-daily"  refers  to  posology  and  is  not  appropriate  in  the  indication  text.  Therefore  the 
Applicant was requested to remove it from section 4.1 as this section is intended to specify the target 
population but not the method of use or posology.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  QVA149  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  on  symptom  relief  (FEV1) 
compared to placebo and active comparators when administrated to patients with moderate to severe 
COPD.  The  treatment  effect  was  generally  consistent  across  primary  and  secondary  lung  function 
efficacy endpoints and appears to be sustained over time up till 26 and 52 weeks. Compared to active 
treatment including the mono-components as well as established treatment with open-label tiotropium 
and  FLU/SAL  the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  were  considered  to  be  consistent  and 
statistically significant. In Study A2313, the LS mean treatment difference of FEV1 AUC0-12h after 26 
weeks  was  140  ml  when  QVA149  was  compared  to  fluticasone/salmeterol.  In  study  A2303  the  LS 
mean  treatment  difference  of  FEV1  was  70  mL,  when  QVA149  was  compared  to  QAB149  and  90  mL 
when  QVA149  was  compared  to  NVA237.  While  the  mean  differences  in  spirometric  and  in  particular 
symptomatic endpoints between QVA149 and its individual components did not reach the threshold for 
clinical  relevance  in  the  context  of  a  comparison  to  placebo,  the  differences  cannot  be  regarded  as 
trivial for some patients as shown by the responder analyses. The incremental benefit compared to the 
monocomponents  and  tiotropium  is  largely  the  same  irrespective  of  COPD  severity  and  whether 
patients  received  prior  treatment  or  not  –  with  one  exception:  the  difference  between  QVA149  and 
QAB149  appeared  larger  in  patients  with  prior  treatment  than  in  patients  with  no  prior  treatment. 
Looking  at  the  results  in  totality,  it  is  considered  that  there  is  a  benefit  associated  with  the  use  of 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 74/99 
 
 
  
QVA149  compared  to  its  individual  components.  Taking  into  account  the  relatively  benign  safety  and 
tolerability  profile  of  QVA149,  a  first-line  indication  for  symptomatic  treatment  is  considered 
adequately justified. 
In  the  exacerbation  study  (A2304),  the  overall  rate  of  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbations  per 
year  was  0.94  for  QVA149,  1.07  for  NVA237  and  1.06  for  tiotropium.  The  analysis  of  the  primary 
endpoint,  rate  of  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbations  per  year,  resulted  in  a  rate  ratio  of  0.88 
(95%  CI  0.77-0.99;  p=0.038)  when  QVA149  and  NVA237  was  compared.  The  absolute  difference  in 
the  rate  of  exacerbations  per  year  was  0.13  (1.07-0.94=0.13).  Even  though  the  difference  is 
statistically significant, it is very small. The analysis of the secondary endpoint showed a rate ratio of 
0.90  (95%  CI  0.79-1.02;  p=0.096)  when  QVA149  and  tiotropium  was  compared.  The  absolute 
difference  in  the  rate  of  exacerbations  per  year  was  0.12.  In  summary,  the  treatment  differences  to 
the  comparators  are  very  small  and  only  achieved  statistical  significance  (borderline)  for the  NVA237 
comparison.  It  should  be  noted  that  neither  of  the  two  comparators  have  reduction  of  COPD 
exacerbations  as  a  licensed  indication  in  the  EU/EEA.  About  75%  of  patients  only  experienced  one 
COPD  exacerbation  in  the  previous  year,  and  more  than  40%  of  the  study  population  did  not 
experience an exacerbation during the entire study  period. This puts into question whether the study 
population was sick enough in terms of COPD exacerbations in order to detect a meaningful difference. 
It is acknowledged that fewer patients in study A2304 had ≥4 moderate to severe exacerbations in the 
study  period  in  the  QVA149  arm  (n=44)  compared  to  NVA237  (n=65)  and  tiotropium  (n=73).  This 
suggests  that  QVA149  could  exhibit  clinically  relevant  efficacy  in  patients  with  many  exacerbations. 
However, the analysis is secondary, and patient numbers are small. Overall, the benefits of QVA149 in 
terms of reducing exacerbations have not been sufficiently demonstrated in order to support a specific 
exacerbation indication. 
Results from the secondary symptomatic endpoints for all studies were somewhat more diverse. There 
was  a  tendency  towards  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  the  experience  of  breathlessness  (TDI 
score)  whereas  the  changes  in  health  related  quality  of  life  (SGRQ  score)  and  the  use  of  rescue 
medication  (number  of  puffs)  were  less  impressive,  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  are 
questionable. 
Therefore,  the  exacerbation  claim  was  removed  from  the  indication  in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC. 
However, relevant information from the exacerbation study A2304 and from study A2313 is addressed 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database for QVA149 110/50 μg once daily comprises all patients from the following clinical 
studies  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug.  Studies  were  pooled  to  provide  an  integrated 
safety  profile.  The  pooled  populations  were  organized  into  four  datasets  according  to  the  type  of 
clinical trial, overall design and different patient populations based on COPD severity. 
• 
The  Core  Safety  database  comprises  two  safety  populations  from  a  pool  of  two  placebo  
controlled Phase III studies, consisting of moderate to severe COPD patients: 
•   The  Core  6-month  Safety  database:  Study  A2303  (QVA149  and  placebo  patients) 
and the first 6-month data from Study A2307 (1044 patients). 
•  The  Core  12-month  Safety  database:  12-month  data  from  Study  A2307  (338 
patients).                    
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 75/99 
 
 
  
The  Core  6-month  Safety  database  includes  6-month  data  from  the  12-month  study,  A2307. 
Therefore, it should be noted that there is overlap between the 6 and 12 month populations. 
• 
The Major 6-month Safety database includes the pooled safety populations (3153 patients) 
from 3 large, pivotal placebo- and active-controlled Phase III studies (A2303, A2307 (the first 
6-month data), and A2313) and one local safety study conducted in Japan (A1301- the first 24 
weeks  interim  data  from  this  1-year  study).  This  also  consists  of  moderate  to  severe  patient 
populations.  Since  this  database  includes  6  month  data  from  A2303  and  A2307,  there  is 
substantial overlap between the Core 6-month and Major 6-month safety databases. 
•

The  Exacerbation  Safety  database  (2206  patients)  comprises  safety  patients  from  Study 
A2304  alone.  This  is  a  long-term  15  month  database  (with  data  up  to  18  months  for  a 
subgroup  of  patients)  and  consists  of  a  severe  to  very  severe  COPD  population.  Thus,  this 
study is not pooled with any other Phase III studies. 
The  All-treated  Safety  database  (6921  patients  and  healthy  volunteers)  comprises  all 
QVA149 studies from Phase I, II and III. Of note is that treatment periods vary from 1 day to 
18 months, the patients and healthy volunteers in the cross-over designs are counted multiple 
times and the Phase I studies do not provide additional data on comparators. 
Patient exposure 
The  tables  below  show  the  duration  of  exposure  to  study  drug  after  randomisation  for  the  core  6-
month and major 6-month safety databases.

Adverse events 
Summaries  of  AEs  and  SAEs  are  based  on  treatment-emergent  (i.e.  newly  occurring  or  worsening 
during  treatment  period)  undesirable  signs,  symptoms,  or  medical  conditions  after  the  first  dose  of 
study  drug,  including  events  likely  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  disease  or  likely  to  represent

concomitant  illness.  Any  AEs  whose  start  dates  were  before  the  first  dose  date  were  considered  as 
medical  history.  The  reporting  of  AEs  covers  common  AEs,  SAEs  including  fatal  AEs,  and  other 
significant AEs. 
A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE was counted only once in the AE category. A patient with 
multiple  adverse  events  was  counted  only  once  in  the  ‘any  preferred  term’  row.  Preferred  terms  are 
sorted in descending order of percentage according to the QVA149 110/50 μg treatment group. 
AEs  are  summarised  by  preferred  term  for  the  most  frequent  AEs  (≥  1%  in  any  group).  The  1% 
threshold  used  in  these  summary  tables  was  chosen  to  enable  concise  presentation  based  on  overall 
AE frequencies.

Core  6-month  Safety  database:  There  are  several  event  rates  in  favor  of  QVA149,  were  the  most 
predominant  are  the  rate  of  COPD  disease,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  bacterial  and  diarrhea.  
However, there are also several tendencies seen in the data that favors placebo, especially with regard 
to  cough,  headache  and  urinary  tract  infections.  Some  of  the  events  may  represent  either  beta-
adrenergic or anticholinergic effects. 
Core 12-month Safety database: the overall percentage of patients with AEs was similar between the 
QVA149  group  (57.8%)  and  placebo  group  (56.6%).  Overall,  the  most  commonly  reported  AE  was 
COPD  (including  disease  progression  and  exacerbations;  QVA149  28.0%  vs.  placebo  25.7%).  Viral

upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and hypertension AEs were reported 
for  a  lower  percentage  of  patients  in  the  QVA149  group  than  the  placebo  group.  Cough,  lower 
respiratory tract infections and pyrexia were reported for a slightly higher percentage of patients in the 
QVA149  group  compared  with  placebo.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  pneumonia  was  3.6%  in  the 
QVA149 and 0 in the placebo group. Other AEs occurred in few patients and the differences between 
treatment groups were not meaningful. 
An imbalance in pneumonia and lower tract infection was noted. However, these differences are caused 
by an imbalance in baseline characteristics, where more severe patients were included in the QVA149 
group by chance. The reason for the imbalance in baseline characteristics is that stratification was only 
based on smoking status.  
Major 6-month Safety database: Overall, the most frequently reported AE was COPD (including disease 
progression and exacerbations) for all treatment groups, which was reported for a lower percentage of 
patients  in  the  QVA149  group  (23.0%)  than  for  the  QAB149  (32.1%),  NVA237  (31.7%)  and  Tio 
(27.6%) groups and was similar to the Flut/Salm group (23.5%). Not unexpectedly, COPD reported as 
AE was also higher for the placebo group (32.5%).  
Exacerbation  Safety  database:  18.1  %  (QVA149)  vs.  15.6%  (Tio)  of  the  patients  experienced  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  bacterial;  however,  the  Applicant  has  provided  reassuring  data  that  show 
that all data taken together, there is no safety concern. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Core 6-month Safety Database: Overall, the number of SAE’s in the Core 6-month safety database is 
unremarkable between the two groups. 
Core  12-month  Safety  Database:  A  difference  between  the  overall  number  of  SAEs  37/225  (16.4%) 
QVA149  and  12/113  (10.6%)  placebo  was  initially  identified.  However,  further  data  provided  by  the 
Applicant showed that these differences are caused by an imbalance in baseline characteristics, where 
more severe patients were included in the QVA149 group by chance. The reason for the imbalance in 
baseline  characteristics  is  that  stratification  was  only  based  on  smoking  status  according  to  CHMP 
guidelines. Furthermore, a higher discontinuation rate was observed in the placebo group leading to a 
healthier population in the placebo group.  
Major  6-month  Safety  Database:  Overall,  the  event  rates  were  unremarkable,  and  there  is  no  clear 
imbalance.  
Exacerbation Safety Database: 7 cases of acute respiratory failure were identified in the QVA149 group 
vs.  6  cases  in  the  NVA237  vs.  1  case  in  the  tiotropium  group.  Case  narratives  from  the  Applicant  do 
not indicate a causal relationship to QVA149.   
Overall,  the  SAE  rate  seems  to  increase  slightly  from  0-3  months  and  3-6  months.  According  to  the 
Applicant,  this  is  due  to  the  influence  of  study  A2307  at  3-6  months,  where  there  is  a  substantial 
overlap. In general the event rates are stable across different time intervals. 
Adverse events of special interest 
With  regard  to  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (CCV,  symptoms  compatible  with  anticholinergic  or 
beta-adrenergic  effects,  paradoxical  bronchospasm,  and  respiratory  composite  endpoint  (incl. 
pneumonia,  LRTI,  URTI,  bronchitis),  in  total  12  cases  of  new  onset  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  were  seen 
versus  0  in  the  placebo group.  The  safety  database,  “All-COPD  Safety  database”  showed  however  no 
relevant differences between QVA149 and other treatment groups.

Deaths 
Core 6-month Safety Database: Two deaths were observed in the QVA149 group (N=699). One death 
was  caused  by  cancer  and  is  highly  unlikely  to  be  related  to  QVA149  and  the  second  death  was  a 
cardiovascular death. No deaths were observed in the placebo group.   
Core 12-month Safety Database: Four patients died in the active treatment period + 1 patient in the 
follow-up period in the QVA149 group. One patient died (traffic accident) in the placebo group. The five 
patients that died in the QVA149 group; three died from COPD exacerbations, one from cardiovascular 
sudden death, and one from metastasized cancer.  
Major 6-month Safety Database: The total number of deaths is small and seems to be similar between 
the active treatment groups. No deaths were observed in placebo group. Three deaths were observed 
in the QVA149. One died of cancer and two died of cardiovascular sudden death.  
Exacerbation  Safety  Database:  The  total  number  of  death  events  seems  equal  between  the  three 
groups. Looking at the data in more detail, there is an overweight of deaths with cardiovascular cause 
in the tiotropium group, while there is an overweight of deaths with respiratory cause in the QVA149 
group, when comparing these two groups. 
Laboratory findings 
In  both  the  Core-6  month  and  Major  6-month  database,  a  higher  frequency  of  worsening  in 
haemoglobin was seen.   
In  the  Major  6-month  database,  there  was  a  higher  frequency  of  BUN  (blood  urea  nitrogen)  in  the 
QVA149  group  compared  to  Flut/Salm  and  Placebo  (2.3%  vs.  1.3%  vs.  1.3  %  respectively).  Similar 
frequencies are observed in the other active group.  
In the Core 12-month safety database 22.2% vs. 15% of the patients had pulse rates of > 90 bpm in 
QVA149  and  placebo  respectively.  This  may  reflect  the  beta-adrenergic  component  of  QVA149. 
Analysis of systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not show any clinically significant differences.  
The  Major  6-month  safety  database  showed  that  post-baseline  systolic  blood  pressure  values  were 
lower in the QVA149 group and the other active groups compared to placebo, but the differences were 
not clinically relevant.   
Two patients in the Major 6-month safety database experienced a QTc > 500 ms in the QVA149 group 
compared to 0 in all other (active + placebo) groups. However, one patient had a QTc value >500 ms 
on  Day  1  (509  ms  at  25  minutes  pre-dose,  512  ms  1  hour  post-dose)  and  the  other  patient  had  a 
prolonged QTc at screening (490 ms). 
The  CHMP  noted  a  difference  in  QTc  in  the  30-60  ms  between  QVA149  and  tiotropium  in  the 
Exacerbation  database.  The  Applicant  provided  reassuring  evidence  that  shows  no  differences  in  the 
Major  6-month  Safety  database,  which  is  considered  the  main  safety  database.    Furthermore,  the 
thorough  QTc  studies  of  the  monocomponent  did  not  identify  any  clinically  relevant  problem  with 
regard to QTc prolongation.  
A significant number of newly occurring first degree AV blocks were seen in the Core 6-month safety 
database,  33/699  (4.9%)  in  QVA149  vs.  15/345  (4.7%)  in  placebo.  However,  the  Applicant  has 
provided the All-COPD safety database, where no relevant differences are observed.  
Safety in special populations 
AEs were evaluated in demographic subgroups (age, sex, and race), by baseline characteristics (COPD 
severity, and CCV risk factors), by exposure category, by baseline steroid use, and by smoking status.

Effect of age:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  highest  in  >  75  years  group  in  the  QVA149,  while  in  the 
placebo group it was the 65 to <75 years.   
In general higher rates of respiratory infections were seen in the > 75 years group.  
In  the  Exacerbation  database  the  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  is  30.2%  vs.  20.4%  in  the  >  75 
years.  
There  were  4  cases  of  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  compared  to  0  in  the 
placebo  group  in  the  ≥  75  years  group  in  the  Major  6-month  database.  Also,  3  cases  of 
infections and infestations were seen in the QVA149 compared to 0 in placebo group. 
Effect of gender: In general female patients reported more adverse events than male patient. This is a 
known phenomenon in clinical trials. The event rates were similar between QVA149 and placebo. 
Effect of race: The majority of patients were Caucasians. Asian patients had tendency to report fewer 
AEs in the QVA149 group compared to placebo, where Asian patients either had similar or higher rates 
of AEs compared to Caucasians.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Two  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  examine  the  systemic  exposure  to  the  QVA149 
monotherapy components [Study A2101] and [Study A2106]. The results showed no pharmacokinetic 
interactions  between  the  compounds.  No  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  with 
QVA149. Information on the potential for interactions for QVA149 is based on the potential for each of 
its  two  monotherapy  components.  Care  should  be  taken  when  taking  QVA149  in  combination  with 
other β-adrenergic agonists or muscarinic antagonists, in case of additive effects. No specific drug-drug 
interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  QVA149.  Information  on  the  potential  for  interactions  for 
QVA149 is based on the potential for each of its two components. 
Anticipated interactions resulting in concomitant use not being recommended include: 
Beta-adrenergic  blockers  which  may  weaken  or  antagonize  the  effect  of  beta-adrenergic  receptors. 
Therefore  QVA149  should  not  be  given  together  with  beta-adrenergic  blockers  (including  eye  drops) 
unless  there  are  compelling  reasons  for  their  use.  Where  required,  cardioselective  beta-adrenergic 
blockers should be preferred, although they should be administered with caution. 
Sympathomimetic  agents.  Concomitant  administration  of  other  sympathomimetic  agents  (alone  or  as 
part of combination therapy) may potentiate the undesirable effects of indacaterol. 
Hypokalemia.  Concomitant  treatment  with  methylxanthine  derivatives,  steroids,  or  nonpotassium-
sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
QAB149 
Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) raises the 
systemic  exposure  of  indacaterol  by  up  to  two-fold.  The  magnitude  of  exposure  increases  due  to 
interactions  does  not  raise  any  safety  concerns  given  the  safety  experience  of  treatment  with 
indacaterol  in  clinical  studies  of  up  to  one  year  at  doses  up  to  twice  the  maximum  recommended 
therapeutic  dose.  Indacaterol  has  not  been  shown  to  cause  interactions  with  co-medications.  In  vitro 
investigations  have  indicated  that  indacaterol  has  negligible  potential  to  cause  metabolic  interactions 
with medicinal products at the systemic exposure levels achieved in clinical practice.

In vitro studies showed that glycopyrronium is unlikely to inhibit or to induce the metabolism of other 
drugs,  as  well  as  processes  involving  drug  transporters.  Metabolism  plays  a  secondary  role  in  the 
elimination of glycopyrronium and multiple enzymes are involved. Inhibition or induction of metabolism 
of  glycopyrronium  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  relevant  change  of  glycopyrronium  exposure.  In  clinical 
pharmacokinetic  studies,  no  clinically  relevant  interaction  was  observed  when  glycopyrronium  was 
administered concomitantly with cimetidine, an orally given inhibitor of the organic cation transport in 
the kidneys (the primary route for glycopyrronium excretion). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Core 6-month Safety Database: The overall discontinuation rate is lower for the QVA149 group. There 
are 5 cases of discontinuation in the placebo group due to COPD, although there were no clear trends. 
There were few sporadic cases of cancers in both groups but no conclusions can be drawn based on the 
relatively short exposure time. 
Core 12-month Safety Database: The overall discontinuation rate is lower for QVA149, but there are 5 
(2.2%) events vs. 1 (0.9%) event with regard to COPD and 4 (1.8%) events vs. 0 events with regard 
to  pneumonia.  This  reflects  the  previous  concerns  of  higher  incidence  of  pneumonia  in  the  QVA149 
group. 
Major  6-month  Safety  Database:  In  general,  the  overall  discontinuation  rate  is  low  for  the  QVA149 
group,  and  the  main  cause  of  discontinuation  is  COPD,  where  the  rate  is  similar  across  all  groups, 
except for fluticasone/salmeterol, which was higher. 
Exacerbation  Safety  Database:  The  overall  discontinuation  rate  is  unremarkable  between  the  three 
treatment arms. However, there is a higher rate of discontinuation due to COPD and pneumonia in the 
QVA149 group compared to the tiotropium.  
In general, the data show lower or similar discontinuation rates in the QVA149 group across all safety 
databases. 
Post-marketing experience 
There are no post-marketing surveillance data available for QVA149 for the target indication of COPD 
at this time. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The number of patients and the extent of exposure fulfil the ICH guidelines (E1). A significant number 
of patients have been exposed to QVA149 in an acceptable timeframe of 6 to 15 months.  
Approximately 22-25% of the patients were female, which is considered satisfactory. Though, a higher 
number of females would have been desirable, since the proportion of female COPD patients is higher 
in some European countries. 
The  CHMP  initially  noted  a  higher  incidence  of  a  number  of  cardiovascular  events  with  QVA149,  and 
these findings raised questions about the cardiovascular safety of QVA149. There was an imbalance in 
MACE  in  the  core  12-month  safety  database  with  8  (3.6%)  vs.  1  (0.9%)  events  of  MACE  in  the 
QVA149 and placebo groups, respectively. There were also more cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter and 
new onset first degree AV blocks (core 6-month safety database) and a  higher proportion of patients 
with an increase in QTc of 30-60 ms  (exacerbation safety database) in patients treated with QVA149 
compared to patients treated with placebo or other treatment groups.

CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 84/99 
 
  
Further, in patients treated with QVA149 there was a higher frequency of pneumonia (core 12-month 
safety  database),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  bacterial  (exacerbation  safety  database),  overall 
higher  number  of  SAEs  primarily  due  to  cardiac  disorders  and  infections/infestations  (core  12-month 
safety  database),  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  in  patients  ≥ 75  years  (major  6-
month safety database and exacerbation safety database), respiratory failure and COPD (exacerbation 
safety database) compared to the tiotropium group. There was also a higher discontinuation rate due 
to COPD and pneumonia in the core 12-month and exacerbation safety database. 
To  address  the  above-mentioned  concerns  the  applicant  provided  a  safety  dataset  that  included  the 
entire COPD population, “All-COPD Safety database”. 
Regarding  the  concern  of  an  increased  risk  of  MACE  related  to  the  use  of  QVA149  in  the  Core  12-
month  Safety  database,  the  Applicant  provided  reassurance  that  showed  that  the  increased  risk  of 
MACE  in  Core  12-month  Safety  database  (study  A2307)  is  attributable  to  the  imbalance  in  baseline 
characteristics  of  study  A2307  and  that  the  totality  of  data  does  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of 
cardiovascular events. 
The imbalance in atrial fibrillation/flutter and new onset AV block observed in the Core 6-month Safety 
database was addressed with data from the new All-COPD safety database that showed that the overall 
incidence  rates  are  in  general  similar.  There  were  no  events  in  the  placebo  group,  but  this  group  is 
rather small compared to the QVA149 group.  
With  regards  to  the  concerns  raised  on  the  difference  in  QTc  in  the  30-60  ms  between  QVA149  and 
tiotropium in the Exacerbation database, the reassuring evidence provided by the Applicant showed no 
differences  in  the  Major  6-month  Safety  database,  which  is  considered  the  main  safety  database. 
Furthermore, the thorough QTc studies of the monocomponents did not identify any clinically relevant 
problem with regard to QTc prolongation. 
In summary, the evidence provided by the Applicant showed that the imbalances in AEs and SAEs are 
caused  by  an  imbalance  in  baseline  characteristics,  where  more  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
COPD  were  included  in  the  QVA149  group  by  chance.  The  reason  for  the  imbalance  in  baseline 
characteristics was that stratification was only based on smoking status according to CHMP guidelines. 
Furthermore  a  higher  discontinuation  rate  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group  leading  to  a  healthier 
population in the placebo group. 
In  order  to  assess  the  relative  risk  of  various  adverse  events  (such  as  ischemic  heart  disease, 
myocardial 
infarction,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  cardiac 
failure,  etc.)  among  new  users  of 
indacterol/glycopyrronium  with  COPD  compared  to  new  users  of  comparator  drugs  with  COPD,  the 
Applicant 
is 
requested 
to 
perform 
a 
post-authorisation 
safety 
study 
(PASS) 
of 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium in Europe (see section 2.8 ‘Risk Management Plan’ for further details). 
Regarding the difference in pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection between the QVA149 and 
placebo, an imbalance in the baseline characteristics was identified as the most likely cause in the Core 
12-month Safety database. In the Major 6-month and Exacerbation Safety database, these differences 
couldn’t be found. 
In  the  Exacerbation  Safety  database,  a  difference  in  the  event  rates  for  Upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  (URTI)  was  observed  between  QVA149  and  the  open  label  tiotropium  group.  The  Applicant 
argued that the difference is not clinically relevant and that the three treatment groups are similar for 
this AE of special interest and present event rates for the more general term URTI, which is constituted 
of all infection including bacterial. Looking at the Major 6-month Safety database, which is considered 
the  main  safety  database,  there  is  no  difference  between  placebo  and  QVA149.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
agrees  with  the  Applicant’s  conclusion  that  overall  there  is  no  indication  of  an  increased  risk  with 
QVA149.

As  to  the  overall  higher  number  of  SAEs  seen  in  favour  of  placebo,  the  Applicant  acknowledged  that 
this was due to an imbalance in baseline characteristics in study A2307. There were no differences in 
overall SAEs in the other safety databases.  
An imbalance was observed in respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders in patients over 75 years 
in the major 6-month safety database. The explanation from the Applicant that the number of subjects 
in  these  groups  is  very  low,  especially  in  the  placebo  group  is  acknowledged.  In  the  65  to  ≤75  year 
groups, which are larger, no clear differences are seen.  
In  the  Exacerbation  Safety  database,  7  patients  (1%)  with  acute  respiratory  failure  compared  with  6 
(0.8%) in the NVA237 group and 1 (0.1%) in the tiotropium group. The Applicant argues that none of 
the cases in all three groups could be considered related to the treatment. This is a patient population 
with  severe  COPD,  which  have  an  underlying  risk  of  acute  respiratory  failure  due  to,  e.g.  COPD 
exacerbation. The brief case narratives provided by the Applicant did not indicate a causal relationship 
with QVA149. 
Regarding  the  imbalance  observed  between  QVA149  and  placebo  in  the  Core  12-month  Safety 
database  with  regard  to  discontinuation  due  to  COPD  and  pneumonia,  the  CHMP  acknowledges  the 
Applicant’s explanation that the imbalance in baseline characteristics may explain the difference.   
Some small differences were observed with regard to haemoglobin and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but 
the  Applicant  provided  evidence  that  gives  no  reason  for  concern.  With  regard  to  haemoglobin,  the 
Applicant provided scientific literature that explains low haemoglobin in COPD patients. With regard to 
BUN, the observed differences were due to baseline imbalances. 
The  safety  data  also  showed  that  some  events  are  as  expected  at  higher  event  rates  and  are 
compatible with either beta-adrenergic or anticholinergic effect of QVA149, e.g. small increase in blood 
glucose.  
In  order  to  assess  the  characteristics  of  patients  being  newly  prescribed  indacterol/glycopyrronium 
with  a  specific  focus  on  the  prevalence  of  off-label  use,  and  of  conditions  associated  with  special 
warnings and precautions for Indacterol/glycopyrronium use, the Applicant will perform a multinational 
multi-database  drug  utilization  study  of  indacaterol/glycopyrronium  in  Europe  (see  section  2.8  ‘Risk 
Management Plan’). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The Applicant has satisfactorily addressed all of the concerns regarding safety in special populations. 
With regard to the age-related difference in AEs and SAEs, the Applicant provided data that showed 
episodes adjusted for exposure by age, where no relevant differences could be observed. Looking at 
the concern regarding respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders in ≥75 years, the Applicant 
argues that the numbers in the placebo group are too small to allow a meaningful conclusion. 
Furthermore, no differences were observed in the 65 to ≤75 year groups. Taking all this information 
into account, there is no indication of an increased risk related to the use of QVA149.  The SmPC 
and the risk management plan address satisfactorily the safety profile of the medicine.  
The Applicant will perform the following studies: 
- a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of indacaterol/glycopyrronium in Europe to assess the 
relative risk of various adverse events (such as ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction,

Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The benefits of the fixed combination of indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide at the dose 
of  110/50  microgram  in  the  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  in  adult 
patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  have  been  documented  in  an  adequate 
clinical  programme.  The  combination,  also  referred  to  as  QVA149,  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  treatment  effect  on  symptom  relief  (FEV1)  compared  to  placebo  and  active  comparators 
when  administrated  to  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  COPD.  The  treatment  effect  was  generally 
consistent across primary and secondary lung function efficacy endpoints and appears to be sustained 
over time up till 26 and 52 weeks. 
Clinically relevant differences to placebo have been shown for lung function measurements as well as 
for  the  dyspnoea  symptomatic  endpoint  (TDI).  In  the  placebo-controlled  clinical  study  (A2303), 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 94/99 
 
 
 
  
QVA149  showed  statistically  significant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  week  26  compared  with 
placebo. The treatment difference was 0.20 L (95% CI: 0.17-0.24 L).  
QVA149  also  showed  superiority  against  its  monocomponents  (QAB149  and  NVA237)  and  against 
another  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist,  tiotropium.  The  treatment  differences  were  0.07  L  (95% 
CI:  0.05-0.10  L),  0.09  L  (95%  CI:  0.06-0.11  L)  and  0.08  L  (95%  CI:  0.05-0.10  L),  respectively. 
Although the clinical relevance of these differences may be debated, in the context of being differences 
to active comparators they are considered to be clinically meaningful. In another pivotal study (2313), 
QVA149 was superior to fluticasone/salmeterol in FEV1 AUC0-12h at week 26. The treatment difference 
was 0.14 L (95% CI: 0.10-0.17 L). 
Further,  the  efficacy  shown  after  26  weeks  appears  to  be  maintained  in  the  long-term  (up  to  52 
weeks) as evidenced in the one-year study (A2307). 
Overall, the treatment effect appeared to be consistent irrespective of gender, age and smoking status 
and to a lesser extent FEV1 reversibility at baseline (see below). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
There are questions about the selected dose and dose regimen. These questions are related to issues 
identified  previously  for  each  of  the  monocomponents  during  or  after  their  licensing.  For  the 
indacaterol  component,  there  are  indications  that  half  of  the  dose  may  be  associated  with  similar 
efficacy  (and  potentially  less  safety  problems)  than  the  dose  tested  in  the  Xoterna  Breezhaler 
programme.  However,  it  appears  that  the  higher  dose  (150  µg)  is  associated  with  slightly  superior 
efficacy compared to half the dose with no significant disadvantage in terms of safety. Further, a study 
with glycopyrronium suggested that a twice-daily regimen (25 µg BID) confers better efficacy than the 
proposed  once-daily  regimen  (50  µg  OD).  The  latter  issue  will  be  addressed  as  part  of  an  RMP 
obligation for glycopyrronium bromide.  
The data provided by the applicant to support their claim of benefits of Xoterna Breezhaler in terms of 
reducing  exacerbations  have  not  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  in  order  to  support  a  specific 
exacerbation  indication.  In  the  dedicated  exacerbation  study  (2304),  the  rate  of  moderate  to  severe 
COPD  exacerbations  per  year  was  0.94  for  QVA149,  1.07  for  NVA237  and  1.06  for  tiotropium.  No 
specific exacerbation indication have been granted for any of the comparators in the EU/EEA, and the 
treatment  differences  to  the  comparators  are  very  small  and  only  achieved  statistical  significance 
(borderline)  for  the  NVA237  comparison.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  the  claimed  exacerbation 
indication not adequately justified and removed it from the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events observed in the clinical programme are considered to be typical of a moderately to 
severely  affected  COPD  population  except  for  the  2304  study  which  enrolled  patients  with  severe  to 
very severe COPD. 
As  expected  from  the pharmacological  profile of  QVA149,  symptoms  compatible  with  either  the beta-
adrenergic  or  anticholinergic  effect  such  as  urinary  retention  have  been  observed,  but  in  general  the 
event rates were low.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A higher incidence of atrial fibrillation/flutter and new onset first degree AV blocks are observed in the 
QVA149 group compared to the placebo group (Core 6-month Safety Database). Furthermore, a higher 
Xoterna Breezhaler  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/561242/2013 
Page 95/99 
 
  
proportion  of  patients  with  an  increase  in  QTc  of  30-60  ms  was  observed  with  QVA149  than  with 
tiotropium  (Exacerbation  Safety  Database).  In  addition,  a  higher  frequency  of  respiratory  infections 
and other respiratory events in the QVA149 group has been identified. 
The imbalance in atrial fibrillation/flutter and new onset AV block observed in the Core 6-month Safety 
database was addressed with data from the new All-COPD safety database that showed that the overall 
incidence  rates  are  in  general  similar.  There  were  no  events  in  the  placebo  group,  but  this  group  is 
rather small compared to the QVA149 group.  
In summary, the evidence provided by the Applicant showed that the imbalances in AEs and SAEs are 
caused  by  an  imbalance  in  baseline  characteristics,  where  more  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
COPD  were  included  in  the  QVA149  group  by  chance.  The  reason  for  the  imbalance  in  baseline 
characteristics was that stratification was only based on smoking status according to CHMP guidelines. 
Furthermore  a  higher  discontinuation  rate  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group  leading  to  a  healthier 
population in the placebo group. 
In  addition,  in  order  to  assess  the  relative  risk  of  various  adverse  events  among  new  users  of 
indacterol/glycopyrronium  with  COPD  compared  to  new  users  of  comparator  drugs  with  COPD,  the 
Applicant 
is 
requested 
to

(PASS) 
of 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium in Europe (see section 2.8 ‘Risk Management Plan’ for further details). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In  moderate-severe  COPD  patients,  the  treatment  difference  in  favour  of  QVA149  to  placebo  for  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint,  FEV1  at  week  26,  is  approximately  200  mL.  This  difference  is  clearly 
clinically  important,  and  the  relevance  of  the  finding  is  supported  by  the  vast  majority  of  secondary 
endpoints, both spirometric and symptomatic, with the possible exception of the health status endpoint 
(SGRQ).  However,  the  treatment  difference  to  the  active  comparators  is  considerably  less,  and  one 
may  debate  the  clinical  importance.  It  is  not  surprising  that  the  differences  to  the  active  treatments 
(including the monocomponents) are less, and the differences cannot be regarded as trivial as shown 
by  the  responder  analyses.  Eventually,  the  relevance  has  to  be  balanced  against  the  safety  and 
tolerability findings. 
There  appears  to  be  no  subpopulation  in  terms  of  COPD  severity  with  a  more  pronounced  effect  of 
QVA149  versus  its  monocomponents  compared  to  the  remaining  study  population.  The  incremental 
benefit  compared  to  the  monocomponents  and  tiotropium  is  largely  the  same  irrespective  of  COPD 
severity  and  whether  patients  received  prior  treatment  or  not  –  with  one  exception:  the  difference 
between QVA149 and QAB149 appeared larger in patients with prior treatment than in patients with no 
prior treatment. 
In  the  exacerbation  study  in  severe-very  severe  COPD  patients,  the  effect  on  reduction  of 
exacerbations compared to NVA237 and tiotropium is considered to be too small to support a specific 
exacerbation claim. 
The safety and tolerability profile of QVA149 is considered to be relatively benign and not significantly 
different  than  the  profile  of  the  individual  components.  Observed  adverse  events  where  a  causal 
relationship to QVA149 is likely (such as  symptoms compatible with adrenergic and/or anticholinergic 
effects) may be bothersome in some patients, but they do not occur frequently, are rarely severe and 
in most cases manageable.

Benefit-risk balance 
On the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted and the appropriate measures undertaken 
as  part of  the  RMP/Annex  II  conditions,  the  CHMP  considers that  there  is  a  favourable  benefit-to-risk 
balance  for  the  fixed  combination  of  indacaterol  maleate  and  glycopyrronium  bromide  at  the  dose  of 
110/50 microgram in the maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The favourable effects described above with regard to symptom relief are considered important in that 
QVA149 improves objective lung function measurements compared to placebo and that these changes 
are accompanied by symptomatic improvements in patients with COPD – a disease which by no means 
is  a  benign  illness.  Although  limited,  the  benefit  compared  to  that  observed  with  the  active 
comparators (indacaterol, glycopyrronium and tiotropium) is considered to be present and to outweigh 
the limited additional risk of QVA149 when compared to the risk of the mono-components. 
The  first-line  indication  has  been  discussed  by  the  CHMP.  The  current  GOLD  guideline  recommends 
combination  treatment  with  LABA  and  LAMA  as  an  option  if  symptoms  are  not  improved  with  single 
agents,  i.e.  combination  treatment  is  not  first  choice.  However,  given  the  relatively  benign  safety 
profile of QVA149 and the fact that QVA149 is numerically and in most cases also statistically superior 
to QAB149, NVA237 and tiotropium in all investigated subpopulations, it is not considered reasonable 
in the SmPC to restrict QVA149 to certain COPD patients, for example patients already treated with a 
LABA  (or  any  other  COPD  medicine)  with  an  unsatisfactory  response,  and  thereby  upfront  depriving 
treatment-naïve patients of the “full” bronchodilatory effect of combining a LABA with a LAMA. The fact 
that the GOLD guideline (published at a time when the results of the A2303 study were not publically 
available) does not recommend the combination of a LABA and a LAMA as first choice cannot in itself 
be a reason to restrict the indication to second-line. Consequently, the first-line indication is considered 
to be justified. 
In  terms  of  the  specific  exacerbation  claim,  this  is  not  justified  based  on  the  available  efficacy  data 
despite  assuming  a  very  benign  safety  and  tolerability  profile.  Therefore  the  exacerbation  claim  has 
been deleted from the indication. 
The adverse events observed in the clinical programme are considered to be typical of a moderately to 
severely  affected  COPD  population  except  for  the  2304  study  which  enrolled  patients  with  severe  to 
very severe COPD. 
As  expected  from  the pharmacological  profile of  QVA149,  symptoms  compatible  with  either  the beta-
adrenergic  or  anticholinergic  effect  such  as  urinary  retention  have  been  observed,  but  in  general  the 
event rates were low and not concerning.  
4.  Recommendations

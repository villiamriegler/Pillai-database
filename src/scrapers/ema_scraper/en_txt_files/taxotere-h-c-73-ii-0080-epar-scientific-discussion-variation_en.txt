Introduction 
Taxotere 20 and 80 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (INN: docetaxel) was first 
granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) under exceptional circumstances for a restricted indication 
(second line monotherapeutic treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer after anthracycline 
failure) in the EU in 1995.  
Taxotere is an antineoplastic agent (ATC code: L01CD02) that blocks cells in the M phase of the cell 
cycle  by  interfering  with  microtubule  structure  and  function.  Docetaxel  acts  by  promoting  the 
assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly, which leads to a marked 
decrease  of  free  tubulin.  The  binding  of  docetaxel  to  microtubules  does  not  alter  the  number  of 
protofilaments. 
Meanwhile, after the granting of a full MA and several amendments of the indication, Taxotere is 
indicated for the treatment of: 
Breast cancer 
- in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of 
patients with operable node- positive breast cancer. 
- in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after 
failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an 
alkylating agent. 
- in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast 
cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. 
- in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have 
included an anthracycline. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. 
- in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received 
chemotherapy for this condition. 
Prostate cancer 
- in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
- in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who 
have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Head and neck cancer 
- in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients 
with inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
This variation concerns an extension of indication for Taxotere (docetaxel) in head and neck cancer.

Head and neck cancer 
Squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN) represents 5% of newly diagnosed cancers in adult 
patients. Worldwide, more than 600 000 new cases are projected annually. There are wide differences 
in  incidence  according  to  geographical  region  and  gender.  Excessive  tobacco  and  alcohol 
consumption, and nutritional deficiencies are the risk factors for SCCHN. 
Various  anatomical  sites  with  specific  features  can  be  differentiated:  cancer  of  lip  and  oral  cavity, 
oropharyngeal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer of 
paranasal sinus and nasal cavity.   
SCCHN is a potentially curable malignancy when diagnosed at an early stage. Most patients present 
with advanced loco-regional disease, defined as either stage III (T3N0M0 or T1-3N1M0) or stage IV 
(T4N0-1M0 or T1-4N2-3M0).  
Prognosis  has  remained  poor  for  this  group  of  patients.  Between  50%  and  60%  will  develop  loco-
regional recurrence within 2 years, and 20% to 30% will develop distant metastases.   
The  terms  “unresectable”  or  "inoperable"  SCCHN  are  not  clearly  defined.  In  general,  SCCHN  is 
considered  as  unresectable  if  all  gross  tumour  cannot  be  removed  on  anatomic  grounds  or  if  local 
control cannot be achieved after an operation. Definitive surgery for intermediate- or advanced-stage 
disease within the larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx may lead to profound functional morbidity. 
The  experience  of  the  surgeon  and  the  support  available  strongly  influence  recommendations  for 
treatment.  
Patients having resectable tumours but who could also be adequately treated without surgery represent 
a very important group. In these individuals, definitive treatment with radiation therapy (RT) alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy may represent a preferable approach to resection in the interest of 
organ preservation.  
Advanced  SCCHN  includes  newly  diagnosed  but  unresectable  disease,  recurrent  disease,  and 
metastatic  disease.  The  treatment  goal  for  patients  with  newly diagnosed  but unresectable disease is 
cure.  In  the  past  decade  clinical  trials  investigated  alternative  radiotherapy  fractionation  schedules, 
concurrent  chemoradiotherapy,  and  novel  radiosensitizers  in  patients  with  unresectable  disease.  For 
patients with a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, the widely used treatment for newly diagnosed but 
unresectable disease is cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Until now there 
has  been  no  definitive  general  agreement  on  the  benefit  of  adding  induction  chemotherapy  to  loco-
regional  therapy  (radiation  alone  or  concomitant  chemo-radiation).  The  objective  of  induction 
chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) is to improve loco-regional disease control and eradicate 
potential distant metastases. Several induction chemotherapy trials have been conducted with different 
drugs  and  schedules,  with  mixed  results.  A  meta-analysis  showed  a  small  survival  benefit  with 
cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy with PF (Cisplatin 
(p)  100  mg/m²  day  1  and  5-FU  (F)  1000  mg/m²  by  continuous  infusion  day  1-5)  has  become  a 
standard regimen for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.  
Scope of the variation 
The scope of variation EMEA/H/C/0073/II/080 is an extension of the current indication in head and 
neck  cancer  which  was  approved  in  October  2006  based  on  the  European  TAX  323  study  (type  II 
variation II/70). In TAX 323, only inoperable patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck had been included (stage III-IV, all sites except nasopharynx, nasal and paranasal 
cavity).  Inoperability  was  determined  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  and  was  mainly  due  to 
unresectability. TAX 323 excluded technically operable patients who refused surgery and patients for 
organ preservation. 
The MAH has now applied to broaden the head and neck cancer indication as follows: 
“Taxotere (docetaxel) in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction 
treatment  of  patients  with  inoperable  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head  and 
neck.” 
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 3/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This  application  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  US  phase  III  study  TAX  324,  comparing  induction 
treatment with Docetaxel plus Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil (TPF) to treatment with Cisplatin plus 5-
Fluorouracil (PF). Both arms were followed by treatment with chemo-radiotherapy. The population of 
patients included those who are technically unresectable, those with low probability of surgical cure 
(<20%  chance  of  cure),  and  those  who  could  be  resected  but  wanted  to  maintain  function  (organ 
preservation) each group comprising approximately one third of the overall patient population.  
Further  changes  refer  to  SPC  sections  4.2  posology  and  method  of  administration,  4.8  undesirable 
effects, 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the SPC and to update 
the annexes in line with the latest QRD template. 
Non clinical aspects 
For the head and neck adenocarcinoma indication, no additional specific non clinical data have been 
provided, which is acceptable. All the previously submitted non clinical studies support this extension 
of indication, especially the 10-cycle toxicity and toxicokinetic studies undertaken in rat and dogs, 
which were conducted with the same regimen of administration as in the claimed indication.   
Clinical aspects 
GCP compliance 
The  clinical  programme  described  in  this  report  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical 
Practice  (GCP)  as  required  by  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonization  Guideline  for  Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH E6), 1 May 1996, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and standard 
operating procedures for clinical investigation and documentation in effect at the sponsor worldwide. 
The pivotal study was also carried out according to local legal requirements. 
This application has been formulated in compliance with the “Note for guidance on evaluation of anti-
cancer medicinal products in man” CPMP/EWP/205/95 Rev 2, July 2003. 
Clinical Pharmacology  
Reference is made to the pharmacokinetic interaction study, TAX 1001, submitted previously as part 
of variation II/67 for the gastric adenocarcinoma indication. TAX1001 was a pharmacokinetic 
interaction study of 75 mg/m² of docetaxel plus cisplatin 75 mg/m² and 5-FU 750 mg/m²/day for 5 
days in the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumours.  
The primary objective of this study was to determine in a randomized, cross-over setting (each patient 
being his own control), if there was any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between 
docétaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. 
Blood sampling procedures as well as analytical methods were adequate. The results did not suggest 
any interaction between drugs. Due to the study design the results provided information mostly on a 
low intrapatient variability for cisplatin and docetaxel. It would have been more appropriate to study 
the two treatments involved in the phase III trials (i.e. TPF versus PF). Despite that, pharmacokinetics 
interaction between docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin could be reasonably excluded due to the 
respective way of elimination for each drug:  
- docetaxel metabolised by CytP450 3A,  
- cisplatin: mainly urinary elimination, and nearly irreversible  binding to plasma proteins,  
- 5-fluorouracil catabolised by the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.

Follow-up
The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in the 2 treatment groups, and 
the main secondary objective was to compare Overall survival (OS). Patients received 4 cycles of 
chemotherapy every 3 weeks either: 
- Test group (TPF): Docetaxel 75mg/m2
750 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5, or 
- Control group (PF): Cisplatin 100 mg/m2
 Day 1, and 5-FU 1000 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5. 
 Day 1, cisplatin 75 mg/m2
 Day 1, and 5-FU 
Induction chemotherapy was followed by radiotherapy delivered, either with a conventional fraction 
regimen, or with an accelerated/hyperfractionated regimen, for a total dose of 70 to 74 Gray, 
respectively. Surgery to either the primary tumour or neck was permitted after chemotherapy and prior 
to initiation of radiation for patients without disease progression. Surgeries after radiotherapy were 
performed at the discretion of the local multidisciplinary team. Patients were followed until death. 
The ITT population included 358 patients. Treatment groups were comparable at the baseline for 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The most frequent tumor site was the oropharynx (46.1%) 
and the most frequent stag was T4/N2. The results of study TAX 323 are summarized in table 1.

Follow-up
TAX 324 was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, stratified, phase III study comparing two 
combination therapy regimens as induction treatment before chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced 
SCCHN. Patients were randomized to receive either the triple test therapy (TPF) or control treatment 
(PF), followed by chemoradiotherapy in both groups. 
Randomization was stratified upon 3 factors:  
- the primary tumor site (oral cavity versus oropharynx versus hypopharynx versus larynx);  
- the N stage (N0-1 versus N2-3);  
- the center. 
The first patient was randomized on 21 May 1999; the clinical cut-off for overall survival was the 3 
December 2005. 
The primary objective was to compare the overall survival (OS) after treatment with the test tri-
therapy (TPF: docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-FU) or the control treatment (PF: cisplatin plus 5-FU) 
followed by chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate and compare:  progression free survival (PFS), 
improvement of local symptoms; time-to-treatment failure (TTF); QoL; clinical complete response 
rate (CRR) and ORR (ORR = PR+CR) after induction chemotherapy and after loco-regional therapy 
(chemoradiotherapy); duration of response (CR and CR+PR); toxicity; and to evaluate the relationship 
of tumor markers and response to therapy. 
- 
Protocol amendments 
Five protocol amendments were performed: 
- Amendment 1 (March 1999): clarifications of the dose modification schedule, modification of the 
dosing regimen. 
- Amendment 2 (March 2000): addition of the following to secondary objectives: evaluate the 
relationship of tumor markers and response to therapy. An effort was to be made to reduce center 
variability in radiotherapy practices by employing a centralized reporting and consultation service; 
clarification of procedures for cytological assessment of tumor type and tumor response and clarified 
procedures for secondary analysis of tumor markers; of criteria for assessing toxicity and late radiation 
toxicity; of criteria and timing for removal of patients from therapy;

Page 6/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Amendment 3 (May 2001): changed the primary objective to OS, made PFS the main secondary 
endpoint, added complete response rate (CRR) after induction chemotherapy and overall response rate 
(ORR = partial response rate + complete response rate) after induction chemotherapy and after 
chemoradiotherapy as secondary endpoints, and removed organ preservation as a secondary endpoint. 
- Amendment 4 (March 2002): allow a pharmacokinetic study in selected patients (n=24) to evaluate 
pharmacokinetics in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
(SCCHN) who receive docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (TPF). 
- Amendment 5 (September 2003): increasing of the total sample size to 538 patients, to compensate 
for 38 patients excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.  
-

- WHO performance status of 0 or 1 
- Adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow functions. 
- 
Treatment regimen 
Induction treatment:  
Patients were to receive up to 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy at 3 week intervals. 
- Test group (TPF):  
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion, Day 1 
Cisplatin 100 mg/m2, administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour intravenous infusion on Day 1.  
5-FU was administered after cisplatin as a continuous intravenous infusion at 1000 mg/m2 per day 
Day1 to 4.  
- Control group (PF):  
Cisplatin 100 mg/m2, administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour intravenous infusion on Day 1 
5-FU continuous intravenous infusion at 1000 mg/m2 per day Day 1 to 5. 
Locoregional treatment: 
Chemoradiotherapy: chemoradiotherapy began 3 to 8 weeks after the start of the last cycle of 
induction chemotherapy. Patients had to fulfill the criteria to eligible for radiotherapy: adequate bone 
narrow function, complete resolution of mucositis for at least 1 week and healed dental procedures. 
- Chemotherapy: Carboplatin was to be given weekly as a one-hour infusion for a maximum of 7 
doses during radiation. The weekly carboplatin dose was to be calculated by the area under the curve 
(AUC) estimate of Calvert (AUC = 1.5) and was to be given on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
prior to the radiation treatment. Carboplatin was not to be administered if radiation was withheld.  
- Radiotherapy: The definitive therapy radiation dose to the site of the primary tumor was to be 
between 70 and 74 Gray in 2 Gray per day fractions delivered continuously 5 days per week with not 
intended treatment break.  
Surgery: Surgery for residual disease at the primary site and/or neck could be considered at any time 
following completion of chemoradiotherapy. Planned neck dissections were allowed based on the pre-
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 7/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment N stage and independent of response during treatment. The usual threshold for a planned 
neck dissection was N2a or greater disease at baseline. 
Prophylactic medications: 
Both treatment groups received prophylactic treatment.  
TPF arm: dexamethasone 8mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days starting day 5 of cycle 
Both arm: anti-emetics, G-CSF secondary prophylaxis allowed. 
- 
Endpoints  
Primary: Overall survival (OS) 
OS was measured from the date of randomization until death (regardless of the reason of death). 
If death or last contact did not occur before the cut-off date, the patient was censored at the cut-off 
date or last contact date if the patient was lost-to follow-up before the cut-off date. 
Secondary: Progression-free survival (PFS), Time to treatment failure (TTF), Overall response rate 
(ORR), duration of response and pathological response 
PFS was the main secondary endpoint and was calculated from the date of randomization up to the 
date of progression or the date of death (all reasons), whichever occurred first. If progression or death 
did not occur before the cut-off date (or occurred after the cut-off date), the patient was censored at the 
last valid assessment date before the cut-off date (at the cut-off date otherwise). 
TTF was calculated from the date of randomization up to the date of failure (progression, recurrence, 
death, withdrawal due to adverse event, patient's refusal, or lost to follow-up before treatment 
completion). If none of these events occurred before the cut-off date (or occurred after the cut-off 
date), the patient was censored at the date of last valid assessment before cut-off date, (at the cut-off 
date otherwise). Patients lost to follow-up after the end of the treatment were censored at the date of 
the last contact if it occurred before cut-off date; at the cut-off date otherwise. 
ORR: the response rate is defined, for each treatment arm, as the percentage of patients in the arm who 
achieve a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) according to the WHO criteria taking into 
account all assessments performed before any concomitant anti-cancer therapy. Responses calculated 
by the investigator after induction chemotherapy (ORR-CT), after chemoradiotherapy (ORR-CRT), 
and overall after study treatment completion (BOR) were used in the analyses. 
Of note, the centralised assessment of tumour response was cancelled within protocol amendment 3 
because response rate became a secondary endpoint.  
Duration of response (PR + CR) was also calculated from the date of randomization up to the first 
progression in the responders for the whole treatment (induction chemotherapy plus 
chemoradiotherapy). If progression or death did not occur before the cut-off date/further anti-cancer 
therapy (or occurred after the cut-off date), the patient was censored at the last valid assessment date 
before the cut-off date/further anti-cancer therapy date (at the cut-off date otherwise). The duration of 
complete response (CR) was calculated from the date the complete response was documented up to the 
documentation of first progression. 
Pathological response at the primary site was evaluated by performing an optional biopsy of the 
primary tumour in patients willing and able to undergo pathological confirmation of the response. 
Evaluation under anesthesia and optional biopsy were to be performed in responders only (CR and 
PR). The pathologic complete response rate is the percentage of patients with a negative biopsy for 
residual disease at primary site among the patients actually biopsied. 
Quality of life and clinical benefit 
The quality of life assessment was made using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head 
and Neck quality of life instrument (FACT-HN version 4.0), the Performance Status Scale for Head 
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 8/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Neck (PSS-HN), a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
performance status score. Evaluations were made before randomisation, after two cycles, at the end of 
chemotherapy before starting radiotherapy, at six and nine months post end of radiotherapy. The 
consumption of analgesics was also assessed. 
Of note, protocol amendment 3 removed organ preservation as a secondary endpoint.  
- 
Sample size 
For the primary endpoint, OS, a hazard ratio of 0.65 (assumed median OS of 43 months in the TPF 
treatment group and 28 months in the PF treatment group) could be detected with a 91% power using 
a 2-sided log-rank test at a 5% significance level with 436 patients (218 per arm) recruited in 30 
months. To achieve this statistical hypothesis, the minimum follow-up is 24 months, and a total of 227 
events are needed. A maximum of 500 patients were to be recruited (250 per arm), assuming that 
approximately 15% of patients will be lost-to-follow-up or early dropouts in this study. 
PFS was the main secondary endpoint. The null hypothesis of no difference in PFS between 
treatments was tested using the log-rank test at an overall 2-sided 5% significance level. To achieve 
approximately 90% power, given a true median PFS for the control arm of 10 vs. 15 months for the 
test arm, a total of 256 events are needed. With 218 patients per arm enrolled per treatment group, a 
minimal follow-up of 3 months and 30 months of accrual (i.e., 18 months median follow-up) are 
needed to achieve this main secondary endpoint. 
By protocol amendment 5, the total sample size was increased to 538 patients, to compensate for 38 
patients excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. 
- 
Statistical methods 
Treatment group comparability at baseline was assessed with respect to the following factors: 
• Patient characteristics at baseline: age, gender, WHO performance status, reason of inoperability, 
clinical symptoms, laboratory values. 
• Tumour characteristics at inclusion: primary tumour site (oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, oral 
cavity), TNM stage at first diagnosis, combination of T and N stage, histopathological grade, number 
and type of organs involved, time from first histopathological diagnosis to randomization. 
Five different populations were defined: 
- The intent-to-treat population (ITT) consisted of all randomised subjects, except 37 patients 
incorrectly randomised and one patient with GCP compliance issues, analyzed in the treatment group 
to which they were assigned to by randomisation. 
- The chemoradiotherapy safety population (CRSP) consisted of all subjects treated with at least one 
cycle of study therapy and analysed according to the study medication actually received. 
- The radiotherapy safety population (RSP) consisted of all subjects receiving chemoradiotherapy, 
analysed according to the chemotherapy actually received. 
- Patients who satisfied the following condition were evaluable for response: at least two cycles of 
induction chemotherapy and at least one disease assessment with the same imaging procedure for each 
lesion as at baseline. If progression occurred before the second cycle, the patient was considered as 
evaluable and reported as early progression. 
- The per protocol population included all ITT patients who were eligible, evaluable for response, and 
who did not have any major deviation during study are included in the per protocol population. 
In order to evaluate the consistency of results, sensitivity analyses were performed on all randomized 
patients (still excluding the one patient with GCP compliance issues). 
Tests used 
A 2-sided 5% significance level was applied to all tests. 
Time to event data were described using Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates. Confidence intervals 
were calculated for the median survival time using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley and for 
hazard ratios using the Cox model. Groups were compared with log-rank and Wilcoxon tests and in 
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 9/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cox proportional hazards models. For multivariate analysis, the following baseline items were fitted to 
the model: country, oral cavity primary, oropharynx primary, hypopharynx primary, N stage. 
Unadjusted Chi-square tests were used to compare treatment arms for categorical variables unless the 
expected cell frequency was < 5, in which case an exact test was used, e.g., Fisher’s exact test. 
Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for binary event rates. 
Repeated measures data were analyzed with a method appropriate for the type of data and the missing 
data mechanism. If data were missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR), 
normally distributed data were analysed with a mixed model, and ordered categorical data were 
analysed with a generalized mixed model or with generalized estimating equations. If data are not 
missing at random (NMAR), a random-coefficient pattern mixture model was used with stratification 
on the pattern of missing data or the reason for drop-out. 
Follow-up 
The patients were followed until death or study completion, up to 2 years after the randomization of 
the last patient.

Efficacy results 
There were 539 patients randomized in the study, the ITT population excluded 37 patients incorrectly 
randomized and 1 patient with GCP compliance. So there were 501 patients randomized, enrolled in 
55 sites in 6 countries, over 54.3 months.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary endpoint was overall survival in the ITT population, using a log-rank test. OS was 
measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for any cause.  
At the cut-off date, 234 of the 501 patients had died (46.7%): 40.8% in the TPF arm and 52.8% in the 
PF arm, as shown in table 4 and figure 2.

Cox model 
Center effect 
- 
The potential effect of stratification factors of randomization (primary tumor site, N stage and center) 
have been investigated using a Cox proportional hazard model. 
The treatment effect was statistically significant (p=0.0018) with a 34% risk reduction of mortality in 
the TPF arm compared to PF arm. Two factors of randomisation were statistically significant (p=0.009 
for primary tumour site and p<0.0001 for the geographical area). The N stage wasn’t statistically 
significant (p=0.0781). Similar results were obtained after analysis was performed on the stratification 
factors as recorded in the CRF after validation. 
- 
55 centers in six countries enrolled patients in the study. The number of centers by country ranged 
from 1 center to 42 centers. The number of patients by centre ranged from 1 patient to 73 patients. In 
the cox model, centers have been pooled by geographical area. 
The consistency of OS across countries or centre size was examined and demonstrated a wide overlap 
of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio, indicating consistent results across the centres and the geographical 
area. The results of centres size (small/large) and geographical area were consistent with the overall 
results in favouring TPF. 
- 
The consistency of OS across primary tumour sites was examined in the ITT population. It 
demonstrated a wide overlap of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio, indicating consistent results across the 
primary tumour site. A trend toward significance in favour of TPF (upper CI limits close to 1) was 
observed for patients with oropharynx and larynx primary tumour site (HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.47-1.03, 
and HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.32-1.04, respectively). 
- 
A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate patients lost to follow-up (TPF: 5.9%; PF: 5.7%) 
having had an event. TPF treatment was associated with a 28% (95% CI, 0.09 TO 0.44) risk 
reduction in mortality compared to PF (P=0.0067). 
Subgroup analysis by primary tumor site 
Patient lost to follow-up 
Secondary efficacy endpoint: Progression-free survival 
PFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of progression or the date of death for 
any reasons. At the cut-off date, 125 patients (49%) in the TPF treatment group and 153 patients 
(62.2%) in the PF treatment group had developed a progression (37.6 % TPF vs. 47.2% PF) or are 
died (11.4% TPF vs. 15% PF).

Figure 3-Progression-free survival – Kaplan-Meier curve (ITT) 
PFS was significantly higher in the TPF treatment group than in the PF treatment group. There was a 
29% progression risk reduction for the TPF treatment group compared to the PF treatment group 
(HR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.90; p=0.004). Median PFS was 35.5 months in the TPF treatment group 
(95% CI: 19.3-NA) and 13.1 months in the PF treatment group (95% CI: 10.6-20.2), representing a 
22-month improvement. Survival estimates at 2 years were 53.2% for the TPF treatment group 
compared to 41.7% for the PF treatment group. 
Tumour assessments were to be performed in both treatment groups at the end of Cycles 2 and 3, 6 to 
12 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, and on follow-up visits until disease progression or 
death. Most tumour assessments were performed at the protocol-specified time points and were 
balanced between treatment groups. Overall, the progression endpoint was evaluated sooner in the 
TPF treatment group than in the PF treatment group. However, the positive treatment effect of TPF on 
PFS could not be attributed to tumour assessment timing. 
Sensitivity analyses 
When censoring for non-tumour related deaths, the difference between treatment groups showed a 
31% progression risk reduction for the TPF treatment group compared to the PF treatment group 
(HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.89; p=0.004). 
When censoring for further therapies, the difference between treatment groups indicated a 33% 
progression risk reduction for the TPF treatment group compared to the PF treatment group (HR=0.67, 
95% CI: 0.52-0.85; p=0.0013).

Duration of the response 
Median duration of response was not reached in the TPF treatment group; it was 41.9 months (95% 
CI: 19.2-NA) in the PF treatment group. The difference between treatment groups was statistically 
significant, with HR=0.67 (95% CI: 0.48-0.93; p=0.018).

Time to treatment failure 
Observations of lost to follow-up after the end of treatment were censored. At the cut-off date, 60.7% 
of the ITT population had experienced a treatment failure, independent of treatment: Progressive 
disease was the main cause of an event (39.9%) in both treatment groups. 
Median TTF was longer in the TPF treatment group (20.5 months; 95% CI: 12.6-39.4) than in the PF 
treatment group (10.8 months; 95% CI: 8.7-13.8). The difference between treatment groups was 
statistically significant with HR=0.74 (95% CI: 0.59-0.93; P=0.0102).

Analysis of efficacy by subgroup (gender, age and race) 
Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effects of gender, age and race on measures of 
efficacy. As shown in the description of the population the majority of patients were male, Caucasian 
and less than 65 years.  
Quality of life and clinical benefit 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT-HN) 
At least one evaluable quality of life assessment was obtained in 83.9% and 85.8% of TPF and PF 
patients, respectively. These percentages decreased with time from 96.8% at baseline to 30.5% at the 
end of treatment and over. 
The analysis was made on the material from the 420 patients (209 in TPF arm and 211 in PF arm) who 
completed at least baseline assessment and one evaluable on-study assessment. No statistical 
difference was found between treatment groups (P=0.46). At baseline, the QLQ-H&N35 mean score 
was similar in the two treatment groups (24.1 in TPF, 24.2 in PF). The score improved at most by 2.4 
points in the TPF treatment group and 1.7 points in the PF treatment group during the chemotherapy 
time windows. Similar conclusions applied to the Emotional Well Being score and the FACT-G score. 
Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck (PSS-HN) 
At baseline, almost all patients completed the PSS-HB assessment. The percentages decreased with 
time to approximately 60% at the end of treatment and over. Given the low compliance of the scale 
during follow-up, the mixed models applied on each subscale were limited to the first two time 
windows, corresponding to the induction chemotherapy treatment. 
No statistically significant difference between treatment groups was found for the “Eating in public” 
and “Normalcy of diet” subscales (p=0.09 for both scales). In both treatment groups, the score did not 
vary clearly over time and was approximately 80. 
The difference between treatment groups was significant for the “Understandability of speech” scale 
(p= 0.0196). However, when adjusting on multiplicity testing, the difference was borderline (p=0.06). 
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 19/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At baseline, the “Understandability of speech” means score was similar in the two treatment groups 
(89.1 in TPF, 89.8 in PF). The score in both treatment groups improved during treatment: 5.6 points in 
the TPF arm and 2.0 points in the PF arm during the chemotherapy time windows. 
Pain intensity 
It was evaluated with a visual analog scale, and it was associates with analgesic consumption. Overall, 
compliance over time of the pain intensity VAS was similar in the two treatment groups, with a 
significant decrease at the follow-up time points compared to end of chemotherapy in both treatment 
groups.  
Given the low compliance of the scale during follow-up, the mixed models applied on each subscale 
were limited to the first two time windows, corresponding to the induction chemotherapy treatment. 
The difference between treatment groups were not statistically significant (p=0.14). Baseline intensity 
score was 25.6 in the TPF treatment group (n=209) versus 24.5 in the PF treatment group (n=201). In 
both treatment groups, pain intensity score was improved by at most 15.9 points in the TPF treatment 
group and 13.1 points in the PF treatment group during the chemotherapy time windows. 
Most patients in both treatment groups (73.7% in TPF, 70.3% in PF) reported using analgesics at study 
entry (mainly of opioids). During induction chemotherapy, 81.6% of patients in the TPF treatment 
group and 83.7% in the PF treatment group received at least one analgesic, consisting mainly of 
opioids (about 65% in both treatment groups). However, the percentage of patients consuming 
analgesics during the induction chemotherapy treatment decreased from 70% to 60% in both treatment 
groups at the end of Cycle 3. During chemoradiotherapy, the percentage of patients with analgesics 
increased to 70% in the TPF treatment group and 66% in the PF treatment group. 
Pharmacokinetic study  
Pharmacokinetic studies were made for docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU. For analysis plasma sample 
were taken from 4 patients (3 in TPF treatment group and 1 in PF control group). Docetaxel and 
cisplatin concentrations were assessed in 3 patients and 5-FU concentration in 4 patients. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
Pharmacokinetics 
Docetaxel  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  for  3  patients  in  the  TPF  treatment  group, 
cisplatin parameters were calculated for 2 patients in the TPF treatment group and 1 patient in the PF 
treatment group, and 5-FU parameters were calculated for 3 patients in the TPF treatment group and 1 
patient in the PF treatment group. Although data were limited, values for pharmacokinetic parameters 
of all 3 drugs were in the expected range. 
Clinical efficacy 
TAX  324  was  a  prospective,  non-blinded,  randomized,  controlled,  phase  III  trial  comparing  TPF 
(Taxotere,  cisplatin,  and  5-fluorouracil)  with  PF  (cisplatin,  and  5-fluorouracil)  as  induction  regimen 
before  chemoradiation  for  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  cancer  of  the  head  and  neck.  In  the 
predominantly US-based multicenter phase III study, 538 patients with histologically or cytologically 
proven  locally  advanced  SCCHN  were  included.  The  population  of  patients  included  those  who  are 
technically unresectable, those with low probability of surgical cure (<20% chance of cure), and those 
who  could  be  resected  but  wanted  to  maintain  function  (organ  preservation)  each  group  comprising 
approximately one third of the patient population.  
Patients  were  to  receive  3  cycles  of  induction  chemotherapy  unless  progression,  unacceptable 
toxicity or patient refusal at the following dosing schedule, which was given every 3 weeks: 
1  TPF:  Taxotere  75  mg/m²  as  1-hour  IV  infusion  followed  by  cisplatin  100  mg/m²  as  30-min  to  3-
hour IV infusion on day 1. 5-FU followed as a continuous IV infusion at 1000 mg/m² per day on days 
1-4 days. 
2 
IV infusion at 1000 mg/m² per day 1 for 5 days. 
PF: Cisplatin 100 mg/m² as 30-min to 3-hour IV infusion on day 1. 5-FU followed as a continuous


 
 
 
After  the  end  of  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  locoregional  therapy  with  chemoradiation  including 
carboplatin as a radiosensitizer had to be started within 3 to 8 weeks. Radiation was to be delivered 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gray [Gy] x 1/day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks). Carboplatin was 
given  weekly  as  a  1-hour  infusion  for  a  maximum  of  7  doses  according  to  the  radiation  schedule. 
Surgery for resectable primary and/or nodal metastatic disease at the primary site and/or neck were 
allowed at any time following completion of chemoradiotherapy.  
Patients  were  stratified  for  the  participating  centre,  according  to  primary  tumour  site  (oral  cavity 
versus hypopharynx versus larynx) and stage (N0–1 vs. N2-3). From the baseline characteristics and 
tumour characteristics the two treatment groups are comparable. The vast majority of patients received 
chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy as outlined in the protocol.  
The results for the primary endpoint OS and for the secondary endpoints PFS and response rate are all 
in favour of treatment with TPF with HR= 0.70[0.54-0.9] for OS (Fig. 1) and HR=0.71[0.56-0.9] for 
PFS. The difference in median length of OS is 40.5 months, the difference in median length in PFS is 
22.4 months, and the difference in overall response rate at the end of study treatment approximately 
2.3%. Due to the high rate of censoring after 24 months and the median length of follow-up of 41.9 
months, the survival estimates beyond the median follow-up time should be interpreted with caution 
(Table 1). 
Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier curves – overall survival and progression-free survival 
The  p-values  of  both  log-rank  tests  were  significant:  p=0.0058  for  OS  and  p=0.004  for  PFS.  The 
results  for  the  overall  response  rate  are  only  marginally  significant  after  induction  therapy  (p=0.07)

and  no  longer  significant  at  the  end  of  study  treatment  (p=0.593).  Duration  of  response  was 
significantly  longer  in  the  subgroup  of  responders  of  the  TFP  group.  Time  to  treatment  failure  was 
also significantly longer in the TPF arm. 
Table 1 Summary statistics for overall survival  
Table 2 Summary statistics for progression free survival 
Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires and 3 instruments for the measurement of clinical benefit were 
used. Compliance with the instruments decreased over time, it was unacceptably low for the follow-up 
time-points.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  groups  concerning  QoL 
parameters neither at baseline nor during study treatment. Pain intensity improved during treatment in 
both groups indicating adequate pain management in both treatment groups. 
Overall, the efficacy results of study TAX 324 are convincing in terms of clinically relevant and 
statistically significant decreased risk of death (OS) and of progression (PFS). 
All provided post hoc analyses within the response document, further confirm the superiority of TPF 
vs. PF in various settings across the included population. The overall treatment plan with radio-
chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy and surgery if considered medically appropriate reflects 
current clinical practice. Study TAX 324 confirms the benefit of induction treatment with TPF in 
patients with inoperable locally advanced head and neck cancer. Exploratory subgroup analyses with 
patients aiming at organ preservation also resulted in a survival benefit with the docetaxel containing 
triple drug induction as compared to the two drug regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil).  
EMEA/27448/2008 0.1, CURRENT 
Page 22/32 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The induction chemotherapy comparator regimen is well recognised. At the time of the initiation of 
Study TAX 324, reference chemotherapy treatment in this neoadjuvant setting of SCCHN was 
cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2. However, it is worth noting that the CRT 
regimen used in study TAX 324 must be considered as suboptimal. More intensive chemotherapy is 
usually used for a CRT based regimen (cisplatin 100mg/m2). However, section 5.1 of the SPC 
adequately describes the design, treatment and outcome of study TAX 324, including a description of 
the CRT regimen used in the pivotal trial. 
In the context of locally advanced head and neck cancer, it is important to highlight the difference 
between inoperable patients (in whom surgery is technically impossible or not indicated) and patients 
in whom surgical resection is not accepted. In the first setting, organ preservation is not an option and 
surgery is simply not feasible. In the second one, surgery is theoretically possible and could be the 
most efficient solution if the aim is prolongation of OS (there are no data contradicting this 
hypothesis).  
The fact that organ preservation was not addressed in the TAX 324 study, is mentioned specifically in 
section 5.1 of the SPC in order to prevent the promotion of abstention from surgery in patients who are 
in principle operable. It is furthermore possible, that a trial comparing a chemotherapeutic regimen 
with a surgical approach is not feasible due to patient’s preference. In this context, it is important to 
note that the results of the TAX 324 trial confirm that in both the overall patient population as well as 
in patients aiming at organ preservation and who are not operated, TPF is superior to PF.  
Therefore, with reference to the wording of section 4.1 of the SPC, both the inclusion criteria of the 
TAX  324  study  and  the  favourable  results  for  the  TPF  group  justify  the  deletion  of  the  word 
“inoperable” from the current indication in head and neck cancer.  
Clinical safety 
Study TAX324 
 - 
Patient exposure 
A total of 494 patients received study treatment in TAX324 and comprise the safety population, 
including 251 TPF-treated patients and 243 PF-treated patients. The safety analysis focused on the 
treated safety population. 
The chemoradiotherapy safety population (CRSP) included 202 TPF patients and 184 PF patients. 
Exposure to induction chemotherapy 
In both treatment groups, the majority of patients received the protocol-specified 3 cycles of induction 
chemotherapy (84.1% of patients in the TPF treatment group and 81.9% of patients in the PF 
treatment group). 
In the TPF treatment group, there were fewer patients with 1 or more cycle delays (29.1%) than in the 
PF treatment group (64.6%). Considering all patients, the most frequent reason for cycle delay was 
hematological toxicity, but only in the PF treatment group (44.4%, compared to 4.4% in the TPF 
treatment group).   
Considering dose reduction, 21.9% of patients in the TPF treatment group and 25.9% of patients in the 
PF treatment group had at least 1 dose reduction. The most frequent reason for dose reduction in both 
treatment groups was non-hematological toxicities (TPF:  14.7%; PF:  19.8%). 
Exposure to chemoradiotherapy 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups of TAX324 received protocol-defined 
chemoradiotherapy (TPF 80.5%, PF 75.7%).  In both treatment groups, the median duration of 
chemoradiotherapy was 7 weeks, and the median total dose of radiotherapy was 70.0 Gray. The 
median RDI of carboplatin during chemoradiotherapy was very high and similar across treatment 
groups.

Treatment-emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) 
Overview of TEAEs during chemotherapy 
The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE, both regardless of relationship to study 
treatment and possibly or probably related to study treatment, respectively, were 99.6% and 98.4% in 
the TPF treatment group and 99.2% and 97.1% in the PF treatment group.  The frequency of Grade 4 
events, regardless of relationship to study treatment, was 27.9% in the TPF treatment group and 24.7% 
in the PF treatment group.  The frequency of drug-related Grade 4 events was 24.3% in the TPF 
treatment group and 20.6% in the PF treatment group.

TEAEs regardless of relationship 
The incidences by patient of TEAEs -regardless of relationship- were similar in the 2 treatment groups 
for most NCIC CTG categories (National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group), with only 
the skin category having a >10% difference in any grade TEAE between the 2 treatment groups 
(TPF:  78.5%; PF:  63.8%). 
During chemotherapy the 5 most frequent NCIC CTG terms for TEAEs (all grades, regardless of 
relationship to study treatment, in either treatment group) occurring in more than 50% of patients were 
nausea (TPF:  76.5%; PF:  79.8%), alopecia (TPF:  67.7%; PF:  43.6%), stomatitis (TPF:  65.7%; PF:  
67.5%), lethargy (TPF:  61.4%; PF:  55.6%), and vomiting (TPF:  56.2%; PF:  62.6%). 
TEAEs related to treatment 
The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG categories, related to study treatment, with 
only the system “skin” having a >10% difference in incidence by patient for any grade TEAE between 
the 2 treatment groups (TPF:  72.5%; PF:  57.2%). Related TEAE categories of gastrointestinal and 
flu-like symptoms had Grade 3/4 TEAEs with a frequency of >10% in either treatment group 
(gastrointestinal: TPF:  43.0%; PF:  38.3%; flu-like symptoms: TPF:  7.6%; PF:  12.8%).  These same 
2 categories (gastrointestinal and flu-like symptoms) were the only categories with >3% difference in 
Grade 3/4 TEAEs between the 2 treatment groups.

The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG terms related to study treatment (all grades). 
The most frequent related TEAEs occurring in more than 50% of patients were nausea (TPF:  75.7%; 
PF:  78.2%), alopecia (TPF:  67.7%; PF:  43.2%), stomatitis (TPF:  64.5%; PF:  67.1%), lethargy 
(TPF:  58.6%; PF:  51.0%), and vomiting (TPF:  56.2%; PF:  60.9%).  Only alopecia had a >10% 
difference between the 2 treatment groups.  TEAE terms of nausea and stomatitis had Grade 3/4 
TEAEs with a frequency of >10% in either treatment group (nausea: TPF:  13.9%; PF:  13.6%; 
stomatitis:  TPF:  20.7%; PF:  27.2%, anorexia:  TPF: 12.0%; PF:  11.1%, 
esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia:  TPF:  12.0%; PF:  7..4%).  Of the 4 Grade 3/4 related TEAE 
terms with >3% difference in incidence between the 2 treatment groups, 2 were more frequent in the 
TPF treatment group:  diarrhea (TPF:  6.8%; PF:  3.3%) and esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia 
(TPF:  12.0%; PF:  7.4%) and 2 were more frequent in the PF treatment group:  stomatitis 
(TPF:  20.7%; PF:  27.2%) and lethargy (TPF:  4.0%; PF:  9.9%).   
The following related TEAEs occurred in <5% of patients but were considered to be clinically 
meaningful given the known safety profiles of docetaxel, cisplatin, or 5-FU:  dysrhythmias 
(TPF:  3.2%; PF:  2.1%), myocardial ischemia (TPF:  0.8%; PF:  0.4%), gastrointestinal bleeding 
(TPF:  2.0%; PF:  1.2%), hay fever (TPF:  2.4%; PF:  1.6%), conjunctivitis/keratitis (TPF:  0.8%; PF:  
0.0%), and tearing (TPF:  1.6%; PF:  1.6%). Of these, Grade 3/4 related TEAEs were seen for 
dysrhythmias (TPF:  2.0%; PF:  1.6%), myocardial ischemia (TPF:  0.8%; PF:  0.4%), gastrointestinal 
bleeding (TPF:  0.4%; PF:  0.4%), and hay fever (TPF:  0.4%; PF:  0.0%). 
TEAEs during chemoradiotherapy 
The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE, both regardless of relationship to study 
treatment and possibly or probably related to study treatment, were similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG categories related to study treatment, with 
no NCIC CTG category having a >10% difference between treatment groups.  There were 2 Grade 3/4 
TEAE categories having a >3% difference in incidence between the 2 treatment groups:  
gastrointestinal (TPF:  48.5%; PF:  53.3%), which was more frequent in the PF treatment group, and 
skin (TPF:  12.9%; PF:  9.8%), which was more frequent in the TPF treatment group.   
The 2 treatment groups were similar for most NCIC CTG terms (all grades) related to study treatment. 
The most frequent related TEAEs occurring in more than 50% of patients were stomatitis 
(TPF:  81.7%; PF:  84.8%), esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia (TPF:  63.4%; PF:  60.3%), and 
mouth/nose dryness (TPF:  53.5%; PF:  51.6%).  The terms with Grade 3/4 related TEAEs occurring 
in >10% of patients in both treatment groups were stomatitis (TPF:  36.1%; PF:  37.5%) and 
esophagitis/dysphagia/odynophagia (TPF:  21.8%; PF:  21.2%).  Anorexia (TPF:  8.4%; PF:  13.0%) 
was the only Grade 3/4 TEAE term with >3% difference in incidence between the 2 treatment groups.

Deaths on study 
Of the 494 treated patients, 103 (41.0%) TPF-treated patients and 130 (53.5%) PF-treated patients 
died.  Progression of disease was the main cause of death in both treatment groups (TPF:  28.7%; PF:  
40.7%) and occurred more than 30 days after the last study treatment in all but one (PF-treated) 
patient.  Toxic death was observed in 2 TPF-treated patients, one occurring 154 days after the last

study treatment, and in 4 PF-treated patients, one occurring 57 days after the last study treatment.  The 
“other” category consisted mostly of adverse events not related to study treatment, and in 8 patients (5 
in TPF, 3 in PF), death of unknown cause.

Both with and without chemoradiotherapy, the most common reason for death was progressive 
disease:  38.8% and 55.9% for TPF- and PF-treated patients, respectively, who did not receive 
chemoradiotherapy, and 26.2% and 35.9% for TPF- and PF-treated patients, respectively, who 
received chemoradiotherapy.   
Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment  
Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment from non-malignant cause (i.e., due to “toxicity” or 
“other”) were more frequent in the PF treatment group (12 patients, 4.9%) than in the TPF treatment 
group (4 patients, 1.6%).   
A quarter of the deaths in both treatment groups (TPF:  1 of 4 deaths; PF:  3 of 12 deaths) were 
reported as toxic deaths by the investigator. 
Infection was the most common AE leading to a non-malignant cause of death within 30 days of the 
last study treatment, with 1 patient in the TPF treatment group and 3 patients in the PF treatment group 
who had infection-associated deaths. 
Deaths more than 30 days after last study treatment  
Overall, 217 patients (43.9%) died at least 30 days after the last study treatment:  99 in the TPF 
treatment group (39.4%) and 118 in the PF treatment group (48.6%). 
Of these 217 deaths, 11 were due to AEs (with onset prior to 30 days after the last study treatment, or 
considered related):  6 in the TPF treatment group and 5 in the PF treatment group. 9/11 were assessed 
as not related to the study treatment. 
- 
Withdrawal due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs occurred in 10.2% of TPF patients and in 8.5% of PF 
patients, with no particular AE leading to discontinuation.

Laboratory safety data 
Hematological evaluation: 
Anemia of any grade occurred frequently (88% of patients overall), and the incidence was comparable 
for both treatment groups. Grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 12.4% of patients in the TPF group and 9.5% 
in the PF group. 
Leukopenia of any grade occurred in 92.8% of patients in the TPF group and 79.8% of patients in the 
PF group regardless of the use of G-CSF. Grade 3/4 leukopenia was also more frequent in the TPF 
group (54.2%) than in the PF group (23.5%), with the majority of these being Grade 3 leukopenia. 
Neutropenia of any grade was more frequent among patients in the TPF group (94.8%) than in the PF 
group (84.2%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was also more frequent in the TPF group (83.5%) than in the 
PF group (56.0%), regardless the use of G-CSF.

Prophylactic G-CSF was given to a total of 68 evaluable patients (13.8%), limiting assessment of 
benefit.  
The percentage of patients with any grade thrombocytopenia was similar in the TPF treatment group 
(27.5%) and in the PF treatment group (30.9%). Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was more frequent in the 
PF group (10.7%) than in the TPF group (4.0%). 
Serum chemistry: 
Abnormalities of creatinine clearance occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups (all 
grades:  TPF:  20.9%; PF:  20.2%).  
The parameters of any grade reported with a difference >10% were hypomagnesemia (TPF:  61.4%; 
PF:  42.8%) and hypocalcemia (TPF:  36.7%; PF:  24.9%), both of which were more frequent in the 
TPF treatment group than in the PF treatment group.  
Grade 3/4 abnormalities reported with a difference >3% were hypomagnesemia (TPF:  6.3%; PF:  
2.8%) and hypocalcemia  (TPF:  12.7%; PF:  6.6%).   
Hypomagnesemia 
Grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia was reported in 14 (6.3%) patients in the TPF treatment group versus 6 
(2.8%) patients in the PF treatment group.  Hypomagnesemia has been reported in patients treated 
with platinum compounds. 
Hypocalcemia 
Grade 3/4 hypocalcemia was reported in 31 (12.7%) patients in the TPF treatment group versus 15 
(6.6%) patients in the PF treatment group.  In the cancer patient population, hypocalcemia is 
frequently seen in association with hypoalbuminemia (for example, in presence of malnutrition).  
Because calcium is bound to albumin, low albumin levels result in artifactually lower laboratory 
calcium values.  Furthermore, magnesium levels, often low in poor nutritional settings, could also 
contribute to decreased calcium levels.  Albumin levels were reported in 21 patients in the TPF 
treatment group and 8 patients in the PF treatment group; among these, decreased albumin levels 
(lower than 3.5 g/dL) were found in 11 patients in the TPF treatment group and 3 patients in the PF 
treatment group; all these 14 patients (with known decreased albumin levels) exhibited a Grade 3/4 
hypocalcemia (uncorrected for albumin levels).  Upon correction, only 3 of the 14 patients 
demonstrated Grade 3/4 hypocalcemia.  Correction of calcium levels based on corresponding albumin 
levels resulted in fewer cases of Grade 3/4 hypocalcemia in both treatment groups.

Specific Safety Issues 
Neutropenic infection and febrile neutropenia 
Prophylactic antibiotics were used primarily in the TPF treatment group.  A total of 244 patients from 
the TPF treatment group (97.2%) and 68 patients from the PF treatment group (28.0%) received 
primary prophylaxis with antibiotics. 
Secondary infection prophylaxis with G-CSF was required in all subsequent cycles after the first 
episode of febrile neutropenia or documented Grade 3/4 neutropenia with documented infection.  In 
addition, if there was a second episode, the patient was to remain on ciprofloxacin and G-CSF and, 
additionally, during subsequent cycles, the docetaxel dose was to be reduced from 75 mg/m2 to 60 
mg/m2.  The table below presents the number of patients experiencing neutropenic infection and 
febrile neutropenia during induction chemotherapy, regardless of prophylactic G-CSF.   Most patients 
were evaluable for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection.  In correlation with the increased 
incidence of neutropenia Grade 4 in the TPF treatment group (63.3% compared to 28.2% in the PF 
group) there was a higher number of patients with febrile neutropenia (TPF:  12.1%; PF:  6.6%) or 
neutropenic infection (TPF:  11.7%; PF:  8.3%).  All cases of febrile neutropenia and the majority of 
those for neutropenic infection (TPF:  55.2%; PF:  80.0%) were considered to be related to study 
treatment. There were no deaths due to febrile neutropenia.  One patient in the TPF treatment group 
and 1 patient in the PF treatment group died due to neutropenic infection.

Fluid retention 
All patients in the TPF treatment group were to receive corticosteroids to prevent a hypersensitivity 
reaction and also to reduce or delay fluid retention.  There were more patients with fluid retention in 
the TPF treatment group (13.1%) than in the PF treatment group (7.0%). The most frequent associated 
symptom was edema only (12.0% TPF, 5.8% PF).   
Neurologic events 
Baseline neurologic signs and symptoms were present in 67.5% of TPF patients and 69.5% of PF 
patients. During the induction chemotherapy period, neurologic events related to chemotherapy were 
experienced by 32.7% of patients in the TPF treatment group compared to 35.8% of patients in the PF 
treatment group. The events were primarily Grade 1 and 2.  The Grade 3/4 events had a similar 
incidence in the both treatment groups (TPF:  4.8%; PF:  4.5%), and the most frequent were hearing 
disorders.  The majority of events were altered hearing (TPF:  12.7%; PF:  18.5%), sensory 
(TPF:  13.9%; PF:  14.4%), or motor (TPF:  8.8%; PF:  10.3%).

Risk Management Plan 
Due to the ample experience with docetaxel as such, the safety profiles observed in the clinical trials 
TAX323 and TAX324 and the information provided in the SPC, ongoing pharmacovigilance practice 
and procedures are considered adequate to continuously monitor the safety profile of docetaxel.  
Therefore, no Risk Management Plan was considered necessary as part of the current application and 
no additional risk minimisation measures beyond the Product Information are required. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Taxotere  (docetaxel)  has  been  licensed  in  Europe  as  well  as  in  many  other  countries  worldwide  for 
treatment  of  different  malignancies,  mostly  in  combination  therapy.  Its  safety  profile  is  well  known 
and is described in the SPC. Study TAX 324 has not shown a different safety profile of docetaxel as 
compared to study TAX 323 and previous studies.  
The Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) that were more commonly reported with TPF 
compared with PF can mostly be attributed to the addition of docetaxel: neutropenia, neutropenic 
infection, lethargy, diarrhoea, fluid retention, neurosensory, sense of smell/taste altered. However, 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss were observed more frequently with PF 
which may reflect the higher dose intensity of cisplatin.  
No new type of TEAE was identified in the studies. The tolerance of radiotherapy was not impaired by 
the new combination.  
Fewer patients withdraw from the trial  due to adverse events in the TPF treatment group (6.2 % vs. 
11.6 %). It is encouraging that the experimental treatment was associated with fewer deaths within 30 
days of study treatment and that as well fewer deaths due to infections were observed with the three-
drug  combination  compared  to  the  two-drug  combination.  The  routine  antibiotic  prophylaxis  in  the 
TPF group may account to this difference.

The  adverse  drug  reactions  -  as  observed  in  study  TAX  324  -  have  been  displayed  in  a  table  in  the 
SPC. A similar table has previously been included in the SPC for study TAX 323. This approach is 
considered  acceptable  and  the  information  adequate  about  adverse  drug  reactions  during  use  of 
docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for treatment of SCCHN. No additional risk 
minimisation measures beyond the Product Information are required. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a poor 
prognosis. Treatment of advanced SCCHN is complex and involves not only chemotherapy but also 
radiotherapy and surgery. The role of induction chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced 
SCCHN shows evidence that integrating chemotherapy into the treatment plan of locally advanced 
disease might lead to improved survival of patients with unresectable disease.  
Taxotere in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil was approved in 2006 for the induction 
treatment of patients with inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
based on the TAX 323 study. TAX 323 assessed the benefit of induction chemotherapy (TPF vs. PF) 
followed by conventional radiotherapy. 
The results of the phase III study TAX 324, comparing induction treatment with Docetaxel plus 
Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil (TPF) to treatment with Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil (PF), both arms 
were followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) have now been provided as part of the present variation 
application. Based on these data, the MAH has applied to broaden the head and neck cancer indication 
in section 4.1 of the SPC. The proposed wording is: 
“TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the 
induction treatment of patients with inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck.” 
Study TAX 324 investigated induction chemotherapy (TPF vs. PF) followed by concomitant radio-
chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC 1.5 weekly and  2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a 
total dose of 70-72 Gy). 
Patients were randomised to receive either: 
-Test group taxotere (75 mg/m2 D1) associated with cisplatin (100 mg/m2 D1) and 5-FU (1000 
mg/m2/D1-4) (TPF, Q 3 weeks x 3 cycles) 
- Control group: cisplatin (100 mg/m2 D1) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m 2/ D1-5) (PF, Q 3 weeks x 3 
cycles). 
Randomization was stratified upon 3 factors: the primary tumour site (oral cavity vs. oropharynx vs. 
hypopharynx vs. larynx), the N stage (N0-N1 vs. N2-N3) and the centre. 
The population of patients included those who are technically unresectable, those with low probability 
of surgical cure (<20% chance of cure), and those who could be resected but wanted to maintain 
function (organ preservation). Each group comprised of approximately one third of the patient 
population overall. The study population was well balanced based on demographic and clinical 
criteria: the majority of patients were men (83.6%) with good performance status (WHO PS 0 or 1), 
and the median age was 56 years (33 to 82). The most frequent tumour site was oropharynx (52.5%) 
and the most frequent TNM stage, in both groups, was T4/N2.  
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of Overall Survival (OS) adjusted for prognostic 
factors in the ITT population at the end of the study using a Cox proportional hazards model. 
Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (TPF regimen) was associated with a 30% of risk reduction in 
mortality (HR =0.70; 95% CI 0.54-0.9; p=0.0058). 
The secondary analysis supported the conclusions of the primary analysis: 
- Progression Free survival (PFS) was higher in the TPF arm; there was a 29% progression risk 
reduction (HR=0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; p=0.004). 
- Best overall response rate to study treatment (induction chemotherapy and 
chemoradiotherapy) was 76.5% in the TPF group and 71.5% in the PF group. 
- Duration of response: not reached in TPF arm, 41.9 months in the PF arm.

- Time to treatment failure was in favour of the TPF treatment group (20.5 months vs. 10.8 months). 
No difference between groups was observed in the Quality of Life and Clinical benefit assessment. 
Overall, the efficacy results of study TAX 324 are convincing in terms of clinically relevant and 
statistically significant decreased risk of death (OS) and of progression (PFS). 
All provided post hoc analyses within the response document, further confirm the superiority of TPF 
vs. PF in various settings across the included population. The overall treatment plan with radio-
chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy and surgery if considered medically appropriate reflects 
current clinical practice. Study TAX 324 confirms the benefit of induction treatment with TPF in 
patients with inoperable locally advanced head and neck cancer. Exploratory subgroup analyses with 
patients aiming at organ preservation also resulted in a survival benefit with the docetaxel containing 
triple drug induction as compared to the two drug regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil).  
The induction chemotherapy comparator regimen is well recognised. At the time of the initiation of 
Study TAX 324, reference chemotherapy treatment in this neoadjuvant setting of SCCHN was 
cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2. However, it is worth noting that the CRT 
regimen used in study TAX 324 must be considered as suboptimal. More intensive chemotherapy is 
usually used for a CRT based regimen (cisplatin 100mg/m2). However, section 5.1 of the SPC 
adequately describes the design, treatment and outcome of study TAX 324, including a description of 
the CRT regimen used in the pivotal trial. 
In the context of locally advanced head and neck cancer, it is important to highlight the difference 
between inoperable patients (in whom surgery is technically impossible or not indicated) and patients 
in whom surgical resection is not accepted. In the first setting, organ preservation is not an option and 
surgery is simply not feasible. In the second one, surgery is theoretically possible and could be the 
most efficient solution if the aim is prolongation of OS (there are no data contradicting this 
hypothesis).  
However, the fact that organ preservation was not addressed in the TAX 324 study, is mentioned 
specifically in section 5.1 of the SPC in order to prevent the promotion of abstention from surgery in 
patients who are in principle operable. It is furthermore possible, that a trial comparing a 
chemotherapeutic regimen with a surgical approach may not be feasible due to patient’s preference. In 
this context, it is important to note that the results of the TAX 324 trial confirm that in both the overall 
patient population as well as in patients aiming at organ preservation and who are not operated, TPF is 
superior to PF.  
Therefore, with reference to the wording of section 4.1 of the SPC, both the inclusion criteria of the 
TAX  324  study  and  the  favourable  results  for  the  TPF  group  justify  the  deletion  of  the  word 
“inoperable”  from  the  current  indication  in  head  and  neck  cancer.  The  revised  indication  reads: 
“Taxotere in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of 
patients with inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.” 
Further  changes  refer  to  SPC  sections  4.2  posology  and  method  of  administration,  4.8  undesirable 
effects, 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the SPC and to update 
the annexes in line with the latest QRD template, which is acceptable. 
Currently, the value of induction chemotherapy in SCCHN remains controversial. TAX 324, by 
design, solely addressed the question of the efficacy and safety of one induction chemotherapy 
regimen compared to another and succeeded in demonstrating a favourable outcome within a 
heterogenous population of patients, both operable and inoperable. Overall, however, the value of the 
triple induction regimen within the multimodal treatment of head and neck cancer (specifically with 
respect to functional conservation) remains to be determined in other therapy optimising clinical trials.

From the safety viewpoint, cutaneous toxicities are reported more frequently in the TPF arm compared 
to the PF arm. However, despite serious toxicities, discontinuation or toxic deaths were rarely 
reported. 
TAX 324 presented toxicities generally tolerable and manageable. Study TAX 324 did not show a 
different safety profile of docetaxel as compared to study TAX 323 and previous studies. All in all, the 
safety profile is in accordance with the expected safety profile of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
-  On 18 October 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on 
the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling 
and Package Leaflet.

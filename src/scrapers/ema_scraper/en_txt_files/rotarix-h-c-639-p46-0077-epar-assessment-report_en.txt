I. RECOMMENDATION 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  from  study  10PN-PD-DIT-028  (Synflorix,  COMPAS  study)  the 
Rapporteur considers that the benefit-risk balance for Rotarix remains unchanged. Please refer to the 
ongoing Synflorix variation application EMEA/H/C/973/II-52 for detailed information. 
II. BACKGROUND 
GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals  submitted  the  application  for  its  live  attenuated  human  rotavirus 
vaccine (HRV) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure on 21 December 
2004. Rotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of 
gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus infection. 
The study reports of 10PN-PD-DIT- 028, i.e. Interim Report Main, Report Main and Annex Report Main, 
are being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 
190112006. 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-028 (=COMPAS study) was a phase III, randomized, controlled multicentre study 
conducted  in  healthy  children  in  Argentina  (42  centres),  Panama  (16  centres)  and  Colombia  (3 
centres) to evaluate Synflorix’ efficacy against community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis 
media (AOM).  
Synflorix  (10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine)  is  a  10-valent  pneumococcal  polysaccharide  conjugate  vaccine 
composed  of  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  polysaccharide  serotypes  1,4,  5,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  23F 
conjugated  to  protein  D,  serotype  18C  conjugated  to  tetanus  toxoid  and  serotype  19F  conjugated  to 
diphtheria toxoid. 
Rotarix  was  not  specifically  studied  in  this  study.  In  Colombia,  2  doses  of  licensed  Rotarix 
vaccine were offered to all subjects within the first six months of life to provide additional benefit. 
According  to  Rotarix  Product  Information,  Rotarix  can  be  administered  at  the  same  time  as  other 
normally recommended vaccines, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type 
b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup 
C conjugate vaccines. 
III. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
No  immunogenicity  results  were  generated  for  Rotarix  in  the  COMPAS  study.  Since  Rotarix  was  co-
administered  with  other  vaccines  in  the  study,  the  safety  analysis  performed  in  the  study  does  not 
relate  to  the  administration  of  Rotarix  alone.  The  overall  safety  conclusion  from  the  study  was  that 
Synflorix was generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3+ I dose schedule in subjects 
aged between 6 and 16 weeks at the time of the first vaccination. 
Assessor’s note: for the study design as well as the aim of the different study reports, please refer to 
the ongoing Synflorix variation application EMEA/H/C/973/II-52 for detailed information. 
IV. MAH’S OVERALL CONCLUSION 
GlaxoSmithKline  has  reviewed  the  results  of  this  study  and  has  concluded  that  no  changes  to  the 
Product Information are needed since no data specifically on Rotarix were obtained in this study. 
V. RAPPORTEUR’S CONCLUSION 
The MAH’s overall conclusion is endorsed.

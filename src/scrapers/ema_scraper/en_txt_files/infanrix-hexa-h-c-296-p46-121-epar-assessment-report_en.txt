1.  Introduction 
On 27 June 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report of a candidate 10-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine safety study in which Infanrix hexa was coadministered, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure SPNG-003 
(113994) study – Article 46 
This study was a phase II, randomized, controlled, multicentre, observer-blind study to assess the 
safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two formulations of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ 
Streptococcus pneumoniae protein containing vaccine given as a 3-dose primary vaccination course co-
administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine during the first 6 months of life and as a booster dose at 
12-15 months of age. Following identification of new subjects receiving concomitant vaccine(s) outside 
the protocol-defined intervals, there were changes in the according-to-protocol cohort for 
immunogenicity; therefore the decision has been made to re-analyse all available data from the 
primary epoch and to present the results in this Study Report, along with reactogenicity/safety and 
immunogenicity data of the booster epoch and immunogenicity results of the co-administered DTPa-
HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine for both epochs. Note that for the confirmatory objectives, the results of first 
analysis (included in the SPNG-003 (113994) Report (Epoch 001) Amendment 1 dated 09 January 
2014) are considered final and are presented below. 
Methods  
Study Design 
First primary objective was to support that GSK Biologicals’ candidate pneumococcal protein-
containing vaccine (dPly 10 μg and PhtD 10 μg), when administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination 
course, is non-inferior to 10Pn-PD-DiT (Synflorix), when coadministered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib

vaccine (Infanrix hexa) in infants, in terms of post-primary immunization febrile reactions 
with fever > 40.0° C (rectal temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination.  
The second primary objective (sequential)1 was to support that GSK Biologicals’ candidate 
pneumococcal protein-containing vaccine (dPly 30 μg and PhtD 30 μg), when administered as a 3-dose 
primary vaccination course, is non-inferior to 10Pn-PD-DiT (Synflorix), when coadministered with 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) in infants, in terms of post-primary 
immunization febrile reactions with fever > 40.0° C (rectal temperature) with causal 
relationship to vaccination.    
Criteria for safety: 
Each non-inferiority was supported if one could rule out an increase, in terms of percentage of subjects 
with fever > 40.0°C (rectal measurement) with causal relationship to vaccination (10Pn+Proteins 
group as compared to 10Pn group) above 5% + half the incidence in the control group (= null 
hypothesis) as shown by a one-sided P-value < 5%.  
Fig. 1 Study Design 
Table 1 illustrates the power to rule out an increase according to various incidences in the control 
group. Study Population was a healthy male or female, between and including 6 and 14 weeks (42-104 
days) of age at the time of the first vaccination, born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks 
inclusive. 
Table 1. Power to rule out the null hypothesis that the increase in the percentage of subjects with 
fever greater than 40.0 degree Celsius (rectal temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination 
(10Pn+Proteins group as compared to the 10Pn group) is above a pre-defined boundary (delta) 
(N=150 in each group)  
1 The second primary objective was assessed sequentially: it was not possible to conclude on the second primary objective 
if the first primary objective could not be demonstrated.

Safety and reactogenicity 
The primary safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort (TVC). 
1.  Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
•  Standardized asymptotic 95% CIs for the difference between groups (10Pn+Proteins 
groups minus 10Pn group) in terms of percentage of subjects reporting fever > 40.0°C 
(rectal temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination after the primary vaccination 
schedule. 
• 
The one-sided p-value for the null hypothesis, i.e. that the increase in the percentage of 
subjects with fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination 
(10Pn+Proteins groups as compared to 10Pn group) would be above 5% + half the 
incidence in the control group, was also computed. The first primary objective would be 
reached if the p-value is below 5%, when considering 10vPP10 group. The sequential 
second primary objective would be reached if the first primary objective is reached and if 
the p-value, when considering 10vPP30 group, is below 5%. 
Assessor’s comment 
Based on previous experiences with 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine, incidence of fever >40.0°C (rectal 
temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination varied from 0.0% to 1.4% (reported in 10PN-PD-
DIT-003 (105554) study).

In the Infanrix hexa SmPC last update (22 december 2015), the following wordings are presented :  
Section 4.4 
The physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with 
a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13), or with a measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) 
vaccine, compared to that occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were 
mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39°C) and transient (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Section 4.8 
In clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar (PCV7) as a 
booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 43.4% of infants receiving Prevenar and 
Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the hexavalent vaccine alone. Fever ≥
39.5°C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix hexa with or without Prevenar, respectively 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The incidence and severity of fever following co-administration of the two vaccines in 
the primary series was lower than that observed after the booster dose. 
Meanwhile, in the SPNG003 study protocol the MAH addresses the causal relationship by the following : 
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines, it may not be possible to determine the causal 
relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccines administered. The investigator should, therefore, assess 
whether the AE could be causally related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines. 
…. 
Causality of all other AEs was to be assessed by the investigator using the following question: Was there a 
reasonable possibility that the AE might have been caused by the investigational product? 
NO: The AE was not causally related to administration of the study vaccine(s). There were other, more likely causes 
and administration of the study vaccine(s) was not suspected to have contributed to the AE. 
YES: There was a reasonable possibility that the vaccine(s) contributed to the AE. 
Concerning the previous paragraph on Safety/Reactogenicity, it is not clear how the causal 
relationship of fever >40°C to vaccination after the primo-vaccination was assessed. The 
MAH is requested to discuss this methodology concern. The Applicant should present and 
discuss the number of patients considered to develop fever causally related to vaccination 
versus the number of patients the fever non-causally related to vaccination. The causal 
factors for fever other than vaccination should be discussed for the latter patients. 
2.  Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
• 
The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE 
during the 7- day (Days 0-6) solicited follow-up period was tabulated for each group, 
after each vaccine dose and overall primary doses, with exact 95% CI. The percentage 
of doses followed by each individual solicited local and general AE during the 7-day 
(Days 0-6) solicited follow-up period was tabulated for each group, over the full 
primary vaccination course, with exact 95% CI. The same tabulation was performed for 
grade 3 solicited AEs and for solicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination. For 
redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also tabulated. Occurrence of fever was

reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments. All the above tabulations for each individual 
solicited AE were also performed for the first 4 days after each vaccination (Days 0-3). 
• 
The proportion of subjects/doses with at least one report of unsolicited AE classified by 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reported up to 30 days 
after primary or booster vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group. 
The same tabulation was performed for grade 3 unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs 
with a relationship to vaccination. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary 
analysis) and on the TVC. 
1.  Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis 
95% CIs for the antibody GMC ratios (10vPP30 group over 10vPP10 group and 10vPP10 group 
over 10vPP30 group), one month after the third dose of the primary immunization course, 
were computed for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations. First secondary objective 
would be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio between the 10vPP30 group 
and the 10vPP10 group was below 1.0 for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations OR if 
the UL of the 95% CI for GMC ratio between the 10vPP10 group and the 10vPP30 group was 
below 1.0 for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations. 
2.  Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
At each timepoint that a blood sample result was available and for each group: 
•  Geometric mean concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated for 
each serotype*/antigen 
•  Seropositivity/seroprotection rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for each 
appropriate serotype*/antigen 
•  Vaccine response rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for HBs antigen2. 
•  Vaccine response/booster vaccine response rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated 
for each pertussis antigen. 
• 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each appropriate 
serotype3/antigen was displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution 
curves (RCCs). 
Results 
Safety results: 
1.  Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
•  No fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature) considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
primary vaccination was reported in any of the 4 study groups. 
2 Note: investigations on the quality of some serology assays revealed that the anti-HBs ELISA overestimated 
concentrations between 10-100 mIU/mL while values > 100 mIU/mL were confirmed valid. Therefore, all available samples 
at the one month post-dose 3 timepoint for which the anti- HBs antibody concentration was between 10-100 mIU/mL by in-
house ELISA were retested by the commercial assay Centaur™, an FDA-approved and CE-marked CLIA with a cut-off 
defining seropositivity of 6.2 mIU/mL. Anti-HBs seroprotection was redefined as in-house ELISA concentration > 100 
mIU/mL or CLIA concentration > 10 mIU/mL. 
3 Note that opsonophagocytic activity against the vaccine-related serotype 19A will be measured with a 
multiplex OPA and results will be presented in an Annex Report when available.

• 
• 
The first primary confirmatory objective to demonstrate that the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 
vaccine is non-inferior to the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in terms of post-primary immunisation 
febrile reactions with fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature) considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to vaccination was reached as the 1-sided p-value was below 5% (p-value = 
0.003).  
The second primary confirmatory objective (sequential) was the same criterion as the first one 
but considering the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccine compared to the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
It was reached as the first primary objective was reached and the one sided p-value for the 
second primary objective was below 5% (p-value = 0.003). 
2.  Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
Primary epoch 
During the 7-day post-primary vaccination period:  
•  Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom at the pneumococcal 
vaccine injection site (reported after 37.2%, 38.1%, 33.6% and 34.5% of doses in the 
10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively). No more than 2.7% of doses were 
followed by grade 3 solicited local symptoms of given category, in each group.  
• 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (reported after 
55.5%, 55.5%, 55.0% and 56.6% of doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 
groups, respectively). General symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination were reported after a maximum of 43.6%, 43.1%, 41.8% and 41.5% of doses 
(irritability) in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively. No more than 
4.8% of doses (irritability) were followed by grade 3 general solicited symptoms in each group 
and most of them were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.  
•  No increase in the incidence of solicited local and general symptoms was observed with 
consecutive doses of either 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 or 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccines, 
during the 3-dose primary vaccination course.   
During the 31-day post-primary vaccination period:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/57172/2017

•  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported after 16.9%, 21.4%, 20.1% and 20.0% of 
doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 group, respectively.  
•  Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported after 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.2% of doses in the 
10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 group, respectively. Of these, one grade 3 symptom (hypotonic-
hyporesponsive episode in one subject in the 10Pn group) was considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination.  
•  Unsolicited symptoms considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were 
reported after 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.2% of doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and 
Prev13 groups, respectively. 
Booster epoch 
During the 7-day post-booster vaccination period: 
• 
The most frequently reported solicited local symptoms at the pneumococcal vaccine injection 
site were redness in the 10vPP10 and 10Pn groups (reported for 47.9% and 41.0% of 
subjects, respectively) and pain in the 10vPP30 and Prev13 groups (reported for 45.7% and 
44.3% of subjects). No more than 5.7% of subjects were reported with grade 3 solicited local 
symptoms of given category, in each group. Rates of pain for both 10vPP10 and 10vPP30 
investigational groups seem to be higher after booster dose than after primary doses of the 
same vaccines; however similar observation can be made for the control 10Pn and Prev13 
groups.  
• 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (reported for 66.0%, 
60.0%, 59.0% and 64.3% of subjects in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, 
respectively). General symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination were reported for a maximum of 59.7%, 58.6%, 54.7% and 59.3% of subjects 
(irritability) in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively. No more than 
8.3% of subjects (irritability) were reported with grade 3 general solicited symptoms in each 
group and most of them were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination. For some solicited general AEs (e.g. loss of appetite and fever), a trend for higher 
rate of symptoms reported after booster dose when compared to the last primary dose can be 
observed; however similar observation can be made for the control 10Pn and Prev13 groups. 
During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period: 
•  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 27.8%, 18.6%, 19.3% and 24.3% of 
subjects in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively.  
•  Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported for 1.4% and 2.1% of subjects in the 10vPP10 
and Prev13 groups, respectively. None were considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to vaccination.  
•  Unsolicited symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were 
reported for 1.4% and 0.7% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively.  
No fatal SAEs were reported during the entire study period. At least one non-fatal SAE was reported 
for 56 out of 575 subjects during the primary epoch and for 4 out of 564 subjects during the booster 
epoch.  
One SAE (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in one subject in the 10Pn group on the day of 
vaccination dose 1) was assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All events

recovered/resolved by the time of study end, except for 4 events (2 cases of psychomotor retardation, 
type I diabetes mellitus and thermal burn).  
During the primary epoch, one subject from the 10Pn group was withdrawn from the study due to a 
SAE (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode).  
During the booster epoch, 2 subjects were withdrawn from the study due to an SAE (psychomotor 
retardation in the 10Pn group and type I diabetes mellitus in the 10vPP30 group). 
Immunogenicity results:

Discussion & Conclusion: 
The sequential primary confirmatory objectives of this study were reached:  Vaccine 10Pn-PD-DiT-
dPly- PhtD 10 vaccine and 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccine given as 3-dose primary vaccination co-
administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine did not induce more febrile reactions (fever > 40.0°C 
(rectal temperature)) with causal relationship to vaccination than in the control group receiving 10Pn- 
PD-DiT vaccine co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, in terms of an increase above the 
boundary 5% + half the incidence in the control group. No fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature)

considered by the investigator to be causally related to primary vaccination was reported in any of the 
4 study groups.   
The secondary confirmatory objective was reached: superiority of the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 
vaccine formulation to the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 vaccine formulation in terms of post-dose 3 
immune responses to pneumococcal proteins Ply and PhtD in infants was demonstrated.  The results 
showed that the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 and 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccines induced immune 
responses in infants to all vaccine antigens (i.e. Ply and PhtD pneumococcal proteins, pneumococcal 
serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides and protein D). The immune response to pneumococcal 
serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides and protein D did not seem to be altered by addition of 
pneumococcal proteins dPly and PhtD in the combined protein and conjugate vaccine recipients 
compared to 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine recipients.  Immunogenicity of the co-administered vaccine Infanrix 
hexa appeared unaffected and assessment of the safety and reactogenicity profile did not raise any 
concerns.   
At least one non-fatal SAE was reported for 56 out of 575 subjects (12 in the 10vPP10 group, 9 in the 
10vPP30 group, 21 in the 10Pn group and 14 in the Prev13 group) during the primary epoch and for 4 
out of 564 subjects (one in the 10vPP10 group and 3 in the Prev13 group) during the booster epoch. 
One SAE (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in subject in the 10Pn group on the day of vaccination 
dose 1) was assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.   
In conclusion, in this study SPNG-003 [EudraCT 2010-019730-27] , the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 and 
10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccine formulations were generally well-tolerated and immunogenic and 
was well tolerated with co-administration of Infanrix Hexa.  
Assessor’s comments 
The MAH has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of the study SPNG003. 
The immunogenicity data were in line with the current PI for Infanrix hexa. 
For the incidences of pain, redness and swelling related to the Infanrix hexa injection site after primo 
or booster immunization, they were in line with the currently PI wherein they are listed as “very 
common”. 
For the incidences of general solicited adverse events (i.e irritability, loss of appetite and fever 
(>38°C)) related to the Infanrix hexa injection after primo or booster immunization, they were in line 
with the currently PI wherein they are listed as “very common”. Furthermore, the MAH considered that 
the incidence of “drowsiness” was in line with the incidence “very common” listed in the PI of Synflorix 
and higher than the incidence of “drowsiness”  listed in the PI of Infanrix hexa.  
The MAH should explain to which adverse events it is referring as the term “drowsiness” is 
not listed in the current PI of Infanrix hexa (see below) and to which general solicited 
adverse event(s) the term drowsiness could be related to the listed adverse events listed in 
the current SmPC section 4.8. 
In conclusion, in this study SPNG-003 [EudraCT 2010-019730-27] , the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 and 
10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccine formulations were generally well-tolerated and immunogenic and 
was well tolerated with co-administration of Infanrix Hexa. Immunogenicity of the co-administered 
vaccine Infanrix hexa appeared unaffected and assessment of the safety and reactogenicity profile did

not raise any new safety concerns.  The Company concluded that currently no changes to the Product 
Information of Infanrix hexa were needed as the benefit/risk remained favourable, which is acceptable.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The Rapporteur agrees and endorses the discussion and conclusion of the MAH to the RSI.. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
  PAM not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required: 
RSI: 
1.  it is not clear how the causal relationship of fever >40°C to vaccination after the 
primo-vaccination was assessed. The MAH is requested to discuss this methodology 
concern. The Applicant should present and discuss the number of patients considered 
to develop fever causally related to vaccination versus the number of patients the 
fever non-causally related to vaccination. The causal factors for fever other than 
vaccination should be discussed for the latter patients. 
2.  For the incidences of general solicited adverse events (i.e irritability, loss of appetite and fever 
(>38°C)) related to the Infanrix hexa injection after primo or booster immunization, they were 
in line with the currently PI wherein they are listed as “very common”. Furthermore, the MAH 
considered that the incidence of “drowsiness” was in line with the incidence “very common” 
listed in the PI of Synflorix and higher than the incidence of “drowsiness”  listed in the PI of 
Infanrix hexa.  
The MAH should explain to which adverse events it is referring as the term 
“drowsiness” is not listed in the current PI of Infanrix hexa and to which general 
solicited adverse event(s) the term “drowsiness” could be referred to in the adverse 
events listed in the current SmPC section 4.8.

A causality assessment is usually required for adverse event cases in clinical trials. In study SPNG-003, 
it was the investigator’s responsibility to assess the causality of any adverse event to the 
investigational product, as detailed in the clinical trial protocol. Moreover, the investigator was also

instructed to consult the Investigator Brochure and/or PI for marketed products in the determination of 
the causality assessment.  
Extract of the protocol:  
“The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to determine the relationship. 
Alternative plausible causes, based on natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure and/or 
Product Information for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. 
…  
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines, it may not be possible to determine the 
causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccines administered. The investigator should, 
therefore, assess whether the AE could be causally related to vaccination rather than to the individual 
vaccines.  
…  
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causally related to vaccination. Causality 
of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the investigational 
product?  
NO : The AE is not causally related to administration of the study vaccine(s). There are other, more 
likely causes and administration of the study vaccine(s) is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.  
YES : There is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine(s) contributed to the AE. “  
The number of patients considered to develop fever causally related to vaccination versus the number 
of patients for whom the fever was considered non-causally related to vaccination, following each dose, 
overall/dose and overall/subject reported during the 7- day post-vaccination period are detailed in 
Table 25 of the MAH responses to the RSI ; and the incidence of fever (and other solicited general AEs) 
following each dose, overall/dose and overall/subject reported during the 4-day post-vaccination 
period are detailed in Table 7.25 in the Clinical Study Report. 
As expected, the majority of fever cases (>72% of reported fever cases following each dose and 
overall) was assessed by the investigator as ‘related’ to either vaccine or vaccination. 
According to the protocol, the investigator had to consider underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product; however, 
the investigator was not requested to provide the more likely cause of fever in case the fever was 
assessed as ‘not related’ to study vaccine or vaccination. Therefore the Company cannot comment on 
other plausible causal factors of fever being assessed as not related to the vaccine/vaccination. 
Assessor’s comment 
The methodology is acceptable and the issue is considered resolved.

2.  The MAH should explain to which adverse events it is referring as the term 
“drowsiness” is not listed in the current PI of Infanrix hexa and to which general 
solicited adverse event(s) the term “drowsiness” could be referred to in the adverse 
events listed in the current SmPC section 4.8. 
The Company acknowledges that the term DROWSINESS is not listed in the PI of Infanrix hexa. 
However, the PI of Infanrix hexa lists the MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) SOMNOLENCE with a frequency 
‘uncommon’, as observed in clinical trials with Infanrix hexa.   
It is to be noted that the PT SOMNOLENCE comprises several Lower Level Terms (LLTs) amongst which 
DROWSINESS. In the SPNG-003 study the event DROWSINESS is a solicited general adverse event. 
Any possible term of SOMNOLENCE (e.g. SLEEPY) would therefore be reported under the solicited 
event DROWSINESS.   
In its conclusions, the Company therefore considered that the incidence of DROWSINESS as observed 
in clinical trial SPNG-003 was in line with the incidence ‘very common’ as listed in the PI of Synflorix 
and was higher than the incidence of SOMNOLENCE (which includes SOMNOLENCE and 
DROWNSINESS) as listed in the PI of Infanrix hexa.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. submitted on 26 February 2020 an extension of the marketing 
authorisation. 
The MAH applied for the addition of a new pharmaceutical form (inhalation powder) associated with a 
new strength (88µg / 5µg / 9µg). The RMP (version 6.2) is updated in accordance. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (2) points (c) (d) - Extensions of marketing authorisation. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did seek Scientific advice at the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The purpose of this application is to add new pharmaceutical form (inhalation powder) associated with 
a new strength (88µg / 5µg / 9µg) for the currently approved COPD indication only.

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Trimbow is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) with specific risk factors.  
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  is  an  inflammatory  disease  of  the  airways  characterised  by  a 
progressive  decline  in  lung  function  that  is  accompanied  by  cough,  excess  sputum  production  and 
breathlessness  [Lopez  et  al.,  20061],  [Mathers  and  Loncar,  20062].  Pharmacologic  therapy  for  COPD 
aims to reduce symptoms, exacerbations frequency and severity, and improve exercise tolerance and 
overall health status [Tashkin et al., 20083]. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant 
condition. In COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients 
are  male  and  for  both  males  and  females  the  average  age  tends  to  be  in  the  early  sixties.  In  poor 
countries the male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking 
over open fires. The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower 
affluence and social status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which 
is cheap, easy, and non-invasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of 
the  value  of  screening  for  COPD.  Tobacco  smoking  cessation  or  non/never  smoking  is  an  effective 
measure and societal efforts have been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes. 
COPD  is  a  major  public  health  problem  and  is  the  fourth  leading  cause  of  death  in  the  world,  with 
increasing prevalence and mortality predicted in the coming decades. COPD is projected to be the third 
leading cause of death by 2020 [GOLD 2020]. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The chronic airflow limitation that is characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airway disease 
(e.g.  obstructive  bronchiolitis)  and  parenchymal  destruction  (emphysema).  The  relative  contributions 
vary  from  person  to  person  and  evolve  at  different  rates  over  time.  Chronic  inflammation  causes 
structural changes, narrowing of the small airways and destruction of the lung parenchyma leading to 
the loss of alveolar attachments to the small airways and decreased lung elastic recoil. 
The  main  risk  factor  for  COPD  is  tobacco  smoking.  However,  other  environmental  exposures  such  as 
biomass fuel exposure and air pollution may also contribute. Host factors (e.g. genetic abnormalities, 
abnormal lung function and accelerated aging) predispose individuals to develop COPD. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage 
COPD is characterised by cough, dyspnoea on exertion or even at rest, with a consequent reduction of 
physical  activity  and  deterioration  of  quality  of  life  (QoL)  [GOLD  2020].  The  inflammatory  response 
contributes  to  small  airways  disease  (e.g.  obliterative  bronchiolitis)  and  emphysema,  which  in  turn 
reduce  the  elastic  recoil  of  the  lungs  leading  to  collapse  and  obstruction  of  the  small  airways  during 
exhalation.  Systemic  features  of  COPD  are  very  common  [Barnes  PJ  and  Celli  BR  2009]  and  their

evaluation allows a more accurate prediction of mortality risk and comorbidity risk than lung function 
alone [Cote CG et al., 2007], [De Torres JP et al., 2009], [Puhan MA et al., 2009]. 
During  the  natural  course  of  COPD,  the  majority  of  patients  develop  acute  episodes  of  worsening  of 
symptoms that differ from the day to day variations and may require modifications in therapy (GOLD 
2019). These episodes are referred to as exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are important because they 
are  associated  with  accelerated  FEV1  decline  [Donaldson  GC  et  al.,  2002],  significant  morbidity, 
healthcare cost and mortality [Celli BR and Barnes PJ, 2007]. 
According  to  the  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  document  [GOLD  2020],  the 
assessment  of  the  disease  severity  should  take  into  account  various  aspects  of  the  disease  such  as 
symptoms, degree of airflow limitation, exacerbation risk and comorbidities. Based on the overall disease 
severity, COPD patients can be divided into the following four groups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Group  A  (i.e.  patients  with  low  risk  [of  future  events  such  as  exacerbations,  hospital 
admissions or death] and less symptoms); 
Group B (i.e. patients with low risk and more symptoms); 
Group C (i.e. patients with high risk and less symptoms); 
Group D (i.e. patients with high risk and more symptoms). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently,  the  main  treatment  options  for  patients  with  COPD  belong  to  a  restricted  number  of 
pharmacological  classes  including  bronchodilators  (short-acting  β2-agonists  [SABAs]  and  long-acting 
β2agonists  [LABAs]),  antimuscarinics  (short-acting  muscarinic  antagonists  [SAMAs]  and  long-acting 
muscarinic  antagonists  [LAMAs]),  and  inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS).  Phosphodiesterase-4  (PDE-4) 
inhibitors are a relatively new class of medicines that combine a dual albeit limited bronchodilator and 
anti
inflammatory effect [Vogelmeier et al., 20174].   
‐
The GOLD document recommends the use of one or more long-acting bronchodilators as maintenance 
therapy for the treatment and management of COPD [GOLD, 20205]. A number of studies have shown 
that combining bronchodilators of different pharmacologic classes may improve lung function compared 
with bronchodilators used as monotherapies [Cazzola et al., 2004a6], [Brashier et al., 20057], [Cazzola 
et al., 20058]. Such combinations of bronchodilators with different mechanisms and duration of action 
may increase the degree of bronchodilation leading to better symptom control. ICS are highly effective 
as anti-inflammatory treatments in respiratory diseases and maintenance treatment with ICS is routinely 
used in association with LABAs for patients with a history of exacerbations despite treatment with long-
acting bronchodilators. Such ICS/LABA combinations may be the first choice of initial therapy in some

patients,  such  as  those  with  a  history  and/or  finding  suggestive  of  asthma-COPD  overlap  syndrome 
(ACOS) [GINA, 20199].  
The triple combination therapy of inhaled ICS, LABA and LAMA, has become an option for maintenance 
treatment of COPD and as a “step-up” therapy from double combination therapies. Moreover, since the 
components of triple therapy have different and complementary molecular mechanisms of action, there 
is a logical rationale for the use of these drugs together leading to enhanced clinical benefits [Cazzola et 
al., 2004b10], [van Noord et al., 200511]. Indeed, when patients remain symptomatic with dual therapies, 
the combination of all three classes (ICS, LABA and LAMA) is recommended (as a rational escalation of 
pharmacological management). 
2.2.  About the product 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Trimbow 100/6/12.5 Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI), hereafter also referred to as CHF 5993 DPI, is a triple 
fixed dose combination (FDC) of the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), the 
long-acting  β2-agonist  (LABA)  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  (FF)  and  the  long-acting  muscarinic 
antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium bromide (GB), developed by the MAH. 
CHF 5993 was first developed for COPD and first formulated to be delivered via a pressurised metered 
dose inhaler (pMDI). On 18 May 2017, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting 
of a MA for  Trimbow pMDI, for the maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  (COPD).  The  approved  posology  is  two  inhalations  of  Trimbow  pMDI  100/6/12.5 
micrograms twice daily (i.e. total daily dose: 400 µg BDP, 24 µg FF, 50 µg GB). 
In the present application, the MAH seeks to add a different formulation of Trimbow, namely an inhalation 
powder delivered by means of a multi-dose breath-actuated Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). The same device 
is currently marketed in Europe for the administration of the MAH’s dual FDC CHF 1535 inhalation powder 
(Foster NEXThaler and other tradenames), containing BDP 100 µg/inhalation and FF 6 µg/inhalation.  
Trimbow DPI is intended to be used in the same COPD indication as Trimbow pMDI and at same doses 
(2 inhalations bid): 
 “Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary 
disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-
acting  beta2  agonist  or  a  combination  of  a  long-acting  beta2  agonist  and  a  long-acting  muscarinic 
antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1)”. 
The  device  consists  of  a  casework  comprising  a  lower  shell  (1)  with  window  to  display  dose  counting 
numbers (2) and an integral cover (3), with cover retention clips (3a) to hold the cover (3) in the closed 
position during transit and cover grip ribs (3b) to improve the patient grip to open the cover (3). The 
cover  (3)  also  drives  the  device  internal  inhalation  and  metering  mechanism.  When  the  cover  (3)  is 
rotated open it reveals a mouthpiece (4) through which the patient is able to inhale the final active blend:

The device contains a dose counter that indicates the number of doses remaining and decrements the 
number, by one, each time a dose is taken (6) as shown below: 
A threshold Peak Inspiratory Flow (PIF) is required to trigger the breath actuated mechanism (BAM) of 
the inhaler and if this threshold PIF cannot be achieved by the patient, inhaler use will be unsuccessfully. 
The peak inspiratory flow achieved by the patient is not only dependent on a patient’s inhalation effort 
but also on the internal resistance of the inhaler. 
Trimbow DPI is a multidose pre-loaded device containing 120 doses. 
An  overview  of  the  Chiesi  Trimbow  and  Foster  portfolios  were  provided  along  with  the  authorised  or 
proposed packaging elements and corresponding colours schemes. The use of different colours across 
the packaging elements and the inhalers will likely ensure the correct management and differentiation 
within the Trimbow and the Foster portfolios since the two product “families” significantly differ in terms 
of colour schemes.

The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The clinical development programme of CHF 5993 DPI was conducted according to the following CHMP 
guidelines:  
• 
• 
EMA/CHMP/158268/2017:  Guideline  on  clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  medicinal 
products;  
EMA/CHMP/483572/2012:  Guideline  on  clinical  investigations  of  medicinal  products  in  the 
treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD);  
•  CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1: Requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products 
(OIP)  including  the  requirements  for  demonstration  of  therapeutic  equivalence  between  two 
inhaled products for use in the treatment of Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) in adults and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents. 
The main rationale for the development of CHF 5993 DPI was to make the extra-fine single-inhaler triple 
therapy option (BDP/FF/GB) available for patients who prefer the use of a DPI, or who are unable to use 
a pMDI correctly. 
The  main  objective  of  the  clinical  development  programme  for  CHF  5993  DPI  was  to  demonstrate 
equivalence between CHF 5993 DPI and the already authorised CHF 5993 pMDI for each of the individual 
components (BDP, FF and GB) by a direct comparison between these two products in accordance with 
the  orally  inhaled  product  (OIP)  guideline  (CPMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev.  1,  2009)  and  scientific  advices 
received from CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017). 
EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III: The Company was seeking a SWP/CHMP advice on the quality, non-clinical 
and clinical development plan to support registration for the DPI formulation. 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017:  The  Company  was  seeking  a  follow-up  CHMP/SAWP  advice  on  the 
design of the proposed PD study as well as on the overall clinical plan to support registration for the DPI 
formulation.  
After  an  in  vitro  comparison  between  CHF  5993  DPI  and  CHF  5993  pMDI,  a  step-wise  approach  was 
followed  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of  any  differences  on  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  on  clinical 
efficacy and safety parameters.

2. Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product subject of this line extension, Trimbow 100/6/12.5 (also referred to as CHF 5993 
DPI), is presented as an inhalation powder; since it is delivered through a dry powder inhaler (DPI), the 
finished product is also referred to as Trimbow 100/6/12.5 DPI. The inhalation powder is a fixed dose 
combination  of  beclometasone  dipropionate,  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  and  glycopyrronium 
bromide.  It  is  a  new  dosage  form  of  the  already  authorised  Trimbow  87/5/9  pressurised  inhalation 
solution  (EMEA/H/C/004257)  which  is  delivered  through  a  pressurised  metered-dose  inhaler  (pMDI), 
hence, it is also referred to as Trimbow 87/5/9 pMDI. 
Each  delivered  dose  (the  dose  leaving  the  mouthpiece)  contains  88  micrograms  of  beclometasone 
dipropionate, 5 micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate and 9 micrograms of glycopyrronium (as 
11 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide). 
Each metered dose contains 100 micrograms of beclometasone dipropionate, 6 micrograms of formoterol 
fumarate  dihydrate  and  10  micrograms  of  glycopyrronium  (as  12.5  micrograms  glycopyrronium 
bromide). 
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. 
As described in section 6.5 of the SmPC, the product is available in a white inhaler with a grey mouthpiece 
cover and a counter for the inhalations. It consists of a casework comprising of a lower shell with window 
to display number of inhalations left and an integral cover. When opened, the cover, which also drives 
the dose counter mechanism, reveals a mouthpiece through which the medicinal product is inhaled. The 
lower shell and mouthpiece are made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and the cover is made from 
polypropylene.  The  inhaler  is  packed  into  a  thermo  welded  Polyamide/Aluminium/Polyethylene 
(PA/Al/PE) or Polyethylene-Terephthalate/Aluminium/ Polyethylene (PET/Al/PE) pouch. 
2.2.2.  Active substances 
The  active  substances  beclometasone  dipropionate  (BDP),  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  (FF)  and 
glycopyrronium bromide (GB) used in the manufacture of Trimbow 100/6/12.5 DPI are also used in the 
manufacture of the authorised Trimbow 87/5/9 pMDI (EMEA/H/C/004257), hence, limited data has been 
provided under 3.2.S; this is accepted.  
All the active substances are supported by CEP. The micronisation of each active substance has been 
adequately accounted for.The physical characteristics of the active substances which may have an impact 
on  the  finished  product  aerodynamic  performance  have  been  discussed  in  the  pharmaceutical 
development section below. The active substances’ specifications have been updated to include particle 
size. The specification limits have been justified based on development data, including batches used in 
the bioequivalence study. The particle size distribution is determined by laser diffraction and the method 
has been described and validated for each active substance. Otherwise, the specifications are identical 
to those for the active substances used in the pMDI formulation. 
The actives substance specifications for the three active substances comply with the specifications and 
test methods of the European Pharmacopoeia, as applicable.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product subject of this line extension, Trimbow 100/6/12.5 micrograms (also referred to as 
CHF 5993 DPI), is presented as an inhalation powder.  The qualitative and quantitative composition of 
the finished product is provided.  
An over-fill has been introduced to ensure delivery of the nominal number of inhalations (120) stated on 
the label, throughout the shelf-life of the finished product. No overage is proposed. The inhalation powder 
is a blend of the three active substances with lactose and magnesium stearate.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  used  for  this  route  of  administration, 
pharmaceutical form and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and 
in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Trimbow 100/6/12.5 DPI has been developed to increase the therapeutic options for patients unable to 
use the marketed pMDI correctly, in view of the more complex inhalation technique required for to ensure 
that the dose is inhaled rather than deposited in the oral cavity. With pMDIs, the patient has to coordinate 
breathing actuating the inhaler; when using a DPI, the inhalation also triggers the actuation of the dose. 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) MAH has experience in the development and manufacture of 
DPI products; the main difference between their nationally authorised Foster 100/6 DPI and Trimbow 
100/6/12.5  DPI  is  that  Trimbow  DPI  also  includes  GB.  The  inhalation  device  for  both  products  is  the 
same.  
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  finished  product  contains  QbD  elements.  The  quality  target 
product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  as  a  stable,  free-flowing  formulation  with a  high  and  reproducible 
aerodynamic performance resulting into the desired lung deposition when using the proposed device.  
The  formulation  and  manufacturing  development  have  been  evaluated  through  the  use  of  risk 
assessment and design of experiments (DoE) to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical 
process  parameters.  Risk  analysis  was  performed  using  the  failure  mode  and  effects  analysis  (FMEA) 
and/or  the  fault  tree  analysis  (FTA)  methods  in  order  to  identify  the  risk  criteria  that  may  have  an 
influence  on  the  finished  product  quality  attributes.  The  risk  identification  was  based  on  the  prior 
knowledge  of  products  with  similar  formulations  and  manufacturing  processes  as  well  as  on  the 
experience  from  formulation  development,  process  design  and  scale-up  studies.  The  critical  process 
parameters have been adequately identified.  
The composition of the active substances per metered dose in the DPI is the same as in the pMDI product. 
Early formulation development and process trials showed the effect of formulation and process changes 
on the aerosol performance is similar for the three active substances. Once the composition of the DPI 
formulation was identified to achieve the desired in vitro pharmaceutical performance (i.e. aerodynamic 
particle size distribution), several studies, including a full factorial DoE study, were carried out to assess 
the potential effect of the three active substances’ particle size distributions (PSD of FF, GB and BDP) on 
product  performance.  For  all  the  active  substances,  the  mean  DD  and  FPM  results  are  all  within  the 
development and proposed specifications, confirming the robustness of the formulation. 
Therapeutic equivalence of the DPI product with the pMDI product cannot be demonstrated using in vitro 
results alone as the pharmaceutical form and the delivery devices differ. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  study  was  conducted  examining  two  prototype  DPI  products  with  the  same  quantitative  and 
qualitative formulation but with different aerodynamic performance due to differences in PSD. Neither 
DPI  product  showed  bioequivalence  to  the  pMDI  product.  The  DPI  product  that  showed  a  closer 
performance  to  the  pMDI  product  was  evaluated  in  a  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  study  and  was

demonstrated to meet the criteria of bioequivalence as discussed in the clinical section. This approach is 
in  line  with  the  “Guideline  on  the  requirements  for  clinical  documentation  for  orally  inhaled  products 
(OIP) including the requirements for demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled 
products for use in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults 
and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents” CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1 and had 
previously been endorsed in a Scientific Advice procedure. The FPM limits were set in line with the DPI 
product investigated during the PK and PD studies. The formulation used during clinical studies is the 
same as that intended for marketing. 
The process development was performed focusing on the development of the micronisation process of 
GB  and  the  development  of  the  blending  and  filling  manufacturing  process.  Whilst  the  blending 
investigation  discusses  a  design  space,  no  design  space  is  claimed  for  blending  or  other  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process. During the procedure, the MAH confirmed that only normal operating ranges are 
applicable for the manufacturing method. The studies confirmed the blending time ranges proposed for 
routine manufacture and the capability of the filling process. A process validation study, using different 
raw  material  batches,  demonstrated  good  reproducibility  and  robustness  within  the  variations 
investigated. 
The primary packaging is a white inhaler with a grey mouthpiece cover and a counter for the inhalations, 
also referred to as NEXThaler and as NEXT DPI. The development of the device was performed for Foster. 
The NEXThaler has been modified with minor adaptations for Trimbow 100/6/12.5 DPI (e.g. change in 
component  colour).  The  NEXThaler,  depicted  in  Figure  1  below,  is  a  reservoir  medium  resistance  (45 
L/min)  device,  hence  suitable  for  a  broad  patient  population,  including  children  and  the  elderly.    It 
consists of casework comprising a lower shell (1) with window to display dose counting numbers (2) and 
an integral cover (3), with cover retention clips (3a) to hold the cover (3) in the closed position during 
transit and cover grip ribs (3b) to improve the patient grip to open the cover (3). The cover (3) also 
drives  the  device  internal  inhalation  and  metering  mechanism.  When  the  cover  (3)  is  rotated  open  it 
reveals a mouthpiece (4) through which the patient is able to inhale the final active blend.  
Figure 1: The NEXThaler 
The lower shell and mouthpiece are made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and the cover is made 
from  polypropylene.  The  inhaler  is  packed  into  a  thermo  welded  Polyamide/Aluminium/Polyethylene 
(PA/Al/PE)  or  Polyethylene-Terephthalate/Aluminium/  Polyethylene  (PET/Al/PE)  pouch,  a  functional 
secondary  packaging  material.  The  materials  of  the  primary  packaging  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.

The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  by  meeting  the 
requirements outlined in the “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005).  The  studies  performed  are  summarised  in  Table  1  below  are

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  is  typical  of  those  used  to  manufacture  inhalation  powders,  which  are 
considered specialised pharmaceutical forms and their manufacture is considered to be a non-standard 
process.  
The manufacturing process as well as in-process controls performed have been sufficiently described. 
In-process controls have been identified and are considered adequate. 
The holding times for the intermediate and  final blend are supported by stability data and are acceptable.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form, namely: 
appearance/description  of  the  inhaler  and  dry  powder  (visual),  number  of  inhalations  (Ph.  Eur.), 
identification  of  the  active  substances  (UPLC  and  UPLC/UV),  assay  of  each  active  substance  (UPLC), 
degradation products of each active substance (UPLC), FPM of each active substance (NGI/HPLC), mean 
DD and uniformity of DD for each active substance (Ph. Eur.-DUSA HPLC) and microbial count (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed finished product specification contains the required tests for this dosage form and it is in 
line with the Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021

The limits for impurities and degradation products at release and over the shelf life are in agreement 
with ICH Q3B. Adequate information on genotoxic impurities that could reasonably form in the finished 
product has been provided during the procedure.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk evaluation was conducted concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished 
product has been provided in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020). It was confirmed that no 
risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product 
was identified. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from four production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  in-use  stability  studies  were  conducted 
over  a  period  of  3  months,  on  the  same  batches  used  for  the  long  study,  to  assess  the  product 
performance,  after  being dispensed to  the  patients outside the thermo-welded  pouch  and  kept  under 
long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH).  The  batches  of  the  finished  product  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to the shelf-life specifications The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. No significant changes were observed in the long term and accelerated studies and all results 
were  within  the  proposed  specification  limits.  In  the  in-use  study,  several  out-of-specification  results 
were found from the 8-week data point onward. Therefore, the in-use shelf life of 6 weeks is considered 
justified. Since development studies at extreme humidity conditions indicate that high humidity can have 
an impact on the performance of the product, the un-pouched inhaler should be stored in a dry place. 
No  photostability  stability studies  were  performed  due  to  the  nature  of  the  container  closure  system. 
Since the DPI excludes light, this is accepted.  
The  following  shelf  life  and  storage  precaution  was  proposed  and  can  be  granted  based  on  the  data 
available:  a  shelf-life  of  21  months  below  25  °C  for  the  pouched  inhalers  including  a  maximum  of  6 
weeks  below  25  °C  when  stored  in  a  dry  place  for  the  un-pouched  inhalers,  as  stated  in  the  SmPC 
(section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
With the current line extension, an additional dosage form (i.e. inhalation powder) is proposed. The 
information provided for Trimbow 100/6/12.5 DPI is generally of good quality. All three active 
substances have been approved in the initial application for Trimbow 100/6/12.5 pMDI and are 
micronised for the current DPI formulation to ensure bioequivalence. Information on the development, 
manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The 
results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
CHF  5993  DPI  is  a  triple  fixed  dose  combination  of  the  inhaled  corticosteroid  (ICS)  beclometasone 
dipropionate  (BDP),  the  long-acting  ß2-agonist  (LABA)  formoterol  fumarate  (FF)  and  the  long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium bromide (GB).  
The non-clinical development of CHF 5993 DPI was based on the following assumptions: 
1)  BDP and FF are well known representatives of the ICS and LABA classes and have been used in 
established therapies for many years, both as single components and in a fixed dose combination 
(FDC); 
2)  The non-clinical package of the FDC of BDP and FF has been evaluated positively in the approval 
of the Chiesi product, Foster and associated brand names (as both pMDI and DPI); 
3)  GB  is  a  well-known  representative  of  the  LAMA  class  which  is  approved  for  use  via  oral 
administration as well as intravenous or intramuscular injection in several countries at a dose 
resulting in higher systemic exposure than for an inhaled dosage form. 
Additionally, GB was approved as an inhalation maintenance bronchodilator treatment for COPD 
in the EU (Seebri Breezhaler) and Japan in September 2012 and is now approved in more than 
50 countries. 
4)  The non-clinical package of CHF 5993 pMDI has been evaluated in the approval of Trimbow pMDI.

In  accordance,  for the non-clinical  data on  Pharmacology,  Pharmacokinetics  and  Toxicology,  the  MAH 
referred to the studies submitted for the Trimbow pMDI MAA dossier. A summary of the results of these 
studies was provided as part of this application. 
To provide assurance for the safety of the new CHF 5993 DPI dosage form following the change from a 
pMDI-delivered  solution  to  a  DPI-delivered  powder,  the  MAH  has  performed  additional  repeat  dose 
inhalation bridging toxicity studies (including an evaluation of toxicokinetics and of local tolerance in the 
respiratory system) of 4- and 13-week duration in rats and dogs for the CHF 5993 DPI dosage form. 
A summary of the results of these new studies was provided as part of this application. 
The  CHF  5993  DPI  formulation  contains  lactose  monohydrate  and  magnesium  stearate,  ingredients 
commonly  and  safely  used  in  other  pharmaceutical  products  for  inhalation.  For  this  reason  and  since 
toxicological  data  on  these  excipients  are  available,  separate  preclinical  studies  on  these  compounds 
were not conducted, nor are required. However, in the repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies the animals 
of the control groups were exposed to the vehicle only (lactose and magnesium stearate powder blend). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Concerning  Primary  Pharmacodynamics,  Secondary  Pharmacodynamics,  Safety  Pharmacology,  and 
Pharmacological Drug Interactions the MAH has not presented new studies for CHF 5993 DPI but refers 
to the respective data that were submitted for the Trimbow pMDI MAA dossier. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Concerning Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions the 
MAH refers to the respective data that were submitted for the Trimbow pMDI MAA dossier. 
In addition, specific toxicokinetic data have been obtained for the inhalation powder dosage form in the 
context of the new repeat dose bridging toxicity studies that were conducted for CHF 5993 DPI in rats 
and dogs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Concerning  Single  Dose  Toxicity,  Genotoxicity,  Carcinogenicity,  Reproductive  and  Developmental 
Toxicity  and  Other  Toxicity  Studies  the  MAH  refers  to  the  respective  data  that  were  submitted  for 
Trimbow pMDI MAA dossier. 
2.3.4.1.  Repeat dose toxicity studies  
In this application, the MAH provided new data in rats and dogs in 4 and 13-week repeat dose inhalation 
toxicities studies to investigate systemic effects and the local tolerability on the respiratory system of 
CHF 5993 DPI. No longer studies were carried out since no unexpected findings and no exacerbation of 
toxicity  were  found.  Overall,  the  main  effects  seen  were  attributable  to  the  known  pharmacological 
effects of corticosteroids, β2-agonists and M3 antagonists.  
On the basis of the included toxicokinetic evaluations, safety margins with respect to the clinical dosage 
have been calculated by the MAH on the basis of the human and animal exposure (Cmax and AUC) and 
considering 400+24+50 μg/day of BDP+FF+GB as maximum daily clinical inhalation dose.

Rat studies 
4-week CHF 5993 DPI free combination inhalation toxicity in rats with 4 weeks recovery 
In  a  4-week  inhalation  study,  male  and  female  Wistar  rats  were  exposed  by  nose-only  inhalation,  1 
hour/day for 28 consecutive days to CHF 5993 DPI generated from the combination of Foster DPI (100+6 
μg BDP+FF in 10 mg blend) and GB DPI (25 μg in 10 mg blend) and delivered at achieved inhaled doses 
of  115+5.5+32,  258+14+87  and 1053+50+321  μg/kg/day  BDP+FF+GB.  Two  additional  groups  were 
treated with the single components at the corresponding high doses of Foster (BDF+FF) DPI 1045+52 
μg/kg/day  and  GB  DPI  268  μg/kg/day.  The  rats  of  the  control  group  were  exposed  to  lactose  and 
magnesium stearate powder blend only at exposure conditions similar to the ones used to generate the 
high dose combination. A period of 4 weeks of recovery followed the end of dosing. The Mass Median 
Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) of the active compounds ranged between 1.44 and 3.27 μm, showing 
adequate respirability for the rat. 
Overall, the results were in line with those obtained in the 13-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats 
described below. 
13-week CHF 5993 DPI fixed combination inhalation toxicity in rats with 6 weeks recovery 
In a 13-week inhalation study, male and female rats were exposed by nose-only inhalation, 1 hour/day 
over 13 weeks to CHF 5993 DPI (100+6+12.5 μg BDP+FF+GB in 10 mg blend) at achieved doses of 
105+5.9+12,  325+18+36  and  920+51+100  μg/kg/day  respectively  of  BDP+FF+GB.  Two  additional 
groups were treated with the single components at the following doses: Foster (BDF+FF) DPI 965+54 
μg/kg/day and GB DPI 113 μg/kg/day. The animals of the control group were exposed to lactose and 
magnesium stearate powder blend only, at conditions similar to the high dose combination.  
The aerosols generated were well within the respirable range of the rat with MMADs ranging between 
1.8 and 3.3 μm for all the active ingredients.  
Main study findings: 
These doses were well tolerated but BDP-associated effects (increased body weight gain, slight red blood 
cells, haematocrit and haemoglobin increase and white blood cells (lymphocytes) or platelets decreased, 
metabolism-affected plasma levels with slight changes in urea, creatinine, potassium and triglycerides, 
increased  urinary  volume,  minimal  to  moderate  atrophy  of  the  thymus  and  minimal  to  slight  adrenal 
cortex hypertrophy) were observed respectively at high dose or according to a dose-relationship at all 
dose levels. 
Toxicokinetics 
All animals in the treated groups were exposed systemically to BDP, formoterol and/or glycopyrronium 
and their metabolites.  
- 
- 
- 
Systemic  exposures  of  all  analytes  increased  with  increasing  doses  although  a  clear 
proportionality was not observed for any analyte.  
Exposure to B17MP was higher than that of its parent BDP, while cyclopentylmandelic acid (CMA) 
exposure was lower than that of its parent compound glycopyrronium. 
No notable accumulation of any of the compounds was observed. 
Conclusions 
BDP-associated effects [e.g. increased body weight gain; red blood cells, haematocrit and haemoglobin 
increase; decrease in white blood cells (lymphocytes) and platelets; increased urinary volume, minimal 
to moderate atrophy of the thymus and minimal to slight adrenal cortex hypertrophy] were observed.

The incidence and magnitude of the changes was generally not different for the high-dose BDF+FF+GB 
combination (CHF 5993) when compared with BDF+FF administered alone. 
All the changes fully recovered after 4 weeks of recovery. 
The MAH considered none of the treatment-related effects as adverse and therefore defines the high-
dose of 920+51+100 μg/kg/day BDP+FF+GB as the NOAEL. 
Since  BDF-related  effects  were  observed  at  all  BDF+FF+GB  doses,  the  low-dose  (105+5.9+12 
μg/kg/day) was defined as LOEL. 
Safety margin calculations 
During clinical development it was demonstrated that the systemic exposure of humans for the CHF 5993 
DPI dosage form was comparable to that of the CHF 5993 pMDI dosage form (PK study). For this reason, 
human systemic exposure data from the CHF 5993 pMDI clinical trial (CARSAF study, pMDI application) 
were  used  by  the  MAH  to  calculate  the  safety  margins  versus  systemic  exposures  in  animals  at  the 
NOAEL defined by the MAH. 
On basis of the systemic exposure (AUC) at the NOAEL defined by the MAH for rats, the MAH calculated 
safety margins (exposure multiples) of at least 67 for B17MP, 26 for FF and 30 for GB. 
Plasma concentrations of BDP were only quantifiable for 1 or 2 hours after the start of inhalation, and, 
due to the paucity of data, the AUC0-24 for BDF was not determined. However, safety margins based on 
measured Cmax at the MAH defined NOAEL could be calculated (Table 2 and Table 3).

Dog studies 
4-week CHF 5993 DPI free combination inhalation toxicity in dogs with 4 weeks recovery 
In a 4-week inhalation study, male and female Beagle dogs were exposed by nose-only inhalation, 30 
min/day for 28 consecutive days to CHF 5993 DPI generated from the combination of Foster DPI (100+6 
μg BDP+FF in 10 mg blend) and GB DPI (25μg in 10mg blend) and delivered at achieved inhaled doses 
of 38+2+12, 154+8+50 and 465+26+162 μg/kg/day BDP+FF+GB. Two additional groups were treated 
with the single agents at the following doses Foster (BDF+FF) DPI 657+34 μg/kg/day and GB DPI 164 
μg/kg/day. The animals of the control group were exposed to lactose and magnesium stearate powder 
blend only at conditions similar to the high dose combination. A recovery period of 4 weeks followed the 
end of treatment.  
To prevent acute tachycardia associated with the pharmacological effects of formoterol, escalation doses 
were  introduced  prior  to  starting  the  constant  4-week  dose  phase  for  animals  of  mid  and  high-dose 
groups of the BDF+FF+GB combination or Foster DPI alone.  
The MMADs of the active compounds ranged between 1.31 and 3.45 μm, showing adequate respirability 
for the dog. 
Overall, the results were in line with those obtained in the 13-week repeat dose toxicity study in dogs 
presented below. 
13-week CHF 5993 DPI fixed combination inhalation toxicity in dogs with 6 weeks recovery 
The fixed-dose combination of CHF 5993 DPI (100+6+12.5 μg BDP+FF+GB in 10 mg blend) was given 
by  inhalation  to  dogs  for  1  hour/day  over  13  weeks  at  achieved  inhaled  doses  of  35.4+1.94+3.93, 
133+7.26+14.4  and  596+33.1+62.4  μg/kg/day  from  Week/Day  1/1  to  6/6  and  279+15.7+29.5 
μg/kg/day as high-dose from Week/Day 6/7 to 13/7 (423+23.6+44.5 μg/kg/d overall dose calculated 
as a time weighted average of doses) respectively of BDP+FF+GB. 
The animals of the control group were exposed to lactose and magnesium stearate powder blend only 
at conditions similar to the high dose combination.  
Two additional groups were treated with the single components at the following doses: Foster (BDP+FF) 
DPI 373+19.9 μg/kg/day and GB DPI 45.4 μg/kg/day. 
Escalation  dose  phases  were  introduced  for  groups  given  the  medium  or  high  dose  of  formoterol  to 
reduce the risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with the initial cardiac pharmacological effects of 
beta2-agonists. 
The aerosols generated were within the respirable range for the dog with MMADs ranging between 1.4 
and 2.8 μm for all the active compounds. 
Main study findings 
Mortality / Dose adjustment 
At the start of treatment animals in the high dose BDP+FF+GB group were given 596+33.1+62.4 
μg/kg/day for the first 6 weeks of the study but due to severe side effects in one animal (detailed 
below) it was decided to halve the doses to prevent further occurrences of death. Accordingly, 
between  Week  7  and  Week  13,  the  animals  in  the  high  dose  BDP  group  were  given 
279+15.7+29.5 μg/kg/day of CHF 5993 inhalation powder.  
The decedent was a female sacrificed in Week 6 due to severe clinical signs. The major factor 
contributory to death was considered to be the lung lesions (inflammation, necrosis, oedema and 
haemorrhage), most likely due to immunosuppression. The MAH considered that based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 22/66 
 
 
extensive  clinical  practice  with  inhaled  BPD,  these  effects  seen  in  dogs  have  no  relevance  in 
humans. 
No further deaths were observed after reduction of the high dose. 
Other  treatment-related  clinical  signs  observed  after  administration  of  the  highest  dose  were 
limited to reddening of gums, ears and/or ventral surface (with a reduced frequency after Week 
6). Electrocardiography showed heart rate increase, persisting to 4 hours post dose, during the 
escalation dose phase, Weeks 1, 6 and 13 for animals treated with CHF 5993 DPI. 
Heart rates were increased in a dose-dependent manner and generally declined over the study 
period. Slight decreases in PR interval and increases in QTcR were observed consistently with 
the  heart  rate  changes.  These  heart  rates  correlated  with  the  clinical  observation  of  skin 
reddening. Group mean triglyceride, total protein and albumin values were higher than control 
for one or both sexes given CHF 5993 DPI. Histopathological examination revealed BDP-related 
findings at all dose levels in the adrenals (atrophy and hypertrophy), liver (increased glycogen), 
gall bladder (epithelial vacuolation), thymus (atrophy), decreased cellularity in the lymph nodes 
(mesenteric, mandibular, tracheobronchial and axillary) and Peyer’s Patches and squamous cell 
papilloma in the oral cavity, which all support the immunosuppressed status of CHF 5993-treated 
dogs (especially at mid and high doses). 
Conclusions 
-  Electrocardiography  showed  heart  rate  increase,  persisting  to  4  hours  post  dose,  during  the 
escalation dose phase and weeks 1, 6 and 13 for animals treated with CHF 5993 DPI. 
-  Heart rates were increased in a dose-dependent manner and generally declined over the study 
period. Slight decreases in PR interval and increases in QTcR were observed, consistently with 
the  heart  rate  changes.  The  increase  in  heart  rates  correlated  with  the  clinical  observation  of 
skin reddening.  
-  Group mean triglyceride, total protein and albumin values were higher than control for one or 
both sexes given CHF 5993 DPI.  
-  Histopathological  examination  revealed  BDP-related  findings  at  all  dose  levels  in  the  adrenals 
(atrophy  and  hypertrophy),  liver  (increased  glycogen),  gall  bladder  (epithelial  vacuolation), 
thymus  (atrophy),  decreased  cellularity  in  the  lymph  nodes  (mesenteric,  mandibular, 
tracheobronchial  and  axillary)  and  Peyer’s  Patches  and  squamous  cell  papilloma  in  the  oral 
cavity, which all reflect the immunosuppressed status of CHF 5993 DPI-treated dogs (especially 
at mid and high doses). 
Recovery from these findings was observed after 6 weeks off dose.  
Overall, the effects of the fixed-dose combination CHF 5993 DPI were no relevantly different in incidence 
or severity from those seen with Foster (BDF+FF) given alone and were not exacerbated by the presence 
of GB.  
Safety margin calculations 
Due to the decedent at the high dose of 596+33+62 μg/kg/day BDP+FF+GB, the MAH considered this 
dose  level  as  adverse.  Although  no  further  mortality  was  observed  after  reducing  the  high  dose  to 
279+15.7+29.5  μg/kg/day,  the  MAH  considered  the  NOAEL  to  be  the  mid  BDP+FF+GB-dose 
(133+7.26+14.4 μg/kg/day). 
As for the rat data (presented above), human systemic exposure data from the CHF 5993 pMDI clinical 
trial (CARSAF study, CHF 5993 pMDI application) were used to calculate the safety margins versus the 
systemic  exposures  of  dogs  at  the  NOAEL  defined  by  the  MAH  for  the  CHF  5993  inhalation  powder 
formulation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 23/66 
 
 
 
For AUC, safety margins (exposure multiples) of at least 3 for B17MP, 4.2 for FF and 5.1 for GB were 
determined  at  the  NOAEL  defined  by  the  MAH  (Error!  Reference  source  not  found.5).  Plasma 
concentrations of BDP were only quantifiable at 1 or 2 hours after the start of inhalation and due to the 
paucity of data, the AUC0-24 for BDP was not determined. 
For Cmax, the corresponding safety margins are reported below in Table 5. 
Table 4: Safety margin calculation on basis of AUC at NOAEL 
Table 5: Safety margin calculation on basis of Cmax at NOAEL 
2.3.5.  Local tolerance 
No separate studies were conducted with CHF 5993 DPI; however, its local tolerance was tested during 
the 4- and 13-week inhalation repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs performed with the inhalation 
powder formulation (presented above). 
The lung doses corrected for lung deposition and for the alveolar surface area (see Error! Reference 
source not found.) were calculated. Data for the highest inhaled doses of CHF 5993 DPI tested in the 
13-week toxicity studies in rat and dog, respectively, are presented in Table 7 and Table 8.

2.3.6.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA (included below) for the active substances beclometasone dipropionate (pro-drug), 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium bromide had been provided based on the ERA 
which had been considered complete and acceptable. A risk to the environment was not indicated. No 
new experimental studies were provided for the present extension application.  
At time of initial authorisation, all PECsw values were clearly below the Phase I action limit of 0.01 
µg/l. Therefore, for formoterol fumarate dihydrate (FF) and glycopyrronium bromide (GB) an 
assessment in Phase II Tier A was not required. However, due to the potential endocrine disrupting 
properties of glucocorticoids, a tailored ERA for the active metabolite of beclometasone dipropionate 
(pro-drug), i.e. beclometasone-17-monopropionate (B17MP), had been performed. On the basis of the 
tailored ERA it was concluded that beclometasone is not readily biodegradable, not toxic to fish and not 
expected to bioconcentrate in fish. However, the parent compound is considered persistent in 
water/sediment systems as the relevant transformation products ‘Met-L’ and ‘Epoxide of 
beclometasone’ are considered very persistent and persistent in water, respectively. Beclometasone-
17-monopropionate, formoterol fumarate and glycopyrronium bromide are not potential PBT 
substances. 
The present extension to add a new pharmaceutical form is not expected to increase the environmental 
exposure as the maximum daily dose remains the same. Thus, the previous conclusions on the 
environmental risk are still valid. It can be expected that the present extension will not pose a risk to 
the environment when used in accordance with the SmPC.

2.3.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
No  new  non-clinical  studies  concerning  Primary  Pharmacodynamics,  Secondary  Pharmacodynamics, 
Safety Pharmacology and Pharmacodynamics Drug Interactions of CHF 5993 DPI have been submitted 
for this line extension. Instead, the MAH refered to respective data submitted during the initial MAA for 
CHF 5993 pMDI (Trimbow - EMEA/H/C/004257/0000). This is considered acceptable by CHMP since the 
glucocorticosteroid activity (BDP), long-acting β2-agonistic activity (FF) and M3 antagonistic activity (GB) 
of the active ingredients of CHF 5993 DPI, when applied as single agents or in combination, have been 
well-characterized in the non-clinical and clinical studies submitted previously. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Concerning absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, the MAH referred to the studies reports 
submitted during the initial MAA for CHF 5993 pMDI. This is considered acceptable since the basic ADME 
characteristics of the active ingredients BDP, FF and GB, when applied as single agents or in combination, 
have been well characterized in the non-clinical and clinical studies submitted previously. Furthermore, 
for characterization of the new DPI dosage form, additional toxicokinetic data have been provided by the 
MAH  for  CHF  5993  DPI  in  the  context  of  the  4-  and  13-week  repeat  dose  inhalation  bridging  toxicity 
studies performed in rats and dogs for the current line extension application. 
Overall, the approach followed by the MAH for characterization of PK is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity, Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity and Other 
Toxicity Studies  
No  new  non-clinical  studies  concerning  these  toxicological  parameters  have  been  provided.  The  MAH 
referred to the respective data that were submitted during the initial MAA for CHF 5993 pMDI. 
This is considered acceptable by CHMP since these toxicological characteristics of the active ingredients 
BDP, FF and GB, when applied as single agents or in combination, have been adequately characterized 
in the non-clinical and clinical studies submitted previously. 
In this respect, the currently approved SmPC for the CHF 5993 pMDI dosage form contains the following 
information. 
Reproductive and development toxicity 
Beclometasone  dipropionate/beclometasone-17-monopropionate  was  considered  responsible  for 
reproductive  toxicity  effects  in  rats  such  as  reduction  of  the  conception  rate,  fertility  index,  early 
embryonic development parameters (implantation loss), delay in ossification and increased incidence 
of visceral variations; while tocolytic and anti-muscarinic effects, attributed to the beta2-adrenergic 
activity of formoterol and the anti-muscarinic activity of glycopyrronium, affected pregnant rats in 
the late phase of gestation and/or early phase of lactation, leading to loss of pups. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity of Trimbow has not been evaluated, however, the single active components were devoid 
of genotoxic activity in the conventional test systems. 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 27/66 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  Trimbow.  However,  in  a  104-week  rat 
inhalation carcinogenicity study and an oral 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 
mice, glycopyrronium bromide showed no carcinogenic potential and published data concerning long-
term  studies  conducted  with  beclometasone  dipropionate  and  formoterol  fumarate  in  rats  do  not 
indicate a clinically relevant carcinogenic potential. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies 
To provide reassurance concerning the safety of the new DPI dosage form of CHF 5993, the systemic 
effects and the local tolerability on the respiratory system of CHF 5993 inhaled powder was investigated 
in rats and dogs in repeat dose inhalation bridging toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks duration including 
recovery periods.  
The effects seen in these studies appeared to be largely attributable to the known pharmaco-toxicological 
effects of corticosteroids, β2-agonists and M3-antagonists. The main observed alterations were related 
to effects on the immune system (probably due to systemic corticosteroid effects of BDP and its active 
metabolite B17MP) and on the cardiovascular system (probably related to the beta2-adrenergic activity 
of formoterol and the anti-muscarinic activity of glycopyrronium, most prominent in the dog studies). 
The toxicological profile of the triple combination was in line with the toxicological profile of the single 
active  components  without  a  relevant  increase  in  toxicity  and  without  unexpected  findings.  Since  no 
unexpected findings and no exacerbation of toxicity were found, studies of duration > 13 weeks were 
not carried out. 
Concerning  study  interpretation,  the  MAH  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  observed  effects  should  not  be 
considered  as  adverse,  since  they  appear  to  reflect  exaggerated  pharmacological  effects  and  were 
(mostly) reversible in the recovery period. On this basis, the MAH defined the high-dose of CHF 5993 
DPI in the 13-week rat study and the mid-dose in the 13-week dog study (since mortality occurred in 
the  high  dose)  as  the  respective  NOAEL  values  and  provided  AUC  and  Cmax-based  safety  margin 
calculations by comparison with the respective clinical exposure at the maximal recommended human 
COPD dose (400+24+50 μg/day of BDP+FF+GB). 
Nevertheless, the opinion of the MAH that the observed systemic effects of CHF 5993 DPI on the immune 
and cardiovascular system should not be considered as adverse was not supported by CHMP. One the 
main goals of inhalation therapy in COPD is to provide the desired local effects in the respiratory tract, 
but to avoid untoward systemic effects of the applied active substances. In the clinical setting, systemic 
effects during inhalation therapy on the immune system and/or cardiovascular system may have adverse 
consequences for the patient.  
Furthermore, in the new repeat dose inhalation bridging toxicity studies in rats and dogs submitted for 
the  current  line  extension  application,  systemic  effects  on  the  immune  and/or  cardiovascular  system 
were  already  observed  for  the  lowest  tested  CHF  5993  DPI  doses,  indicating  that  a  NOAEL  was  not 
established in these studies. 
Upon  request  by  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  a  detailed  comparison  of  the  new  repeat  dose  inhalation 
toxicity studies for the DPI formulation with those previously submitted for the pMDI formulation, which 
revealed that, by and large, the systemic exposure to the active substances BDP/B17MP, FF and GB had 
been comparable for both formulations and provided reassurance that application of the CHF 5993 DPI 
formulation is not associated with any new, unexpected relevant systemic toxicity. 
Local tolerance 
No separate studies were conducted; however, the local tolerance of the inhalation powder formulation 
was evaluated during the new 4- and 13-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 28/66 
 
 
Taking into account lung surface area comparisons, the MAH has calculated safety margins (exposure 
margins) for the clinical application of the CHF 5993 inhalation powder.  
For the 13-week rat study, exposure multiples at the NOAEL  for local tolerance (high-dose CHF 5993 
DPI) of about 8 to 9 for the active substances were estimated, whereas for the 13-week dog study at 
the  NOAEL  for  local  tolerance  (mid-dose  CHF  5993  DPI),  exposure  multiples  were  in  the  range  of  1. 
However, taking into consideration the lack of significant local tolerance-related findings at the mid CHF 
5993 DPI dose and the known toxicology of and available clinical/epidemiological experience with the 
active  substances  in  question,  CHMP  considered  this  latter  finding  did  not  give  rise  to  any  relevant 
concern. 
2.3.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data submitted as part of this application are comparable to the non-clinical data 
submitted for the pMDI device. Therefore, the non-clinical data provided for the new device CHF 5993 
DPI are considered appropriate.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme of CHF 5993 DPI (also referred to as Trimbow DPI) included two 
studies: 
• 
• 
One PK, single supra-therapeutic dose study in healthy adults (hereafter also referred to as 
PK study; CCD-05993BA1-01); 
One Phase II, repeat therapeutic dose study in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD 
(hereafter also referred to as TRI-D study; CLI-05993BA1-02). 
A  post-authorisation  safety  study  (PASS)  is  also  planned  and  discussed  in  other  Sections  below.  An 
outline for this PASS is provided in the Risk Management Plan submitted as part of this application.  
Results of the PK study, the design of the TRI-D study and the need for a PASS to support the approval 
of  this  LE  application  were  discussed  with  CHMP/SAWP  in  2017  (EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The main objective of the PK study CCD-05993BA1-01 was to assess whether total systemic exposure 
(without charcoal blockage [CB]) and pulmonary availability (with CB) following administration of two 
new formulations (CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 µg DPI, T1 and T2) is bioequivalent to the approved formulation 
(CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 µg pMDI, with and without spacer [valved holding chamber - VHC]) if the same 
single, but supratherapeutic total dose is administered in healthy volunteers of both gender.

Treatments, test and reference products 
The following five treatments were administered: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment R1: single dose administration (8 inhalations) of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 μg via pMDI, 
giving a total dose of 800 μg BDP, 48μg FF and 100 μg of GB 
Treatment R1 R: single dose administration (8 inhalations) of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 μg via pMDI,

(formulation 1), giving a total dose of 800 μg BDP, 48 μg FF and 100 μg of GB 
• 
Treatment T2: single dose administration (8 inhalations) of CHF 5993 100/6/12.5 μg via DPI 
(formulation 2), giving a total dose of 800 μg BDP, 48 μg FF and 100 μg of GB 
Supratherapeutic doses (i.e. fourfold the intended clinical dose) were administered in the mornings in 
order to achieve sufficient and measurable plasma concentrations. All administrations were performed 
under fasted conditions. A wash-out period of 14 to 18 days had to be respected between two consecutive 
administrations. 
Primary objective 
• 
To evaluate the total systemic exposure of B17MP (beclometasone 17-monopropionate, active 
metabolite of beclometasone dipropionate [BDP]), formoterol and glycopyrronium bromide (GB), 
as area under the plasma concentration-time curve observed from administration up to the last 
measurable concentration (AUC0-t) and maximum concentration (Cmax), after administration of 
two  different  formulations  of  CHF  5993  (100/6/12.5  μg)  DPI,  in  comparison  with  CHF  5993 
(100/6/12.5 μg) pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) (with/without VHC). 
• 
To  evaluate  the  pulmonary  availability  of  B17MP,  formoterol  and  GB,  assessed  as  systemic 
exposure (AUC0-t and Cmax) upon gastrointestinal charcoal blockage (CB), after administration of 
two  different  formulations  of  CHF  5993  (100/6/12.5  μg)  DPI,  in  comparison  with  CHF  5993 
(100/6/12.5 μg) pMDI (with/without VHC). 
Primary PK variables 
The primary analysis was based on B17MP (the active metabolite of BDP and not the parent compound), 
FF and GB. 
•  B17MP, FF, GB: AUC0-t, Cmax  
Subject disposition and demographic 
Twenty-five subjects were randomised to one of the five treatment sequences in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, 
i.e., 5 subjects per treatment sequence. All randomised and treated subjects completed the study. No 
subjects discontinued the study. No major protocol deviations were reported during the study. 
All subjects (100%) in Cohort 1 were White. The majority of subjects was male (60.0%). The subjects’ 
mean  (SD)  age  was  40.5  (10.2)  years.  Their  mean  (SD)  BMI  was  25.72  (3.13)  kg/m².  All  subjects 
(100%) in Cohort 2 were White. The majority of subjects was male (60%). The subjects’ mean (SD) age 
was 42.2 (11.0) years. Their mean (SD) BMI was 24.60 (3.29) kg/m².

Based on the results from the PK study, Formulation 2 showed the most comparable PK profiles to the 
reference  product  (CHF  5993  pMDI).  Therefore,  this  test  formulation  was  selected  to  be  used  in  the 
proposed PD study. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamics studies were submitted as part of this application.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The results of the PK study and how to move to the next step of the clinical investigation were discussed 
with CHMP/SAWP in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017). 
Pharmacokinetics  
The PK properties of the three actives substances in Trimbow are well known in the COPD population. 
Thus, no new data have been provided, in relation to the PK properties for the actives individually or in 
a fixed-dose combination (FDC). 
Analytical  methods  have  been  already  assessed  within  the  initial  MAA  for  Trimbow.  All  bioanalytical 
analysis presented within this application were performed at the same certified bioanalysis facility. The 
analytical  methods  employed  have  been  satisfactorily  validated.  Evidence  of  stability  of  the  drug 
substances in plasma samples has been provided. 
To support the clinical development of Trimbow DPI, the MAH conducted a PK study to investigate the 
test  product  (Trimbow  DPI)  in  two  different  formulations  (Formulation  1  and  Formulation  2)  and  to 
identify a DPI formulation with the most comparable PK profile to Trimbow pMDI. Both total systemic 
exposure  (without  charcoal  block,  CB)  and  pulmonary  deposition  (with  charcoal  block,  CB)  were 
Assessment report

evaluated.  Among  the  two  tested  formulations  of  Trimbow  DPI,  the  one  referred  to  as  Formulation  2 
shows the most comparable PK profiles to Trimbow pMDI. 
However, formulation 2 does not show a fully comparable PK profile for the different active components. 
The  total  systemic  exposure  of  the  FF  (Cmax  Ratio  T2  vs.  R1/R1R  161.56  [90%  CI  142.88;  182.68]; 
AUC0-t Ratio T2 vs. R1/R1R 122.32 [90% CI 113.43; 131.91]) and GB (Cmax Ratio T2 vs. R1/R1R 223.84 
[90% CI 189.04; 265.04]) components as a surrogate for safety were substantially higher with Trimbow 
DPI  as  compared  to  Trimbow  pMDI  without  Spacer,  while  the  pulmonary  deposition  of  the  active 
metabolite of BDP (B17MP) (Cmax Ratio T2 vs. R1/R1R 86.55 [90% CI 74.24; 100.91]) component as 
a surrogate for efficacy was lower (for the peak concentration only) with Trimbow DPI as compared to 
the Trimbow pMDI without Spacer.  
When comparing formulation 2 and Trimbow pMDI with Spacer, the total systemic exposure of GB (Cmax 
Ratio T2 vs. R2 127.38 [90% CI 105.31; 154.07]) component only was higher with Trimbow DPI. 
The  approved  SmPC  of  Trimbow  pMDI  stipulates  that  Trimbow  pMDI  may  be  used  either  alone  or  in 
conjunction with an Aerochamber Plus spacer as both these modes of administration were deemed to be 
safe  by  CHMP.  Therefore,  the  clinical  data  which  supported  the  Trimbow  pMDI  approval  and  were 
generated  both  with  and  without  a  spacer  could  be  used  to  establish  safety  and  efficacy  for  the  DPI 
formulation.  
Nonetheless  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  inhalation  of  Trimbow  pMDI  with  the  Aerochamber  Plus 
spacer resulted in an increase in GB total systemic exposure as Cmax and AUC0-t were substantially higher 
after inhalation of Trimbow pMDI with spacer compared to inhalation without spacer, with point estimates 
(90%  CI)  of  the  ratios of  160.4%  (131.5-195.7%) and  144.8%  (127.4-164.6%),  respectively  (Study 
TRIPLE 4).  
It  is  also  noted,  that  the  Trimbow  pMDI  clinical  development  in  COPD  included  a  study  dedicated  to 
assess the cardio-vascular (CV) safety, the CARSAF study. This study was designed to support the cardiac 
safety  evaluations  planned  in  Phase  III  studies.  CARSAF  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  active-
controlled, 3-arm parallel group, study to carefully evaluate the cardiac safety of supratherapeutic doses 
of GB pMDI administered concurrently to Foster pMDI. The study randomized 191 patients with moderate 
to severe COPD. The results showed that a 14-day treatment with two inhalations of GB 12.5 micrograms 
twice daily (i.e. total daily dose: 50 µg GB) or two inhalations of 25 micrograms twice daily (i.e. total 
daily  dose:  100  µg  GB)  on  top  of  Foster  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  a  raised  HR 
(measured by means of 24-hour digital 12 leads Holter) compared with Foster alone. 
Following strictly the ‘Requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products (OIP) including 
the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products for use in 
the  treatment  of  asthma’  Guideline,  a  PD  safety  study  focusing  on  the  safety  of  the  GB  component, 
particularly on cardiovascular safety, would be required. It was noted that in previous studies with GB 
pMDI,  GB  did  not  show  any  clinically  relevant  effect  on  CV  parameters,  in  particular  on  HR0-4h.  In 
particular,  in  GLYCO  2  study  the  difference  between  GB  and  Placebo  in  HR0-4h  (mean  of  three  post-
treatment HR values, post-hoc analysis) was equal to 0 (-0.3 bmp with GB 50 μg, +0.1 bpm with GB 25 
μg and GB 100 μg). The lack of GB effect was also observed when HR was evaluated during the 12 hours 
post-treatment (difference between GB and placebo did not exceed 1 bpm at any dose). Thus, the MAH 
was advised that the initially proposed PD safety study with the primary endpoint HR0-4h at Day 7 would 
not be able to discriminate between the GB dose of one formulation and another. 
Due to the fact that an appropriate PD study could not be designed to address potential systemic safety 
concerns,  the  MAH  has  proposed  a  post-marketing  safety  study  (PASS)  to  assess  the  incidence  of 
cardiovascular  outcomes  among  new  users  of  Trimbow  DPI  with  COPD  using  ‘major  adverse 
cardiovascular events’ as primary outcome to address the PK differences in GB. CHMP/SAWP concluded 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 36/66 
 
 
that the sensitivity of such a study would be regarded to be low but may be acceptable as the only means 
of addressing the long-term GB-exposure related safety concern. The duration of the PASS study was 
extended to 5 years upon request by CHMP.  
With regard to efficacy, the MAH considered that due to the flat dose-response curve of BDP, there are 
no concerns on the efficacy for this component of DPI as compared to the pMDI. For FF and GB, the MAH 
considered  that  there  are  no  efficacy  concerns  as  there  is  a  higher  exposure.  However,  given  the 
difference seen in PK (in general higher exposures as compared to pMDI and in particular differences in 
Cmax which suggest a difference in lung distribution for FF and GB, and lower exposure of BDP/B17MP), 
CHMP/SAWP raised concerns regarding efficacy and the contribution of each component. While this may 
not be an issue for an inhaler with one active substance; for a fixed dose combination particularly where 
two bronchodilators are included it is important that the dose of each individual component is appropriate 
such that there is clinically meaningful contributory effect of each component. In addition, as both FF 
and GB are bronchodilators, it is conceivable that the pulmonary exposure of each component should be 
appropriate for a clinically meaningful contribution to the combination. 
CHMP/SAWP finally agreed on MAH’s proposed strategy to perform a double-blind, randomized, 3-way 
cross-over, 4-week active controlled PD efficacy study in COPD patients with two co-primary endpoints 
FEV1 AUC0-12h and trough FEV1 at 24 hours at the end of treatment period at week 4 to demonstrate 
(i) non-inferiority of Trimbow DPI vs Trimbow pMDI (NI margin of 50ml) and (ii) superiority of Trimbow 
DPI vs Foster DPI. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of the three active substances in Trimbow have been previously characterised 
in the COPD population. The lack of new PD studies is therefore acceptable. The relevant sections of the 
proposed SmPC contain the appropriate information. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  properties  of  the  three  actives  substances  contained  in  Trimbow  are  well  known  in  the  COPD 
population. However, to support the clinical development programme of Trimbow DPI new device, a PK 
study was performed in accordance with the OIP guideline. However, there were some PK differences 
seen between the two formulations (DPI/pMDI). While the total systemic exposure of FF and GB were 
substantially higher with Trimbow DPI as compared to Trimbow pMDI, the pulmonary deposition of the 
active  metabolite  of  BDP  (B17MP)  was  lower  (for  the  peak  concentration only)  with  Trimbow  DPI  as 
compared to the Trimbow pMDI without Spacer. To address the potential impact on safety due to the 
higher exposure seen with the FF and GB, a PASS will be performed by the MAH in the post-marketing 
setting which is acceptable.  
With regard to efficacy and demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between the devices, a phase II 
PD efficacy study has been performed by the MAH to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Trimbow DPI vs 
Trimbox pMDI and is further discussed below.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
In order to address the potential concerns from the above PK differences, the MAH has conducted the 
TRI-D study.

Title of study 
A phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, 3-way cross-over 
study to evaluate the efficacy of CHF 5993 administered via Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) versus CHF 5993 
via pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) and CHF 1535 pMDI in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (Study identification No. CLI-05993BA1-02, EUDRACT No. 2017-004405-41) 
Methods 
This  was  a  phase  II,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active-controlled,  3-way 
cross-over  study  in  patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD).  The  study  aimed  to 
demonstrate the non-inferiority between CHF 5993 DPI versus (vs.)  CHF 5993 pMDI in terms of lung 
function after 4 weeks of treatment (changes from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time and 
trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28).

Study design 
Figure 4: General study design flowchart 
Days (d); PXDX (Period X Day X); Visit (V); Wash-out (W-O); Weeks (wks) 
The study comprised eight visits and a follow-up call. A pre-screening visit (Visit [V] 0) was planned to 
occur no more than 7 days prior to screening (V1, Week -2) and was followed by a 2-week open-label 
run-in period of CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 μg, 2 puffs twice daily (BID) (i.e. total daily dose: 400/24 μg 
beclometasone dipropionate [BDP]/formoterol fumarate [FF]). 
Superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI to CHF 1535 pMDI was tested to demonstrate assay sensitivity. CHF 1535 
pMDI was chosen as reference treatment, as it is currently marketed for the treatment of COPD patients 
who have significant symptoms despite long-acting bronchodilator therapy. CHF 1535 pMDI was used in 
this study at the marketed dose (BDP/FF 100/6 μg per actuation). 
Each  4-week  treatment  period  was  separated  by  a  2-week  wash-out  period,  during  which  patients 
received CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 μg as during the run-in (i.e. 2 puffs BID; total daily dose: 400/24 μg 
BDP/FF). A 2-week wash-out period between treatment periods was considered sufficient to avoid carry-
over effects of treatment during the study. The 4-week treatment period allowed adequate assessment 
of efficacy variables. 
During each treatment period, visits were scheduled on Day 1 (V2, V4 and V6) and Day 28 (V3, V5 and 
V7). An early termination (ET) visit, during which all the assessments foreseen at V7 should have been 
done,  was  performed  in  the  event  of  premature  study  discontinuation.  A  follow-up  phone  call  was 
performed 1 week after the last visit (or after the ET visit).

Study Participants  
Eligible patients included male and female patients aged ≥ 40 and ≤ 85 years with a diagnosis of COPD 
established according to the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease document updated 2017 at 
least 12 months prior to screening. Patients had to have a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30% and < 80% 
of the predicted normal value and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity < 0.7, and a smoking 
history  of  at  least  10  pack-years.  Current  and  ex-smokers  were  eligible.  For  ex-smokers,  smoking 
cessation must have been completed more than 6 months prior to screening. 
Previous medication: patients’ COPD therapy at screening with either: 
a.  ICS/LABA/LAMA (free or fixed) combination; 
b.  ICS/LABA (free or fixed) combination; 
c. 
Inhaled LABA/LAMA (free or fixed) combination; 
d.  Inhaled LAMA. 
Treatments 
At the randomisation visit (V2, Week 0), patients were randomised to receive the following treatments, 
each for a duration of 4 weeks, according to a particular sequence: 
•  CHF  5993  DPI  100/6/12.5  μg,  2  inhalations  BID  (total  daily  dose:  400/24/50  μg 
BDP/FF/glycopyrronium bromide [GB]); 
•  CHF 5993 pMDI 100/6/12.5 μg, 2 puffs BID (total daily dose: 400/24/50 μg BDP/FF/GB); 
•  CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 μg, 2 puffs BID (total daily dose: 400/24 μg BDP/FF). 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority between CHF 5993 dry powder inhaler (DPI) and CHF 5993 
pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) in terms of forced expiratory volume in the 1st 
second (FEV1) area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours (AUC0-12h) normalised by time 
on Day 28; 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI in terms of 
trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28; 
The AUC0-12h was selected since it measures the aggregate effect over the full 12-hour dosing interval 
suitable for a BID dosing regimen using serial post-dose FEV1 assessments. The trough FEV1, measured 
at 24 hours post-dose was selected to ensure that the LABA and LAMA (FF and GB) components did not 
mask any potential differences in the ICS (BDP) between the DPI and pMDI formulations. 
Importantly, centralised spirometry was used to improve data quality. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of CHF 5993 DPI on other lung function parameters and clinical 
outcome measures; 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study treatments.

•  Change from baseline in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and 
domain scores on Day 28; 
• 
Percentage of days without intake of rescue medication and average use of rescue medication 
(puffs/day). 
Safety: 
•  Adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs); 
•  Vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]); 
•  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters: heart rate (HR), Fridericia’s corrected QT 
interval (QTcF), PR interval (PR) and QRS interval (QRS). 
Sample size 
It was planned to randomise a total of 354 patients (59 per sequence) in accordance with the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, in order to reach a total of 301 completed and evaluable patients considering a 
non-evaluable rate of approximately 15%. 
Randomisation 
A  balanced  block  randomisation  scheme  was  prepared  via  a  computerised  system.  At  V2  (Week  0) 
patients were centrally assigned to one of six treatment sequences, arranged according to a complete 
set of 3 x 3 Latin Squares, through an IRT system using the lowest available randomisation number. 
Blinding (masking) 
In order to ensure the double-blind study design for the same period, patients receiving CHF 5993 DPI 
active were administered CHF 5993 pMDI placebo. Similarly, patients receiving CHF 5993 pMDI or CHF 
1535 pMDI were administered CHF 5993 DPI placebo. Patients started with DPI treatment then continued 
with pMDI treatment. Each day during the treatment periods patients administered 2 inhalations from 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 40/66 
 
 
the first DPI and 2 puffs from the first pMDI in the morning, then 2 inhalations from the second DPI and 
2 puffs from the second pMDI in the evening. 
Statistical methods 
Since a cross-over design was used, inclusion in the analysis sets was defined on a per-period basis. The 
following analysis sets were considered for analysis: 
•  Safety set defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment; 
• 
• 
Intention-to-treat (ITT) set defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of 
study  treatment  and  with  at  least  one  available  evaluation  of  efficacy  (primary  or  secondary 
efficacy variables) after the baseline; 
Per-protocol  (PP)  set  defined  as  all  patients  from  the  ITT  set  without  any  major  protocol 
deviations (i.e. wrong inclusions, poor compliance, non-permitted medications). 
Analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  variables  were  based  on  the  ITT  and  PP  sets.  In  the  non-inferiority 
comparisons between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI, the ITT and PP sets had equal importance, 
while the superiority comparison between CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of FEV1 AUC0-
12h  normalised  by  time  on  Day  28  was  based  on  the  ITT  set.  This  superiority  comparison  was  also 
performed on the PP set for sensitivity purposes. 
Analyses of the secondary variables were based on the ITT set. The safety variables were analysed in 
the Safety set. 
Efficacy analysis 
The comparisons between CHF 5993 DPI, CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of the primary 
efficacy  variables  were  conducted  according  to  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  The  primary  efficacy 
comparisons were considered in the following order: 
•  Non-inferiority  testing  of  CHF  5993  DPI  vs.  CHF  5993  pMDI  in  terms  of  FEV1  AUC0-12h 
normalised by time on Day 28; 
•  Superiority testing of CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised 
by time on Day 28, in order to establish assay sensitivity; 
•  Non-inferiority testing of CHF 5993 DPI vs. CHF 5993 pMDI in terms of trough FEV1 at 24 hours 
on Day 28. 
Primary efficacy variables 
FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time on Day 28 was calculated based on the actual times using the linear 
trapezoidal rule. The corresponding change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time on Day 
28 was analysed using an analysis of covariance with treatment, period and patient as fixed effects and 
baseline FEV1 value as a covariate. 
The adjusted treatment means, adjusted mean difference between treatments with associated 95% two-
sided confidence intervals (CIs) and corresponding p-values were estimated by the model. Non-inferiority 
of CHF 5993 DPI vs. CHF 5993 pMDI was claimed if the two-sided 95% CI of the adjusted mean difference 
between treatments lay entirely to the right of the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -50 mL. Provided 
that the non-inferiority had been claimed, the assay sensitivity was to be evaluated by comparing CHF 
5993 pMDI to CHF 1535 pMDI. Assay sensitivity was to be demonstrated by a statistically significant a 
statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between treatments in favour of CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 
1535 pMDI.

EMA/93446/2021

Trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28 was calculated as the mean of the two measurements at 23.5 hours 
and 24 hours post-dose. Change from baseline in trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28 was analysed using 
the same model as for FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time on Day 28. Non-inferiority of CHF 5993 DPI 
vs. CHF 5993 pMDI was to be claimed if the two-sided 95% CI of the adjusted mean difference between 
treatments lay entirely to the right of the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -50 mL. Comparisons of 
CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI and CHF 5993 DPI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI were also presented.  
Secondary efficacy variables 
• 
The same model as for the primary efficacy analysis was used for the following secondary efficacy 
analysis.  The  adjusted  means  for  each  treatment  and  the  adjusted  mean  difference  between 
treatments and their 95% CIs and p-values were estimated by the model: 
o  Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 (L) on Day 28; 
o  Change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-4h normalised by time (L) on Day 28; 
o  Change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time (L) on Day 1; 
o  Change from baseline in peak0-12h FEV1 (L) on Day 28 and Day 1; 
• 
FEV1  response  (change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  ≥  100  mL)  on  Day  28  was 
analysed using a conditional logistic regression model with treatment and period as fixed effects, 
patient as strata and baseline FEV1 as covariate. The odds ratio for the treatment effect CHF 
5993 DPI vs. CHF 5993 pMDI, CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI and CHF 5993 DPI vs. CHF 
1535 pMDI with their 95% CIs and corresponding p-values were estimated by the model; 
•  Changes from baseline in SGRQ total and domain (symptoms, impacts and activity) scores were 
analysed using the same model as for the primary efficacy analysis. However, baseline SGRQ 
total score (or specific domain score) was included as a covariate instead of baseline FEV1; 
• 
The percentage of days without intake of rescue medication was analysed using an analysis of 
variance  (ANOVA)  model  with  treatment,  period,  and  patient  as  fixed  effects.  The  same 
descriptive statistics and ANOVA model were performed for the average use of rescue medication 
during the treatment period. The adjusted treatment means, adjusted mean difference between 
treatments (i.e. CHF 5993 DPI vs. CHF 5993 pMDI, CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI and CHF 
5993 DPI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI) with their 95% CIs and corresponding p-values were estimated 
by the model. 
Safety analysis 
The  number  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  and  the  number  and  percentage  of  patients 
experiencing at least one AE, serious AE (SAE), non-SAE, ADR, serious ADR, severe AE, AE leading to 
study treatment discontinuation or AE leading to death were summarised overall by treatment and by 
treatment,  system  organ  class  (SOC)  and  preferred  term  using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory 
Activities dictionary (version 21.0). 
Vital  signs  (pre-dose  SBP  and  DBP)  and  their  changes  from  baseline  were  summarised  by  treatment 
using descriptive statistics. The 95% CI for the mean change from baseline was also presented. 
The absolute values and the changes from baseline for 12-lead ECG parameters (HR, QTcF, PR and QRS) 
were summarised by treatment using descriptive statistics and the CI of the mean (95% CI for absolute 
values and 90% CI for the changes from baseline). 
The  number  and  the  percentage  of  patients  with  any  of  the  following  at  each  timepoint  and  at  any 
timepoint after Day 1 pre-dose were presented by treatment:

Results 
• 
Baseline data 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  treatment  sequences.  The  majority  of 
patients were male (215 [58.7%] males vs. 151 [41.3%] females overall) and all were white. Overall, 
the mean age was 64.9 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.6 kg/m2. 
COPD history and smoking habits were both generally similar across treatment sequences. Overall, the 
mean  time  since  first  COPD  diagnosis  was  9.5  years  and  most  patients  had  chronic  bronchitis  as  the 
most plausible COPD phenotype (196 [53.6%] patients), though this varied across treatment sequences 
(ranging from 28 [45.2%] to 37 [60.7%] patients). 
Most patients were under double or triple therapy prior to study entry (127 [34.7%], 118 [32.2%] and 
105  [28.7%]  patients  overall  had  been  on  ICS/LABA/LAMA,  ICS/LABA  and  LABA/LAMA  therapy, 
respectively). Overall, the majority of patients (240 [65.6%] patients) had not had a COPD exacerbation 
in the previous year, while a large minority had one exacerbation (113 [30.9%] patients) and the mean 
time since an exacerbation was 12.1 months. 
All patients were either current or ex-smokers (185 [50.5%] and 181 [49.5%] patients, respectively), 
with an overall mean smoking duration of 38.8 years and a mean of 20.0 pack-years. Only 1 (0.3%) 
patient  changed  their  smoking  status  during  the  study  (the  patient,  from  treatment  sequence  CAB, 
stopped smoking). 
• 
Numbers analysed 
The overall safety set included all 366 randomised patients. The overall ITT set included 365 patients. 
One patient (treated with CHF 5993 pMDI) was excluded from the ITT set since they only performed the 
10-minute post-dose spirometry on Day 1 of Period 1 (V2) and then discontinued the study due to family 
reasons. The overall PP set included 361 patients. 
Patients included in the ITT set with major protocol deviations were not included in the PP set. A total of 
nine  (9)  (2.5%),  eleven  (11)  (3.1%)  and  three  (3)  (0.8%)  patients  had  at  least  one  major  protocol 
deviation with CHF 5993 DPI, CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI, respectively. 
Non-adequate compliance to the treatment period (defined as compliance < 80% or > 120% during a 
specific treatment period) occurred in eight (8) (2.3%), ten (10) (2.8%) and two (2) (0.6%) patients 
with  CHF  5993  DPI,  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  CHF  1535  pMDI,  respectively,  and  was  the  most  commonly 
reported  major  protocol deviation.  In  addition,  violation  of inclusion  criterion was  reported  in  one  (1) 
(0.3%) patient with all treatments (inclusion criterion #5; patient under treatment with ICS/LABA and 
LABA/LAMA at screening).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variables 
Change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h (L) on Day 28 
In the ITT population, a greater increase in FEV1 AUC0-12h  from baseline to Day 28 was observed with 
BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI compared to BDP/FF pMDI, with adjusted mean changes (95% CI) 
of 0.146 L (0.136; 0.157), 0.167 L (0.156; 0.177) and 0.062 L (0.051; 0.072), respectively (Table 14). 
The adjusted mean difference (95% CI) between BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI was -0.020 L  
(-0.035; -0.006). Since the 95% CIs are entirely above the pre-defined non-inferiority limit of -0.050 L, 
the non-inferiority of BDP/FF/GB DPI relative to BDP/FF/GB DPI was demonstrated.

with an adjusted mean difference of 0.085 L (95% CI: 0.070, 0.099), p < 0.001. 
A clear trend in favour of the two triple treatments compared to BDP/FF pMDI was observed in terms of 
mean absolute FEV1 values post-dose on Day 28 in the ITT population (Figure 7).

Similarly, in the PP population, a greater increase in FEV1 AUC0-12h from baseline to Day 28 was 
observed with BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI compared to BDP/FF pMDI. The adjusted mean 
difference (95% CI) between BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI was -0.022 L (-0.037; -0.007). 
Since the 95% CI are entirely above the non-inferiority limit of -0.050 L, the non-inferiority of 
BDP/FF/GB DPI relative to BDP/FF/GB pMDI was demonstrated. 
Assay sensitivity was considered to be established, given the observed statistically significantly greater 
increase in FEV1  AUC0-12h with BDP/FF/GB pMDI vs. BDP/FF pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 0.106 
L [95% CI: 0.091; 0.121], p < 0.001) and the superiority of BDP/FF/GB DPI vs. BDP/FF pMDI was also 
demonstrated (adjusted mean difference of 0.084 L [95% CI: 0.069, 0.099], p < 0.001). 
Change from baseline in trough FEV1 (L) at 24 hours on Day 28 
There was no noticeable change in trough FEV1 from baseline to 24 hours on Day 28 in the ITT population 
with BDP/FF/GB DPI or BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted mean changes [95% CI] of -0.006 L [-0.019; 0.006] 
and  -0.009  L  [-0.021;  0.003],  respectively)  and  a  decrease  with  BDP/FF  pMDI  (-0.063  L  [-0.076;  -
0.051]) (Table 15). A similar effect was observed with BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted 
mean difference of 0.003 L [95% CI: -0.015; 0.020]). Since the 95% CI of the adjusted mean difference 
are entirely above the pre-defined non-inferiority limit of -0.050 L, the non-inferiority of BDP/FF/GB DPI 
relative to BDP/FF/GB pMDI was demonstrated.

The adjusted mean difference between BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF pMDI was statistically significant in 
favour  of  BDP/FF/GB  DPI  (0.057  L  [95%  CI:  0.040;  0.074],  p  <  0.001)  and  was  of  a  comparable 
magnitude to the adjusted mean difference between BDP/FF/GB pMDI and BDP/FF pMDI (0.054 L [95% 
CI: 0.037; 0.072], p < 0.001). 
Similarly, in the PP population, no notable change in trough FEV1 from baseline to Day 28 was observed 
with BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI, while a decrease was observed with BDP/FF pMDI. A similar 
effect was observed with BDP/FF/GB DPI and with BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 0.003 
L [95% CI: -0.015; 0.020]). Since the 95% CI of the adjusted mean difference are entirely above the 
non-inferiority limit of -0.050 L, the non-inferiority of BDP/FF/GB DPI relative to BDP/FF/GB pMDI was 
demonstrated. 
The adjusted mean difference between BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF pMDI was statistically significant in 
favour  of  BDP/FF/GB  DPI  (0.057  L  [95%  CI:  0.040;  0.074],  p  <  0.001)  and  was  of  a  comparable

CI: 0.037; 0.071], p < 0.001). 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 (L) on Day 28 
The adjusted mean change in pre-dose morning FEV1 from baseline to Day 28 was an increase with both 
triple  therapies,  and  a  decrease  with  BDP/FF  pMDI  (Table  16).  A  similar  effect  was  observed  with 
BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted mean difference of -0.009 L [95% CI: -0.027; 0.010]). 
Statistically  significantly  greater  increases  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  were  observed  with  both  triple 
therapies compared to BDP/FF pMDI (adjusted mean differences [95% CI] of 0.072 L [0.053; 0.090], p 
< 0.001 and 0.081 L [0.062; 0.099], p < 0.001 for BDP/FF/GB DPI vs. BDP/FF pMDI and BDP/FF/GB 
pMDI vs. BDP/FF pMDI, respectively).

Change from baseline in SGRQ total score and domain scores on Day 
The change from baseline in SGRQ total score was a small decrease (i.e. indicative of an improvement 
in quality of life) with both BDP/FF/GB DPI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI, and no notable change with BDP/FF 
pMDI.  This  was  reflected  in  the  adjusted  mean  differences  between  treatments  with  a  similar  effect 
observed  for the two  triple  therapies  (0.43  [95%  CI:  -0.60;  1.47]  for  BDP/FF/GB  DPI  vs.  BDP/FF/GB 
pMDI),  and  statistically  significantly  greater  decreases  in  SGRQ  total  score  with  both  triple  therapies 
compared to BDP/FF pMDI (adjusted mean differences [95% CI] of -1.08 [-2.12; -0.04], p=0.042 and -
1.52  [-2.56;  -0.48],  p=0.004  for  BDP/FF/GB  DPI  vs.  BDP/FF  pMDI  and  BDP/FF/GB  pMDI  vs.  BDP/FF 
pMDI, respectively). 
Percentage of days without intake of rescue medication 
The percentage of rescue medication-free days was similar with the two triple therapies BDP/FF/GB DPI 
and BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 1.64% [95% CI: -0.61; 3.89. Treatment with both 
triple therapies resulted in  a statistically significantly greater percentage of rescue medication-free days 
compared to treatment with BDP/FF pMDI (adjusted mean differences [95% CI] of 5.25% [3.01; 7.49], 
p < 0.001 and 3.61% [1.36; 5.86], p=0.002 for BDP/FF/GB DPI vs. BDP/FF pMDI and BDP/FF/GB pMDI 
vs. BDP/FF pMDI, respectively). 
Average use of rescue medication 
The  average  use  of  rescue  medication  was  similar  with  the  two  triple  therapies  BDP/FF/GB  DPI  and 
BDP/FF/GB pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 0.017 puffs/day [95% CI: -0.077; 0.112]). Treatment 
with both triple therapies resulted in statistically significantly less rescue medication use compared to 
treatment  with  BDP/FF  pMDI  (adjusted  mean    differences  [95%    CI]  of  -0.149  puffs/day  [-0.243;  -
0.055], p=0.002 and -0.166 puffs/day [-0.261; -0.072], p <0.001 for BDP/FF/GB DPI vs. BDP/FF pMDI 
and BDP/FF/GB pMDI vs. BDP/FF pMDI, respectively).

Supportive study 
Results of a flow profiling and handling study with the NEXT DPI device (which is the same device as the 
one presented in this application) has been provided (Study CP01-NEXT DPI). In this study,  
- all patients with asthma (in all age categories, including children 5-11 years old) and COPD, irrespective 
of  disease  severity  (moderate  or  severe),  were  able  to  activate  the  NEXT  DPI  breath  actuated 
mechanism.  
- the mean PIF measured with the In-Check Dial device was similar in all patients categories, irrespective 
of diagnosis, age (including children 5-11 years old) and disease severity (moderate or severe), and it 
was greater than the threshold required for activating the NEXT DPI BAM, thus confirming that all patients 
were able to generate an inspiratory flow sufficient for the device activation.  
- the results of the NEXT DPI usability evaluation questionnaire showed that most of the patients in all 
of the categories were successfully trained and able to use the device correctly. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH has submitted a single PD study (Study CLI-05993BA1-02; TRI-D) to support this line extension 
application and to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of novel Trimbow (BDP/FF/GB) DPI formulation 
administered via the NEXThaler device to the Trimbow pMDI product already authorised for the treatment 
of adult patients with moderate to severe COPD and the treatment of asthma in adults.  
The new device proposed (Trimbow DPI) is only for use in the COPD indication.

The TRI-D study was designed to specifically address any potential PK difference in BDP (via the measure 
of trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28) and bronchodilator components FF and GB between Trimbow DPI 
and  Trimbow  pMDI  (measuring  the  FEV1  AUC0-12h  on  Day  28),  in  line  with  the  CHMP  SA  received 
(EMEA/H/SA/3068/1/2015/III, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design 
The study was a double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, 3-way cross-over study in patients with 
moderate to severe COPD. The study included a 2-week run-in period in which subjects were treated 
with CHF1535 pMDI (Foster) (100/6 μg, 2 puffs BID -total daily dose: 400/24 μg BDP/FF) with patients 
also receiving this treatment during the 2-week washout periods. Subjects were randomised to receive 
one of CHF 5993 DPI 100/6/12.5 μg; CHF 5993 pMDI 100/6/12.5 μg, both 2 puffs BID (total daily dose: 
400/24/50  μg  BDP/FF/GB);  or  CHF  1535  pMDI  100/6  μg,  2  puffs  BID  (total  daily  dose:  400/24  μg 
BDP/FF).  
Due to the fact that it is not possible to demonstrate the differential bronchodilator contribution of the 
LABA or the LAMA between the Trimbow DPI and Trimbow pMDI based on FEV1 AUC0-12h on Day 28, 
as  the  two  bronchodilators  were  administered  simultaneously,  the  dual  combination of  BDP/FF  Foster 
was added as active comparator.  
Subjects included in the trial had a diagnosis of COPD for at least 12 months prior to screening, a post 
bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30% and < 80% of the predicted normal value and FEV1/FVC < 0.7, and a smoking 
history  of  at  least  10  pack  years.  These  patients  represent  a  less  severe  population  with  less  post 
bronchodilator airflow limitation relative to the population included in the original pivotal studies (Triple 
5-8, FEV1 % of predicted normal value post-bronchodilator <50%). However, for the purpose of a non-
inferiority comparison this is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Subjects were not required to have experienced an exacerbation in the last 12 months, though those 
experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation up to 6 weeks prior to screening were excluded. 
The study aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the DPI formulation relative to the authorised pMDI 
formulation in terms of change from baseline FEV1 AUC (0-12h) normalised by time and trough FEV1 24 
hours following last dose on day 28. The EMA ‘Guideline on the requirements for clinical documentation 
for orally inhaled products (OIP) including the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic equivalence 
between two inhaled products for oral use in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) in adults and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents’ (Doc. Ref. 
CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) states that for FDC products with a reference product, the study should be 
designed to demonstrate equivalence for each of the components of the fixed-dose combination product.  
The MAH stated that the change from baseline FEV1 AUC (0-12h) normalised by time and trough FEV1 at 
24  hours  on  day  28  aim  to  assess  the  equivalence  of  the  LAMA/LABA  (bronchodilator)  and  ICS 
components respectively. The MAH has justified the study duration on the basis of clinically significant 
lung function changes observed following 4-weeks treatment with the Trimbow pMDI in the Triple 5 study 
which were maintained for 52 weeks. Thus, the selection of a 4-week treatment duration for the TRI-D 
clinical study is considered to be appropriate by CHMP. 
It is noted, that these co-primary endpoints and approach have previously been agreed in CHMP scientific 
follow-up advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432923/2017).

Treatments 
The study included a 2-week run in period in which patients were administered CHF 1535 100/6 μg pMDI 
administered as 2 puffs BID which corresponded to a total daily dose of BDP/FF 400/24 μg.  
Following the run-in period, patients were randomised to receive a particular sequence; CHF 5993 DPI 
100/6/12.5  μg;  CHF  5993  pMDI  100/6/12.5  μg,  both  2  puffs  BID  (total  daily  dose:  400/24/50  μg 
BDP/FF/GB); or CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 μg, 2 puffs BID (total daily dose: 400/24 μg BDP/FF). Salbutamol 
(100 μg) or terbutaline were available as rescue medication if needed, with only salbutamol used in the 
trial. 
Upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided a summary of the use of salbutamol rescue medication within 
6 hours of spirometry measures. As these were included as major deviations and hence excluded from 
the PP analysis set in which results were comparable with the ITT analysis for the co-primary endpoints, 
CHMP considered that rescue medication use during spirometry measurements did not have a significant 
impact on results. 
The MAH also provided an overview of medication use in subjects with COPD exacerbations during the 
treatment  or  washout  periods.  There  was  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  exacerbations  during  the 
treatment periods in the two triple combination groups relative to the BDP/FF pMDI group. The mean 
treatment duration with systemic corticosteroids ranged from 2.9 to 5 days. The MAH argued that given 
the short duration of such therapies and the relatively low incidence of COPD exacerbations these were 
unlikely  to  have  impacted  on  the  results  of  the  completed  study.  To  further  support  this,  the  MAH 
presented  additional  post-hoc  analyses  of  the  co-primary  endpoints  excluding  subjects  which 
experienced  a  COPD  exacerbation  during  a  given  treatment  period  or  in  the  case  of  those  who 
experienced  an  exacerbation  during  a  wash-out  period  in  the  subsequent  treatment  period.  These 
analyses revealed that exclusion of these subjects did not significantly alter the results with the point 
estimates for the adjusted mean differences comparable with the initial ITT analysis.  
Efficacy variables 
A hierarchical testing procedure was pre-specified and applied to the primary endpoints. The co-primary 
endpoints  were  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  the  CHF  5993  DPI  relative  to  the  authorised  pMDI 
formulation  in  terms  of  change  from  baseline  in  FEV1  area  under  the  curve  between  0  and  12  hours 
(AUC0-12h) normalised by time on Day 28 and trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28. The non-inferiority 
margin was set at -50 ml for both endpoints. For FEV1 AUC0-12h this is based on data acquired in studies 
to support the Trimbow pMDI initial MAA and is in line with what was previously accepted in the Triple 6 
study and thus is considered acceptable by CHMP. The data to support this margin for trough FEV1 on 
Day  28  are  scarcer,  with  0.076-0.1L  cited  as  the  usually  accepted  minimally  clinically  important 
difference. This is accepted. Change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalised by time is accepted as an 
appropriate endpoint to determine the equivalence of the combination in terms of lung function.  
The key secondary endpoints included a suite of additional lung function measures [change from baseline 
in pre-dose morning FEV1 (L) on Day 28; change from baseline in FEV1 area under the curve between 0 
and  4  hours  (AUC0-4h)  normalised  by  time  (L)  on  Day  28;  change  from  baseline  in  FEV1  AUC0-12h 
normalised by time (L) on Day 1; change from baseline in peak FEV1 up to 12 hours (L) on Day 28 and 
Day 1; responder analysis on the change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 response (change from 
baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 ≥ 100 mL) on Day 28] and change from baseline in SGRQ total score. 
Participant flow 
449  patients  were  screened  with  366  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  six  treatment  sequences.  The 
discontinuation  rate  was  low  in  this  study  with  90%+  patients  completing  each  of  the  treatment 
sequences. The primary reasons for discontinuation were consent withdrawal and AEs. There was one

death  during  the  study  (with  BDP/FF/GB  pMDI)  which  was  not  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study 
treatment. 
Conduct of the study 
The MAH has stated that change was made to the wording of the primary objectives in the CSR relative 
to those listed in the protocol for clarity, with the addition of ‘change from baseline’ prior to the two co-
primary endpoints. This was made prior to database lock and is considered acceptable. The number of 
patients  with  major  protocol  deviations  was  low  with  non-adequate  compliance  the  primary  observed 
deviation.  
Baseline data 
The  majority  of  recruited  subjects  were  male  (58.7%)  and  were  exclusively  white.  The  majority  of 
subjects (65.8%, 30.7% with 1, 3.6% with 2) had not had a COPD exacerbation in the previous year. 
Patients previously on triple combination (TC) therapy and dual combination therapy (either ICS/LAMA, 
ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA) for the treatment of COPD were permitted inclusion into the study. There were 
no requirements related to previous dosing with all eligible patients subsequently entering the two-week 
run-in period with the CHF 1535 pMDI. 34.7 % of patients recruited were on ICS/LABA/LAMA TC and 
therefore the run-in and wash out periods represent de-escalation of therapy in these patients. A higher 
proportion of patients originally on TC were randomised into sequence groups in which the CHF 1535 
inhaler was the first treatment (sequence CAB and CBA with 41.7 and 44.3% of patients originally on TC 
respectively, relative to 34.7% average in the ITT population).  
The MAH has provided a summary of pre-dose FEV1 values at V1 and V2 in the subset of subjects who 
were previously on either ICS/LAMA/LABA or LAMA/LABA therapy prior to inclusion in the TRI-D study. 
These data did not indicate a significant difference in pre-dose FEV1 values in these subjects following 
the 2-week open-label Foster (ICS/LABA) run in period. A further summary of pre-dose FEV1 at the start 
of  each  treatment  period  (i.e.  at  the  end  of  each  wash-out  period)  in  this  sub-population  was  also 
presented. While there is a trend for decreased mean pre-dose FEV1 values in this group (particularly in 
those treated with LAMA/LABA), given the margin of change in the point estimate and the variability in 
the measure, it is accepted that this is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. These data, along with the 
reasonably equal distribution of subjects previously treated with triple combination therapy among the 
treatment  sequences,  are  adequate  to  assuage  concerns  on  potential  effects  of  this  approach  on  the 
validity of the data generated. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary Efficacy Variables 
The MAH considered that non-inferiority of Trimbow DPI vs. Trimbow pMDI has been demonstrated for 
both primary efficacy variables because the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the adjusted mean 
difference between treatments was greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -0.050 L.

Figure 6: Primary efficacy endpoints, ITT and PP populations – TRI-D study 
The  superiority  of  Trimbow  pMDI  vs.  Foster  pMDI  was  tested  to  demonstrate  assay  sensitivity  (PP 
population).  Assay  sensitivity  was  considered  to  be  established,  given  the  observed  statistically 
significantly  greater  increase  in  FEV1  AUC0-12h  with  Trimbow  pMDI  vs.  Foster  pMDI  (adjusted  mean 
difference of 0.106 L [95% CI: 0.091; 0.121], p < 0.001) and Trimbow DPI vs. Foster pMDI (adjusted 
mean difference of 0.084 L [95% CI: 0.069, 0.099], p < 0.001).  
Showing therapeutic equivalence between orally inhaled products based on PD/clinical data is challenging 
because  of  difficulties  in  ensuring  assay  sensitivity. Assay  sensitivity  is  the  ability  of  a  clinical  trial  to 
distinguish  an  effective  treatment  from  a  less  effective  treatment  or  ineffective  treatment.  The  MAH 
justified  the  use  of  superiority  testing  of  Trimbow  pMDI  vs.  Foster  pMDI  in  terms  of  FEV1  AUC0-12h 
normalised by time on Day 28, in order to establish assay sensitivity, based on several considerations 
(CHF 5993 pMDI and 1535 pMDI are both approved for COPD, they have the same doses of ICS and 
LABA, there is historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects and also trial conduct is considered to be 
appropriate). However, it is still noted that the trial design did not strictly follow the OIP GL requiring 
investigation of two different dose levels to allow for estimation of assay sensitivity. Nevertheless, taking 
into account, that the study was conducted to give some reassurance that the differences in Cmax for 
FF and GB, and the lower exposure of BDP/B17MP are not clinically relevant, the issue was not further 
pursued by CHMP. 
Trough  FEV1,  measured  at  24  hours  post-dose  was  selected  to  minimise  any  residual  bronchodilator 
effect  of  the  LABA  and  LAMA  (FF  and  GB)  components  of  CHF  5993  DPI,  allowing  to  assess  the 
contribution of the ICS component (BDP). The 24-hour washout period post-dose on Day 28 was chosen 
as a compromise between, on the one hand, the need to limit the potential residual effect of these twice-
daily administered LABA (FF) and LAMA (GB) and, on the other hand, the need to limit the period during 
which  patients  would  have  been  without  daily  maintenance  treatment  (i.e.  in  order  to  safeguard  the 
safety  of  the  patients  with  moderate-severe  COPD  who  may  very  likely  not  tolerate  an  extended 
maintenance treatment- free period).  
There was no change from baseline trough FEV1 at 24 hours on day 28 for either CHF 5993 formulation, 
whereas a significant decrease in this endpoint was evident in the CHF 1535 group (-0.063 L [95% CI: 
-0.076; -0.051]). These data suggest a carryover effect for the LAMA component 24 hours post dosing. 
However, considering the 50-hour half-life of GB, a “true” washout would have required more than 10 
days off therapy.

Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Secondary  endpoints  related  to  a  number  of  additional  lung  function  parameters  based  of  serial 
spirometry measures and a quality of life assessment based on St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
as  well  as  a  responder  analysis  and  an  analysis  of  rescue  treatment  free  days.  Both  CHF  5993 
formulations resulted in statistically significant improvements relative to CHF 1535 in all lung function 
measures. 
The adjusted mean difference between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI was not statistically significant 
for  change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  on  day  28,  -0.009  L  ([95%  CI:  -0.027;  0.010], 
p=0.363), in FEV1 AUC(0-12h) on day 1, 0.002 L ([95% CI: -0.011; 0.014], p=0.782), peak FEV1 up to 
12 hours on Day 1, -0.002 L ([95% CI: -0.015; 0.011], p=0.742). 
There was a statistically significant adjusted mean difference between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI 
in FEV1 AUC0-4h on day 28, -0.026 L [95% CI: -0.043; -0.010] and for in peak FEV1 up to 12 hours on 
day  28,  -0.023  L  ([95%  CI:  -0.040;  -0.007],  p=0.005).  However,  these  differences  were  of  small 
magnitude and thus considered by CHMP to be not clinically relevant.  
There was no difference evident between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI in percentage of patients 
classified as FEV1 responders (i.e. change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 ≥ 100 mL) on Day 28, 
odds ratio: 1.029 ([95% CI: 0.690; 1.533], p=0.890). 
There was no difference evident between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI in decrease in total SGRQ 
score from baseline (0.43 [95% CI: -0.60; 1.47], p=0.410). Furthermore, it was noted that under the 
‘impact’  subdomain  related  to  the  psychosocial  impact  of  disease,  while  the  pMDI  formulation  was 
associated  with  a  statistically  significant  improvement  (adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  -1.10  [-
1.97; -0.22]), the CHF 5993 DPI formulation did not (adjusted mean change from baseline -0.57 [-1.44; 
0.31]). 
There was no difference evident between CHF 5993 DPI and CHF 5993 pMDI in % rescue medication 
free days, 1.64% [95% CI: -0.61; 3.89], p=0.154). 
Overall, CHMP considered that secondary endpoints were sufficient to support the non-inferiority of the 
DPI formulation relative to the pMDI product in terms of lung function. In Addition, CHMP considered 
that these endpoints are a measure of bronchodilatory LAMA/LABA induced effects. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted efficacy study (TRI-D) met its co-primary endpoints and could be considered sufficient to 
conclude the non-inferiority of the novel DPI product in terms of LAMA/LABA induced bronchodilatory 
effect relative to the authorised Trimbow pMDI in this patient population. While PK is more sensitive than 
PD  to  discriminate  differences  in  inhaler  formulation,  results  of  the  TRI-D  efficacy  study  gave  some 
reassurance  that  the  differences  in  Cmax  for  FF  and  GB,  and  the  lower  exposure  of  BDP/B17MP  are 
overall not clinically relevant. Therefore, CHMP considered that CHF 5993 DPI can be approved in COPD 
from a clinical efficacy viewpoint.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This section presents the safety results obtained in the TRI-D study (CLI-05993BA1-02) conducted in 
patients with moderate to severe COPD carried out as part of the clinical development programme for 
BDP/FF/GB DPI only. Safety results obtained in the PK study (CCD-05993BA1-01) conducted in healthy 
subjects were also presented in this application.

Patient exposure 
In the TRI-D study, the majority of patients completed treatment as planned per protocol with twenty-
four (24) (6.6%) patients discontinuing the study overall. The mean duration of exposure to total daily 
doses of BDP/FF/GB DPI, BDP/FF/GB pMDI and BDP/FF pMDI was comparable (28.9, 28.6 and 28.7 days, 
respectively).

In  the  TRI-D  study,  a  total  of  seventy  two  (72),  eighty  eight  (88)  and  sixty  seven  (67)  TEAEs  were 
reported in fifty five (55) (15.5%), sixty seven (67) (18.7%) and fifty five (55) (15.4%) patients with 
BDP/FF/GB DPI, BDP/FF/GB pMDI and BDP/FF pMDI, respectively. The majority of TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity. 
The  overall  incidence  of  ADRs  was  low  and  comparable  among  treatments.  Fifteen  (15)  treatment-
emergent ADRs were reported in twelve (12) (3.3%) patients. By treatment, four (4), four (4) and seven 
(7) ADRs were reported in three (3) (0.8%), 3 (0.8%) and seven (7) (2.0%) patients with BDP/FF/GB 
DPI, BDP/FF/GB pMDI and BDP/FF pMDI, respectively (Table 19). 
With all treatments, the majority of treatment-emergent ADRs by PT were reported in one (1) patient 
only; the only ADR reported in > 1 patient with any treatment was dry mouth, in two (2) (0.6%) patients 
with BDP/FF/GB DPI and one (1) (0.3%) patient with BDP/FF pMDI. No ADRs of dry mouth were reported 
with BDP/FF/GB pMDI. 
All but one of the events were mild to moderate in intensity and the majority were resolved by the end 
of the study. None of the ADRs were considered serious.

Overall, Trimbow DPI was safe and well-tolerated, and did not differ significantly from the approved drug 
products (Trimbow pMDI, Foster pMDI) if administered to patients with moderate to severe COPD for 4 
weeks. No new and/or unexpected clinical findings were observed.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the TRI-D study, the incidence of serious TEAEs was similar among treatments: six (6) serious TEAEs 
were reported in four (4) (1.1%) patients with BDP/FF/GB DPI, nine (9) serious TEAEs were reported in 
six (6) (1.7%) patients with BDP/FF/GB pMDI and one (1) serious TEAE was reported in one (1) (0.3%) 
patient with BDP/FF pMDI. None of these events were considered related to the study treatment (i.e. 
none  were  serious  ADRs).  One  (1)  TEAE  led  to  death  (PT:  pulmonary  haemorrhage)  with  BDP/FF/GB 
pMDI. This event was not considered to be related to the study treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
In the TRI-D study, for all haematology and blood chemistry parameters, the vast majority of subjects 
presented normal or abnormal non-clinically significant (NCS) values at screening and on Day 28 of the 
last  treatment  period.  No  new  CS  abnormalities  in  haematology  parameters  not  already  present  at 
screening were observed on Day 28 of the last treatment period and reported as  TEAEs. Of note, CS 
abnormalities in blood chemistry parameters observed on Day 28 of the last treatment period (but normal 
or abnormal NCS at screening) were reported as TEAEs in five (5) patients (PTs: hyperglycaemia, renal 
impairment, hepatic steatosis, blood potassium increased and liver function test increased). None of the 
events were considered to be related to study treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
No safety data in special populations were submitted for the DPI formulation of CHF 5993 in this 
application.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety data related to drug-drug interactions and/or other interactions were submitted for the DPI 
formulation of CHF 5993 in this application.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the TRI-D study, the incidence of TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was comparable 
among treatments, with four (4) events leading to discontinuation in 1 (0.3%) patient with BDP/FF/GB 
DPI, seven (7) events leading to discontinuation in five (5) (1.4%) patients with BDP/FF/GB pMDI and 
one (1) event leading to discontinuation in one (1) (0.3%) patient with BDP/FF pMDI. There was one (1) 
ADR (PT: non-cardiac chest pain) which led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment reported 
during treatment with BDP/FF pMDI. No ADRs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
were reported with BDP/FF/GB DPI or BDP/FF/GB pMDI. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available for Trimbow DPI. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trimbow pMDI has already a marketing authorisation for the indication chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease  (COPD)  since  2017.  Thus,  the  safety  profile  has  already  been  established  for  the  COPD 
population. Safety results obtained in the PK study (CCD-05993BA1-01) conducted in healthy subjects 
and the TRI-D study (CLI-05993BA1-02) conducted in patients with moderate to severe COPD carried 
out as part of the clinical development programme for BDP/FF/GB DPI have been presented. 
In  the  PK  study,  Trimbow  DPI  was  safe  and  well-tolerated,  and  did  not  differ  significantly  from  the 
approved medicinal product (Trimbow pMDI) if administered to healthy volunteers of both gender at the 
same supratherapeutic dosage. 
In the TRI-D study, no new and/or unexpected clinical findings were observed. Incidence of TEAEs and 
results of further safety variables (incl. routine laboratory safety, vital signs and 12-lead ECG monitoring) 
were comparable between Trimbow DPI and the approved medicinal products (Trimbow pMDI,  Foster 
pMDI). 
From a safety perspective, a major limitation is the short duration of exposure in the Phase 2 study – 28 
days  across  the  three  arms  but  also  the  3-way  cross-over  randomised  design  which  limits  the 
interpretation of the safety data. Each 4-week treatment period was separated by a 2-week (± 2 days) 
wash-out period, during which patients received CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 μg as during the run-in. 
In  light  of  the  short  study  duration  and  the  PK  exposure  results  for  the  LABA  and  LAMA  components 
demonstrating transient differences in Cmax between the two products, a post authorisation safety study 
is being proposed by the MAH which will primarily focus on MACE incidences as the primary objective to 
assess the long-term effects of the new formulation DPI. This approach is supported and details of the 
PASS have been outlined in the RMP Annex 3. 
The TEAEs reported in the TRI-D study > 1% of patients with any treatment were COPD exacerbation, 
nasopharyngitis, headache and back pain. The TEAEs presented are expected with this combination and 
disease type. There were no major differences in AEs between the type of inhaler used.

All the ADRs observed with CHF 5993 DPI (dry mouth, oral fungal infection and cough) are in line with 
the known safety profile of the approved CHF 5993 pMDI. These ADRs are captured in section 4.8 the 
SmPC as well as in section 4 of the patient leaflet. 
Upon review of the non-cardiac chest pain narrative that led to treatment discontinuation in the BDP/FF 
pMDI arm, it appeared that this non-serious ADR resolved without intervention after a couple of days. 
There were no events of cardiac disorders reported as a TEAE in the DPI formulation group during the 
study. 
Six SAEs were reported in four patients in the DPI group: pneumonia, GI infection, chronic pancreatitis, 
rib & patellar fractures & pneumothorax. None were considered treatment related and one of the patients 
discontinued treatment. While there are no SAEs presented that demonstrate a concern for the DPI, the 
non-inferiority  study  is  too  short  to  be  conclusive  especially  for  capturing  MACE  as  these  were  not 
assessed  specifically.  The  PASS  study  should  adequately  address  this  concern.  The  main  rationale  to 
suggest a PASS in the 2017 follow-up CHMP SA, was to collect further reassurance on the therapeutic 
equivalence between the pMDI and the DPI formulations of Trimbow and to address the long-term LAMA  
safety exposure. Furthermore, it was emphasised that the hypothesis on which the sample size will be 
based  on  (in  particular  the  proposed  Major  Adverse  Cardiovascular  Events  incidence  rate)  should  be 
clearly justified and referenced. A consistent definition of MACE from previous PASS was also advised to 
be followed. It is noted that all-cause mortality has been included as a secondary objective of the PASS. 
The PASS protocol is planned to be submitted for PRAC assessment by 31 May 2021 as reflected in the 
RMP. 
As discussed above, MACE were not captured as a specific endpoint in the 4 week non-inferiority study 
but will be assessed in the PASS. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease and arrhythmias were 
excluded from the non-inferiority study and safety data for patients who had cardiovascular risk factors 
were not presented specifically (high BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc). These issues should be 
addressed in the PASS given how the patient population will reflect the real-world setting. 
Furthermore, the one death that occurred was not in the DPI arm but rather the BDP/FF/GB pMDI arm. 
Upon review of the death narrative for pulmonary haemorrhage, this occurred suddenly without cardiac 
or  respiratory  symptoms  preceding  the  event.  Asphyxiation  caused  by  a  massive  pulmonary 
haemorrhage was recorded however an autopsy report was not performed. Upon request by CHMP, the 
MAH has presented the case history of the patient that died in the BDP/FF/GB pMDI arm, however, a 
death  certificate  is  unavailable.  The  MAH  considered  that  this  event  was  not  related  to  the  study 
treatment. This could be agreed.  
Based on the safety results presented from the TRI-D study, there is currently no trend to suggest a 
negative benefit risk for safety however as previously highlighted this study has some limitations; long 
term data is required to fully characterise the PK results and identify any negative impact on the safety 
profile of Trimbow DPI. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the safety results presented in this application, there were no emerging safety signals however 
the short duration of treatment and follow up limited the assessment. In light of the higher exposure 
demonstrated in the PK study for both the LABA and LAMA components in the DPI formulation, the PASS 
study should adequately address this in the context of long-term exposure and capturing MACE. 
Overall, CHMP concluded that Trimbow DPI was approvable from a clinical safety viewpoint.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COPD  is  a  progressive  disease  characterised  by  increasing  obstruction  to  airflow  and  the  progressive 
development of respiratory symptoms including chronic cough, increased sputum production, dyspnoea 
and wheezing. The objective of pharmacological treatment is to prevent and control symptoms, reduce 
the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve general health status and exercise tolerance. 
Smoking cessation (including passive smoking) is extremely important. Ideally treatment of COPD would 
slow its progression but this has never been convincingly demonstrated. Long term domiciliary oxygen 
has been shown to prolong life but confines the patient to home for protracted periods. In recent years 
there has been increasing emphasis on physical training and rehabilitation. Moderate and severe COPD 
exacerbations are generally treated with antibiotics and oral corticosteroids. Maintenance treatment is 
by combinations of oral and inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) document recommends the use of one 
or more long-acting bronchodilators as maintenance therapy for the treatment and management of COPD 
[GOLD, 202012]. ICS are highly effective as anti-inflammatory treatments in respiratory diseases and 
12 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD): global strategy for the diagnosis, management and 
prevention of COPD. 2020 update. Available at: www.goldcopd.org. 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 61/66 
 
 
 
maintenance treatment with ICS is routinely used in association with LABAs for patients with a history 
of exacerbations despite treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Such ICS/LABA combinations may 
be  the  first  choice  of  initial  therapy  in  some  patients,  such  as  those  with  a  history  and/or  finding 
suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) [GINA, 201913].  
The triple combination therapy of inhaled ICS, LABA and LAMA, has become an option for maintenance 
treatment of COPD and as a “step-up” therapy from double therapies, when patients remain symptomatic 
with dual therapies (as a rational escalation of pharmacological management). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development programme of Trimbow DPI included two studies: 
•  One PK, single supra-therapeutic dose study in healthy adults (hereafter also referred to as PK 
study; CCD-05993BA1-01); 
•  One Phase II, repeat therapeutic dose study in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD 
(hereafter also referred to as TRI-D study; CLI-05993BA1-02). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pharmacokinetics 
To support the clinical development of Trimbow DPI, a PK study to investigate the test product (Trimbow 
DPI) in two different formulations (Formulation 1 and Formulation 2) and to identify a DPI formulation 
with  the  most  comparable  PK  profile  to  Trimbow  pMDI  was  conducted.  Both  total  systemic  exposure 
(without charcoal block, CB) and pulmonary deposition (with charcoal block, CB) were evaluated. Among 
the  two  tested  formulations  of  Trimbow  DPI,  the  one  referred  to  as  Formulation  2  shows  the  most 
comparable PK profiles to Trimbow pMDI. 
However, formulation 2 did not show a fully comparable PK profile for the different active components. 
The total systemic exposure of the FF (Cmax Ratio T2 vs.  R1/R1R 161.56 [90% CI 142.88; 182.68]; 
AUC0-t  Ratio  T2  vs.  R1/R1R  122.32  [90%  CI  113.43;  131.91])  and  GB  (Cmax  Ratio  T2  vs.  R1/R1R 
223.84 [90% CI 189.04; 265.04]) components as a surrogate for safety were substantially higher with 
Trimbow DPI as compared to Trimbow pMDI without Spacer, while the pulmonary deposition of the active 
metabolite of BDP (B17MP) (Cmax Ratio T2 vs. R1/R1R 86.55 [90% CI 74.24; 100.91]) component as 
a surrogate for efficacy was lower (for the peak concentration only) with Trimbow DPI as compared to 
the Trimbow pMDI without Spacer.  
When comparing formulation 2 and Trimbow pMDI with Spacer, the total systemic exposure of GB (Cmax 
Ratio T2 vs. R2 127.38 [90% CI 105.31; 154.07]) component only was higher with Trimbow DPI. 
Effects on lung function 
Non-inferiority of Trimbow DPI vs. Trimbow pMDI is claimed for both primary efficacy variables FEV1, 
AUC0-12h on Day 28 and trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28, because the lower bound of the two-sided 
95%  CI  of  the  adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatments  was  greater  than  the  pre-defined  non-
inferiority  margin  of  -0.050  L.  Assay  sensitivity  (based  on  PP  population)  was  considered  to  be 
established,  given  the  observed  statistically  significantly  greater  increase  in  FEV1  AUC0-12h  with 
Trimbow pMDI vs. Foster pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 0.106 L [95% CI: 0.091; 0.121], p < 0.001)

and Trimbow DPI vs. Foster pMDI (adjusted mean difference of 0.084 L [95% CI: 0.069, 0.099], p < 
0.001). 
The effect of 28 days treatment with either the DPI or pMDI formulations were also compared via number 
of  other  lung  function  measures  derived  from  the  same  serial  spirometry  assessments  with  no 
statistically or clinically significant differences between the two products noted. 
Overall,  this  study  included  lung  function  co-primary  endpoints  and  is  considered  to  have  adequately 
demonstrated non-inferiority of the CHF 5993 DPI relative to the authorised pMDI formulation in terms 
of change from baseline in FEV1 area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours (AUC0-12h) normalised 
by  time  on  Day  28  and  trough  FEV1  at  24  hours  on  Day  28.  Both  these  endpoints  are  considered  to 
assess  the  comparative  bronchodilatory  activity  of  the  two  products  over  the  study  treatment  period 
which will primarily relate to the LAMA and LABA components.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Showing therapeutic equivalence between orally inhaled products based on PD/clinical data is challenging 
because of difficulties in ensuring assay sensitivity. The MAH justified the use of superiority testing of 
Trimbow  pMDI  vs.  Foster  pMDI  in  terms  of  FEV1  AUC0-12h normalised  by  time  on  Day  28,  in  order  to 
establish assay sensitivity, based on several considerations (CHF 5993 pMDI and 1535 pMDI are both 
approved for COPD, they have the same doses of ICS and LABA, there is historical evidence of sensitivity 
to drug effects and also trial conduct is considered to be appropriate). However, it is still noted that the 
trial design does not follow strictly the OIP GL requiring investigation of two different dose levels to allow 
for estimation of assay sensitivity. Nevertheless, taking into account, that the study was conducted to 
give some reassurance that the differences in Cmax for FF and GB, and the lower exposure of BDP/B17MP 
are not clinically relevant, the issue was not further pursued by CHMP. 
There was no change from baseline trough FEV1 at 24 hours on day 28 for either CHF 5993 formulation, 
whereas a significant decrease in this endpoint was evident in the CHF 1535 group (-0.063 L [95% CI: 
-0.076; -0.051]). These data suggest a carryover effect for the LAMA component 24 hours post dosing. 
However, considering the 50-hour half-life of GB, a “true” washout would have required more than 10 
days off therapy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Trimbow in COPD is well understood; none of the active substances is a new active 
substance and all have been used over periods of at least years individually and in combination in treating 
COPD patients of various grades of severity. To date, about 3400 patients have been treated in clinical 
trial with the triple combination (counting the free and fixed combinations) many of them for 52 weeks.  
The TEAEs reported in the TRI-D study > 1% of patients with any treatment were COPD exacerbation, 
nasopharyngitis, headache and back pain. The TEAEs presented are expected with this combination and 
disease type. There were no major differences in AEs between the type of inhaler used.  
All the ADRs observed with CHF 5993 DPI (dry mouth, oral fungal infection and cough) are in line with 
the known safety profile of the approved CHF 5993 pMDI. These ADRs are captured in the SmPC and 
patient leaflet. 
Six SAEs were reported in four patients in the DPI group: pneumonia, GI infection, chronic pancreatitis, 
rib & patellar fractures & pneumothorax. None were considered treatment related and 1 of the patients 
discontinued treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 63/66 
 
 
Upon review of the non-cardiac chest pain narrative that led to treatment discontinuation in the BDP/FF 
pMDI pMDI arm, this non-serious ADR resolved without intervention after a couple of days. There were 
no events of cardiac disorders reported as a TEAE in the DPI formulation group during the study. 
Overall,  based  on  the  safety  results  presented  from  the  TRI-D  study,  there  is  currently  no  trend  to 
suggest  a  negative  benefit  risk  for  safety  however  as  previously  highlighted  this  study  has  some 
limitations;  long  term  data  is  required  to  fully  characterise  the  PK  results  and  confirm  whether  those 
might have any negative impact on the safety profile of Trimbow DPI. In light of the higher exposure 
demonstrated in the PK study for both the LABA and LAMA components in the DPI formulation, the PASS 
study should adequately address this in the context of long-term exposure and capturing MACE. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
While there are no SAEs presented that demonstrate a concern for the DPI, the non-inferiority safety 
study is too short to be conclusive on the safety of the new device especially for capturing MACE as these 
were  not  assessed  specifically.  The  PASS  study,  that  is  planned  to  be  performed  by  the  MAH,  should 
adequately address this concern. 
MACE were not captured as a specific endpoint in the 4 week non-inferiority study but will be assessed 
in the PASS. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease and arrhythmias were excluded from the 
non-inferiority study and safety data for patients who had cardiovascular risk factors were not presented 
specifically  (high  BMI,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus  etc).  These  issues  should  be  addressed  in  the 
PASS given how the patient population will reflect the real-world setting. 
3.6.  Effects Table

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The aim of the submitted studies was to establish the therapeutic equivalence of the novel CH 5993 DPI 
product relative to the authorised CHF 5993 pMDI product (Trimbow). The MAH therefore conducted a 
single dose PK study in healthy patients to investigate formulation related differences in lung disposition 
of each of the mono-components of this triple FDC product and to choose the formulation with the most 
comparable PK.  
The results of PK Study CCD-05993BA1-01 showed that none of the mono-components of the CHF 5993 
DPI formulation chosen for the to be marketed DPI product are bioequivalent with those of the authorised 
Trimbow pMDI product.  
Data  from  this  study  indicated  that  the  DPI  product  is  associated  with  higher  systemic  absorption 
following administration with charcoal block (i.e. a more sensitive measure of lung disposition) of the 
LAMA and LABA components relative to the authorised pMDI product (GB, 2.9-fold increase in Cmax and 
a 1.2 fold increase in AUC0-t; FF, 1.8 fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-t). For ICS metabolite B17MP, the 
DPI product is associated with a slightly lower Cmax following administration with charcoal block relative 
to the authorised pMDI product (86.55 [95% CI 74.24; 100.91]), whereas for AUC0-t, the 90% CI are 
contained within the bioequivalence range (107.61 [95% CI 95.18, 121.66]). As AUC0-t is considered the 
most relevant PK measure associated with ICS efficacy it is accepted for this line-extension application 
Assessment report  
EMA/93446/2021 
Page 64/66 
 
 
that while not bioequivalent for Cmax, the PK of the two products for the ICS component are essentially 
comparable in terms of AUC0-t and therefore efficacy is anticipated to be also comparable. 
Nevertheless,  as  bioequivalence  in  terms  of  Cmax  could  not  be  established  the  MAH  undertook  an 
additional phase II study to assess the comparative safety and efficacy of the DPI product relative to the 
authorised pMDI product in moderate to severe COPD patients (Study CLI-05993BA1-02).  
The TRI-D study was designed to specifically address any potential PK difference in BDP (via the measure 
of trough FEV1 at 24 hours on Day 28) and bronchodilator components FF and GB between Trimbow DPI 
and Trimbow pMDI (measuring the FEV1 AUC0-12h on Day 28), in line with scientific advice received 
from  the  CHMP/SAWP.  It  is  noted,  a  study  that  would  target  the  contribution  of  each  single  active 
ingredient, especially when two bronchodilators will be administered simultaneously, is quite challenging. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  contribution  of  each  component  to  the  overall  effect  of  Trimbow  has  been 
sufficiently studied during the development of the pMDI without the need to be reassessed. 
This  study  included  lung  function  co-primary  endpoints  and  is  considered  to  have  adequately 
demonstrated non-inferiority of the CHF 5993 DPI relative to the authorised pMDI formulation in terms 
of change from baseline in FEV1 area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours (AUC0-12h) normalised 
by  time  on  Day  28  and  trough  FEV1  at  24  hours  on  Day  28.  Both  these  endpoints  are  considered  to 
assess  the  comparative  bronchodilatory  activity  of  the  two  products  over  the  study  treatment  period 
which will primarily relate to the LAMA and LABA components.  
Based on the safety results presented from the TRI-D study, there is currently no trend to suggest a 
negative benefit risk for safety however as previously highlighted this study has some limitations; long 
term  data  is  required  to  fully  characterise  the  PK  results  and  confirm  whether  those  might  have  any 
negative impact on the safety profile of Trimbow DPI. In light of the higher exposure demonstrated in 
the PK study for both the LABA and LAMA components in the DPI formulation, the PASS study should 
adequately address this in the context of long-term exposure and capturing MACE. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Generally,  PK  is  more  sensitive  than  PD  to  discriminate  differences  in  inhaler  formulation.  However, 
results of the TRI-D PD study give some reassurance that differences in Cmax for FF and GB observed 
in the PK study, and the lower exposure of BDP/B17MP are not clinically relevant.  
The risk benefit is considered demonstrated for COPD patients. The DPI device should not be used in 
patients with Asthma. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Trimbow new pharmaceutical form (new device - inhalation powder) 
associated with a new strength (88µg / 5µg / 9µg) is favourable in the following indication: 
Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a 
long-acting beta2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extensions of the marketing authorisation for Trimbow DPI in 
COPD patients subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.

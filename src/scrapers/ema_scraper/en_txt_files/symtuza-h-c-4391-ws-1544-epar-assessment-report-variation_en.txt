Update of section 4.3 of the SmPC of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza to contra-indicate the 
concomitant use with dapoxetine , domperidone,  ivabradine and  naloxegol , as well as to update 
section 4.5 of the SmPC of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza on the interaction with dapoxetine, 
domperidone, fesoterodine,  irinotecan, ivabradine, naloxegol and  solifenacin based on approved 
product information. The Package Leaflets are updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to update of section 3 of the SmPC 
of Symtuza to correct the tablet dimensions (22 mm x 11 mm). Furthermore, the Package Leaflet and 
Labelling have been updated to reflect information on the in-use shelf-life in line with the approved 
Symtuza SmPC.  
Moreover, as per the revised Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’, the Package Leaflet of Prezista and 
Rezolsta have been updated to include information on the sodium excipient. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
This variation proposes updates of the Product Information for darunavir (DRV), for 
darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/COBI) fixed-dose combination (FDC), and for 
darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) FDC, to provide further guidance 
for use in combination with other medicinal products: 
•  Anti-anginals/Antiarrhythmics: ivabradine 
•  Opioid Antagonist: naloxegol 
• 
Treatment of premature ejaculation: dapoxetine 
•  Anticancer Agents: irinotecan 
•  Urinary Antispasmodics: fesoterodine and solifenacin 
•  Antiemetics: domperidone 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been carried out to support the changes. 
Darunavir used in combination with either ritonavir or cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Co-administration of boosted darunavir with medicinal products primarily 
metabolized by CYP3A and/or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to the 
co- administered medicinal product.  Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products 
for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events is 
contraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). 
Based on these sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the Product Information for darunavir, 
darunavir/cobicistat fixed-dose combination, and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide fixed-dose combination have been updated to provide further guidance for use in 
combination specific with ivabradine, naloxegol, dapoxetine, irinotecan, fesoterodine, solifenacin, and 
domperidone, each of which are metabolized by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6, and/or transported by P-gp. 
This guidance is aligned with the recommendations in the Product Information of those respective 
products considering the mechanistic basis of these interactions. 
The benefit-risk balance of Prezista, Rezolsta,Symtuza, remains positive.

recommended for Prezista and Rezolsta. In addition, amendments to annexes I, IIIA and IIIB are 
recommended for Symtuza. 
4.  EPAR changes 
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above  
Summary 
Darunavir used in combination with either ritonavir or cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Co-administration of boosted darunavir with medicinal products primarily 
metabolized by CYP3A and/or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to the 
co-administered medicinal product.  Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for 
which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is 
contraindicated.   
Based on these sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the Product Information for darunavir, 
darunavir/cobicistat fixed-dose combination, and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide fixed-dose combination have been updated to provide further guidance for use in 
combination with ivabradine, naloxegol, dapoxetine, irinotecan, fesoterodine, solifenacin, and 
domperidone, each of which are metabolized by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6, and/or transported by P-gp. 
This guidance is aligned with the recommendations in the Product Information of those respective 
products considering the mechanistic basis of these interactions. 
 
 
 
Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
 
 
 
5.  Introduction 
The MAH proposes updates of the Product Information for darunavir (DRV), for darunavir/cobicistat 
(DRV/COBI) fixed-dose combination (FDC), and for darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) FDC, to provide further guidance for use in combination with other medicinal 
products: 
•  Anti-anginals/Antiarrhythmics: ivabradine 
•  Opioid Antagonist: naloxegol 
• 
Treatment of premature ejaculation: dapoxetine 
•  Anticancer Agents: irinotecan 
•  Urinary Antispasmodics: fesoterodine and solifenacin 
•  Antiemetics: domperidone 
No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been carried out to support the changes. 
DRV when used in combination with low-dose ritonavir (rtv) or COBI is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Co-administration of boosted DRV with medicinal 
products primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic 
exposure to such medicinal products. DRV, DRV/COBI FDC, and D/C/F/TAF FDC must not be combined 
with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased 
plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic 
index). 
In the sections below, guidance is provided for co-administration of boosted DRV (as DRV [in 
combination with rtv or COBI], DRV/COBI FDC, or D/C/F/TAF FDC) specific with ivabradine, naloxegol, 
dapoxetine, irinotecan, fesoterodine, solifenacin, and domperidone, each of which are metabolized by 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6, and/or transported by P-gp. This guidance is aligned with the 
recommendations in the Product Information of those respective products. 
6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
6.1.  Ivabradine 
Ivabradine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be 
associated with the risk of excessive bradycardia. The Product Information of ivabradine 
contraindicates co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) protease inhibitors: 
SPC Procoralan (ivabradine):  
"Section 4.3. Contraindications 
…. 
Combination with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, 
itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), 
HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2) 
….". 
 
Therefore, co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with rtv or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or 
D/C/F/TAF FDC with ivabradine is added as a contraindication in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below). 
Prezista: 
SmPC 4.3 Contraindications 
…. 
Darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that 
are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the co 
administered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for 
which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events is 
contraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active 
substances include e.g.: 
alfuzosin 
amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine 
astemizole, terfenadine

… 
Amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, 
quinidine, ranolazine  
to treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal 
heart beat 
Assessor’s conclusion: 
Considering the mechanistic basis of this interaction with ivabradine, the update of the 
SmPCs and PLs of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza is acceptable. 
6.2.  Naloxegol 
Naloxegol is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A enzyme system and is a substrate of the P-gp 
transporter. Co-administration of naloxegol with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 and P-gp may 
increase the concentration of naloxegol. The Product Information of naloxegol contraindicates co-
administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: 
SPC Moventig (naloxegol):  
Section 4.3. Contraindications 
…. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole or 
telithromycin; protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir; grapefruit juice when 
consumed in large quantities), see section 4.5.….. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with rtv or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or 
D/C/F/TAF FDC with naloxegol is added as a contraindication in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below). 
Prezista:

Considering the mechanistic basis of this interaction with naloxegol, the update of the 
SmPCs and PLs of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza is acceptable. 
6.3.  Dapoxetine 
Dapoxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and flavin monooxygenase 1 (FMO1). Co-
administration of dapoxetine with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may lead to an increased dapoxetine 
plasma concentration, especially in a part of the population which lack a functional CYP2D6 enzyme, ie, 
CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. The Product 
Information of dapoxetine contraindicates co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: 
SPC Priligy (dapozetine):  
"Section 4.3. Contraindications 
…. 
Concomitant treatment of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, nefazadone, nelfinavir, atazanavir, etc. (see section 4.5). ….". 
Therefore, co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with rtv or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or 
D/C/F/TAF FDC with dapoxetine is added as a contraindication in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below).

Considering the mechanistic basis of this interaction with dapoxetine, the update of the 
SmPCs and PLs of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza is acceptable. 
6.4.  Irinotecan 
Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 are metabolized by CYP3A4 and uridine 
diphosphateglucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), respectively. Co-administration of irinotecan with 
medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase the systemic exposure to irinotecan and its active 
metabolite SN-38.3. The Product Information of irinotecan recommends not to co-administer potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors unless there are no therapeutic alternatives: 
SPC Onivyde (irinotecan sucrosofate salt in a pegylated liposomal formulation):  
“Section 4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use 
….. 
Interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong UGT1A1 inhibitors: 
ONIVYDE should not be administered with strong CYP3A4-enzyme inhibitors (e.g. grapefruit juice, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, voriconazole). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be discontinued at least 1 week prior to 
starting ONIVYDE therapy. 
….. 
Section 4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
…. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and UGT1A1 inhibitors: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 
inhibitor, have increased SN-38 exposure by 109%. Therefore, co-administration of ONIVYDE with 
other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. grapefruit juice, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) may increase systemic exposure

… 
- 
Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer) 
Assessor’s conclusion: 
Considering the mechanistic basis of this interaction, the update of the SmPCs regarding irinotecan 
being an anti-neoplastic is acceptable. However, the indication as immunosuppressant is not 
understood. The MAH should support/clarify this. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MAH response (13 March 2019): 
The Applicant agrees that in EU, irinotecan (ONIVYDE) is indicated only as antineoplastic. No 
supporting data for the indication as immunosuppressant can be provided. The product information of 
PREZISTA, REZOLSTA and Symtuza have been updated to remove the DDI information for irinotecan 
as immunosuppressant. 
Assessor’s conclusion: 
DDI information for irinotecan as immunosuppressant has been removed in the SmPCs (section 4.5) of 
PREZISTA, REZOLSTA and Symtuza. Agreed. 
6.5.  Fesoterodine and solifenacin 
Fesoterodine: 
Co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to a more 
than 2-fold increase of the plasma concentration of the active metabolite of fesoterodine. The Product 
Information of fesoterodine indicates that the dose of fesoterodine should be restricted to 4 mg when 
co-administrated with a potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor: 
SPC Toviaz (fesoterodine):  
" 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
…. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating fesoterodine to patients in whom an 
increased exposure to the active metabolite (see section 5.1) is expected: 
- Hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2) 
- Renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2) 
- Concomitant administration of potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5) 
- Concomitant administration of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
….. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Following inhibition of CYP3A4 by co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily, Cmax and 
AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0 and 2.3-fold in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers and 2.1 and 2.5-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, respectively. Therefore, the maximum 
dose of fesoterodine should be restricted to 4 mg when used concomitantly with potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir (and all ritonavir boosted PI-regimens), saquinavir and telithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4)). 
 
 
 
 
 
…." 
Therefore, caution and clinical monitoring for fesoterodine adverse reactions and a potential dose 
reduction of fesoterodine is recommended for co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with 
rtv or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or D/C/F/TAF FDC with fesoterodine in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below). 
Solifenacin: 
Solifenacin is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4. Co-administration of solifenacin with medicinal 
products that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase the concentration of solifenacin. The Product Information of 
solifenacin indicates that the dose of solifenacin should be restricted to 5 mg when co-administrated 
with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor: 
SPC Vesicare (solifenacin):  
"4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
… 
- concomitant use of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, e.g. ketoconazole (see 4.2 and 4.5). 
…. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
…. 
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin:  
… 
Solifenacin is metabolised by CYP3A4. Simultaneous administration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day), a 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a two-fold increase of the AUC of solifenacin, while ketoconazole at 
a dose of 400 mg/day resulted in a three-fold increase of the AUC of solifenacin. Therefore, the 
maximum dose of Vesicare should be restricted to 5 mg, when used simultaneously with ketoconazole 
or therapeutic doses of other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, itraconazole) (see 
Section 4.2). 
……" 
Therefore, caution and clinical monitoring for solifenacin adverse reactions and a potential dose 
reduction of solifenacin is recommended for co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with rtv 
or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or D/C/F/TAF FDC with solifenacin in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below).

Assessor’s conclusion: 
Considering the mechanistic basis of this interaction with fesoterodine and solifenacin, the update of 
the SmPCs and PLs is acceptable. 
6.6.  Domperidone 
The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. Co-administration of domperidone 
with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase the systemic exposure to domperidone. 
Preclinical data show that inhibition of the CYP3A4 pathway can result in a 3-fold increase in free 
plasma concentrations of domperidone. The Product Information of domperidone contraindicates co-
administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: 
SPC Motilium (domperidone):  
" 4.4 Contraindications 
…. 
co-administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (regardless of their QT prolonging effects) (see section 
4.5) 
….". 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the 
concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of 
domperidone.  
Increased risk of occurrence of QT-interval prolongation, due to pharmacodynamic and/or 
pharmacokinetic interactions. 
Concomitant use of the following substances is contraindicated 
…. 
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (regardless of their QT prolonging effects), i.e.: 
• protease inhibitors 
• systemic azole antifungals 
• some macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin) 
(see section 4.3). 
 
 
 
 
 
……". 
Therefore, co-administration of boosted DRV (in combination with rtv or COBI), DRV/COBI FDC, or 
D/C/F/TAF FDC with domperidone is added as a contraindication in the respective updated Product 
Informations of DRV (Prezista), DRV/COBI FDC (Rezolsta), and D/C/F/TAF FDC (Symtuza) (see below). 
Prezista: 
SmPC 4.3 Contraindications 
…. 
Darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that 
are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the co 
administered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for 
which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events is 
contraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active 
substances include e.g.: 
…….

7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza are 
being  updated  (see  section  6  of  this  assessment  report).  The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  is  updated 
accordingly. 
Next to these updated the following general updates have been applied: 
Prezista:

pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being 
within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80 125% range (not determined as “ND”). 
In  the  table  below  the  specific  pharmacokinetic  enhancer  is  specified  when  recommendations  differ. 
When the recommendation is the same for PREZISTA when co administered with a low dose ritonavir 
or cobicistat, the term “boosted PREZISTA” is used. 
The  below  list  of  examples  of  drug  drug  interactions  is  not  comprehensive  and  therefore  the  label  of 
each  drug  that  is  co-administered  with  PREZISTA  should  be  consulted  for  information  related  to  the

These general updates are agreed. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to update of section 3 of the SmPC 
of Symtuza to correct the tablet dimensions (22 mm x 11 mm). Furthermore, the Package Leaflet and 
Labelling have been updated to reflect information on the in-use shelf-life in line with the approved 
Symtuza SmPC.  
Moreover, as per the revised Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’, the Package Leaflet of Prezista, 
Rezolsta and Symtuza have been updated to include information on the sodium excipient. 
Finally, in the Package Leaflet of Prezista and Rezolsta the Local Representative Addresses have been 
removed, in line with current EU guidelines and QRD. Local Representative names, telephone numbers 
and email addresses, where applicable, are still retained. 
The proposed changes are agreed.

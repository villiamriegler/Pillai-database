2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include treatment of adult and adolescent 
patients aged 12 years and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
(DTC), refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) and who have progressed during or after 
systemic therapy. 
Disease or condition 
Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) includes papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer 
(FTC) and a rare type, Hürthle cell thyroid cancer. 
According to ESMO (2019) DTC RAI-refractory diseasea is defined as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 10/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Absence of initial RAI uptake in metastases 
2. Absence of RAI uptake in metastases after treatment with RAI 
3. Presence of RAI uptake in some metastases, but absence in others 
4. RECIST progressionb despite RAI uptake in all metastases 
aOther criteria, but controversial: high FDG uptake, aggressive histology, persistence of disease after 
several RAI treatment courses. bAn increase of 20% in the sum of target lesions or the appearance of 
new lesions. 
Risk factors for differentiated thyroid cancer include a diet low in iodine and environmental radiation 
exposure (Pellegriti et al 2013). Inherited conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis and 
Cowden’s disease have also been linked to thyroid cancers due to certain germline mutations, as well 
as a family history of the disease (Guilmette and Nose 2018). In most cases, the cause of thyroid 
cancer is unknown. 
Epidemiology  
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasm with an annual estimate in the United States 
of more than 44,000 newly diagnosed cases and over 2000 deaths; the US annual death rate is 
approximately 0.6% (American Cancer Society 2021). Over 87,000 new cases and over 6,000 deaths 
were reported in Europe each year (Globocan 2020); worldwide, there were over 586,000 cases and 
43,000 deaths. Thyroid cancer is about 2.5 times more common in women than in men, and the 
incidence has almost tripled from the mid-1990s through 2014 (Roman et al 2017; Howlader et al 
2017).  
The most common type of thyroid cancer is differentiated thyroid cancer (> 90% of thyroid cancers). 
RAI refractoriness remains uncommon though, with an estimated incidence of 4-5 cases per million 
population (ESMO, 2019). 
Thyroid cancer can occur at any age, but most tumours are diagnosed between the third and sixth 
decade of life. Thyroid cancer is rare in childhood, accounting for 1.5-3.0% of carcinomas in children 
and adolescents. Nevertheless, it is the most common malignant neoplasms of the endocrine system in 
this age group (Enemoto et al, 2012). The cases of thyroid cancer in children are increasing year by 
year, by an annual incidence of 1.1% per year, a trend observed throughout the world, especially in 
areas affected by radioactivity (Stefan et al 2020). This increase is real, mostly because of the 
different environmental factors and is not attributed to intense imagistic screening (Dekker et al 2018; 
Russo 2017; Drozd 2015; Piciu 2012; Niedziela 2004). According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) Program data, between 1975 and 1995, the annual percent change (APC) of 
paediatric thyroid carcinoma was +0.8%/year; with an accelerated +4.6%/year APC from 1996 to 
2016 (Howlader 2019). Peak incidence is noted in children from 15-19 years of age (Rivkees et al 
2011; Howlader 2020). 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
MET and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling have been implicated in tumour neo-
angiogenesis, invasion, and dissemination, while dysregulation of MET and VEGF pathway components 
has been associated with poor prognosis in multiple tumour types (Carmeliet and Jain 2011, Trusolino 
et al 2010, Aftab and McDonald 2011). Increased levels of VEGF have been documented in recurrent 
Assessment report

thyroid cancer following surgery and in patients with metastatic disease (Zhou et al 2012, Klubo-
Gwiezdzinska et al 2007). The angiogenic activity observed in DTC led to the development of anti-
VEGF targeted therapies. Resistance to VEGF-targeted therapies may arise from the upregulation of 
alternative pro-angiogenic and pro-invasive signalling pathways, including the MET pathway (Shojaei 
et al 2010, Zhou et al 2016, Sennino et al 2012, Ciamporcero et al 2015). AXL is normally expressed 
at undetectable or very low levels in the thyroid (Axelrod et al 2014). AXL stimulation with its ligand 
GAS6 promoted survival of  
thyroid cancer cell lines in culture. Enforced expression or activation of AXL in normal rat thyroid cells 
significantly reduced RAI uptake. These data indicate that AXL expression levels could be used as 
predictor of RAI refractoriness and as a possible novel therapeutic target of RAI-refractory DTCs 
(Collina et al 2019).  
The MAP kinase pathway (MAPK) and the PI3K-AKT signalling pathways are the most common 
disrupted or upregulated pathways in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer. Activation of the MAPK 
pathway can result from BRAF and RAS mutations or RET and ALK rearrangements. RET is a proto-
oncogene which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is involved in tumour cell survival and 
proliferation (Drosten 2004). Mutations that activate RET kinase activity are frequently found in 
patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (Elisei et al 2008, Moura et al 2009). About 10-20% of 
sporadic PTCs have chromosomal translocations involving the RET proto-oncogene (RET-PTC fusions). 
The prevalence of RET-PTCs fusions is higher after radiation exposure (50-80%) and in young adults 
with PTC (Ciampi and Nikiforov 2007). The most prevalent RET rearrangements are RET/PTC1 (CCD6-
RET) representing approximately 60-70%, RET/PTC3 (NCOA4-RET) representing approximately 20-
30%, and RET/PTC2 (PRKAR1A-RET) representing 5% (Nikiforov 2011, Bongarzone et al 1998, Tallini 
et al 1998). These rearrangements lead to constitutive activation of RET kinase and downstream 
signalling of the MAPK pathway. Targeting the RET RTK activity represents a treatment opportunity in 
MTC and PTC (Pierotti et al 1996, Prescott and Zeiger 2015). The presence of BRAF mutation (V600E) 
is associated with a more aggressive form of cancer and is highly prevalent in RAI-refractory PTC (Xing 
et al 2005). The PI3K-AKT signalling pathway is activated in a smaller fraction of patients with PTC and 
FTC and leads to increased cell proliferation (Ringel et al 2001). 
Rearrangements involving the neurotrophic-tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene family (NTRK1, 
NTRK2, and NTRK3) are well-known drivers in a wide diversity of human cancers. NTRK fusions with 
various partner genes induce oncogenesis by producing chimeric oncoproteins with a constitutively 
activated kinase function, and lead to downstream stimulation of cellular proliferation via the 
RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. In the thyroid, NTRK-driven malignancies are rare (approx. 2%). In the 
special populations of paediatric papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and post-Chernobyl reactor 
accident PTC, NTRK fusions seemed slightly more common, reported in 2–26% and 3–15%, 
respectively (Chu et al, 2020). 
Given its predominance in the paediatric population, the most extensively studied paediatric thyroid 
cancer, in relation to molecular drivers, is PTC (little is known about the drivers of paediatric FTC at 
present). RET fusions are reported to be the most common observed alteration and appear to occur in 
approximately 25-30% of sporadic paediatric PTC (range 14-55%), a figure that further increases to 
nearly 45% (range: 14-87%) in patients exposed to radiation. Although less common than RET, other 
oncogenic fusions occur with increased frequency in sporadic paediatric PTC. Reported fusions include 
NTRK (1, 2 and 3), BRAF, and ALK. Although not comprehensively surveyed, these fusions have been 
identified in approximately 10% (range: 0-26%), 10% (range: 0-18%), and 5% (range: 0-21%) of 
paediatric PTC, respectively. BRAF point mutations are reported to be the second most common single 
oncogenic driver in sporadic paediatric PTC (25-30% of lesions, range: 0-63%). RAS mutations are

present in < 5% (range: 0-18) of sporadic PTC and are more frequent in benign thyroid nodules (15-
40%) (Poulson et al, 2019).  
Given the known oncogenic potential of the MET, AXL, and RET signalling pathways, targeting these 
oncoproteins in addition to VEGFRs may provide additional anticancer effects in DTC patients over 
more selective VEGFR inhibition strategies.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The majority of thyroid cancers are epithelial tumours that originate from thyroid follicular cells and 
can be classified on the basis of histology into differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) including papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and undifferentiated, anaplastic thyroid 
carcinoma. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is not a type of DTC but originates from the parafollicular C 
cells of the thyroid, (American Cancer Society 2019; Orphanet et al 2007; Ferlay 2019), see figure 
below.  
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is characterised by its papillary growth pattern of follicular cells with 
distinct nuclei. Follicular thyroid carcinomas are solitary encapsulated tumours with invasion of 
follicular cells into the tumour capsule and/or vascular system. Hürthle cell carcinoma (HTC), also 
named oxyphilic or oncocytic cell carcinoma originate in thyroid follicles from follicular cells (hence 
they were initially grouped with follicular thyroid tumours) and are characterized by the presence of 
Hürthle cells, which are eosinophilic oxyphilic cells with round to oval nuclei. Hürthle cell thyroid cancer 
is now defined as a follicular thyroid cell “derived” cancer and not a variant of follicular cancer itself. 
Figure 1. Classification of thyroid malignancies (Ancelle et al, 2012) 
A common risk-stratification of DTC is based on The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 
tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification. The TNM classification depends on the size of primary 
tumour, the number and localisation of metastatic lymph nodes and number of distant metastases. 
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) uses the combination of TNM Classification and an 
age of more than 55 years at diagnosis as risk factor. The differentiation of lymphatic invasion and 
angioinvasion is of high importance, because angioinvasion is associated with an intermediate risk of 
recurrence (Schmidbauer et al, 2017).

Thyroid cancer typically does not cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. In most cases, a 
small growth or lump (nodule), discovered by the patient, health care provider, or incidentally on an 
imaging study (e.g., a CT or MRI scan), is the first sign of thyroid cancer. Symptoms that may be 
associated with thyroid cancer include hoarseness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swollen lymph 
nodes especially in the neck, and pain in the throat or neck. 
At initial diagnosis of DTC, about 10% of patients have local tumour invasion into surrounding tissues 
and/or distant metastases. Common sites of distant metastases are lung and bone (involved in 49% 
and 25% of all cases, respectively, and in 15% of cases both are affected), but other soft tissues and 
the central nervous system (CNS) can also be involved. The main predictors of outcome for patients 
with distant metastases are age, location of metastases, and uptake of RAI. Patients who develop RAI 
refractory DTC have a poor prognosis with an estimated median survival time of 2.5-3.5 years 
(Busaidy and Cabanillas 2012; Durante et al 2006; Schlumberger et al 2014). Patients who were 
initially treated with I-131 and achieved negative imaging studies after RAI therapy showed longer 
survival, with a 10-year survival rate of 92%. However, when the patients became refractory to RAI, 
the 10-year survival rate dropped to 10–29% (Durante et al, 2006).

Surgical resection by either total thyroidectomy or unilateral lobectomy, with or without lymph node 
removal, is the main treatment for DTC. Patients with a high risk of disease recurrence, incompletely 
resected cancer, or distant metastases, may receive RAI. After thyroidectomy, lifelong thyroid 
hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is indicated. LT4 replacement therapy lowers thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) levels by a negative feedback through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and 
helps to prevent the growth of remaining thyroid cancer cells (Cooper et al 2009; National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] 2021).  
Recent treatment advancements for patients with RAI-refractory DTC include tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) targeting the VEGFR which inhibits tumour angiogenesis and causes hypoxia in malignant 
tissue. Two available multikinase inhibitors (MKIs), sorafenib and lenvatinib are approved for the 
treatment of unresectable, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, irrespective of the 
presence or absence of a RET mutation on the basis of significant improvement in PFS. According to 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and NCCN guidelines, lenvatinib or sorafenib is 
recommended as the standard first-line systemic treatment of RAI refractory DTC (NCCN [Thyroid 
Carcinoma] 2021; Thyroid cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and 
follow-up; Filetti et al 2019). In the NCCN guidelines it is stated that lenvatinib is preferred.  
Combined inhibition of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and MET represents a treatment opportunity which 
may enhance the efficacy over that achieved via inhibition of either pathway alone and overcome 
resistance (Sennino and McDonald 2012). 
According to ESMO guideline (2019) not all patients with RAI-refractory disease require systemic MKI 
therapy immediately. The treatment strategy should be based on multiple factors, including symptoms, 
tumour burden, ECOG PS, lesion characteristics (e.g., paratracheal location or other features likely to 
cause symptoms) and disease progression [defined using RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum 
of target lesions or the appearance of new lesion], see figure below. It is also stated that the optimal 
sequence of MKIs in RAI-refractory DTC cannot be determined based on currently available evidence.

patients (ESMO, 2019) 
Although initial therapy with VEGFR-targeting TKIs provides clinical benefits by improving PFS and 
ORR, the majority of DTC patients will acquire resistance to therapy and develop progressive disease 
(PD). For DTC patients who develop resistance to TKI therapy, options are very limited and more 
effective therapies are needed.  
Concerning thyroid cancer; in EU, selpercatinib, a selective RET inhibitor, received conditional approval 
in February 2021 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RET fusion-
positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with sorafenib and/or 
lenvatinib. Retsevmo is also indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib (Retsevmo EU Product Information).  
For the small number of thyroid cancers with changes in one of the NTRK genes, larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) 
and entrectinib (Rozlytrek) are approved in the EU (in 2019 and 2020, respectively) as monotherapies 
for treatment of adult and paediatric patients (for Rozlytrek restricted to 12 years of age and older) 
with solid tumours expressing a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, and who 
have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in 
severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options (for Rozlutrek the patient should 
also not have received a prior NTRK inhibitor).

In the paediatric population, response to sorafenib has been observed in progressive RAI refractory 
PTC, metastatic PTC not amenable to RAI, and when used as gap therapy when RAI could not be 
administered in a timely manner. Based on case reports, stable disease was reported in three 
paediatric patients with extensive bilateral metastatic pulmonary disease after treatment with 
lenvatinib (including in one patient previously treated with sorafenib). Studies evaluating lenvatinib in 
pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumours, including thyroid cancer, are ongoing 
(Paulson et al 2019). 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) known to play important roles 
in tumor cell proliferation and/or tumor neovascularization including the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), MET, 
AXL, and RET.  
Cabometyx (cabozantinib tablets) are currently approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted 
therapy (September 2016) and as first line treatment in adult patients with intermediate or poor risk 
(March 2018). Furthermore, the tablets are approved in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
who have previously been treated with sorafenib (September 2018). In February 2021 cabozantinib 
tablets were also approved for patients with advanced RCC, as a first-line treatment, in combination 
with nivolumab.  
Cabozantinib capsules under the brand name Cometriq were conditionally approved in the EU for the 
treatment of adults with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid 
carcinoma (MTC) (March 2014). 
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not receive Scientific Advice from CHMP for the applied indication.  
In Europe Exelixis (as the study Sponsor) received national scientific advice from the United Kingdom 
(MHRA) and Sweden (MPA) in 2018 concerning the design of and the regulatory strategy for the Phase 
3 Study XL184-311. Progression Free Survival (PFS) was considered an acceptable primary endpoint, 
and placebo was considered an appropriate comparator due to the lack of available treatments in this 
patient population (particularly after the receipt of prior lenvatinib or sorafenib). It was pointed out 
that including subjects who have received prior lenvatinib would be of particular interest. The company 
was advised to narrow the patient population and conduct the trial in patients who had received only 
one prior VEGFR-targeted therapy as this was considered optimal for demonstration of a response to 
cabozantinib and subsequent data interpretation. The statistical design and approach were agreed. 
However, it was underlined by MHRA that ORR would not be acceptable as primary endpoint for this 
study and MPA remarked that PFS2 would be of interest to explore.  
Cabozantinib studies in paediatric subjects:  
A Phase 1 single arm study (study 4 of the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP), (EMA Decision 
P/0331/2019) was conducted in 41 children and adolescents with refractory solid tumours. Thirty-nine 
(39) patients received cabozantinib tablets. The study determined the recommended Phase 2 starting 
dose of cabozantinib in this population as 40 mg/m2 (roughly equivalent to a 72 mg dose in adults with 
tablet). This study included 5 patients with thyroid cancer (however, this was medullary thyroid 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 16/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cancers and not differentiated thyroid cancers), with 2 partial responses. The safety profile was 
concluded to be not substantially different from the safety profile in adults. An ongoing Phase 2 study 
(Study 7 of the PIP) is evaluating the safety and activity of the 40 mg/m2 dose of cabozantinib tablets. 
This trial has included 109 patients, 7 of whom were < 9 years old at enrolment. Median age was 15.8 
years (5.6- 27.1). One patient with DTC (RET fusion positive papillary thyroid cancer) was included and 
had a partial response. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH confirms that the clinical trials included in this submission were performed in accordance with 
the principles of Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) and were conducted to meet the ethical requirement of European Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Furthermore, it is stated that the clinical trials carried out outside the European Union also meet the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Cabozantinib is approved in Europe for adults. No new nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, or 
toxicology studies have been conducted to support the extension of indication to include adults and 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and older, with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma (DTC), refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or 
after prior systemic therapy.  
Data from juvenile toxicity studies were submitted and assessed as part of the initial MAA for 
Cabometyx. The studies are in accordance with the agreed PIP for cabozantinib (EMEA-001143-PIP01-
11-M03).  An updated assessment of these data, focussing on safety aspect related to use in the 
adolescent population (12-18 years) is provided below.  
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
No additional nonclinical pharmacology studies were submitted to support the current application which 
was considered acceptable by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). 
2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional nonclinical pharmacokinetics studies were submitted to support the current procedure 
which was considered acceptable by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). 
2.2.3.  Toxicology  
Juvenile toxicity studies were submitted and assessed as part of the initial MAA for Cabometyx. The 
studies are in accordance with the agreed PIP for cabozantinib (EMEA-001143-PIP01-11-M03).  An 
updated assessment of these data, focussing on safety aspect related to use in the adolescent 
population (12-18 years) is provided below.  
Summary of general toxicity profile for cabometyx: 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 17/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats for up to 6 months duration target organs for toxicity were GI 
tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, reproductive tract tissues, endocrine tissues, liver and kidney, 
with NOAEL at 1 mg/kg/day in a 2-week study, and 0.3 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study. In addition, 
lesions in bone (thickened physis in femur without significant effects on bone growth, 2-week study) 
and teeth (broken teeth, 6-month study) were observed. The adverse effects seen at doses ≥ 5 
mg/kg/day were generally dose related, and reversible upon discontinuation. At the maximum dose of 
1 mg/kg/day during the 6-month study, mild and mostly reversible effects were seen on liver and 
kidney.  
In dogs, high doses (≥100 mg/kg/day) for 4-14 days caused hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, and 
dehydration. Additional targets for toxicity were GI-tract, lymphoid tissues, testes, bone (cessation of 
growth associated with atrophy of the primary spongiosa of the distal metaphysis), pancreas, 
gallbladder, eye and possibly CNS tissues, with NOAEL at 10 mg/kg/day. Lesions were reversible at 
100 mg/kg /day. In a 6-month toxicity study in dogs dosed up to 5 mg/kg/day no signs of toxicity 
were evident, but some effects occurred in reproductive tissues at ≥1 mg/kg/day (decreased testes 
weights with correlative microscopic findings of bilateral testicular hypospermatogenesis and bilateral 
epididymal oligospermia, and decreased ovary weights correlated with instances of ovaries without 
corpora lutea), with hypospermatogenensis still present following 28 days recovery. An extra chronic 
study with 20 mg/kg showed some reversible hematopoietic- and hepatotoxicity, and effects on skin. 
Primary treatment-related findings in reproductive tissues were decreased testes weights, bilateral 
testicular hypospermatogenesis and epididymal oligospermia, and decreased ovary weights that 
correlated with ovaries without corpora lutea.  Treatment-related findings were also present in 
mammary gland (reduced glandular tissue), uterus (fewer glands), and thymus (lymphoid depletion in 
males and females).  Following recovery, reduced testes weight and hypospermatogenesis were not 
reversed, while ovarian effects were considered reversible. The histological appearance of testes, 
epididymis, ovaries, mammary glands, and uterus was similar to animals that have not attained 
complete sexual maturity, which was not the case in the control animals.  
In both species, NOAELs were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.  
Cabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity 
assays. In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-related neoplastic findings consisted of an 
increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or in combination with malignant 
pheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in both sexes at 
exposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical relevance of the observed 
neoplastic lesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the 
rasH2 mouse model at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure.  
In a dose-finding 4-week study in rash-mice, dose-related decreases in testes and ovarian weights 
accompanied by correlative histopathologic findings (degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules 
and ovarian hypoplasia) was observed at all dose levels (≥5 mg/kg/day). Cabozantinib-related effects 
on male and female reproductive organs were also observed in a fertility study in rats at exposure 
levels at or below human exposure, leading to reduced fertility at ≥1 mg/kg/day for females and ≥2.5 
mg/kg/day for males. Weights of testes, epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicles decreased, and 
reductions occurred in sperm count and concentration from 2.5 mg/kg, with no fertile males were 
present at ≥2.5 mg/kg. A dose-related prolongation of diestrus showed at 2.5 mg/kg. Although the 
majority of females had confirmed matings, there were no pregnancies in either group. Female fertility 
and embryo/foetal viability were reduced at 1 mg/kg. The reversibility of the effects on male and 
female fertility is not known. 
Embryo/foetal viability and development were adversely affected at exposure levels well below human 
exposure

Toxicity studies in juvenile rats 
•  Dose range-finding repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in juvenile Wistar rats (XL184-
NC-031, non-GLP) 
Juvenile Wistar rats (9/sex/group) were administered XL184 at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg/day by gavage at 
post-natal days (PND) 12-35. Plasma samples for TK analysis were collected from satellite animals 
(5/sex/group). 
Toxicokinetic data are presented in Table 1. Due to suspected test article-related unscheduled deaths 
in the high-dose group from PND18, the dose level was lowered from 3 to 2 mg/kg/day on PND20. A 
reduction to 2 mg/kg/day for this group was not associated with any clinical findings indicative of 
toxicity. The 1 mg/kg/day dose level showed decreased body weights and teeth changes, and the 
NOAEL was determined to be at 0.3 mg/kg/day.  Based on test article-associated mortality observed at 
clinically-relevant exposures in PND 12-aged juvenile rats, a definitive juveniletoxicity study was 
conducted with dosing beginning at PND 21 (ie, age equivalent to > 2 year old human infant) in order 
to minimize risk of morbidity and unscheduled deaths. 
•  Repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in juvenile Wistar rats (XL184-NC-032, GLP) 
Juvenile Wistar rats (10/sex/group) were administered XL184 via oral gavage at 0 (vehicle control), 
0.3, 1 and 2 mg/kg/day from PND21 to 35 [cohort 1] or PND21 to 70 [cohort 2]. Additional groups of 
rats (10/sex/group) in Cohorts 1 and 2 received vehicle only or XL184 at 2 mg/kg/day and were then 
provided a 4-week recovery period. Blood samples were taken for toxicokinetic analysis on PND21, 35 
or 70 (9/sex/group). Evaluations included body weight and food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, sexual 
maturation, clinical chemistry, haematology, necropsy and histopathology. Toxicokinetic data are 
presented in Table 1.   
Test article related effects included a higher incidence of teeth abnormalities, slightly reduced body 
weight gain and food consumption at 2 mg/kg/day, primarily in the Cohort 2 animals. Clinical 
pathology findings at ≥1 mg/kg/day (both cohorts) included slightly higher red cell indices, 
occasionally higher leukocytes, modified calcium, enzyme activity (ALT and ALP), globulin 
concentration, marginally lower clotting times, albumin and albumin to globulin ratio. Increased 
numbers of peripheral T and B lymphocytes and NK cells were observed in Cohort 1 (PND36) at ≥1 
mg/kg/day. In Cohort 2 (PND71), cell counts were in general comparable with those observed in 
control groups, with the exception of a moderate increase in cytotoxic T cells and a marked increase in 
B lymphocytes in males, and a moderate increase in NK-cells in females, both at ≥1 mg/kg/day.  
Reduced organ weights (spleen, thymus, kidney, liver, heart, ovaries) were seen in Cohort 1 animals 
at ≥1 mg/kg/day. Reduced bone mineral density were seen in both cohorts at 2 mg/kg/day, and were 
only reversible in Cohort 1. Microscopically in Cohort 1, test article-related findings were present in the 
spleen (decreased haematopoiesis) of males dosed ≥1.0 mg/kg/day and females dosed at ≥0.3 
mg/kg/day, and in the ovary (pubescent) and uterus (immature, increased mucus cells) of females 
dosed at ≥1 mg/kg/day. The findings in spleen, ovary and uterus were reversible following 4 weeks 
recovery. Macroscopic findings present in occasional Cohort 2 animals dosed at 2 mg/kg/day included 
pale, chipped and/or broken teeth observed at the terminal sacrifice or at the end of the 4-week 
recovery period. Microscopically, test article-related findings in Cohort 2 females were present in 
spleen (increased haemopoiesis, ≥0.3 mg/kg/day), liver (increased pigment, ≥1 mg/kg/day), and 
mandibular lymph node (lymphoid hyperplasia, 2 mg/kg/day). Following recovery, the increased 
haematopoiesis was reduced, but the liver and mandibular lymph node findings was not reversed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 19/154 
 
 
 
 
 
As the microscopic changes present in spleen were considered non-adverse, NOAEL was determined to 
0.3 mg/kg/day for both cohorts. At NOAEL, XL184 AUC levels are estimated to be approximately 0.1-
fold human exposure at steady-state. 
•  Oral gavage study for effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats, including maternal 
function and juvenile arm (XL184-NC-040, GLP) 
In the juvenile arm of the study, juvenile SD rats (15/sex/group) were administered XL184 at 0 
(vehicle control), 1 and 2 mg/kg/day from PND12 to 35 [cohort 1] or PND12 to 70 [cohort 2]. Terminal 
sacrifice occurred either at the end of the dosing phase or following a 4-week non-treatment recovery 
period (approximately PND70 and PND98 for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively). Due to mortalities in both 
cohorts at 2 mg/kg/day, recovery was only assessed for the 1 mg/kg/day animals. Evaluations 
included clinical observations, body weight and food consumption, land mark and behavioural 
assessments (locomotor activity, pupillary reflex, Morris water maze, auditory startle), macroscopic 
observations at necropsy, terminal body and organ weights, bone density determinations, and 
microscopic evaluation of protocol-specified tissues.  A single plasma sample was taken for XL184 
concentration measurements from each juvenile rat prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the dosing 
phase.  
Cohort 1 
There was test article related mortalities (7 of 15 males and 6 of 15 females), and macroscopic and 
microscopic findings, including thickened wall of the duodenum, and alopecia of the skin, at 2 
mg/kg/day. XL184-related clinical findings at both dose levels included significantly decreased body 
weight, reduced food consumption, decreased mean terminal body weights, organ weight changes in 
the spleen, uterus, ovary, and testes (2 mg/kg/day). Microscopic findings considered test article-
related were present in lymphatic tissues, GI tract, bone marrow, skin and female reproductive tissues 
(delayed maturation) at ≥1 mg/kg/day, and in adrenal, bone (physeal hypertrophy), pancreas and 
testes (delayed maturation) at 2 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) was observed at 
doses ≥1 mg/kg/day. 
Cohort 2 
Adverse effects in juveniles administered XL184 from LD12 to LD70 paralleled those administered 
XL184 from LD12 to LD35 and resulted in test article-related mortalities (6 of 15 males and 2 of 15 
females) and macroscopic and microscopic findings at 2 mg/kg/day. Test article-related clinical 
findings, significant decreased body weight, reduced food consumption, reduced locomotor activity, 
and decreased BMD were observed at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day. No effects on organ weights were evident.  
Test article-related microscopic findings in addition to those seen in cohort 1 animals were present in 
liver (pigment in hepatocyte), testes (degeneration and/or atrophy of seminiferous tubules) and 
epididymis (reduced luminal sperm) at 2 mg/k/day, and in kidney (glomerulonephritis and chronic 
progressive nephropathy) at ≥ 1 mg/kg. As in cohort 1, there was a significant and dose-related 
decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) at ≥ 1 mg/kg.  
Taken together, there were adverse XL184-related effects at all doses (1 and 2 mg/kg/day), and a 
NOAEL could therefore not be determined. Findings on male reproductive organs were seen at 2 
mg/kg/day, with more severe findings in cohort 2 than cohort 1. Single plasma PK samples were taken 
at approximately 24 hours post final dose. At 1 mg/kg/day, plasma concentrations are estimated to be 
≤0.2-fold steady state in patients at therapeutic dosing.

2.2.5.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Toxicity 
Findings in adult animals of potential relevance for the adolescent patient population 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies for up to 6 months in rats and dogs, target organs of toxicity were GI 
tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal, teeth (rats), and reproductive tract tissues, 
without safety margins. Generally, the findings were reversible upon cessation of dosing.  
Thickened physis in femur was observed in a short-term study in rats (5 mg/kg/day for 2-weeks). In 
young dogs, cessation of bone growth associated with atrophy of the primary spongiosa of the distal 
metaphysis was observed at high doses in a short-term study in dogs (100 mg/kg/day for 5 days), 
likely related to anorexia, dehydration and/or stress. No effects on bone growth were, however, 
observed in 6-month studies in rats (up to 1 mg/kg/day) or dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day).  
In rats, effects on reproductive organs in males (decreased weights of testes, epididymis, prostate and 
seminal vesicles, decreased sperm count and concentration) and females (prolonged diestrus) were 
observed at exposure levels at or below human exposure, leading to reduced fertility at ≥1 mg/kg/day 
for females and ≥2.5 mg/kg/day for males. Potential reversibility of effects on fertility is unknown.  
In dogs, findings in male and female reproductive tissues comprises reduced organ weights (testes, 
epididymides, prostate, ovaries) and histopathological findings (testicular hypospermatogenesis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022

epididymal oligospermia, ovaries without corpora lutea, reduced glandular tissue in mammary gland 
and uterus). The findings were considered reversible in females, while the findings were only partially 
reversible in males.   
Studies in juvenile animals 
In study XL184-NC-032, animals have been dosed at up to 2 mg/kg/day from PND21-35 and 21-70. 
This is not in accordance with the agreed PIP where dosing from PND12 is outlined (EMEA-001143-
PIP01-11-M03), but since the intended patient population for DTC includes adolescents (aged 12 years 
and older), dosing from PND21 is considered acceptable. Findings included increased WBC parameters, 
decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without delayed vaginal 
opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and density, liver pigmentation and 
lymph node lymphoid hyperplasia. Except for bone and liver findings, other findings were reversible. 
No effect was seen in male reproductive organs in juvenile animals dosed from PND21-35/70.  
However, considering observed effects on male reproductive organs in adult rats at exposure levels 
higher than achieved in juvenile animals but below human exposure, effects on sexual development 
cannot be excluded. 
A juvenile arm with dosing from PND12 to PND35/70 was included as part of PPND study XL184-NC-
040. Here, findings included unscheduled deaths (2 mg/kg), decreased body weights, food 
consumption, organ weights (spleen, uterus, ovary, testes), and microscopic changes in multiple 
tissues (including bone (physeal hypertrophy, reduced mineral density), lymphoid tissues, GI tract, 
ovary, testes, uterus). Findings on male reproductive organs were seen at 2 mg/kg/day, being more 
severe following treatment up to PND70 than PND35.  While findings at 1 mg/kg/day were reversible, 
reversibility at 2 mg/kg was not assessed due to the unscheduled deaths.  
Generally, the results indicate that the younger rats (dosed from PND12, corresponding to paediatric 
age ≤2 years) are more sensitive to cabozantinib-related toxicity, including testicular toxicity, than 
rats dosed from PND21.  
Existing non-clinical data have not revealed significant effect on bone growth. However, reduced bone 
mineral density and content was observed at exposure levels well below human exposure in the two 
definitive juvenile toxicity studies. In animals dosed from PND21-70 the finding was not reversed 
within 4 weeks recovery. Thus, potential effects on bone development cannot be excluded.   
The intended patient population for the DTC-indication comprises adults and adolescents from 12 years 
of age. No new non-clinical studies have been provided to support the variation application, and no 
further studies are requested. Previously conducted studies in adult and juvenile animals indicate 
similar target organs for toxicity (GI tract, bone, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and 
reproductive tract tissues). No effect was seen in male reproductive organs in juvenile animals dosed 
from PND21-35/70. When dosed from PND12, however, findings on testes (degeneration and/or 
atrophy of seminiferous tubules) and epididymis (reduced luminal sperm) were seen at 2 mg/kg/day, 
being more severe following treatment up to PND70 than PND35.  
Histopathological findings of potential relevance for the intended patient population includes reduced 
bone mineralisation and findings in male and female reproductive organs, without safety margins. 
While recovery data indicate reversibility of effects in female reproductive organs, reversibility has not 
been demonstrated for cabozantinib-related effects om bone mineralisation and male reproductive 
organs.  In view of the severity of the disease to be treated, the potential risk of effects on bone 
mineralisation and delay in sexual maturation is considered acceptable from a non-clinical point of 
view.  
The non-clinical findings are adequately reflected in the proposed SmPC.

Environmental Risk Assessment   
Cabozantinib is not a PBT substance. The extension of indication to include patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic DTC refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In support of the current variation towards an extension of indication, the MAH submitted the 
bioanalytical report for Phase 3 study XL184-311 (A1805046.21.INT), the clinical pharmacokinetics 
analysis report Phase 3 study XL184-311 (XL184-311.PK.001), as well as the population PK Analysis 
Report (XL184 311.PopPK.001). Results from the clinical pharmacology studies that were included in 
the original cabozantinib marketing application are not discussed further in this AR.  
Bioanalysis 
Concentrations of cabozantinib in plasma were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography-
tandem mass (LC-MS/MS) method at Alliance Pharma (Malvern, PA, USA).

Pharmacokinetic analysis in Study XL184-311 
Cabozantinib plasma concentrations were measured in both the cabozantinib and placebo treatment 
arms in the pivotal Study XL184-311. PK samples were collected at predose, on Week 3 Day 1 
(W3D1), W5D1, and W9D1. All available PK data from enrolled subjects of the 19 August 2020 data 
cutoff date were included in the PK analysis. The eligible records from a total of 58 placebo subjects 
were all below the limit of quantification. 
A total of 115 subjects in the cabozantinib treatment arm had PK concentrations data, with 293  
eligible records  in the analysis dataset and were included in the PK analysis. Summary statistics for 
the observed cabozantinib concentrations collected at planned visit are presented below (Error!

a 
A concentration record had to meet specific requirements to be considered analysis eligible, which included the 
following: 1) The sample met stability requirements, 2) The PK concentration was not missing, and 3) The PK 
plasma sample was associated with a planned visit (ie, was not unscheduled or taken during screening). 
Mean plasma concentrations for cabozantinib decreased from W3D1 to W9D1. In case PK data were 
filtered to select analysis eligible records prior to any dose modification from the initial cohort-assigned 
cabozantinib dose, mean plasma concentrations at W3D1, W5D1 and W9D1 were 1460 ng/mL with 
CV% of 42.6% [n=94], 1340 ng/mL with CV% of 48.2% [n=66]), and 1190 ng/ml, with CV% of 
49.2% [n=28]. Although the arithmetic mean value at W9D1 still appeared lower than that at 
W3D1the difference was within their respective CV%. 
Population PK model 
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of cabozantinib was developed (Study XL184 
311.PopPK.001) using nonlinear mixed effects modelling methodology and implemented in the 
NONMEM software system. The PopPK model of cabozantinib was previously developed using 
cabozantinib concentration time data from 11 studies in healthy subjects and subjects with different 
types of malignancies (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], renal cell carcinoma [RCC], castration-
resistant prostate cancer [CRPC], medullary thyroid cancer [MTC]) to support the submission for 
cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in previously untreated (first line) advanced or metastatic 
RCC (XL184-CA2099ER.PopPK.001).

In the previous PopPK model, cabozantinib concentration-time data following the administration of 
both cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations were described by different absorption kinetics and 
bioavailability between capsule and tablet formulations. For the current submission, the previous 
cabozantinib PopPK model was updated using cabozantinib PK data from Study XL184-311 combined 
with PK data from previous cabozantinib studies with the tablet formulation only. In addition, PK data 
from capsule formulation were not included because they are only relevant to MTC and have different 
absorption kinetics and bioavailability relative to tablets. Thus, the analysis included 4746 quantifiable 
PK samples obtained from 1745 subjects from one Phase 1 and six Phase 3 clinical studies with the 
cabozantinib tablet formulation up to a 60 mg dose (Table 4 ).

a XL184-020 was the only study to have morning dosing and serial PK sampling; other studies had evening 
dosing and sparse PK sampling. 
b Includes subjects with at least one quantifiable concentration 
A 2-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination and two parallel absorptions process 
was used to describe the PK data. The absorption process was described by 1) a slow absorption phase 
which was described by four transit absorption compartments and 2) a delayed absorption process 
characterized by a lag time to describe the increase in cabozantinib exposure which was observed 
approximately 24 hours after the first dose in Phase 1 Study XL184-020.  
Base model ETA plots were examined to identify covariate-parameter relationships for inclusion in the 
full PK model. The covariates body weight on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume (Vc/F) 
and sex on CL/F were selected for inclusion into the full model. 
Goodness of fit plots for the final (full) model are provided in Figure 3. According to the Applicant, 
inspection of the figures suggested good agreement between geometric mean observed data and 
model predicted typical individual and individual values.  
The predictive performance of the final (full) model was evaluated using internal pcVPCs. Prediction-
corrected simulated and observed cabozantinib concentration data were used to compute the statistical 
intervals. According to the Applicant, the results of the internal pcVPCs (Figure 4) showed that the

model was able to adequately predict the 5th percentile, median, and 95th percentile cabozantinib 
concentration-time profiles for healthy subjects and subjects with various cancer types.

Parameter estimates for the full model are provided in Table 5. Separate residual error terms were 
estimated for healthy subjects and subjects with various cancer types and the residual error estimates 
were higher for subjects with cancer (36%) compared to healthy subjects (27%). Approximately 74% 
of the dose was absorbed by the transit absorption pathway and approximately 26% of the dose was 
absorbed prior to the 24 hour post dose PK sample with a lag time of approximately 19 hours. 
Table 5. Full model parameter estimates (Study XL184-311.PopPK.001) 
Typical PK parameters estimated from the final population PK model for a White male, DTC subject 
with a body weight of 70 kg were as follows: CL/F of 2.05 L/h, Vc/F of 98.8 L, Q/F of 15.5.0 L/h, and 
Vp/F of 178 L. The inter-subject variability was 43% for CL/F and 100% for Vc/F. 
Special populations 
In the popPK model, the impact of covariates was assessed on the steady state area under the 
concentration-time profile during one dosing interval (AUC(0-24,ss)), the steady state maximum 
concentrations (Cmax,ss) and the pre-dose plasma concentrations at steady state (Cmin,ss) for 
specified covariate values (i.e., test conditions) relative to a reference set of covariate values. 
Specifically, the reference condition was defined as a male subject with DTC and a body weight of 70 
kg receiving a 60 mg cabozantinib tablet once daily. The test condition differs from the reference by 
changing a specific covariate value. All other covariate values were identical to the reference.

•  Adolescents 
There were no adolescent subjects enrolled in Phase 3 Study XL184-311. Therefore, the expected 
adolescent cabozantinib exposures were extrapolated using the population PK model developed based 
on the adult data. Two approaches were utilized to estimate the anticipated range of body weight 
effect on cabozantinib exposures: 1) weight effect based on model estimates and 2) weight effect 
based on allometric scaling. A total of 1200 adolescents were simulated, with fifty subjects per half-
year of age from 12 to 17.5 years (total of 12 age categories) sampled from a normal distribution of 
body weight for each age and sex based on the CDC growth chart (Kuczmarski et al 2002). Steady-
state simulations were performed for the 1200 adolescent subjects using the parameter estimates 
from the final (full) PK model based on a daily dose of 40 or 60 mg. AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss 
exposure metrics were computed and mean values and SD were generated in addition to boxplots. The 
steady state exposure metrics were summarized by weight groups (i.e., < 35, > 35 to < 40, < 40, ≥ 
40 to < 50, ≥ 50 to < 70 kg) for the plots. 
Results of the predicted steady-state exposure in adults and adolescents or various weight receiving a 
60 mg or 40 mg dose, using model estimated for the effect of weight is shown in Figure 5 and Figure 
6.

Adolescent simulations using the final (full) model parameter estimates predicted similar AUC(0 24,ss) 
and Cminss but 37% higher Cmaxss in adolescent with body weight < 40 kg receiving 60 mg qd 
compared to adult subjects receiving the same dose. As expected, the predicted steady state AUC(0-
24ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss exposure for adolescent subjects receiving 40 mg qd tended to be on the 
low side of the range relative to adult subjects receiving 60 mg qd (i.e., the mean of each weight 
group was lower than for adults); however, Cmaxss for adolescent subjects receiving 40 mg qd and 
weighing < 40 kg had exposure within the 90% prediction interval of the adult subjects receiving 60 
mg qd.  
Simulations generated using allometric scaling predicted to have approximately 1.7-fold higher 
cabozantinib mean exposure (AUC(0-24,ss), Cmaxss and Cminss) in adolescent subjects with body 
weights < 40 kg and receiving 60 mg qd relative to adult subjects with DTC receiving the same daily 
dose. The predicted exposure for adolescent subjects < 40 kg receiving 40 mg qd was comparable 
(within 10% in mean exposures) to that of adult subjects with DTC receiving 60 mg qd. According to 
the Applicant, extrapolating adolescent exposure using allometric scaling is a conservative 
representation of the maximum anticipated body weight effect on cabozantinib exposure and could 
overestimate the effect of body weight on PK. 
•  Weight, gender 
In general, in Phase 3 Study XL184-311, the mean cabozantinib plasma concentration values were 
1.23-fold, 1.29-fold, and 1.13-fold higher in females than in males at W3D1, W5D1, and W9D1, 
respectively, though the spread of the standard deviations between males and females overlapped 
(Figure 9).

In the popPK analysis, for continuous covariates, such as body weight, 5th and 95th percentiles in the 
integrated analysis dataset (weight: 53 and 106 kg) were used to represent extreme covariate values. 
The covariate effects on AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss, are illustrated as forest plots in Figure 
10, respectively. Body weight had minimal impact (<14% change) cabozantinib exposure based on 
predicted AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss values. Only sex showed a slight impact on 
cabozantinib exposure with approximately 23-29% higher AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss values 
for females.

In the final popPK model, females had 21% lower CL/F than males, which resulted in > 20% higher 
exposure.  
The popPK estimated exponent of body weight effect on CL/F was 0.144, which resulted in minimal 
impact on predicted steady state cabozantinib exposure.

In the popPK analysis, although the Asian population had lower CL/F and V/F compared with other 
races based on a post-hoc analysis, the overall range of cabozantinib PK in Asian subjects was 
overlapping with White subjects (Figure 11). The DTC population, as investigated in Phase 3 Study 
XL184-311 had similar CL/F and V/F to other cancer types and healthy subjects, suggesting the 
exposure at steady state were comparable among patients with different tumour types.

•  Cancer type 
The observed cabozantinib PK exposures in subjects with DTC in study XL184-311 are consistent with 
those obtained in subjects with HCC and RCC. This is confirmed in the popPK study, where subjects 
with different cancer types have a slightly lower CL/F and Vc/F relative to healthy subjects. However, 
the range of cabozantinib PK in DTC was overlapping with subjects with other cancer types (Figure 
12).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No additional drug-drug interaction studies were conducted for this application. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) known to play important roles 
in tumor cell proliferation and/or tumor neovascularization including the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), MET, 
AXL, and RET.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies were conducted for this application. Exposure-response analyses 
were conducted and are presented below.  
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
•  Exposure-effect analysis 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis by cabozantinib exposure tertile was used to investigate the exposure-
response (ER) relationship between cabozantinib exposure and clinical efficacy and safety endpoints, 
and a log-rank test was used to compare the cabozantinib exposure subgroups for each endpoint in 
DTC subjects from Study XL184-311 (XL184-311.ER.001). The endpoints evaluated were PFS, 
cabozantinib dose modification, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), diarrhoea, hypertension, oral 
mucositis/stomatitis, fatigue/asthenia, and alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) elevation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 40/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For ALT/AST, the event was derived using clinical laboratory data. The analysis included cabozantinib-
treated subjects who received at least one dose of cabozantinib and had at least one measurable 
cabozantinib concentration available. Of those 125 cabozantinib-treated subjects, 115 subjects had at 
least one measurable PK concentration. Fourteen out of 115 subjects were excluded from popPK 
analysis due missed information but were included in the ER analysis and typical PK parameters were 
used. Cabozantinib exposure was defined as the overall average concentration calculated from time 0 
to the time of event or censoring (CAVG0T), which is a time-invariant exposure measure. For the 
cabozantinib dose modification endpoint, the average concentration over the first week of treatment 
(CAVG1W) was used to represent cabozantinib exposure to avoid possible correlation between CAVG0T 
and time of cabozantinib dose modification. 
Cabozantinib Exposure Response for efficacy in DTC 
For the assessment of PFS, a combined total of 29 subjects had events of disease progression or death 
out of 98 subjects with at least one quantifiable cabozantinib concentration, a valid baseline tumour 
assessment and at least one evaluable post-baseline tumour assessment.  
KM plots showed no clear relationship observed between the fraction of subjects with progressive 
disease or death and the different cabozantinib exposure tertiles, as shown in Figure 13. There was no 
statistically significant difference across the cabozantinib exposure tertiles as shown by log-rank test in 
Table 6.

Cabozantinib Exposure Response for safety in DTC 
A total of 92 subjects (with at least one quantifiable cabozantinib concentration) had a cabozantinib 
dose modification out of 114 subjects (80.7%). For the evaluation of dose modification, the 
cabozantinib exposure over the first week of treatment (CAVG1W) was used. The KM plot showed no 
clear relationship of the rate of dose modification and cabozantinib exposure tertiles. The log-rank 
tests also indicated that there was no statistically significant difference across the cabozantinib 
exposure tertiles.  
A total of 55 subjects had an event of PPE (Grade >1) out of 115 subjects. Although the KM plot 
showed a trend of an increasing frequency of PPE as cabozantinib exposure increase, a log-rank test 
indicated that there was no statistically significant difference across the cabozantinib exposure tertiles. 
A total of 24 subjects (blood pressure data) and 11 subjects (MedDRA) had an event of hypertension 
(Grade ≥ 3) out of 115 subjects with at least one quantifiable cabozantinib concentration. KM plots 
showed that a smaller fraction of subjects experienced hypertension (Grade >3, based on blood 
pressure data) in the lowest cabozantinib tertile compared to the highest exposure tertiles.  The log-
rank test for hypertension (vital sign data) indicated that there was a statistically significant 
relationship of cabozantinib exposure with the event rate. The results based on the MedDRA terms 
indicated that there was no relationship between hypertension and cabozantinib exposure; however, 
the number of events was too low for a meaningful ER analysis. 
Event rates were lower for fatigue/ asthenia (Grade ≥ 3), oral mucositis/ stomatitis (Grade ≥ 3), 
diarrhea (Grade ≥ 3), nausea/vomiting (Grade >3), and ALT/AST elevation (Grade >3). The KM plot 
for fatigue/asthenia (Grade ≥ 3) showed that a smaller fraction of subjects experienced fatigue/ 
asthenia in the lowest cabozantinib tertile compared to the highest exposure tertiles. The log-rank test 
indicated that there was a statistically significant relationship of cabozantinib exposure with the event 
rate. Similarly, the rate of oral mucositis/stomatitis (Grade ≥ 3) and diarrhea (Grade ≥ 3) tended to be 
higher in the higher cabozantinib exposure tertiles; however, no significant relationship with 
cabozantinib exposure was observed and based on a log-rank test there was no statistically significant 
difference in the exposure tertiles. KM plots and log-rank tests indicated that there were no statistically 
significant relationships of cabozantinib exposure with the event rates of nausea/vomiting (Grade >3) 
or ALT/ AST elevation (Grade >3).  
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods. Plasma samples from Phase 3 Study XL184-311 were analysed for cabozantinib 
using a sufficiently validated LC-MS/MS assay within the previously determined stability period. ISR 
was conducted and the outcome was compliant with requirements. Further, based on the provided 
summary of the method validation, QC coverage of the calibration range for the measurement of 
cabozantinib in human plasma is not aligned to EMA bioanalytical guidance. QCs were applied at 7.5% 
and 75% of the calibration curve, and a QC sample covering the middle 30-50% portion of the 
calibration range was missing. However, assay performance at the mid-range was sufficiently 
demonstrated based on the observed linearity of the calibration curve, as well as accuracy and 
precision at the 400 mg calibration curve standard and ISR of samples at concentrations around 50% 
of the calibration curve (0.5-1000 ng/ml).  
PopPK model. A popPK model was used to describe the cabozantinib PK in different populations and for 
covariate analysis. The popPK model included only PK data obtained with the cabozantinib tablet 
formulation. PK data from capsule formulation were not included because they are only relevant to

medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and have different absorption kinetics and bioavailability relative to 
tablets.  
The popPK model appears validated to a sufficient extent and provides an adequate description of the 
cabozantinib PK data following administration of the tablet formulation. The shown GOF plots are 
somewhat atypical, with only DV-PRED and DV-IPRED plots in the appendix of the popPK study report, 
but e.g., no PWRES nor IWRES vs time plots. Still, GOF plots indicated that the final model described 
the observed data adequately in the various treatment scenarios. Further, the visual predictive checks 
showed that the final model captured both the central tendency and the interindividual variability of 
cabozantinib PK plasma reasonably well. 
In the popPK model, body weight was included as covariate of both CL/F and Vc/F, as power models 
with estimated exponents. The estimated exponents were far off from the theoretical exponents of 
allometric scaling, probably due to the fact that larger body weights in the dataset are associated with 
overweight and obesity and hence not correlated with larger organ sizes.  
PK in Phase 3 Study. The observed cabozantinib PK exposures after 3, 5 and 9 weeks of OD dosing of 
subjects with DTC in Phase 3 study XL184-311 appeared to decrease slightly over time going from 
Week 3 to Week 9. This decrease is expectedly for a major part caused by dose reduction or 
interruptions over time.  
Adolescents. There were no adolescent subjects enrolled in Phase 3 Study XL184-311. The appropriate 
dosing regimen for adolescents with different body weights was investigated using popPK. For this 
purpose, two approaches were utilized to estimate the anticipated range of body weight effect on 
cabozantinib exposures: 1) weight effect based on model estimates and 2) weight effect based on 
allometric scaling. A total of 1200 adolescents were simulated, with fifty subjects per half-year of age 
from 12 to 17.5 years (total of 12 age categories). Steady-state simulations were performed for the 
1200 adolescent subjects using the parameter estimates from the final (full) PK model based on a daily 
dose of 40 or 60 mg. AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss exposure metrics were computed and mean 
values and SD were generated in addition to boxplots. The steady state exposure metrics were 
summarized by weight groups (i.e., < 35, > 35 to < 40, < 40, ≥ 40 to < 50, ≥ 50 to < 70 kg) for the 
plots. 
In general, based on the currently provided simulations, most of the interquartile weight ranges of 
predicted cabozantinib exposures for adolescent subjects receiving 60 mg qd dosing regimens fell 
within the simulated adult exposure associated with a daily dose of 60 mg. However, Cmax,ss for 
adolescent subjects weighing <40 kg was slightly higher than adult subjects (median Cmax,ss was 36% 
higher) with DTC receiving 60 mg qd. The predicted steady state AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss 
exposure for adolescent subjects receiving 40 mg qd tended to be on the low side of the range relative 
to adult subjects with DTC receiving 60 mg qd; the predicted median exposure in adolescents was 32, 
14, and 35% lower than adult for AUC(0-24,ss), Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss, respectively. However, Cmax,ss for 
adolescent subjects receiving 40 mg qd and weighing <40 kg had exposure within the 90% prediction 
interval of the adult subjects receiving 60 mg qd. 
The popPK model with estimated exponents fits the current dataset better than the model with fixed 
exponents; however, the model with the lowest OFV is not necessarily the best model to use for 
extrapolation. Allometric scaling with fixed exponents is considered the “best guess” when the model 
should be used to extrapolate exposure from adults to adolescents. Indeed, this is in line with the 
approach taken by the Applicant. However, with respect to these simulations with fixed allometric 
exponents, it appears that the model with fixed components initially used was not fitted to the data. 
Instead, only the magnitude of the covariate effect of body weight on CL/F and Vc/F was altered, while 
keeping all other parameter estimates the same. Therefore, in order to assess which model is best 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 43/154 
 
 
 
 
suited for extrapolation, t four different models were compared: Model 1 (current final model), with 
body weight effect on CL/F and Vc/F and the sec effect on CL/F estimated, Model 2: Model 1 without 
the effect of sex on CL/F, Model 3: Model 1 but the effect of body weight on CL/F and Vc/F fixed to 
theoretical exponents of allometric scaling and Model 4: Model 2 but the effect of body weight on CL/F 
and Vc/F fixed to theoretical exponents of allometric scaling.. 
These models were evaluated with a focus on how well they describe the PK of subjects in the lower 
body weight range (e.g., <60 kg). The pcVPCs stratified on study were complemented with pcVPCs 
stratified on body weight (e.g., <60 kg and ≥60 kg). Overall, the parameter estimation of the four 
models appears comparable to a reasonable extent, with CL/F within 10% difference. GOF and VPC 
plots for the new models 2-4 in the lowest weight range <60 kg do not indicate improved fit of the 
data as compared to the original Model 1. With the limited differences between the fit of the models, 
simulations with either model is indicated to yield comparable outcome as the original full model. 
Simulations with the full Model 1, predict that the proposed dose-advice for patients <40 kg and >40 
kg yields comparable Cmax,ss in adolescents to that predicted in adult patients, whereas the AUC0-24,ss 
and Cmin,ss in adolescent patients <40 kg are in the lower part of the range predicted in adult patients. 
The proposed dose advice based on modelling and simulation with the original full Model 1 is 
considered sufficiently robust, the dose advice for adolescent patients <40 kg based on this M&S 
approach is considered acceptable from a PK point of view. The currently proposed dose 
recommendation in adolescents is based on PK modelling and simulation. Further, the fact that no 
exposure-efficacy relationship for PFS was observed in adults with DTC, whereas a trend of increased 
AE rates for some safety endpoints was observed at higher cabozantinib concentrations, was taken into 
account. A PK modelling and simulation approach in principle may support a different cabozantinib 
starting dose for adolescents dependent on body weight, based on the aim to obtain comparable 
exposure. However, in this consideration it is assumed that no relevant differences exist between 
adolescents and adults with respect to pathophysiology and disease characteristics are present. With 
respect to PK, no such differences are expected. The situation with respect to expected efficacy and 
safety is discussed in further sections.  
In the SmPC section 5.2, factual information was provided on the predicted cabozantinib plasma 
concentrations in patients <40 kg at a 40 mg dose and in patients >40 kg at a 60 mg dose, as 
compared to plasma concentrations in adult patients at a 60 mg dose. 
Other special patient populations. Gender and weight. In general, in Phase 3 Study XL184-311, the 
mean cabozantinib plasma concentration values were 1.23-fold, 1.29-fold, and 1.13-fold higher in 
females than in males at W3D1, W5D1, and W9D1, respectively, though the spread of the standard 
deviations between males and females overlapped. The popPK estimated exponent of body weight 
effect on CL/F was 0.144, which resulted in minimal impact on predicted steady state cabozantinib 
exposure. Therefore, the effect of gender cannot completely be explained by a lower body weight of 
females. The observed difference in exposure between male and female is comparable to the 
difference observed for the other cabozantinib indications, and is considered to lack clinical relevance. 
Cancer type. The observed cabozantinib PK exposures in subjects with DTC in study XL184-311 are 
consistent with those subjects with HCC and RCC, and this observation was confirmed by population PK 
where there were no differences in cabozantinib PK among multiple cancer types. In addition, in 
adults, there were no clinically relevant effects of body weight, sex, and race on the PK of 
cabozantinib. 
Exposure-effect analyses. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis by cabozantinib exposure tertile was used to 
investigate the exposure-response (ER) relationship between cabozantinib exposure and clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 44/154 
 
 
 
 
efficacy and safety endpoints, and a log-rank test was used to compare the cabozantinib exposure 
subgroups for each endpoint in DTC subjects.  
No ER relationship between average cabozantinib concentration and PFS was observed.  
There was a trend of an increase in frequency of PPE (Grade ≥ 1) as cabozantinib exposure increased, 
although not statistically significant. Further, though exposure-safety relationships were inconclusive 
due to the small number of events for these safety endpoints, higher event rate was observed in 
higher cabozantinib exposure for these endpoints for Grade ≥ 3 fatigue/asthenia, Grade ≥ 3 oral 
mucositis/ stomatitis, and Grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea. According to the Applicant, adverse events were 
manageable by dose modifications. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The cabozantinib pharmacokinetics in support of the requested extension of indication to include 
patients with DTC has been investigated to a sufficient extent. Cabozantinib PK in DTC patients are 
comparable to that in other cancer patient populations investigated earlier. Within the present 
procedure, the MAH submitted modelling and simulation PK data for the age group ≥12- <18 years 
that indicated that the exposures of cabozantinib between adults and adolescents, using a weight-
based cut-off dosing approach, can be considered comparable. These data are included in the SmPC 
section 5.2.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose-response studies were conducted for this variation. The cabozantinib dose of 60 mg qd tablet 
has received approval for patients with advanced RCC and HCC. Cabozantinib 60 mg qd (as tablets) 
has also shown preliminary efficacy in an Investigator-sponsored study (ISS) in subjects with DTC. 
Thus, the initial cabozantinib dose for Phase 3 study XL184-311 was 60 mg qd (tablet formulation). 
In Phase 3 Study XL184-311, no ER relationship between PFS and average cabozantinib concentration 
was observed in DTC subjects supporting a dose of 60 mg QD with or without dose modification (i.e., 
40 mg or 20 mg).  
No adolescents with DTC were enrolled in Study XL184-311. The PopPK model based on adult data was 
used to extrapolate the adolescent cabozantinib exposure and provided a rationale for dose selection 
for the adolescent population with low body weight < 40 kg (see section ‘Adolescents’ under ‘Special 
patient population’ in the PK assessment part of this AR). Based on popPK simulations the chosen dose 
for an adolescent with body weight < 40 kg is 40 mg QD. The dose of 60 mg QD was chosen for an 
adolescent with body weight ≥ 40 kg as the predicted exposure for this body weight group is similar to 
an adult population.

Treatments 
Subjects received blinded study drug once daily, orally at bedtime. Study drug consisted of tablets 
containing 60 mg of cabozantinib or matched placebo. Cabozantinib/placebo was given in clinic on 
W1D1 and taken once daily at home thereafter until study treatment was discontinued. 
Two dose reductions, in decrements of 20 mg cabozantinib or matched placebo, were permitted to 
manage or prevent worsening of an AE or toxicity. Subjects could be re-escalated to the previous dose 
(but not higher than 60 mg/day) at the discretion of the Investigator and agreement of the Sponsor 
for AEs resolved or recovered to Grade 1 (or baseline value) and deemed tolerable and easily managed 
by optimized supportive treatment. Dose interruptions of study treatment for any reason were allowed 
for up to 8 weeks. Restarting treatment after interruptions longer than 8 weeks was permitted with 
approval of the Sponsor. All study treatment had to be discontinued if a once daily dose of 20 mg 
cabozantinib/matched placebo (minimum dose) was not tolerated. 
Antiemetics and antidiarrheal. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF or GM-CSF) were allowed 
if used per clinical guidelines (e.g., ASCO or ESMO guidelines). Bisphosphonates or denosumab. 
Transfusions and hormone replacement (including TSH-suppressive thyroid hormone therapy). 
Individualised anticoagulation therapy with low dose LMWH was allowed if clinically indicated for 
supportive treatment and the benefit outweighed the risk per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Erythropoietic-stimulating agents (e.g., epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa) were not to be used. Co-
administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors was to be avoided, per the current SmPC. Any 
systemic NPACT (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radionuclides, drugs or herbal products used 
specifically for the treatment of DTC) were prohibited. Therapeutic doses of oral anticoagulants (e.g., 
warfarin or other coumarin-related agents, direct thrombin or direct FXa inhibitors, antiplatelet agents 
such as clopidogrel, or chronic use of aspirin above low dose levels for cardioprotection per local 
applicable guidelines) were also not allowed. 
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared with placebo on 
progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
• 
PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BIRC  
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 48/154 
 
 
 
 
 
Defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of either Progression Disease (PD) per BIRC per 
RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause in the ITT population.  
•  ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BIRC 
Defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete 
response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1. by BIRC. The confirmation must 
have occurred at least 28 days after the response of CR or PR was observed. The primary analysis of 
ORR was limited to the first 100 randomised subjects (OITT population). 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Overall survival (OS) - defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. 
•  Duration of objective tumour response - defined as the time from the first documentation of 
objective response by BIRC or by the Investigator (subsequently confirmed at a visit ≥ 28 days 
later) to disease progression or death due to any cause. 
•  Safety and tolerability 
• 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of cabozantinib  
•  Relationship of baseline and post-baseline changes in serum thyroglobulin (Tg) 
•  Change in mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and global 
health as assessed by the EuroQol Health questionnaire instrument (EQ-5D-5L) 
Radiographic response and radiographic PD were determined using RECIST 1.1. For the purpose of 
determining the study endpoints of PFS, response rates, and duration of response (DOR), central 
review of radiographic images were conducted by a BIRC. The BIRC comprised board-certified 
radiologists who determined radiographic responses and progression following randomisation. Two 
primary readers were to assess independently each case in a dual read. The Primary Readers were 
responsible for all aspects of the read of a case, including target and non-target lesion selection and 
lesion contours and measurements. If the dual primary independent assessments were discordant a 
third radiologist were to serve as adjudicator to determine which of the reads was to be accepted. To 
minimize the potential introduction of bias, these individuals did not have any direct contact with the 
study site personnel or subjects. All radiographic tumour assessments (both scheduled and 
unscheduled) were sent to the BIRC, which also reviewed prior radiation history data for the purpose 
of selection of target lesions. To ensure image consistency, the same imaging modalities used at 
screening were used for subsequent tumour assessments after randomisation.  
Clinical deterioration or radiographic progression determined by the Investigator were not to be 
considered as events for the primary analysis. The recorded date of radiographic progression was the 
date of the tumour assessment visit at which progression was declared. If multiple scan dates were 
associated with a tumour assessment visit, the earliest assessment date within the set was chosen as 
the progression date. Only adequate tumour assessments (ATAs) were considered in the determination 
of radiographic progression and censoring dates. An ATA was defined as one that resulted in a time 
point assignment of response (CR or PR), stable disease (non-CR/non-PD), or progression. For PFS, 
ATA was based on soft tissue evaluation by CT/MRI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 49/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Radiographic tumour assessments included computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans and bone scans. CT/MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and neck (CAPN) 
were assessed at screening and every 8 weeks (± 7 days) after randomisation during the first 12 
months on study, then every 12 weeks (±14 days) thereafter. An MRI (or CT) of the brain was 
performed in all subjects at screening. After randomisation, scans of the brain were only required in 
subjects with known brain metastasis following the same post-baseline frequency as the imaging for 
CAPN. Whole body bone scans were acquired for all subjects at screening using a technetium-99 
(99Tc) bone seeking radiopharmaceutical; follow-up scans were performed every 24 weeks (± 14 
days) thereafter only for subjects who had documented bone metastases. 
Radiographic tumour assessments were acquired according to the protocol-defined schedule 
irrespective of whether study treatment was given, reduced, held, or discontinued including for 
subjects randomised to placebo who crossed over to receive cabozantinib. Tumour assessments 
continued until the later of Investigator-assessed radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1 that 
was confirmed by BIRC or the date of the decision to permanently discontinue study treatment. Bone 
scan findings alone were not used for the determination of progression or response per RECIST 1.1 
and required corroboration by CT or MRI.  
Sample size 
The study was designed to provide adequate power for both primary endpoints of ORR and PFS, 
employing a modified Bonferroni procedure (see section below on Interim analyses/Multiplicity). It was 
estimated that 100 subjects would be adequate to evaluate the co-primary endpoint of ORR alone, and 
300 subjects would be needed to evaluate the primary endpoint of PFS. To allow for an earlier 
evaluation of ORR, this study employed a “trial within a trial design”, where the primary analysis of 
ORR was limited to the first 100 subjects randomized to the study, defined as the OITT population. 
Analysis of ORR was expected to occur 6 months after the last subject was enrolled in this population. 
The study was to proceed to full enrolment of 300 subjects irrespective of the results of the ORR 
analysis in the OITT population.  
For ORR, it was calculated that 100 subjects would provide more than 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of no difference in ORR, assuming a true ORR of 2% in the placebo arm and 35% in the 
cabozantinib, a 2:1 allocation ratio, and a 2-sided alpha of 0.01, using a test of difference in 
proportions with a pooled variance estimate.  
For PFS, assuming exponential distribution, proportional hazards, and a 2:1 treatment allocation ratio 
(cabozantinib:placebo), it was calculated that 193 events would be required to provide 90% power to 
detect an HR of 0.61 using the log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level of 0.04. This corresponds 
to a 36% reduction in the risk of progression or death, or a 64% improvement in median PFS from 5.5 
months to 9.0 months. With a constant accrual rate of 20 subjects per month, a total of 300 subjects 
(200 in the cabozantinib arm, 100 in the placebo arm) was estimated to be needed to observe the 
required number of PFS events within the planned study duration (15 months accrual; approximately 
20 months to observe the required events).  
Under this design and with the application of the fallback method the minimum observed effects that 
would result in statistical significance for PFS tested at the 5% or 4% level are presented below:

Randomisation 
Subjects who met all study eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the following 
treatment arms: 
•  Cabozantinib arm: Oral cabozantinib (60 mg) once daily (qd) 
• 
Placebo arm: Oral cabozantinib-matched placebo qd 
Randomisation was stratified by: 
•  Receipt of prior lenvatinib (yes vs no) 
•  Age at informed consent (≤ 65 years vs > 65 years) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. For the crossover phase the Investigator could un-blind individual 
subjects with BIRC-confirmed radiographic PD via the IRT system.  
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were used for the analyses:  
• 
• 
• 
The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomised subjects regardless of 
whether any study treatment or the correct study treatment was received. The Overall 
Response Rate Intent-To-Treat (OITT) population was defined as the first 100 ITT subjects.   
The Safety population was to include all randomised subjects who received any amount of 
study treatment (either cabozantinib or cabozantinib-matched placebo). Analyses based on the 
Safety population was to be performed according to the actual treatment received. Subjects 
who received both treatments in error was to be summarised in the cabozantinib group.  
The Overall response rate Safety (O-Safety) population was to include the subjects included in 
the OITT population receiving any amount of study treatment (either cabozantinib or 
cabozantinib-matched placebo).  
Primary efficacy analyses 
The multiple primary efficacy endpoints for this study were PFS in the ITT population and ORR in the 
OITT population, both per BIRC. Formal hypothesis tests were planned for these endpoints and the 
primary objectives of the study was to be declared as met if at least one hypothesis was rejected at its 
respective alpha level. All other statistical evaluations of efficacy were to be considered exploratory. An 
interim analysis for PFS was planned at the time of the primary analysis of ORR.

ORR: The difference in proportions between treatment conditions in subjects in ORR (best overall 
response of confirmed complete or partial response) per RECIST 1.1 in the targeted patient population 
was defined by the primary estimand with the attributes summarised in Table 7.  
Table 7. Primary Estimand Attribute for ORR
The primary analysis of ORR was based on tumour assessments per BIRC and included all subjects in 
the OITT population. Hypothesis testing for ORR was to be performed using the Fisher’s exact test at 
the 2-sided α=0.01 level of significance. If the p-value for the test was less than the set alpha level, 
and the point estimate for ORR in the cabozantinib arm was higher than that in the placebo arm, the 
null hypothesis of no difference in ORR was to be rejected. If a sufficient number of responders were 
observed, analysis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method to adjust for stratification factors 
per IRT could also be conducted. Point estimates of ORR for each treatment arm, the difference in ORR 
between the two treatment arms, and associated confidence intervals, the odds ratio and its 
confidence intervals, were to be provided. The 2-sided 95% and 99% CIs for the point estimates, 
corresponding to the alpha level used for hypothesis testing, were to be calculated using exact 
methods. Likewisse the 2-sided 95% and 99% CIs for the difference in ORR between the two 
treatment arms and for the odds ratio were to be calculated by asymptotic methods.  
Sensitivity analyses for ORR planned to be performed included ORR based on tumour assessments per 
RECIST 1.1 per investigator, and concordance in ORR assessment between BIRC and investigator was 
to be summarised for the OITT population. In addition, ORR was also to be analysed descriptively for 
the ITT population at the time of final PFS analysis, and Waterfall plots displaying maximum percent 
tumour reduction since baseline in target lesions generated, for tumour assessment data on or before 
the progression/censoring date of the respective PFS analyses, per BIRC and per investigator.  
The disease stabilisation rate (DSR) defined as the sum of ORR and proportion of subjects with stable 
disease for at least 15 weeks was also to be summarised for the ITT population, and the odds ratio 
provided with corresponding 95% confidence interval. The ORR may also be summarised for crossover

subjects during their course of treatment with open-label cabozantinib for the ITT population upon 
observance of sufficient responses.  
PFS: For Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the primary efficacy analysis was to include all subjects in 
the ITT population. The recorded date of radiographic progression was the earliest assessment date 
associated with the tumour assessment visit at which progression was declared. Only adequate tumour 
assessments (ATAs) were to be considered in the determination of radiographic progression and 
censoring dates. An ATA was defined as one that resulted in a time point assignment of: response 
(complete or partial), stable disease/(non-CR, non-PD), or progression. For PFS, ATA was based on 
soft tissue evaluation by CT/MRI.  
The primary estimand for PFS was the difference in survival functions between treatment conditions in 
the duration of radiographic progression-free survival in the targeted population, with the attributes 
summarised in Table 8 .  
Table 8. Primary Estimand Attribute for PFS
Two alternative estimands for PFS were defined, arising from changes in strategy for handling some 
intercurrent events:  
Alternative estimand 1 changed the strategy for the intercurrent events; Surgical resection of target 
tumour lesions, Receipt of systemic non- protocol anti-cancer medications, Receipt of local non-
protocol anti-cancer medications for disease under study, and Receipt of local radiation to soft tissue 
for disease under study, to “composite” where they count as events instead of leading to censoring, 
resulting in an endpoint that comprises radiographic and clinical progression (as well as death).  
Alternative estimand 2 changes the strategy to “composite” only for systemic non- protocol anti-cancer 
medications, yielding an endpoint that comprises radiographic progression, death, or initiation of 
systemic NPACT.  
The primary analysis of PFS (designated PFS-EP-1) was event-based and was to be conducted after at 
least 193 events had been observed in the ITT population (progression per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC or 
deaths), with actual critical values will depend upon the true number of events observed at each 
analysis, at either a 2-sided α=0.04 or 0.05 level of significance as per the testing strategy. The 
hypothesis testing between the two treatment arms was to be performed using a log-rank test with 
stratification factors as in the randomisation; Receipt of prior lenvatinib (yes or no), and Age at 
informed consent (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years), as recorded in the IRT. If the p-value for the stratified 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 53/154 
 
 
 
 
 
log-rank test was less than the critical value and the hazard ratio was less than one, the null 
hypothesis was to be rejected and PFS inferred to be superior in the cabozantinib arm compared to the 
placebo arm. The median duration of PFS and the associated 96% or 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
each treatment arm was to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The stratified hazard ratio 
(HR) and its 96% or 95% CI was to be estimated using a Cox proportional-hazard model with 
treatment group as the independent variable and stratified by the same randomisation stratification 
factors as were used for the log-rank test. The above analysis will also be provided for the OITT 
population.  
PFS sensitivity analyses: Sensitivity analyses were planned to evaluate the impact of different 
assumptions or conditions that potentially influence the estimate of the primary estimand (PFS-EP-1).  
PFS-EP-2 evaluated the influence of potentially inconsistent tumour assessment intervals between 
arms, by assigning the date of the scheduled visit as the event date, rather than the date of recorded 
progression.  
PFS-EP-3 evaluated the influence of the assessor of radiographic progression, and was based on 
RECIST 1.1 evaluations by the investigator rather than the BIRC.  
PFS-EP-4 evaluated the influence of the missing tumour assessments, by classifying subjects who 
experience ≥ 2 consecutive missing scheduled ATA immediately prior to documented radiographic 
progression as having an event at the date of the last ATA prior to the missing visits, rather than being 
censored.  
Three supplemental analyses directed at the two alternative estimands for PFS were to be carried out; 
the primary analysis of alternative estimand 1, and 2, respectively (PFS-EA1-1, PFS-EA2-1), and a 
sensitivity analysis of alternative estimand 2, similar to PFS-EP-4 defined above (PFS-EA2-2).  
Four additional “differential” sensitivity analyses based on the primary analysis (PFS- EP-1) were to be 
conducted to evaluate the impact of potentially informative censoring, with selected censored subjects 
re-classified as events, differentially by treatment arm. In all of these (PFS-EP-11, PFS-EP-12, PFS-EP-
13, PFS-EP-14), rPD by Investigator but not BIRC, was assigned as an event at date of first rPD in the 
experimental arm, and in one also in the control arm (PFS-EP-13). Discontinuation of radiographic 
assessment for reason other than rPD and without systemic non-protocol anti-cancer therapy, was as 
an event at last ATA (PFS-EP-11, PFS-EP-12, PFS-EP-13, PFS-EP-14). Systemic non-protocol anti-
cancer therapy (sNPACT) prior to rPD (INV or BIRC), was assigned as an event at first sNPACT in 
Experimental and Control arm (PFS-EP-12), or only control arm (PFS-EP-14).  
All sensitivity and supplemental analyses were to include all subjects in the ITT population. Tabulated 
summaries of survival times, hazard ratios, and log rank test statistics as well as graphs of survival 
functions was to be presented. 
The concordance in assessment of radiographic progression and the date between BIRC and 
investigator was to be summarised for the ITT population.  
Secondary efficacy analyses  
Overall survival: OS was defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. Subjects 
who were lost to follow-up, withdrew consent from survival follow-up or were alive on or after the data 
cutoff were to be right censored. The analysis of OS was to include all subjects in the OITT and ITT 
populations and summaries (median and 95% CI for median, stratified and unstratified HRs and their 
95% CI) and graphs as described for primary analysis of PFS were to be generated. Log-rank p- values 
were to be calculated for descriptive purposes (formal inferences not drawn). If the null hypothesis for 
ORR was rejected an administrative interim analysis of OS was to be performed with the primary 
purpose of evaluating the potential for detriment to survival with cabozantinib treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 54/154 
 
 
 
 
A sensitivity analysis for OS in the ITT population was to be conducted, censoring for receipt of any 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. An exploratory OS analysis for the ITT population was to be 
conducted adjusting for crossover of placebo subjects to cabozantinib as a time-dependent covariate. 
Additional exploratory OS analysis may also be conducted to adjust for the crossover to cabozantinib 
utilizing the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) or rank preserving structural failure time 
model (RPSFTM), if feasible.  
Duration of objective response was to be analysed similar to PFS for OITT and ITT populations.  
Time to objective response was defined as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of 
objective response that is subsequently confirmed at a visit that is ≥ 28 days later to disease 
progression or death due to any cause, was to be analyses using arithmetic (not Kaplan-Meier) 
methods.  
The time to second disease progression or death (PFS2), defined as the time from randomisation to 
the date of the earliest of the following events: start of second subsequent non-radiation anti-cancer 
therapy, second objective disease progression, or death. For placebo subjects who have crossed over 
to receive cabozantinib, cabozantinib was to be considered as the first subsequent therapy. For 
subjects randomised to cabozantinib who continued on study treatment after their first disease 
progression, the start date of their first subsequent therapy was to be considered to be a potential 
event date. Subjects alive and for whom a PFS2 event has not been observed was to be censored at 
the last time known to be alive. The summaries (median and 95% CI for median, stratified and 
unstratified HRs and their 95% CI) and graphs as described for primary analysis of PFS were to be 
generated for PFS2. Log-rank p-values were to be calculated and presented for descriptive purposes 
(formal inferences not to be drawn).  
Baseline and changes from baseline for the biomarker thyroglobulin was to be summarised by 
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and median) by treatment group using all available 
data from protocol-defined time-points (baseline, W5D1, and W9D1), and a waterfall plot of best 
percentage decrease from baseline presented for each treatment group (in OITT and ITT populations).  
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL), assessed by the EuroQol Health questionnaire instrument (EQ-
5D-5L) was to be summarised at each time point for each of the 6 questions by, within each treatment 
arm; descriptive statistics, Rate of completion, Mean change from baseline (95% CI=, p-value from 
one-sample t-test, Effect size, Shift in the severity scale since baseline, and between treatment arms 
by difference in; the effect sizes, mean change from baseline (t-test). Plots for mean±standard error 
and the corresponding mean for change from baseline over time, Percentage of subjects in Level 1 (no 
problem) vs. Levels 2-5 (any problems) over time, Percentage of subjects with any problems (Level 2-
5) were to be presented. Repeated-measures mixed-effects models were to be used to explore 
treatment differences over time for the blinded phase of the study only. These analyses were to 
include the outcome variable of QOL score change from baseline. The predictors (fixed effects) were to 
be the baseline scores, treatment arms, visit, and randomisation strata. The individual subject nested 
within the planned treatment arm was to be the random effect. All available data were to be included 
for the analysis, and the estimated least squares means for the two treatment arms and their 
difference, the p-values comparing the 2 treatment arms, and the effect size presented. No 
adjustments were to be made for multiple comparisons. An effect size of differences in the ≥ 0.3 range 
was to be considered potentially clinically meaningful. All summaries were to be provided for the OITT 
and ITT populations.  
Subgroup analyses  
Subgroups based on baseline characteristics and stratification factors were to be explored for the 
primary efficacy endpoints and Overall Survival.

Interim analyses / Multiplicity 
The multiplicity issue resulting from analysis of two primary endpoints (PFS and ORR) was addressed 
by applying a modified Bonferroni procedure (dividing the alpha between the two primary endpoints).  
ORR was tested at the 2-sided 1% alpha significance level and PFS tested at the 2-sided 4% alpha 
significance level. Additionally, the fallback method for alpha allocation was to be implemented as 
follows:  
• 
If the null hypothesis was rejected for ORR, its alpha allocation of 1% would be passed to PFS 
which would then be tested at the 5% level.  
• 
If the null hypothesis was not rejected for ORR, then PFS was to be tested at its original alpha 
allocation of 4%.  
An interim analysis was planned for the second primary endpoint of PFS at the time of the primary 
ORR analysis when approximately 43% of the planned total PFS events were expected to have been 
observed. Inflation of Type 1 error arising from repeated analyses of PFS was to be controlled by a 
Lan-DeMets O’Brien Fleming alpha spending function, using the actual information fraction at the 
interim analysis (see table under Sample size section). Rejection of the null hypothesis for PFS at the 
interim analysis was not expected; it was intended to allow evaluation of PFS at the time of the 
primary analysis of ORR. The interim analysis was conducted under supervision of the IDMC, which 
operated independently from the sponsor and the clinical investigators.

Subjects’ trial participation consisted of the following periods: 
Pre-treatment period: Potential subjects were screened to determine if they met the required eligibility 
criteria. Qualifying screening assessments were performed within 28 days before randomization unless 
otherwise specified. 
Treatment period: Subjects who met all study eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio 
to the following treatment arms: 
•  Cabozantinib arm: Oral cabozantinib (60 mg) once daily (qd) 
• 
Placebo arm: Oral cabozantinib-matched placebo qd

Crossover phase: Subjects randomised to the placebo arm were permitted to crossover to receive 
cabozantinib upon experiencing radiographic disease progression (PD) as determined by the 
Investigator per RECIST 1.1 and confirmed by the BIRC. A real-time, dual reader adjudicated BIRC 
review of radiographic images per RECIST 1.1 was employed to document objective radiographic 
progression contemporaneously with subject study participation. At the time of Investigator-
determined radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, the Investigator could request from the 
Sponsor’s medical monitor (or designee) confirmation of BIRC-determined radiographic PD and un-
blind those subjects with BIRC-determined radiographic PD via the Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) system.  
Subjects randomised to placebo who crossed over to receive cabozantinib had baseline re-established 
and restarted the tumour assessment schedule. The new baseline was to be based upon the most 
recent set of scans performed prior to un-blinding for crossover. If these scans were performed > 8 
weeks prior to the first crossover dose, new scans were required to establish the crossover baseline. 
Un-blinded subjects randomised to placebo had the opportunity, if eligible, to enter the crossover 
phase to receive cabozantinib and undergo study assessments. These subjects were to continue on 
study treatment if the Investigator believed the subject was still deriving clinical benefit. Subjects who 
were ineligible or opted not to crossover to receive cabozantinib had study treatment discontinued and 
proceeded with post-treatment assessments.  
In the crossover phase, safety assessments and radiographic tumour assessments continued per 
protocol, although scans were not submitted to BIRC. PK, biomarker, and HRQOL assessments were 
discontinued. 
End of study treatment: Subjects received blinded study treatment or un-blinded treatment with 
cabozantinib as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator 
or until there was unacceptable toxicity or the need for systemic NPACT. Treatment could continue 
after radiographic PD per RECIST 1.1 in the absence of systemic NPACT as long as the Investigator 
believed that the subject was still receiving clinical benefit from study treatment and that the potential 
benefit of continuing study treatment outweighed potential risk. 
Post-treatment period: A post-treatment follow-up visit occurred 30 (+14) days after the date of the 
decision to discontinue study treatment. Subjects were contacted every 12 weeks (± 7 days) after the 
post-treatment follow-up visits to assess survival status and document receipt of NPACT and 
subsequent progression status. This continued until the subject expired or the Sponsor decided to 
discontinue collection of these data in the study.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) monitored unblinded results of the study on a 
regular basis. The objectives of the IDMC were to evaluate interim data to protect subject welfare and 
to provide recommendations regarding study conduct to the Sponsor. Formal futility analyses were not 
planned. The committee operated independently from the Sponsor and the clinical Investigators. To 
minimize the potential introduction of bias, IDMC members did not have any direct contact with the 
study site personnel or subjects. The IDMC members were selected for their expertise in oncology 
and/or biostatistics. 
Reasons for screen failures 
A total of 40 subjects failed screening as of CCO1 (i.e., the data cut off at 19 August 2020). There was 
a total of 59 reasons for screen failure (data not shown). An additional 25 subjects were in screening 
with eligibility still pending at the data cut-off date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 58/154 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common reasons for screen failure were 7 subjects not fulfilling the exclusion criterion 
“Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy 
and/or surgery and stable for at least 4 weeks before randomization”, 6 subjects not fulfilling the 
inclusion criterion of “Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of DTC including FTC and its 
variants” and 5 subjects each not fulfilling the exclusion criterion “Other clinically significant disorders 
as specified in the protocol” and the inclusion criterion “UPCR ≤ 1 mg/mg (≤ 113.2 mg/mmol)”. 
Recruitment 
Study period: 27 February 2019 (first subject randomised) – 19 August 2020 (data cut-off date; 
minimum of 6 months’ follow-up for the first 100 subjects). 
A total of 161 unique sites headed by 174 principal investigators in 25 countries were activated for this 
study: of these sites, 89 enrolled 187 subjects for this study as of the 19 August 2020 data cut-off 
date.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were no global amendments to the original protocol (dated 30 April 2018). 
The original protocol had four country-specific amendments and one country-specific addendum: two 
amendments for Germany (amendment 0.1.1 dated 01 May 2019 and amendment 0.1.1.1.1 dated 03 
August 2020, respectively), one amendment for Canada (amendment 0.2 dated 28 February 2019), 
one amendment for France (appendix 0.3 dated 22 April 2019) and one addendum for UK (dated 25 
March 2019). These amendments mainly concerned revisions of definitions, addition of language in 
order to make clarifications/specifications/modifications. This pertained for instance to some of the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., specification of contraception recommendations, revision of the 
definition of hypertension, lowering of the exclusionary QTcF threshold, correction of the timeframe for 
ECG testing) For Germany further consolidated guidance was also given in an appendix for 
investigators in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The addendum for UK was prepared to clarify the 
definition of the end of the trial.  
Some special accommodations were also performed in regards to the global COVID-19 pandemic. This 
included e.g., that safety assessment visits, including laboratory test visits, were allowed to be 
performed remotely as appropriate, tumour assessments were allowed to be performed at a local 
radiology facility on an individual basis depending on local circumstances. Safety and imaging results 
obtained remotely were documented, as for data obtained on site. Tumour images obtained at local 
radiology facilities were sent to BIRC. An interviewer-administered validated phone version of quality 
of life questionnaires was allowed to be used as an alternative as appropriate. Use of the phone format 
questionnaire was to be documented as a COVID-19 related protocol deviation in the source document. 
Telehealth visits were performed in 21 subjects (11%) due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in 
a missed or incomplete assessment since procedures such as vitals, physical exam and ECG could not 
be performed.

A total of 7 subjects (5.6%) in the cabozantinib arm and 2 subjects (3.2%) in the placebo arm failed to 
meet at least one eligibility criterion. A total of 5 subjects (4.0%) in the cabozantinib arm vs. 1 subject 
(1.6%) in the placebo arm failed at least one inclusion criteria. The most common inclusion criteria 
deviation was not meeting the required screening laboratory values of TSH within the required time 
period while receiving thyroxine suppression therapy (3 subjects [2.4%] in the cabozantinib arm vs. 
none in the placebo arm). A total of 2 subjects (1.6%) in the cabozantinib arm and 1 subject (1.6%) in 
the placebo arm failed at least one exclusion criterion. All reported exclusion criteria deviations 
occurred in one subject each.

Three important deviations categorized as randomization irregularities were reported and were related 
to accidental un-blinding at the site. In this study, Investigators were able to submit crossover 
requests or complete immediate emergency safety un-blinding via the IxRS.

Baseline data 
The data for baseline demographic characteristics, baseline disease history, prior radioiodine therapy 
for DTC, prior non-radiation anticancer therapy for DTC and prior radiation therapy were generally 
similar between subjects randomised as of CCO1 (ITT population where the primary endpoint was met) 
and CCO2 (Full ITT population). The majority of the differences between the two data sets for all the 
various baseline characteristics were in the range of 1-4%; consequently, only data for CCO1 are 
shown in the Assessment Report.

The most common reason subjects were refractory to RAI therapy was disease progression despite RAI 
avidity. A total of 5 subjects in the cabozantinib arm were ineligible for RAI therapy for DTC (1 subject 
received one dose of RAI and was then deemed ineligible); reasons included iodine allergy and intact 
thyroid gland. All subjects who were refractory to prior RAI received prior RAI.  However, for 8 
subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 1 subject in the placebo arm, the prior RAI treatment information 
was entered after the data cut-off date; therefore, these subjects are not summarised as having 
received prior RAI in the table above.

In order to be eligible for this study, subjects were required to have a TSH value below the normal 
range. The majority of subjects (approximately 84%) had a baseline TSH value of ≤ 0.1 mIU/L. Median 
baseline thyroglobulin values were 2027.83 ng/mL in the cabozantinib arm and 1746.30 ng/mL in the 
placebo arm (ITT population). 
Concomitant medications 
Concomitant medications that had a ≥ 10% higher incidence in the cabozantinib only arm compared 
with the placebo arm by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were loperamide, 
amlodipine, urea, calcium, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and clobetasol (safety population). In the 
cabozantinib arm 9/125 (7.2%) vs. 10/62 (16%) in the placebo arm used dexamethasone.  
Treatment compliance 
A total of 12 subjects (9.6%) in the cabozantinib only arm and 3 subjects (4.8%) in the placebo arm 
had their dose interrupted due to subject non-compliance for reasons other than an AE. 
Crossover subjects: baseline characteristics prior to crossover (ITT population) 
For the 19 subjects in the ITT population who were randomised to placebo then crossed over to receive 
cabozantinib upon BIRC-confirmed radiographic progression, selected demographic and baseline 
characteristics were re-established immediately prior to crossover. The median age of subjects in the 
placebo crossover arm was 66 years, consistent with that in the cabozantinib arm (ITT population). A 
Assessment report

higher proportion of subjects in the placebo crossover arm had a baseline ECOG PS of 1 immediately 
prior to crossover compared with the cabozantinib arm (74% vs 53%, respectively). The median time 
to progression while on placebo per BIRC was 1.77 months (range: 0.6 -7.1 months) in the placebo 
crossover arm. Number of target lesion locations prior to crossover was 1 for 32% of the patients and 
2 for 42% of the patients.

As of the data cut-off date, a total of 21 subjects randomised to placebo were approved for crossover; 
however, two of these subjects did not begin open-label cabozantinib until after the data cut-off date 
and were not included in summaries of subjects who crossed over. Of the 19 subjects who crossed 
over, 5 discontinued cabozantinib after crossing over. The most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation was clinical deterioration (3 subjects). Two subjects who were randomised to 
cabozantinib transitioned to open-label cabozantinib (1 subject was recorded as discontinuing blinded 
study treatment due to PD). One of these subjects discontinued open-label study treatment after the 
transition due to clinical deterioration. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy analyses of cabozantinib were based on the pre-specified primary endpoint analysis of 
ORR in the first 100 randomized subjects and an interim primary endpoint analysis of PFS from the 
187 subjects (125 cabozantinib, 62 placebo) randomized as of CCO1 on 19 August 2020. CCO1 was set 
6 months after the 100th subject randomised. After the 19 August 2020 cut-off date, subjects 
continued to enrol in the study and receive blinded study treatment.

A sensitivity analysis of ORR per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigator was conducted in the 
OITT population using the data cut-off date as of CCO1. The ORR per Investigator for the OITT 
population was 21% (95% CI: 11.9, 32.6) in the cabozantinib arm and 0% (95% CI: 0.0, 10.6) in the 
placebo arm (unstratified p-value of 0.0040). Results were similar to those determined by BIRC.

However, the proportion of patients with SD was equal in this population (58% in each arm). For the 
OITT population, the median (range) time from randomization to the first objective response was 1.9 
(1.38, 7.29) months per Investigator in the cabozantinib arm. 
Among subjects in the OITT population with at least one baseline and at least one post-baseline target 
lesion assessment, 51/61 (84%) in the cabozantinib arm and 8/32 (25%) in the placebo arm had a 
post-baseline reduction in the SoD.

The table below provides a summary of concordance and discordance between the BIRC- and 
Investigator-determined assessments of tumour response status in subjects having at least one 
adequate post-baseline tumour assessment by both BIRC and Investigator. Overall, the BIRC and

Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival 
The analysis of the OS endpoint was performed using the ITT population. As of CCO1, a total of 31 
deaths (17 cabozantinib, 14 placebo) were reported by this date. A total of 2 subjects (in the 
cabozantinib arm) withdrew full consent including for survival follow-up. All subjects were censored at 
their last known alive date. Subjects who were known to have died after the data cut-off date of 19 
August 2020 were censored on that date. The median time of follow-up through 19 August 2020 was 
6.24 months in the ITT population. Of note, the placebo arm included 19 subjects who subsequently 
crossed over to receive cabozantinib; these subjects were not censored at the time of crossover and 
were analysed under the randomised placebo arm for OS analysis under intent-to-treat principles.

Table 25. Overall Survival as of CCO1 (ITT population)
A total of 86% in the cabozantinib arm was censored compared to 77% in the placebo arm. Reasons 
for censoring were “alive” (82% in the cabozantinib arm vs. 73% in the placebo arm) and “death after 
data cut-off date” (4.8% in both arms).

OS in the OITT population: The OS analysis was performed for the OITT population using the same 
analysis methods as for the ITT population. The median time of follow-up through 19 August 2020 was 
8.85 months in the OITT population. Results were consistent with those of the OS analysis in the ITT 
population: the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.25, 1.28). The 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of OS were not estimable in both arms. 
Extent of non-protocol anticancer therapies (ITT and OITT populations) 
The incidence of subsequent systemic non-radiation NPACT for each treatment arm in the ITT and OITT 
populations are summarised in the table below.

Censoring for receipt of subsequent non-protocol anticancer therapy (NPACT); ITT population: 
The OS analysis was repeated censoring survival times for subjects who received subsequent NPACT 
after randomization at the date of first receipt of such therapy; per protocol, subjects receiving these 
therapies had to discontinue study treatment. Results were consistent with those of the OS analysis for 
the ITT population: for the sensitivity analysis the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), 
was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.25, 1.10). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of OS were not 
estimable in either treatment arm. 
Thyroglobulin (Tg) change from baseline as of CCO1 (ITT population) 
Serum Tg, a tumour marker for DTC, was assessed at baseline, W5D1, W9D1, and every 8 weeks 
thereafter. 
Median Tg levels at baseline were 2027.83 ng/mL in the cabozantinib arm and 1746.30 ng/mL in the 
placebo arm. The best change from baseline was defined as the largest decrease (or smallest increase 
if no decrease) from baseline. The worst change from baseline was defined as the largest increase (or 
smallest decrease if no increase) from baseline. 
Table 27. Changes in thyroglobulin compared with baseline as of CCO1 (ITT population) 
Health-Related Quality of Life as of CCO1 (ITT population) 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, a validated questionnaire 
measuring general health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L includes a descriptive system and the EQ visual 
analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 83/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of increasing severity, 
from 1 (no problem) to 5 (extreme problems). The descriptive system is used to obtain the EQ-Index. 
The EQ VAS records the patient’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS, where the endpoints are labelled 
‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. 
Subjects completed a baseline questionnaire, and post-baseline assessments were collected every 4 
weeks (W5D1, W9D1, etc) until W25D1 followed by every 8 weeks. Assessments continued regardless 
of whether study treatment was given, reduced, interrupted, or discontinued until the later of 
investigator-assessed radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1 that was confirmed per real-
time BIRC review or the date of the decision to permanently discontinue study treatment. Subjects, 
who were blinded to treatment completed the questionnaire on the day of the visit prior to seeing 
study site personnel. Subjects were not to receive medical results prior to completing the 
questionnaire. HRQOL assessments were not collected for the 40 subjects who transitioned to the 
crossover phase or if the study transitioned to the maintenance phase. 
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire completion rate (number of subjects who completed all questions/number 
of expected subjects still on study at each visit) at baseline was 98% in the cabozantinib arm and 
100% in the placebo arm and remained above 80% in each treatment arm through Week 33. Beyond 
W33D1, there were fewer than 5 subjects in the placebo arm, too few to allow for any conclusion. 
Questionnaires were predominantly collected in subjects who were on study treatment (duration of 
study treatment was longer in the cabozantinib arm) and before progression. 
The minimal important differences (MID) for the EQ-5D-5L in cancer patients were previously 
established as 0.06 - 0.08 for EQ-5D Index, and 7 for EQ-VAS (Pickard et al 2007). In addition, for the 
EQ-Index and the EQ-VAS, the effect size for change from baseline was calculated as mean of change 
in score/pooled SD for baseline scores. An effect size ≥ 0.3 was considered potentially clinically 
meaningful (Sloan et al 2005; Yost and Eton 2005). 
EQ-Index 
Patient’s health state described by dimensions’ values was converted into a single index value 
normalised across 10 countries in which the value set has been validated. EQ-Index values were 
anchored by 0 (dead) and 1 (full health), i.e., a higher index score indicated better health.  
At baseline, mean EQ-Index scores were 0.751 in the cabozantinib arm and 0.729 in the placebo arm. 
All treatment differences in mean change from baseline EQ-Index values were < 0.06 through W33D1 
(MID = 0.06 – 0.08; see figure below). Beyond this time point there were fewer than 5 subjects in the 
placebo arm and results cannot be interpreted. 
QoL remained stable throughout the duration of the treatment up to time points with less than 5 
subjects by arm.

EQ-VAS 
At baseline, mean EQ-VAS scores for the ITT population were 69.4 in the cabozantinib arm and 67.8 in 
the placebo arm. All treatment differences in mean change from baseline EQ-VAS values were < 7 
through W33D1 (MID = 7; see figure below). Beyond this time point, there were fewer than 5 subjects 
in the placebo arm, so results cannot be interpreted.

The supportive analysis of the OS endpoint was performed using the Full ITT population and Primary 
Analysis subset as of CCO2. In the Full ITT population, a total of 58 deaths (37 cabozantinib, 21 
placebo) were reported at CCO2 (see table below), compared with 31 deaths reported at CCO1. 
Survival status as of the data cut-off date was determined for all 258 randomized subjects. Of note, 
133 subjects (78%) in the cabozantinib arm and 67 subjects (76%) in the placebo arm were censored 
at their last known alive dates including 2 cabozantinib subjects who died after data cut-off. 
Table 32. Overall Survival as of CCO2 (Full ITT population and Primary Analysis Subset)
As can be seen from the table above, the K-M estimate in the full ITT population for median duration of 
OS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 15.9, NE) in the cabozantinib arm and NE in the placebo arm, HR was 
0.76 (95% CI stratified: 0.45, 1.31). However, due to the immaturity of the data, this estimate is not 
reliable at present. 
Of note, the tail of the K-M curve for the full ITT population (see below) and median estimate for OS 
are unstable due to the low number of subjects at risk with the longest follow up times and an event 
experienced by the subject with the longest follow-up. The placebo arm of the full ITT population 
included 40 subjects who crossed over to receive cabozantinib, 8 of whom had an event. The other 32

subjects were censored; of these subjects, 12 had at least 6 months of post-crossover survival and 2 
were still on open-label cabozantinib as of CCO2. The placebo crossover subjects were not censored at 
the time of crossover and were analysed under the randomised placebo arm for OS analysis under ITT 
principles.

Overall Survival: censoring for receipt of subsequent non-protocol anticancer therapy (Full ITT 
population and Primary Analysis Subset)  
As a sensitivity analysis, the OS analysis was repeated censoring survival times for subjects who 
received subsequent NPACT after randomization at the date of first receipt of such therapy; per 
protocol, subjects receiving these therapies had to discontinue study treatment. Placebo subjects 
receiving open-label cabozantinib upon crossover were analysed under the randomized placebo arm for 
OS based on ITT principles. Receipt of open-label cabozantinib is not considered receipt of NPACT. 
Therefore the 40 and 35 subjects randomized to the placebo arm in the Full ITT population and 
Primary Analysis subset, respectively, who crossed over to receive open-label cabozantinib were not 
censored for having received NPACT in the sensitivity analysis for OS. 
The results for the OS sensitivity analysis for receipt of subsequent NPACT were consistent with the 
corresponding OS analyses for the Full ITT population and for the Primary Analysis subset. HR for Full 
ITT population (both stratified and unstratified) of 0.67 (95% CI stratified: 0.38, 1.17 and unstratified: 
0.38, 1.18). For the Primary Analysis Subset HR (both stratified and unstratified) was 0.64 (95% CI 
stratified: 0.35, 1.14 and unstratified: 0.36, 1.14). 
Pharmacogenetics and biomarkers 
Unless prohibited by local regulations, failure to grant informed consent for this purpose, or Sponsor 
decision, a blood sample was collected pre-dose on W1D1 for genotyping/single nucleotide 
polymorphism/copy number variation analysis to correlate genetic variation with PK, safety, tolerability 
of and response to study treatment. Blood samples were also collected to evaluate plasma and/or 
serum biomarkers pre-dose on W1D1, W5D1, and W9D1 (each ± 3 days). Of note though, 
pharmacogenetic and biomarker samples were not analysed for this CSR. 
Subgroup analyses 
Progression-Free Survival by subgroup as of CCO1 (ITT population) 
Subgroup analyses of the primary PFS analysis is summarised in the Forest plot shown in the figure

In the Full ITT Population (N = 258), subgroup analyses continued to show a consistently favourable 
effect of cabozantinib on PFS: almost all estimable HRs were < 1 and almost all upper limits of 95% 
CIs were < 1 (exception was for the subgroup of Black or African American who comprised a very low 
number of subjects; 2 patients in each of the treatment arms. For the subgroups that had upper limit

of 95% CI > 1 in the ITT population, race Asian and region Asia, these limits were now <1 while the 
subgroup “no prior receipt of RAI” were NA, for both the Full ITT Population and the Primary Analysis 
subset).  
In the Primary Analysis Subset (N = 187), subgroup analyses showed a consistently favourable effect 
of cabozantinib on PFS: almost all estimable HRs were < 1 and all upper limits of 95% CIs were < 1.  
Overall survival 
Analyses of OS by subgroup conducted in the ITT population are shown in the forest plot below. Of 
note, since the majority of subjects were alive as of the data cut-off date, there are not enough events 
to make meaningful conclusions for OS subgroups.

Analyses of OS by subgroup conducted in the Full ITT population and for the Primary Analysis subset 
showed only small differences from the analyses of OS for subgroup for the ITT population (data not 
shown). Also, for these two populations, there were too few events to interpret OS subgroup analyses 
as most of the subjects were alive as of CCO2. 
Summary of main study 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). Presented in the table below is the results from the 
prespecified primary interim PFS analysis with clinical cut-off date 19 August 2020.

Study Identifier 
XL184-311 
Design 
Study XL184-311 was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of cabozantinib in subjects with Radioiodine 
(RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who had progressed 
during or after prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-
targeted therapy, with objective response rate (ORR) and progression-
free survival (PFS) as the multiple primary efficacy endpoints.

Approximately 300 eligible subjects who met all study eligibility criteria 
were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either cabozantinib or 
cabozantinib-matched placebo, as follows: Cabozantinib arm - Oral 
cabozantinib (60 mg) qd, and Placebo arm - Oral cabozantinib-matched 
placebo qd.  Randomisation was stratified by receipt of prior lenvatinib 
and age at informed consent (≤ 65 years vs > 65 years). All subjects 
received best supportive care (BSC) in addition to the randomised study 
treatment. 
Study Period: 27 February 2019 (first subject randomised) - 19 August 
2020 (data cutoff date; minimum of 6 months’ follow-up for the first 100 
subjects)

N/A 
Supportive studies 
In patients with RAI-refractory DTC, preliminary clinical activity of cabozantinib has been demonstrated 
in two clinical trials. Short summaries of the main results from these two trials are given below. 
•  Single-arm Phase 1 study (XL184-00; drug-drug interaction study), 15 subjects with advanced, 
metastatic DTC refractory to standard therapy with RAI were enrolled (Cabanillas et al 2014). 
Most patients (11/15) in the DTC cohort had received at least one VEGFR-targeted therapy, 
whereof 10/15 patients had received prior sorafenib. All patients had progressed during or 
after their most recent systemic therapy prior to study entry. The initial dose in this study was 
140 mg cabozantinib (Cometriq, capsule formulation) per day. Subjects in the DTC cohort 
received a median average daily dose of 62 mg cabozantinib. The ORR (exploratory endpoint) 
for DTC subjects in this study was 53%, and 40% of DTC subjects achieved stable disease as 
best response. Of the 11 patients pre-treated with a VEGFR inhibitor, 5 had a confirmed PR – 4 
of whom had prior sorafenib therapy.  All 14 evaluable patients had tumour regression. 
Duration of response ranged from 2.0 to 14.5+ months. Median PFS and OS were not reached 
(median follow-up was 12 months and 26 months, respectively). 
•  A Phase 2, single-arm Investigator-sponsored study (NCT01811212) enrolled 25 subjects with 
RAI-refractory DTC who had progressed after one or two prior VEGFR-targeted therapies 
(Cabanillas et al 2017). Twenty-one patients had received only one prior VEGFR-targeted 
therapy (12/25 sorafenib, 5/25 pazopanib, or 4/25 cediranib), and four patients had received 
two such therapies. Of note, 1 patient had used lenvatinib and pazopanid in combination while 
1 patient had used a combination of sorafenib + pazopanib and 1 patient had used a

combination of sorafenib + cediranib. The initial dose in this study was 60 mg cabozantinib 
(tablet formulation) per day. The ORR was 40%, and 52% of subjects had stable disease as 
best response. The number of prior VEGFR therapies was associated with response: PR was 
achieved in 10 of 21 patients (48%) with only one prior VEGFR-targeted therapy, whereas zero 
of four responses (0%) were seen in patients who received two prior VEGFR-targeted 
therapies. However, variable degrees of tumour reduction (6%, 19%, and 30%) were seen in 
three evaluable patients who received two prior VEGFR-targeted therapies. The authors 
concluded (among other things) that one (as opposed to two) prior VEGFR-targeted treatment 
was associated with a better response rate. Median duration of response was 11 months. The 
median PFS was 13 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11, 35), and the median OS was 35 
months (95% CI: 18, not reached). Dose reductions to 40 mg occurred in 56% of subjects, 
and further reductions to 20 mg occurred in 32% of subjects.   
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted to support the claimed indication is . Study XL184-311 a 
Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, global clinical trial which  primary 
objective was to evaluate efficacy and safety of cabozantinib as monotherapy in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and who are refractory or not eligible to 
radioactive iodine (RAI) and have progressed during or after prior VEGFR-targeted therapy. Subjects 
were randomised to receive either cabozantinib or placebo and stratified by age (≤65 years vs. > 65 
years) and receipt of prior lenvatinib (yes or no). Considering that age is an important prognostic 
factor in DTC, with better survival observed in younger patients, it is reasonable to stratify for this 
factor. “AJCC/TNM 2016 8th edition criteria” operates with a cut-off for patients with a lower age cut-off 
< and > 55 years but considering that most subjects included in the study were diagnosed with DTC 
several years before being enrolled into the study and other factors than age might be of higher 
prognostic factor (such as e.g., tumor size, node metastasis, extranodal tumor extension and degree 
of distant metastasis) the age data cut-off chosen can be agreed.  
Currently, any experience of potential activity of cabozantinib in patients who have previously used 
lenvatinib is limited. When taking into account that there might be differential efficacy in lenvatinib-
exposed and unexposed patients, it is reasonable to secure a balance in the study between these two 
patient groups. No biomarkers have been validated to successfully determine who will respond best to 
lenvatinib or sorafenib (Gild et al, 2017).  
The randomisation was 2:1, thereby allowing more subjects the chance to receive active treatment.  
The use of a blinded and independent radiological assessment of PFS in order to reduce possible 
investigator bias is endorsed. Crossover to cabozantinib was optional for subjects initially randomised 
to placebo upon experiencing radiographic disease progression) as confirmed by BIRC.  
The design of the study is in general acceptable. 
Study population. Generally, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study XL184-311 appears to 
largely reflect the target population of the indication sought. This population ought to be refractory or 
not eligible to RAI. The patients had to have received either lenvatinib or sorafenib previously before 
inclusion, and thus being refractory towards RAI is a requirement. Hence, it is assumed that the RAI 
refractoriness of each patient has already been evaluated before any of the two TKIs were given. In 
regards to patients being ”non-eligible”, the enrolment aimed to include subjects who had an intact 
Assessment report

thyroid gland as this would normally preclude treatment with RAI. Five patients in the study were 
deemed ineligible for RAI treatment, and it seems that all these patients had either a complete or 
partial thyroid gland. 
Only patients with ECOG 0 or 1 were eligible, implying a quite fit population. 
Patients had to have previously been treated with at least one of the two VEGFR-targeting TKIs 
lenvatinib or sorafenib. However, up to two VEGFR-targeting TKI agents were allowed (this had to 
include lenvatinib or sorafenib but were not limited to those). Furthermore, patients were not excluded 
if they previously had received maximum 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor or 1 systemic chemotherapy 
regimen. These broad entry criteria could lead to a rather heterogenous population potentially making 
it challenging to demonstrate the optimal use of cabozantinib in this setting. Patients had to have 
experienced documented radiographic progression per RECIST per the investigator. 
Comparator. The study is placebo-controlled. Considering that there are no consensus/approved 
drugs/combination therapies for patients with RAI-refractory DTC who have progressed during or after 
prior VEGFR-targeted therapy, the use of placebo as control is viewed as acceptable.  
Endpoints. The multiple primary objectives of the study were to compare PFS and ORR per RECIST 
1.1 by BIRC in patients treated with cabozantinib vs. placebo. The use of PFS as a primary endpoint is 
acceptable. However, using solely ORR as a primary endpoint would not have been considered 
acceptable for this study. Among endpoints listed as additional were OS, DoR, safety and PRO-data.  
The inclusion of cross-over data makes the analysis of OS less clear-cut and limits the interpretation of 
these results. Only evaluation of a potential detriment to survival with the cabozantinib treatment will 
therefore be possible to extract from these OS analyses. Notwithstanding this, considered the lack of 
treatment alternatives for this patient group, it would be unethical not to offer placebo patients the 
opportunity to cross over to a potentially beneficial treatment.  
Statistical analysis. The statistical methods used for analysis, including sensitivity analyses, handling 
of missing values, methods for controlling the Type-I error and sample size calculations, are in general 
acceptable. The use of an ITT population for hypothesis testing and estimation is endorsed. PFS and 
ORR were defined as multiple primary endpoints, and study success was to be declared if at least one 
null hypothesis was rejected. A modified Bonferroni procedure was used to control the Type-I error, 
dividing the alpha between them. While from a statistical point of view rejecting only one of the null 
hypotheses for ORR or PFS could be acceptable, the outcome could have been problematic, since, in 
line with the above, rejecting solely the ORR null hypothesis would not have been sufficient for this 
study. The primary analysis for ORR was performed by Fisher’s exact test. According to guidelines it 
should have been planned to include stratification factors used in the randomisation in the analysis of 
the primary endpoints, and therefore to also ensure enough subjects in important strata were included. 
However, the MAH has provided supplementary analyses that were stratified according to stratification 
factors used in randomisation, showing consistent results. Likewise, being a multi-center study, the 
analysis should have been stratified by center, or region. Also, in this case sensitivity analyses by 
region have been submitted, showing consistent results. Censoring subjects with progression after two 
or more missed assessments, or receiving subsequent or additional anti-cancer therapy, for the 
primary PFS analysis is not in agreement with the preferred analysis recommended by the guidelines. 
However, this applies to only a few patients, and sensitivity analyses that assign these as events 
instead of censoring are consistent with the primary analysis, and therefore this has not had a 
significant impact on the results.  
The final analysis showed that the ORR null hypothesis could not be rejected, while PFS demonstrated 
statistically significant results. Consequently, PFS became the only primary endpoint demonstrating the 
benefit of cabozantinib over placebo.

Cabozantinib dose. The recommended adult dose is 60 mg cabozantinib once daily. This dose has 
already received approval for patients with advanced RCC and HCC. Cabozantinib 60 mg qd (as 
tablets) has also shown preliminary efficacy in an Investigator-sponsored study (ISS) in subjects with 
DTC. In Study XL184-311, no ER relationship between PFS and average cabozantinib concentration 
was observed in DTC subjects supporting a dose of 60 mg QD in adults with or without dose 
modification (i.e., 40 mg or 20 mg). With regard to adolescents, PK modelling and simulation is used 
by the MAH in an effort to support a cabozantinib starting dose of 60 mg qd for adolescents with body 
weight ≥ 40 kg and a starting dose of 40 mg qd for adolescents with body weight < 40 kg, based on 
the aim to obtain comparable exposure. Further optimisation of the popPK model was requested in 
order to be able to make a final conclusion on the appropriate dose for this age group. The MAH has 
performed additional modelling and simulation (M&S) exercises testing several models, essentially 
yielding a comparable predicted exposure. The proposed dose advice based on M&S with the original 
full popPK Model 1 is considered sufficiently robust. Consequently, the dose advice for patients <40 kg 
based on this M&S approach is considered acceptable from a PK point of view.   
Study conduct. No global amendments were made to the original protocol, only 4 country-specific 
amendments and one country-specific addendum (in Germany, Canada, France, and UK, respectively). 
These amendments mainly concerned addition of various clarifications and modifications (including for 
some of the inclusion and exclusion criteria). Certain special accommodations were also performed in 
regards to the global COVID-19 pandemic but were implemented for only a few countries and not 
globally. As none of the amendments were deemed to affect the study population, schedule of 
assessment or the endpoints of the study, it was deemed unnecessary to implement them globally. 
This is acknowledged. No specific GCP-related issues were revealed during the assessment.  The MAH 
has informed that no EU (or alternatively non-EU) inspections of study sites and/or CROs have been 
conducted 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary efficacy analyses of cabozantinib were based on the pre-specified primary endpoint analysis of 
ORR in the first 100 randomised subjects (i.e., 67 subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 33 subjects in 
the placebo arm; called the OITT population). In addition, a pre-specified interim primary endpoint 
analysis of PFS from the 187 subjects (i.e., 125 cabozantinib, 62 placebo, called the ITT population) 
randomised as of clinical cut-off 1 (CCO1) on 19 August 2020 was provided. CCO1 was set 6 months 
after the first 100th subject randomised, resulting in a median duration of follow-up of 6.24 months 
and 8.85 months for the PFS and ORR analysis, respectively. After the 19 August 2020 cut-off, 
subjects continued to enrol in the study and receive blinded study treatment. 
The PFS analysis was regularly reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee, and based on 
the significant results, the committee recommended to stop enrolment. Thus, the last subject was 
randomised on 02 February 2021. From August 2020 to February 2021 a total of 71 additional patients 
were enrolled (45 more in the cabozantinib arm and 26 more in the placebo arm), giving a total of 258 
subjects (i.e., 170 subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 88 subjects in the placebo arm). This 
population was called the Full ITT population. A second clinical cut-off of 08 February 2021 (CCO2) was 
then used to provide efficacy data of the Full ITT population and longer follow-up of the Primary 
Analysis Subset (i.e., the ITT population consisting of the initially 187 subjects). The corresponding 
supportive analysis was focused on updated efficacy analyses by BIRC of PFS, ORR, and OS. There 
were two dates for database lock, i.e., 19 August 2020 and 08 February 2021. In general, subjects 
with BIRC-determined radiographic PD via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system could be 
unblinded during the study, and those subjects belonging to the placebo group had the option to cross

over to the cabozantinib group. On 16 April 2021 all sites were ultimately unblinded (i.e., after the 
efficacy analyses were finalised). 
Baseline and disease characteristics. In general, the baseline patient demographic and 
disease/tumour characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms in the ITT 
population (N=187). In both arms subjects were predominantly white with median age around 65 
years, ~ 55% were females and 52% were enrolled in Europe. The proportion of Asian subjects was 
16% in cabozantinib group vs. 23% in the placebo group. Around 50% in each arm was < 65 years or 
≥ 65 years and 63% in each arm had previously received lenvatinib (stratification factors).  
Overall, the baseline disease history of the enrolled patients reflected the population intended for 
treatment and was mainly equally distributed between the two arms. The included patients had either 
the papillary subtype of DTC (~ 55%) or follicular subtype (45-50%). Of the patients with follicular 
subtype, 17% had Hürthle cell thyroid cancer. Approximately 95% of patients in both arms had 
metastatic disease and measurable disease. It is noted that no patients were stated to have locally 
advanced disease while the proposed indication includes also “locally advanced”. Considering that 
patients with locally advanced disease will receive the same treatment as patients with metastatic 
disease and efficacy in locally advanced therapy can be assumed, this is acceptable. This is also in 
alignment with the other TKis for differentiated thyroid cancer, sorafenib and lenvatinib 
Almost all patients in both arms were stated to be refractory to prior RAI therapy. The most common 
reason for refractoriness was “disease progression despite RAI avidity” (> 60% in both arms) and no 
demonstration of RAI uptake (> 20% in both arms).  
Approximately a total of 52% of subjects had received prior radiation therapy for DTC (most commonly 
was external beam radiation therapy with ~ 45% in each arm).  
The protocol allowed inclusion of patients who had received a maximum of two previous VEGFR-TKI 
agents for DTC. However, > 70% of the patients in both arms received only one prior VEGFR-TKI. Of 
these, 63% in each arm had received prior treatment with lenvatinib. Sorafenib had been used 
previously by 62% in the cabozantinib vs. 56% in the placebo arm. This quite equal proportion of 
patients receiving prior sorafenib and prior lenvatinib might reflect that the availability of lenvatinib is 
limited in some countries and regions. Around 25% in the cabozantinib arm vs. 21% in the placebo 
arm had received prior treatment with both lenvatinib and sorafenib. For around 50% of the patients in 
each treatment arm the “context of therapy” were stated to be “adjuvant therapy” where “adjuvant 
therapy” mainly comprised radioactive iodine. In the remaining cases, the therapy was a systemic 
treatment such as lenvatinib, sorafenib and/or another therapy.  
Multiple primary endpoints  
PFS 
Results from the prespecified primary interim analysis of the ITT population (N=187; 125 in the 
cabozantinib arm and 62 in the placebo arm), clinical cut-off 19 August 2020, median follow-up 6.24 
months: 
A statistically significant benefit in PFS were observed for cabozantinib over placebo (HR = 0.22, 96% 
CI [stratified]: 0.13, 0.36; stratified log-rank test p-value <0.0001). The PFS data were rather 
immature for the cabozantinib arm (25% events vs. 69% in the placebo arm, respectively). Median 
PFS in the cabozantinib arm was not reached (96% CI: 5.7, NE) vs. 1.9 (96% CI: 1.8, 3.6) months in 
the placebo arm. The main reasons for censoring were no event by last adequate tumour assessment 
(ATA) (54% in the cabozantinib arm vs. 16% in the placebo arm) and no post-baseline ATA (18% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 108/154 
 
 
 
 
 
the cabozantinib arm vs. 13% in the placebo arm). Very few patients were censored due to 2 or more 
missed ATA prior to event (2.4% in the cabozantinib arm vs. 0 in the placebo arm) and receipt of local 
radiation to soft tissue for DTC (0.8% for the cabozantinib arm and 1.6% in the placebo arm). No 
patients were censored due to subsequent NPACT. This low number of censoring due to missed ATA is 
reassuring in regards to the size of the effect of informative censoring. Separation of the Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) curves favouring cabozantinib occurred early (around 1 month), and with no crossing of the 
curves. The curve for the placebo arm shows an early steep fall (at around 2 months). This time point 
coincides with the median time to progression of ~ 1.8 months (range 0.6-7.1) for the placebo arm, 
and at that time point placebo patients could cross over to the cabozantinib arm. 
Results of the sensitivity analyses and other supplementary analyses (including the analysis using PFS 
as assessed by the Investigator) were consistent with the primary efficacy results supporting the 
robustness of the primary analysis.  
The updated PFS analyses performed at clinical cut-off 08 February 2021 in the Full ITT population 
(N=258; 170 in the cabozantinib arm and 88 in the placebo arm) and with a median follow-up of 10.1 
months, were in support of the primary PFS analysis. The median PFS (cabozantinib vs. placebo) was 
stated to be 11.0 (96% CI: 7.4, 13.8) vs. 1.9 (96% CI: 1.9, 3.7) months. A gain in PFS of around 9 
months is considered clinically relevant in a setting where the therapeutic alternatives are limited.  The 
results for the Primary Analysis Subset (median follow-up: 11.9 months) were in line with the results 
observed for the Full ITT population.  
The median PFS in the placebo arm was short (1.9 months in all analyses) indicating a patient 
population with rapidly progressing disease. The updated analyses continued to demonstrate 
separation of the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves favouring cabozantinib, with no crossing of the curves. 
The PFS outcome is considered clinically relevant in a disease setting with few alternative treatment 
options. 
ORR  
For ORR a pre-specified primary endpoint analysis of the OITT population (N=100; 67 in the 
cabozantinib arm and 33 in the placebo arm), median follow-up 8.85 months, was performed at clinical 
cut-off 19 August 2020. However, this primary endpoint was not met as the study failed to reject the 
null hypothesis of ORR at the pre-specified alpha of 1%. There is therefore not sufficient sample 
evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in ORR between cabozantinib and placebo. 
Consequently, ORR cannot confirm the primary PFS endpoint.  
The observed ORR in the cabozantinib arm was rather modest; 15% (99% CI: 5.8, 29.3) vs. 0% (99% 
CI: 0.0, 14.8) in the placebo arm (unstratified p-value of 0.0281 using Fisher’s Exact Test). All 
objective responses in the cabozantinib arm were partial (10/67) vs. none in the placebo arm. The rate 
of stable disease in the cabozantinib arm relative to placebo was higher (69% vs. 42%, respectively). 
This could imply that the PFS effect of cabozantinib primarily might be caused by disease stabilisation, 
rather than a decrease in tumour burden. Conversely, more subjects in the placebo arm had 
progressive disease (55% vs. 6% in the cabozantinib arm). The disease stabilisation rate (DSR; 
ORR+SD ≥ 16 weeks) were 60% vs. 27% in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively. 
It is noticed that higher ORR values were observed for cabozantinib in the phase 1 (XL184-00) and 2 
(NCT01811212) studies (53% and 40%, respectively), while the ORR value used for planning the 
pivotal study was 35%. However, the phase 1 and 2 trials were small and single armed, and in the 
Phase 1 study a higher dose of cabozantinib was used (140 mg qd in the form of a capsule which is not 
bioequivalent with the tablet formulation), thus direct comparisons would not be entirely valid. 
Although cross trial comparisons of ORR have its obvious limitations and encumbered with a high 
degree of uncertainty, it is still noted that low response rates have also been previously reported in 
Assessment report

studies for other indications for cabozantinib (EPAR, EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0005, EPAR, 
EMEA/H/C/004163/0000).  
In the cabozantinib arm the median (range) time from randomisation to the first objective response 
per BIRC was 2.5 months (1.74, 3.94) in the OITT population. The median duration of response (DoR) 
per BIRC was not evaluable (median not reached) at CCO1.  
Updated data for the Full ITT population, per clinical cut-off 08 February 2021, were in agreement with 
the results reported at CCO1 (ORR was 11% [95% CI: 6.9, 16.9] and 0% [95% CI: 0.0, 4.1] in the 
cabozantinib arm vs. the placebo arm, respectively). Median DoR per BIRC was 10.2 months and 
median time to objective response per BIRC was 3.58 months (1.74, 7.52) in the cabozantinib arm. 
Secondary endpoints 
OS. The analysis of OS in the ITT population at clinical cut-off 19 August 2020 were immature (86% 
and 77% of the patients being censored in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively). The 
median was not reached in either study arm. HR was 0.54 (95% CI [stratified]: 0.27, 1.11) with an 
observed p-value (stratified log-rank test) of 0.0879. The K-M plot is characterised by a lot of 
censoring in both arms.  
Of note, the placebo arm included 19 subjects who subsequently crossed over to receive cabozantinib, 
constituting around 29% (19/62) of the total number of placebo patients. For these patients, selected 
demographic and baseline characteristics were re-established immediately prior to crossover. The 
median age was consistent with that in the cabozantinib arm (ITT population). However, a higher 
proportion of subjects in the placebo crossover arm had a baseline ECOG PS of 1 immediately prior to 
crossover compared with the cabozantinib arm (74% vs. 53%, respectively). The median time to 
progression while on placebo per BIRC was 1.77 months (range: 0.6 -7.1 months) in the placebo 
crossover arm. 
These subjects were not censored at the time of crossover as receipt of open-label cabozantinib was 
not considered receipt of NPACT. Thus, these subjects were analysed under the randomised placebo 
arm for OS analysis under intent-to-treat principles. Due to the inclusion of placebo patients receiving 
cabozantinib in the placebo arm, this arm performs better than would otherwise be expected.  
Overall, there was a low number of patients in the ITT population who received subsequent NPACT in 
the study (2.4% in the cabozantinib arm vs. 6.5% in the placebo arm; the majority of these NPACTs 
were TKIs). The relatively infrequent use of subsequent NPACT probably reflects the lack of alternative 
therapies in this setting. Results for the OS sensitivity analysis for receipt of subsequent NPACT were 
consistent with the corresponding main OS analysis. 
In the updated analysis for the Full ITT population, per clinical cut-off 08 February 2021, the number 
of patients crossing over from the placebo arm to the cabozantinib arm had increased from 19 to 40. 
Eight of these 40 patients had an event. The other 32 subjects were censored; of these subjects, 12 
had at least 6 months of post-crossover survival and 2 were still on open label cabozantinib as of 08 
February 2021. As a consequence of this, OS of the cabozantinib arm will be more heavily confounded. 
In the Full ITT population, HR for OS was 0.76 (95% CI [stratified]: 0.45, 1.31). The data are still 
immature, and the follow-up is not long enough to provide a reliable estimate of the median, 
nevertheless no apparent detrimental effect on survival in the cabozantinib arm is currently observed.  
The analysis for the Primary Analysis Subset (in this subset 35 placebo patients had crossed over) was 
in line with the analysis for the Full ITT population (HR=0.74, 95% CI [stratified]: 0.42, 1.28). As for 
the PFS analyses (see above) no further updated OS analyses are available or planned. It is 
acknowledged that due to crossover, OS would be difficult to interpret.

HRQoL. The PROs were captured through the use of the validated questionnaire EQ-5D-5L (which 
includes EQ-Index and EQ-VAS). At the various time points for completion of the questionnaires, the 
majority of the 95% CIs were overlapping between the cabozantinib and placebo arms for the 
measured dimensions in the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The HRQoL results are considered to be of a 
descriptive, hypothesis-generating nature and the number of patients is limited. Considering that the 
placebo patients had a rather short time to progression (median around 1.8 months), and would then 
cross over to the cabozantinib arm, the time period where there would be an actual comparison in QoL 
between placebo and cabozantinib is quite short. Furthermore, it is not considered that these data 
would lead to any difference in clinical management or inform treatment decisions. In conclusion, the 
data are not regarded adequate to include in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Subgroups. Many subgroups were analysed and the size and number of events in each subgroup 
varied. Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference. Notwithstanding this, it 
is noted that a benefit in PFS in favour of the cabozantinib arm was seen across all subgroups for the 
ITT population (cut-off 19 August 2020) with HRs being < 1. Almost all upper limits of 95% CIs were 
also < 1 (exceptions occurred in subgroups with a very low number of subjects). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
No patients < 18 years were included in the pivotal study. The MAH presented PK data to demonstrate 
comparable exposure of cabozantinib between adolescents and adults implying that extrapolation of 
efficacy from adult to adolescents could be adequate. Moreover , the MAH stated that there is 
biological similarity of the diseases in adolescents and adult subjects.  
However, some important differences between paediatric and adult DTC are reported in the literature. 
Zanella et al (2021) refers to that DTC in paediatric patients is characterised as a distinct disease from 
that observed in adults, with particularities in the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term 
outcomes. Differences in the molecular pathology of the tumour between adult and paediatric DTC 
have been reported. Paediatric patents more often than adults present with aggressive, advanced 
stage disease, but still the prognosis is better compared to older adults. Galuppini et al (2019) 
suggests, as it seems that younger paediatric patients have a more aggressive tumour at diagnosis in 
terms of extent, lymph node involvement and distant metastases than older patients, and that DTC in 
childhood is locally more aggressive, that it should be considered as a distinct clinical entity also from 
DTC in adolescence..  
The American Thyroid Association (ATA), accounting for the differences observed in paediatric vs. adult 
DTC, has published specific guidelines for thyroid nodule and DTC for children (Francis et al, 2015). In 
these guidelines (it is stated that although more studies are required regarding the use of agents like 
sorafenib (and lenvatinib) in children, particularly with respect to dosing and toxicity, the use of 
molecularly targeted therapies may be contemplated in the rare situation in which a child warrants 
systemic treatment. However, it is pointed out that it is difficult to define iodine-refractory disease in 
paediatric DTC, and iodine-refractory DTC can remain stable over years of follow-up. For that reason, 
all children being considered for anti-neoplastic therapy should be referred to centers familiar with the 
use of these therapeutic agents in thyroid cancer. 
In the EU no medicinal products are currently approved for treatment of specifically DTC in patients < 
18 years.  
From literature submitted by the MAH, Sapuppo et al (2021) and Galuppini et al 2019 it seems that 
paediatric DTC patients are mainly treated with the same modalities as adult DTC patients., However, 
it appear like there are some differences concerning when to start further treatment. External beam 
radiotherapy might be relevant for selected patients. Given the longer life span of paediatric patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 111/154 
 
 
 
 
compared to adults, the risk of secondary cancer will be higher, and a more conservative approach is 
generally taken towards using adjuvant RAI in paediatric DTC patients and external radiation in 
paediatric DTC patients who have become refractory to RAI. For adult DTC patients who become RAI-
refractory and have exhausted local treatment options, the next step in the treatment hierarchy is 
usually the TKis lenvatinib and/or sorafenib. None of these 2 agents are currently approved for 
treatment of patients < 18 years of age. As RET mutations seem to be more prevalent in paediatric 
DTC patients, treatment with specific RET inhibitors would be of interest. In the EU praseltinib 
(Gavreto) is not approved for thyroid cancer while selpercatinib (brand name Retsevmo in Europe) is 
approved (among other indications) for advanced RET fusion positive thyroid cancer (after prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib), although only for adults.   
Although an increase in incidences of paediatric thyroid carcinoma is reported (Howlader 2019), it is 
acknowledged that the number of these specific paediatric patients with RAI refractory DTC is 
extremely limited. An incidence of paediatric DTC of 0.2 to 3 cases/million children/year has been 
reported (Lebbink et al., 2020). Klein Hesselink et al (2016) reported age-standardised incidence rates 
for DTC for children 0–4 years of age of 0.4 per 100 000, and up to 1.5 per 100 000 for adolescents 
aged 15–19 years. Considering the normally high cure rates and good prognosis for children with DTC, 
a condition of relapsed/refractory DTC in paediatric patients would be even rarer and only make up a 
small subset. Consequently, it seems unfeasible to conduct randomised controlled trials in this patient 
group.  
At present, cabozantinib is not approved in paediatric patients for any indication, hence the experience 
with cabozantinib and knowledge of its potential efficacy in paediatric patients is sparse.  The MAH 
summarised any efficacy data available from use of cabozantinib in paediatric patients presenting the 
following studies:  
•  Study 4 of the PIP, called XL184-011 or ADVL1211. This is a completed phase 1 study  which 
evaluated the starting dose of cabozantinib in 39 children and adolescents (age ≥ 2 - ≤18 
years) with refractory solid tumours. Five patients had MTC (none with DTC), 2 partial 
responses and 2 stable disease were reported (the study had no primary efficacy endpoint). In 
addition, one patient with Wilms tumor and one patient with clear cell sarcoma both reported 
partial responses. A dose of 40 mg/m2 was recommended for further evaluation in a phase 2 
study.  
•  Study 7 of the PIP, XL189 or also called ADVL1622 is performed by the Children’s Oncology 
Group (COG). It is an ongoing open-label trial evaluating the safety and activity of the 40 
mg/m2 dose of cabozantinib in children aged 2 years to < 18 years (and young adults) with a 
relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumour. The final clinical study report is expected by 
April 2022 Patients with various sarcomas were enrolled in addition to a cohort consisting of 
“rare tumours”. In the latter group there was one patient with “RET fusion positive PTC” who 
had a partial response. Overall, it was concluded that cabozantinib is active in patients with 
relapsed refractory osteosarcoma (10/29 patients) and deserved to be further studied. 
However, the age of these specific patients is not mentioned by Akshintala et al (2021). 
Clinical activity of cabozantinib was limited in other sarcomas (Ewing sarcoma, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma) and Wilms tumour. In 
addition, a randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group safety and efficacy clinical trial 
of cabozantinib in patients aged from birth to less than 18 years with a malignant solid 
tumour(s) is reportedly planned  
• 
The MAH also referred to a phase 2 single-arm trial called study CABONE (French Sarcoma 
Group; Italiano et al, 2020). Paediatric patients < 16 years were to receive a dose of 40 
mg/m2. Cabozantinib showed antitumor activity (partial responses) in 10 and 5 patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 112/154 
 
 
 
 
Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma (OST), respectively. Information regarding the age of 
these specific patients could not be found. However, it has to be taken into account that only a 
total of 8/90 patients (2 with EWS and 6 with OST) < 18 years were included in the study.  
Efficacy data available from use of cabozantinib in paediatric patients, is very limited and for DTC 
virtually non-existing. Apart from one patient (in Study ADVL1622) reported to have “RET fusion 
positive PTC”, none of the studies included paediatric patients with RAI-refractory DTC.  
The MAH presented an extrapolation approach to support the indication for adolescent 12-18 years of 
age. 
In order to accept an efficacy assessment solely based on the concept of extrapolation, a reasonable 
degree of certainty, that the disease, progression of disease, treatment and prognosis are similar for 
adolescents and adults is a prerequisite.  In addition, the proposed doses should lead to comparable 
exposures and a similar PK/response relation. The original full popPK model is sufficiently robust to 
support the recommended dose for patients ≥12-<18 years therefore from a PK point of view, it is 
considered acceptable, to extrapolate from adults to adolescents. These data are included in the SmPC 
section 5.2. No ER relationship between average cabozantinib concentration and PFS was observed.  
As previously mentioned, biological, molecular/genetic and clinicopathological disparities exist between 
paediatric and adult DTC.  
Overall efficacy data from use of cabozantinib in paediatric patients, and for DTC it is virtually non-
existing (one adolescent patient with “RET fusion positive PTC”, has been identified). According to the 
sought indication, cabozantinib is intended to be used in a late treatment line, i.e., after prior systemic 
therapy has failed. Consequently, the anticipated effect of cabozantinib will not only be depended on 
the basic treatment of surgery and RAI, but also on the type of systemic therapy the adolescent 
patient has previously failed on. This adds to the uncertainty of whether it can be assumed that the 
efficacy between adults and adolescents will be sufficiently comparable and consequently allow for an 
extrapolation between the two patient populations.  
Due to a very low incidence of paediatric patients with DTC and an even lower incidence with RAI-
refractory DTC, obtaining further clinical study data for this group of patients seem to be unfeasible. It 
is acknowledged that there is an unmet medical need for the few paediatric patients that would require 
further treatment beyond RAI and other systemic therapy. For these patients, cabozantinib might be 
an option. Notwithstanding this, it is still unclear whether the disease histology, genetic background, 
treatment and prognosis are sufficiently comparable between adults and adolescents making it justified 
to extrapolate the efficacy of cabozantinib from adult patients to adolescent patients. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study XL184-311, cabozantinib demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant improvement in PFS per BIRC compared with placebo in adult patients. This result is 
encouraging in a patient group with few alternative treatment options. The OS data are still 
immature,and  no further updates of the OS analysis will be available due to the influence of 
crossover. It is noted however, that despite crossover of patients from the placebo arm, no apparent 
detrimental effect on survival in the cabozantinib arm is currently observed.  
With regards to patients ≥12 -<18 years, the assessment of cabozantinib’s efficacy in this patient 
group would mainly depend on the adequacy of extrapolating the efficacy data from adults. At present, 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 113/154 
 
 
 
 
 
it is not considered that the available data are convincingly enough to unequivocally conclude that the 
disease histology, genetic background, treatment and prognosis are sufficiently comparable between 
adults and adolescents allowing for an extrapolation of efficacy data from adults to adolescents. The 
efficacy of cabozantinib in the intended later treatment line might be influenced by the type of prior 
systemic therapy used in RAI refractory adolescents.  
The final agreed indication is as follows (strike-through: text deleted): 
“CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 
years and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory 
or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.” 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data for the claimed indication is derived from the Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled pivotal Study XL184-311. The safety population included subjects that received at 
least one dose of study treatment. In addition, pooled safety data is also provided from previously 
reported studies (Studies XL184-309, XL184-308, and A031203) to set observations in Study XL184-
311 in context with prior cabozantinib safety experience. 
As described in the current Cabometyx SmPC, the most frequent adverse reactions of any grade 
(experienced by at least 25% of patients) during treatment of currently approved indications (renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) and hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC)) included diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, decreased 
appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), hypertension, weight decreased, 
vomiting, dysgeusia, constipation, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased.  
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the RCC population (≥1% incidence) are 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, hypertension, embolism, hyponatraemia, pulmonary embolism, 
vomiting, dehydration, fatigue, asthenia, decreased appetite, deep vein thrombosis, dizziness, 
hypomagnesaemia and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES). 
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the HCC population (≥1% incidence) are hepatic 
encephalopathy, asthenia, fatigue, PPES, diarrhoea, hyponatraemia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
thrombocytopenia.

Safety data presented in this report are mainly derived from study XL184-311, a randomized, placebo-
controlled, Phase 3 Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib 60 mg (tablet formulation) 
in subjects with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and who have 
progressed following vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy.  
The Safety Data Analysis Set in study XL184-311 was defined for subjects that received at least one 
dose of study treatment. All randomized subjects received their assigned study treatment; therefore, 
the ITT population and Safety population in this study are the same. There were 125 subjects in the 
XL184-311 cabozantinib arm at the assigned 60 mg qd dose as of the 19 August 2020 cutoff date, and 
for comparison, 62 subjects in the placebo arm. No additional safety data was submitted with the 
updated analysis of PFS and OS (median follow up 10.1 months, n= 258). The MAH includes children 
≥12 years in the indication, but only adult patients (≥18 years) were included in the pivotal study. 
Study XL184-311 is the focus of this submission. However, in addition, pooled safety data is also 
provided from previously reported studies so that the observations in Study XL184-311 will be set in 
context with prior cabozantinib safety experience.  
Patient exposure 
In Study XL184-311, a total of 187 subjects received study treatment: 125 subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm and 62 subjects in the placebo arm. 19 subjects crossed over from the placebo arm 
to receive cabozantinib in the crossover phase (data from the crossover period is summarized 
independently). 
Median duration of exposure (including dose interruptions) was almost twice as long in the 
cabozantinib arm (60 mg) compared with the placebo arm (4.4 months vs 2.3 months). Median dose 
intensity of cabozantinib was 70%, corresponding to a median daily dose of 42 mg. In the placebo

group, the median dose intensity was 90 %, and the median daily dose was 60 mg. Drug exposure is 
summarized in Table 36.

Duration of exposure = (date of decision to discontinue study treatment – date of first dose + 1)/30.4375. For 
subjects still on study, the data cutoff date was used to calculate the exposure. 
Average daily dose of cabozantinib (placebo) = total doses received (mg)/duration of exposure (days). 
An average dose > 60 mg was recorded for two placebo subjects (7028-3081 and 9503-3034) who crossed over 
to receive open-label study treatment due to inconsistencies in recording dates of end of blinded treatment and 
start of open-label treatment. In each case subjects received a maximum dose of 60 mg. 
Percent dose intensity of cabozantinib (placebo) = 100 × (average daily dose mg/day)/(60 mg/day). 
Duration of treatment = (date of decision to discontinue study treatment - date of first dose - total duration of 
dose interruptions + 1)/30.4375. 
A total of 72 subjects in the Safety population discontinued blinded study treatment as of the data 
cutoff date: 36 subjects (29%) in the cabozantinib arm and 36 subjects (58%) in the placebo arm. 
There was a low rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs related to study treatment in each 
treatment arm (cabozantinib 4%, placebo 0%). This is further discussed below. 
Dose modifications 
In Study XL184-311, if a subject experienced an unacceptable study treatment-related AE, it was 
managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity. If this proved ineffective, dose 
reductions or interruptions were to be considered to prevent worsening of toxicity. Following a dose 
Assessment report

Page 116/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interruption, the subject could resume treatment if the AE resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline values 
within 8 weeks. Study treatment could be started at a reduced dose to avoid worsening AEs, if the AE 
was related to treatment, or dose reduction was otherwise deemed clinically necessary. Study-
permitted dose levels for cabozantinib and cabozantinib-matched placebo are defined in Table 37.  
Dose re-escalation was not permitted for a drug-related dose reduction triggered by Grade 4 AEs 
affecting major organs (eg, central nervous system, cardiac, hepatic, renal). Subjects unable to 
tolerate a dose of 20 mg had study treatment discontinued.

Adverse events  
In Study XL184-311, a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any event that 
began or worsened on or after date of first dose of study treatment. For brevity, “TEAE” is hereafter 
referred to as “AE.” For the purpose of data collection, all AEs that occurred after informed consent 
through the end of the study observation period or until a subject was determined to be a screening 
failure, were to be recorded by the investigational site. This requirement included AEs from 
unscheduled as well as scheduled visits. AEs reported in the placebo arm occurred during the blinded 
study period. Abnormal laboratory values, ECG findings, or vital signs that were considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator were to be recorded as AEs. 
The safety observation period for subjects randomized to and receiving any cabozantinib was defined 
as the time between the date of first dose of cabozantinib to the earlier of the date of last dose of 
cabozantinib +30 days, date of withdrawal of consent by subject, date of death, or date of data cutoff. 
Clinic visits occurred at minimum every 2 weeks after treatment was initiated through Week 9, and 
then every 4 weeks through a 30-day post-treatment follow-up visit with contact every 12 weeks 
thereafter to assess survival status and to document receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy.  
Adverse events were coded per the MedDRA version 23.0. Adverse events were graded by the 
Investigator per CTCAE v5. For the purposes of this report, treatment-related AEs were defined as 
those assigned as “related” to study treatment by the Investigator. 
The safety population of cabozantinib excludes subjects in the placebo arm who crossed over to 
receive cabozantinib. For subjects who crossed over from placebo to cabozantinib, only the safety data 
from the time on placebo is summarized in the safety population data. Safety data from the crossover 
population is discussed in a separate section below.

Subjects are counted only once in each category but may be counted in multiple categories. 
Events are recorded with onset date through the end of the safety observation period unless otherwise stated 
(ie, “at any time”). 
For each treatment arm the frequency and percentage of subjects with AEs were tabulated by worst CTCAE 
grade for overall incidence by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) or only by PT. 
Adverse events that occurred at a ≥ 10% higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared with the

Safety Observations in the Crossover Phase of Study XL184-311 
Subjects randomized to the placebo arm were permitted to crossover to receive cabozantinib upon 
experiencing radiographic progressive disease, as determined by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 and 
confirmed by BIRC. As of the data cutoff, 19 subjects crossed over from the placebo arm to receive 
cabozantinib in the crossover phase of Study. Two placebo subjects did not begin open-label 
cabozantinib until after the data cutoff date. Safety observations in the crossover phase of Study 
XL184-311 were similar to the cabozantinib-only arm and are summarized below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 123/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median duration of cabozantinib exposure (including dose holds) in the crossover phase was 2.3 
(range 0.1 - 6.0) months. The median daily dose was 38.5 mg cabozantinib, and the corresponding 
median dose intensity was 64.2%. Safety observations in the crossover phase of Study XL184-311 
were similar to the cabozantinib-only arm (Table 44). 
A total of 4 crossover subjects (21%) died as of the 19 August 2020 data cutoff date. All deaths 
occurred ≤ 30 days after last dose of study treatment. Three deaths were assessed by the Investigator 
as causally associated with DTC. One subject had a death reported by the Investigator as other than 
causally associated with DTC; the associated Grade 5 AE PT was suspected COVID-19.

Comparison of Safety in Study XL184-311 with Pooled Studies (Studies XL184-309, XL184-
308, and A031203) 
Safety results from the 60-mg cabozantinib arm of Study XL184-311, pooled studies (cabozantinib 60-
mg treatment arms of Studies XL184-309, XL184-308, and A031203), and the 140-mg cabozantinib 
capsules arm of Study XL184-301 are provided to present the observations in the DTC population

(XL184-311) in context with respect to the broader cabozantinib safety experience. These studies were 
chosen on the basis that they led to the approval of cabozantinib for the treatment of RCC (Studies 
XL184-308 and A031203), HCC (Study XL184-309), and MTC (Study XL184-301). 
Cross-study comparison is limited due to differences in the study population, study design, intended 
dose and formulation, and time of follow-up. Furthermore, AE management guidance evolved over 
time with increasing familiarity with the safety profile of cabozantinib and TKIs in general. Overall, 
there were no additional safety concerns for Study XL184-311 compared with the other studies. The 
incidence of frequent AEs in Study XL184-311 was generally consistent with the other studies. 
A summary of frequent AEs (≥ 10% in the cabozantinib arm) of any grade in Study XL184 311, 
compared with the pooled studies and Study XL184-301, is presented in Table 45.

Two confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections were reported. Subject 8630-3165 in the cabozantinib arm was 
hospitalized due to Grade 3 COVID-19 and died ≥ 30 days after last dose of study treatment due to respiratory 
failure (cause of death was reported as COVID-19 infection). The subject presented with dyspnoea and was found 
to have ground glass opacities on CT scan. Subject 3401-3137 in the placebo arm had Grade 2 COVID-19 with 
symptoms of fever and cough. This subject recovered.

Deaths 
The incidence of deaths is summarized in Table 49 Survival information was collected on subjects 
during the safety observation period and at 12-week intervals thereafter until death (the precise date 
of death was recorded on the CRF).  
A total of 31 deaths were reported as of the cutoff date of 19 August 2020: 17 (14%) in the 
cabozantinib arm, 10 (16%) in the placebo arm, and 4 additional deaths in the placebo crossover arm. 
None of the deaths were considered related to study treatment, per Investigator.

(a)  Events to monitor (ETMs)  
Events to monitor (ETMs) represent medical events that reflect the known pharmacology of 
cabozantinib or other drugs in the same pharmacologic class or are otherwise considered important to 
characterizing the safety profile of cabozantinib. Incidence of ETMs is listed in Table 52 below. 
It is important to note that some ETMs contain a broad list of MedDRA PTs, and that the overall ETM 
incidences therefor should be interpreted with caution (eg, the ETM of QT prolongation contains many 
PTs, which medically could possibly be linked to QT prolongation but may not have been associated 
with a documented QT-prolongation).  
The most frequently observed ETMs (≥ 10% in cabozantinib arm) were diarrhoea, PPE, hypertension, 
proteinuria and VTEs. Among them, the more frequently (≥ 5% in cabozantinib) observed ETMs with 
Grade 3 events were PPE, hypertension, and diarrhoea. ETMs with Grade 3 or higher events occurring 
at rates between 2 and 5% (in any treatment arm) were VTEs, haemorrhage, and events possibly 
linked to QT prolongation. 
A total of 2 subjects (1.6%) in the cabozantinib arm experienced a PT of QT prolongation on study. 
Both events were Grade ≤ 2 and neither QTcF was > 500 ms (one subject had post baseline ECG 
assessments that showed prolonged QTcF interval (QTcF > 500 ms) per Investigator evaluation. The 
case was submitted for central review, and the QTcF elevation > 500 ms was not confirmed). No PT of 
QT prolonged was reported in the placebo arm. There were no events of torsades de pointes and no 
events of sudden death on either treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 130/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grade 5 ETMs had low rates across treatment arms and consisted of different isolated events within 
each treatment arm. In the cabozantinib arm, four Grade 5 events were reported: arterial 
haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, and cardio-respiratory arrest (1 subject each). All 
were assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator.

The Week 9 ECG was performed 1 day after the event of syncope. 
The ETMs in Study XL184-311 are compared with the pooled studies and Study XL184-301 in Table 
53. It is important to note, that over time, the ETM category definitions were refined, with more broad 
criteria implemented for Study XL184-311. Hence, cross-study comparison must be done with caution.  
There was a higher incidence of proteinuria in Study XL184-311 compared to the pooled studies and 
Study XL184-301. Of the cases of proteinuria, all but one of the subjects had proteinuria of Grade 1 or 
2 severity, and all events were non-serious. There was also a slightly higher incidence of venous and 
mixed/unspecified thrombotic events in Study XL184-311 compared to the pooled studies and Study 
XL184-301. Of the 12 subjects in the cabozantinib arm who experienced an ETM of VTE, 7 subjects had 
events that were Grade 1 or 2 of severity including 2 subjects with pulmonary embolism that was 
considered an incidental finding and was assigned a Grade < 3 by the Investigator. 1 subject 
experienced a Grade 5 suspected pulmonary embolism 1 day after discontinuing study treatment.

Laboratory findings 
Cabozantinib has previously been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities

Serum Chemistry 
Treatment-emergent abnormalities of selected serum chemistry parameters in Study XL184-311 are 
summarized in Table 57. Most of the treatment-emergent chemistry abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 
2 severity in both treatment arms. 
Serum chemistry abnormalities (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% higher per-subject incidence in the 
cabozantinib arm compared with placebo by decreasing frequency were AST increased, LDH increased, 
ALT increased, calcium corrected decreased, magnesium decreased, ALP increased, potassium 
decreased, albumin decreased, total bilirubin increased, potassium increased, glucose decreased, 
sodium decreased, and GGT increased. 
The serum chemistry parameters with the highest incidence (≥ 10%) of shifts from baseline of at least 
2 grades (worsening) in the cabozantinib arm comprised calcium corrected decreased (and LDH 
increased There were no parameters in the placebo arm that met the same criteria.

Laboratory results from both central and local laboratories were included. 
Sponsor-defined grades for LDH were as follows: Grade 1 (> ULN to ≤ 2 × ULN), Grade 2 (> 2 × ULN to ≤ 3 × 
ULN), Grade 3 (> 3 × ULN) 
Screening for Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
In Study XL184-311, blinded laboratory data listings were screened and reviewed by the Sponsor 
quarterly for potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as identified by ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
levels meeting Hy’s Law criteria (FDA Drug-Induced Liver Injury 2009). 
There were no cases of potential DILI based on the laboratory parameters described above reported in 
this study. 
Screening for Renal Dysfunction 
In Study XL184-311, the potential for study treatment to induce renal failure was assessed by the 
routine evaluation of subjects who met sponsor-defined laboratory screening criteria indicating risk of

renal dysfunction, and by the incidence of AEs and SAEs related to renal failure. Subjects were 
screened for possible treatment-emergent renal toxicity due to study treatment using three criteria: 
(1) 
Serum creatinine ≥ 3 ×  ULN and ≥ 2 ×  baseline value, OR 
(2) 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 AND ≥ 25% reduction from 
baseline, OR 
(3) 
eGFR ≤ 50% baseline value 
A total of 2 subjects (1.6%) in the cabozantinib arm met the screening criteria for potential drug 
related renal dysfunction compared with none in the placebo arm. Of the 2 subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm who met at least one of these qualifying criteria, none were determined to have cabozantinib 
induced renal toxicity. 
Haematology 
Treatment-emergent abnormalities of selected haematology parameters in Study XL184-311 are 
summarized in Table 58. Most of the treatment-emergent haematology abnormalities were of Grade 1

Laboratory results were graded per sponsor-defined criteria (see Section 2.7.4.Error! Reference source not 
found. for further details).  
For each laboratory abnormality, subjects are summarized at the worst value reported after first dose. Laboratory 
results from both central and local laboratories are included.  
Denominators for percentages are N, the total number of subjects in each treatment arm. 
Thyroid Function 
For inclusion in Study XL184-311, subjects were required to be receiving thyroid replacement therapy 
and have TSH levels below the lower cutoff of the reference range or less than 0.50 mIU/L (< 0.50 
μIU/mL), whichever was lower. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the impact of cabozantinib 
treatment on thyroid function parameters.  
Hypothyroidism was reported as an AE for 2.4% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 0% of 
subjects in the placebo arm. All events in the cabozantinib arm were Grade 1 or 2. 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety of cabozantinib in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has not yet been established. 
No data are available in the intended population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies have been carried out in vitro, and in the clinic, and were part of the 
original Cabometyx filing. No further drug interaction studies have been conducted, knowledge to date 
is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 18 subjects (14.4%) in the cabozantinib arm and 7 subjects (5.6%) in the placebo arm 
discontinued blinded treatment due to an AE, whatever the causal relationship and including those 
reported as related to disease progression or clinical deterioration. The rate of treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs related to study treatment was 4 % for the cabozantinib arm and 0% for 
the placebo arm. The overall incidence of study treatment discontinuation due to an AE regardless of 
causality (excluding AEs related to disease under study) was 6 subjects (4.8%) in the cabozantinib 
arm and none in the placebo arm. The only AE that led to study treatment discontinuation (not related 
to disease under study) in ≥ 1% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm was fatigue (1.6% of subjects). 
Post marketing experience 
Cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) were approved for the treatment of patients with progressive, 
metastatic MTC at a dose of 140 mg qd and for the treatment of adults with progressive, unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Cabozantinib tablets (Cabometyx) have also been approved for 
the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC and adult patients with HCC. Cabozantinib tablets 
are also approved in the US and EU for adult patients with advanced RCC. Through 28 November 
2020, the estimated number of patients treated with cabozantinib exceeds 60,000 patients in the post 
marketing setting, including approximately 3,800 treated with Cometriq. 
Cumulative data from a combined 96 paediatric patients exposed to cabozantinib in the post marketing 
setting suggest that the safety profile in the paediatric population does not differ significantly from that 
observed with adults. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data for the claimed indication is derived from the Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled pivotal Study XL184-311. The safety population included subjects that received at 
least one dose of study treatment. In addition, pooled safety data is also provided from previously 
reported studies (Studies XL184-309, XL184-308, and A031203) to set observations in Study XL184-
311 in the context of prior cabozantinib safety experience. 
Patient Exposure 
At total of 187 subjects were included in the safety population, 125 in the cabozantinib arm, and 62 in 
the placebo arm. The size of the defined safety population is sufficient to detect common AEs. 
However, the safety population size is not sufficient to detect potential rare adverse events. Median 
duration of exposure was 4.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 2.3 months in the placebo arm. 4.4 
months is a limited amount of time, which does not enable detection of potential long-term adverse 
events or AEs with a long lag time. Dose modifications (reductions and interruptions) due to an AE 
occurred at a higher frequency in the cabozantinib arm compared to placebo (78% vs 27%), but to a 
similar extent as in previous studies of RCC and HCC. Median daily dose of cabozantinib was 42 mg, 
which is comparable to the median daily dose in the studies of RCC and HCC. 
No paediatric patients were exposed to the drug in the pivotal study.  
Adverse Events 
Overall, the types of AEs reported are consistent with previous observations for cabozantinib and there 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 141/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were no new safety signals identified. The overall incidence of AEs in the cabozantinib arm and the 
placebo arm was 94% vs 84%, respectively. The incidence of treatment-related AEs was higher in the 
cabozantinib arm (90%) compared to the placebo arm (52%). The most frequent AEs (reported for ≥ 
20% of subjects) in the cabozantinib arm were diarrhoea, PPE, hypertension, fatigue, ALT increased, 
nausea, AST increased, decreased appetite, and hypocalcaemia. These AEs were also reported at ≥ 
20% incidence in the pooled studies, except for hypocalcaemia (23% in Study XL184-311 vs 6% in the 
pooled studies). Another AE which was more frequently reported in the DTC population, cabozantinib 
arm, was proteinuria (15% in Study XL184-311 vs 7% in the pooled studies). The most frequently 
reported AEs leading to dose reduction corresponded to the frequently reported AEs overall.  
Hypocalcaemia is a known frequent complication in patients undergoing thyroid surgery and was hence 
expected to occur at a higher incidence in DTC and MTC, than in the pooled studies in patients with 
RCC and HCC. However, it should be noted that the incidence was markedly higher in the cabozantinib 
arm compared to the placebo arm (23% vs 1.6%) in the DTC population, indicating a potential relation 
to treatment. No case of hypocalcaemia led to severe clinical consequences, and they were managed 
with calcium supplementation and/or cabozantinib dose modification. Hypocalcaemia is mentioned in 
the SmPC section 4.4 among biochemical parameters to monitor during cabozantinib treatment.  
Of the proteinuria events, all but one of the subjects had proteinuria of Grade 1 or 2 severity, and all 
events were non-serious. Proteinuria is listed as an ETM, regular monitoring of urine protein is 
recommended in the Cabometyx SmPC section 4.4, and proteinuria is listed as a common AE. Blockage 
of the VEGF pathway is known to contribute to proteinuria. However, there is no explanation for the 
difference in frequency of proteinuria in study XL184-311, compared to previous studies. The MAH 
discussed several plausible reasons for the differences in hypocalcaemia, which are acknowledged.  An 
update to the existing warning in the EU SmPC regarding electrolytes with the proposed additional 
wording: “Hypocalcaemia has been observed with cabozantinib at a higher frequency and/or increased 
severity (including grade 3 and 4) in patients with thyroid cancer compared to patients with other 
cancers” is granted.  
Grade 3/4 events were reported for 57% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 26% in the placebo 
arm. Grade 3/4 AEs that had a ≥ 2% higher per-subject incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared 
with placebo by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were PPE, fatigue, diarrhoea, 
hypertension, hypocalcaemia, decreased appetite, nausea, asthenia, mucosal inflammation, pulmonary 
embolism, and stomatitis. 
SAEs 
The overall incidence of SAEs was 34% in the cabozantinib arm and 29% in the placebo arm (16% vs 
1.6% related to study treatment, respectively). SAEs reported for ≥ 2% of subjects in the cabozantinib 
arm were diarrhoea, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and dyspnoea. Pleural effusion and 
dyspnoea were also reported for ≥ 2% of subjects in the placebo arm. Treatment related SAEs with a 
≥ 1% incidence in the cabozantinib arm were deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, and pulmonary 
embolism; all included in the ETMs. 
There were no new SAEs in Study XL184-311, compared to previous studies in other indications. 
Deaths 
A total of 31 deaths were reported in the study, 14% in the cabozantinib arm and 16% in the placebo 
arm. None of the deaths were considered related to study treatment, per Investigator. 
Through 30 days after last dose of study treatment, 4 of 9 subjects in the cabozantinib arm 
experienced a Grade 5 AE of disease progression or thyroid cancer. The other Grade 5 AEs reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 142/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were arterial haemorrhage, cardiac arrest, cardio-respiratory arrest, pulmonary embolism, and 
pneumonia (1 subject each). 
Events to Monitor 
Most ETMs occurred at a higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared to the placebo arm. As 
discussed above, there was a higher incidence of proteinuria in study XL184-311, compared to 
previous studies. However, when looking at individual studies the incidence of proteinuria was not 
higher in DTC compared to other indications and there is hence no further concern. The incidence of 
VTEs was slightly higher than in previous studies. This might be explained by the fact that the ETM of 
VTE was based on different PTs in the different studies. Thrombosis is mentioned in the SmPC section 
4.4. The time to first occurrence varies among the ETMs (range from 15-330 days). Hence, the 
exposure time (4.4 months (range 0.0, 15.7) might not enable detection of ETMs appearing with a 
long lag time. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum chemistry abnormalities (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm were AST increased, LDH increased, ALT increased, calcium corrected 
decreased, magnesium decreased, ALP increased, potassium decreased, albumin decreased, total 
bilirubin increased, potassium increased, glucose decreased, sodium decreased, and GGT increased. It 
is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of 
cabozantinib treatment and to monitor closely during treatment, as stated in SmPC section 4.4.  
LDH increased 90% in the cabozantinib arm vs 32% in the placebo arm. LDH increase adverse events 
(AEs) have been consistently reported across cabozantinib monotherapy studies, with a similar 
frequency in thyroid cancer studies (6.7% in the XL184-311DTC study and 8.9% in the XL184-401 
MTC study) and a non-thyroid cancer study (7.3% in the XL184-308 RCC study). When considering 
laboratory data, LDH increase abnormalities were consistently and similarly increased across 
cabozantinib 60 mg monotherapy studies (90% in XL184-311, 88% in XL184-401 and 84% in XL184-
309). LDH increase in cabozantinib studies is not evocative of an increased frequency in DTC compared 
to other cancersand hence no need for adding LDH as an ADR.  
No subjects in the study met Hy’s Law screening criteria or additional screening criteria for potential 
DILI. A total of 2 subjects in the cabozantinib arm and none in the placebo arm met the screening 
criteria for potential drug-related renal dysfunction. Haematology abnormalities (all grades) that had a 
≥ 5% higher per-subject incidence in the cabozantinib arm compared with placebo were leukocytes 
decreased, neutrophils decreased, and platelets decreased. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No paediatric patients were included in the pivotal study. A summary of clinical paediatric data and 
post-marketing paediatric data were provided. Available paediatric safety data come from three clinical 
trials (Study ADVL1211, Study ADVL1622, The CABONE study) and from post-marketing safety data 
from the global cabozantinib database. The robustness of the submitted data does not allow for a 
proper assessment, since the clinical data comprises (a) a phase I study with 39 paediatric patients 
(previously assessed for Cometriq), (b) an ongoing phase II study with 71 paediatric patients, CSR 
expected in Q2 2022, and (c) a phase II study with 8 paediatric patients, and the post-marketing data 
includes around 100 patients, of which 11 with thyroid cancer (type not specified).  
Hence, the possibility of new safety concerns cannot be ruled out. TKIs have been shown to impact 
growth in paediatric patients and the effect of cabozantinib on longitudinal growth is still under 
investigation. It is also of note that the provided paediatric data mostly includes patients with other

tumour types than thyroid cancer (n=7 with MTC in the three above mentioned clinical trials), and the 
relevance of these data for assessment of cabozantinib in DTC remains uncertain.   
Post marketing data for cabozantinib are subject to continued pharmacovigilance monitoring and are 
reported as per applicable post-marketing safety reporting requirements, individually as expedited 
reports as well as periodically in aggregate reports to global health authorities. Through 28 November 
2020, the reviewed post marketing safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of 
cabozantinib and confirms the clinical trial safety data for cabozantinib. The safety profile of 
cabozantinib in the post marketing setting remains favourable and similar to the profile established 
during clinical trials 
The MAH confirmed that the safety profile in the paediatric population will be closely monitored and 
discussed in the PSUSA.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety of cabozantinib in DTC in adults is generally consistent with the known safety 
profile. Overall, the safety profile of cabozantinib in DTC appears manageable with dose modifications, 
and no major safety concerns are raised for the adult population.  
Regarding the safety profile in the paediatric population, the robustness of the submitted data does not 
allow a proper assessment and thus, the possibility of new safety concerns cannot be ruled out. In 
addition, the provided paediatric data mostly includes patients with other tumour types than thyroid 
cancer and the relevance of these data for assessment of cabozantinib in DTC remains uncertain. Thus, 
in conclusion, it is still unclear whether the safety profile of cabozantinib in adolescents is similar to 
that in adults with DTC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The design, layout and format of the package leaflet is continued. There are minor changes in relate 
the safety profile to include the safety profile in DTC. However, the current writing style has been 
respected. The evidence from user testing previously performed on the CABOMETYX leaflet is 
considered relevant and applicable to this application. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
At this stage, no additional pharmacovigilance measures have been proposed. No additional monitoring 
is requested.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final approved indication is “CABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory or not 
eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Surgical resection by either total thyroidectomy or unilateral lobectomy, with or without lymph node 
removal, is the main treatment. TSH suppression is recommended for all patients with persistent 
structural disease in the absence of specific contraindications. DTC is usually a slow-growing disease, 
even if the patients develop distant metastasis. Radioactive iodine (I-131) (RAI) is the standard initial 
therapy for recurrent or metastatic DTC. For patients becoming refractory to RAI, the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) sorafenib and lenvatinib is a standard option when local treatments (e.g., palliative 
surgery, radiofrequency ablation, external beam radiation therapy) have been exhausted and the 
disease is progressive or symptomatic.  
Treatment options are very limited for patients developing resistance to TKI therapy. For adult patients 
diagnosed with advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer the RET inhibitor selpercatinib is recently 
approved in the EU. In addition, for patients with solid tumours expressing NTRK gene fusion, 
larotrectinib and entrectinib might be an option (approved in the EU for adults in addition to paediatric 
patients and in patients from the age of 12, respectively). However, these new drugs cover only 
specific molecular subtypes of DTCs and, overall, more effective therapies for RAI refractory DTC are 
thus still needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase III multicentre, randomised (2:1), double-
blind, placebo-controlled study comparing cabozantinib in adult patients with metastatic DTC who were 
refractory to or deemed ineligible for treatment with Iodine-131, had previously received up to 
maximum two regimens of VEGFR-targeted therapy, whereof one of them had to be either sorafenib or 
lenvatinib, and had demonstrated disease progression (documented radiographic PD per Investigator 
per RECIST 1.1) on the last therapy. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤65 years vs. > 65 years) 
and prior receipt of lenvatinib (yes or no). Multiple primary endpoints in the XL184-311 study were PFS 
and ORR. Crossover to cabozantinib was optional for subjects initially randomised to placebo upon 
experiencing radiographic disease progression as confirmed by BIRC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The prespecified primary interim PFS analysis (data cut-off 19 August 2020) for the ITT population 
(N=187, whereof 125 in the cabozantinib arm and 62 in the placebo arm, median follow-up 6.24 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 149/154 
 
 
 
 
 
months) showed a statistically significant benefit in PFS for cabozantinib over placebo (HR = 0.22, 
96% CI [stratified]: 0.13, 0.36; observed p-value [stratified log-rank test] <0.0001). Median PFS in 
the cabozantinib arm was not reached (96% CI: 5.7, NE) vs. 1.9 (96% CI: 1.8, 3.6) months in the 
placebo arm in this analysis. 
The updated PFS analysis, (data cut-off 08 February 2021) for the Full ITT population, (N=258, 
whereof 170 in the cabozantinib arm and 88 in the placebo arm, median follow-up 10.1 months) 
showed a HR of 0.22, 96% CI (stratified): 0.15, 0.32; observed p-value (stratified log-rank test) 
<0.0001. The median PFS (cabozantinib vs. placebo) was 11.0 (96% CI: 7.4, 13.8) vs. 1.9 (96% CI: 
1.9, 3.7) months. 
The results for the Primary Analysis Subset (i.e., the ITT population, but with a longer median follow-
up of 11.9 months) were in support of the results observed for the Full ITT population. 
Cabozantinib showed efficacy in PFS (HR<1 and 95% CI excluding 1) in the majority of subgroups, this 
includes the subgroups “receipt of prior lenvatinib or not”, “receipt of prior sorafenib or not” and 
“receipt of prior sorafenib and lenvatinib or not” (data cut-off 19 August 2020). The updated subgroup 
analyses (data cut-off 08 February 2021) were consistent with the analyses at the first cut-off date.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
PFS and ORR were defined as multiple primary endpoints, and study success was to be declared if at 
least one null hypothesis was rejected. ORR was 15% (99% CI: 5.8, 29.3) in the cabozantinib arm vs. 
0% (99% CI: 0.0, 14.8) in the placebo arm, however, ORR was not met as Study XL184-311 failed to 
reject the null hypothesis of ORR at the pre-specified alpha of 1% (observed unstratified Fisher exact 
test p-value= 0.0281).  
OS was not a controlled endpoint and at the time of progression patients in the placebo arm could 
cross over to the cabozantinib arm. Furthermore, OS data were immature with > 75% of events 
censored at the latest clinical cut-off (08 February 2021).  No further updates of the OS analysis are 
available or planned. Use of subsequent anticancer therapy post study will also be a confounding 
factor. However, it is noted, that despite crossover of patients from the placebo arm, no apparent 
detrimental effect on survival in the cabozantinib arm is currently observed. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the unfavourable effects of cabozantinib in the adult DTC trial population are consistent with 
the known safety profile of cabozantinib, although some differences were observed. The frequency of 
adverse events regardless of causality was 94% in the cabozantinib arm and 84% in the placebo arm. 
90% of the AEs in the cabozantinib arm were assessed as treatment-related, vs 52% in the placebo 
arm. 
The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% of subjects, all grades) were diarrhoea, PPE, hypertension, fatigue, ALT 
increased, nausea, AST increased, decreased appetite, and hypocalcaemia. In the cabozantinib arm, 
there was a higher incidence of hypocalcaemia compared to the pooled studies (23% vs 6%), and a 
higher incidence of proteinuria (15%), compared to the pooled studies (7%) and Study XL184-301 
(2%). The proportion of patients experiencing at least one grade 3/4 AEs was 57% in the cabozantinib 
arm, and 26% in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of treatment-related SAEs in the cabozantinib arm (16%) was generally consistent with 
previous studies. The most frequent treatment-related SAEs (≥ 1% incidence) in the cabozantinib arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/214682/2022 
Page 150/154 
 
 
 
 
of Study XL184-311 were diarrhoea (3.2% of subjects), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1.6%), 
hypertension (1.6%), and pulmonary embolism (1.6%) 
None of the deaths reported (n=31) were considered related to study treatment, per Investigator.  
Dose modifications (interruptions and reductions) due to an AE occurred at a higher frequency in the 
cabozantinib arm compared to placebo (78% vs 27%), but to a similar extent as in previous studies. 
The incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (not related to disease under study) was 
higher in the cabozantinib arm (4.8%) than in the placebo arm (0%).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results of the pivotal study provide clear evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS 
for cabozantinib compared to placebo in adult subjects with RAI refractory metastatic DTC who have 
progressed after treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib. The median PFS gain of ~ 9 months is of 
clinical relevance in this setting, although the estimate of median PFS of 11 months in the cabozantinib 
arm is uncertain taking into consideration the rather low number of patients left at risk at that time 
point. The PFS effect appears to be consistent in all the updated subgroup analyses performed.  
The observed ORR was rather low (15%), however as in the pivotal study, more subjects reached 
stable disease in the cabozantinib arm vs. placebo, there is a possible indication that the effect of 
cabozantinib might primarily be caused by disease stabilisation, rather than a decrease in tumour 
burden.  
Notwithstanding confounding of the OS analysis due to cross-over of placebo patients with progressive 
disease into the cabozantinib arm, there is positive initial signals in terms of OS improvement and no 
apparent detrimental effect on OS by cabozantinib.

Overall, adult patients with metastatic, progressive RAI refractory DTC have a relatively poor 
prognosis, with an estimated median survival time of 2.5-3.5 years. After progression on the TKIs 
lenvatinib or sorafenib, this patient population has few alternative treatment options. New therapies 
(selpercatinib, entrectinib, larotrectinib) are recently approved for treatment of tumours expressing 
specific gene fusions/rearrangements (RET and NTRK) and which is also relevant in thyroid cancers. 
However, for patients harbouring tumours without these specific molecular characteristics or for those 
who of other reasons are ineligible for treatment with these new agents, there is a need of new 
treatment alternatives which can improve the prognosis and increase the clinician’s therapeutic 
options. In this context, the observed efficacy of cabozantinib appears promising.  
The overall safety profile of cabozantinib in adult subjects with RAI-refractory DTC appears 
manageable with dose modifications and was consistent with the expected safety profile of the drug. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant benefit in terms of PFS is observed in adult patients belonging to a patient group 
with currently limited treatment options. The beneficial PFS effect is also noted across the majority of 
subgroups. Furthermore, no indication of detrimental effect in OS was observed in the cabozantinib 
arm.  
The overall safety profile of cabozantinib in adult subjects with RAI-refractory DTC appears 
manageable and was consistent with the expected safety profile of the drug. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cabometyx (cabozantinib) as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), refractory or not eligible to 
radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy is positive

iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy; as a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the local representative for Spain. Version 6.1 of the RMP 
has also been submitted. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cabometyx is not similar to Nexavar within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: This European Union Risk Management 
Plan (EU RMP) is updated to reflect the recent completion of the RIVAS study 
(BE29950) (Final study report dated 20 June 2023) and to close the respective post-
approval commitment. BE29950 is a retrospective, secondary data collection, long term 
surveillance, non-interventional (Category 3) study aimed at providing long-term safety 
data from the use of rituximab and other available therapies for patients with GPA
(granulomatosis with polyangiitis), or MPA (microscopic polyangiitis).
Based on the results from the BE29950 (RIVAS) study and in accordance with GVP 
module V, “Long term use in GPA/MPA patients (GPA/MPA only)” has been removed 
from the list of safety concerns as there are no clinical study report or additional PV 
activities. It is no longer considered as a “missing information” for the RMP.
In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity of this EU RMP update to make 
additional updates that do not have an impact on the summary of safety concerns of 
rituximab. These updates are detailed in the subsection ‘Summary of Significant 
changes in this RMP’.
Summary of Significant Changes in this RMP
 The following sections were updated to align with the GVP Guidance: Population-
Specific Considerations III: Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:
o Part II Module SI ‘Epidemiology of the indications and the target 
populations’ has been updated to include the latest epidemiology 
information specific to pregnancy and lactation.
o Part II Module SIV.3 ‘Limitations in respect to populations typically 
under-represented in clinical trial development programs has been 
updated with information specific to pregnancy and lactation. 
 Annex 7 ‘Other Supporting Data’ has been updated with cumulative (data lock 
point: 17 November 2022) and interval (PBRER 1117927 cover period: 
16 November 2021 to 17 November 2022) exposure in pregnant women and 
pregnancy outcomes. 
 Part II: Module SV and Annex 7– ‘Post-authorization experience’ was updated as 
per the most recent PBRER 1117927 with the DLP of 17 November 2022.
 Part II: Module SI.2 ‘Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis And Microscopic 
Polyangiitis’ has been updated with the EULAR 2022 recommendations.
 Part II: Module SVII.2 – ‘New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a 
Submission of an Updated RMP’ has been updated with rational for removing 
long term use in GPA/MPA patients (GPA/MPA only) from the list of safety 
concerns.

 Part III.1 Routine pharmacovigilance activities – has been updated as there is 
discontinuation of Internal Checklist for Administration Route Errors and 
information pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. The rationale for the 
discontinuation of the internal checklist is detailed in CO.
 Missing information “long term use in GPA/MPA patients” (GPA/MPA only) has 
been removed from Part II: Module SVIII – ‘Summary of the Safety Concerns’ 
and Part II: Module SVII 3.2 ‘Presentation of the Missing Information’.
 Part III.2 ‘Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities’ has been updated with the 
results from the BE29950 (RIVAS) study.
 Study BE29950 has been removed from Part III.3 “summary table of additional 
pharmacovigilance activities”.
 Part V.1 ‘Routine risk minimization measures’ and Part V.3 ‘Summary for risk 
minimization measures” includes the routine risk minimization measures for the 
ongoing list of safety concerns. Information corresponding to the routine risk 
minimization measures for “long term use in GPA/MPA patients (GPA/MPA only)” 
is removed from these two sections as it is no longer considered as “missing 
information”.
 BE29950 (RIVAS)– has been updated from ongoing to completed category 3 
study in annex 2 ‘Tabulated Summary of Planned, Ongoing and Completed 
Pharmacovigilance Study Programme’ and Annexure 3 ‘Protocols for Proposed, 
Ongoing and Completed Studies in the Pharmacovigilance Plan.

Centralised Procedure
Brief description of the product 
including: 
Chemical Class: chimeric mouse/human 
monoclonal antibody
Summary of mode of action: Rituximab binds 
specifically to the transmembrane antigen CD20. 
This antigen is located on pre-B- and mature 
B-lymphocytes, but not on hemopoietic stem cells, 
pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal 
cells. Following antibody binding, CD20 is not 
internalized or shed from the cell membrane into 
the environment. CD20 does not circulate in the 
plasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not 
compete for antibody binding.
Rituximab is believed to exert its therapeutic effect 
by promoting B-cell lysis. It binds to the CD20 
antigen on B-lymphocytes and initiates 
immunologic reactions that mediate B-cell lysis. 
Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
and induction of apoptosis.
The CD20 antigen is expressed on > 95% of all 
B-cell non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHL). In vitro 
studies have demonstrated that rituximab 
sensitizes drug-resistant human B-cell lymphoma 
lines to the cytotoxic effects of some 
chemotherapeutic agents.
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B-cells are thought to 
play a central role in the RA disease process 
through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
antigen presentation, and auto-antibody 
production.  Hence, selective depletion of 
CD20-positive B-cells (with rituximab) offers a 
rational approach to the treatment of RA.
Due to its specific mode of action, the use of

Hyperlink to the Product Information
Indication(s) in the EEA 
rituximab has also been explored in several other 
autoimmune disorders impacted by B-cell function, 
including GPA/MPA and PV.
Important information about its composition:
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric 
mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a 
glycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 
constant regions and murine light-chain and heavy-
chain variable region sequences. The antibody is 
produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster
ovary) cell suspension culture and purified by 
affinity chromatography and ion exchange, 
including specific viral inactivation and removal 
procedures.

TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Incidence: 
The incident rate is 45/100,000 person-years, in a population of 18 years and older; out 
of which 73% are female, 27% are male (Gabriel et al. 2003). 

Prevalence: 
Overall rheumatoid arthritis (RA) prevalence in industrialized countries is between 0.3% 
and 1% (Wolfe et al. 2003); 14/1,000 female, 7.4/1,000 male population 
(Gabriel et al. 2003), with the lifetime risk of RA in adults in the US being 3.6% (1 in 28) 
for women and 1.7% (1 in 59) for men (Crowson et al. 2011). The incidence and 
prevalence of RA increases with age. Pooled estimates of prevalence in European 
populations are as follows (males/females per 1,000): ages 5  14, 0/0.05; ages 15  44, 
1/6; ages 45  59, 5.3/12; ages 60 and over, 12/26 (Lau et al. 1996). Age and sex 
distribution is largely similar across American and European populations 
(AbdeI-Nasser et al. 1997).

Demographics: 
New-onset RA occurs in a wide range of ages, the majority of patients are females with 
a rate of approximately 3:1(Lau et al. 1996; AbdeI-Nasser et al. 1997). Rheumatoid 
Arthritis patients in the United Kingdom(UK), who began using biological therapy 
(anti-TNF), had a mean age of 56 years, younger than patients on non-biological 
Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy (mean 60 years) 
(Dixon et al. 2006). Standard deviation of the age in these groups was 12 and 13 years, 
respectively, showing that patients in a wide age range are treated with biologic and 
non-biologic DMARD therapies.
 Main existing treatment options: 
Recommendations for the management of RA have been developed by major 
professional organizations, including the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and 
the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).  These guidelines recommend 
that patients diagnosed with RA should be started on disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drug (DMARD) therapy as soon as possible following diagnosis, and that treatment 
should be aimed at reaching a target of sustained remission or low disease activity. 
There are a number of efficacious DMARDs, including conventional synthetic DMARDs 
(methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine), biological DMARDs (TNF inhibitors, IL-6 
inhibitor, abatacept, rituximab) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (Jak inhibitors). 
EULAR guidelines recommend treatment start with a conventional DMARD, with 
methoxtrexate being part of the first treatment strategy, in combination with short-term 
glucocorticoids if necessary. For patients responding insufficiently to methotrexate with 
poor prognostic factors, or who respond insufficiently to a combination of conventional 
DMARDs, biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs are treatment options.


Risk factors for the disease:  
Gender-specific, genetic and environmental risk factors for RA have been identified:
o Female sex: Women are two to three times more likely to develop RA than 
men. Gender-specific factors affecting the susceptibility remain incompletely 
understood, maybe due to stimulatory effects of estrogen on the immune system. 
Various reproductive factors may contribute to the cause of RA, it has been 
observed that the risk of RA is increased by nulliparity, and pregnancy is often 
associated with disease remission in the last trimester (Gabriel et al. 2017, 
Crowson CS, et al. 2011, Ansar Ahmed et al. 1985).
o Genetic risk factors: Twin and sibling studies implicate genetic factors in the 
susceptibility for RA, and there is a significant overlap with genes identified as 
risk factors for other autoimmune diseases. A number of genes and genetic 
makers have been identified, with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) being the 
major genetic susceptibility factor (Gabriel et al. 2017,  Jawaheer D et al. 2001, 
de Vries N et al. 2002).
o Environmental risk factors are smoking and obesity. Multiple studies show that 
cigarette smoking increases a person’s risk of developing RA and for greater 
disease severity. Studies examining the role of obesity also found that the more 
overweight a person was, the higher his or her risk of developing RA became 
(Gabriel et al. 2017, Liao KP et al. 2009).

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population: 
Mortality: In RA populations, elevated Standardized Mortality Rates (SMR) of 1.23  2.03 
were reported (Gabriel et al. 2003, Young et al. 2007, Björnadal et al. 2002, Kapetanovic 
et al. 2011c, Kim et al. 2012). Coronary artery disease is a major cause of death in RA, 
SMR 1.79 (Björnadal et al. 2002). RA patients, compared to the general population, 
have elevated all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates [Dixon et al. 2006, Young et 
al. 2007]. Early functional disability [Farragher et al. 2007] and persistent inflammatory 
state (inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive 
protein, were found to be predictors of CV death [Symmons et al.2006, Maradit-Kremers 
et al. 2005).
Morbidity: Decreased life expectancy is usually due to morbidity associated with RA 
such as CV disease, or to iatrogenic effects of therapy, in particular infections and 
gastrointestinal bleeding related to long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs 
(Dixon et al. 2006).
Outcome of the (untreated) target disease: Destruction of joint capsules, tendons and 
ligaments lead to deformed joints that have restricted range of motion. Extra-articular 
manifestations of RA may affect major organ systems.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes: RA has consistently been associated with increased risks 
of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with the general population, especially 
preterm birth, cesarean sections and delivery of children small for gestational age. A 
study in the US (2003- 2011) reported that women diagnosed with RA had higher rates 
of obstetric complications than did the control group. The rates of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes compared to matched control reported were premature rupture of membranes

(PROM) (5.4% vs 3.4%), antepartum hemorrhage (3% vs 2%), preterm delivery (10.2%
vs 6.6%), and cesarean section (35% vs 28%) (Kishore et al. 2019). The  rates of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes in RA women compared to matched cohort in  a study 
from Canada (2004-2013) were gestational hypertension (4.12% vs 3.25%),  pre-
eclampsia (6.8% vs 4.1%), PROM (16.28% vs 9.9%), postpartum hemorrhage  (3.11% 
vs 2.9%), small for gestational age (4.6% vs 2.1%), congenital anomalies  (1.02% vs 
<1%), intrauterine fetal deaths (<1% vs <1%) and preterm births (12.2%  vs 7.2%) 
(Aljary et al. 2020).

Important co-morbidities: 
As RA is associated with inflammation and changes of immunity, various co-morbidities 
may be present. Several organ systems may be affected, such as the skin (vasculitis, 
rheumatoid nodules), eye (episcleritis), pulmonary (interstitial pneumonia), neurological, 
musculoskeletal (e.g., osteoporosis) and hematological (anemia) (Wasko et al. 2004, 
Robbins et al. 2005). Occurrence of cardiovascular disease, malignant events, and 
infections are especially important. 
RA patients have an increased risk of 30%-60% for CV disease (Watson et al. 2003), 
elevated RR of 1.76-2.00 for MI (Turesson et al. 2004; Solomon et al. 2003), elevated 
risk of 1.41 (95% CI 1.31-1.51) for atrial fibrillation (Lindhardsen et al. 2012) and 
elevated RR of 1.32-1.48 for stroke (Solomon et al. 2003 ; Solomon et al. 2006; Watson 
et al. 2003; Lindhardsen et al. 2012).
RA patients remain at increased risk for overall malignancy with standardized incidence 
ratios (SIR) of 1.20, having a higher risk of lymphoma (SIR 2.60), lung cancer (SIR 
1.66), and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (SIR 1.72-1.83) (Smitten et al. 2008b; 
Simon et al. 2014; Mercer et al. 2012). The risk of lymphoma is directly related to the 
degree and duration of inflammation in RA (Baecklund et al. 2006). Increased RR were 
reported for RA patients on TNF inhibitors: RR 1.37-2.02 - for NMSC (Lopez-Olivo et al.
2012, Askling et al. 2011), 1.08 - for skin cancer, 2.14 - for lymphoma, and 1.13 for solid 
tumors (Lopez-Olivo et al. 2012). 
Patients with advanced RA are at a higher risk of infection than the general population, 
largely because of altered immunological function, other disease-related factors such as 
decreased mobility, and therapies used to treat the underlying disease (steroids, 
immunomodulating agents). Compared to non-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) group, the 
hazard ratio (HR) was 1.70 for incident objectively confirmed infection 
(Doran et al. 2002). Treatment with anti-TNF-α agents appears to increase the risk of 
infection, especially during the initial phase of therapy Curtis et al. (2007) and Askling et 
al (2007).

SI.2 GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS AND MICROSCOPIC 
POLYANGIITIS
Incidence: 

Adult Patients
The overall incidence rate of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody Associated Vasculitis
(AAV) in Europe is between 13 and 20 per million population per year.  The incidence 
rate of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) in the EU ranges from 0.7 to 11.9 per 
million population and the incidence rate of Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) in the EU 
ranges from 0.5 to 13.4 per million population (Watts et al. 2015).  The incidence rate of 
GPA in the UK has been calculated to be 11.8 (95% CI: 10.7, 12.9) per million 
person-years, as assessed in a study  using 462 cases diagnosed between 1997 and 
2013 (Pearce 2017). 
There are geographic differences in the incidence of GPA/MPA in Europe with GPA 
being more common in Northern Europe and MPA being more common in Southern 
Europe (Ntatsaki, 2010, Watts, 2001). There are also age differences in Europe with 
GPA being most prevalent in younger patients (i.e. <65 years old) than in older patients 
in Southern Greece (Panagiotakis et al. 2009). A study from a mixed-ethnicity population 
from the UK indicates that the incidence rates of GPA and MPA were 8.2 per million 
(95% CI: 5.8, 11.3) and 13.4 per million (95% CI: 10.3, 17.2), respectively 
(Pearce et al. 2016), and that across all types of AAV there were no statistically 
significant racial/ethnic differences (incidence rate ratio 0.7, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.5, p0.3).
Pediatric Patients
Among the population aged <18 years, there is limited data on the incidence of GPA and 
MPA. 
The mean incidence of GPA in this population was 1.2 per million (Watts et al. 2012,
study period: 1988-2010 and Gardner-Medwin et.al 2002, study period 1996-1999) in the 
UK ().  The annual incidence in Poland and Sweden was 1.0 (2004-2010) and 1.4 
(2004-2014) per million respectively (Kanecki et al. 2014, Mossberg et al. 2018).  The 
mean incidence of MPA across age group <18 years was 1.0 per million
(Watts et al. 2012) in the UK (study period: 1988-2010), while the annual incidence in 
Sweden was 1.4 (Mossberg et al. 2018) per million (study period: 2004-2014).  Seven 
publications on the pediatric population (five were from Europe) from 2000-2018 were 
identified (search terms in Embase.com database included were: ‘microscopic 
polyangiitis’, ‘wegener granulomatosis’ and ‘ANCA associated vasculitis’) which 
estimated the combined annual incidence (proportion) of GPA and MPA, ranging from 
0.9 to 1.4 cases per million and a prevalence (2013) of 4.2 per million. 
The evidences suggest that GPA and MPA are extremely rare in the population 
<18 years. No information on mortality and risk factors were available from 
epidemiological studies. Since very few cases were identified in the studies, 
extrapolation of incidence and prevalence could have led to risk of bias and discrepancy

resulting from use of different statistical methodologies hence need to be interpreted with 
caution.

Prevalence: 
Adult and Pediatric Patients:
The prevalence of GPA ranges from a low of 23.7 per million population in Paris (Mahr,
2004) to a high of 160 per million population in Sweden (Mohammad, 2007), with 
intermediate prevalence rates reported in north Germany (Herlyn, 2014), Norway 
(Koldingsnes, 2000), and Turkey (Pamuk, 2016). The point prevalence of GPA in Turkey 
was higher in men (50.9/1,000,000, 95 % CI 26–75.8) than in women (32.7/1,000,000, 
95 % CI 12.4–53; Pamuk, 2016). A recent study reports that in 2013 the prevalence of 
GPA in the UK was 134.9 (95% CI: 121.3, 149.6) with statistically significant lower 
prevalence in women than men  (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.97, p = 0.027) and in 
black/minority ethnic than White populations (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.84, p = 0.002).
The prevalence of MPA ranges from 9 to 94 per million population in the UK (Watts et al.
2012), Paris (Mahr, 2004), Germany (Reinhold-Keller et al. 2000, Herlyn, 2014), and 
Sweden (Mohammad, 2007). The point prevalence of MPA in Turkey was higher in 
women (29.4/1,000,000, 95 % CI 10.2–48.6) than in men (9.5/1,000,000, 95 % CI 0–
20.3; (Pamuk, 2016).

Demographics:
Mean age onset for GPA is 50 years, for MPA 60  70 years, (Koldingsnes et al. 2008). In 
pediatric patients, incidence of GPA and MPA is low (see information on reported 
incidence above) and hence, prevalence is expected to be significantly lower than in 
adults.
 Main existing treatment options: 
Treatment strategies for patients with GPA or MPA generally follow the 
recommendations provided by EULAR in collaboration with the European Renal 
Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA)
(Hellmich et al. 2023).
The EULAR 2022 recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis 
recommend that induction of remission therapy for newly diagnosed organ- or 
life-threatening disease or a major relapse typically consists of high-dose glucocorticoids 
combined with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide in order to rapidly reduce 
inflammation, induce disease remission, and prevent permanent organ damage.  
In relapsing disease, rituximab is preferred.  For induction of remission of non-organ-
threatening or non-life-threatening GPA or MPA, treatment with a combination of 
glucocorticoids and rituximab is recommended.  Methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil 
can be considered as alternatives to rituximab.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 24.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
rituximab
27
of
233
For maintenance of remission of GPA and MPA, after induction of remission with either 
rituximab or cyclophosphamide, EULAR guidelines recommend treatment with rituximab.  
Azathioprine or methotrexate may be considered as alternatives.  This recommendation 
was changed towards favoring rituximab in the 2022 update, in view of consistent results 
from two high-quality randomized controlled trials confirming a higher efficacy of 
rituximab compared with azathioprine and other recent prospective trials on the use of 
rituximab for maintenance of remission.  Therapy to maintain remission for GPA and 
MPA is recommended to be continued for 24–48 months following induction of remission 
of new-onset disease.  Longer duration of therapy should be considered in relapsing 
patients or those with an increased risk of relapse, but should be balanced against 
patient preferences and risks of continuing immunosuppression (Hellmich et al. 2023). 

Risk factors for the disease
GPA and MPA are two types of ANCA-associated vasculitides. Infectious, genetic, and 
environmental risk factors (and combinations of all three) have been described as being 
involved in either creating the environment for inducing ANCA production or inducing 
ANCA themselves (De lind Van Wijngaarden RA et al. 2008). 
No epidemiology studies were identified describing the mortality and risk factors 
associated with GPA and MPA in pediatric patients.  However, increased silica exposure 
has been observed to increase GPA/MPA cases, though exact association could not be 
established.  
 Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population: 
Mortality: Standardized Mortality Rate is 2.6  4.8 (Flossman et al. 2011). The increased 
mortality risk is persisting over time, Hazard Ratios are 1.68  4.4 (Luqmani et al. 2011). 
An analysis by the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) of Anti-Neutrophil 
Cytoplasmic Antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients enrolled in four trials 
reported a SMR of 2.6 (95% CI: 2.2; 3.1) when compared to age- and sex-matched 
general population controls. The most common causes of death within the first year were 
infection (48%) and active vasculitis (19%). After the first year, the major causes of 
death were cardiovascular disease (26%), malignancy (22%), and infection (20%) 
(Flossman et al. 2011).
The increased mortality in GPA patients has also been shown to be elevated and to 
persist over time in a UK study with HRs of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.08 2.60), 2.41 (95% CI: 
1.43 4.07), and 4.4 (95% CI: 2.0 9.8) at 1  5 years, 5  10 years, and 10  15 years, 
respectively. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), disease activity, sepsis, and cardiovascular 
disease are the primary causes of death, with malignancy being an additional late cause 
(Luqmani et al. 2011).
In GPA, the early causes of death are sepsis, disease activity and acute renal failure; the 
late causes include all listed above plus malignancy being an additional contributing 
cause [Philip et al. 2008]. 
In MPA, the primary causes of death are disease activity, sepsis, and cardiovascular 
disease, and malignancy is an additional late cause [Philip et al. 2008].

Outcome of the (untreated) target disease:
If untreated, GPA and MPA progress from limited disease processes (e.g., inflammation 
centered on the upper respiratory tract or lung) to a generalized phase characterized by 
multiple complications of small-vessel vasculitis (e.g., leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the 
skin, mononeuritis multiplex, alveolar hemorrhage, rapidly progressive 
glomerulonephritis, and mesenteric vasculitis) (Walton 1958; Fienberg 1981; Hoffman et 
al. 1992; Guillevin and Lhote 1995; Reinhold-Keller et al. 2000). End stage renal disease 
occurs in about 20% of patients with GPA/MPA (Koldingsnes et al. 2002, Jayne D.
2000). The prognosis for untreated GPA is poor, with a low likelihood of survival (Walton 
1958).
Adverse pregnancy outcomes: Pregnancy outcomes of patients with vasculitis,
especially small vessel vasculitis (GPA, MPA), are unknown because of the relative 
rarity of pregnancies among these patients. A retrospective survey in the US reported 
496 pregnancies before and 74 pregnancies after the diagnosis of vasculitis. The rate of 
pregnancy loss (including miscarriages and stillbirths) was higher among women who 
conceived after a diagnosis of vasculitis compared to those who conceived prior to 
diagnosis (33.8% vs 22.4%). The rate of preterm births increased significantly for 
pregnancies conceived after a diagnosis of vasculitis relative to those conceived before 
diagnosis (23.3% vs 11.4%). Only 18% of women reported worsening of vasculitis during 
pregnancy, but those who experienced increased vasculitis activity were more likely to 
deliver preterm (Clowse et al. 2013).

Important co-morbidities: 
Major categories of comorbidities are cardiovascular disease, malignancies, and 
infections (Kallennberg CG. 2014). 
In patients with AAV, the risk of coronary heart disease is 2-4 times higher, and stroke is 
also more frequent compare to the general population (Faurschou et al. 2009 , Morgan 
et al. 2009). Within 5-years of diagnosis of GPA or MPA, 14% of patients will suffer from 
a CV event (Suppiah et al. 2011).
Patients with GPA or MPA are at higher risk of overall malignancy compared to the 
general population (SIR 1.6-6.02) (Faurschou et al. 2008). This increased risk of overall 
malignancy in GPA/MPA patients is mainly driven by the increased risk of bladder 
cancer, Leukemia, NMSC and lymphoma (Pankhurst et al. 2004 ; Knight et al. 2002 ; 
Stone et al. 2006).
Risk factors for infection in GPA/MPA patients include the concomitant use of high dose 
corticosteroids and/or other immunomodulatory agents. Infection is implicated in death in 
up to 48% of cases short-term (within 6 months) and long-term (≥5 years survival) 
(Flossman et al. 2011; Luqmani et al. 2011). (Phillip et al. 2008).
SI.3 PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS

Incidence and Prevalence: 
Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV) is the most common form of pemphigus and comprises around 
80% of cases (range 70-90%) in both Europe and US (Baican et al. 2010; Woldegiorgis 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 24.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
rituximab
29
of
233
and Swerlick 2001; Micali et al. 1998; Simon et al. 1980).  The condition is rare with a 
prevalence of approximately 1 in 2,630.  Regardless of the patient’s geographic location, 
pemphigus patients present with the same clinical, histological, immunological, and 
disease course characteristics.  Men and women are equally affected, although there 
may be a slight female predominance.  
Seven epidemiological studies have assessed the incidence of PV in Europe.  One 
retrospective study of patients in the northern region of Greece from 1985 to 2004 
identified an average annual incidence of 8 new patients per year (Michailidou et al.,
2007). Two studies in Germany found that PV was rare, with one prospective study 
reporting only one case in 17 months yielding an incidence of 0.5 new cases per million 
population per year (Bertram et al, 2009) and another retrospective study reporting 14 
patients with PV between 1989 and 1997 yielding an overall crude incidence of 0.98 
(95% CI: 0.02; 5.54) cases per million population per year (Hahn-Ristic, 2002). A more 
recent analysis of German insurance claims data of 9.5 million individuals representing 
12% of the population of Germany identified 7,699 patients with an ICD10 code 
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th 
revision, German modification) for PV (L10.0), yielding an estimated prevalence of 94.82 
per million population (Hubner et al. 2016),  with a higher prevalence observed in women 
(108 per million population) than in men (81 per million population).  A prospective study 
of patients with autoimmune blistering diseases in Northwest Romania between 2001 
and 2007 identified 55 patients with PV over the course of the study (Baican A et 
al.,2010). A 13.5 year retrospective chart review from 1982 to 1996 in Italy observed 85 
PV cases yielding an incidence rate of 0.25 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, and a 
prevalence rate of 3.38 per 100,000 inhabitants (Micali et al., 1998).  A ten year 
retrospective historical cohort study of the general population in the UK from 1996 to 
2006 identified 138 patients with PV yielding a crude incidence of pemphigus vulgaris of 
0.68 (0.58 to 0.80) per 100,000 person years (Langan et al., 2008). In summary, seven 
studies conducted in five European countries indicate that PV is a rare disease with a 
low incidence.  Orphanet (a reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan 
drugs) has estimated the PV prevalence to be approximately 1/2,630 (Orphanet,
Accessed on 21 Feb 2017).
There is very limited information on the incidence and prevalence of PV in the USA with 
only 2 small studies identified in the literature search through May 2017. In Hartford 
County, Connecticut, 12 cases of pemphigus were identified during 1972-1977, yielding 
an estimated crude average annual incidence of 4.2 (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.3) new cases of 
pemphigus per million population (around 92% of these cases were PV) (Simon D.G et 
al., 1980).  In Olmsted County, Minnesota, 6 cases of PV were identified during 1950-
2000, yielding an estimated incidence of 3.5 (95% CI: 1.5 to 5.4) new pemphigus cases 
per million population (Alhashimi et al., 2005).
Globally, published incidence estimates in general populations range from around <1 to 
6.8 new cases per million population per year (Simon D.G et al., 1980, Alhashimi et al.,

2005, Hahn-Ristic, K., et al. 2002, Langan, S., et al.,2008); with higher rates reported in 
some settings (eg, 27 per million in Ashkenazi Jews in Israel (Pisanti, S. et al., 1974).

Demographics:
The onset of PV generally occurs in middle age, affects men and women equally, and 
occurs less commonly in children.  PV occurs in all races, although there seems to be a 
genetic predisposition link to Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class II alleles, and the 
disease is thus more common in people of Eastern European Jewish and Mediterranean 
descent (Hertl et al. 2006, Feldman and Ahmed 2011).
 Main existing treatment options:  
Despite the serious nature of PV and the potentially fatal prognosis if untreated, before 
rituximab became available as approved treatment option, only corticosteroids had 
regulatory approval in the EU and US. The lack of data from large, high-quality 
prospective trials comparing different therapeutic options for PV, in addition to variability 
in study protocols, outcome measures and results, had made it difficult to make definitive 
conclusions on the best approach to PV treatment (Gregoriou et al. 2015), and there are 
well-known side effects associated with high dose, chronic corticosteroid use that can 
result in morbidity involving multiple organ systems, and in some cases, mortality. 
The main objective in the treatment of PV is to control the disease, achieve complete 
remission, and prevent relapses, while minimising treatment-related adverse effects. 
The Autoimmune blistering diseases Task Force of the European Academy of 
Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) has published recommendations for the 
management of patients with pemphigus (Joly et al. 2020).  The guideline recommends 
the following first-line therapies of moderate and severe pemphigus: rituximab 
(2 infusions of 1 gm two weeks apart) in combination with systemic corticosteroids, o.r 
systemic corticosteroid alone or in combination with an immunosuppressive drug as 
corticosteroid-sparing agent (if rituximab is not available or contra-indicated).  After the 
initial cycle of rituximab, maintenance treatment with rituximab is recommended, and the 
rituximab dosing and timing of dosing depends on patient characteristics (initial disease 
severity, rate of anti- desmoglein (DSG) antibodies, patients with or without complete 
remission off therapy).  The EADV guideline also include rituximab as first-line treatment 
option for mild PV.
Recommendations of an international panel of experts on diagnosis and management of 
pemphigus are also available (Murrell et al. 2020), and include intravenous CD20 
inhibitors and specifically rituximab as a first-line therapy option for moderate to severe 
pemphigus.


Risk factors for disease: 
PV has a complex etiology involving interplay of genetic as well as environmental 
factors, most of which remain unknown. Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles 
have been identified as risk factors for the disease (Firooz et al. 1994, Animesh et al.
2011). Environmental factors such as viral infections, certain food compounds and 
drugs, pesticide, and ionizing radiation have been suggested.
Environmental factors such as drug intake, viral infections, physical agents, contact 
allergens and diet, as well as endogenous factors (e.g. emotional stress, hormonal 
disorders) have been described to act as inducing or triggering factors (IPPF website). 

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population: 
Mortality: A life-table analysis was conducted to estimate the 5-year prevalence of PV in 
the US and predicted mortality using data from a larger, more contemporary study 
carried out using United Kingdom (UK) electronic medical records that reported age- and 
sex-specific incidence rates for PV during 1996-2006 (overall crude incidence was 
6.8 [95% CI: 5.8, 8.0] per million population per year) (Langan et al. 2008).  It is 
reasonable to use this UK data for the US life-table analysis because the overall 
incidence rate, frequency of HLA class II antigen alleles, and prevalence of ethnicities at 
potentially higher risk of PV (e.g., Asian, Ashkenazi Jewish) are likely comparable 
between the UK and US.  Because there were no studies identified that reported 
mortality rates in US patients with PV, the life-table analysis used the Kaplan-Meier 
survival estimates reported in the UK study (e.g., 65% survival after 5 years) (Langan et 
al. 2008) and applied these and the age- and sex-specific incidence rates to the 2017 
US census population (2012 National Projections, Middle Series [United States Census 
Bureau]).  These results indicate that in 2017, 137 individuals with PV in the US are 
predicted to die, leaving a predicted 1,800 surviving incident cases.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes: The occurrence of PV during pregnancy is rare and 
evidence is limited to case series and single case reports (Daneshpazhooh et al. 2011). 
In a study, a retrospective search of Medline was conducted for case reports and series 
on PV during pregnancy. A total of 38 reports that described 49 pregnancies 
complicated with PV were identified. Exacerbation of PV was reported in 11 (22%) of the 
49 cases and stillbirths were recorded in 5 (10%) patients. Of the 44 live births, 20 (45%) 
neonates had PV lesions at birth and 24 (55%) were lesion-free (Kardos et al. 2009). A 
similar study in Iran identified 52 pregnancies in 48 women with pemphigus (including 41 
women with PV) between 1984 and 2006. Exacerbation of pemphigus was reported in 
28 cases (58%), abortion in 5 cases (9.6%) and postpartum flare in 23 cases (44%) 
(Daneshpazhooh et al. 2011).

Important comorbidities: 
PV is associated with corticosteroid-related comorbidities such as infections, Cushing 
syndrome (hypercortisolism), adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis (Hsu et al. 2016). 
PV has also been correlated with other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune

thyroid diseases (Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis), rheumatoid arthritis and

SI.4 NON-HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA
Adult Patients

Incidence: 
The non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies 
arising from lymphoid tissue. The most common types of NHL are diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which accounts for 30–40% of lymphomas in western 
countries, and follicular lymphoma (FL), which accounts for approximately 20  30% 
(Jaffe et al. 2001 [http://www.bluebooks.org/cgi-bin/who/contents?BOOK_ID=3). 
The incidence rate of NHL increased in the Western world between 1970 and 1990, 
but has stabilized since the late 1990s. The annual percentage increase in 
incidence rate in the US was 3.7% between 1975 and 1991 and 0.5% in the period 
2002   2011 (Howlader et al. 2014)[http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]). 
Recent review of cancer statistics in the US showed an annual percentage change 
in observed incidence rate of -2.1 between 2009 and 2013 (Howlader et al. 2016
[http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2013]) See Figure 1 (worldwide) and Figure 2
(Europe) below for age-adjusted incidence rates for NHL.

It is estimated that worldwide there were around 386,000 new cases of NHL in 2012 of 
which 79,000 new cases were in the European Union (EU-28) (Ferlay et al. 2013
[http://globocan.iarc.fr]). 
Pediatric Patients:
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the fourth most common malignancy in childhood and 
adolescence.  Mature B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) accounts for approximately 60% of all 
cases of childhood NHL, of which the majority are a high-grade.  Within this group of 
pediatric B-NHL, the main histological subtypes are BL, B-AL – analogous to acute 
mature B-cell French-American-British (FAB) L3 leukemia, DLBCL, primary mediastinal 
large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBL) and aggressive mature B-NHL, not further classifiable 
(Worch et al. 2013). Compared to adults, the incidence of NHL in childhood and 
adolescence is low.  The incidence rates of pediatric B-NHL in the U.S. by age group is


Prevalence: 
Adult Patients:
On 1 January 2009, there were approximately 530,919 men and women alive in the 
US who had a history of NHL  278,836 men and 252,083 women. This includes 
any person alive on 1 January 2009 who had been diagnosed with NHL at any point 
prior to 1 January 2009, and includes persons with active disease and those who 
are cured of their disease (Howlader et al. 2014
http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/).
Pediatric Patients:
Pediatric B-NHL represents the fourth most common malignancy in children, has an 
even higher incidence in adolescents, and is primarily represented by only a few 
histologic subtypes.  B-NHL can occur at any age but it is rare in children younger 
than 3 years of age (Minard-Colin et al. 2015).

Demographics:
Adult Patients:
The incidence of NHL rises exponentially with age and the median age at diagnosis 
is 66 years (Howlader et al. 2014. [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011). NHL is 
more frequent in males than females in all age groups and is more common in 
developed countries (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 above).
Pediatric Patients:
Burkitt lymphoma and B-AL account for 80% of pediatric mature B-NHL. The 
disease is diagnosed at a median age of 9 years with a predominance in boys 
(>4:1).  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma accounts for 10-20% of pediatric B-NHL and 
occurs more frequently in adolescents, with a median age of 11-12 years and a 
moderate sex ratio towards males (1.7:1).  Primary mediastinal large B-cell 
lymphoma accounts for 2% of B-NHL, typically occurs in older teenagers and affects 
more females than males.  (Worch et al. 2013, Minard-Colin et al. 2015, Giulino-

Main existing treatment options: 


Treatment for NHL in adults ranges from a watch-and-wait approach to aggressive 
therapy. Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with stage I/II 
disease, and in a subset of these patients, this may even be curative. Systemic 
chemoimmunotherapy is indicated for patients with advanced disease who are 
symptomatic or have adverse prognostic factors and consists of rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine and prednisone) or bendamustine or CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine 
and prednisone), as well as an anthracycline-based regimen in case of (histological 
or clinical) characteristics of transformation to aggressive lymphoma. Rituximab for 
2 years is recommended for maintenance/consolidation. Autologous stem-cell 
transplantation could be an option for selected cases of relapsing/ progressing 
disease (Dreyling et al, 2014; 
http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/suppl_3/iii76) and (Ghielmini et al,
2013; http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/561) 
For pediatric patients with mature B-NHL, intensive, systemic multi-agent 
chemotherapy is the cornerstone of therapy.  Effective therapy includes the use of 
intense short courses of non-cross resistant chemotherapy agents, with the specific 
regimen defined by the patient risk group allocation (limited, intermediate and 
advanced stages of disease) and including essential CNS prophylaxis. Two highly 
effective treatment strategies have been established: The French Lymphome Malin 
B (LMB) protocol and the German, Austrian, Swiss Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) 
protocol (Worch et al. 2013, Minard-Colin et al. 2015, Egan et al. 2019)

Risk factors for the disease
Risk factors for NHL include old age, infection with Epstein-Barr virus as an adult, 
exposure to mutagenic chemicals, radiation exposure and immunodeficiency, 
among others (Muller et al, 2005). For NHLs in general, severe immunodeficiency 
is the strongest known risk factor (Morton et al. 2008). FL does not have a distinct 
risk factor profile or major risk factors; however, a number of potential risk factors 
may increase the risk for this disease (Morton et al. 2008). Age, gender and 
ethnicity may also affect a person’s likelihood of developing FL (Ma S, 2012).
Environmental risk factors include certain chemicals such as pesticides (Ma S,
2012, Roulland et al, 2004). In addition, lifestyle factors such as dietary habits 
(Ambinder AJ, 2012), smoking (Morton et al, 2005), and alcohol consumption 
(Casey et al. 2007) are all associated with an increase in FL risk (Ma S, 2012). 
Furthermore, an association between increased body mass index (BMI) and risk of 
FL has been discussed in a number of studies, albeit with no significant results (Ma 
S, 2012).
There is also increasing evidence that molecular risk factors may contribute to the 
risk of FL (Ma S, 2012). For example: approximately 85% of patients with FL have a 
genomic translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving the BCL-2 gene on chromosome 
18 being translocated to chromosome 14 directly adjacent to the immunoglobulin 
heavy chain (IgH). This results in the overproduction of the BCL-2 protein, that

of
233
prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis (Godon A et al, 2003). However, although 
overexpression of BCL2 protein is detected in 90% of cases using 
immunohistochemistry, it is far from being specific for FL (Macintyre E et al, 2000,
Skinnider BF et al,1999). 
 Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population: 
Mortality: There were an estimated 199,630 deaths worldwide, and 30,700 deaths in 
Europe (EU-28) from NHL in 2012 (Ferlay et al. 2013 [http://globocan.iarc.fr]). In the 
US in 2014, there was expected to be an estimated 18,990 deaths from NHL 
(Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]). For NHL patients 
diagnosed between 2004 and 2010 in the US, the 5-year relative survival for patients 
was 66.9% (Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]).  In 
Europe, the 5-year relative survival of NHL patients was 54.6% in the period 
2000  2002 (Verdecchia et al. 2007). Survival rates of NHL patients differ between 
NHL subtypes. In Europe, the 5-year relative survival of FL patients in the period 
2000  2002 was 72.8%, and 49.3% for DLBCL. In the US, the 5-year relative 
survival of FL patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2010 was 86.1% and 60.4% for 
DLBCL patients (Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/).
Outcome of the (untreated) target disease: Patients with FL are generally 
considered incurable, whereas between 30 and 60% of patients with DLBCL 
achieve long-term remission or cure.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes: Lymphoma is the third most common malignancy 
occurring during pregnancy, with a reported frequency of 1 case per 6000 
pregnancies in Western countries (Onishi et al. 2022). A population-based cohort 
study in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project – Nationwide Inpatient Sample 
from 2003 to 2011 in Canada reported that the overall incidence of pregnancy-
associated NHL was 5.39 per 100,000 births. Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes 
were reported to be significantly higher in pregnant NHL women compared to 
control pregnant women (without NHL) that included pre-eclampsia (6.32% vs 
3.90%), cesarean section (39.81% vs 30.83%), preterm birth (17.10% vs 7.27%), 
postpartum blood transfusion (15.69% vs 5.98%), and infectious morbidities (1.17% 
vs 0.43%). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, pregnant women with NHL 
were more likely to have preeclampsia, odds ratio (OR) 1.57 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.06–2.32), cesarean section, OR 1.37 (95% CI 1.13–1.67), preterm 
births OR 2.50 (95% CI 1.94–3.22), postpartum blood transfusions, OR 2.73 (95% 
CI 2.10–3.55), and infectious morbidity, OR 2.81 (95% CI 1.16–6.79). Maternal 
(0.70% vs 0.01%) and fetal (1.17% vs 0.42%) mortality rates were significantly 
increased among pregnant women with NHL compared to pregnant women without 
NHL (El-Messidi et al. 2015). A retrospective study of clinically gathered data on 22 
pregnant NHL women in Japan showed that the 5-year overall survival was 63%. 
Among the 28 patients (22 NHL and 6 HL), 26 gave birth, one experienced 
intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) at 30 weeks of gestation, and one experienced 
spontaneous abortion early in the first trimester. The incidence of spontaneous 
abortion, IUFD, and preterm birth was similar between the 13 patients who received 
chemotherapy during pregnancy and the 15 patients who did not (spontaneous

abortion; 0% (0/13) vs. 7% (1/15), IUFD; 0% (0/13) vs. 7% (1/15), preterm birth; 
54% (7/13) vs. 53% (8/15)) (Onishi et al. 2022). A study on 80 patients diagnosed 
with NHL during pregnancy in Belgium between 1986 and 2019, reported that 54 
(68%) pregnant patients received chemotherapy, including rituximab. Four early 
pregnancies were terminated. Among 76 ongoing pregnancies, there was one 
stillbirth (1·3%). Overall, there was a high incidence of small for gestational age 
(39%), preterm delivery (52%), obstetric (41%) and neonatal complications (12·5%) 
(Maggen et al. 2021).

Important co-morbidities: 
As a disease presenting in older adults, NHL is frequently associated with co-
morbidities, which can often be a therapeutically limiting problem in older cancer 
patients.
In a population-based study conducted in the Netherlands in 904 patients with newly 
diagnosed NHL, 40% had at least one comorbid condition at diagnosis. When 
analyzed by age group, 20% of patients younger than 60 years, 43% of patients 
aged 60–69 years, and 61% or more of patients over 70 years of age had at least 
one co-morbid condition at diagnosis (van Spronsen et al. 1999). The prevalence of 
comorbidity among patients with low-grade NHL was similar to that for 
intermediate/high-grade NHL.
Some of the important comorbidities reported in the NHL population include 
cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and secondary malignancies. Patients with severe cardiac or respiratory 
disease may be unable to tolerate rituximab-related infusion-related reactions. 
Patients with renal, hepatic and/or cardiac disorders may be at increased risk of 
complications related to chemotherapy. Patients with pre-existing chronic or latent 
infections and/or patients who are already immunosuppressed as a result of co-
morbid conditions or their treatment (such as patients requiring treatment with 
corticosteroids) may be at increased risk of infections associated with combined 
chemo-immunotherapy.
SI.5 CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

Incidence: 
The World Health Organization classification scheme considers B-cell chronic 
lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in an 
aggregate category (CLL/SLL), because of shared clinicopathological features. The 
incidence rate of CLL is approximately three times that of SLL (Dores et al. 2007). 
The HAEMACARE project estimates that the incidence rate of SLL/CLL was 4.92 
per 100,000 in 2000  2002 (Sant et al. 2010). A total of 15,720 new cases of CLL 
were projected to occur in the US in 2014 (American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts 
& Figures 2014. Atlanta: American Cancer Society; 2014 
[http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/webcontent/acsp
c-042151.pdf]). Between 2007 and 2011, the US average annual age-adjusted 
incidence rate was 4.4 per 100,000 patient-years (age-adjusted to the 2000 US 
Standard Population); rates were higher in males than females (6.0 per 100,000

patient-years vs. 3.1 per 100,000 patient-years), and higher in white Americans than 
in African Americans (4.7 per 100,000 patient-years vs. 2.9 per 100,000 patient-
years) (Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]). The incidence 
of CLL per 100,000 population in the US was 0.0% under age 29; 0.1-1.9% between 
30 and 49; 3.7  16.7% between 50 and 69; 20.0  36.9% above 70 years of age 
based on Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data, based on patients 
diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 (Howlader et al. 2014
[http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/])

Prevalence: 
The 1-, 5- and 10-year prevalence estimates of CLL within the EU with the 
additional inclusion of Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in 2006 were 0.2 per 
10,000, 0.9 per 10,000, and 2 per 10,000, respectively (Watson et al. 2008). The 
estimated prevalence of CLL in the EU in 2012 is 2.83 per 10,000. This latter 
estimate is based on applying a compound annual growth rate of 2.74% (i.e., the 
rate of increase observed from 2002 [2.16 per 10,000] to 2008 [2.54 per 10,000]) to 
the 2008 CLL prevalence estimate. The 2008 estimated CLL prevalence was 
calculated by applying the methods of Watson et al. (2008) to the most recent 
Leukemia International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) data (GLOBOCAN 
2008) and data from the Scottish Cancer Registry.  The 5-, 20- and 35-year 
prevalence estimates of CLL in the US were 58,140, 121,098, and 126,193 on 1 
January 2011 (Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]).

Demographics:
The incidence rate of CLL increases with age. Over the period 2005 to 2009, the 
median age at diagnosis of CLL was 72 years of age in the US; 0.2% between 20 
and 34; 1.6% between 35 and 44; 9.0% between 45 and 54; 20.9% between 55 and 
64; 26.5% between 65 and 74; 27.8% between 75 and 84; and 14.0% 85+ years of 
age (Howlader et al. 2014 [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/])).
 Main existing treatment options: 
Available treatments generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse, 
and CLL remains an incurable disease, with the possible exception of the rare option 
of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which due to its toxicity and intensity and the 
need for a donor is available only to a very small fraction of younger patients. None 
of the available treatment options is adequate for all CLL patients (Hallek et al.
2011).
Current ESMO guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with 
CLL and SLL as well as NCCN Guidelines list different treatment strategies for front-
line therapy (Eichhorst et al. 2021, NCCN Guidelines v1 2020).  In addition to 
chemotherapy/rituximab combination (FCR), continuous treatment with Bruton 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib until progression or time-limited therapy 
with chemotherapy/anti-CD20 antibodies (including rituximab) as well as the 
combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab are recommended first-line therapies. 
Factors such as age/fitness of patients as well as mutational status (IGHV, TP53, 
del(17p)) are taken into consideration for choice of treatment.

Risk factors for disease
The aetiology of CLL is unclear; however, several risk factors associated with CLL 
have been identified. As well as age and gender (Gribben, 2010, Catovsky et al.
1989), there is a familial risk with family members of patients with CLL having a two-
to seven-fold higher risk of developing the disease (Shanshal et al. 2012). In 
addition, exposure to certain agricultural chemicals may also increase the risk of 
developing CLL, and associations between CLL and several viruses (such as 
human T-cell lymphotrophic viruses I and II and Epstein-Barr virus) have been 
suggested, but no conclusive evidence of causal relationship exists (Lamanna et al.
2016). 
Studies show that 4% of CLL patients over 40 years of age harbours a population of 
clonal B-cells with the phenotype of CLL or other B-cell malignancies. This 
asymptomatic condition is called monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (Shanshal 
et al. 2012, Lamanna et al. 2016) and progression to Leukemia requiring CLL-
directed therapy occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of MBL cases per year

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population: 
Mortality:  In Europe (EU-28), there were approximately 41,459 deaths from 
Leukemia of all kinds in 2012 (Ferlay et al. 2013 [http://globocan.iarc.fr]). It is 
estimated that 4,600 men and women will have died of CLL in 2012 in the US 
(American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2014. Atlanta: American Cancer 
Society; 2014 
[http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/webcont 
ent/acspc-042151.pdf]). In the US, the age-adjusted death rate is 1.4 per 100,000 
men and women per year. The age-adjusted death rate is higher for men (2.1 per 
100,000 men) than for women (0.9 per 100,000 women (Howlader 2014
[http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2011/]).
Outcome of the (untreated) target disease: Available treatments generally induce 
remission, although nearly all patients relapse, and CLL remains an incurable 
disease. In Europe, the 5-year relative survival of CLL and SLL patients in the 
period 2000  2002 was 69.1% (Marcos-Gragera et al. 2011).
Adverse pregnancy outcomes: No epidemiological evidence was found describing 
the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in CLL patients. The number of 
patients with CLL who become pregnant is extremely rare, since the median age for 
diagnosis is 72 years, only a few clinical cases have been reported. Managing CLL 
during pregnancy requires close cooperation between obstetricians and 
hematologists; due to the paucity of cases and the lack of specific guidelines 
(Murray et al. 2021).

Important co-morbidities: 
CLL is a disease of older adults with a median age at diagnosis of 65-72 years. 
Comorbidity is a frequent and often therapeutically limiting problem in older cancer 
patients.
In a study in unselected patients with CLL (Thurmes et al. 2008), nearly 90% had 
co-morbid conditions at the time of diagnosis and over 46% had at least one major

other than non-melanomatous skin cancer). Other important reported comorbidities 
include cardiac disorders (e.g., cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation etc), respiratory 
disorders (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), GI disorders (e.g., peptic 
ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease etc), and pulmonary embolism/deep vein 
thrombosis.
Patients with severe CV or pulmonary diseases may be unable to tolerate rituximab-
related infusion-related reactions (IRRs). Patients with renal, hepatic and/or cardiac 
disorders may be at increased risk of complications related to chemotherapy. 
Patients with pre-existing chronic or latent infections and/or patients who are already 
immunosuppressed as a result of co-morbid conditions or their treatment (such as 
patients requiring treatment with corticosteroids) may be at increased risk of 
infections associated with combined chemo-immunotherapy. In one retrospective 
study in patients with CLL, factors associated with risk of developing a major 
infection included a high serum creatinine concentration, as well as advanced 
disease stage, previous anti-neoplastic therapy, refractoriness to fludarabine-based 
therapy, high serum β2-microglobulin level, low serum albumin level and a low
granulocyte count Anaissie et al. 1998). In addition, patients with co-morbidities may 
be more likely to have an adverse outcome following a treatment-related 
complication. For example, in one study, the level of in-hospital mortality in CLL 
patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was found to be higher in patients with 
co-morbidities (21%) versus those without co-morbidities (9.5%) (Kuderer et al.
2006).

PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
SII.1 TOXICITY
SII.1.1 Single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies
In single- and repeat-dose IV toxicity studies, rituximab was non-toxic to monkeys at the 
various doses and schedules studied. The maximum single dose infused was 100 mg/kg 
and the highest repeat dose infused was 20 mg/kg weekly for 4 or 8 weeks. No animal 
deaths were attributed to rituximab in any of these studies. Moreover, there were no 
significant toxicologic effects from rituximab in any of the animals studied. Changes in 
body weight and body temperature were not observed, nor were changes in 
hematological or serum chemistry parameters. Other than effects consistent with the 
expected pharmacologic activity of rituximab (decreased B cells in peripheral blood and 
lymph nodes), there were no significant histopathologic findings.
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: 
Decline of peripheral B-cell counts in human beings, associated with its pharmacological 
action.
SII.1.2 Toxicology studies
Decreased peripheral B-cells, decreased B-cells in tissues, lymphoid atrophy, and 
alterations in hematology related to decreased B-cells.
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: 
Potential increased susceptibility to infection or an inadequate response to vaccination 
due to B-cell immunocompromisation.
SII.1.3 Reproductive toxicity
Rituximab was administered weekly to pregnant female monkeys during the period of 
organogenesis at doses of 20, 50, or 100 mg/kg. There were no findings of toxicity to the 
dams or developing fetuses. The only effect noted was the dose-dependent 
pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid organs of the fetuses. B-cell depletion 
following exposure in utero, which appeared to be reversible in infants once drug had 
cleared or fallen to non-effective levels.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 24.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
rituximab
43
of
233
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: 
No toxicity expected apart from B cell depletion. Potential risk is that maternal exposure 
to rituximab may lead to B-cell depletion in the human fetus/infant, either from in utero 
exposure, or from exposure to rituximab in breast milk in nursing infants.
SII.1.4 Embryofetal toxicity:
Potential risk of embryofetal toxicity resulting from systemic exposure to Recombinant 
Human PH20 (hyaluronidase)(rHuPH20) (rituximab subcutaneous).
Relevance to human usage: No
Discussion: 
Potential risk of embryofetal toxicity based on a very conservative interpretation of 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology data in animal studies at very high systemic 
exposure levels (reductions in fetal weight and increased number of resorptions) but did 
not show overt dysmorphogenic (i.e., teratogenic) potential. These findings are 
consistent with current knowledge of the natural activity of hyaluronidase. Studies in 
knock-out mice have demonstrated the importance of hyaluronan in normal heart 
development.
No data in humans have been collected and potential seriousness and outcomes are 
unforeseeable at this point in time.
SII.2 GENERAL SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY
SII.2.1 Mechanisms for drug interactions
The elimination of rituximab is mediated by both the specific CD20 receptor−mediated 
pathway and the non-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) clearance pathways. These data 
suggest that rituximab would not be expected to have many of the common mechanisms 
of drug−drug interactions with small molecules, including changes in protein binding, 
P450 activity, and transporters.
Relevance to human usage: No
Discussion: 
Although no specific drug interaction studies have been performed, based on PK data 
from Phase II/III studies, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and corticosteroids seemed 
to have little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.

RAVE Study
Data in this RMP are taken from the summary of clinical safety and Clinical Study Report 
(CSR) for the pivotal RAVE study. RAVE consisted of a 6-month remission induction 
phase followed by a 12-month remission maintenance phase (Months 6 to 18). 
A total of 99 patients received at least one dose of rituximab during the 6-month
remission induction phase.  The majority of patients in both groups completed the first 
6-month study period (93 of 99 [94%] and 91 of 98 [93%] in the rituximab and 
cyclophosphamide [CYC] groups, respectively).  Safety information was summarized
from randomization until the 6-month visit or the point of study discontinuation, 
whichever occurred earlier, to yield a total duration of follow-up of 47.6 patient-years in 
the rituximab group and 47.0 patient-years in the CYC group. A small proportion of 
patients crossed over to the opposite treatment or received different treatment according 
to best medical judgment or as a result of a deviation from study drug administration 
during the first 6-month study period.  The follow-up time for those patients who stayed 
on their initial treatment was 41.9 (rituximab only) and 40.5 (CYC only) patient-years, 
respectively.  
During the maintenance phase of the study, patients in RAVE were followed up to a 
common closeout (CCO) date, corresponding to the last patient’s 18-month visit.  During 
the maintenance phase, treatment changes were common; 123 patients completed 
18 months on their randomized treatment (61 of 99 [62%] on rituximab and 62 of 98 
[63%] on CYC).
In total, up to the 18-month visit, there were 140 patient-years of exposure with rituximab 
in the RAVE study.

Study ML22514
The following data are taken from the Summary of Clinical Safety and Clinical Overview. 
Study ML22514 was a therapeutic, prospective, Phase III, multi-center, comparative, 
randomized, open-label study comparing azathioprine versus rituximab, both in 
combination with low-dose corticosteroids, for the maintenance of remission in patients 
with ANCA-associated vasculitis.  In this study eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to 
either rituximab or azathioprine; randomization was stratified by newly diagnosed or 
relapsing disease.  Patients randomized to the rituximab arm received 500 mg IV 
rituximab at Day 1, Day 15, and Months 6, 12, and 18.  Patients randomized to the 
azathioprine arm received an oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, followed by a 
dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment 
discontinuation after 22 months).  Following the enrollment visit (Day 1) and a Day 15 
visit (patients on rituximab only), patients were monitored every 3 months through Month 
24, with a follow-up visit at Month 28.  After the completion of maintenance treatment 
(Month 18 for rituximab and Month 22 for azathioprine), patients in the rituximab arm 
were followed for 10 months while those in the azathioprine arm were followed for 6 
months.
One hundred fifteen patients (57 rituximab; 58 azathioprine) received study treatment 
during the study, more patients in the rituximab arm (83%) completed treatment 
compared with the azathioprine arm (54%). However, the proportion that completed the 
Week 28 visit was comparable between the arms (95% vs. 90%, respectively).

WA25615 study
Study WA25615 was a Phase IIa, international, multicenter, open-label, single-arm 
uncontrolled study. The overall design consisted of a 28-day screening period, an initial 
6-month Remission Induction Phase, followed by a minimum additional 12-month
Follow-Up Phase.  After Month 18, patients were followed at study visits every 3 months 
until the common closeout (CCO) date which occurred on 10 May 2018, 18 months after 
enrollment of the last patient.
The first patient was enrolled on 23 May 2013 and last patient was enrolled on 16 
November 2016.
All 25 patients completed all 4 rituximab infusions and the 6-month Remission Induction 
Phase.  A total of 24 out of 25 patients completed at least 18 months of the Follow-Up 
Phase; 1 patient withdrew on Day 476 before the 18-month visit due to an 
administrative/other reason and was transferred back to local hospital care.  Eight 
patients discontinued from the study between month 18 and the CCO, primarily due to 
administrative/other reasons: physician or family decision and/or transfer to adult care 
services for their GPA or MPA.  There were no withdrawals from the study due to AEs.  
Ten patients completed follow-up until the CCO (maximum up to 4.5 years [54 months]).  
At the time of CCO, 6 patients had entered Extended Follow-Up for continued 3 monthly 
monitoring visits as their peripheral B cells remained depleted following their last 
rituximab dose.

Exposure – Clinical Trials in Pemphigus Vulgaris
Study ML22196 
The following data are taken from the summary of clinical safety and clinical overview for 
Study ML22196.
Ninety patients (74 PV patients and 16 pemphigus foliaceus [PF] patients) were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms:  46 patients to the rituximab + prednisone 
arm and 44 patients to the prednisone arm.  More patients in the rituximab + prednisone 
arm (44 [95.7%]) completed the month 24 visit than in the prednisone arm (31 patients 
[70.5%]).
A protocol amendment was performed while the study was ongoing to include a 
post-treatment follow-up visit at month 36.  Because this protocol amendment was 
implemented in June 2015, while the study was ongoing, there were patients who had 
already completed the month 24 visit.  Therefore, the patients who had a follow-up visit 
that occurred after month 36 had their month 36 evaluations retrospectively 
documented.  The majority of patients in each treatment arm completed a post-treatment 
follow-up visit either at month 36 or after month 36 (44 patients [95.7%] in the 
rituximab + prednisone; 40 patients [90.9%] in the prednisone arm).  Of these patients, 
35 patients (76.1%) in the rituximab + prednisone arm and 29 patients (65.9%) in the 
prednisone arm were evaluated at month 36.  
Thirty-eight PV patients were randomized to the rituximab + prednisone arm and 36 PV 
patients to the prednisone arm.  In the rituximab + prednisone arm, 38 PV patients 
(100.0%) completed the month 24 visit compared with 30 PV patients (83.3%) in the 
prednisone arm.  In the rituximab + prednisone arm, 36 PV patients (94.7%) completed 
the month 36 or post- month 36 visit compared with 32 PV patients (88.8%) in the 
prednisone arm.

Exposure – Clinical Trials in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (Including 
rituximab IV and rituximab SC in combination with chemotherapy and as 
maintenance treatment)
Majority of data on rituximab monotherapy come from early trials conducted in patients 
with follicular lymphoma. Data from these trials were submitted with the initial Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) for MabThera via the Centrally Authorised Procedure 
(CAP) which was approved on 2 June 1998. The submission included a total of 
322 rituximab -treated patients with NHL, from seven trials. At the time, three of the six 
monotherapy trials were still ongoing. Final data from these three studies were submitted 
in the Type II variation that received a favorable decision on 15 July 2002. This resulted 
in an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). No significant new 
data on rituximab monotherapy have become available since then, with the exception of 
rituximab given as patients for maintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy 
(with or without rituximab), e.g the PRIMA study (MO18264). 
The development program for the subcutaneous formulation of rituximab in NHL was led 
by two pivotal trials; a Phase Ib dose-finding and dose-confirmation study in follicular 
lymphoma maintenance (Study BP22333), and a Phase III, two-stage, randomized study 
(Study BO22334/SABRINA), using the selected subcutaneous dose of 1400 mg in 
patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma.
Pooled exposure data from studies BP22333 (data cut-off 17 September 2013), 
BO22334 (data cut-off 31October 2017), MO18264 (data cut-off 31 December 2016), 
U4391G (data cut-off 15 August 2011), MO28107/MabEase, a randomized Phase III trial 
in DLBCL (data cut-off 31 December 2015) and MO28457, evaluating patients 
preference with subcutaneous versus intravenous MabThera/Rituxan (data cut-off 19
January 2015) are presented in the tables below.

regimen in untreated pediatric and adolescent patients aged 6 months to less than 18 
years presenting with advanced stage mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), 
specifically Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukemia (mature B-cell acute leukemia) (B-
AL), Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  and 
stage III plus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  upper limit of normal (ULN)  2, stage IV.  
Patients with PMLBL were not included in this part of the study
A total of 484 patients were enrolled into this study, of which 328 patients were 
randomized to either receive standard Lymphome Malin B (LMB)-96 chemotherapy plus 
6 infusions of rituximab (N=164, R-Chemo ITT set) or standard LMB-96 chemotherapy 
only (N=164, Chemo ITT set), respectively.  Of these, 160 patients (97.6%) in the 
Chemo ITT set and 162 patients (98.8%) in the R-Chemo set were treated according to 
protocol treatment. A total of 309 patients from the randomized portion and single arm 
portion of the study received rituximab and were included in the rituximab safety set.
Exposure - Clinical Trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Including 
Rituximab IV and Rituximab SC)
Rituximab in combination with FC in CLL patients was studied in two large, Phase III 
trials using IV formulation: Study ML17102/CLL8 in previously untreated CLL and study 
BO17072/REACH in relapsed/refractory CLL.  
Study BO25341/SAWYER using subcutaneous formulation of rituximab in CLL was 
based on a Phase Ib dose selection and Ctrough non-inferiority study in combination with 
FC. The study investigated a non-inferior Ctrough rituximab exposure when treated with a 
fixed dose of rituximab SC (1600 mg) as compared with the established rituximab IV 
CLL dose (500 mg/m2).
Pooled exposure data from studies BO17072 (data cut-off 06JUN2012), ML17102 (data 
cut-off 31Oct2011), BO25341 (data cut-off 17 Nov2017), are presented in the tables

Due to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell 
depleted patients, women of childbearing potential 
should use effective contraceptive methods during 
and for 12 months following treatment with 
MabThera. 
Pregnancy: IgG immunoglobulins are known to 
cross the placental barrier. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled data from 
studies in pregnant women; however transient B-cell 
depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported 
in some infants born to mothers exposed to 
MabThera during pregnancy. For these reasons 
MabThera should not be administered to pregnant 
women unless the possible benefit outweighs the 
potential risk. 
Breast-feeding: Limited data on rituximab excretion 
into breast milk suggest very low milk levels (relative 
infant dose less than 0.4%).  Few cases of follow-up 
of breastfed infants describe normal growth and

data are limited and the long-term outcomes of 
breastfed infants remain unknown, breastfeeding is 
not recommended while being treated with rituximab 
and optimally for 12 months following rituximab 
treatment.
In a non-randomized study, patients with relapsed 
low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) who 
received rituximab monotherapy when compared to 
healthy untreated controls had a lower rate of 
response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen 
(16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin 
(KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 69% when assessed 
for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). For chronic

SIV.2 LIMITATIONS TO DETECT ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused 
by prolonged or cumulative exposure.
SIV.3 LIMITATIONS IN RESPECT TO POPULATIONS TYPICALLY UNDER-
REPRESENTED IN CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation
The safety of using rituximab while pregnant or breastfeeding is not fully known, as 
pregnant and lactating women are excluded from clinical trials. Additionally, all patients 
in clinical trials (male and female) are required to use effective contraception during trial 
participation, and females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine 
pregnancy test within two weeks prior to randomization or rescue therapy.
Rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit 
outweighs the potential risk and due to the long retention time of rituximab in B-cell 
depleted patients, women of childbearing age must employ effective contraceptive 
methods during and for 12 months after treatment with rituximab. Moreover, breast-
feeding is not recommended while being treated with rituximab and optimally for 6 
months following rituximab treatment.

PART II: MODULE SV - POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE
SV.1 POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPOSURE
SV.1.1 Method used to calculate exposure 
An approximation of rituximab patient exposure was calculated uniformly across the 
world and across indications.  The report includes global brands (MabThera/Rituxan) 
as well as local trademarks/second brands.
The cumulative exposure patient estimates from IBD until 30 September 20225.  The 
following assumptions were used to stratify and estimate cumulative and interval 
exposures:
SV.1.2 Exposure Estimates by Indication
In the US, patient exposures for immunological disease types was based on dividing US 
sales volume (grams) of rituximab by a weighted average annual patient usage estimate 
for RA and vasculitis, which is estimated to be 3.1 grams/patient/year6.  The estimate is 
based on the following assumptions: RA retreatment interval6.9 months; RA adherence 
(average of first and second course)89%; RA average grams/course1.96; GPA 
adherence91%; GPA average grams/year5.0g. Utilization of rituximab across AI 
conditions was evaluated using a US-based healthcare claims database where the 
distribution of rituximab use across AI conditions was estimated and the six-month 
4 except in pediatric study WA25615 in GPA and MPA and study Intergroup B-NHL-2010

average was used to inform the current exposure estimates.  The rates were 54.7 % RA, 
4.3% lupus, 8.8% multiple sclerosis (MS), 3.9% myositis, 13.9% vasculitis, and 15.9% 
other AI.  Within each condition the percentage of unique (new) out of total patients 
treated for that condition was estimated.  For 2019, the percentages that are unique are: 
RA 28%, lupus 38%, 41% vasculitis, and all other immunology indications 40%.
The methodology for approximating patient exposures for immunological disease for ex-
US and ex-Japan was based on dividing total volume of rituximab [ex-US and ex-Japan] 
by average number of vials used per course per treatment.

Patient exposures for immunological disease types ex-US are further broken down into 
most frequently prescribed diseases including some of the off-label diseases. The 
estimated percentage splits are derived from market research (RA 78%; lupus 11%; 
vasculitis 5%; other AI diseases 6%7).  The estimated patient exposures for 
immunological disease types are provided in both unique and non-unique estimates.
The unique patient exposure accounts for the chronic nature of the disease and 
estimates treated patients, whereas non-unique patient exposure estimate counts 
treatments received by an average patient.  The unique patient exposure estimate is 
based on the assumption of new patients treated in a year derived from market research 
(56%7). Unique patient exposure estimates are not available for hematological 
malignancy disease types.
Patient exposure for hematological diseases8for Rituxan (IV) was estimated by 
dividing the estimated number of vials shipped to distributors for treatment of 
hematological diseases by the average number of vials course of treatment.  The 
average number of vials per course of treatment was based on market research results. 
The average number of vials per course of treatment was based on market research 
results (MabThera patient case market research 2017/2018; Rituxan tracker market 
research 2017/2018).  Hematological malignancies being considered for exposure 
estimates also include unapproved lymphoma and CLL indications.  For EEA and ROW 
regions, stratification of exposures by indication in the hematological malignancies was 
estimated using patient chart audit market research conducted in France, Germany, 
Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK), (EU5) in patients undergoing treatment for 
NHL or CLL (MabThera EU5 patient case market research Q3 2017).

Patient exposure for SC formulation in US: Patient exposure for Rituxan Hycela (SC) 
was estimated by the estimated number of vials shipped for treatment of hematological 
diseases by the average number of vials since launch.  We have leveraged IV split of 
volume (avg over 4 quarters) of new (67%) and continuing (33%) patients and IV 
compliance assumptions (continuing patient accounts receive 4 doses for the 3-month 
period - 75% compliance; new accounts receive 1 dose for the 3month period).  This 
results in an average number of vials of 2.8 per vials shipped per patient.
Hematological malignancies being considered for exposure estimates also include 
unapproved NHL and CLL indications.  For US, stratification of exposures by indication 
was estimated using patient chart audit market research in the UUSSA undergoing 
treatment for NHL or CLL.

Exposure estimates for age and gender
volumes and sales values the stratification of the estimated number of exposed patients 
in gender and age is based on data from the Anti-Rheumatic Therapy In Sweden 
(ARTIS) registry.
In hematological malignancies however, an estimate of the use of MabThera in patients 
aged less than 18 years of age comes from a Japanese study where the percentage use 
is 0.1% in this age category.  Estimation of the number of pediatric exposures (  18 
years) calculated is based on the demographic data from a post-marketing usage 
surveillance conducted in Japan for the duration of 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2006 
(n1,137) where the percentage use was 0.1% in this category.  All pediatric exposures 
were assumed to occur in NHL.  The remainder of the age estimates is derived from the 
EU5 market research data.
Currently Roche does not have sufficient data to provide stratification of patient 
exposure by age and gender for AI indications globally.  However, in Japan, following 
approval of the new AI indications (GPA/MPA and NS), 231 pediatric patients (  16 
years-old), 2 in GPA/MPA and 229 in NS were exposed to rituximab during the reporting 
interval, and 1,739 pediatric patients (18 in GPA/MPA and 1,721 in NS) have been 
exposed to rituximab cumulatively (since the IBD until 30 September 2022).
Exposure estimate by dose (applicable to hematological malignancies only) 
Stratification of exposures by dose in hematology (375 mg/m2 vs. 500 mg/m2) was also 
estimated from market research conducted in EU5 in patients undergoing treatment for 
NHL or CLL (500 mg/m2 is the approved dose for second and subsequent infusions of 
MabThera in CLL).

Exposure estimate by formulation (applicable to hematological malignancies only)
Stratification of exposures by IV and SC formulation in hematology was estimated by 
dividing the estimated number of vials shipped to distributors for treatment of 
hematological diseases by the average number of vials per course of treatment, which in 
turn was based on input from market research conducted in EU5 in patients undergoing 
treatment for NHL or CLL (MabThera EU5 patient case market research Q3 2017).
Exposure estimate including Pediatric/Adult split for GPA/MPA and NHL 
indications
Following the approval of MabThera in pediatric use for GPA/MPA in the US in 2019 and 
2020 in the EU, and NHL indication in the EU in 2020, a patient split between 
adult/children has been included in the patient-exposure estimation model.  The patient 
split for these indications was collected based on insights and statistics provided by the 
respective affiliates.  Based on these data, an estimated of 2% of total NHL patients 
corresponds to pediatric patients and 98% of them are adults.  Similarly, in the case of 
GPA/MPA, 2% of total estimated AAV (GPA/MPA) patients are children and 98% are 
adults.
Cumulative Exposure from Marketing Experience 
The estimated worldwide cumulative exposure to rituximab is presented in Annexure 7, 
which also includes data received from Business Partners.

PART II: MODULE SVI - ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION
SVI.1 POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
Drugs that have potential for misuse for illegal purposes are expected to share some 
general characteristics, such as psychoactive effects or, less commonly, anabolic effects 
or enhancement of hemoglobin levels. The lack of evidence of such side-effects that 
may lead to misuse for illegal purposes, in addition to the Warnings and Precautions 
section of the SmPC (which states that rituximab should be administered in an 
environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available, and under the 
close supervision of an experienced physician), make it highly unlikely that there is a 
potential for misuse of rituximab for illegal purposes. To date, no reports of misuse of 
rituximab for illegal purposes have been received.

Potential mechanisms: 
All Indications
Rituximab’s anticipated mechanism of action induces B-cell depletion that can lead to a 
suppressed immune system. In addition, previous or concomitant immunotherapy, bone 
marrow infiltration, and/or corticosteroid therapy can be important contributing factors.  
For NHL/CLL; underlying disease can also contribute to immunosuppression. It is 
possible that B-cell depletion   associated hypogammaglobulinemia caused by rituximab 
could increase the risk of severe viral infections or viral reactivation and opportunistic 
infections, especially in patients with other predisposing conditions (e.g., T-cell 
deficiencies, bone marrow infiltration and/or immunotherapy, concomitant chemotherapy, 
previous immunosuppressive therapy).

CSR 1088458 study Inter B NHL Ritux 2010 (11 March 2019)
Characterization of the risk:
Frequency with 95% Confidence Interval (CI):
RA
The overall rate of infection was 75.7 events per 100 patient years. This was numerically 
less than that observed in the pooled placebo population (90.39 events per 100 patient 
years) and was stable across multiple treatment courses (All Exposure data cutoff: 
September 2012).  
The overall rate of serious infection in rituximab-treated patients was 3.76/100 patient-
years (2.71/100 patient-years in patients observed for > 5 years). This is comparable 
with placebo populations (3.79; CI: 2.80; 5.13) and the rate remained stable over time 
and across multiple treatment courses (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
Bacterial infections were seen in 9% of patients, the biggest share of those being 
bacterial cellulitis at 3%.  Species specific reporting was led by Staphylococci and 
Streptococci though both accounted for <1% each (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).

Viral infections had the highest proportion of pathogen specific infections reported, at 
19%. Influenza viruses accounted for 8% of those, followed by Herpesviridae family at 
7% and viral gastroenteritis at 3%.
Fungal infections were reported in 9% of events; vulvovaginal mycotic infection and tinea 
pedis accounted for 3% each (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
In the All Exposure RA population, 22 potential opportunistic infections (of 12 different 
types) were identified in 21 (5.8%) patients (rituximab 0.05 events/100 patient-years; 
placebo, 0.09 events/100 patient-years).
GPA/MPA
In RAVE, the rate of serious infections (per patient-year) was similar between the two 
treatment groups (0.25 for rituximab, 0.28 for cyclophosphamide) at 6 months. The 
proportions of patients who experienced serious infections by 18 months were also 
similar between the rituximab (15 patients or 15.2%) and cyclophosphamide (15 patients 
or 15.3%) groups. The rates of serious infections (per patient-year) were also similar 
between the two groups at 18 months: 0.13 with 95% CI: 0.08; 0.20 for the rituximab 
group and 0.16 with 95% CI: 0.10; 0.24 for the cyclophosphamide group.
The frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar to that seen in other 
studies of vasculitis patients and appeared to largely reflect the influence of concurrent 
or previous immunosuppressive therapy, underlying disease, and corticosteroid therapy. 
As pneumocystis infections are known to occur in GPA/MPA, patients in RAVE were 
required to receive pneumocystis prophylaxis.  After the 6-month remission induction 
phase and the 12-month remission maintenance phase period of the RAVE study there 
had been a total of 2 non-serious opportunistic infections (Mycobacterium avium 
complex and Esophageal candida) reported in the rituximab group, and 2 opportunistic 
infections (1 serious and 1 non-serious) in the cyclophosphamide treatment group. 
In Study WA27893 (RaVeR) in adults, fourteen patients had 24 serious infections, for an 
incidence rate of 7.11 per 100 patient years. The infection profile observed in this study 
was consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab in the patient population.
In Study ML22514 in adults, infections occurred at a comparable frequency between the 
arms (53% rituximab vs. 57% azathioprine). The incidence of serious infections was 
similar (12%) in both arms. The infection profile observed in this study was consistent 
with the known safety profile of rituximab in the patient population. Three patients 
reported opportunistic infections; two patients in the rituximab arm experienced one 
event each of severe oesophageal candidiasis and moderate pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia, and one patient in the azathioprine arm experienced moderate atypical

mycobacterial pneumonia. No events of PML, or hepatitis B reactivation were reported in 
this study.
In the DSR 1081144, a total of 126 AEs (19.8%) including 102 SAEs were reported in 
the SOC Infections and infestations. The most frequently reported PTs in this SOC were 
infection, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, sinusitis and pneumonia bacterial; 
the reported infections are consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab. No event 
of PML was reported in the DSR 108114.
In pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS), during the overall study period, 105 infection AEs 
were reported in 23 patients (92%) of which the majority (96 out of 105 AEs [91%]) were 
reported to be non-serious.  Similar to the Remission Induction Phase, the most 
frequently reported infections during the overall study period were upper respiratory tract 
infections (12 patients [48%]) all of which were non-serious.
Pemphigus vulgaris
In Study ML22196, fourteen patients (36.8%) in the rituximab + prednisone arm 
experienced 43 treatment-related infections and 15 patients (41.7%) in the prednisone 
alone arm experienced 28 treatment-related infections.  The most frequent infection PTs 
(occurring in 5% in either treatment arm [rituximab + prednisone arm vs. prednisone), 
were: bronchitis (3 patients [7.9%] vs. 7 patients [19.4%]), urinary tract infection (2 
patients [5.3%] vs. 3 patients [8.3%]), fungal infection (2 patients [5.3%] vs. 2 patients 
[5.6%]), skin bacterial infection (1 patient [2.6%] vs. 3 patients [8.3%]), herpes virus 
infection (3 patients [7.9%] vs. 0 patients), herpes zoster (2 patients [5.3%]  vs. 1 patient 
[2.8%]), oral herpes (2 patients [5.3%] vs. 1 patient [2.8%]), and conjunctivitis (2 patients 
[5.3%] vs. 0 patients).
In Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX), no opportunistic infections occurred during the study.
NHL/CLL
Infections are very common in patients receiving rituximab ( 10% of patients), based on 
pooled clinical trial experience.
In order to provide a coherent view of the rates of infections associated with use of 
rituximab in various patient sub-populations, the clinical data below are presented sub-
divided by oncological indication and stage(s) when rituximab was administered (DSR 
1066792, dated March 2016).
NHL Induction Only (BO16368, M39021, M39045)
Forty-nine (49) % of patients (384 out of a total 778 patients) who received rituximab in 
the induction phase reported at least 1 infectious adverse event (AE).  In 47% of 
reported infectious events, the infectious agent was unspecified.

Bacterial infections were reported in 4.5% of patients. E. coli was the commonest 
bacterial pathogen (10 events), followed by Staphylococcus (7 events).  No single type 
of infection, however, stood out and none accounted for more than 1% of events.  The 
pattern was similar for serious infections with E. coli and Staphylococci leading the 
counts but no single event accounting for a majority share of events.
Viral infections were reported in 5.4% patients, with Herpesviridae accounting for 2.7% 
and hepatitis B accounting for 0.3%.  A similar trend was noted for serious infections.
Fungal infections accounted for 2.3% patients with Candida spp accounting for 1% of 
these, followed by Pneumocystis at 0.7%.  A similar trend was observed for serious 
fungal infections with Candida causing 2 out of the 3 reported fungal SAEs.
Opportunistic infections were reported in 0.6% cases (2 cases of Candida infection, 2 of 
Herpesviridae and 1 case of aspergillosis).  No opportunistic bacterial infection was 
reported (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
NHL Induction and Maintenance (E1496, E 4494, M39022)
Sixty (60) % of patients in studies where rituximab was given during both induction and 
maintenance phases for NHL reported at least 1 infectious event, 7.7% of which were 
reported as serious; in 56% of cases the causative agents were unspecified.
Bacterial infections were reported in 3.2% of patients, but no single species was 
responsible for a majority of infections.  In 1.2% patients the bacterial infections were 
reported as serious, with Clostridium difficile reported in 0.2%.
Viral infections were reported in 5.7% of patients with Herpesviridae forming the largest 
group, being reported in 4.4% of patients.  The majority of viral infections were non-
serious with only 1.1% of the patients being reported as serious; Herpesviridae remained 
the commonest reported agent in this group.
Fungal infections were reported in 2.8% of patients, serious fungal infections reported in 
1.8%.  Candida was the commonest reported fungal infectious agent at 1.8% of all 
infections and 0.6% of serious infections.
Opportunistic infections were reported in only 0.33% of patients, including 1 case of
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP).  No viral or bacterial opportunistic infections 
were reported (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
NHL Maintenance Only (MO18264)
Forty-four (44) % of patients who received rituximab for maintenance therapy reported at 
least 1 infectious AE.

Bacterial infections accounted for 4.4% patients with E. coli reported most commonly at 
1% and Staphylococci at 0.8%. Two cases of serious infections were reported.
Viral infections accounted for 7.2% patients with Herpes spp being the most significant 
recognized infectious agent in this group at 4.6%. Six cases of serious viral infections 
were noted, including one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
Fungal infections were reported in 1.8% of patients, with Candida spp accounting for 
0.8% of these cases.  No serious fungal infections were reported.
Opportunistic infections were reported in only 2 cases which included 1 case of PML and 
1 of mycobacterial infection.  No fungal or bacterial opportunistic infections were 
reported (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
B-NHL pediatric (BO25380)
Infections were common during the overall treatment period of the study, occurring in 
52.3% of subjects in the chemotherapy arm and 62.3% of subjects in the chemotherapy 
plus rituximab arm.  The most common infections (10%) reported in the chemotherapy 
plus rituximab arm were sepsis (17.9%), device related infection (13.0%) and lung 
infection (13.0%).
CLL (BO17072, ML17102)
Thirty-three (33) % of patients administered rituximab in clinical trials reported at least 1 
infectious adverse event; 18% of these were serious events.  In 24% of these cases the 
causative agent was unspecified. 
Bacterial infections were reported in 2.1% of patients.  Cellulitis was reported most 
commonly (0.3%) but no specific organism was noted.  For serious infections, bacteria 
were reported in 1.8% patients.
A total of 9.6% of patients reported viral infections while on rituximab during CLL clinical 
trials.  Herpesviridae accounted for 5% among these and hepatitis B accounted for a 
further 1.1%. 3.8% of patients reported serious viral infections with Herpesviridae
reported most commonly, followed by hepatitis B.
Fungal infections were reported in 3.6% patients with Candida reported in 1.6% and P. 
jirovecii reported in 0.7%.  Serious fungal infections were reported in 1.3% patients, P. 
jirovecii accounting for 0.7%.
Opportunistic infections were reported in 2.9% cases. The leading pathogens in this 
group were PJP (5 cases) and Aspergillus (4 cases). No bacterial opportunistic 
infections were reported (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).

Severity and nature of risk:
RA
In the All Exposure population, 72.6% (2611/3595) of patients experienced at least one 
infection. Infections observed in ≥ 5% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection 
(URTI, 26%), nasopharyngitis (18%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 17%), bronchitis (14%), 
diarrhea (11%), sinusitis (12%), influenza (8%), gastroenteritis (7%), and pneumonia 
(5%). The majority of infections were mild to moderate in severity.  Severe infections 
(CTC Grade 3) were reported in 8% of cases, and were life threatening in   1% and 
fatal in   1%. 
The rate of all infections was highest during the first 12 months after administration of 
rituximab, decreased thereafter and remained stable across multiple treatment courses.  
Notably, the rate of serious infections was not higher during the first 12 month period 
after first exposure to rituximab than in the subsequent periods (DSR 1066792, dated 
March 2016).  The rate and nature of all infectious events was similar over multiple 
treatment courses, with no evidence of an increased risk of infection with cumulative 
exposure to rituximab.
Seven serious opportunistic infections were reported in the All Exposure RA population, 
and 1 in the original placebo treatment-group.
GPA/MPA
Upper respiratory tract infections were the commonest reported infections (8.1%, 8/99), 
followed by nasopharyngitis (6.1%), sinusitis (5.1%), UTI (5.1%), and pneumonia (4%), 
(DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
Serious infections comprised mainly respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients 
experienced mild-to-moderate (Grade 1 or 2) infections. 
Data from two investigator-sponsored studies of refractory/relapsing GPA/MPA, 
comparing the dose of 2x1000 mg vs. 4x375mg/m² (Jones et al. 2009 and Smith et al.
2012), are similar to the data from the RAVE study regarding the infection rate. The most 
frequently reported serious infections were RTIs, as reported in RAVE.
Patients in RAVE were required to receive pneumocystis prophylaxis.  After 18 months 
there had been a total of 2 non-serious opportunistic infections (Mycobacterium avium 
complex and esophageal Candida) reported in the rituximab group.
In Study WA27893, from the 33 events of infections reported, 21 were Grade 3 to 5. The 
most commonly reported infection was pneumonia.

In Study ML22514 most infections reported were mild or moderate in intensity and were 
manageable. In the rituximab arm, the most commonly reported infections were 
bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis and rhinitis. 
In pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS), during the overall study period, the majority of 
infection AEs (96 out of 105 AEs [91%]) were reported to be non-serious.  Similar to the 
Remission Induction Phase, the most frequently reported infections during the overall 
study period were upper respiratory tract infections (12 patients [48%]) all of which were 
non-serious.
Pemphigus Vulgaris
A total of 217 AEs were reported in the SOC infections and infestations in the Company 
safety database [DSR 1080390]. The most frequently reported to the Company 
database (postmarketing) infectious PTs were nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sepsis, 
infection and influenza.  The nature of infectious AEs is in line with the known safety 
profile of the drug. Of all the AEs in the SOC, 51.6% (112/217) AEs were reported as 
serious. There were no reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
with rituximab for pemphigus indication [DSR 1080390].
In Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX), the majority of infections were Grade 1 or 2 
(five patients in the rituximab arm experienced grade 3 or higher infections).  One patient 
in the rituximab arm had an infection that led to treatment interruption (Grade 1 oral 
herpes).
NHL/CLL
Patients with NHL or CLL are already at risk of infection due to their underlying disease. 
This risk is increased by the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy, and the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids and particular 
cytotoxic agents (e.g., fludarabine). Damage to mucosal barriers (e.g., due to mucositis 
or diarrhea) may also increase the risk of infection. 
Serious viral infections including new infections, reactivation of latent infections and 
exacerbation of existing infections, some with a fatal outcome, have been reported in 
patients treated with rituximab.  The majority of the patients had received rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
It is important to note that in many patients with hematological malignancies who 
develop infections, a pathogen is never identified because of the need to institute broad 
spectrum antibiotic/antiviral therapy without delay.

NHL Induction Only (BO16368, M39021, M39045)
In the study population of the above mentioned trials, 49% (384/778) of patients reported 
at least 1 infectious event; the pathogen was unspecified in 46% cases, and infections-
not elsewhere classified (NEC) formed the largest group. Where classification was 
noted, bronchitis was commonest, being reported in 4.2%, followed by pneumonia 
(3.3%).  Other infections reported in more than 1% of patients included naso-pharyngitis, 
sinusitis, URTI, LRTI, neutropenic infection, and UTI. 
The percentage of patients reporting  Grade 3 infections stood at 12% (96/778).  Where 
information was available regarding the specific infection, pneumonia formed the largest 
group among severe infections with 1.6%, LRTI and Herpesviridae were reported in 
0.6% each.  In 12 cases (1.5%) the infectious event was associated with fatality (DSR 
1066792, dated March 2016).
NHL Induction and Maintenance (E1496, E 4494, M39022)
In the study population of the above mentioned studies, 60% (547/917) of the patients 
administered rituximab reported at least 1 infectious event.  The pathogen was 
unspecified in 56% cases, and infections-NEC again formed the largest group.  Where 
classification was noted, URTI was the commonest reported at 3.7%, followed by 
neutropenic infection at 3.2%.  Other infections reported in  1% of patients include 
bronchitis, LRTI, naso-pharyngitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, RTIs, rhinitis, sepsis, 
sinusitis and UTI.
The percentage of patients reporting  Grade 3 infections stood at 18% (161/917).  
Where classification was noted, neutropenic infection was reported most (3.2%), 
followed by sepsis (1.3%), and pneumonia (1.1%).  In 12 cases (1.3%) the infectious 
event had a fatal outcome (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
NHL Maintenance Only (MO18265)
In the PRIMA study, 44% (220.501) of patients reported at least 1 infectious event while 
on rituximab maintenance therapy.  The pathogen was unspecified in 43% cases, with 
infections-NEC constituting the largest fraction.  Where classification of infection was 
noted, bronchitis was the commonest at 11%, followed by URTI at 5.8%.  Other 
infections that were reported in   1% of patients included lung infection, naso-
pharyngitis, neutropenic infection, pharyngitis, pneumonia, RTI, rhinitis, sinusitis, and 
UTI.
The percentage of patients reporting   Grade 3 infections stood at 4.8% (24/501).  No 
specific site/type of infection stood out. Infection had a fatal outcome in 2 cases, 
including one case of PML (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).

Pediatric B-NHL (BO25380)
Infections were common during the overall treatment period of the study, occurring in 
52.3% of subjects in the chemotherapy arm and 62.3% of subjects in the chemotherapy 
plus rituximab arm. The most common infections (10%) reported in the chemotherapy 
plus rituximab arm were sepsis (17.9%), device related infection (13.0%) and lung 
infection (13.0%).  Grade 3 infections were reported in 19.1% of subjects in the 
chemotherapy plus rituximab arm (primarily events of sepsis).  Three (1.2%) of the 
events in the chemotherapy plus rituximab arm were fatal (all events of sepsis).
CLL (BO17072, ML17102)
Thirty-three (33)% of patients (226/676) in CLL clinical trials reported at least 1 infectious 
event.  The pathogen was unspecified in 24% cases.  Where infection classification was 
noted, bronchitis was the commonest reported at 3.6%, followed by pneumonia at 3.5% 
and URTI at 3.4%. Other infections which were reported in  1% of patients included 
naso-pharyngitis, RTI, sepsis and sinusitis.
The percentage of patients reporting  Grade 3 infections was 18% (121/676). The 
commonest reported infection in this group was pneumonia (4.0%), followed by sepsis 
and bronchitis (1.5% each).  Infectious events led to fatality in 22 cases (3.3%), (DSR 
1066792, dated March 2016).
Opportunistic infections are infections occurring in a compromised host, which are 
caused by microorganisms that normally do not cause serious disease in healthy people.  
A range of organisms can cause opportunistic infections and these overlap with 
non-opportunistic infections (which occur in healthy individuals), neutropenic infections, 
and reactivation of latent viral infections.  Opportunistic infections range in severity from 
mild to life-threatening or fatal.  Commonly recognized serious opportunistic infections 
include viruses (Cytomegalovirus [CMV], Varicella Zoster, Herpes Simplex and John 
Cunningham [JC] viruses), fungi (Pneumocystis pneumoniae/jiroveci, Aspergillosis, 
some Candida infections, cryptococcal and coccidioido-mycosis), bacteria 
[Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium tuberculosis] and protozoa 
[Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma]).

Seriousness/Outcomes:
Serious infections for oncology and GPA/MPA trials were defined as those infections 
which resulted in death, a life-threatening event, hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
For RA trials, serious infections were defined as those which were reported as serious 
adverse events (SAEs) or required treatment with an IV anti-infective.
RA
In the All Exposure population (all data, irrespective of treatment course) 415/3595 
(11.5%) patients experienced a total of 532 serious infections following treatment with 
rituximab, with an overall rate of 3.76 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 3.46;4.09), 
2.71/100 patient-years in patients observed for > 5 years. This is comparable with 
placebo populations (3.79; CI: 2.80; 5.13) and also with rates reported previously in 
rituximab-treated patients at 9.5 years observation (3.94/100 patient-years and 3.26/100 
patient-years, respectively), (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016). 
The rate of serious infections was stable across time periods and also between multiple 
courses of rituximab treatment. There was no evidence of an increased risk of serious 
infection with cumulative exposure to rituximab.
Table 22, displays the rates of serious infections by treatment course over the first 7 
courses, and Table 23 displays a summary of the serious infections reported in at least 5 
patients.

With the exception of the 15 deaths, the majority of infections (non-serious and serious 
infections) followed a typical course and were successfully treated with standard 
antibiotics.
The most frequently reported serious infections in the All-Exposure population were 
lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI; 3%, 114 patients), predominantly pneumonias 
(2.7%, 96 patients).  Of the 11.5% patients who reported serious infections, 8% reported 
no specific pathogen, 2% reported bacteria and   1% reported viruses and fungi each
(DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).

In the All Exposure RA population, 7 serious opportunistic infections were reported. 
These included 2 cases of atypical pneumonia (no organisms isolated) and 1 case each 
of Candida septicemia, pharyngeal abscess (organism unspecified), Scedosporium lung 
infection, PJP (leading to withdrawal) and PML (with fatal outcome).  One event of PJP
occurred in the placebo population.  Among other infections, 1 case of de novo Hepatitis 
B Virus (HBV) infection occurred in the All Exposure population, as well as 2 cases of 
pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), both treated with a course of standard anti-TB medication. 
There were no reported cases of extrapulmonary TB, atypical Mycobacterial infection or 
multidrug-resistant TB (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
Fifteen serious infections ( 1%) in the All Exposure population resulted in death.  Seven 
fatal cases were from respiratory infections, 6 from septic events (including septic shock) 
and 1 patient each died from C.difficile colitis and PML.  No apparent relationship 
between time of event onset and time since the first rituximab dose was identified (range 
of 145 to 2886 days).  Four of the fifteen serious infection events with fatal outcome 
were assessed as related to the study treatment (2 events of septic shock, and 1 each of 
sepsis and PML); while other events were assessed as not related to the study 
treatment (DSR 1066792, dated March 2016).
GPA/MPA
In the RAVE study the proportions of rituximab patients experiencing a serious or severe 
(Grade  3) infectious adverse event groups at 6 months was 11.1% (11/99 patients) for 
serious infections and 10.1% (10/99 patients) for severe infectious events. No infection 
events were reported as fatal in rituximab treated patients. By 18 months the incidence 
of serious infections was 15.2%. The incidence of serious infections reported in 
rituximab-treated patients were consistent with those observed with the control arm 
(cyclophosphamide) treatment, where the incidence of serious infections was 15.3%.  
Similarly, the incidence of severe infections was comparable at 13.1% for the rituximab 
and 13.3% for the cyclophosphamide group at 18 months.
Given the small number of serious and/or severe infectious events reported, no single 
organism (bacterial, viral or fungal) stood out from the data (DSR 1066792, dated March 
2016).
The 2 opportunistic infections that were reported in the RAVE study were non-serious.  
In Study WA27893, fourteen patients had 24 serious infections with the most reported 
terms being gastroenteritis, influenza, pneumonia and staphylococcal bacteremia. One 
patient died due staphylococcal bacteremia and septic shock.
In Study ML22514, the incidence of serious infections was similar between the two 
treatment arms (12.3% rituximab vs 12.1% azathioprine) and the most commonly 
reported serious infection in the rituximab arm was bronchitis. A total of three

opportunistic infections were reported in study ML22514 (all serious); two patients in the 
rituximab arm experienced one event each of severe oesophageal candidiasis and 
moderate pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and one patient in the azathioprine arm 
experienced moderate atypical mycobacterial pneumonia. One patient in the 
azathioprine arm died due to infection versus none in the rituximab arm. 
In the DSR 1081144 (data cut-off date: 03-Mar-2017) the following serious infections 
were reported in the Roche global safety database; pneumonia (n=18), infection (not 
otherwise specified, n=13), lower respiratory tract infection (n=7), pneumonia bacterial 
(n=6) and sinusitis (2).
In pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS), during the Overall Study Period, 105 infection 
AEs were reported in 23 patients (92%) of which the majority (96 out of 105 AEs [91%]) 
were reported to be non-serious.  Similar to the Remission Induction Phase, the most 
frequently reported infections during the overall study period were upper respiratory tract 
infections (12 patients [48%]) all of which were non-serious.
Pemphigus vulgaris
In Study ML22196, 3 patients (7.9%) from the rituximab + prednisone arm experienced 5 
serious infections.  In the prednisone arm, 1 patient (2.8%) experienced 1 serious 
infection.  The PTs for serious infections (rituximab + prednisone arm vs. prednisone) 
were pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (1 patient in each treatment arm), infective 
thrombosis (1 patient vs. 0 patients), intervertebral discitis (1 patient vs. 0 patients), lung 
infection (1 patient vs. 0 patients), and staphylococcal sepsis (1 patient vs. 0 patients). 
In Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX), in the rituximab arm 42 patients (62.7%) experienced 
74 infections. In the rituximab arm, infections reported in 5% of patients were upper 
respiratory tract infection (7 patients, 10.4%), nasopharyngitis and oral candidiasis (6 
patients each, 9.0%) and urinary tract infection (5 patients, 7.5%).
NHL/CLL
Serious Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with 
hematological malignancies and are a frequent complication of treatment. Infections are 
often severe, requiring rapid diagnosis and aggressive antibiotic treatment, and infection 
is often the ultimate cause of death in patients with refractory, progressive hematological 
malignancies such as CLL or NHL. 
Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
immunosuppressed patients, including cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, organ 
transplant recipients, and patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Reversibility: 
Infections are a frequent complication of treatment and major cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. Many infections occurring in 
immunocompromised patients can be cured, although opportunistic fungal and viral 
infections typically are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and may require 
long-term treatment to prevent relapse. The majority of infections occurring in patients 
receiving rituximab for RA and GPA/MPA are non-serious and are successfully cured 
with standard antiinfective agents (See further information in risks of PML). The extent of 
reversibility depends on the pathogen. Many infections caused by common respiratory 
and enteric viruses are likely to resolve completely without long-term sequelae, and 
require only supportive treatment. Others may require anti-viral therapy (e.g., HSV, 
CMV). Hematogenous bacterial and fungal infections require hospitalization and 
aggressive treatment, and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, 
although complete resolution can be expected in patients who survive. Some

233
opportunistic viral infections are irreversible. (See further information of risks of PML, 
Hepatitis B Reactivation).
Impact on quality of life:
Although the impact on patient quality of life depends on the specific pathogen, many 
infections in immunocompromised patients are life threatening or require prolonged 
hospitalization and anti-infective therapy. Serious viral infections like encephalitis can be 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Most opportunistic infections are 
associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.  Some are irreversible and/or 
associated with serious long-term sequelae, disability and dependence.  Depending on 
the seriousness of the infection, the increased chance of hospitalization and extended 
antibiotic therapy, the impact of infection on quality of life can be substantial.
Risk factors and risk groups:
RA, GPA/MPA, and PV
Patients with advanced RA are at a higher risk of infection than the general population 
largely because of altered immunological function or other factors such as decreased 
mobility, or therapies used to treat the underlying disease (steroids, immunomodulating 
agents) (Dixon et al. 2006). A retrospective cohort study found that the rate of infection 
in RA patients was higher than in patients without RA in each of the 11 infection 
categories examined; sites associated with the highest relative risk were joints, bone, 
skin and soft tissues (Dixon et al. 2006). The HR for the development of objectively 
confirmed infections in RA patients compared with non-RA patients, after adjustment for 
confounding variables, was 1.70. Within RA patients, increasing age, presence of 
extra-articular manifestations of RA, and co-morbidities, as well as use of 
corticosteroids, were strong predictors of infection risk. The predicting co-morbidities 
were chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, alcoholism, organic brain disease, 
and diabetes mellitus. Of the disease-modifying therapies examined, corticosteroids 
consistently increased infection risk.  In large studies, infection rates are clearly 
increased with cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, whereas MTX appears to be 
associated with minimal, if any, increased infection risk (McLean-Tooke A et al. 2009). 
Data about other DMARDs are scarce, and the main cause of therapy withdrawal is 
related to toxicity rather than infection (Iaccarino L et al. 2007). Anti-TNF-α agents like 
IFX are associated with an increased risk for TB, HBV reactivation and opportunistic 
infections (OIs), (Botsios 2005).
Risk factors for infection in GPA/MPA patients include the concomitant use of high dose 
corticosteroids and/or other immunomodulatory agents. 
No risk factors have been identified for PV patients.

NHL/CLL
No risk factors or risk groups have been identified specifically for rituximab and the risk 
of infection is closely related to concomitant chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying 
condition. In a retrospective analysis by (Bishop et al. 1981), a higher infection rate in 
NHL patients was associated with granulocytopenia and post splenectomy. The 
commonest sites of infection were lung, skin, and alimentary canal.  Risk factors for 
infections identified in the literature in patients with CLL include advanced disease stage, 
previous antineoplastic therapy, refractoriness to fludarabine-based therapy, high serum 
2-microglobulin level, low serum albumin level, low granulocyte count and high serum 
creatinine concentration (Anaissie et al. 1998).
The risk of serious viral infection/reactivation is mainly related to concomitant 
chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying condition.  Fludarabine in particular, has 
been associated with an increased risk of serious viral infections including CMV and JC 
virus/PML, and this is probably related to the induction of profound CD4+ lymphopenia.
The risk of developing PJP among HIV patients rises markedly when circulating CD4+ 
cell counts fall below 200/µL.  A low CD4+ count is likely to be a major risk factor for 
opportunistic infections in other patients including those receiving immunosuppressive 
therapy (particularly glucocorticoids) for hematological malignancies such as NHL or 
CLL.
Patients with CLL are predisposed to common as well as opportunistic infections as a 
result of a number of disease-related factors including immunoglobulin deficiency, 
abnormal T-cell function, and neutropenia resulting from infiltration of the bone marrow.
Preventability:
RA and GPA/MPA 
The MabThera SmPC includes information pertaining to minimizing the risk of infections.
Based on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B-cells play an 
important role in maintaining normal immune response, patients may have an increased 
risk of infection following rituximab therapy.  Serious infections, including fatalities, can 
occur during therapy with rituximab.  Rituximab should not be administered to patients 
with an active severe infection (e.g., tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections) or 
severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low).  
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious infection e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia.  It is 
recommended that immunoglobulin levels are determined prior to initiating treatment 
with MabThera.  Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended

for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis during and 
following rituximab treatment, as appropriate. 
Information to assist healthcare professionals and further inform patients on the risks of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and infections in RA and GPA/MPA 
has been developed as an additional risk minimization activity. These educational 
materials are intended for non-oncology indications.
NHL/CLL
The increased risk of infection associated specifically with administration of rituximab (if 
it occurs) cannot be prevented and no specific measures are recommended for rituximab 
itself.  Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active infection or 
severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low).  
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious infection.
Primary prophylaxis for PCP with cotrimoxazole and for viral infection with agents such 
as acyclovir is not generally indicated for patients with NHL or CLL treated with 
rituximab.  However, it may be indicated for the concomitant chemotherapy e.g., patients 
receiving fludarabine-based regimens (regardless of whether rituximab is given).
Patients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be 
promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of 
rituximab treatment, patients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. 
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious infection.
Indications for primary prophylaxis against opportunistic infections are not clear for 
patients with hematological malignancies, including patients with NHL or CLL treated 
with rituximab-containing regimens.  Primary prophylaxis (with 
trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole   antivirals) is probably indicated for patients receiving 
fludarabine-based regimens (regardless of whether rituximab is given).
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
No new aspects of the important identified risk Infections, including Serious Infections, 
has become available to the MAH in any indications to date. The benefit-risk profile of 
rituximab in the approved indications remains unchanged and favourable.

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 24.0 Terms (Roche “Risk 
PML” basket):
Potential mechanisms: 
Rituximab’s mechanism of action induces B-cell depletion that can lead to a depressed 
immune system. In addition, previous or concomitant immunotherapy, bone marrow 
infiltration, and/or corticotherapy might be important contributing factors of reactivation of 
latent John Cunningham (JC) virus.
Further for NHL/CLL, the underlying malignancy can also contribute to 
immunosuppression.

Characterization of the risk:
Frequency with 95%:
RA
Confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is very rare 
(< 1/10,000 patients) in patients receiving rituximab for the treatment of RA, based on all 
data from clinical and postmarketing experience. The cumulative (cutoff 17 November 
2020) reporting rate of 20 confirmed PML cases in patients treated with rituximab for RA 
is 2.06 per 100,000 unique patients (RA exposure ~ 969,416)). Eleven out of the 20 
confirmed cases of PML resulted in fatal outcome.
GPA/MPA
Confirmed PML is very rare (< 1/10,000) in patients receiving rituximab for the treatment 
of GPA/ MPA. In the cumulative period until 17 November 2020, an estimation of 96,653
patients were exposed to rituximab in GPA/MPA, and only 5 confirmed PML cases in 
GPA/MPA were reported.
No events of PML were reported in studies WA27893 and ML22514, in DSR 1081144, 
and in pediatric Study WA25615.
Pemphigus vulgaris:
No events of PML were reported until 17 November 2020.
NHL/CLL
The reporting rate of PML in oncology indications (confirmed and unconfirmed) is around 
6.7/100,000 (390/5,757,196) patient exposures and remains very rare to rare, based on 
post-marketing experience and clinical trial data.

Severity and nature of risk:
PML is a rare progressive subacute-demyelinating disorder of the central nervous 
system (CNS) usually leading to death or severe disability. The severity of the PML was 
not reported in the majority of cases. 
The majority of patients with a diagnosis of PML after treatment with rituximab (across all 
indications), had not recovered at the time of reporting. Only in a few cases, the PML 
was “resolving” at the time of the last report.
Seriousness/ Outcomes:
A cumulative multiaxial search of PML events and PML confirmatory tests was carried 
out covering all the data for rituximab in the company safety database ARISg up to the 
cutoff date 17 November 2020.
RA
As of 17 November 2020, 20 cases of confirmed PML have been reported in patients 
treated for RA, of which 11 cases had a fatal outcome. Fourteen out of 20 confirmed 
cases reported in RA were reported in female patients, which is representative of the 
autoimmune patient population. Of the 20 confirmed PML cases, 14 patients had 
significant known risk factors for PML. All 14 patients had received significant prior 
and/or concomitant immunosuppressant therapy including disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drug (DMARDS) and TNF inhibitors; 1 patient had a history of 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) treated with chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy; 1 patient had a history of breast cancer.  Additionally, 4 patients had Sjögren’s 
syndrome, 2 patients had documented lymphopenia and 2 patients had IRIS.
GPA/MPA
As of 17 November 2018, 4 cases of confirmed PML have been reported in patients with 
GPA/MPA. In the first confirmed PML case the patient had signs of PML prior to the start 
of rituximab.  In addition, this patient had a medical history of breast cancer and also had 
received significant prior and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy including 
cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil, methotrexate, azathioprine and prednisolone. 
In the second confirmed PML case, the patient had significant known risk factors for 
PML including steroids and immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine and 
cyclophosphamide). In the third confirmed PML case, the potential risk factors include 
concomitant medication (prednisone) and condition (polyarthralgia). In the fourth case, 
the potential risk factors include concomitant medication (prednisone) and condition 
(polyarthralgia).

NHL/CLL
As of 17 November 2020, 260 cases of confirmed PML have been reported in patients 
treated for underlying NHL, of which 140 cases have thus far had a fatal outcome.  Also, 
130 cases of confirmed PML have been reported in patients treated for underlying CLL, 
of which 63 cases have thus far had a fatal outcome.
The majority of the patients who developed PML under rituximab therapy for NHL 
indications were receiving concomitant cytotoxic chemotherapy (predominantly CHOP).  
In a few cases, the information regarding concomitant chemotherapy was not reported.  
The patients also had pertinent alternative causes (past medical history like HIV, IRIS, 
Sjögren’s syndrome, past drugs and concomitant drugs like chlorambucil, fludarabine, 
steroids) of underlying immunosuppression.
The majority of the patients who developed PML under rituximab therapy for CLL 
indications were receiving concomitant cytotoxic chemotherapy (predominantly 
fludarabine) or were immunosuppressed intentionally following stem cell transplant.  In 
addition, the majority of the patients were receiving steroids. In a few cases, the 
information regarding concomitant chemotherapy was not reported.  The patients also 
had pertinent alternative causes of underlying immunosuppression.
Reversibility: 
There is currently no treatment available for PML, although disease progression has 
been slowed or halted in some patients by withdrawal of treatment.
Impact on quality of life:
PML causes gradual, progressive CNS demyelination, multifocal neurological deficit, and 
death, usually within 1 year. Hence, the impact on quality of life is very substantial.
Risk factors and risk groups:
RA
PML has been reported in patients with autoimmune diseases including Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus(SLE) and RA who have received immunosuppressive agents.
GPA/MPA
Cyclophosphamide is a risk factor for development of PML in GPA/MPA patients.

NHL/CLL
PML almost exclusively occurs in immunocompromised patients. It may occur in patients 
with deficits in the humoral and/or cellular immune response such as lymphoproliferative 
diseases, myeloproliferative diseases, carcinomatous diseases and acquired
immunodeficiency due to autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive therapy. 
Fludarabine has been associated with an increased risk, possibly related to the induction 
a profound CD4+ lymphopenia.
A close evaluation of rituximab associated cases of PML found that most cases occurred 
in individuals with a well-known concomitant risk of PML such as prior or concurrent 
exposure to a recognized immunosuppressant.  In NHL/CLL, PML occurred at any time 
after rituximab treatment. although after 12-24 months the frequency of PML was lower 
(DSR 1081270; dated 28 June 2017).
Preventability:
There are no approved treatments available to prevent, retard, stop, or reverse the 
disease once established in patients.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
No new aspects of the important identified risk PML have become available to the MAH 
in any indications to date. The benefit-risk profile of rituximab in the approved indications 
remains unchanged and favourable.
Public health impact:
RA, GPA/MPA and PV
Limited public health impact in view of the population treated and the limitations placed 
upon administration of rituximab by virtue of the warnings and precautions and its 
formulation.  Use outside of controlled environments by non-Healthcare professionals is 
not anticipated.  The MAH continues to monitor for any such occurrences.
NHL/CLL
None. There is no reason to suppose that PML occurring in a patient receiving rituximab 
would have any public health implications since JC virus infection is ubiquitous and the 
disease is caused by reactivation of a latent form.

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 24.0: Roche “Risk 
Hepatitis B reactivation” basket.
Potential mechanisms: 
Rituximab’s mechanism of action induces B-cell depletion; B cells play a key role in the 
multiple immune responses against HBV. Besides neutralizing antibodies, it is an 
antigen presenting cell and enhances the cytotoxic response of CD8 T lymphocytes. The 
control of HBV infection is mediated mainly by HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes; 
nevertheless, B lymphocytes are still essential for antigen presentation. The failure in 
antigen presentation related to the prolonged depletion of B cells by rituximab may allow 
the HBV to escape the cytotoxic T lymphocyte control, hence leading to development of 
viral hepatitis replication and reactivation. Furthermore, association with previous or 
concomitant immunotherapy, bone marrow infiltration, and/or corticotherapy might also 
alter the patient’s immune system and be important factors contributing to hepatitis B 
reactivation.

Taking into account the exposure (till 20 August 2012) for rituximab in hematological 
malignancies (2,766,982); the crude reporting rate for HBV reactivation in rituximab 
treated patients is 0.016% (443 cases).
The majority of these occurred in patients receiving rituximab in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. The reports were confounded by both the underlying disease 
state and the cytotoxic chemotherapy and blood transfusions received.
Pediatric B-NHL (BO25380):
No events of hepatitis B reactivation were reported at the time of the primary analysis.
Severity and nature of risk:
RA
Patients seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were excluded from the 
clinical trial protocols. However, the clinical trial All Exposure population included 131 
patients who, at screening, were seronegative for HBsAg but seropositive for hepatitis B 
core antibody (HBcAb), indicating prior exposure to viral hepatitis B. Hepatitis B viral 
loads (as measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in these patients were 
monitored regularly for evidence of re-activation. As of 30 September 2012, a total of 5 
HBcAb seropositive patients had experienced small and transient increases in viral load 
(HBV DNA).  No increases were accompanied by laboratory or clinical consequences 
and no anti-viral therapies were initiated. Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), and liver function test abnormalities were consistent with those in the All 
Exposure population, and there were no liver-related SAEs. Consequently, there were 
no cases of clinical reactivation reported in clinical trials.
GPA/MPA
Patients with a previous documented history of hepatitis B were excluded from RAVE. 
No cases of hepatitis viral reactivation were reported in the RAVE, RaVeR, 
MAINRITSAN studies, in pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS) and in DSR 1081144. 
Pemphigus vulgaris:
No information available.
NHL/CLL
Exacerbations of hepatitis in a chronic hepatitis B carrier may occur because of 
hepatitis B reactivation, superinfection with delta hepatitis virus (HDV) or a mutant HBV

NHL/CLL
Reactivation of hepatitis B ranges from asymptomatic reactivations (detected by 
changes in laboratory parameters only) to fulminant liver failure and death. Of the 443 
cases analyzed in Drug Safety Report 1053039 (dated 15 April 2013), the outcome of 
HBV reactivation was fatal in 30% of the cases (132 case reports).
Pediatric B-NHL (BO25380).
No events of hepatitis B reactivation were reported at the time of the primary analysis.
Reversibility:
Mortality is high, despite treatment, although prognosis is improved by early detection 
and treatment.
Impact on quality of life:
Manifestations of hepatitis reactivation can range from subclinical to severe or fatal 
hepatitis. In most cases, the impact in patient quality of life is substantial. Many patients 
require hospitalization and/or long term treatment.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy for defined periods of time for 
hematological, oncological or rheumatological diseases and as long term prophylaxis

after bone marrow or solid organ transplantation are at an increased risk for HBV re-
activation (Calabrese et al. 2007).
NHL/CLL only
HBV reactivation is a well-documented complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy in 
patients with cancer. Pre-treatment liver function tests and HBV DNA levels have been 
shown not to correlate with the risk of subsequent development of HBV reactivation. 
However, male sex, younger age, HBeAg seropositivity, and diagnosis of lymphoma 
have been reported as risk factors for reactivation. Severe reactivation also appears 
more likely when the chemotherapy is significantly immunosuppressive, when the viral 
load is high, and in the presence of precore mutant variant of HBV.
Preventability:
The majority of patients treated with rituximab are likely to receive additional 
immunosuppressive therapy and/or steroids. Thus, it is recommended that HBV 
screening occurs in all patients before the initiation of treatment with rituximab for all 
indications, and that patients with positive serology (i.e., carriers of hepatitis B 
[HBsAg+ve] and patients with HBsAg-ve and HBcAb+ve status) should consult with a 
liver disease specialist before start of treatment. Those patients should be monitored 
and managed following local standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. This wording 
is reflected in the rituximab core data sheet (CDS).
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
No new aspects of the important identified risk Hepatitis B Reactivation have become 
available to the MAH in any indications to date. The benefit-risk profile of rituximab in the

Day 1 baseline few patients (  2.2%) had total immunoglobulin (Ig), immunoglobulin A 
(IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), or immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentrations below the 
lower limit of normal [LLN] (refer to Table 24). After rituximab treatment (post 
baseline)   3.9% had IgA or total Ig levels below LLN at any time, while 14.8% had IgG 
levels   LLN and 37.9% had IgM levels   LLN at any time. The proportion of patients 
with levels of IgM and IgG below LLN increased over time compared with the proportions 
in the first rituximab course.

In the rituximab arm of the RAVE study 50.7% had newly occurring IgM   LLN and 
58.0% had newly occurring IgG   LLN at 6 months. These numbers were comparable to 
the CYC (cyclophosphamide) arm.
No events of hypogammaglobulinaemia were reported in adult Study ML22514 
(MAINRITSAN).  No data were available from Study WA27893 (RaVeR) in adults, as 
immunoglobulin levels were not collected in the study.  In the clinical pediatric Study

Severity and nature of risk:
RA
Hypogammaglobulinemia is a clinical-laboratory entity with varied causes and 
manifestations related to deficiencies of humoral immunity. A clinical feature of 
hypogammaglobulinemia relates to predisposition toward infections, which normally are 
defended against by antibody responses.
As rituximab targets CD20 expressing cells, including B cells and stimulated, 
undifferentiated plasma cells, a decline in IgM levels is observed in the all exposure 
population. It has been postulated that if B-cell depletion continues beyond the lifetime of 
plasma cells, drops in IgG levels could occur due to depletion of IgG producing plasma 
cells resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia, however an analysis by van Vollenhoven’s of 
5000+ patient years of rituximab exposure found that the proportion of patients with 
IgG   LLN by course remained relatively stable, with 3%–6%   LLN (van Vollenhoven 
et al. 2010). 
No clear baseline demographic or disease characteristics could be identified to 
potentially predict occurrence of low Ig concentrations for at least 4 months.

GPA/MPA
In RAVE, a single course of rituximab appeared to have a comparable effect on 
immunoglobulins to 6 months induction treatment with CYC. Median changes from 
baseline in Ig concentrations were similar in the rituximab and CYC groups at 6 months, 
with numerically greater decreases in IgM and IgG at 18 months in the rituximab than in 
the CYC group. The clinical consequences of hypogammaglobulinemia were evaluated 
by comparison of infections rates in patients with and without low Ig. Rates of overall and 
serious infections appeared similar in patients with low Ig at any time compared to those 
with normal Ig levels, however the number of patients contributing to comparison was 
too small to provide definitive conclusions.
In DSR 1078506, from the 68 reported cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia, 42 cases 
also reported 70 events of infection. Lab values were not available in most of the cases.
In the pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS), three patients had AEs of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia reported, and all of them received treatment with IV Ig. All 
3 patients had both prolonged low IgG and IgM levels during the study.
Pemphigus Vulgaris:
In Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX), in the rituximab arm, one patient with low baseline IgG 
and IgM levels experienced a serious skin infection (onset Day 8; Grade 3, unrelated, 
seriousness criterion – hospitalization, resolved with treatment). No serious infections 
occurred in the other patients with low Ig levels.
Seriousness/ Outcomes:
RA
In the All Exposure RA population (cutoff date, September 2012), low Ig concentrations
(particularly IgM, less often IgG) were observed following rituximab treatment.  For both 
IgM and IgG, serious infection events (SIEs) rates per 100 patient-year were similar 
before (IgM, 2.80 [95% CI: 2.09;3.75]; IgG, 6.75 [95% CI: 4.48;10.15]) and during/after 
development of low Ig (IgM, 3.84 [95% CI: 3.20;4.62]; IgG, 8.16 [95% CI: 5.86;11.36]).  
These SIEs rates in patients who developed low IgG levels were higher than 
corresponding rates in patients who never developed low IgG, both before and after 
development of low IgG levels. This suggests that these patients may have a higher 
inherent risk of developing SIEs. The serious infection profile of patients who had low 
IgG or IgM for   4 months was similar to that of the All Exposure population. The 
majority of serious infections in these patients were of bacterial origin.

There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections after the 
development of low IgG or IgM, however, the number of patients with granulomatosis

definitive conclusions.
In the pediatric Study WA25615 (PePRS), there was a decrease in IgA, IgG, IgM and 
total immunoglobulin concentrations from baseline over the course of the study.  
Although a decrease was observed, median IgA levels remained within the normal 
laboratory reference ranges throughout the study.
Pemphigus Vulgaris:
In Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX), in the rituximab arm, one patient with low baseline IgG

occurred in the other patients with low Ig levels.
Reversibility:
Hypogammaglobulinemia can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulins.
Impact on quality of life:
Hypogammaglobulinemia itself is asymptomatic, but may predispose the patient to 
certain infections. Impact on the quality of life is variable, depending on whether the 
patient suffers from infections, and on the type of infections that occur.

SVII.3.1.2 INFORMATION ON IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISKS
SVII.3.1.2.1 OFF-LABEL USE OF THE SUBCUTANEOUS FORMULATION 
(NHL/CLL, SC FORMULATIONS)
Potential mechanisms:
The SC formulation may be regarded by patients and physicians as a convenient 
alternative to IV infusion for patients with autoimmune diseases (RA and GPA/MPA), 
and potentially also for those with diseases that are not approved indications for 
rituximab IV. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
The subcutaneous formulation has only been studied in adult NHL and CLL populations 
as stated in the EU SmPC. 
The potential risk is being monitored via routine pharmacovigilance activities to 
characterize off-label use of the subcutaneous formulation including the adverse 
reactions specific to the use of this formulation in unapproved indications. 
Till now only few cases have been reported where SC formulation has been used for off 
label indication with no new safety concern.
Characterization of the risk:
Frequency with 95% Confidence Interval (CI): No data available
Seriousness: No data available
Severity: No data available
Impact on quality of life
The risks (i.e., AEs) that could theoretically be associated with off-label use of the SC 
formulation may be considered broadly as (i) risks associated with off-label use of 
rituximab generally (irrespective of the formulation), and (ii) additional risks that could be 
related to use of the SC formulation in conditions for which only the IV formulation is 
currently approved (RA and GPA/MPA). The approved dose for RA is 1000 mg IV (fixed 
dose) every two weeks (q2w) x2, and the approved dose for GPA/MPA is 375 mg/m2 IV 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 24.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
rituximab

of
233
weekly (q1w) x4. It should be taken into note that approved SC dose was developed to 
match the existing doses in NHL and CLL 375mg/m2 and 500mg/m2 respectively and 
thus for RA there is a risk of underdosing and for GPA/MPA, though the dose is similar it 
has not been studied. The potential for harm in each instance of off-label use of the SC 
formulation would depend on the dose and dose-interval used. For example, it is 
conceivable that prescribers could modify the SC dose and/or dose interval that is 
currently recommended for treatment of patients with NHL or CLL, or alternatively may 
administer the fixed-dose 1400 mg SC formulation or fixed-dose 1600 mg SC 
formulation without regard to the special dosage requirements of the target disease (i.e., 
in AI indications for which rituximab IV is approved). Hence, off-label use of the SC 
formulation in AI indications for which only the IV formulation is approved, could 
plausibly result in relative under- or over-dosing, and could therefore affect the benefit-
risk profile of rituximab.
Risk factors and risk groups:
The risks that could be associated with off-label use of the SC formulation also depends 
on whether the SC formulation is being used for treating a condition for which the 
rituximab IV formulation is approved (e.g., autoimmune diseases), or diseases for which 
rituximab IV formulation is also not approved. 
Preventability:
Off-label use is not fully preventable, even with adequate knowledge among healthcare 
professionals and patients concerning the approved indications. Hence, the burden of 
morbidity associated with off-label use, and the extent to which this can be reduced by 
providing information to healthcare professionals, are uncertain.

Educational interventions aimed at healthcare professionals focus on the different 
dose and dose intervals needed to achieve efficacy for various indications for which 
rituximab is approved. 
Information on the approved therapeutic indications is provided in a separate SmPC 
and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for each formulation.

SVII.3.1.2.2 ADMINISTRATION ROUTE ERROR (NHL/CLL, SC 
FORMULATIONS)
Potential mechanisms: 
Accidental IV administration of the SC formulation would result in systemic exposure to 
rHuPH20, and could also result in faster rate of rituximab infusion and/or overdose, due 
to the high concentration of rituximab in the SC formulation, depending on how the 
infusion rate was calculated by the person responsible. A faster rate of infusion could 
increase the risk of infusion-related reactions which is an important identified risk.  
Rituximab should be administered only in a setting where experienced personnel and 
resuscitation facilities are available.  Hence, facilities for the emergency treatment of 
events caused by a fast rate of infusion would always be available, if such events 
occurred.
Accidental SC administration of the IV formulation is unlikely to occur without detection, 
as injection of a large volume (e.g., one vial of the 100 mg/10mL IV formulation) in the 
absence of rHuPH20 would be difficult. Such an error, if it occurred, would not pose an 
immediate risk to the patient, as the IV formulation has a lower concentration of 
rituximab than the SC formulation. However, the patient would receive an ineffective 
dose of rituximab if the error were not detected at the time.

Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
Pre-clinical data
Toxicology studies in animals have shown that IV doses of rHuPH20 of greater than 
5mg/kg are tolerated without acute harmful effects. Given these findings, acute toxicity 
from rHuPH20 after IV administration of the SC formulation is not expected in humans.
Clinical data:
During the rituximab SC clinical development program, three patients randomized to the 
rituximab IV arm were inadvertently administered rituximab SC solution through the 
intravenous (IV) route. No untoward events were observed in any patient.
Two patients randomized to the SC arm were inadvertently administered rituximab IV via

Risk factors and risk groups:
Administration route error could result from accidental substitution of the SC and IV 
formulations (e.g., an error in the hospital pharmacy), or incorrect injection technique 
when using the SC formulation (e.g., placement of the needle directly into a vein or 
muscle).
11 It should be noted that the presentation of SC and IV vials used in the clinical trials was different from that 
available commercially. The vials available in the market contain number of safety measures to avoid the 
potential risk of administration route error

Routine risk communication is mentioned in the EU SmPC Section 1: Name of the 
Medicinal Product and section 4.2: Posology and method of administration.
Educational material for healthcare professionals are used to minimize the risks of 
administration route error. Please refer to Part V.1 and V.2 for additional details.
Rituximab should be administered only in a setting where experienced personnel 
and resuscitation facilities are available (EU SmPC section 4.2: Posology and 
method of administration). Hence, facilities for the emergency treatment of events 
caused by a fast rate of infusion would always be available, if such events occurred.
As an additional package differentiation, a peel-off sticker is included on the 
individual SC vials specifying the strength, the route of administration and the 
indication. The sticker aims to allow the nurses/healthcare professionals to clearly 
identify the content of the syringe, and would maintain beginning to end of the chain 
(administration to patient) traceability to further minimize the risk of medication 
errors.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
No new aspects of the important potential risk Administration route error have become 
available to the MAH to date. The benefit-risk profile of rituximab SC formulation in the 
approved NHL and CLL indications remains unchanged and favourable.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES)
III.1 ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting 
and signal detection:
A specific adverse reaction guided questionnaire for continuous monitoring of the safety 
concern is employed for the following risks:
 PML (All indications) – as well to enhance pharmacovigilance measures to expedite 
all cases of PML to RA.
 Off-label use in pediatric patients (All indications).
 Malignant events (non-oncology indications) and Second malignancies (NHL/CLL)
The forms are provided in Annex 4 of the RMP.
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for pregnancy and/or 
breastfeeding:
The Roche standard pregnancy follow-up process was implemented for all products to 
request additional information on the medication history of the exposed parent, relevant 
medical history for the mother and father, previous obstetric history, the current 
pregnancy, fetal and infant conditions, and results of tests and investigations for any 
pregnancy complication or congenital abnormality during pregnancy or within the first 
year of the infant’s life.
Cumulative data will be presented in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs)/PBRERs.
III.2 ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
There are no additional pharmacovigilance activities for MabThera.
Routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered by the MAH/Applicant to be 
sufficient to obtain and analyse relevant post-marketing safety data for all safety 
concerns with the aim to fully assess the safety of the product.

Objectives
Educational Material for Healthcare Professionals and 
Educational Material for Patients (non-oncology indications)
The educational materials are intended to inform and assist 
healthcare professionals (HCPs) in communicating key safety 
messages to patients or their parents receiving rituximab, and to 
provide patients with important safety information. The objective is 
to ensure that patients seek medical attention early to facilitate 
timely diagnosis of infections, and that the HCP are aware of the 
need for timely and appropriate measures.
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimization activity
The rationale is that with timely diagnosis of infections, continued 
treatment with MabThera can be evaluated and reductions or 
discontinuation of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
considered

Outcome indicator:
Given the very low incidence of PML, and given that the purpose of 
the education material is to raise awareness of PML among patients 
and physicians, to encourage early recognition and diagnosis, it is 
not possible to directly measure whether the material has an effect 
on patient outcome.
Criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk minimization

Objectives
Educational Material for Healthcare Professionals
To further emphasize that the 1400mg SC formulation is only for 
use in NHL populations and the 1600mg SC formulation is only for 
use in CLL populations as indicated in the relevant SmPCs. 
Educational material is deemed necessary to instruct healthcare 
professionals on correct injection technique. Hence, using this as a 
medium to also warn against off-label use imposes a minor 
additional burden on the healthcare professionals.
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimization activity
Educational material illustrates the differences between SC and IV 
formulations.
The anticipated impact is educational – to improve prescriber 
awareness of the risk of off label use with subcutaneous rituximab.
Target audience and 
planned distribution 
path
Healthcare professionals
Educational material to be distributed directly to health care 
professionals via national routes.
Plans for evaluating 
the effectiveness of 
the interventions and 
criteria for success
How effectiveness of risk minimization measures for the safety 
concern will be measured: Effectiveness is assessed using both 
process and outcome indicators. 
Process indicator:

Outcome indicator:
The extent of off-label use, as evident in the literature and/or 
inferred from the rate of adverse event reports in association with 
off-label use
Criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk minimization 
measures: Criteria for judging success depend upon the extent of 
off-label use as determined by the indicators described above, and 
harms that appear to be associated with off-label use.
Planned dates for assessment:

Educational Materials for Healthcare Professionals
The objective is to educate healthcare professionals about use of 
the SC formulation, to reduce the likelihood of accidental product 
substitution and ensure that the SC formulation is injected correctly.
The educational material comprises of a comparison card which 
focuses on package differentiation, and step by step guide which 
aims to educate on correct injection technique. 
Both educational strategies reinforce that the SC formulation is not 
to be self-administered and will advocate for its safe and optimized 
use according to the approved prescribing information.
The anticipated impact is educational – to improve prescriber 
awareness of the risk of administration error between subcutaneous 
and intravenous rituximab formulations.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR MABTHERA
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for MabThera.  The RMP details 
important risks of MabThera, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about MabThera risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
MabThera summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how MabThera should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for MabThera should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
MabThera RMP.
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
MabThera is authorized for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (SC and IV), 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (SC and IV) (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains Rituximab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous and 
intravenous route.
Further information about the evaluation of MabThera benefits can be found in 
MabThera EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS
Important risks of MabThera, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about MabThera risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:



Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 24.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
rituximab
144
of
233

The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of MabThera, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate
action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of MabThera is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing Information’ below.
II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION
Important risks of MabThera are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of MabThera.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

RA, GPA/MPA, PV
Patients with advanced RA are at a higher risk of infection 
than the general population largely because of altered 
immunological function or other factors such as decreased 
mobility, or therapies used to treat the underlying disease 
(steroids, immunomodulating agents) (Dixon et al. 2006). A 
retrospective cohort study found that the rate of infection in 
RA patients was higher than in patients without RA in each of 
the 11 infection categories examined; sites associated with the 
highest relative risk were joints, bone, skin and soft tissues 
(Dixon et al. 2006). 
Risk factors for infection in GPA/MPA patients include the 
concomitant use of high dose corticosteroids and/or other 
immunomodulatory agents. 
No risk factors have been identified for PV patients.
NHL/CLL
No risk factors or risk groups have been identified specifically 
for rituximab and the risk of infection is closely related to 
concomitant chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying 
condition.

NHL/CLL
PML almost exclusively occurs in immunocompromised 
patients. It may occur in patients with deficits in the humoral 
and/or cellular immune response such as lymphoproliferative 
diseases, myeloproliferative diseases, carcinomatous 
diseases and acquired immunodeficiency due to autoimmune 
diseases and immunosuppressive therapy. Fludarabine has 
been associated with an increased risk, possibly related to the 
induction a profound CD4+ lymphopenia
Routine risk communication:
EU SmPC section 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for 
use
Routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk:
Patients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be 
suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must 
be suspended until PML has been excluded. Further 
evaluations, includes MRI scan preferably with contrast, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat 
neurological assessments, should be considered. If a patient 
develops PML, the dosing of MabThera must be permanently 
discontinued.

HBV reactivation is a well-documented complication of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with cancer. Pre-treatment 
liver function tests and HBV DNA levels have been shown not 
to correlate with the risk of subsequent development of HBV 
reactivation. However, male sex, younger age, HBeAg 
seropositivity, and diagnosis of lymphoma have been reported 
as risk factors for reactivation. Severe reactivation also 
appears more likely when the chemotherapy is significantly 
immunosuppressive, when the viral load is high, and in the 
presence of precore mutant variant of HBV.
Risk minimization
measures
Routine risk communication:
EU SmPC section 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for 
use
Routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk:
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all 
patients before initiation of treatment with MabThera. At 
minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. 
These can be complemented with other appropriate markers 
as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease 
should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with positive 
hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult
liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be 
monitored and managed following local medical standards to 
prevent hepatitis B reactivation.

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
The subcutaneous formulation has only been studied in NHL 
and CLL populations as stated in the EU SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization
measures
The potential risk is being monitored via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities to characterize off-label use of the 
subcutaneous formulation including the adverse reactions 
specific to the use of this formulation in unapproved 
indications. 
Until now only few cases have been reported where SC 
formulation has been used for off label indication with no new 
safety concern.
The risks that could be associated with off-label use of the SC 
formulation also depends on whether the SC formulation is 
being used for treating a condition for which the rituximab IV 
formulation is approved (e.g., autoimmune diseases), or 
diseases for which rituximab IV formulation is also not 
approved. Furthermore, off-label use is not fully preventable, 
even with adequate knowledge among healthcare 
professionals and patients concerning the approved 
indications.

measures
Pre-clinical data
Toxicology studies in animals have shown that IV doses of 
rHuPH20 of greater than 5mg/kg are tolerated without acute 
harmful effects. Given these findings, acute toxicity from 
rHuPH20 after IV administration of the SC formulation is not 
expected in humans.
Clinical data:
During the rituximab SC clinical development program, three 
patients randomized to the rituximab IV arm were inadvertently 
administered rituximab SC solution through the intravenous 
(IV) route. No untoward events were observed in any patient.
The three patients seem to have tolerated this overdose via 
the IV route, as a result of accidental substitution of IV vials by 
SC vials, without any untoward events. There have been no 
other known cases of measurable plasma concentrations of 
rHuPH20 following SC injection in humans or through direct 
intravenous administration of rHuPH20.
Two patients randomized to the SC arm were inadvertently 
administered rituximab IV via subcutaneous route. No adverse 
events were associated with error in these patients and 
remained in the study.12. 
Safety data:
The reporting rate of administration route error is low.  As per 
the 2017  PBRER (1081698), no serious AEs have been 
reported as a result of administration route error with 
Rituximab IV/SC. 
Administration route error could result from accidental 
substitution of the SC and IV formulations (e.g., an error in the 
hospital pharmacy), or incorrect injection technique when 
using the SC formulation (e.g., placement of the needle 
directly into a vein or muscle).
Routine risk communication:
The IV and SC formulations are covered by separate EU 
SmPCs to reinforce the difference between the IV and SC 
formulations.

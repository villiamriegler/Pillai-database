White powder in a light grey inhaler (Ellipta) with a beige mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Elebrato Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled 
corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting β2-agonist and a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The recommended and maximum dose is one inhalation once daily, each day at the same time. 
If a dose is missed the next dose should be inhaled at the usual time the next day. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Elebrato 
Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Elebrato Ellipta in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the 
indication of COPD. 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use only. 
Instructions for use: 
The following instructions for the 30 dose (30 day supply) inhaler also apply to the 14 dose (14 day supply) 
inhaler. 
a) 
Prepare a dose 
Open the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. 
Slide the cover down fully until a “click” is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the “click” is 
heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. 
b) 
How to inhale the medicinal product 
The inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable, but not breathing out 
into the inhaler. 
The mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. The 
air vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. 
• 
• 
• 
Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible (at 
least 3-4 seconds). 
Remove the inhaler from the mouth. 
Breathe out slowly and gently. 
The medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. 
The mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. 
c) 
Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth 
Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. 
Rinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow.  
This will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects. 
For further instructions on handling the device, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Asthma  
This medicinal product should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient 
population. 
Not for acute use 
There are no clinical data to support the use of Elebrato Ellipta for the treatment of acute episodes of 
bronchospasm, or to treat an acute COPD exacerbation (i.e. as a rescue therapy). 
Deterioration of disease 
Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms may indicate deterioration of disease 
control. In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with Elebrato Ellipta, a re-evaluation of the 
patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken. 
Patients should not stop therapy with Elebrato Ellipta without physician supervision since symptoms may 
recur after discontinuation. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol may produce paradoxical bronchospasm with 
an immediate wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing and may be life-threatening. If paradoxical 
bronchospasm occurs, treatment should be discontinued immediately. The patient should be assessed and 
alternative therapy instituted if necessary. 
Cardiovascular effects  
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after 
the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including umeclidinium and 
vilanterol, respectively (see section 4.8). Therefore, Elebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients 
with unstable or life-threatening cardiovascular disease. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment receiving Elebrato Ellipta should be monitored for 
systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 5.2). 
Systemic corticosteroid effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long 
periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids.  
Visual disturbance  
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with 
symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to 
an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases 
such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical 
corticosteroids. 
Coexisting conditions  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in 
patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Elebrato Ellipta should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients 
with chronic or untreated infections. 
Anticholinergic activity 
Elebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Patients should be 
informed about the signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma and should be informed to stop 
using Elebrato Ellipta and to contact their doctor immediately should any of these signs or symptoms 
develop. 
Caution should be advised when prescribing Elebrato Ellipta in patients with urinary retention or risk factors 
for urinary retention, e.g. benign prostatic hypertrophy. Cases of acute urinary retention have been observed 
in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). 
Pneumonia in patients with COPD 
An increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been 
observed in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an increased 
risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all 
studies. 
There is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk 
among inhaled corticosteroid products. 
Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the 
clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. 
Risk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass index 
(BMI) and severe COPD. 
Hypokalaemia 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to 
produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring 
supplementation.  
No clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with Elebrato Ellipta at the 
recommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when Elebrato Ellipta is used with other 
medicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia (see section 4.5). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycaemia in some patients. No clinically relevant 
effects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 
at the recommended therapeutic dose. There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in 
diabetic patients treated with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol and this should be considered when 
prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus (see section 4.8). Upon initiation of treatment with 
Elebrato Ellipta, plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients. 
Excipients  
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol at clinical 
doses are considered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Interaction with beta-blockers 
Beta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as 
vilanterol. If beta-blockers are required, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, however, 
caution should be exercised during concurrent use of both non-selective and selective beta-blockers. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitor 
Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by enzyme 
CYP3A4. 
Caution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, 
cobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both fluticasone 
furoate and vilanterol, which could lead to an increased potential for adverse reactions. Co-administration 
should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid adverse 
reactions, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions. A repeat 
dose study was performed in healthy subjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination 
(184/22 micrograms) and ketoconazole (400 milligrams, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Co-administration 
increased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 36% and 33%, respectively. The increase in 
fluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum 
cortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax by 65% and 22%, respectively. The 
increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta2-agonist related systemic effects 
on heart rate or blood potassium. 
Interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors/CYP2D6 polymorphism 
Umeclidinium is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
umeclidinium was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect on 
umeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a dose 8-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. An 
approximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed at 16-fold higher dose with no effect on 
umeclidinium Cmax. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is 
expected when fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or 
when administered to patients who are genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). 
Interaction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). The 
effect of the moderate P-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
umeclidinium and vilanterol was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on 
umeclidinium or vilanterol Cmax. An approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed 
with no effect on vilanterol AUC. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug 
interaction is expected when fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with P-gp 
inhibitors. Clinical pharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have not been 
conducted. 
Other long acting antimuscarinics and long acting beta2- adrenergic agonists 
Co-administration of Elebrato Ellipta with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists or long-acting beta2- 
adrenergic agonists has not been studied and is not recommended as it may potentiate the adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.8 and 4.9).

Hypokalaemia 
Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-sparing 
diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution 
should be exercised (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see 
section 5.3). 
Administration of Elebrato Ellipta to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to 
the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, vilanterol or their metabolites are excreted in 
human milk.  However, other corticosteroids, muscarinic antagonists and beta2-adrenergic agonists are 
detected in human milk.  A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  A decision must be made whether 
to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Elebrato Ellipta therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol on human fertility.  Animal 
studies indicate no effects of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol on male or female fertility (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Pneumonia  
In a total of 1 810 patients with advanced COPD (mean post bronchodilatory screening FEV1 45% of 
predicted, standard deviation (SD) 13%), 65% of whom had experienced a moderate/severe COPD 
exacerbation in the year prior to study entry (study CTT116853), there was a higher incidence of pneumonia 
events reported up to 24 weeks in patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta (20 patients, 2%) than in patients 
receiving budesonide/formoterol (7 patients, <1%).  Pneumonia which required hospitalisation occurred in 
1% of patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta and <1% of patients receiving budesonide/formoterol up to 24 
weeks. One fatal case of pneumonia was reported in a patient who received Elebrato Ellipta. In the subset of 
430 patients treated for up to 52 weeks, the incidence of pneumonia events reported in both Elebrato Ellipta 
and budesonide/formoterol arms was equal at 2%. The incidence of pneumonia with Elebrato Ellipta is 
8 
 
 
 
 
comparable with that observed in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 arm of FF/VI clinical 
studies in COPD. 
In a 52-week study, with a total of 10 355 patients with COPD and a history of moderate or severe 
exacerbations within the prior 12 months (mean post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 46% of predicted, SD 
15%) (study CTT116855), the incidence of pneumonia was 8% (317 patients) for Elebrato Ellipta 
(n = 4 151), 7% (292 subjects) for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (n = 4 134), and 5% (97 subjects) for 
umeclidinium/vilanterol (n = 2 070). Fatal pneumonia occurred in 12 of 4 151 patients (3.5 per 1 000 patient-
years) receiving Elebrato Ellipta, 5 of 4 134 patients (1.7 per 1 000 patient-years) receiving fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol, and 5 of 2 070 patients (2.9 per 1 000 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
An overdose will likely produce signs, symptoms or adverse reactions associated with the individual 
components’ pharmacological actions (e.g. Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, 
decrease in bone mineral density, dry mouth, visual accommodation disturbances, tachycardia, arrhythmias, 
tremor, headache, palpitations, nausea, hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia). 
Management 
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with Elebrato Ellipta. If overdose occurs, the patient should be 
treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. 
Cardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that are 
clinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking medicinal 
products should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. 
Further management should be clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where 
available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
anticholinergics including triple combinations with corticosteroids, ATC code: R03AL08.  
Mechanism of action 
Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is a combination of inhaled synthetic corticosteroid, long-acting 
muscarinic receptor antagonist and long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA). Following oral 
inhalation, umeclidinium and vilanterol act locally on airways to produce bronchodilation by separate 
mechanisms and fluticasone furoate reduces inflammation. 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism 
through which fluticasone furoate affects COPD symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and 
mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines) involved in inflammation.  
Umeclidinium 
Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). 
Umeclidinium exerts its bronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine 
with muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 
muscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the 
lungs in pre-clinical models. 
Vilanterol 
Vilanterol is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA). The pharmacologic effects of 
beta2-adrenergic agonists, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular 
adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-
adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth 
muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast 
cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol on the QT interval has not been evaluated in a 
thorough QT (TQT) study. TQT studies for FF/VI and umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) did not show 
clinically relevant effects on QT interval at clinical doses of FF, UMEC and VI. 
No clinically relevant effects on the QTc interval were observed on review of centrally read ECGs from 911 
subjects with COPD exposed to fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol for up to 24 weeks, or in the 
subset of 210 subjects exposed for up to 52 weeks. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Elebrato Ellipta (92/55/22 micrograms), administered as a once-daily treatment, has been 
evaluated in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD in two, active-controlled studies and in a single, non-
inferiority study. All three studies were multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies that required patients 
to be symptomatic with a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score 10 and on daily maintenance treatment for 
their COPD for at least three months prior to study entry. 
FULFIL (CTT116853) was a 24-week study (N=1 810), with an extension up to 52 weeks in a subset of 
subjects (n=430), that compared Elebrato Ellipta (92/55/22 micrograms) with budesonide/formoterol 
400/12 micrograms (BUD/FOR) administered twice-daily. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator 
percent predicted FEV1 was 45% and 65% of patients reported a history of one or more moderate/severe 
exacerbation in the past year. 
IMPACT (CTT116855) was a 52-week study (N=10 355) that compared Elebrato Ellipta 
(92/55/22 micrograms) with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms (FF/VI) and 
umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 micrograms (UMEC/VI). At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent 
predicted FEV1 was 46% and over 99% of patients reported a history of one or more moderate/severe 
exacerbation in the past year. 
At study entry, the most common COPD medications reported in the FULFIL and IMPACT studies were 
ICS +LABA+LAMA (28%, 34% respectively), ICS+LABA (29%, 26% respectively), LAMA+LABA (10%, 
8% respectively) and LAMA (9%, 7% respectively). These patients may have also been taking other COPD 
medications (e.g. mucolytics or leukotriene receptor antagonists). 
Study 200812 was a 24-week, non-inferiority study (N=1 055) that compared Elebrato Ellipta 
(92/55/22 micrograms) with FF/VI (92/22 micrograms) + UMEC (55 micrograms), co-administered once 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
daily as a multi-inhaler therapy in patients with a history of moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 
12 months. 
Lung function 
In FULFIL, bronchodilatory effects with Elebrato Ellipta were evident on the first day of treatment and were 
maintained over the 24-week treatment period (mean changes from baseline in FEV1 were 90-222 mL on 
day 1 and 160-339 mL at week 24). Elebrato Ellipta significantly improved (p<0.001) lung function (as 
defined by mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 24) (see Table 1) and the improvement was 
maintained in the subset of patients who continued treatment to week 52.

In IMPACT, over 52 weeks, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the annual rate of 
moderate/severe exacerbations by 15% (95% CI:10, 20) compared with FF/VI (rate; 0.91 vs 1.07 events per 
patient year) and by 25% (95% CI: 19, 30) compared with UMEC/VI (rate; 0.91 vs 1.21 events per patient 
year). In FULFIL, based upon data up to 24 weeks, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p=0.002) the 
annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations by 35% (95% CI: 14, 51) compared with BUD/FOR. 
In IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta prolonged the time to first moderate/severe exacerbation and significantly 
decreased (p<0.001) the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation, as measured by time to first exacerbation, 
compared with both FF/VI (14.8%; 95% CI: 9.3, 19.9) and UMEC/VI (16.0%; 95% CI: 9.4, 22.1). In 
FULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta significantly decreased the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation compared with 
BUD/FOR over 24 weeks (33%; 95% CI: 12, 48; p=0.004). 
In IMPACT, treatment with Elebrato Ellipta reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbations (i.e., requiring 
hospitalisation or resulting in death) by 13% compared with FF/VI (95% CI: -1, 24; p=0.064). Treatment

with Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbations by 34% compared with 
UMEC/VI (95% CI: 22, 44; p<0.001). 
Health-related quality of life 
Elebrato Ellipta significantly improved (p<0.001) Health Related Quality of Life (as measured by the St 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ] total score) in both FULFIL (week 24) when compared with 
BUD/FOR (-2.2 units; 95% CI: -3.5, -1.0) and IMPACT (week 52) when compared with FF/VI (-1.8 units; 
95% CI: -2.4, -1.1) and UMEC/VI (-1.8 units; 95% CI: -2.6, -1.0). 
A higher percentage of patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta responded with a clinically meaningful 
improvement in SGRQ total score in FULFIL at week 24 compared with BUD/FOR (50% and 41% 
respectively), odds ratios of response vs. non-response (OR) (1.41; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.70) and in IMPACT at 
week 52 compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI (42%, 34% and 34% respectively), OR vs. FF/VI (1.41; 95% 
CI:1.29, 1.55) and OR vs. UMEC/VI (1.41; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.57); all treatment comparisons were statistically 
significant (p<0.001). 
In FULFIL, the proportion of patients who were CAT responders (defined as 2 units below baseline or 
lower) at week 24, was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with Elebrato Ellipta compared 
with BUD/FOR (53% vs. 45%; OR 1.44; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.75). In IMPACT, the proportion of patients 
who were CAT responders at week 52 was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with 
Elebrato Ellipta (42%) compared with FF/VI (37%; OR 1.24; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.36) and UMEC/VI (36%; 
OR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.43). 
Symptom relief 
Breathlessness was measured using the Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score at week 24 in FULFIL 
and week 52 in IMPACT (a subset of patients, n=5 058). In FULFIL the proportion of responders according 
to TDI (defined as at least 1 unit) was significantly higher (p<0.001) for Elebrato Ellipta compared with 
BUD/FOR (61% vs 51%; OR 1.61; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.95). In IMPACT, the proportion of responders was also 
significantly higher (p<0.001) for Elebrato Ellipta (36%) compared with FF/VI (29%; OR 1.36; 95% CI: 
1.19, 1.55) and UMEC/VI (30%; OR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.57). 
In FULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta improved daily symptoms of COPD as assessed by E-RS: COPD total score, 
compared with BUD/FOR (≥2 unit decrease from baseline). The proportion of responders during weeks 
21-24 was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with Elebrato Ellipta compared with BUD/FOR 
(47% and 37% respectively; OR 1.59; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.94). 
Use of rescue medication 
In FULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the use of rescue medication between weeks 
1-24 compared with BUD/FOR (treatment difference: -0.2 occasions per day; 95% CI: -0.3, -0.1). 
In IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the use of rescue medication (occasions per 
day) at each 4-week time period compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI. At weeks 49-52, the treatment 
difference was -0.28 (95% CI: -0.37, -0.19) when compared with FF/VI and -0.30 (95% CI: -0.41, -0.19) 
with UMEC/VI. 
Nighttime awakenings 
In IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta statistically significantly reduced the mean number of nighttime awakenings 
due to COPD compared with FF/VI (-0.05; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01; p=0.005) and with UMEC/VI (-0.10; 95% 
CI: -0.14, -0.05; p<0.001) at weeks 49 to 52. Significant reductions were observed over all other timepoints 
for UMEC/VI (p<0.001) and for the all but two of the of timepoints for FF/VI (p≤0.021). 
Paediatric population 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  waived  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with  Elebrato 
Ellipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
When fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol were administered in combination by the inhaled 
route from a single inhaler in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of each component were similar to those 
observed when each active substance was administered either as fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination 
or as an umeclidinium/vilanterol combination or umeclidinium monotherapy. 
Population PK analyses for FF/UMEC/VI were conducted using a combined PK dataset from three phase III 
studies in 821 COPD subjects. Systemic drug levels (steady state Cmax and AUC) of FF, UMEC and VI 
following FF/UMEC/VI in one inhaler (triple combination) were within the range of those observed 
following FF/VI + UMEC as two inhalers, dual combinations (FF/VI and UMEC/VI), as well as individual 
single inhalers (FF, UMEC and VI). Covariate analysis showed higher FF apparent clearance (42%) when 
comparing FF/VI to FF/UMEC/VI; however, this is not considered clinically relevant. 
Absorption 
Fluticasone furoate 
Following inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, 
fluticasone furoate Cmax occurred at 15 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone furoate when 
administrated as fluticasone furoate/vilanterol by inhalation was 15.2%, primarily due to absorption of the 
inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. 
Following repeat dosing of inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, steady state was achieved within 6 days 
with up to 1.6-fold accumulation. 
Umeclidinium 
Following inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, 
umeclidinium Cmax occurred at 5 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium was on 
average 13%, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled 
umeclidinium, steady state was achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 2-fold accumulation. 
Vilanterol 
Following inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, 
vilanterol Cmax occurred at 7 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled vilanterol was 27%, with 
negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol, 
steady state was achieved within 6 days with up to 1.5-fold accumulation. 
Distribution 
Fluticasone furoate 
Following intravenous dosing of fluticasone furoate to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state of 661 litres. Fluticasone furoate has a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma 
protein binding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate was high, on average >99.6%. 
Umeclidinium  
Following intravenous administration of umeclidinium to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of 
distribution was 86 litres. In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. 
Vilanterol 
Following intravenous administration of vilanterol to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at 
steady  state  was  165 litres.  Vilanterol  has  a  low  association  with  red  blood  cells.  In vitro  plasma  protein 
binding in human plasma was on average 94%. 
Biotransformation 
Fluticasone furoate 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro studies showed that fluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and is a substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic route for fluticasone furoate is 
hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to metabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid 
activity. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. 
Umeclidinium 
In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 
is a substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are oxidative 
(hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of 
metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not 
been established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. 
Vilanterol 
In vitro studies showed that vilanterol is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a 
substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for vilanterol are O-dealkylation to a range 
of metabolites with significantly reduced beta1- and beta2-adrenergic agonist activity. Plasma metabolic 
profiles following oral administration of vilanterol in a human radiolabel study were consistent with high 
first-pass metabolism. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. 
Elimination 
Fluticasone furoate 
The apparent plasma elimination half-life of fluticasone furoate following inhaled administration of 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 24 hours. Following intravenous administration, the 
elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was 
65.4 litres/hour. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 2 % of the intravenously administered dose. 
Following oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism with 
metabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive dose 
eliminated in the urine. 
Umeclidinium  
Umeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% 
to 4% active substance excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state. Plasma clearance following intravenous 
administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous administration, approximately 58% of the 
administered radiolabelled dose was excreted in faeces and approximately 22% of the administered 
radiolabelled dose was excreted in urine. The excretion of the drug-related material in the faeces following 
intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following oral administration, 92% of the administered 
radiolabelled dose was excreted primarily in faeces. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of 
recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following oral 
administration. 
Vilanterol 
Vilanterol plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 11 hours. Plasma 
clearance of vilanterol following intravenous administration was 108 litres/hour. Following oral 
administration of radiolabelled vilanterol, 70% of the radiolabel was excreted in urine and 30% in faeces. 
Primary elimination of vilanterol was by metabolism followed by excretion of metabolites in urine and 
faeces. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol were 
evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No clinically relevant effects requiring dose 
adjustment were observed. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in subjects with renal 
impairment. However, studies have been conducted with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and 
umeclidinium/vilanterol that showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate, 
umeclidinium or vilanterol. In vitro protein binding studies between subjects with severe renal impairment 
and healthy volunteers were conducted, and no clinically significant evidence of altered protein binding was 
seen.  
The effects of haemodialysis have not been studied.  
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic 
impairment. However, studies have been conducted with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and 
umeclidinium/vilanterol. 
The fluticasone furoate/vilanterol component of Elebrato Ellipta was assessed in patients with all severities 
of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). For fluticasone furoate, patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment showed up to three times higher systemic exposure (FF 184 micrograms); therefore, patients 
with severe hepatic impairment received half the dose (FF 92 micrograms). At this dose, no effects on 
systemic exposure were observed. Therefore, caution is advised in moderate to severe hepatic impairment, 
but no specific dose adjustment based on hepatic function is recommended. There was no significant 
increase in systemic exposure to vilanterol. 
Patients with moderate hepatic impairment showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to either 
umeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC). Umeclidinium has not been evaluated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Other special populations 
The effects of race, gender and weight on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and 
vilanterol were also evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  
In 113 East Asian subjects with COPD (Japanese and East Asian Heritage), who received FF/UMEC/VI 
from a single inhaler (27% subjects), fluticasone furoate AUC(ss) estimates were on average 30% higher 
compared with Caucasian subjects. However, these higher systemic exposures remain below the threshold 
for FF-induced reduction of serum and urine cortisol and are not considered clinically relevant. 
There was no effect of race on pharmacokinetic parameters of umeclidinium or vilanterol in subjects with 
COPD. 
No clinically relevant differences requiring dose adjustment based on race, gender or weight were observed 
in fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol systemic exposure. 
In terms of other patient characteristics, a study in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers showed no evidence of a 
clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on systemic exposure to umeclidinium.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Pharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol in 
nonclinical studies were those typically associated with glucocorticoids, muscarinic receptor antagonists, or 
beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Administration of combined fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and 
vilanterol to dogs did not result in any significant new toxicity or any major exacerbation of expected 
findings associated with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol alone.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Fluticasone furoate 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime 
inhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures of 1.4- or 2.9-fold, respectively, those seen in humans at a 
daily dose of 92 micrograms fluticasone furoate, based on AUC.  
Umeclidinium 
Umeclidinium was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime 
inhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures  20- or  17- fold the human clinical exposure at a daily dose 
of 55 micrograms umeclidinium, based on AUC respectively. 
Vilanterol 
Vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic indicating that vilanterol 
(as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans. Consistent with findings for other beta2 
agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate caused proliferative effects in the female rat and 
mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. There was no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at 
exposures 0.9- or 22-fold, respectively, the human clinical exposure of vilanterol at a daily dose of 
22 micrograms based on AUC. 
Toxicity to reproduction and development 
Fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol did not have any adverse effects on male or female fertility 
in rats.  
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused 
abortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at exposures 6.6-
fold the human clinical exposure at a daily dose of 92 micrograms, based on AUC. Fluticasone furoate had 
no adverse effect on pre- or post-natal development in rats.  
Umeclidinium 
Umeclidinium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous 
administration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption 
and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose 
(approximately 61-fold the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium at a daily dose of 55 micrograms, 
based on AUC). 
Vilanterol 
Vilanterol was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol caused effects similar to 
those seen with other beta2-adrenergic agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb 
flexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 62-fold the human 
clinical exposure at a daily dose of 22 micrograms, based on AUC. Vilanterol had no adverse effect on pre- 
or post-natal development in rats.

Step-by-step instructions 
1.  What Elebrato Ellipta is and what it is used for 
What Elebrato Ellipta is 
Elebrato Ellipta contains three active substances called fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and 
vilanterol. Fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called 
steroids. Umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. 
What Elebrato Ellipta is used for 
Elebrato Ellipta is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a long-
term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  
In COPD the muscles around the airways tighten, making breathing difficult. This medicine widens these 
muscles in the lungs, reducing the swelling and irritation in the small air passages and making it easier for air 
to get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your breathing difficulties and 
reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  
Elebrato Ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or 
other symptoms of COPD. It should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or 
wheezing. If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). If 
you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Elebrato Ellipta  
Do not use Elebrato Ellipta:  
- 
if you are allergic to fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, vilanterol or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6).

of narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Infection of the lung

Pregnancy and breast-feeding

3. 
How to use Elebrato Ellipta 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one inhalation every day at the same time of day. You only need to inhale once a 
day because the effect of this medicine lasts for 24 hours.  
Do not use more than your doctor tells you to use.  
Use Elebrato Ellipta regularly 
It is very important that you use Elebrato Ellipta every day, as instructed by your doctor. This will help to 
keep you free of symptoms throughout the day and night.  
Elebrato Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If you get 
this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). 
How to use the inhaler 
See ‘Step-by-step instructions’ at the end of this leaflet for full information.  
Elebrato Ellipta is for inhalation use. 
Once the tray is opened Elebrato Ellipta is ready to use.  
If your symptoms do not improve  
If your COPD symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse, or if you are using 
your quick-acting inhaler more often: 
contact your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you use more Elebrato Ellipta than you should  
If you accidentally use too much of this medicine, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice 
immediately as you may need medical attention. If possible, show them the inhaler, the package or this 
leaflet. You may notice that your heart is beating faster than usual, you feel shaky, you have visual 
disturbances, have a dry mouth, or have a headache. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Elebrato Ellipta  
Do not inhale a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just inhale your next dose at the usual time. 
If you become wheezy or breathless, use your quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol), then seek medical 
advice.  
If you stop using Elebrato Ellipta  
Use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. Do not stop unless your doctor advises you to, 
even if you feel better, as your symptoms may get worse.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first opening. 
If stored in a refrigerator, allow the inhaler to return to room temperature for at least one hour before use.

The step-by-step instructions for use of the inhaler provided below can be used for either the 30-dose (30-day 
supply) or the 14-dose (14-day supply) Ellipta inhaler. 
1)  Read this before you start 
If you open and close the cover without inhaling the medicine, you will lose the dose. 
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. 
Cover 
Each time you open 
this, you prepare one 
dose of medicine. 
Dose counter 
This shows how many doses of medicine are 
left in the inhaler.  
Before the inhaler has been used, it shows 
exactly 30 doses.  
It counts down by 1 each time you open the 
cover. 
When fewer than 10 doses are left, half of 
the dose counter shows red. 
After you have used the last dose, half of the 
dose counter shows red and the number 0 
is displayed. Your inhaler is now empty. 
If you open the cover after this, the dose 
counter will change from half red to 
completely red. 
For the 14-dose inhaler, the dose counter will also show half red when there are fewer than 10 doses left, 
and then will show half red with the number 0 after the last dose is used. The dose counter will appear 
completely red if the cover is opened again. 
2)  Prepare a dose 
Wait to open the cover until you are ready to take your dose.  
Do not shake the inhaler. 
•  Slide the cover down until you hear a “click”.

Your medicine is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. 
• 
If the dose counter does not count down as you hear the “click”, the inhaler will not deliver 
medicine. Take it back to your pharmacist for advice. 
•  Do not shake the inhaler at any time. 
3) 
Inhale your medicine  
•  While holding the inhaler away from your mouth, breathe out as far as is comfortable.  
Do not breathe out into the inhaler. 
•  Put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips firmly around it. 
Do not block the air vent with your fingers. 
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of the 
mouthpiece for inhaling. 
Do not block the air vent 
with your fingers. 
•  Take one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath in for as long as possible (at least 3-4 
seconds). 
•  Remove the inhaler from your mouth. 
•  Breathe out slowly and gently. 
You may not be able to taste or feel the medicine, even when you are using the inhaler correctly. 
If you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before you close the cover. 
4)  Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth 
•  Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece.

•  Rinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow.  
This will make it less likely that you will develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects.

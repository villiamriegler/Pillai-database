1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Mometasone is considered an endocrine active substance 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC in order 
to include a statement regarding the risk to the 
environment based on results from ERA study 
Mometasone furoate – Fish Sexual Development Test 
with Zebrafish (Danio rerio). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to 
the PI. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
(EAS) and is therefore potentially harmful to aquatic life at 
a Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water 
(PECsw) below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A GLP-
compliant OECD 234 Fish Sexual Development study was 
carried out and as a result section 5.3 was updated to 
indicate that ‘Environmental risk assessment studies have 
shown that mometasone may pose a risk to surface water.’ 
and section 6.6. that “This medicinal product may pose a 
risk to the environment (See section 5.3). Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of 
in accordance with local requirements.’ 
The Package Leaflet (PL) (section 5) is updated accordingly.

final results from the ARGON study. As a result, section 
5.1. has been updated accordingly to state under the  
“Comparison of Enerzair Breezhaler to the concurrent open-
label administration of salmeterol/fluticasone + tiotropium” 
heading that a randomised, partially blinded, active 
treatment controlled, non inferiority study (ARGON) 
comparing Enerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg 
once daily and 114 mcg/46 mcg/68 mcg once daily to the 
concurrent administration of salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily + tiotropium 5 mcg 
once daily over 24 weeks of treatment was conducted. 
Enerzair Breezhaler demonstrated non inferiority to 
salmeterol/fluticasone + tiotropium for the primary 
endpoint (change from baseline for Asthma Quality of Life 
Questionnaire [AQLQ S]), in previously symptomatic 
patients on ICS and LABA therapy with a difference of 
0.073 (one sided lower 97.5% confidence limit [CL]:  
0.027).

Introduction 
The  MAH  applied  to  include  an  indication  for  pre-therapeutic  stimulation  in  post-thyroidectomy 
patients maintained on THST (e.g. Thyroxine) in the ablation of thyroid remnant tissue in combination 
with RAI. The intended posology for this new indication is the same as for the approved diagnostic 
indication.  In  support  of  this  proposed  new  indication,  the  MAH  has  submitted  a  single  randomised 
controlled  study  comparing  the  rates  of  thyroid  remnant  ablation  achieved  after  patients  were 
randomised  to  treatment  with  Thyrogen  plus  RAI  versus  hypothyroidism  plus  RAI.  In  addition,  the 
MAH  has  submitted  literature  relevant  to  the  use  of  Thyrogen  as  an  adjunct  to  RAI  therapy  for  the 
ablation of thyroid remnant tissue. 
1.1  Rationale for the proposed change 
Thyroid  cancer  is  uncommon  (2%  of  all  cancers)  and  mainly  affects  female  adults.  The  global 
incidence ranges from 0.5 to 10 cases per 100,000, with approximately 20,000 new cases diagnosed 
annually in Europe. Well-differentiated thyroid cancer accounts for 80-90% of all thyroid cancers. In 
general,  patients  respond  well  to  therapy  with  a  reported  10-year  survival  rate  >  80%.  Nonetheless, 
late recurrences, often decades after initial therapy, require life long follow up.  
Primary  treatment  of  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer  is  (near)-total  thyroidectomy  followed  by 
ablation  of  the  remaining  glandular  tissue  using  a  high  dose  of  131I  (RAI).  Post-thyroidectomised 
patients lack the ability to produce thyroid hormone and require lifelong thyroxine replacement. High 
levels  of  circulating  thyroid  hormones  inhibit  TSH  production.  On  the  other  hand,  an  elevated  TSH 
level  in  the  blood  is  essential  for  remnant  ablation  because  TSH  stimulates  the  uptake  of  131I  into 
thyroid tissue and residual thyroid cancerous cells. Traditionally, stimulation of  131I uptake  has  been 
achieved by withdrawing thyroxine replacement therapy, rendering the patient hypothyroid until levels 
of endogenous TSH are ≥ 25 mU/l. However, this hypothyroid state is often associated with a variety 
of  symptoms  (including  depression,  fatigue,  cold  intolerance,  constipation,  worsening  hypertension, 
bradycardia  and  decreased  myocardial  contractility).  Moreover,  in  some  patients  with  heart  disease, 
pulmonary disease, or other underlying medical illnesses, the hypothyroid state may aggravate these 
conditions.  Therefore,  alternative  131I  uptake-enhancing  treatments  avoiding  hypothyroidism  and 
associated morbidity are desirable.  
Elevation  of  TSH  in  the  blood  using  an  exogenous  source  of  TSH,  such  as  Thyrogen,  may  be  an 
attractive and similarly effective alternative. Clinical studies have confirmed that Thyrogen enhances 
131I  uptake  in  thyroid  tissue  for  whole  body  scanning  (WBS)  and  stimulates  a  Tg  response  while 
patients remain euthyroid.

Clinical aspects 
Analysis of data submitted 
The pivotal trial (THYR-008-00) in this application was a randomised, controlled, open-label, multi-
national  study  of  thyroid  remnant  ablation  comparing  the  safety  and  ablation  rate  following  131I 
administration using Thyrogen vs. 131I administration in the hypothyroid state. 
Following  total  or  near-total  thyroidectomy  patients  were  randomised  within  14  days  to  one  of  the 
following 2 groups (see Figure 1): 
• 
Euthyroid group: following randomisation patients immediately started on THST and TSH was 
measured after 4 weeks and, if necessary, additionally at 6 weeks. If TSH level was ≤ 5 mU/l, 
Thyrogen was administered at 0.9 mg IM qd x 2 days, and 24 hours following the second dose, 
an ablative activity of 131I (100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) was administered orally. 
Hypothyroid  group:  Patients  were  not  placed  on  THST  until  completion  of  the  dosimetry 
assessments and were monitored for at least 4 weeks (and 1 and 2 weeks thereafter) until their 
TSH was ≥ 25 mU/l. Patients then received 100 mCi 131I.

                          Evaluation of success/failure 
A wide range of  131I doses (activity) (15 mCi – 200 mCi) is used to ablate thyroid remnants with the 
dose depending on the amount of residual tissue. A recent retrospective study showed that relatively 
low  patient-specific  doses  (30-76  mCi)  led  to  unsuccessful  ablation  in  more  than  40%  cases. 
Successful ablation of 81% of 70 patients has been reported in the US using a dosimetric approach, as 
an alternative to empirical treatment, and the mean administered 131I activity required to deliver 30,000 
rads (cGy) to a typical remnant tissue was 87 mCi. Therefore, the consensus of experts recommended 
a routine dose of 100 mCi 131I for this study. 
Following 131I ablation, whole body probe measurements and blood collections were conducted at 2 h, 
6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h to 96 h, and 96 h to 168 h (preferably 120 h) to obtain whole body  131I activity 
data. Patients then underwent post-treatment WBS and remnant neck imaging at 48, 72 to 96 and at 96 
to 168 hours (preferably 120 hours). In addition, the study allowed for the option to perform additional 
scans at 24 hours and between 144 and 168 hours. WBS was conducted using a dual-head scintillation 
camera that produced conjugate-view images of the whole body and of the neck. Following the 96 to 
168  hour  WBS  and  neck  imaging,  all  patients  received  continuous  THST.  Three  (±1)  and  6  (±1) 
months after ablation, patients returned to the clinic for a safety check-up including TSH and Tg level 
determination. Eight (±1) months after ablation patients in both groups received Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM

qd  x  2  days)  while  in  the  euthyroid  state  followed  by  4  mCi  131I.  WBS  and  neck  imaging  were 
conducted  48  hours  after  the  RAI  administration.  3  independent  readers  to  determine  presence  or 
absence  of  visible  uptake  in  the  thyroid  bed  evaluated  the  neck  scan  in  a  blinded  manner.  In  cases 
where the majority of the readers determined that the RAI uptakes were detectable by eye and located 
in  the  thyroid  bed,  the  percentage  of  131I  uptake  in  the  thyroid  bed  was  determined.  Basal  and 
Thyrogen-stimulated serum Tg levels were obtained 72 hours after the second dose of Thyrogen. 
The primary objectives were to demonstrate that the use of Thyrogen in euthyroid patients undergoing 
radioiodine remnant ablation results in a comparable ablation rate to patients in the hypothyroid state, 
and to document the safety profile of Thyrogen in this setting. Secondary objectives were to examine 
the patients’ Quality of Life (QoL) and to compare the RAI uptake and retention into the thyroid bed 
and its clearance in the body. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  successful  thyroid  remnant  ablation  as  assessed  by  the  8  (±1) 
month follow-up scan and defined as a negative neck scan (“no visible uptake or, if visible uptake, less 
than  0.1% uptake  in the thyroid bed”). In cases of  scans with visible  uptake, percentage  uptake was 
quantified  at  the  Dosimetry  Coordination  Centre.  Thyroid  remnant  mass  was  estimated  prior  to  the 
completion  of  each  dosimetry  assessment,  as  described  in  the  Dosimetry  Operational  Manual.  The 
proportion of the patients demonstrating treatment success was computed for each treatment group.  
In  addition  to  this  primary  endpoint,  successful  remnant  ablation  was  also  judged  by  a  criterion 
suggested by the FDA of “no visible uptake in the thyroid bed", a secondary endpoint. 
Adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  laboratory  findings  (chemistry, 
haematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, changes in symptoms or physical findings, and development 
of antibodies to Thyrogen were assessed. 
Secondary efficacy variables were individual and mean TSH and Tg levels, QoL determined using the 
SF-36 questionnaire and the Billewicz scale (a clinical symptom index for hypothyroidism consisting 
of 14 items) and RAI kinetics (activity-time curves, half-life (if appropriate), residence time, and area 
under activity-time curve) as determined by dosimetric calculations based on data from blood analysis 
and gamma camera counts. Stimulated serum Tg levels were also used to assess ablation success; a Tg 
cut-off level of 2 ng/ml was proposed as widely accepted and appropriate, although analyses using a 
cut-off level of 1 ng/ml were also performed as other experts have quoted this level. The SF-36 Health 
Status Survey and the Billewicz scale were completed at the time of randomisation, 2 weeks (±4 days) 
after  randomisation,  either  1  to  2  (±  2)  days  before  ablation  (Hypothyroid  group)  or  just  before 
Thyrogen administration before the ablation (Euthyroid group), and 1 month after ablation. 
The  following  main  inclusion  criteria  were  applied:  patients  ≥18  years  old  with  newly  diagnosed 
including  papillaryfollicular  variant, 
thyroid  carcinoma, 
differentiated  papillary  or  follicular 
characterised as “T2, N0 or N1, and M0” or as “T1, N1, and M0” as defined by standard American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) / International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria, with total or 
near-total  thyroidectomy  within  2  weeks  prior  to  enrolment  and  previously  untreated  for  thyroid 
malignancy (other than surgery), with normal complete blood count (CBC) and creatinine values, and 
standard precautions to avoid pregnancy. 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
- 
Hurthle  cell  carcinoma,  anaplastic  or  medullary  thyroid  cancer,  or  lymphoma  of  the  thyroid 
gland. 
Evidence of distant metastatic disease characterised as M1. 
Recent  history  (within  the  past  5  years)  of  concomitant  malignancy,  other  than  squamous  or 
basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 
Concurrent major medical disorder (e.g. documented cardiac disease, advanced renal failure). 
Presence of non-thyroidal conditions known to affect 131I uptake (e.g. congestive heart failure).

Drugs  that  may  affect  thyroid  or  renal  function  (e.g.  certain  renal  drugs,  lithium,  amiodarone, 
other iodine-containing medication, or corticosteroids). 
Long-acting thyroid hormone (i.e. levothyroxine) within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. 
Patient radioiodine kinetics were assessed in the local laboratories in order to evaluate whole body and 
blood retention activity-time curves, clearance (hours), and cumulated activity. Urinary iodine samples 
were collected within 2 days prior to the 131I administration (Hypothyroid group) or within 2 days prior 
to the Thyrogen administration (Euthyroid group), and at follow-up for both groups to rule out iodine 
excess, and measured by a designated central lab. TSH measurements were done at local laboratories 
using the same validated brand test kit. Serum samples for Tg measurements were frozen and sent to a 
designated central laboratory for evaluation. Tg levels were measured for all samples; the Tg antibody 
titre was measured from the sample collected at screening only. After the study was completed, data 
regarding the Tg antibody status of patients at 8 months became available. 
Concerning  statistical  methods  and  study  design,  a  93%  ablation  rate  for  both  groups  was  assumed 
based on recent published studies showing successful ablation rates ranging from 88% to 100%. The 
study size (at least 25 patients per group) was calculated so that by using the standard non-inferiority 
framework  it  would  be  possible  to  exclude  a  clinical  difference  of  20%  in  ablation  rates.  The 
probability that the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the ablation rates 
in the 2 treatment groups would not include the clinically relevant difference was 79%. According to 
protocol,  this  study  was  intended  to  provide  preliminary  data  and  thus  the  study  was  not  formally 
powered  to  assess  treatment  group  differences;  no  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  planned  on  any 
parameter  and  outcomes  were  summarised  and  tabulated  by  treatment  group  for  comparison.  All 
efficacy  analyses  were  to  be  performed  on  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomised 
patients). The primary efficacy analyses were also performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population (all 
ITT  patients  who  satisfied  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  and  did  not  exhibit  major  study  protocol 
violations or deviations that would impact on the efficacy assessment).  
Descriptive statistics of efficacy variables and 95% CIs for the difference between ablation rates were 
calculated for comparison of the 2 treatment groups with a predefined clinically relevant difference of 
20%. No adjustment for covariates and no centre-stratified analysis was performed because the patient 
population was not large enough to produce meaningful results. 
Results and Discussion 
The MAH states that the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements.  
Of  66  patients  enrolled,  30  patients  were  randomised  to  the  hypothyroid  group,  33  to  the  euthyroid 
group  and  3  were  found  to  be  ineligible.  One  patient  in  the  hypothyroid  group  withdrew  before  the 
month  8  primary  efficacy  assessment  due  to  an  AE  (lung  metastases).  All  patients  in  the  euthyroid 
group completed the study, although 1 patient was ineligible for inclusion in the PP population as they 
did not receive a second regular dose of Thyrogen before ablation. 
Demographic  and  medical  parameters  and  cancer  types  were  similarly  distributed  between  the  2 
treatment  groups.  Tumour  staging  was  not  clearly  different  between  the  two  groups  except  that 
slightly more patients in the hypothyroid group had a tumour extending the thyroid capsule (T4). All 
patients in the euthyroid and hypothyroid groups achieved the target TSH levels (≤ 5 mU/l and ≥ 25 
mU/l, respectively) within the pre-specified 6 weeks.  
Efficacy 
Since the ITT population and the PP population differed by only 2 patients, the decision was made to 
limit PP analysis to the scan and Tg level efficacy assessments. 
The results of the WBS for the primary and FDA-recommended endpoints are shown below.

1 The scan from 1 patient (Patient 309) was not considered interpretable by 2 of the 3 readers. 
2 In every case where thyroid bed uptake was seen, the measured uptake was < 0.1% of the administered activity. 
Using the pre-defined primary endpoint of “no visible uptake or, if visible, < 0.1% uptake” 100% of 
patients  with  interpretable  scans  had  successful  ablation.  CIs  cannot  be  formally  calculated  because 
there was 100% ablation in both groups. Using the endpoint recommended by the FDA of "no visible 
uptake in the thyroid bed" the results were higher in the hypothyroid group (85.7%) than the euthyroid 
group (75%) although when quantified, the amount of uptake was below the cut off of < 0.1% in each 
case.  The  sample  size  was  not  large  enough  for  the  95%  CI  (-30.5%,  9.1%)  to  demonstrate  non-
inferiority  of  the  euthyroid  group  vs.  the  hypothyroid  group  for  the  FDA-defined  endpoint  by 
excluding the predefined 20% difference in ablation rates. 
Regarding secondary endpoints, the results of Thyrogen-stimulated serum Tg levels are shown below.

1 Patients with evaluable scans (at 8 months) and low anti-Tg antibody status at screening were included in 
the Tg analysis. 
Using  the  <  2  ng/ml  cut-off  level,  the  results  indicate  that  remnant  ablation  was  achieved  in  more 
euthyroid (96%) than hypothyroid patients (86%), and the 95% CI for the difference in ablation rates 
(-6.85%,  27.09%)  excludes  the  relevant  difference  (20%)  in  the  lower  bound  suggesting  that  the 
euthyroid  group  is  non-inferior  to  the  hypothyroid  group.  The  results  using  a  cut-off  of  <  1  ng/ml 
showed succesfull ablation was lower in the euthyroid group (83%) than the hypothyroid group (86%). 
The lower bound of the 95% CI (-23.5%, 18.7%) failed to exclude the predefined clinical difference of 
20%, failing to demonstrate non-inferiority of the euthyroid group vs. the hypothyroid group. 
Further to a request from CHMP, the MAH presented results of follow up scans on patients with Tg 
concentrations above either cut-off level. Out of 9 patients with detectable stimulated Tg at 8 months 
(5  had  >  2ng/ml)  only  one  had  a  positive  WBS.  On  the  other  hand,  of  15  patients  with  detectable 
thyroid bed uptake only 2 (13%) had elevated stimulated Tg, consistent with the increasing physician 
reliance on Tg testing in the absence of anti Tg antibodies. 
Patients  in  both  treatment  groups  started  with  high  mean  TSH  levels,  as  they  were  not  on  THST  at 
time of surgery. In the hypothyroid group, the level rose to 82.9mU/l by week 4 and all reached the

required  25mU/l  within  the  protocol-specified  time.  At  8  months  post-ablation  the  mean  TSH  level 
was 0.2 mU/l, indicating good THST compliance. In the euthyroid group, the mean TSH level was low 
at week 4 (1.1mU/l) due to THST. All patients reached the required ≤ 5mU/l within the specified time. 
At 8 months the mean TSH level was unexpectedly high (3.3mU/l) due to 1 patient (96mU/l) who had 
not taken TSHT properly. 
Regarding  radioiodine  kinetics,  the  fraction  of  administered  131I  activity  found  in  the  whole  body  at 
different time points showed a somewhat faster decrease in the euthyroid group than the hypothyroid 
group (e.g. the mean fraction of administered activity at 48 hours was 6.5% and 12.6 %, respectively). 
Consequently, the mean residence time (MRT) in the whole body was higher in the hypothyroid (24.0 
± 7.63 h) than the euthyroid group (17.3 ± 3.89 h).  
A faster decrease in the mean fraction of administered activity at 48 hours was also seen in the blood 
of euthyroid (0.8%) vs. hypothyroid group (1.8%). MRT in the blood was also lower in the euthyroid 
group (2.3 ± 0.73 h vs. 3.5 ± 1.63h). The mean dose to blood per unit (MBq) of administered activity, 
a surrogate measure for dose-limiting bone marrow dose, was lower in the euthyroid (0.266 ± 0.0613 
mGy/MBq) than the hypothyroid group (0.395 ± 0.1345 mGy/MBq), assuming 0.2-mm radius blood 
vessels and calculated from the fit to data. 
The fraction of administered activity, MRT and mean  percentage uptake in remnant tissue were also 
slightly higher in the hypothyroid group at different time points, as shown in the table below.

Although these results seem to support the hypothesis of reduced RAI exposure for euthyroid patients, 
the study was not powered to find differences in 131I kinetics in remnant tissue between the 2 groups. 
The  mean  urinary  iodine  (µg/dl)  was  higher,  although  below  the  threshold  considered  critical  for 
efficient  RAI  uptake,  in  the  Euthyroid  group  than  in  the  hypothyroid  group.  A  post-hoc  analysis 
showed  that  the  differences  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  mean  creatinine  clearance  was 
higher in the euthyroid (143.5 ± 92.4 ml/min) than hypothyroid group (92.4 ± 46.2 ml/min), although 
individual  patient  creatinine  clearance  values  (except  for  1  patient)  were  determined  not  to  be 
clinically significant.

Using the Billewicz scale the hypothyroid group reported more events of cold intolerance (50.0% vs. 
21.2%), weight increase (60.0% vs. 21.2%), constipation (43.3% vs. 3.0%), slow movements (50.0% 
vs. 12.1%), cold skin (46.7% vs. 12.1%), and periorbital puffiness (50.0% vs. 0%) during the 4-week 
period  preceding  ablation  compared  to  the  euthyroid  group.  Mean  total  scores  returned  to  the  level 
seen in the euthyroid group 1 month after ablation, when Hypothyroid patients were again on THST.

Two studies were performed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (Robbins 2001; Robbins 
2002). In the first study, 10 patients (5M, 5F, mean age 47.5 years) were maintained on thyroxine and 
given Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM qd for 2 days) followed by 131I (mean dose 110.3 mCi). Nine patients had 
papillary  thyroid  cancer  (four  with  positive  cervical  nodes)  and  one  poorly  differentiated  thyroid 
cancer. Follow-up diagnostic scans (DxWBS) were obtained 5-13 months later using a scanning dose 
of 5 mCi. No visible uptake was present in the thyroid bed in any patient.  
The  second  paper  (Robbins  2002)  describes  a  retrospective  review  of  clinical  practice  and  patient 
outcomes in 87 patients (mean age 45 years) with differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent thyroid 
remnant ablation over a 2-year period. The study was not randomised but the MAH states the authors 
felt the assignment of patients to a regimen of Thyrogen (n = 45) vs. thyroxine withdrawal (n = 42) 
was  relatively  unbiased.  The  mean  ablative  dose  of  131I  was  110.4  mCi  for  Thyrogen  and  128.9  for 
THW, respectively. At follow-up diagnostic scanning after ablation (mean 11 months), 84% prepared 
using Thyrogen and 81% prepared by THW showed no visible uptake in the thyroid bed. The median 
Thyrogen-stimulated  serum  Tg  levels  at  follow-up  were  0.5  ng/ml  (range  0.3-4980  ng/ml)  in  the 
Thyrogen group and 0.65 ng/ml (range 0.3-5000 ng/ml) in the THW group (p=0.48). Ten of 44 (22%) 
patients  in  Thyrogen  group  vs.15  of  42  (35%)  in  the  THW  group  were  above  the  Tg  cut  off  of 
<2ng/ml. Robins concluded that the two methods of preparation for 131I ablation gave similar results. 
Comparable  findings  have  been  recently  published  (Barbaro  et  al,  2003).  Sixteen  consecutively 
enrolled  patients  (10  F,  6  M;  age  range  22  –  71  years)  with  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer  were 
assigned to receive Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM qd on 2 days) while euthyroid. Thyroxine was omitted on 4 
days  of  the  regimen  (from  the  day  before  first  Thyrogen  injection  until  the  day  after  1311 
administration) in an attempt to lower any theoretical interference of the iodine content of thyroxine 
with the radioiodine therapy. Another 24 consecutively enrolled patients (18 F, 6 M; age range 24 – 69 
years) were assigned to THW. All received 30 mCi 1311 and DxWBS assessed the efficacy of ablation 
after  1  year.  A  non-statistically  significantly  higher  rate  of  successful  ablation  was  achieved  by 
Thyrogen stimulation compared with the hypothyroid state (81% versus 75%).  
In  contrast,  Pacini  et  al.  (2002)  reported  a  lower  rate  of  successful  ablation  for  patients  with 
differentiated thyroid cancer prepared with Thyrogen compared to THW. In this study 30 mCi 131I was 
administered 48 hours after the last injection of Thyrogen, rather than 24 hours as recommended in the 
SPC.  The  pre-ablation  regimens  used  were  THW  (n  =  50),  THW  +  Thyrogen  (n  =  42),  and 
euthyroidism  +  Thyrogen  (n  =  70).  Patients  had  similar  baseline  characteristics,  none  had  known 
distant  metastases  and  they  were  consecutively  enrolled  into  the  3  groups.  Diagnostic  scanning  was 
performed at 6-10 months. Successful ablation was defined as "no visible uptake of radioiodine in the 
thyroid  bed".  The  rates  of  successful  ablation  were  84%,  79%,  and  54%,  respectively.  The  MAH 
suggests that use of a suboptimal timing of the  131I schedule with respect to Thyrogen administration 
might explain the less favourable outcome compared with the other studies, as mean peak serum TSH 
concentrations are reached 10-24 hrs after the last administration of Thyrogen. 
There is a further publication (Berg 2002) of 11 patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer treated 
with Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM x 2 doses) as an adjunct to radioiodine therapy (108 mCi) in elderly or frail 
patients.  Ablation  of  a  thyroid  remnant  was  the  intent  in  only  3  of  the  patients  (aged  78,  75  and  56 
years).  All  3  patients  were  thought  to  have  had  their  thyroid  remnants  fully  ablated  as  judged  by 
<0.1% uptake in the thyroid bed and low serum Tg levels.  
Safety 
The safety population for study THYR-008-00 included all 63 randomised patients. 
Adverse events (AE) 
The Pre-treatment period is defined as the time from randomisation to ablation (hypothyroid group) or 
to  Thyrogen  administration  (euthyroid  group),  which  for  both  groups  could  last  from  4-6  weeks. 
During this period, 13 (39.4 %) euthyroid patients experienced 36 AEs, of which asthenia and fatigue 
was the most common (3 patients each). One patient experienced a SAE (worsening infection of the 
first finger) not related to study medication and fully recovered. In the hypothyroid group, 12 (40.0%) 
patients experienced 30 AEs, of which headache and nausea were the most common (3 patients each).

Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events occurring from time of ablation (hypothyroid group) or 
Thyrogen treatment (euthyroid group) until follow-up at month 8 or last observation. The percentages 
of patients in the hypothyroid and euthyroid groups experiencing treatment-emergent AEs (78.8% vs. 
73.3%),  SAEs  (3.0  vs.  6.7),  severe  AEs  (6.1  vs.  13.3)  and  (at  least  possibly)  treatment-related  AEs 
(24.2 vs.  26.7) were similar. The  most frequent  AEs in the Euthyroid group were fatigue, insomnia, 
rhinitis,  anxiety,  pharyngitis,  nausea,  paraesthesia,  and  skeletal  pain,  pain,  back  pain,  malaise, 
coughing, headache, sweating increased, and urinary tract infection. In the Hypothyroid group, fatigue, 
nausea, lab test abnormal, insomnia, skeletal pain, and pain were the most frequent AEs.  
No deaths occurred during this study.   
The Ablation Period was defined as the time period from time of ablation (Hypothyroid) or the time of 
Thyrogen  treatment  (Euthyroid)  up  to  7  days  after  ablation,  after  which  both  groups  were  treated 
identically. As shown in the Table below, 13 (43.4%) Hypothyroid patients and 15 (45.5%) patients in 
the Euthyroid group experienced at least 1 AE.  
The  AEs  of  8  patients  in  each  group  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  use  of  the  study 
medication.  There  were  23  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  Euthyroid  group  and  14  in  the  hypothyroid 
group. The  most frequently reported treatment-related  AEs were nausea (4  patients) and fatigue  and 
taste loss (2 patients each) in the Euthyroid group, and fatigue (3 patients) and nausea and skeletal pain 
(2  patients  each)  in  the  hypothyroid  group.  One  Euthyroid  patient  experienced  2  episodes  of  nausea 
and 2 episodes of taste loss. All other patients in both treatment groups experienced no  more than 1 
occurrence of each related AE. 
Regarding  discontinuations  due to  AEs,  1  patient (Hypothyroid  group)  withdrew before the  primary 
efficacy assessment (Month 8) due to disease progression NOS, reported as severe and unrelated.

Mean  values  for  blood  chemistry  and  haematology  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  One 
hypothyroid patient had elevated baseline AST and ALT values, which increased at month 8. This was 
considered  unrelated  to  study  drug.  Another  patient  (hypothyroid  group)  had  a  normal  baseline 
creatinine, which  increased at week 4  and returned to within the  normal range at  month 8.  This was 
also considered unrelated to study drug.  
There were no indications during the study that warranted testing for anti-TSH antibodies. Antibodies 
to Tg were tested at screening since they can interfere with proper measurement of serum Tg levels. 
The  protocol  specified  that  patients  who  were  “positive  for  antibodies”  should  be  excluded  from 
analyses related to Tg levels. However, nearly every patient had detectable trace titres (or higher) of 
antibody  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study.  It  was  necessary  to  refine  the  definition  of  “positive  for 
antibodies”, which was arbitrarily set at a limit of 50 U/ml. Eight patients (euthyroid group) and seven 
(hypothyroid  group)  had  values  >  50  U/ml  (most  were  substantially  higher);  all  15  patients  were 
excluded from the Thyrogen-stimulated Tg analyses. 
Discussion 
The  study  design  is  acceptable;  the  treatments  and  their  assessment  are  scientifically  sound  and  in 
accordance with current guidelines. 
Efficacy 
The  application  is  based  on  a  single  pivotal  study.  The  CPMP  Points  to  Consider  (PtC)  on 
Applications  with  One  Pivotal  study  (CPMP/EWP/2330/99)  states  that  the  extent  of  confirmatory 
phase III data needed depends upon what is established for the product by earlier development phases 
and what is known of related products. The pharmacological rationale of Thyrogen therapy is known, 
and  the  safety  and  tolerability  have  been  previously  evaluated  in  studies  supporting  the  original 
approval.  As  regards  the  dose  response,  the  rationale  for  the  choice  of  dose  in  this  pre-remnant 
ablation population has not been provided. 
Study  THYR-008-00  meets  the  fundamental  requirements  of  phase  III  documentation  in  terms  of 
internal validity (i.e. no indication of potential bias), lack of individual centre effect, clinical relevance 
and  data  quality.  However,  some  weaknesses  have  been  noted  with  respect  to  the  CHMP  PtC, 
regarding  internal  consistency  (different  endpoints  did  not  show  similar  findings),  external  validity 
(small study population i.e. 63 patients, 33 of whom received Thyrogen, only patients who received an 
ablative dose of 100mCi were studied.) and the degree of statistical significance (the sample size was 
too small and the 95% CI of the FDA-defined endpoint and the Tg level cut-off of < 1 ng/ml failed to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of the euthyroid group). 
The success of remnant ablation is judged using the results of both WBS results and Tg measurements. 
According to the predefined primary endpoint and serum Tg levels (< 2 ng/ml), the rates of successful 
ablation  were  the  same  (WBS)  or  higher  (Tg  levels)  in  the  euthyroid  group  compared  to  the 
hypothyroid group. However, the results for the FDA-defined endpoint, a commonly used criterion to 
define  successful  remnant  ablation,  and  the  lower  Tg  cut  off  level  (<  1  ng/ml)  were  lower  in  the 
euthyroid  group  and  failed  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  the  euthyroid  group  with  respect  to  the 
hypothyroid group.  
The  MAH  argues  that  there  is  no  consensus  on  the  clinical  significance  of  <0.1%  visible  uptake  on 
WBS in low risk patients, as an uptake in the thyroid bed of less than 0.1% (or even 0.5%) at 48 hours 
is  unlikely  to  represent  residual  cancer  if  the  Tg  levels  are  low.  Study  THYR-008-00  showed  very 
poor  correlation  between  positive  thyroid  bed  uptake  and  the  Tg  levels,  as  most  patients  who  had 
detectable thyroid bed uptake did not have a rise in Tg. One of the published studies cited concluded 
that undetectable serum Tg levels, defined as < 3ng/ml, is highly predictive of complete and persistent 
remission and that persistent areas of visible trace uptake were of clinical significance in only 0.6% (2) 
patients. Following consultation with Radiotherapy Experts this view is accepted by the CHMP as in 
practice, if patients have residual (<0.1%) visible uptake on WBS, physicians increasingly rely upon 
the results of the stimulated Tg level, in the absence of anti Tg antibodies, to determine if significant 
thyroid tissue remains and further therapy is necessary.

Although there is no final answer on whether the 1 or 2 ng/ml cut-off is clinically more relevant, the 
widely accepted value of < 2 ng/ml is considered acceptable by CHMP taking into account that well-
differentiated thyroid cancer is a very uncommon cancer with  only approximately 20,000 new cases 
diagnosed annually in Europe and larger studies may not be feasible. Therefore by the 2 pre-defined 
criteria “no visible uptake or, if visible, <0.1% uptake” on WBS and Thyrogen-stimulated serum Tg 
level of < 2 ng/ml comparable thyroid remnant ablation rates were found in patients prepared for post-
operative 131I therapy by thyroxine withdrawal or by Thyrogen. 
Analyses of radioiodine kinetics showed the MRT was shorter in the euthyroid than the hypothyroid 
group in both whole body and remnant tissue. The MAH states that these results seem to support the 
hypothesis of reduced activity exposure for euthyroid patients. However, the study was not powered 
for statistical analyses of dosimetry parameters or to find differences in 131I kinetics in remnant tissue 
between the 2 groups. Thus, the MAH's suggestion of a theoretical benefit in relation to a lower long-
term risk risk of secondary malignancies due to reduced radiation exposure in the euthyroid group is 
speculative, as no data on long-term risk with Thyrogen have been provided.  
Quality  of  life  was  significantly  reduced  in  the  hypothyroid  group  up  to  1  month  (SF-36)  and  more 
events of cold intolerance; weight increase, constipation, slow movements, cold skin, and periorbital 
puffiness were reported (Billewicz scale). From the clinical perspective this is important, as  patients 
do not tolerate a period of hypothyroidism well and some are unfit to do so.  
Further  efficacy  information  comes  from  4  published  studies,  3  retrospective  and  1  prospective,  in 
which  a  total  of  185  patients  received  Thyrogen  as  adjunct  to  131I  remnant  ablation.  Fifty-seven 
received > 100 mCi  131I and 128 received 30 mCi  131I. The results of the latter group are inferior. In 
this  respect,  the  lower  uptake  and  MRT  time  of  131I  observed  in  remnant  tissue  in  the  pivotal  study 
may  suggest  that  low  doses  of  131I  could  be  less  effective  in  Thyrogen-prepared  compared  to 
hypothyroid patients. Considering that all patients in study THRY-008-00 received an ablative dose of 
100mCi,  efficacy  with  Thyrogen  at  lower  doses  of  131I  has  not  been  established.  This  has  been 
reflected in sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SPC. 
Finally,  study  THYR-008-00  included  only  low  risk  patients.  This  has  been  reflected  in  section  4.1 
and 5.1 of the SPC. 
Safety 
Treatment with Thyrogen  was well  tolerated and  no  safety concerns were identified. This  was to be 
expected  since  the  dose  and  dosing  schedule  are  identical  to  that  approved  for  diagnostic  use.  The 
incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  in  both  groups  and  hence  Thyrogen  does  not  appear  to  be  associated 
with a higher risk of undesirable events compared with remnant ablation in a hypothyroid state. 
3. 
Conclusions and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Thyrogen was originally approved on the basis of a full dossier submitted to support its diagnostic use. 
The  rationale  for  the  proposed  use  in  pre-therapeutic  stimulation  is  the  same.  Globally,  more  than 
100,000 patients  have received Thyrogen for  diagnostic use and the reported safety profile indicates 
that  Thyrogen  is  well  tolerated.  Thyrogen  is  not  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  undesirable  events 
compared with remnant ablation in a hypothyroid state. 
Despite certain statistical limitations due to the small sample size, the results of study THRY-008-00 
are clinically relevant in the intended population, at the intended dose. The applicant has shown that 
Thyrogen  is  effective  for  pre-therapeutic  stimulation  in  post-thyroidectomy  patients  maintained  on 
THST  in  the  ablation  of  thyroid  remnant  tissue  (in  combination)  with  radioactive  iodine  >  100mCi. 
The  rates  of  successful  remnant  ablation  as  determined  by  “no  visible  uptake  or,  if  visible,  <0.1% 
uptake”  on WBS and Thyrogen-stimulated Tg level < 2 ng/ml were comparable to thyroid  hormone 
withdrawal. Moreover,  the  avoidance of a  period  of hypothyroidism  of 4-6 weeks and  its  associated 
morbidity in preparation for ablation therapy is a clear advantage for the affected patients. In addition, 
the use of Thyrogen preparation improves QoL and facilitates treatment planning.

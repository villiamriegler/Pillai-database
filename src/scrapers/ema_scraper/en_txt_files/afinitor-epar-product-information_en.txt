CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced 
breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic 
visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. 
Neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderately-differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease. 
Neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or 
Grade 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with 
progressive disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Renal cell carcinoma 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, whose disease 
has progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Afinitor should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer therapies. 
Posology 
For the different dose regimens Afinitor is available as 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg tablets. 
The recommended dose is 10 mg everolimus once daily. Treatment should continue as long as clinical 
benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the next prescribed dose as 
usual. 
Dose adjustment due to adverse reactions 
Management of severe and/or intolerable suspected adverse reactions may require dose reduction 
and/or temporary interruption of Afinitor therapy. For adverse reactions of Grade 1, dose adjustment is 
usually not required. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose is 5 mg daily and must not 
be lower than 5 mg daily. 
Table 1 summarises the dose adjustment recommendations for specific adverse reactions (see also 
section 4.4).

Dose adjustments should be made if a patient’s hepatic (Child-Pugh) status changes during treatment 
(see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Afinitor in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Afinitor should be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, consistently either with 
or without food (see section 5.2). Afinitor tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. 
The tablets should not be chewed or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Non-infectious pneumonitis 
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. 
Non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) has been frequently reported in 
patients taking Afinitor (see section 4.8). Some cases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal 
outcome was observed. A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough 
or dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-medicinal causes have been excluded 
by means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii 
(carinii) pneumonia (PJP/PCP) should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of non-infectious 
pneumonitis (see “Infections” below). Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms. 
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or 
no symptoms may continue Afinitor therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms are moderate 
(Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms 
resolve. 
For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, 
prophylaxis for PJP/PCP may be considered. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral 
or protozoan infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens (see section 4.8). Localised 
and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections 
such as aspergillosis, candidiasis or PJP/PCP and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B 
virus, have been described in patients taking Afinitor. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. 
leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally fatal. 
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Afinitor. Pre-existing 
infections should be treated appropriately and should have resolved fully before starting treatment 
with Afinitor. While taking Afinitor, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of 
infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation 
of Afinitor. 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, the Afinitor treatment should be promptly 
and permanently discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
Cases of PJP/PCP, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received everolimus. 
PJP/PCP may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive 
agents. Prophylaxis for PJP/PCP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or 
other immunosuppressive agents are required. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, 
dyspnoea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without 
respiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for 
angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) (see 
section 4.5). 
Stomatitis 
Stomatitis, including mouth ulcerations and oral mucositis, is the most commonly reported adverse 
reaction in patients treated with Afinitor (see section 4.8). Stomatitis mostly occurs within the first 
8 weeks of treatment. A single-arm study in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with 
Afinitor plus exemestane suggested that an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution, administered as a 
mouthwash during the initial 8 weeks of treatment, may decrease the incidence and severity of 
stomatitis (see section 5.1). Management of stomatitis may therefore include prophylactic and/or 
therapeutic use of topical treatments, such as an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution as a 
mouthwash. However products containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and thyme derivatives 
should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Monitoring for and treatment of fungal 
infection is recommended, especially in patients being treated with steroid-based medicinal products. 
Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed (see section 4.5). 
Renal failure events 
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in 
patients treated with Afinitor (see section 4.8). Renal function should be monitored particularly where 
patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory tests and monitoring 
Renal function 
Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or 
serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter. 
Blood glucose 
Hyperglycaemia has been reported (see section 4.8). Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is 
recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter. More frequent 
monitoring is recommended when Afinitor is co-administered with other medicinal products that may 
induce hyperglycaemia. When possible optimal glycaemic control should be achieved before starting a 
patient on Afinitor. 
Blood lipids 
Dyslipidaemia (including hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) has been reported. 
Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically 
thereafter, as well as management with appropriate medical therapy, is recommended. 
Haematological parameters 
Decreased haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets have been reported (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and 
periodically thereafter. 
Functional carcinoid tumours 
In a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre trial in patients with functional carcinoid tumours, 
Afinitor plus depot octreotide was compared to placebo plus depot octreotide. The study did not meet 
the primary efficacy endpoint (progression-free-survival [PFS]) and the overall survival (OS) interim 
analysis numerically favoured the placebo plus depot octreotide arm. Therefore, the safety and 
efficacy of Afinitor in patients with functional carcinoid tumours have not been established. 
Prognostic factors in neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin 
In patients with non-functional gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumours and good prognostic 
baseline factors, e.g. ileum as primary tumour origin and normal chromogranin A values or without 
bone involvement, an individual benefit-risk assessment should be performed prior to the start of 
Afinitor therapy. Limited evidence of PFS benefit was reported in the subgroup of patients with ileum 
as primary tumour origin (see section 5.1). 
Interactions 
Co-administration with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or the multidrug efflux pump 
P-glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. If co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP 
inhibitor or inducer cannot be avoided, the clinical condition of the patient should be monitored 
closely. Dose adjustments of Afinitor can be taken into consideration based on predicted AUC (see 
section 4.5). 
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors result in dramatically increased plasma 
concentrations of everolimus (see section 4.5). There are currently not sufficient data to allow dosing 
recommendations in this situation. Hence, concomitant treatment of Afinitor and potent inhibitors is 
not recommended. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caution should be exercised when Afinitor is taken in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index due to the potential for drug interactions. If Afinitor is 
taken with orally administered CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. pimozide, 
terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, quinidine or ergot alkaloid derivatives), the patient should be 
monitored for undesirable effects described in the product information of the orally administered 
CYP3A4 substrate (see section 4.5). 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Afinitor is only recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) if the 
potential benefit outweighs the risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
No clinical safety or efficacy data are currently available to support dose adjustment recommendations 
for the management of adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Vaccinations 
The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Afinitor (see section 4.5). 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Wound healing complications 
Impaired wound healing is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. Caution 
should therefore be exercised with the use of Afinitor in the peri-surgical period. 
Radiation therapy complications 
Serious and severe radiation reactions (such as radiation oesophagitis, radiation pneumonitis and 
radiation skin injury), including fatal cases, have been reported when everolimus was taken during, or 
shortly after, radiation therapy. Caution should therefore be exercised for the potentiation of 
radiotherapy toxicity in patients taking everolimus in close temporal relationship with radiation 
therapy. 
Additionally, radiation recall syndrome (RRS) has been reported in patients taking everolimus who 
had received radiation therapy in the past. In the event of RRS, interrupting or stopping everolimus 
treatment should be considered.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. Therefore, 
absorption and subsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by products that affect 
CYP3A4 and/or PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor 
of CYP2D6. 
Known and theoretical interactions with selected inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and PgP are 
listed in Table 2 below. 
CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors increasing everolimus concentrations 
Substances that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may increase everolimus blood concentrations by 
decreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. 
CYP3A4 and PgP inducers decreasing everolimus concentrations 
Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP may decrease everolimus blood concentrations by 
increasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells.

Use caution when 
co-administration of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP 
inhibitors cannot be avoided. If 
patients require co-administration 
of a moderate CYP3A4 or PgP 
inhibitor, dose reduction to 5 mg 
daily or 2.5 mg daily may be 
considered. However, there are no 
clinical data with this dose 
adjustment. Due to between 
subject variability the 
recommended dose adjustments 
may not be optimal in all 
individuals, therefore close 
monitoring of side effects is 
recommended (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). If the moderate inhibitor is 
discontinued, consider a washout 
period of at least 2 to 3 days 
(average elimination time for most 
commonly used moderate 
inhibitors) before the Afinitor dose 
is returned to the dose used prior to 
initiation of the co-administration. 
Combination should be avoided. 
Avoid the use of concomitant 
potent CYP3A4 inducers. If 
patients require co-administration 
of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, an 
Afinitor dose increase from 10 mg 
daily up to 20 mg daily should be 
considered using 5 mg increments 
or less applied on Day 4 and 8 
following start of the inducer. This 
dose of Afinitor is predicted to 
adjust the AUC to the range 
observed without inducers. 
However, there are no clinical data 
with this dose adjustment. If 
treatment with the inducer is 
discontinued, consider a washout 
period of at least 3 to 5 days 
(reasonable time for significant 
enzyme de-induction), before the 
Afinitor dose is returned to the 
dose used prior to initiation of the 
co-administration. 
Preparations containing St John’s 
Wort should not be used during 
treatment with everolimus 
 
 
Agents whose plasma concentration may be altered by everolimus 
Based on in vitro results, the systemic concentrations obtained after oral daily doses of 10 mg make 
inhibition of PgP, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 unlikely. However, inhibition of CYP3A4 and PgP in the 
gut cannot be excluded. An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration 
of an oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% 
increase in midazolam Cmax and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC(0-inf). The effect is likely to be due 
to inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by everolimus. Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of 
orally co-administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of 
systemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section 4.4). 
Co-administration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide Cmin with a geometric mean 
ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47. A clinically significant effect on the efficacy response to 
everolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours could not be established. 
Co-administration of everolimus and exemestane increased exemestane Cmin and C2h by 45% and 64%, 
respectively. However, the corresponding oestradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different 
between the two treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed 
in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The 
increase in exemestane levels is unlikely to have an impact on efficacy or safety. 
Concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for 
angioedema (see section 4.4). 
Vaccinations 
The immune response to vaccination may be affected and, therefore, vaccination may be less effective 
during treatment with Afinitor. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with 
Afinitor (see section 4.4). Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, 
rubella, oral polio, BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid 
vaccines. 
Radiation treatment 
Potentiation of radiation treatment toxicity has been reported in patients receiving everolimus (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, 
injected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based 
contraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device 
[IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after 
ending treatment. Male patients should not be prohibited from attempting to father children. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The 
potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Everolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus 
and/or its metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus 
should not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 
Fertility 
The potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however 
amenorrhoea (secondary amenorrhoea and other menstrual irregularities) and associated luteinising 
hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) imbalance has been observed in female patients. 
Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with 
everolimus (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Afinitor has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
advised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue during treatment 
with Afinitor. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 2,879 patients treated with Afinitor in eleven clinical 
studies, consisting of five randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III studies and six open-
label phase I and phase II studies, related to the approved indications. 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/10) from the pooled safety data were (in 
decreasing order): stomatitis, rash, fatigue, diarrhoea, infections, nausea, decreased appetite, anaemia, 
dysgeusia, pneumonitis, oedema peripheral, hyperglycaemia, asthenia, pruritus, weight decreased, 
hypercholesterolaemia, epistaxis, cough and headache. 
The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/100 to <1/10) were stomatitis, anaemia, 
hyperglycaemia, infections, fatigue, diarrhoea, pneumonitis, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
dyspnoea, proteinuria, lymphopenia, haemorrhage, hypophosphataemia, rash, hypertension, 
pneumonia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased 
and diabetes mellitus. The grades follow CTCAE Version 3.0 and 4.03. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 presents the frequency category of adverse reactions reported in the pooled analysis 
considered for the safety pooling. Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ 
class and frequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with 
serious cases of hepatitis B reactivation, including fatal outcome. Reactivation of infection is an 
expected event during periods of immunosuppression. 
In clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with renal 
failure events (including fatal outcome) and proteinuria. Monitoring of renal function is recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
In clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases 
of amenorrhoea (secondary amenorrhoea and other menstrual irregularities). 
In clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases 
of PJP/PCP, some with fatal outcome (see section 4.4). 
In clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, angioedema has been reported with and 
without concomitant use of ACE inhibitors (see section 4.4). 
Elderly patients 
In the safety pooling, 37% of the Afinitor-treated patients were ≥65 years of age. The number of 
patients with an adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of the medicinal product was higher in 
patients ≥65 years of age (20% vs. 13%). The most common adverse reactions leading to 
discontinuation were pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease), stomatitis, fatigue and 
dyspnoea. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Reported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 70 mg have been 
given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of 
overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EG02 
Mechanism of action 
Everolimus is a selective mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR is a key 
serine-threonine kinase, the activity of which is known to be upregulated in a number of human 
cancers. Everolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12, forming a complex that inhibits 
mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity. Inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway interferes with 
the translation and synthesis of proteins by reducing the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase 
(S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP-1) that regulate proteins involved 
in the cell cycle, angiogenesis and glycolysis. S6K1is thought to phosphorylate the activation function 
domain 1 of the oestrogen receptor, which is responsible for ligand-independent receptor activation. 
Everolimus reduces levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which potentiates tumour 
angiogenic processes. Everolimus is a potent inhibitor of the growth and proliferation of tumour cells, 
endothelial cells, fibroblasts and blood-vessel-associated smooth muscle cells and has been shown to 
reduce glycolysis in solid tumours in vitro and in vivo. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer 
BOLERO-2 (study CRAD001Y2301), a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase III study of 
Afinitor + exemestane versus placebo + exemestane, was conducted in postmenopausal women with 
oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or 
progression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole. Randomisation was stratified by 
documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy and by the presence of visceral metastasis. 
Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete 
response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease ≥24 weeks) from at least one prior hormonal 
therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to 
recurrence. 
The primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST 
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on the investigator’s assessment (local 
radiology). Supportive PFS analyses were based on an independent central radiology review. 
Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, 
safety, change in quality of life (QoL) and time to ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status) deterioration.

A total of 724 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the combination everolimus (10 mg daily) + 
exemestane (25 mg daily) (n=485) or to the placebo + exemestane arm (25 mg daily) (n=239). At the 
time of the final OS analysis, the median duration of everolimus treatment was 24.0 weeks (range 
1.0-199.1 weeks). The median duration of exemestane treatment was longer in the everolimus + 
exemestane group at 29.5 weeks (1.0-199.1) compared to 14.1 weeks (1.0-156.0) in the placebo + 
exemestane group. 
The efficacy results for the primary endpoint were obtained from the final PFS analysis (see Table 4 
and Figure 1). Patients in the placebo + exemestane arm did not cross over to everolimus at the time of 
progression.

The estimated PFS treatment effect was supported by planned subgroup analysis of PFS per 
investigator assessment. For all analysed subgroups (age, sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, 
number of organs involved, status of bone-only lesions at baseline and presence of visceral metastasis, 
and across major demographic and prognostic subgroups) a positive treatment effect was seen with 
everolimus + exemestane with an estimated hazard ratio (HR) versus placebo + exemestane ranging 
from 0.25 to 0.60. 
No differences in the time to ≥5% deterioration in the global and functional domain scores of 
QLQ-C30 were observed in the two arms. 
BOLERO-6 (Study CRAD001Y2201), a three-arm, randomised, open-label, phase II study of 
everolimus in combination with exemestane versus everolimus alone versus capecitabine in the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative, locally 
advanced, recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer after recurrence or progression on prior letrozole or 
anastrozole. 
The primary objective of the study was to estimate the HR of PFS for everolimus + exemestane versus 
everolimus alone. The key secondary objective was to estimate the HR of PFS for everolimus + 
exemestane versus capecitabine. 
Other secondary objectives included the evaluation of OS, objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, 
safety, time to ECOG performance deterioration, time to QoL deterioration, and treatment satisfaction 
(TSQM). No formal statistical comparisons were planned.

A total of 309 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the combination of everolimus (10 mg 
daily) + exemestane (25 mg daily) (n=104), everolimus alone (10 mg daily) (n=103), or capecitabine 
(1250 mg/m2 dose twice daily for 2 weeks followed by one week rest, 3-week cycle) (n=102). At the 
time of data cut-off, the median duration of treatment was 27.5 weeks (range 2.0-165.7) in the 
everolimus + exemestane arm, 20 weeks (1.3-145.0) in the everolimus arm, and 26.7 weeks 
(1.4-177.1) in the capecitabine arm. 
The result of the final PFS analysis with 154 PFS events observed based on local investigator 
assessment showed an estimated HR of 0.74 (90% CI: 0.57, 0.97) in favour of the everolimus + 
exemestane arm relative to everolimus arm. The median PFS was 8.4 months (90% CI: 6.6, 9.7) and 
6.8 months (90% CI: 5.5, 7.2), respectively.

observed. 
Results of the secondary endpoint OS were not consistent with the primary endpoint PFS, with a trend 
observed favouring the everolimus alone arm. The estimated HR was 1.27 (90% CI: 0.95, 1.70) for the 
comparison of OS in the everolimus alone arm relative to the everolimus + exemestane arm. The 
estimated HR for the comparison of OS in the everolimus + exemestane combination arm relative to

Advanced neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin (pNET) 
RADIANT-3 (study CRAD001C2324), a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study of 
Afinitor plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced pNET, 
demonstrated a statistically significant clinical benefit of Afinitor over placebo by a 2.4-fold 
prolongation of median progression-free-survival (PFS) (11.04 months versus 4.6 months), (HR 0.35; 
95% CI: 0.27, 0.45; p<0.0001) (see Table 5 and Figure 3). 
RADIANT-3 involved patients with well- and moderately-differentiated advanced pNET whose 
disease had progressed within the prior 12 months. Treatment with somatostatin analogues was 
allowed as part of BSC. 
The primary endpoint for the study was PFS evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors). Following documented radiological progression, patients could be unblinded by the 
investigator. Those randomised to placebo were then able to receive open-label Afinitor. 
Secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate, response duration and overall survival 
(OS). 
In total, 410 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either Afinitor 10 mg/day (n=207) or placebo 
(n=203). Demographics were well balanced (median age 58 years, 55% male, 78.5% Caucasian). 
Fifty-eight percent of the patients in both arms received prior systemic therapy. The median duration 
of blinded study treatment was 37.8 weeks (range 1.1-129.9 weeks) for patients receiving everolimus 
and 16.1 weeks (range 0.4-147.0 weeks) for those receiving placebo. 
Following disease progression or after study unblinding, 172 of the 203 patients (84.7%) initially 
randomised to placebo crossed over to open-label Afinitor. The median duration of open-label 
treatment was 47.7 weeks among all patients; 67.1 weeks in the 53 patients randomised to everolimus 
who switched to open-label everolimus and 44.1 weeks in the 172 patients randomised to placebo who 
switched to open-label everolimus.

Advanced neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin 
RADIANT-4 (study CRAD001T2302), a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase III study of 
Afinitor plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC was conducted in patients with 
advanced, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or Grade 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of 
gastrointestinal or lung origin without a history of and no active symptoms related to carcinoid 
syndrome. 
The primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), based on independent radiology assessment. 
Supportive PFS analysis was based on local investigator review. Secondary endpoints included overall 
survival (OS), overall response rate, disease control rate, safety, change in quality of life (FACT-G) 
and time to World Health Organisation performance status (WHO PS) deterioration. 
A total of 302 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either everolimus (10 mg daily) 
(n=205) or placebo (n=97). Demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced 
(median age 63 years [range 22 to 86], 76% Caucasian, history of prior somatostatin analogue [SSA] 
use). The median duration of blinded treatment was 40.4 weeks for patients receiving Afinitor and 
19.6 weeks for those receiving placebo. After primary PFS analysis, 6 patients from the placebo arm 
crossed over to open-label everolimus.

The final overall survival (OS) analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between 
those patients who received Afinitor or placebo during the blinded treatment period of the study 
(HR=0.90 [95% CI: 0.66 to 1.22]). 
No difference in the time to definitive deterioration of WHO PS (HR=1.02; [95% CI: 0.65, 1.61]) and 
time to definitive deterioration in quality of life (FACT-G total score HR=0.74; [95% CI: 0.50, 1.10]) 
was observed between the two arms.

Advanced renal cell carcinoma 
RECORD-1 (study CRAD001C2240), a phase III, international, multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind study comparing everolimus 10 mg/day and placebo, both in conjunction with best 
supportive care, was conducted in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had 
progressed on or after treatment with VEGFR-TKI (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sunitinib and sorafenib). Prior therapy 
with bevacizumab and interferon-α was also permitted. Patients were stratified according to Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic score (favourable- vs. intermediate- vs. poor-risk 
groups) and prior anticancer therapy (1 vs. 2 prior VEGFR-TKIs). 
Progression-free survival, documented using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours) and assessed via a blinded, independent central review, was the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints included safety, objective tumour response rate, overall survival, disease-related 
symptoms, and quality of life. After documented radiological progression, patients could be unblinded 
by the investigator: those randomised to placebo were then able to receive open-label everolimus 
10 mg/day. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended termination of this trial at the 
time of the second interim analysis as the primary endpoint had been met. 
In total, 416 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Afinitor (n=277) or placebo (n=139). 
Demographics were well balanced (pooled median age [61 years; range 27-85], 78% male, 88% 
Caucasian, number of prior VEGFR-TKI therapies [1-74%, 2-26%]). The median duration of blinded 
study treatment was 141 days (range 19-451 days) for patients receiving everolimus and 60 days 
(range 21-295 days) for those receiving placebo. 
Afinitor was superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, with a 
statistically significant 67% reduction in the risk of progression or death (see Table 7 and Figure 6).

Time (months) 
Six-month PFS rates were 36% for Afinitor therapy compared with 9% for placebo. 
Confirmed objective tumour responses were observed in 5 patients (2%) receiving Afinitor, while 
none were observed in patients receiving placebo. Therefore, the progression-free survival advantage 
primarily reflects the population with disease stabilisation (corresponding to 67% of the Afinitor 
treatment group). 
No statistically significant treatment-related difference in overall survival was noted (hazard 
ratio 0.87; confidence interval: 0.65-1.17; p=0.177). Crossover to open-label Afinitor following 
disease progression for patients allocated to placebo confounded the detection of any treatment-related 
difference in overall survival. 
Other studies 
Stomatitis is the most commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with Afinitor (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). In a post-marketing single-arm study in postmenopausal women with advanced 
breast cancer (N=92), topical treatment with dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml alcohol-free oral solution 
was administered as a mouthwash (4 times daily for the initial 8 weeks of treatment) to patients at the 
time of initiating treatment with Afinitor (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) to reduce the 
incidence and severity of stomatitis. The incidence of Grade ≥2 stomatitis at 8 weeks was 2.4% 
(n=2/85 evaluable patients) which was lower than historically reported. The incidence of Grade 1 
stomatitis was 18.8% (n=16/85) and no cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. The overall 
safety profile in this study was consistent with that established for everolimus in the oncology and 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) settings, with the exception of a slightly increased frequency of oral 
candidiasis which was reported in 2.2% (n=2/92) of patients. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Afinitor in all subsets of the paediatric population in neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin, 
thoracic neuroendocrine tumours and in renal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In patients with advanced solid tumours, peak everolimus concentrations (Cmax) are reached at a 
median time of 1 hour after daily administration of 5 and 10 mg everolimus under fasting conditions 
or with a light fat-free snack. Cmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. Everolimus is a substrate 
and moderate inhibitor of PgP. 
Food effect 
In healthy subjects, high fat meals reduced systemic exposure to everolimus 10 mg (as measured by 
AUC) by 22% and the peak plasma concentration Cmax by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by 32% 
and Cmax by 42%. Food, however, had no apparent effect on the post absorption phase 
concentration-time profile. 
Distribution 
The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 
5,000 ng/ml, is 17% to 73%. Approximately 20% of the everolimus concentration in whole blood is 
confined to plasma in cancer patients given everolimus 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is 
approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In 
patients with advanced solid tumours, Vd was 191 l for the apparent central compartment and 517 l for 
the apparent peripheral compartment. 
Biotransformation 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main 
circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in 
human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, 
and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal 
species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus 
itself. Hence, everolimus is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacological 
activity. 
Elimination 
Mean oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus after 10 mg daily dose in patients with advanced solid 
tumours was 24.5 l/h. The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. 
No specific excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; however, data are available 
from the studies in transplant patients. Following the administration of a single dose of radiolabelled 
everolimus in conjunction with ciclosporin, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the faeces, 
while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or faeces. 
Steady-state pharmacokinetics 
After administration of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumours, steady-state AUC0-τ was 
dose-proportional over the range of 5 to 10 mg daily dose. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks. 
Cmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. tmax occurs at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. There was a 
significant correlation between AUC0-τ and pre-dose trough concentration at steady-state. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of everolimus were evaluated in two single oral dose 
studies of Afinitor tablets in 8 and 34 subjects with impaired hepatic function relative to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. 
In the first study, the average AUC of everolimus in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh B) was twice that found in 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. 
In the second study of 34 subjects with different impaired hepatic function compared to normal 
subjects, there was a 1.6-fold, 3.3-fold and 3.6-fold increase in exposure (i.e. AUC0-inf) for subjects 
with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, 
respectively. 
Simulations of multiple dose pharmacokinetics support the dosing recommendations in subjects with 
hepatic impairment based on their Child-Pugh status. 
Based on the results of the two studies, dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 patients with advanced solid tumours, no significant 
influence of creatinine clearance (25-178 ml/min) was detected on CL/F of everolimus. Post-transplant 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance range 11-107 ml/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
everolimus in transplant patients. 
Elderly patients 
In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in cancer patients, no significant influence of age 
(27-85 years) on oral clearance of everolimus was detected. 
Ethnicity 
Oral clearance (CL/F) is similar in Japanese and Caucasian cancer patients with similar liver 
functions. Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, CL/F is on average 20% higher in black 
transplant patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The preclinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipigs, monkeys and rabbits. 
The major target organs were male and female reproductive systems (testicular tubular degeneration, 
reduced sperm content in epididymides and uterine atrophy) in several species; lungs (increased 
alveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; pancreas (degranulation and vacuolation of exocrine cells in 
monkeys and minipigs, respectively, and degeneration of islet cells in monkeys), and eyes (lenticular 
anterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney changes were seen in the rat (exacerbation of 
age-related lipofuscin in tubular epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse (exacerbation of 
background lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys or minipigs. 
Everolimus appeared to spontaneously exacerbate background diseases (chronic myocarditis in rats, 
coxsackie virus infection of plasma and heart in monkeys, coccidian infestation of the gastrointestinal 
tract in minipigs, skin lesions in mice and monkeys). These findings were generally observed at 
systemic exposure levels within the range of therapeutic exposure or above, with the exception of the 
findings in rats, which occurred below therapeutic exposure due to a high tissue distribution. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm 
motility, sperm head count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a 
reduction in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility. 
In animal reproductive studies female fertility was not affected. However, oral doses of everolimus in 
female rats at ≥0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% of the AUC0-24h in patients receiving the 10 mg daily 
dose) resulted in increases in pre-implantation loss. 
Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the foetus. In rats, everolimus caused 
embryo/foetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the therapeutic level. This was manifested as 
mortality and reduced foetal weight. The incidence of skeletal variations and malformations (e.g. 
sternal cleft) was increased at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg. In rabbits, embryotoxicity was evident in an increase 
in late resorptions. 
Genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of clastogenic or 
mutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate any oncogenic 
potential in mice and rats up to the highest doses, corresponding respectively to 3.9 and 0.2 times the 
estimated clinical exposure.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Afinitor is and what it is used for 
Afinitor is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance everolimus. Everolimus reduces the 
blood supply to the tumour and slows down the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
Afinitor is used to treat adult patients with: 
− 
hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, in whom other 
treatments (so called “non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors”) no longer keep the disease under 
control. It is given together with a medicine called exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, 
which is used for hormonal anticancer therapy. 
advanced tumours called neuroendocrine tumours that originate from the stomach, bowels, lung 
or pancreas. It is given if the tumours are inoperable and do not overproduce specific hormones 
or other related natural substances. 
advanced kidney cancer (advanced renal cell carcinoma), where other treatments (so-called 
“VEGF-targeted therapy”) have not helped stop your disease. 
− 
− 
2.  What you need to know before you take Afinitor 
Afinitor will only be prescribed for you by a doctor with experience in cancer treatment. Follow all the 
doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained in this leaflet. 
If you have any questions about Afinitor or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor. 
Do not take Afinitor 
− 
if you are allergic to everolimus, to related substances such as sirolimus or temsirolimus, or to 
any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Afinitor: 
• 
if you have any problems with your liver or if you have ever had any disease which may have 
affected your liver. If this is the case, your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of 
Afinitor. 
if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). Afinitor may increase blood sugar 
levels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in the need for insulin and/or oral 
antidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased 
frequency of urination. 
if you need to receive a vaccine while taking Afinitor. 
if you have high cholesterol. Afinitor may elevate cholesterol and/or other blood fats. 
if you have had recent major surgery, or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery. 
Afinitor may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. 
if you have an infection. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Afinitor. 
if you have previously had hepatitis B, because this may be reactivated during treatment with 
Afinitor (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). 
if you have received or are about to receive radiation therapy. 
Afinitor may also: 
• 
weaken your immune system. Therefore, you may be at risk of getting an infection while you 
are taking Afinitor. If you have fever or other signs of an infection, consult with your doctor. 
Some infections may be severe and may have fatal consequences. 
impact your kidney function. Therefore, your doctor will monitor your kidney function while 
you are taking Afinitor. 
cause shortness of breath, cough and fever. 
cause mouth ulcers and sores to develop. Your doctor might need to interrupt or discontinue 
your treatment with Afinitor. You might need treatment with a mouthwash, gel or other 
products. Some mouthwashes and gels can make ulcers worse, so do not try anything without 
checking with your doctor first. Your doctor might restart treatment with Afinitor at the same 
dose or at a lower dose. 
cause complications of radiation therapy. Severe complications of radiotherapy (such as 
shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhoea, skin rashes and soreness in mouth, gums and throat), 
including fatal cases, have been observed in some patients who were taking everolimus at the 
same time as radiation therapy or who were taking everolimus shortly after they had radiation 
therapy. In addition, so-called radiation recall syndrome (comprising skin redness or lung 
inflammation at the site of previous radiation therapy) has been reported in patients who had 
radiation therapy in the past. 
Tell your doctor if you are planning to have radiation therapy in the near future, or if you have 
had radiation therapy before. 
Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. 
You will have regular blood tests during treatment. These will check the amount of blood cells (white 
blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in your body to see if Afinitor is having an unwanted effect 
on these cells. Blood tests will also be carried out to check your kidney function (level of creatinine) 
and liver function (level of transaminases) and your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. This is because 
these can also be affected by Afinitor. 
Children and adolescents 
Afinitor is not to be used in children or adolescents (age below 18 years). 
Other medicines and Afinitor 
Afinitor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are taking other medicines at the same 
time as Afinitor, your doctor may need to change the dose of Afinitor or the other medicines. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
The following may increase the risk of side effects with Afinitor: 
• 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole and other antifungals used to treat 
fungal infections. 
clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. 
ritonavir and other medicines used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. 
verapamil or diltiazem, used to treat heart conditions or high blood pressure. 
dronedarone, a medicine used to help regulate your heart beat. 
ciclosporin, a medicine used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants. 
imatinib, used to inhibit the growth of abnormal cells. 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as ramipril) used to treat high blood 
pressure or other cardiovascular problems. 
nefazodone, used to treat depression. 
cannabidiol (uses amongst others include treatment of seizures). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The following may reduce the effectiveness of Afinitor: 
• 
rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB). 
• 
efavirenz or nevirapine, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. 
• 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression and other 
conditions. 
dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of conditions including 
inflammatory or immune problems. 
phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or fits. 
• 
• 
These medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Afinitor. If you are taking any of them, 
your doctor may switch you to a different medicine, or may change your dose of Afinitor. 
Afinitor with food and drink 
Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are on Afinitor. It may increase the amount of Afinitor 
in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
Afinitor could harm your unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you 
should take this medicine during your pregnancy. 
Women who could potentially become pregnant should use highly effective contraception during 
treatment and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment. If, despite these measures, you think you may 
have become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before taking any more Afinitor. 
Breast-feeding 
Afinitor could harm your breast-fed baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment and for 
2 weeks after the last dose of Afinitor. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. 
Female fertility 
Absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhoea) has been observed in some female patients receiving 
Afinitor. 
Afinitor may have an impact on female fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to have children. 
Male fertility 
Afinitor may affect male fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to father a child. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
If you feel unusually tired (fatigue is a very common side effect), take special care when driving or 
using machines. 
Afinitor contains lactose 
Afinitor contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
3. 
How to take Afinitor

or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is 10 mg, taken once a day. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets of 
Afinitor to take. 
If you have liver problems, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of Afinitor (2.5, 5 or 7.5 mg per 
day). 
If you experience certain side effects while you are taking Afinitor (see section 4), your doctor may 
lower your dose or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently.

Swallow the tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. 
If you take more Afinitor than you should 
•

doctor or go to a hospital immediately. Urgent treatment may be necessary. 
Take the carton and this leaflet, so that the doctor knows what has been taken. 
• 
If you forget to take Afinitor 
If you miss a dose, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for the

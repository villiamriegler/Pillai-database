2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Xenleta is proposed for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Populations at risk for CAP include the elderly, patients who smoke, suffer from alcoholism, patients with 
underlying comorbidities (such as COPD, chronic heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and having a history of 
cerebrovascular disease/stroke) and those with recent hospital, healthcare or nursing home exposure. Given 
the increasing numbers of older patients hospitalised in the EU with CAP, it is expected that the burden of 
CAP will increase. Further amplifying the burden of illness, up to 33% of patients have a cardiac complication 
within 30 days of hospitalisation, with an increased risk persisting at 1 year and possibly even up to 10 years 
after the CAP event.  
Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CAP, it remains associated with high morbidity, mortality, 
and healthcare expenditures globally. Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study reported that 
lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, were the third most common cause of death 
worldwide and the most common cause of infectious death globally, claiming 3 million lives annually. The 
impact on morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia is magnified in older 
groups, where data have shown that mortality is associated with advancing age. Approximately 90% of 
deaths due to pneumonia occur in people aged greater than 65 years. Annually, inpatient costs of pneumonia 
are estimated as €2.5 billion. Estimation of other direct and indirect costs of pneumonia/acute lower 
respiratory infections, including the cost of lost projected disability-adjusted life-years, are €43.5 billion. 
While data are available from prospective studies and national databases, it remains difficult to determine the 
clinical and economic burden of CAP in the EU. Finland, Spain, and the UK remain the only countries to have 
precise epidemiologic data on CAP. Differences in study populations and methods for quantifying incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 11/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pose challenges for comparisons across studies. Approximately 3,370,000 cases of pneumonia occur annually 
in the EU. The incidence of all-cause pneumonia in the EU ranged from 68-7000 per 100,000 persons but this 
varied by country, age, group, study and time-period. The incidence in hospitalised CAP of all causes ranged 
from 16-3581 per 100,000 persons and the incidence increased consistently with age within the EU. In 
Finland, the incidence of CAP increased six-fold when comparing patients aged 30-44 years and those aged 
>75 years. The mortality rate for CAP was 9.1%, with ranges varying widely from <1% to as high as 48%, 
especially when patients with CAP are treated in the intensive care unit. A long-term follow-up study found 
that elderly patients treated for CAP in both ambulatory and hospital settings had significantly higher risks of 
death and death related to pneumonia and cardiovascular conditions for several years following a diagnosis of 
pneumonia than the elderly without pneumonia. 
Limited data are available on health-related quality of life (HRQL) following CAP infection and only a few 
studies have been published with follow-up extending beyond 6 weeks after CAP infection. In 3 published 
reports in which HRQL was followed from 1 to 1.5 years post CAP diagnosis, HRQL was diminished (e.g. 
reduced Short Form-36 Item Health Survey scores in physical function and general health; problems noted in 
all 5 domains of EQ-5D) throughout the duration of each study. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Despite advances in diagnostic technology, a microbiological diagnosis is infrequently confirmed in cases of 
CAP although the microbiological diagnosis of CAP is necessary to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy. 
The microbial diagnosis of pneumonia is achieved in less than half of presenting cases and antimicrobial 
therapy should be empirically started to avoid the delay in establishing appropriate therapy, which has been 
associated with increased mortality. In the EU, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae ranged from 19%-34%. The 
primary factors that confound these conventional methods of microbial detection in patients with CAP are the 
low yield, long turnaround time and previous antibiotic use.  
A population-based surveillance study conducted by the US CDC found that among 2259 patients with 
radiographic evidence of CAP and specimens available for testing, only 38% of cases yielded any pathogen 
and only 14% yielded a bacterial pathogen. Although a definitive microbiological diagnosis is made in the 
minority of patients with CAP, when a pathogen is identified, the majority are caused by one of a handful of 
microorganisms, mainly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and other Gram-negative aerobes. Additionally, there 
is increasing incidence with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as a post-influenza, 
secondary, bacterial pathogen causing CAP. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Community-acquired pneumonia is characterised by acute signs and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract 
infection, with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray not attributable to other aetiologies. Patients typically 
develop fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough, increased sputum production, shortness of breath, 
chest pain. However, in subgroups of patients (e.g. elderly) typical signs and symptoms may be absent and 
atypical symptoms such as altered consciousness may be more prevalent, delaying diagnosis. As a result, the 
definitive diagnosis of pneumonia rests primarily on a thorough medical history, clinical evaluation and 
imaging studies that document the presence of lung infiltrates.

2.1.5.  Management 
In 2011, a collaboration between the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and The European Society for 
Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published updated European guidelines for the 
treatment of CAP. The recommendation for outpatients was use of either amoxicillin or tetracycline as 
monotherapy, and for patients with hypersensitivity to amoxicillin, a tetracycline or macrolide should be 
prescribed; however, regional, macrolide resistance rates to S. pneumoniae need to be considered. When 
resistance rates are clinically relevant, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) can be 
used. 
For hospitalised patients not considered severe, penicillin G ± macrolide, an aminopenicillin (amoxicillin) ± 
macrolide, an aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ± macrolide), a non-
antipseudomonal, third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone ± macrolide or a 
respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) can be given. The ERS/ESCMID guidelines suggest 
that combination therapy should be restricted to patients with severe presentation of CAP, with combination 
therapy being the treatment of choice for patients with severe CAP being treated in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). Additional areas of concern for clinicians include lack of coverage with first line therapy options and 
cross resistance to community acquired (CA) MRSA strains, multi-drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and overuse 
of fluoroquinolones being a primary driver towards increasing resistance in gram negative bacteria. 
Broadly, treatment of CAP is complicated by 3 issues: infrequent identification of causative pathogens, 
resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotic therapies and adverse effects of the medications. In addition, 
broad spectrum antibiotic therapy also can cause 'collateral damage' on enteric and other normal flora 
bacterial populations increasing risk of diarrhoea (including Clostridioides difficile [formerly Clostridium 
difficile] related), selection of resistance in other pathogens and risk of fungal overgrowth and infections. 
Macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae is at least 15% in the European Union (EU) and the US and is 
approaching 100% in Asia. Increased rates of resistance have also been reported for fluoroquinolones, 
another commonly prescribed antibiotic therapy for CAP. Although the IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend 
initiating treatment of CAP with macrolides, resistance among S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae isolates to 
this class has been increasingly reported worldwide. Approximately 50% of S. pneumoniae strains are 
resistant to macrolides in the US with rates varying significantly by geographic region. 
In addition to increasing resistance, the most frequently used CAP therapies, including β-lactams, macrolides 
and fluoroquinolones, are associated with clinically important adverse effects. β-lactam use (e.g. ceftriaxone) 
is commonly associated with adverse events (AEs) including allergic reactions and gastrointestinal, 
hematologic, hepatobiliary and neurological effects. Common adverse effects associated with macrolides 
include gastrointestinal side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting and risk of QT prolongation. 
Fluoroquinolone use has recently become more restricted due to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-associated 
disability (FQAD), which includes tiredness, concentration problems, neuropathies, tendinopathies, and other 
symptoms, which may persist after discontinuation of the offending fluoroquinolone.

About the product 
Lefamulin has in-vitro activity against all of the most common pathogens associated with CAP (including S. 
pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae). It is also 
active against S. aureus. The recommended duration of treatment for lefamulin is 5 to 7 days. The lefamulin 
clinical development programme included 24 Phase 1 studies, one Phase 2 study in ABSSSI and two Phase 3 
studies in CAP. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was primarily based on the lack of an unmet need with 
respect to available treatments for community-acquired pneumonia.

3aH-cyclopentacycloocten-8-yl ester corresponding to the molecular formula C28H45NO5S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 507.74 (free base) g/mol. Lefamulin is available in the form of an acetic acid salt (acetate) 
with a molecular weight of 567.79 g/mol and the molecular formula of C30H49NO7S. Lefamulin acetate has the 
following structure: 
Figure 1. Active substance structure 
Lefamulin acetate is a single stereoisomer semi-synthetically derived from pleuromutilin, a homochiral, 
natural fermentation product of known absolute stereochemistry. Lefamulin acetate is a diastereomer with R-
configuration at carbons of the cyclohexane moiety. The absolute configuration of the active substance has 
been confirmed by single crystal structure determination. 
The structure of the active substance lefamulin acetate has been elucidated by a combination of the following 
methods: UV-VIS, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS, elemental analysis, XRPD and single crystal structure 
determination.  
Lefamulin acetate is a white to off-white solid. It is a stable compound (requiring no special storage 
conditions) which is highly soluble in water and 0.9% sodium chloride solution (>300mg/ml). The hydration 
level of lefamulin acetate at ambient conditions is typically below 1% w/w.  
Two polymorphic forms are observed (Form A and Form B), both being crystalline. The manufacturing 
process yields the thermodynamically more stable Form B. FTIR is used to distinguish between Form A and B.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lefamulin active substance is manufactured in seven main steps from well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Pleuromutilin is a key intermediate in the manufacture of the active substance.  
A detailed synthetic scheme and a narrative, including IPCs, were provided. Process parameters, including 
quantities of materials, batch size and process yields were presented for each step.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered to be 
acceptable.

Pleuromutilin intermediate 
Pleuromutilin is a key intermediate used for manufacture of the active substance. Pleuromutilin is a 
homochiral product of natural fermentation manufactured in a three-stage process by fermentation, 
extraction and crystallisation. The fermentation process is standard. In general, the fermentation process is 
adequately described and includes appropriate IPCs. Suitable process parameters are assigned for 
temperature, pressure and aeration of the fermentation broth and culture duration. 
Information with respect to the source, generation and characterisation of the starting material cell bank 
Clitopilus scyphoides var intermedius has been provided. The applicant provided results of the validation of 
the Pleuromutilin fermentation process. In process control results were provided and all complied with limits. 
The process has been demonstrated to be valid. The applicant provided a confirmation that there have been 
no significant manufacturing changes since the transfer of manufacture to the commercial site. During the 
procedure the dossier has been updated to include an overview and discussion of potential impurities coming 
from the fermentation batch. The applicant considers that all impurities would be successfully removed during 
the manufacturing process, either as water-soluble materials, or as insoluble extracts. Data has been 
presented to demonstrate that mycotoxins are not present in batches of crude and purified pleuromutilin 
which supports that these batches are free of aflatoxin B1.The risk of carry forward of any cell debris is low 
based on the numerous filtration and extraction steps at subsequent steps of the active substance 
manufacturing process. Discussion on the formation and purge of organic impurities in pleuromutilin has also 
been provided. Chemical impurities have been characterised and their origin and fate understood. All known 
impurities are controlled and their limits are in line with batch data. 
The applicant was requested to discuss whether the change in manufacturer, from phase 3 manufacturing 
site to the proposed commercial manufacturing site, has an impact on the biological impurity profile, in order 
to ensure comparability between the pleuromutilin materials used for manufacture of phase 3 vs proposed 
commercial active substance batches. The applicant asserts that due to similarities in solvent properties, the 
impurity profiles are expected to be comparable between the different processes, however no information has 
been provided on how the solvents are considered to be similar with respect to ability to purge biological 
impurities. Nevertheless it is agreed that given the number of further processing steps, and the nature of 
solvents used in the manufacturing process for this semi-synthetic product of fermentation, the likelihood of 
proteinaceous materials remaining present in the final active substance is small. Comparative batch analysis 
data from the previous supplier and the current supplier indicate the chemical impurity profiles between the 
two suppliers is comparable and batch analysis data for the drug substance used in clinical trials and for 
registration is similar. 
The structure of pleuromutilin intermediate has been confirmed using the following methods: elemental 
analysis, UV, IR, NMR and MS. Single crystal X-ray analysis was used to confirm that pleuromutilin had the 
desired molecular structure and stereochemistry. A satisfactory specification for pleuromutilin is applied by 
both the pleuromutilin manufacturer and the active substance manufacturer. The chirality of the intermediate 
is controlled by optical purity. Residual solvents are suitably controlled and a limit for sulphated ash ensures 
control of inorganic impurities. Pleuromutilin is placed in PE bags for storage. 
Stability studies on 3 commercial batches have been conducted at ICH long term (25°C / 60% RH) and 
accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH). The batches remain within specification for 6 months at accelerated 
Assessment report

conditions and for 18 months at long-term. Based on the data provided a retest period of 18 months with no 
special storage conditions for the Pleuromutilin intermediate was accepted. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial manufacturing process for the lefamulin active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. It was confirmed that the overall synthetic strategy is unchanged since the 
manufacture of the Clinical Phase 3 batches. The quality of the active substance used from phase 3 of the 
development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. The 
manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of QbD such as risk assessment followed by design of experiment (DOE) studies. All process 
parameters in the lefamulin manufacturing process have a defined normal operating range (NOR) and some 
parameters also have a proven acceptable range (PAR). In the initial MAA submission, a major objection was 
raised as no clear information to support/justify the inclusion of these PARs was provided, and in particular, 
an absence of interaction studies was a concern as several PARs are listed for each step/series of steps. The 
applicant’s response to the major objection largely supported a flexible description of the manufacturing 
process, i.e. the declared PARs could form the basis of a Design Space. However, the applicant clarified that 
since an absence of interaction effects with the other PARs have not been fully demonstrated, a Design Space 
is not claimed. The applicant instead confirmed they will follow the ICH Q8 definition, whereby only a single 
parameter may be varied within the PAR when all others are operated at the NOR. The dossier has been 
updated to clearly state this.  
Characterisation 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The approach taken when setting related substance specifications for intermediates and in the active 
substance is acceptable. The origin, fate and control of potential impurities are discussed. Impurity profiles of 
active substance stability batches are consistent and no degradation products are seen at long term or 
accelerated conditions. 
Two confirmed genotoxic impurities are routinely controlled in the intermediate at an appropriate limit (ICH 
M7). Potential GTIs were also discussed. In line with EMA Information on nitrosamines for MA holders 
(EMA/189634/2019), the applicant submitted a risk assessment and evaluation of the risk regarding potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance. No risk of nitrosamines is determined. 
No elements as defined in ICH Q3D are intentionally added in the active substance manufacturing process. 
Analysis of active substance, in line with ICH Q3D, found the relevant elemental impurities were well below 
30 % of the ICH limit. A test for residue on ignition is included in the active substance specification. 
Batch analysis data demonstrates that most of the class 2 and 3 solvents used prior to the final synthetic 
step are 10% (or less) of their ICH limits. Two class 3 solvents, which will be routinely controlled in the active 
substance, are used in the final synthetic step. The control of solvents is acceptable.

Packaging 
A sufficiently detailed description of the packaging materials is provided. The active substance is packaged in 
LDPE bags/sleeves in HDPE containers which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description (visual), identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), acetic acid content (titration), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.) and endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The tests and acceptance criteria are considered acceptable. Identification is confirmed by FTIR and HPLC. FTIR 
also serves to confirm the correct polymorphic form (Form B). In response to a request to tighten the assay 
limit  in  line  with  batch  data,  the  applicant  tightened  the  specification.  When  more  batches  are  available, 
narrowing further should be considered. 
The proposed limit for individual unspecified impurities has been adequately justified. Impurities present at 
higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical 
studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Limits for genotoxic impurities are not included in the active substance specification as they are routinely 
controlled in the intermediate at appropriate limits. Supporting batch data in combination with the controls 
for chiral purity in the starting material and intermediate mean that routine control of the lefamulin 
diastereomer impurity in the active substance is not considered necessary. The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 9 batches of the active substance are provided (5 clinical Phase 3 batches, 3 
registration batches and 1 pre-validation engineering batch). The results comply with the specifications and 
are consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 5 batches of active substance (2 Phase 3 clinical and 3 registration batches; the latter 
ones from the proposed manufacturer) stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The clinical batches are considered representative of the 
commercial product. 
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurities, acetic acid, ID by IR, water, microbial purity and 
endotoxins. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH Q1B guideline was performed on one batch. All tested parameters 
were within the specifications. Impurity levels do not change and there is no evidence of any trends.

Results on stress conditions (temperature, humidity (80°C / 80%RH), light (UVA & cool white fluorescent), 
acidic (1M HCl), basic (1M NaOH), oxidising (1M H2O2)) were also provided on one batch, confirming the 
stability indicating nature of the HPLC impurities method. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed container with no 
special storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product (Xenleta 600 mg film-coated tablets) 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Xenleta 600 mg film-coated tablets are blue, oval, film-coated tablets with ‘LEF 600’ printed in black on one 
side. Xenleta tablets are supplied in opaque Aclar [PVC/PE/PCTFE] blisters with aluminium foil lidding 
containing 10 tablets. 
The theoretical quantity of the active substance lefamulin acetate is 671 mg. Since the oral dose of lefamulin 
is 600 mg free base the actual quantity of salt in the formula is calculated on the assay value of the active 
substance. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur or other 
relevant Pharmacopoeial standards (USP / USP-NF / JP). There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of 
this report. 
While the applicant did not present a quality target product profile per se, the account of formulation 
development specifies the properties required throughout. While the dosage form necessitated a switch from 
200 mg capsule to 600 mg tablet, and the target dissolution specification had to be modified as a result, 
development was consistent with respect to the size and weight required and the immediate release of the 
formulation. 
Formulation development was clear and logical and sufficient detail was given on how the process 
progressed. The applicant described that a number of clinical Phase I studies were carried out using the 
capsule formulation whilst others were conducted using the first tablet formulation (phase 1). Following tablet 
optimisation and upscaling, a phase 1 BA/BE study and two phase 3 studies were conducted using the tablet 
with the final formulation (Phase 3). Following this, the appearance and manufacturing process of the film-
coated tablet were amended again for the registration batches. 
The applicant discussed pharmacokinetic data of different formulations. Bioequivalence study NAB-BC-3781-
1107 compared the phase I capsule formulation with tablets used in phase 3 clinical trials. Lefamulin 
exposures after oral administration were found to be similar – with similar Cmax, tmax, and AUC0-24 values. The 
applicant also stated that the clinical efficacy of the tablets used in phase 3 was confirmed in study NAB-BC-
3781-3102; this has been addressed in the clinical section of this report.  
Dissolution data comparing the batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to the registration batches was 
provided at 0.1N HCl (the proposed QC release medium) and at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. The graphs show 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020

profiles at all pHs to be similar, as supported by f2 values, which are all higher than 50. This is considered 
sufficient to demonstrate that the batches used in pivotal clinical trials are sufficiently similar to the 
registration batches. Based on the provided data, the formulation used during clinical studies is considered to 
be representative as that intended for marketing. 
Physico-chemical  properties  of  the  active  substance  which  could  potentially  affect  the  formulation  were 
investigated by the applicant. It was demonstrated that the polymorphic form of choice (Form B) of lefamulin 
is  unchanged  as  a  result  of  the  manufacturing  process.  A  justification  of  the  proposed  dissolution  method 
parameters was provided by the applicant. The dissolution profiles of different aberrant batches were used by 
the  applicant  to  demonstrate  the  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution  method.  Regarding  manufacturing 
process  development,  the  choice  of  granulation  is  sufficiently  justified.  Some  details  of  improvement  or 
adjustment of the process were described in formulation development between the process used for the batches 
used in clinical phase 3 studies and that used to manufacture registration batches. The primary packaging is 
PVC/PE/PCTFE / Aluminium (Aclar) blisters with 10 film-coated tablets. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  seven  main  steps:  granulation,  blending,  lubrication,  compression, 
coating, printing and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The in-
process controls and critical process parameters have been identified and are considered adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Data from development batches have been provided which demonstrate that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The applicant has 
submitted a validation protocol for commercial scale manufacture in line with Annex I of the EMA Guideline 
on process validation for finished products - information and data to be provided in regulatory submissions 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1, Corr.1). This is considered satisfactory. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; 
appearance (visual), identity (HPLC, FTIR), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release parameters, through traditional 
final product release testing. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The maximum daily dose of the Xenleta tablets is 1200 mg. Based on this, the thresholds in line with the 
EU/ICH Q3B (R2) guideline for individual unknown impurity is NMT 2 mg (0.167%). During the procedure, 
the proposed limits for water content, total impurities and dissolution have been tightened. The applicant was 
asked to justify the dissolution specification limit in line with the Ph Eur monograph for immediate release

tablets and EMA reflection paper on setting dissolution specifications. The dissolution specification limit has 
been sufficiently justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using 
a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it 
can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
In line with EMA Information on nitrosamines for MA holders (EMA/189634/2019), the applicant submitted a 
risk assessment and evaluation of the risk regarding potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product. No risk of nitrosamines is determined. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three registration batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term  conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches of Xenleta are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
In addition, further supportive stability data from five batches (including four clinical Phase 3 batches and one 
engineering batch) stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) were provided. 
These batches of Xenleta are representative to those proposed for marketing, although some were packed in 
different primary packaging than the Aclar blisters proposed for marketing (i.e. Alu/Alu and PVC/Alu).  
Samples were tested in line with the specifications. While some of the historic acceptance criteria were different 
to  those  finally  agreed  (i.e.  appearance,  individual  impurity,  total  impurities,  dissolution),  the  analytical 
procedures used were stability indicating and representative of the proposed finished product specification.  
No trends of concern have been observed in the stability data and no significant changes were seen throughout 
the studies. There is an uptake of water throughout storage. The highest increase occurs with PVC/Alu blisters 
and the smallest increase occurs in Alu/Alu. The data shows that both Aclar and Alu/Alu are equally protective 
of  the  finished  product  with  respect  to  water  content  and  related  substances.  On  long-term  stability  in  the 
commercial Aclar blisters, the water content increased but stayed well below the revised specification limit.  
The applicant performed a photostability study on bulk tablets and tablets in Aclar blister in line with the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. All stability acceptance criteria were 
met  for  all  investigated  conditions.  The  data  confirm  that  Xenleta  tablets  are  not  prone  to  light  induced 
degradation. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
Non-Viral Adventitious Agents 
Lefamulin acetate is a semi-synthetic molecule. Pleuromutilin, the key intermediate and first starting material 
for chemical synthesis in the lefamulin acetate active substance manufacture, is derived from the fungus 
Clitopilus scyphoides var intermedius by fermentation. Confirmation that there is no risk associated with 
adventitious agent contamination of this material is provided via TSE certification by the pleuromutilin 
manufacturer. 
Viral Adventitious Agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used in the manufacture of active substance or 
finished product. 
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product (Xenleta 150 mg/15 mL concentrate and 
solvent) 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Xenleta concentrate and solvent is supplied as a kit, containing 2 vials of concentrate and 2 bags of solvent 
for solution for infusion. 
Xenleta 150 mg / 15 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a sterile, clear, colourless solution filled into a 
15 mL clear, colourless glass vial with rubber stopper and flip-off aluminium seal.  
For intravenous administration, the 15 mL concentrate must be diluted in a 250 mL bag of citrate-buffered 
normal saline.  
The target fill volume of the solvent bags is 270 mL to ensure a minimum extractable volume of not less than 
250 mL over the proposed shelf life. The container closure system consists of a primary bag with two ports. 
One port is used for injection of lefamulin concentrate solution into the citrate buffer. The other port is used 
for infusion (administration) of the diluted finished product. The primary bag is covered by a secondary film 
overwrap.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. Both concentrate and solvent 
contain sodium containing excipients. This corresponds to 1,055 mg sodium per dose (with respect to 
nominal filling volume), which is adequately addressed in the SmPC in line with the Excipients Guideline, 
EMA/CHMP/302620/2017. 
Xenleta concentrate for solution for infusion 
The finished product (Xenleta concentrate 150 mg/15 mL) comprises a sterile, pyrogen-free solution of the 
active substance in 0.9 % sodium chloride solution. As the finished product is a concentrate for solution for 
infusion solubility of the active substance is the most critical physicochemical parameter. Lefamulin acetate is 
Assessment report

a BCS class III compound, highly soluble in water and 0.9% sodium chloride solution (> 300 mg/mL). Aside 
from the active substance, which is highly soluble in water, only NaCl, which is freely soluble in water, has to 
be dissolved. Precipitation at low temperatures is not to be expected. Nevertheless, a freeze-thaw cycle test 
has been performed and demonstrate that the product is not significantly affected by freezing. Specified pH-
value and osmolarity of the solution for dilution are well in the physiological range. Each component is 
considered safe in the proposed concentration.  
The manufacturing process of Xenleta Injection consists of compounding, bioburden reduction filtration, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling and visual inspection/packaging. Manufacturing of the bulk solution is a 
relatively simple process involving dissolution of lefamulin acetate and NaCl in water for injections. The 
mixing conditions have been evaluated during process validation studies and were considered to be 
acceptable. 
The manufacturing process remained consistent throughout development, the only differences were the 
increase in scale and related changes in equipment. An acceptable overview of the manufacturing process 
development was presented. The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and process validation 
data was provided. Samples of all batches manufactured during process transfer and up-scaling were put on 
formal stability studies to generate stability data under long term and accelerated conditions. 
To evaluate and select a suitable sterilisation method, a terminal sterilisation study by autoclaving and gamma-
irradiation was performed. The presented data demonstrated that the finished product is sensitive to elevated 
temperature and gamma-irradiation and that sterilisation at moist heat at standard conditions and sterilisation 
by  gamma-irradiation  are  not  an  option  due  an  increase  in  impurities.  Based  on  this  outcome  the  applicant 
concluded  that  Xenleta  Injection  should  be  manufactured  by  sterile  filtration  and  aseptic  processing.  The 
applicant’s justification was initially found to be incomplete as alternative autoclave temperatures had not been 
investigated,  and  a  major  objection  was  raised  on  this  point.  In  response,  the  applicant  carried  out  further 
investigation using F0-concept steam sterilisation. It was evident from the results presented that under these 
conditions,  significant  degradation  occurs  resulting  in  out  of  specification  results  for  three  degradation 
products.  In  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the  sterilisation  of  medicinal  product,  the  applicant  had 
demonstrated that a rationale stepwise approach to the development of the final method of manufacture has 
been thoroughly evaluated. Hence, the choice of the sterilisation process (sterile filtration followed by aseptic 
processing) is considered acceptable. 
The Xenleta Injection is supplied in 15 mL type I (Ph. Eur.) glass vials closed with chlorobutyl rubber stoppers 
and sealed with aluminium flip off crimps. The packaging material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. To demonstrate suitability of the primary packaging system the 
glass vials (testing of a different size is acceptable) have been tested for inorganic extractables and 
delamination. Based on the results provided both aspects can be considered as having negligible impact on 
quality. 
Furthermore, the coated chlorobutyl stoppers have been tested for extractables (at worst-case conditions) 
and leachables. As a result, from extractable studies a risk-based assessment of the identified extractables is 
presented. Although no extractables were detected in purified water, a leachable study was initiated on six 
potential extractable compounds observed in isopropyl acetate. Samples of one validation batch have been 
stored at long-term (refrigerated conditions) and accelerated conditions (25 ± 2°C / 60% ± 5% RH) up to 48

and 6 months. Leachable testing after storage at long-term conditions is on-going. However, leachable 
testing at accelerated conditions (25°C) are finished and test results at both storage conditions (up to 12 
months at refrigerated conditions) demonstrate that each tested leachable is below LOD. Therefore, further 
data on leachable studies was requested during the procedure. Sorption studies are not addressed, but 
results from stability studies demonstrate that this not an issue. Suitable tests have been performed to 
demonstrate integrity of the container closure system.  
Xenleta solvent for solution for infusion 
Extensive development work in formulation of the finished product (Xenleta solvent) was not necessary as 
the solvent is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution for infusion with common and stable excipients. It is used only 
for dilution of the respective concentrate of the active substance and provided as part of a kit together with 
the Xenleta concentrate. The excipients are very soluble or freely soluble in water. Therefore, precipitation at 
low temperatures is not to be expected and freeze-thaw cycle tests are not deemed necessary. No overages 
are employed in manufacture of the solvent solution. 
Specified pH-value and osmolarity of the solution are well in the physiological acceptable range. Each 
component, including buffer-capacity of the citrate-buffer, is considered safe in the proposed concentration. 
Detailed information on testing in clinical studies and compatibility with the active substance concentrate was 
presented. 
The manufacturing process of the bulk solution is a simple process involving dissolution of the excipients and 
the proposed manufacturer has a broad experience in manufacturing similar products. The bulk solution is 
filtered and filled into freeflex-bags. Finally, the filled bags are sterilised by moist heat. Detailed development 
studies on the manufacturing process of bulk solution and filling are not required. Manufacturing of the 
freeflex-bags is a standard process at the manufacturing site, however, due to the final sterilisation process 
(following F0 concept) the manufacturing process of the Xenleta solvent is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
The container closure system (two-port 250 mL infusion bag (freeflex)) is standard for this dosage form and 
commonly used for large parenteral preparations. The applicant has discussed suitability of the freeflex bags. 
It is stated that the freeflex bag is a bag system for parenteral solutions and is already approved for various 
infusion solutions like electrolytes, glucose, and colloids. The PVC-free overwrap is peelable and adheres 
slightly to the primary bag to improve handling. The overwrap effectively avoids solution losses through 
vaporing. It ensures that the primary bag is internally and externally sterile and can be displayed and used in 
a completely aseptic way. The packaging material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
In compliance with CPMP/QWP/4359/03 the freeflex bags have been product specific tested on leachables 
which may potentially occur. Based on the presented results the maximum daily exposure of each of the 
leachables/migrants is below the PDE. Based on the provided data from leachable testing it can be concluded 
that the freeflex bags are safe for use with citrate-buffered normal saline solution.  
Microbiological container integrity of the freeflex bag is tested on 100 mL bags. No growth was observed in 
the tested bags. It is certified that the 250 mL freeflex bags are produced with the same materials and

equipment as the 100 mL bag size, therefore the 100 mL bags are considered to be representative and the 
integrity test results were accepted.  
Compatibility of Xenleta Injection with the diluent, citrate-buffered normal saline, is evaluated in stability 
studies. Furthermore, to evaluate compatibility of the ready-to-use dilution with the infusion set, a study with 
a PVC and a PE- infusion set was performed and demonstrates compatibility up to the recommended infusion 
time of 1 hour. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Xenleta concentrate for solution for infusion 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: compounding, bioburden reduction filtration, sterilising 
filtration, filling, crimping and visual inspection / packaging. Due to the choice of sterilisation process (sterile 
filtration and aseptic filling) the process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. All steps 
are carried out at one manufacturing site. 
The  narrative  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  well  detailed.  The  critical  steps  in  the 
process are identified. The temperatures and times for steam sterilisation of stoppers and depyrogenation of 
vials  are  stated.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical  form.  Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  for  three  consecutive 
batches of full commercial scale. The batches have been manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site 
by the commercial manufacturing process. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Based on the bioburden results collected during validation of manufacturing process and on results of media 
fill qualification, holding times are established.  
Xenleta solvent for solution for infusion 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  solvent  consists  of  five  main  steps:  compounding  /  preparation  of  bulk 
solution, bacterial retention filtration, filling & pouching, final sterilisation and packaging. Due to the choice of 
sterilisation process (steam sterilisation following F0-concept) the process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. All steps are carried out at one manufacturing site. 
The narrative description of the manufacturing process is sufficiently well detailed. The critical steps in 
manufacturing of the finished product are identified. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been 
validated for three consecutive batches using different tank sizes covering the proposed commercial batch 
size range. The range of batch volume should ensure the flexibility within the available tanks suitable for 
commercial manufacture. These batches have been manufactured with the “new” freeflex -film (with non-
phthalates containing catalyst). It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
The proposed maximum holding time for the bulk solution from begin of mixing to start of the sterilisation 
process has been evaluated during process validation and is accepted.

solution and the nature of the ingredients, no impurities or degradation products are expected from this 
formulation. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using 
a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it

risk assessment and evaluation of the risk regarding potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product. No risk of nitrosamines is determined. 
The batch analyses data for 6 batches (including four commercial scale validation batches (2 at minimum, 1 
at intermediate and 1 at maximum commercial scale) are presented confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Xenleta concentrate for solution for infusion 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) and under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for 6 months at advanced 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Xenleta 
concentrate are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
Additionally,  three  further  clinical  batches  (smaller  scale)  have  been  put  on  stability  studies.  These  batches 
have been also manufactured in compliance with the commercial process, however, instead of stainless-steel 
tanks disposable bags have been used in manufacturing. 
Samples  were  tested  in  line  with  the  shelf  life  specifications.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability 
indicating.  
Results demonstrate that the product appears at long term (refrigerated) conditions to be chemically and 
physically stable. The data obtained show no noticeable degradation up to 36 months and all parameters 
remain within the acceptance criteria over the assessed period. No trends are observed. 
Results  at  accelerated  conditions  show  signs  of  degradation  but  meet  the  acceptance  criteria  over  the 
investigated period up to 36 months. All results are within specified limits of the shelf-life specification. 
Results at advanced accelerated storage show a significant increase in degradation products which lead to 
OOS results after 3 months in three stability batches. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. Based on the obtained results the product is not sensitive to light.

According  to  the  product  SmPC,  15  mL  of  lefamulin  concentrate  must  be  mixed  into  the  bag  of  solvent 
containing 250 mL solution of citrate buffered saline and administered by infusion over a period of 60 minutes. 
Therefore, in-use stability of the ready-for-infusion dilution has been tested at refrigerated and (uncontrolled) 
room conditions. Based on the data presented, all tested dilution batches (also the batch at end of shelf-life) 
remain physically and chemically stable at refrigerated as well as at room temperature up to 7 days storage 
time. No trend can be observed. Furthermore, in a microbial challenge study it is demonstrated that accidental 
contamination  of  lefamulin  infusion  bags  (after  dilution)  does  not  lead  to  growth  of  challenge  organisms 
including bacteria, yeasts and moulds for up to 98 hours. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with the storage instructions “Store in 
a refrigerator (2 to 8°C). Do not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.  
The chemical and physical in-use stability following dilution has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at 
room temperature and up to 48 hours at 2 to 8°C as stated in the SmPC. 
Xenleta solvent for solution for infusion 
Stability data from six production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (5 ± 3°C / ambient RH), 48 months under alternative long-term conditions (25ºC / 40% RH), 12 
months under intermediate conditions (30°C/35% RH) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 25% 
RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Xenleta  solvent  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  in  line  with  the  shelf  life  specifications.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability 
indicating.  
The obtained results, concerning the specified physical, chemical and microbiological properties demonstrate 
that  the  product  is  stable  during  the  investigated  time  periods.  The  medicinal  product  remains  within  the 
acceptance  criteria.  Except  for  loss  of  water  (max.  4.5%  after  48  storage  time  at  long-term  conditions 
25°C/40% RH and max. 3.4 % after 6 months storage time at accelerated conditions), no significant change 
in any of the parameters tested can be observed. Due to the set point in IPC for target fill volume of the bags, 
it is assured that the extractable volume of not less than 250 mL is maintained throughout the shelf life with 
water loss of NMT 5 %. 
In addition, the applicant has submitted photostability data confirming that the diluent is not sensitive to 
light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with the storage instructions “Store 
below 25°C. Do not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.  
It should be noted that according to the Guideline on declaration of storage conditions in the product 
information of medicinal products, based on the data provided, no temperature labelling statement is 
required. However, as the diluent will be marketed as a kit together with the concentrate, a storage 
statement with respect to temperature should be applied.

Adventitious agents 
Non-Viral Adventitious Agents 
Lefamulin acetate is a semi-synthetic molecule. Pleuromutilin, the key intermediate and first starting material 
for chemical synthesis in the lefamulin acetate active substance manufacture, is derived from the fungus 
Clitopilus scyphoides var intermedius by fermentation Confirmation that there is no risk associated with 
adventitious agent contamination of this material is provided via TSE certification by the pleuromutilin 
manufacturer. 
Viral Adventitious Agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used in the manufacture of active substance or 
finished product. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Lefamulin is an antibacterial agent of the pleuromutilin class that is presented for intravenous (IV) and oral 
(PO) use to treat adults with CAP. 
Lefamulin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting with the A- and P- sites of the peptidyl 
transferase centre (PTC) in the central part of domain V of the 23s rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, 
preventing correct positioning of the tRNA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 29/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The non-clinical pharmacological aspects of lefamulin were assessed in the Clinical AR. The spectrum of 
antibacterial activity of lefamulin supports selection of CAP as a target indication. 
No non-clinical secondary pharmacodynamics studies were submitted. The potential for target effects of 
lefamulin on common secondary targets including receptors, enzymes and ion channels were neither provided 
nor discussed. The applicant states that secondary pharmacodynamics is not applicable to lefamulin because 
no pharmacological effects other than the primary therapeutic activity (antimicrobial) are known. However, it 
is clear from the safety pharmacology studies and toxicology studies described that lefamulin does have 
pharmacological effects beyond those of inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. However, the carrying out of a 
secondary screen may not give any additional information at this point, as toxicities are known due to in vivo 
work, and there is adequate clinical experience (n=1242) where safety findings of interest mirror findings in 
the non-clinical toxicology studies, namely administration site reactions, GI events and QT/QTc prolongation. 
Effects on eukaryotic ribosomal translation were described in the clinical module, mammalian and 
mitochondrial protein synthesis are unaffected by lefamulin. 
The IC50 for lefamulin at the hERG channel is 27 µM in CHO cells and 47 µM in HEK-293 cells. In rabbit 
Purkinje fibres, the potential to prolong the duration of the action potential was observed. Lefamulin showed 
a potential for QT/QTc interval prolongation, while displaying a pro-arrhythmic potential at 10 µg/ml, but not 
at 0.5 µg/ml and 3 µg/ml. In vitro, the hERG IC50 for the metabolite BC-8041 was approximately ≥10-fold 
higher than the IC50 recorded for lefamulin in CHO cells. 
In telemetered monkeys (study SNBL.289.02), dose-dependent QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed. 
The duration of prolongation noted at 40 mg/kg (highest dose tested) was 31 and 37 msec above baseline for 
QT and QTcF, respectively. The control-adjusted mean maximal QT and QTcF interval prolongation was 33 
and 40 ms, respectively. Dosing at 15 mg/kg (NOAEL) caused a QTcF interval prolongation of 21 ms, 
however under conditions of this study QTc prolongation in excess of 25 – 30 ms (about 10%) is adverse. 
The discrepancies in concentrations at which changes were observed in these studies may be due to different 
endpoints, test systems, and technologies, however a specific reason for the discrepancies could not be 
identified by the applicant. Nonetheless the non-clinical studies/assays indicated a risk of QT prolongation, 
and it is clinically relevant, however the applicant considers it not to be a significant risk with appropriate 
precautions and use. 
In study SNBL.289.02 the applicant presents tabulated data (from study 36074 PAP. However, TK data were 
generated in study SNBL.289.02 and are described in the study report (). The extrapolated Ceoi values 
derived in study SNBL.289.02 are approximately half that of the Cmax measured in the non-GLP study. These 
values, from study 36074 PAP, were used to derive safety margins for cardiovascular and respiratory safety 
pharmacology. However, the use of the values obtained in study 36074 generate a more conservative safety 
margin than the extrapolated values in study SNBL.289.02.  
There were no adverse effects of lefamulin on nervous system function (as assessed by evaluation of Irwin 
parameters) and no adverse effects on respiratory function.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In order to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of lefamulin several PPE, LC-MS/MS methods were 
developed and validated as appropriate for plasma from rats and monkeys. The methods were of sufficient 
sensitivity and specificity and considered adequate to support the performed toxicokinetics analysis with a 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 50 ng/ml in rat plasma and in cynomolgus monkey the LLOQ is 50 
ng/ml (Method SNBL.289.05) or 1 ng/ml (Method A&M 11-011).  
Based on the data derived from the IV and oral routes of administration, a dose-proportional systemic 
exposure of lefamulin was demonstrated in all species tested. Following a single IV administration of 
lefamulin the plasma concentration time curve is described by a multi-phasic decline, with a rapid initial 
distribution phase followed by a terminal elimination phase with half-life values of 2.1-2.5 h in rats and 6.5-
7.4 h in monkeys, extending to 8.6-11.8 h in humans. 
Pharmacokinetics following repeat dose administration was measured as part of toxicokinetics.  
No clear differences between male and female animals were seen in ADME studies. Moderate in-vitro plasma 
protein binding of 73-88% in humans and 61-81% in animals was observed. 
Lefamulin displayed low binding affinity to the two major drug binding human plasma proteins (human serum 
albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein). In-vitro antimicrobial activity is maintained in the presence of human 
or mouse serum. A quantitative whole-body autoradiography in rats after IV bolus administration showed a 
rapid distribution into tissues and organs consistent with the apparent low protein binding affinity observed in 
vitro. The levels of radioactivity measured in the majority of the tissues including skin, soft tissues and lungs 
were higher than the radioactivity measured in the circulating blood. Similar distribution was observed after 
oral dosing of 14C-lefamulin. Tissue distribution in pregnant rats following IV administration showed limited 
transfer of radiolabelled lefamulin to the foetus, with no evidence of retention or accumulation in any foetal 
tissues. In lactating dams, excretion of lefamulin into maternal milk was shown, indicating an exposure to 
suckling pups. 
The metabolite profile of lefamulin generated with primary human hepatocytes displayed mainly hydroxylated 
metabolites (phase I). With cynomolgus monkey, rabbit, rat and mouse hepatocytes, similar metabolite 
profiles were observed. In monkey, rabbit and mouse, a mono-hydroxy lefamulin glucuronide (phase II) was 
also observed. No unique human metabolites were identified.  
The major human lefamulin metabolite, BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy-lefamulin), is present in rat and monkey, the 
species used in the pivotal toxicology studies. Based on the in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies, plasma 
levels of major human metabolite BC-8041 in animals has been evaluated and its safety profile further 
assessed in an in vitro IKr (hERG) assay, Ames and Mouse Lymphoma Assay genotoxicity tests, and embryo-
foetal development studies in rats. However, low levels of metabolite were detected in rat samples following 
a single administration of 37.5 mg/kg IV or 150 mg/kg oral dose of 14C-lefamulin (study 1281-043 and study 
BC3-TX-01).  
In line with ICH M3 (R2) the applicant conducted a comprehensive range of testing in order to fully 
characterise the parent and the major human metabolite BC-8041. It is acknowledged that relative to human 
exposure the exposure levels of this metabolite in rats and rabbits was low. However, the characterisation of 
the metabolite is considered adequate in the monkey (where it has been demonstrated that the animal was 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 31/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sufficiently exposed). Furthermore, studies conducted with a synthesised version of this specific metabolite in 
the rat should generally compensate for the sub-clinical exposure levels attained in this species – in line with 
published guidance. Considering the short duration of treatment, accepted metabolite characterisation in the 
NHP, and the specific studies with synthesised metabolite, the metabolite can be considered adequately 
characterised. 
Lefamulin is predominantly eliminated via the non-renal route. Recovery of radioactivity in faeces suggests 
excretion via the bile and/or the gut mucosa. The faecal route is the principal route of elimination for this 
compound, as confirmed by mass balance studies in rats and monkeys. 
CYP3A4 and 3A5 were identified as lefamulin metabolising enzymes using isolated recombinant CYP450 
isoenzymes as well as human liver microsomes and chemical inhibitors. For enzyme induction studies, the 
applicant used 3-10 times the Cmax (5 µM) up to 50 µM. The guidance stipulates that 50-fold the mean 
unbound Cmax should be tested, which coincidentally is also ~50 µM. Treatment of cultured human 
hepatocytes with up to 15 μM lefamulin caused no toxicity whereas > 50 µM caused concentration-dependent 
cytotoxicity. 
No induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 was detected in human hepatocytes. Since lefamulin did not 
induce CYP3A4 it is also not expected to induce P-gp. However, lefamulin is both a P-gp substrate and an 
inhibitor. Since lefamulin saturated its own efflux in Caco-2 cells, it may have the potential to saturate P-gp 
mediated efflux in a clinical setting as well. Lefamulin is not a substrate of efflux transporters BCRP, BSEP, 
MATE1, MATE2-K, or uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but is a substrate of the uptake transporter 
OCT1 and, as already mentioned above, the efflux transporter P-gp. Lefamulin as substrate was not 
evaluated for the transporters OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3 since lefamulin is eliminated renally to an extent below 
25%. Inhibition potential was shown with BSEP, BCRP, OCT1 and MATE1 while very poor inhibition was seen 
with the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. With regard to the renal uptake transporters, 
no inhibition potential was seen with OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and MATE2-K. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions, especially with CYP3A, should be accounted for in the SmPC. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Three single dose toxicity studies in rodents (mice and rats) were presented. Two were not conducted in 
compliance with GLP, and had shorter than ideal observation periods post dosing (7-day evaluation in first 
study, 1 day in second study). The third study, NAB011, was conducted in compliance with GLP and had 14 
days of observation. Lefamulin was not well tolerated at higher doses with death and moribundity common 
occurrences. Much higher doses are tolerated by the oral route than by the IV route. 
There are discrepancies in adverse events described in rat following single dose oral administration, including 
the MTD in two studies. In study Nabriva 2008-31 PKB, the MTD is 1500 mg/kg, while in NAB011 the MTD is 
5 times lower at 300 mg/kg. In study NAB011, lefamulin was tested up to 900 mg/kg (n=10, 5/sex/group), 
compared to study Nabriva 2008-31 PKB where lefamulin was only tested at two concentrations 1500 mg/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 32/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(n=2) and 2000 mg/kg (n=3). The differences in the studies can be accepted to explain the differences in 
MTD observed in the two studies.  
Justification for carrying out study NABRIVA-2018-02 TOX was requested, as in 2010 the CHMP removed the 
guideline on single dose toxicity, based upon the reasoning that single dose studies are of limited value and 
that information on acute toxicity can be obtained in other types of toxicology studies, and removing the 
need for these studies is in line with the 3Rs principals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). This study was 
carried out in 2015, years after the previous single dose studies and around the time of the repeat dose 
toxicity study AB21052, which used the same vehicle, route of administration and similar doses. The 
applicant states that the study was carried out to comply with a request from the FDA to evaluate higher 
doses, and is viewed by the applicant as a dose range finding study carried out prior to the repeat dose study 
AB21052. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat dose studies in both rats and monkeys, local intolerance was dose limiting by both oral and IV 
routes of administration. Diarrhoea and poor physical condition were noted in both rats and monkeys, which 
was accompanied by body weight loss, emesis in monkeys and in rats, marked distension of the small and 
large intestine (mostly affecting the caecum), including meteorism (bloating). The intestinal dilatation in rats 
is considered to be a rodent-specific effect in response to dosing with antibiotics. Dilatation is attributed to 
local antibacterial effects on the intestinal flora rather than a direct effect on the GI tract (Courtney, 2000).  
With IV administration, tolerability was limited by local reactions at the administration site in both rats and 
monkeys. Animals were typically dosed twice daily with 12 hours between dose administrations. In studies of 
up to 13 weeks in duration, abscesses, thrombi and inflammatory changes were noted at the injection site 
and thrombosis and embolisms, with related inflammatory changes and necrosis, were observed in visceral 
organs. These effects were dose limiting, necessitated dose reductions/drug holidays, and were associated 
with morbidity, premature terminations, or mortality in both species. Some effects persisted 4 weeks after 
cessation of dosing. 
In rats, local intolerance was not observed with a formulation containing 1.875 mg/mL lefamulin dissolved in 
10 mM citrate-buffered saline when injected every 12 hours for 13 weeks. In a 13-week repeated dose 
toxicity study in monkeys, a formulation containing 6.67 mg/mL lefamulin dissolved in 10 mM citrate-
buffered saline was tolerated for approximately 6 weeks but thereafter a decline in clinical condition 
secondary to local intolerance was noted. For comparison, the clinical formulation contains approximately 0.6 
mg/mL lefamulin in the same vehicle. Evidence of dose-dependent regenerative anaemia in both species 
indicated lefamulin was potentially haemolytic. This effect was not apparent from in-vitro evaluation of blood 
compatibility using human blood. The in-vitro test was performed at a lower concentration (0.6 mg/mL) than 
the concentrations in formulations used for animal studies. 
No systemic target organ was identified in studies up to 13 weeks of administration. Dose limiting toxicities 
affected the exposure levels achieved. The highest systemic exposure without local signs of toxicity was 
achieved in a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The steady-state exposure level 
at the NOAEL of 120 mg/kg/day was 79.7 µg·h/mL for AUC0-24 and 15.8 µg/mL for Cmax, 2.8 and 2.4 times 
the mean AUC of the clinical IV or oral dose, respectively. The IV therapeutic daily dose of lefamulin is 300

mg (150 mg q12h). Arithmetic mean therapeutic exposure at steady-state in CAP patients for the 150 mg 
q12h IV dose was 28.4 µg·h/mL (AUC0-24) with a corresponding Cmax of 3.03 µg/mL. The oral daily dose is 
1200 mg (600 mg q12h). Arithmetic mean therapeutic exposure at steady-state in CAP patients for the 600 
mg q12h oral dose was 32.7 µg·h/mL (AUC0-24) with a corresponding Cmax of 2.24 µg/mL. 
Genotoxicity 
Lefamulin did not exhibit genotoxic potential in a battery of standard genotoxicity assays. Cytotoxicity limited 
the concentrations that were used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of lefamulin in the Ames reverse 
mutation study. In an in-vivo micronucleus test in rats (≤100 mg/kg/day), there was no evidence of 
chromosomal damage with lefamulin (AUC0-8 ≤ 26.9 µg.h/mL). Exposure margins of 2.5-5 can be calculated 
comparing exposure in rats to human lefamulin exposure. Overall, there are no data to suggest a potential 
for genotoxicity with lefamulin.  
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not carried out by the applicant. In line with guidance, carcinogenicity studies 
are not required if expected clinical use is for a short duration. Lefamulin did not produce effects indicative of 
genotoxic potential either in vitro or in vivo, or in toxicology studies of up to 13 weeks in duration. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility, embryo-foetal development, pre- and post-natal development and juvenile toxicity studies were 
conducted in rats, and embryo-foetal development has been assessed in rabbits. In addition, the effects on 
rat embryo-foetal development of the metabolite BC-8041 have been assessed. 
Effects on embryo-foetal development were evaluated in rats and rabbits. Overall, a reduced live pup birth 
index in rats indicated an effect of lefamulin on embryo-foetal survival at high doses (AUC0-24 = 24.4 μg·h/mL 
at 100 mg/kg/day). In the rat EFD study, there were 1 (1), 2 (2) and 2 (2) malformed foetuses (litters) in 
the control, 2 x 37.5 and 2 x 50 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. However, it was concluded that due to the 
lack of any increase in other less severe skeletal anomalies or variations affecting the mandible, palate or 
vertebrae, in the treated groups compared with the control, and the fact that these abnormalities were 
spontaneous in origin, they were not considered treatment-related. However, there was clearly an increased 
incidence in malformations versus the historical control groups. Increased incidence of retarded ossification in 
all treatment groups versus controls is also reported in the rat EFD study. Furthermore, in the rabbit EFD 
study the suspected adverse effects of cannulation may have compromised the validity of the study (high 
incidence of control group mortality), and there was increased incidence of maternal toxicity and subsequent 
EFD effects that could be species-specific; but a relationship to treatment remains equivocal. Taken together 
the association of adverse EFD with treatment remains equivocal.  
The applicant has provided a comprehensive review of the EFD findings in relation to historical controls and 
updated the SPC accordingly. The non-clinical expert discussed the historical control data sets and the 
incidence levels. Incidences of malformed foetuses was concluded to be 0.3% (4/1232), and the nature of 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020

the malformations in one high-dose animal may be a procedural artefact. Moreover, the rate and nature of 
the incidences in line with historical control data sets. Further, the applicant explains that no dose-response 
can be assigned to the malformations reported. In summary, it is concluded that the weight-of-evidence 
suggests that reported EFD malformations were spontaneous in origin and any association with treatment 
could be considered unlikely. Consequently, the applicant proposes an update to the SPC, which is accepted, 
as it provides further clarity into the nature of the findings from the developmental toxicology programme. 
Further reassurance is given by the updated wording in section 4.6 of the SPC: Xenleta is not recommended 
during pregnancy, and the pregnancy pharmacovigilance programme. 
In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, (AB21312), the pup live birth index was markedly lower at the 
highest dose tested only (100 mg/kg/day), (with 33 stillborn/dead pups on PND 0 compared with 4 in the 
control), associated with partial or total litter death of 4/25 litters. At a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, the live birth 
index was 87.4 % in high-dose groups v 98.7 % in the control. It is assumed that the exposure levels were 
less than that reported in the clinic at the proposed NOAEL of 75 mg/kg/day. The applicant was asked to 
discuss and a NOAEL of 75 mg/kg/day was agreed, however the mechanism behind the increased incidence 
of stillbirths in animals is unknown. 
The applicant proposes to update section 4.6 of the SPC to specifically reflect the findings from the Pre- and 
Post-natal; development study (AB21312). The text proposed is now a more accurate reflection of the data. 
Unknown mechanisms relating to increase in still births in animals cannot ruled out clinically, therefore the 
following wording is accepted: 
There are no data from the use of lefamulin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown increased 
incidence of stillbirth (see section 5.3). Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal 
development (see section 5.3). 
Xenleta is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Juvenile toxicity 
In the juvenile toxicity studies adverse effects can be attributed to exacerbated pharmacological effects. 
There were no adverse effects on juvenile rat growth, development or maturation of the organ systems 
evaluated, including CNS assessments and reproductive function. 
Following IV administration there were local tolerance effects at all doses. There was clear evidence of a dose 
response. In rats, these inflammatory changes occurred primarily in mid- and high-dose groups in which 
lefamulin was infused at concentrations of 1.67 and 2.5 mg/mL (the concentration for the low dose group 
was 0.83 mg/mL). As with rats, the findings in monkeys suggest lefamulin-associated exacerbation of injuries 
caused by the presence of the indwelling catheter. In EFD studies the placement of the catheter caused 
mortality in rabbits.

Other toxicity studies 
Local intolerance was not observed with a formulation containing 1.875 mg/mL lefamulin in 10mM citrate-
buffered saline.  
In vitro haemolysis did not occur when lefamulin was tested at 0.6 mg/mL (the proposed clinical 
administration dose). Haemolysis was noted in toxicology studies, when lefamulin was dosed at 
concentrations greater the 0.6 mg/mL. In single dose studies in rats lefamulin at 15 mg/mL, red coloured 
urine was observed in surviving animals, suggesting the occurrence of item-related haemolysis. In repeat 
dose toxicity studies, haemolysis was also induced by test item concentrations 2.5 to 7.5 mg/mL in the 
administered solutions at the infusion site. Specifically, in the 91-day monkey study (SNBL.289.19), 
haemolysis was accompanied by evidence of a reactive response in the bone marrow resulting in the release 
of larger, immature erythrocytes. The clinical significance of this finding is not adequately discussed, and a 
clinical safety margin was not established. In the absence of a human safety margin for this finding, the 
applicant was asked to discuss the potential risk to humans and potential mechanism of action, and to 
discuss if concentrations greater than 0.6 mg/mL were tested for the occurrence of haemolysis. 
In response to the request, the applicant provided a study report, Nabriva 2019-15 MIB (dated December 
2019), where they tested concentrations greater than 0.6 mg/ml and up to 8 mg/ml. Overall, lefamulin was 
compatible with human red blood cells up to concentration of 2 mg/mL. 
Lefamulin does not absorb UVA, UVB or visible (290-700 nm) light and has a molar extinction coefficient < 30 
Lmol-1cm-1. Therefore, phototoxicity studies were not performed. ICH S10 states that a molar extinction 
coefficient <1000 Lmol-1cm-1 is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct 
phototoxicity, therefore, the lack of further phototoxicity studies is acceptable. 
Metabolites 
Analysis of metabolites following oral dosing in human showed one mono-hydroxylated metabolite (BC-8041) 
with exposure greater than 10% of parent drug systemic exposure level at steady-state. In monkeys dosed 
orally for 28 days, BC-8041 represented approximately 22% of lefamulin exposure at the NOAEL of 70 
mg/kg/day (i.e. AUC0-12 = 0.924 μg·h/mL BC-8041). When dosed twice-daily IV for 28 days, BC-8041 levels 
were 7.9% of lefamulin exposure at the NOAEL of 120 mg/kg/day (i.e. AUC0-12 = 3.13 μg·h/mL). In addition 
to characterising levels of BC-8041 present in animals dosed with lefamulin, standalone studies were 
conducted to further assess the non-clinical safety profile of BC-8041. 
BC-8041 did not demonstrate a potential for QT/QTc interval prolongation (hERG IC50 of 702.18 μM) and 
exhibited no teratogenicity in a rat embryo-foetal development toxicity study. In this latter study the daily 
doses of 2 x 20 mg/kg (40 mg/kg/day) exceeded BC-8041 mean steady state maximum exposures in human 
by more than 2-fold after oral administration of therapeutic doses of lefamulin. 
Impurities 
According to ICH Q3A, the qualification threshold for impurities in a drug substance is 0.15% or 1 mg/day, 
whichever is lower. For the 1200 mg/day oral dose, 0.15% is 1.8 mg, therefore the lower value of 1 mg/day 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 36/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(0.08%) should be applicable. However, the guideline does make provisions for the use of higher thresholds 
taking into account the use and exposure of the drug substance/product. Considering the duration of 
treatment of lefamulin acetate an identification and qualification threshold of 0.15% can be accepted (See 
Quality AR). The applicant suggests that known impurities BC-3846 and BC-3826, which have been qualified 
in toxicity studies with the non-GMP batches (study C06271 and study SNBL.289.03), were set to the lowest 
level present in either batch. This resulted in a proposed specification of ≤ 0.20 % for BC-3846 and ≤ 0.30 % 
for BC-3826. However, study C06271 could not establish a NOAEL due to adverse test item related findings, 
and is therefore not accepted in support of impurity qualification. Study SNBL.289.03, a 14-day study in 
cynomolgus monkeys, established a NOAEL of 80 mg/kg/day. Batch data for the non-clinical batch (study 
SNBL.289.03) have not been provided in support of the proposed limits of impurities. Batch analysis data was 
therefore requested from the applicant in support of the proposed limits. 
Batch data was provided by the applicant from the 14-day study in rats (C06271) and from the 14-day study 
in monkeys (SNBL.289.03). 
In the rat study (study no. C06271) the derived TDI (60 kg subject) of 1.5 mg and 2.9 mg for BC-3846 and 
BC-3826, respectively, exceeds the calculated maximum TDI for IV administration (0.6 mg and 0.9 mg, 
respectively), but is slightly below the calculated maximum TDI for oral administration (2.4 mg and 3.6 mg, 
respectively). This study could not establish a NOAEL. The batch used in this study was also used in 
genotoxicity studies, and was nongenotoxic.  
The monkey study (SNBL.289.03) established a NOAEL of 80 mg/kg/day, with impurity levels for BC-3846 of 
0.65%, and BC-3826 of 0.30%. Calculating the derived TDI (60 kg subject) of 10.1 mg and 4.6 mg for BC-
3846 and BC-3826, respectively, exceeds the calculated maximum TDI for both IV administration (0.6 mg 
and 0.9 mg, respectively) and oral administration (2.4 mg and 3.6 mg, respectively). 
Based on this study the impurities can be considered qualified, at the proposed limits.

In calculating the PECsw the applicant refined the Fpen using prevalence data and treatment regime. 
According to the Q&A document by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) a 
Fpen-refinement is only acceptable if it is based on published prevalence data and/or treatment regime. The

environment. The applicant commits to complete Phase II of the Environmental Risk Assessment and provide 
the updated ERA including all study reports.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The non-clinical pharmacological aspects of lefamulin were assessed in the Clinical AR. The spectrum of 
antibacterial activity of lefamulin supports selection of CAP as a target indication. 
No non-clinical secondary pharmacodynamics studies were submitted. The applicant states that secondary 
pharmacodynamics is not applicable to lefamulin because no pharmacological effects other than the primary 
therapeutic activity (antimicrobial) are known. However, it is clear from the safety pharmacology studies and 
toxicology studies described that lefamulin does have pharmacological effects beyond those of inhibiting 
bacterial protein synthesis. However, the carrying out of a secondary screen may not give any additional 
information at this point, as toxicities are known due to in vivo work, and there is adequate clinical 
experience (n=1242) where safety findings of interest mirror findings in the non-clinical toxicology studies, 
namely administration site reactions, GI events and QT/QTc prolongation. Effects on eukaryotic ribosomal 
translation were described in the clinical module, mammalian and mitochondrial protein synthesis are 
unaffected by lefamulin. The safety pharmacology studies in rats, rabbits and monkeys showed potential for 
QT/QTc prolongation, which correlate to a clinical risk, which according to the applicant is not a clinically 
significant risk with appropriate precautions and use. The CHMP considered that the provided non-clinical 
pharmacology package is supportive of the MAA. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics package is acceptable. Based on the data derived from the IV and oral route of 
administration a dose-proportional systemic exposure of lefamulin was demonstrated in all species tested. 
Lefamulin displayed low binding affinity to the two major drug binding human plasma proteins (human serum 
albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein) and in-vitro antimicrobial activity is maintained in the presence of 
human or mouse serum. No unique human metabolites were identified. The major human lefamulin 
metabolite, BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy-lefamulin), is present in rat and monkey, the species used in the pivotal 
toxicology studies. The faecal route is the principal route of elimination confirmed by mass balance studies in 
rats and monkeys. Lefamulin was identified as a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, P-gp and OCT1. CYP3A4 and 
3A5 were identified as lefamulin metabolising enzymes. The potential for drug-drug interactions is accounted 
for in the SmPC. 
Toxicology 
The safety studies are in line with ICH M3(R2) guidance. In repeat dose studies in both rats and monkeys, 
local intolerance was dose limiting by both oral and IV routes of administration. Following oral administration, 
diarrhoea and poor physical condition were noted in both rats and monkeys which was accompanied by body 
weight loss, emesis in monkeys, and in rats, marked distension of the small and large intestine. With IV 
administration, tolerability was limited by local reactions at the administration site in both rats and monkeys. 
No systemic target organ was identified in studies up to 13 weeks of administration. Dose limiting toxicities 
affected the exposure levels achieved. The highest systemic exposure without local signs of toxicity was 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 39/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
achieved in a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, where 2.8 and 2.4 times the 
mean AUC of the clinical IV or oral dose was achieved, respectively. 
Lefamulin is not genotoxic. No carcinogenicity studies have been carried out, as the expected clinical use is of 
short duration.  
Effects on embryo-foetal development were evaluated in rats and rabbits. Overall, a reduced live pup birth 
index in rats indicated an effect of lefamulin on embryo-foetal survival at high doses (AUC0-24 = 24.4 μg·h/mL 
at 100 mg/kg/day). Foetal skeletal malformations were noted in the rat embryo-foetal development study in 
both control and treated animals. Unknown mechanisms relating to the increase in still births in animals 
cannot ruled out clinically, and this is reflected in Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. In juvenile animals 
lefamulin had no adverse effects on the juvenile rats’ growth, development, and the maturation of the organ 
systems evaluated, including CNS assessments and reproductive function. The CHMP considered that the 
provided non-clinical toxicology package is supportive of the MAA. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered the non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology programmes to be 
sufficient to support the MAA for lefamulin. 
Until the results of the Phase II assessment are complete, no final conclusions on the environmental risk 
assessment is currently possible and the CHMP considers the following measure to be necessary to address 
the non-clinical issues: 
The applicant commits to complete Phase II of the Environmental Risk Assessment and provide the updated 
ERA including all study reports. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Three sites in study 3102 (one in each of Peru, Hungary and Poland) were closed to enrolment early by the 
applicant following internal audits that identified some GCP compliance issues.  
The Rapporteur was notified in early September of two inspections of the individual sites in Hungary and 
Poland that were conducted by the National Regulatory Authorities. The findings of these inspections are not 
considered likely to impact on the overall validity of the data.  
Furthermore, the Rapporteur was notified in early September that the Austrian NRA had conducted an 
inspection of Nabriva and that the conclusions were satisfactory.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Lefamulin (as acetate) for intravenous use is presented in vials containing 10 mg/ml, equivalent to 150 mg of 
lefamulin in 15 ml of normal saline. The content of each vial is diluted to a final concentration of 0.6 mg/ml 
using 250 ml of 10mM citrate buffered normal saline. Lefamulin (as acetate) for oral use is presented as 
immediate release (IR) coated tablets containing 600 mg lefamulin free base. The only differences between 
Phase 3 and commercial tablets is in their appearance. 
Absorption  
Intravenous formulation studies 
Study 1001 was the FIH study for lefamulin in which fasted male subjects received single IV doses from 25 
mg to 400 mg in 200 mL normal saline or placebo. The 25 mg and 50 mg doses were infused over 30 min

and the higher doses over 60 min. The 300 and 400 mg doses were associated with local intolerance. AUC0-∞ 
increased dose-proportionally over the 25 to 400 mg range. 
In study 1002 male subjects received 75 mg BID or 150 mg BID using 1h or 2h infusions. There was a 1.4-
fold increase in AUC0-12 after repeat vs. single dosing irrespective of the dose or duration of the infusion while 
mean Cmax demonstrated a 1.14- to 1.15-fold increase after repeat dosing. Based on plasma trough levels, 
steady state was achieved after ~2 days.

Due to early observations of poor tolerance of IV infusions, two studies (1007 and 1009) were conducted to 
investigate the use of buffered solutions.  
In study 1007 dosing with 150 mg or 200 mg lefamulin in 400 mL 10 mM citrate buffered saline q12h for 5 
days using 1-h infusions slightly improved local tolerance vs. using only saline as the diluent. In study 1009, 
150 mg lefamulin was given q12h for 15 doses (7.5 days) using 1h infusions in saline or 10mM citrate 
buffered saline (pH5). The PK parameters for lefamulin were not affected by the diluent used. As in 1002, 
lefamulin exposures were higher after repeat dose administration (1.4-fold for AUC0-12 on day 8 vs. day 1 for 
both treatments). 
Oral formulation studies 
In study 1101 single oral doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg lefamulin using capsules were given in the fasted 
state. The mean AUC0-∞ increased with dose but the dose-normalised AUC0-∞ was lower after 100 mg (6.97 
ng·h/ml/mg) and similar after 200 to 400 mg (16.05 ng·h/ml/mg after 200 mg and 16.62 ng·h/ml/mg after 
400 mg). In 1102, in which lefamulin was given at 200, 400 or 600 mg BID for 9 days in the fasted state, 
there was a bimodal plasma peak with the first at 20 minutes to 1 h after dosing and a second at 1-4 h. 
Steady state was reached after ~2 days.

In 2 studies of site of absorption (BC3-PK-01 and 02) plasma lefamulin exposure was greater when the dose 
was delivered via an Enterion capsule to the distal small bowel but was lower after delivery to the colon when 
compared to the IR capsule formulation. Direct delivery of the lipidic formulation via Enterion capsule to the 
PSB had no real effect of enhancement on the systemic bioavailability. It was concluded that there was no 
significant improvement in absorption when bypassing the stomach.  
Lefamulin is a substrate for P-gp and could theoretically saturate its own efflux. The applicant proposed that 
the reduced AUC of the MR formulations may reflect increased P-gp efflux into the intestinal lumen due to 
lower luminal concentrations and thus less saturation of P-gp. In contrast, absorption from the IR formulation 
was rapid with a potential saturable efflux and hence possible higher availability. Following dosing of the MR 
formulations a few subjects had Tmax values suggesting an IR burst, which was proposed to be possibly due 
to increased release in acidic conditions and/or formulation breakdown. It was decided not to proceed with 
MR formulations.  
Absolute bioavailability  
Study 1107 investigated the absolute bioavailability of oral lefamulin from the 600 mg IR tablet and 
bioequivalence between the 200 mg hard gelatine capsules (used in some prior Phase 1 studies) and the 600 
mg IR tablet in the fasted state. The study also evaluated the effect of food on absolute bioavailability from 
the 600 mg tablet. The plasma profiles tended to exhibit 2 peaks, the first between 20 min and 1 or 2 h and 
the second between 1 to 5 h post-dose.  
After dosing with one 600 mg tablet (A) or 3 x 200 mg capsules (B) in the fasted state bioequivalence was 
demonstrated (see A/B rows in the table below). 
Table 5. Statistical Analysis - Pairwise Treatment Comparison for Relative Lefamulin 
Bioavailability and Food effect: PK Descriptive Population 
The exposure to lefamulin from a 600 mg tablet taken in the fasted state (A) was comparable with that 
observed following a 150 mg IV dose (C). In contrast, due to the negative effect of food on the extent of

lefamulin absorption (shown in rows D/A in the table above), plasma exposures after dosing with 600 mg in 
the fed state (D) were lower vs. the 150 mg IV dose (C) as shown in rows D/C below.  
Table 6. Statistical Analysis - Pairwise Treatment Comparison for Relative Lefamulin 
Bioavailability: PK Descriptive Population 
For each of the dose-corrected AUCs, reflecting the effect of food, the absolute bioavailability was ~26% 
when the 600 mg tablet was taken in the fasted state but ~21% when it was taken in the fed state.  
Influence of food 
The definitive food effect study with the final 600 mg IR tablets was 1106, which compared exposures after 
single 600 mg lefamulin doses in the fasted state (A), the fasted state with breakfast (high fat/kcal) one hour 
after dosing (B) and one hour after breakfast had been completed (C). The highest lefamulin AUC occurred in 
the fasted state and the lowest with dosing one hour after breakfast had been completed. Mean Cmax was also 
lowest when dosing was one hour after breakfast and median Tmax was delayed. The mean terminal 
elimination t½ was not affected.

Distribution 
Protein binding 
In an in-vitro study using equilibrium dialysis, lefamulin binding to human plasma proteins was saturable and 
was estimated at 78% (range 73-88%). At typical plasma concentrations achieved with the proposed IV and 
oral dosing regimens, the applicant expects that lefamulin is ~ 87% bound to plasma proteins and this

correction factor was applied to total drug plasma levels in study 1005 (ELF study) to estimate free drug in 
plasma.  
Mean lefamulin protein binding was > 94% at 1, 3 and 8 h in the renal impairment study and similar between 
the three groups. Protein binding increased ~2% to 3% as lefamulin concentrations decreased. In the hepatic 
impairment study, subjects with moderate hepatic impairment had mean protein binding values between 
89.2% and 92.8% and subjects with severe hepatic impairment had mean values between 86.5% and 
90.8%, compared to 94.8% to 97.1% in the normal controls.  
Blood to plasma distribution 
In the mass balance study, the whole blood to plasma ratios suggested no preferential binding of lefamulin 
into RBCs. 
Lung (ELF) and tissue distribution after 150 mg IV dose 
In study 1005, conducted at the Medical University of Vienna where lefamulin was assayed for this study 
using LC-MS-MS, lefamulin 150 mg IV (in 400 mL normal saline infused over 60 min) was administered to 12 
healthy male subjects aged 18 to 55 years.  
•  Blood samples were obtained at frequent intervals up to 24 h.  
•  Epithelial lining fluid (ELF) samples were taken from 3 subjects at each of 1 h, 2 h, 4 h or 8 h after 
start of infusion.  
•  Microdialysate (MD) was collected from subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle pre-dose (each 30 
min) and then at intervals for 24 h.  
ELF concentrations were corrected based on plasma and ELF urea concentrations. It was assumed that 13% 
lefamulin in plasma was unbound. The table below summarises the PK data, including the AUC ratios based 
on comparing total drug between compartments and comparing total drug in peripheral compartments with 
free drug in the central compartment (plasma).

Table 9. Summary of the main PK parameters of BC-3781 administered as a 1-hour infusion of 150 
mg BC-3781 (PK set) 
The individual lefamulin concentrations in ELF approached equilibrium with total plasma levels by 2 h after 
start of infusion. Exposure in ELF was ~75% of that in plasma (accumulation ratio for AUC0-8 of 0.75) based 
on total drug but it was estimated to be 5.7-fold the unbound drug level in plasma. 
Mean PK parameters in the interstitial space of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissues were 
similar. When calculating the accumulation ratios in skeletal and adipose tissue vs. the free fraction in 
plasma, the exposure in tissues was similar to plasma exposure (98% and 87% for AUC0-24).  
Equilibration occurred by 15 min post-dose and free concentration-time profiles in tissue and plasma closely 
resembled each other, indicating very fast exchange within the central compartment and interstitium. 
Elimination from ELF and adipose and skeletal muscle tissue followed the elimination of lefamulin from the

central compartment (plasma) so that no clinically important accumulation was predicted following multiple 
doses. 
Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) 
Steady state in plasma is typically reached after 4 doses of BID oral or IV administrations. Estimates of Vss 
have been between 116-160L (e.g. 132 L in study 1005 described above). These estimates are 3-5-fold TBW, 
indicating considerable distribution of lefamulin into the extravascular space. 
Metabolism 
In-vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 3A5 were the major lefamulin-metabolising enzymes. 
In 1013 after the IV dose of 150 mg 14C-lefamulin the circulating BC-8041 levels were between 0.8% and 
6.7% of total radioactivity (accounting for 2.7% of total based on AUC0-∞). After an oral dose of 600 mg 14C-
lefamulin the BC-8041 levels were between 8.3% and 22.0% of total radioactivity (accounting for 12.2% of 
total based on AUC0-∞ and this was the only metabolite to exceed 10% of total plasma radioactivity. 
Metabolites accounting for >10% of the total radioactivity in excreta (faeces [IV and oral] and urine [IV]) 
resulted from mono- and di-hydroxylation, from phase II conjugation of mono-hydroxylated metabolites with 
pentose (C5-sugar) and from direct conjugation of lefamulin with pentose. Urine from subjects dosed orally 
contained less than 10% of the dose so that metabolite profiling was not performed on these samples.

In addition to study 1013 several studies evaluated the PK of the mono-hydroxy metabolite BC-8041. For 
example, study 1107 evaluated plasma concentration-time profiles of BC-8041 with results summarised 
below.  
Whilst plasma exposures to the metabolite were very low compared to parent drug, they were very similar 
between the 600 mg tablet and 3 x 200 mg capsule doses administered in the fasting state (A and B). The 
negative effect of food on parent drug also impacted the metabolite levels after dosing with 600 mg tablets

as shown by the comparison between A and D. Metabolite exposures were lower after the IV dose (C), and 
less than 25% of those observed with 600 mg oral doses, indicating less conversion of parent to metabolite 
with IV vs. oral dosing.

Elimination 
Study 1013 was a mass balance study with single IV and PO doses in which cohorts of 5 healthy male 
subjects received either: 
A. 60 min IV infusion of 150 mg 14C-lefamulin containing up to 4.3 MBq [117 μCi] 14C in the fed state (30 min 
after the start of a light breakfast)  
B. 600 mg 14C-lefamulin containing up to 4.1 MBq [112 μCi] 14C as 3 × 200 mg oral capsules in the fasted 
state (following an overnight fast of a minimum of 10 h) 
IV dose 
Cmax for lefamulin and total radioactivity occurred at either 0.75 or 1 h post-dose and then declined in parallel 
in a multiple-phasic manner. Plasma lefamulin was detectable for 96-120 h post-dose, whereas total 
radioactivity remained quantifiable for 12-48 h post-dose. The elimination half-lives ranged from 15.3 - 18.9 
h for lefamulin (GM 16.3 h) and from 4.2-8.7 h for total radioactivity (GM 6.5 h). The GM Cmax and AUC 
values were lower for lefamulin (which accounted for 76% of circulating radioactivity) vs. total radioactivity. 
The GM CL, Vss and Vz for lefamulin were 305 mL/min, 157 L and 431 L, respectively, compared to 233 
mL/min, 87 L and 130 L, respectively for total radioactivity. 
Between 89.8% and 96.5% of the radioactivity was recovered by the end of the sampling period (192 h). The 
mean recovery of total radioactivity was 15.5% in urine and 77.3% in faeces. Within the first 24 h post-dose,

13.8% and 0.04% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. By 72 h post-
dose, over 65% of the total radioactivity administered had been recovered. 
Oral dose 
Cmax for lefamulin and total radioactivity occurred between 0.5-2 h post-dose. Plasma lefamulin then declined 
in a multi-phasic manner and remained quantifiable for 96-144 h whereas total radioactivity declined in a 
monophasic manner and was detectable for only 8-12 h. The elimination half-lives ranged from 13.9-22.1 h 
for lefamulin and 3.0-4.1 h for total radioactivity with GM half-lives of 17.8 h and 3.6 h, respectively. Cmax 
and AUC were lower for lefamulin (which accounted for 58% of the circulating radioactivity) vs. total 
radioactivity. The dose-adjusted absolute bioavailability for oral lefamulin, calculated from the GM AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞, was 27.3% and 27.1%, respectively.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population PK analysis 00231-1 
This POPPK analysis (dated July 2011) included total lefamulin plasma concentration-time data from study 
2001; a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with ABSSSI. The structural model was based on a previous POPPK 
model, derived using Phase 1 data [April 2010]. The final POPPK model was a three-compartment model, 
with zero-order input, first-order elimination and saturable protein binding. No significant covariate 
relationships were identified. This model was not used in PK-PD analyses. 
Population PK analysis FRX-BC3781-PMT-1 
This POPPK analysis (dated July 2013) included total lefamulin plasma concentration-time data from 14 
completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Out of the 14 completed studies, 12 studies with a total of 311 
subjects and 6949 observations were used to establish the population PK model. Two studies, with a total of 
40 subjects and 1319 observations, were used for external validation of the model. Observations of lefamulin 
concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) (in total 12 observations from 12 different subjects) and in-vitro 
estimates of mean fraction unbound BC-3781 were also incorporated into the analysis. 
Lefamulin pharmacokinetics was described with a 3-compartment disposition model with first order 
elimination of unbound drug. Unbound concentrations in the central compartment were related to the 
observations of total plasma concentrations via a non-linear protein binding function based on the Richard’s 
equation. Distribution of lefamulin into ELF was better described with an equilibrium compartment approach 
compared to a model that assumed an instantaneous equilibrium between plasma and ELF concentrations. 
The oral absorption of lefamulin was characterised with a dual absorption model with a rapid and a delayed 
absorption path. The oral bioavailability was predicted to decrease from ~20% to 16% when the 600 mg IR

tablet was administered under fed conditions. Furthermore, the rate of absorption decreased significantly 
when given with food.  
A significant time- and dose-dependent increase in oral bioavailability of lefamulin was also identified. 
Overall, the developed population PK model demonstrated good predictive performance of total lefamulin 
plasma concentrations over time, across doses and after IV and oral administration. 
Population PK analysis 00488-1 
This POPPK model (dated November 2018) refined a previous POPPK model (00429-1) by including pooled 
data from four Phase 1 studies (1010, 1011, 1107 and 1108), the Phase 2 study in ABSSSI (2001) and the 
Phase 3 studies in patients with CAP (3101 and 3102). The final PK dataset contained 6205 plasma 
concentrations from 849 individuals. 
The previous model was a 3-compartment disposition model with linear clearance, nonlinear protein binding, 
first-order disposition into and out of the ELF and parallel fast and slow (delayed) first-order absorption 
following PO dosing. This model yielded a suboptimal fit, with a tendency to under-predict the concentration-
time data from Phase 3 patients. Thus, additional structural models were attempted. Ultimately, it was 
determined that the inclusion of patient factors, including study phase, would be required to successfully co-
model the lefamulin PK data across studies.  
The covariate analysis revealed five influential covariate effects:  
•  Clearance (CL) and study phase;  
•  CL and albumin;  
•  Volume of distribution for peripheral compartment 1 (Vp1) and study phase;  
•  Vp1 and WTKG; and  
•  Distributional clearance to peripheral compartment 1 (CLd1) and study phase.  
Incorporation of these statistically significant relationships resulted in moderate improvement in the overall 
population-predicted fit, with individual-predicted fits unchanged from those obtained with the base structural 
model. Despite the statistical significance of these relationships, none of the covariates were associated with 
a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin.  
Pharmacokinetic Exposures and Predicted Accumulation  
Semi-log scatterplots of lefamulin plasma concentrations vs. time, stratified by dose, showed that the Phase 
3 and, to a lesser extent, the Phase 2 plasma concentrations were higher than those observed during Phase 1 
studies at the same IV and PO doses. Further, the lefamulin plasma concentrations collected in Phase 3 CAP 
studies were associated with considerably larger variability than that seen in either Phase 1 or Phase 2.  
The Bayesian post-hoc parameter estimates from the final model were used to generate predicted lefamulin 
concentration-time profiles. Summary statistics for key lefamulin Day 1 and steady state pharmacokinetic 
exposure parameters in ABSSSI and CABP patients enrolled in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials are provided in

Table 13. Summary of key lefamulin plasma pharmacokinetic exposure parameters for patients 
enrolled in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials  
Overall, the model-based simulations indicate that lefamulin is expected to undergo limited accumulation to 
steady-state. Total- and free-drug plasma exposure is predicted to be 15 to 43% higher at steady-state, 
depending on the route of administration and concomitant food intake. ELF concentrations are expected to be 
subject to slightly more accumulation than plasma.  
Metabolite BC-8041 exposures in patients with CAP were predicted to be about 3.5 to 10 times lower than 
those for parent lefamulin. In addition, BC-8041 exposures were about 1.5 to 3 times higher after oral vs. IV

administration, consistent with the results of Phase 1 studies (BC-8041 was not assayed for samples obtained 
in Phase 2).  
Impaired renal function 
Study 1011 evaluated PK after a single 150 mg IV dose in groups with: 
Normal function: 7 subjects with CrCLCG ≥90 mL/min were matched to those with severe renal impairment 
with regard to gender, age (±10 y) and weight (±10 kg) 
Severe impairment: 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR-MDRD <30 mL/min/1.73m2) 
ESRD on dialysis: 8 subjects requiring haemodialysis; these subjects also received an on-dialysis dose such 
that dialysis began within 1 hour after the study drug infusion had completed. 
Over 36 h post-dose, mean lefamulin and BC-8041 plasma Cmax concentrations were comparable between the 
normal and severe groups but the AUC was higher in the latter (lefamulin 12262 vs. 9004 ng.h/mL; BC-8041 
695 vs. 413 ng.h/mL). Lefamulin and BC-8041 exposures were similar between the On-dialysis and Off-
dialysis treatment periods. Lefamulin and BC-8041 were not measurable in the dialysate, and no meaningful 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics when dialysis was performed. It was concluded that 
lefamulin can be administered without regard to renal function or to the timing of haemodialysis.  
Impaired hepatic function 
In 1010 a single 150 mg IV dose was given to:  
• 
• 
• 
Subjects with normal hepatic function (matched to subjects with hepatic impairment) 
Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9 points; Class B) 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score ≥10 points, Class C) 
Mean lefamulin and BC-8041 plasma concentrations were mostly comparable across the 3 groups for the first 
12 h, followed by slightly slower rates of elimination for subjects with hepatic impairment. Mean lefamulin 
Cmax decreased with decreasing hepatic function. Lefamulin and BC-8041 AUCs increased with decreasing 
hepatic function. Lefamulin CL decreased slightly with hepatic impairment but CLr increased >2-fold in 
subjects with hepatic impairment, which may have helped compensate for any possible decreases in 
elimination due to hepatic impairment. It was proposed that some differences may be related to distribution 
of lefamulin into ascitic fluid. It was concluded that no dose adjustment is necessary according to hepatic 
function.

concentrations. The age range of subjects included in the POPPK analysis was as shown below.

Lefamulin inhibited CYP3A4/5 (IC50=3.0 to 15 μM) using pooled HLMs. There was a very low inhibition 
potential against CYP3A-mediated testosterone hydroxylation (IC50 > 300 μM) while midazolam 
hydroxylation was inhibited with an IC50 value of 5.5 μM. 
o  Weak inhibition of CYP2C8 (IC50=73 μM, Ki=41 μM) was observed in HLMs.

Lefamulin is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OCT1 and the efflux transporter P-gp.

Lefamulin is not a substrate of the efflux transporters BCRP, BSEP, MATE1 or MATE2-K nor is it a 
substrate for the uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
Lefamulin showed P-gp inhibitor potential (IC50=13.8 to 34.1 μM).  
Induction of P-gp was not investigated but is unlikely due to no induction of CYP450 enzymes. 
Lefamulin inhibited the hepatic efflux transporter BSEP, the efflux transporter BCRP, the hepatic uptake 
transporter OCT1 and the efflux transporter MATE1.  
Very low inhibition was seen with hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  
There was no inhibition potential for the renal transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and MATE2-K. 
In vivo 
The clinical DDI studies and their results are summarised below. 
Table 18. Clinical Drug-Drug Interaction Studies conducted with lefamulin 
o  When lefamulin PO was given with midazolam PO, the midazolam AUCs were ~3-fold higher on oral co-
administration and Cmax was ~2-fold higher. 
o  When lefamulin PO was given with ketoconazole PO the lefamulin AUC increased by ~2.5-fold while Cmax 
increased ~1.5-fold. CL/F and Vd/F were reduced to about 30% on co-administration but t1/2 was 
unaffected. Co-administration also increased plasma exposures to the metabolite BC-8041, with

reductions in CL/F and Vd/F but with an increase in t1/2 by ~ 3 h. The parent to metabolite ratio was not 
affected. 
o  When lefamulin PO was given with rifampicin PO the lefamulin AUCs and, to a lesser extent, BC-8041 
AUCs were lower. The molar metabolite to parent ratios (MR Cmax and MR AUC0-∞) increased when 
lefamulin was administered after multiple dosing with rifampicin, i.e. more metabolite was produced vs. 
lefamulin given alone.  
o 
o 
Rifampicin had a lesser effect on IV lefamulin but a greater effect on BC-8041 compared to the effects 
seen with oral lefamulin. This differential effect of rifampicin on lefamulin and BC-8041 resulted in 
marked decreases (~84%) in the metabolite to parent ratios for Cmax and AUC0-∞. 
The impact of these observed effects of rifampicin on lefamulin was assessed by estimating the PTA after 
incorporating the data into the POPPK model (00488-2). The population mean effect of rifampicin on 
bioavailability was a reduction of 58.1% in absolute bioavailability and the effect on clearance was a 
41% increase. Using this model and Monte Carlo simulation, co-administration of rifampicin with IV and 
PO lefamulin was predicted to reduce the MIC values at which PTA was >90% by 1 and 2 dilution values, 
respectively. 
PB-PK modelling 
A PB-PK model was developed and validated against clinical data as described in a separate PBPK model 
development report. The model was used to predict the DDI potential of IV and oral lefamulin at the final 
clinical doses. 
Lefamulin as victim 
o 
The PBPK model predicted reductions in the lefamulin Cmax and AUC of 8% and 30% (IV lefamulin) and 
24% and 43% (oral lefamulin), respectively, when administered with the CYP3A inducer efavirenz. 
o  No important effects on lefamulin when given IV or PO were predicted when co-administered with 
fluconazole (moderate inhibitor of CYP3A) 200 mg QD or fluvoxamine (weak inhibitor of CYP3A4) at 100 
mg BID.  
Lefamulin as perpetrator 
o  Orally administered lefamulin was predicted to result in 42% and 29% increases, respectively, in the 
mean AUC and Cmax of the CYP3A4/2C8 substrate repaglinide, with negligible effects (<10%) predicted 
when lefamulin was administered IV. 
o  Negligible effects on exposures to the CYP3A4 substrates ethinyl oestradiol and zolpidem were predicted 
when lefamulin was administered IV (<10%), whereas Cmax and AUC were predicted to increase by 18% 
and 24% for ethinyl oestradiol and 14% and 37% for zolpidem, respectively, following oral 
administration of lefamulin. Neither effect was considered clinically relevant.

o  Negligible effects were predicted on exposure to the OATP1B1/OATP1B3/BCRP substrate rosuvastatin 
following either IV or oral administration of lefamulin even after applying a 10-fold correction factor to 
account for uncertainty. 
o  Mean increases in Cmax and AUC to the OCT2/MATEs substrate metformin of <20% were predicted 
following IV and oral administration of lefamulin. Accounting for potential uncertainty of the in vitro 
assays (by applying a 20-fold correction factor), the effects on metformin Cmax and AUC were predicted 
to increase to 27% and 60%, respectively for IV lefamulin and 30% and 65%, respectively for oral 
lefamulin. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pleuromutilins inhibit prokaryotic ribosomal protein synthesis by binding to the peptidyl transferase centre at 
the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. 
Primary pharmacology 
The CLSI-recommended MIC assay conditions produced reproducible results. Alternative assay conditions 
resulted in either higher MIC values (anaerobic and CO2 environments, higher inocula, pH 5, pH 6 and 
elevated calcium content [CoNS only]) or lower MIC values (lower inocula and pH 8). Adding polysorbate-80 
at <0.02% did not affect assay results but higher concentrations (0.2% and 2%) resulted in higher MICs. 
MIC results generated using CLSI-recommended media (CA-MHB±HLB or HTM) were similar to those 
generated using EUCAST recommended medium (MH-F) when testing S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. 
catarrhalis. Addition of bovine lung surfactant at up to 4% v/v did not change the lefamulin MICs by more 
than one doubling dilution but increased daptomycin MICs by 160-fold. Addition of human serum (20%, 50% 
and 90% v/v) reduced lefamulin activity by ≤2.5-fold. Whilst BC-8041 plasma levels are ~10% of parent, 
MICs were in the range 8->256 mg/L compared to <0.03 to 0.5 mg/L for lefamulin against the same panel of 
CAP pathogens. Therefore, this metabolite is not expected to contribute to the efficacy of lefamulin 
Based on the table below, which includes isolates collected between 2011 and 2017, the spectrum of activity 
of lefamulin covers most Gram-positive cocci, including some anaerobic species, but not the enterococcal 
species. Lefamulin is active against several of the fastidious Gram-negative species (cocci and cocco-bacilli), 
including those associated with CAP (H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis). MICs of lefamulin are also low for the 
genera associated with atypical pneumonia. Most Gram-negative bacilli (enterobacteria and non-fermenting 
bacilli) are not covered by lefamulin, i.e. they are inherently insusceptible. Additional data have been 
collected for isolates of CAP-relevant species isolated between 2015-2017 have confirmed what is shown 
below. In particular, all S. pneumoniae have had lefamulin MICs ≤1 mg/L, with MIC50 of 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 
of 0.25 mg/L.

Lefamulin was bactericidal in vitro (≥3 log10 reduction in CFU/mL) against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and 
M. pneumoniae at concentrations achievable in plasma and ELF. Using the checkerboard method, lefamulin 
did not antagonise antibacterial agents that also act at the bacterial ribosome.

Resistance 
The spontaneous mutation frequencies for lefamulin in staphylococci and streptococci were low (≤10-9) with 
no stable resistant mutants selected at 4-fold to 8-fold MIC. The intrinsic resistance of E. coli is mediated by 
the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to lefamulin include: 
Target protection by ABC-F proteins (formerly erroneously reported as putative efflux pumps): 
• 
• 
• 
vga(A-E) of Staphylococcus spp. 
lsa(E) of S. agalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus 
sal(A) (this gives intrinsic resistance in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.) 
Modification of the target: 
•  Mutations in rplC and rplD genes encoding ribosomal proteins located outside of PTC 
•  Mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA 
•  Cfr methyl transferase methylating A2503 in the PTC 
Lefamulin binds to the pocket formed between the nucleotides G2576 with U2506 and G2505 in domain V of 
the 23S rRNA. G2576 is a nucleotide also critical for the activity of oxazolidinones. Linezolid MIC levels were 
increased 4-fold to 128-fold by G2576T and MICs of lefamulin were increased 2-fold to 16-fold when 
compared with the MIC90 of clinical wild-type isolates in the same study.  
Efficacy in animal infection models 
Numerous studies were conducted. Some of the more important results include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
In the murine thigh infection model using MSSA and MRSA in immunocompetent and neutropenic 
mice (MNT), lefamulin 50 mg/kg BID subcutaneously gave ~2.5 log10 kill for MSSA and MRSA and 80 
mg/kg BID orally gave ~-3.5 log10 kill for MSSA but 1.3 log10 kill for MRSA.  
In the MNT model the total lefamulin AUC0-24 values after single subcutaneous doses of 20 and 80 
mg/kg were 2.39 and 8.18 μg.h/mL, respectively. The dose-normalised AUC0-24 values were 0.120 
and 0.102 μg.h/mL per mg/kg for respective doses. To evaluate the total lefamulin AUC for the 
calculated daily bacteriostatic doses, the mean dose-normalised AUC0-24 value of 0.11 μg.h/mL per 
mg/kg was used. 
In further MNT studies, single doses of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg lefamulin showed maximum killing of a S. 
aureus and a S. pneumoniae strain at the lowest dose but higher doses delayed regrowth. 
PK-PD index 
A dose fractionation study in the MNT model was conducted to determine the PK-PD index using one S. 
pneumoniae and one S. aureus strain. Lefamulin free drug concentrations (20.8 to 24.6% of total based on 
murine plasma protein binding results) were applied. The fAUC0-24/MIC ratio was considered to be the PK-PD 
index while fT>MIC was considered less important for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus.

and lung infections in neutropenic mice, the EC20, EC50 and the EC80 indicated 4.9-fold, 4.0-fold and 3.4-fold 
greater activity in murine lung vs. thigh infections caused by S. pneumoniae.

For lung infections caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus the median 24 h AUCELF/MIC targets to achieve a 
1-log10 kill were 14.0 and 21.7, respectively. These were derived from plasma PDTs after accounting for the 
2-fold higher total lefamulin concentrations in uninfected mouse ELF vs. plasma.

Secondary pharmacology 
Effect on QTc 
An analysis across Phase 1 data showed a significant relationship between lefamulin plasma concentrations 
after IV and oral dosing with change from baseline in QTcF. IV administration showed a steeper slope 
(0.0045 msec/ng/mL vs. 0.0034 msec/ng/mL) and an elevated intercept (1.6 msec vs. -2.54 msec) 
compared to oral administration, consistent with the higher Cmax for IV dosing. The model estimated that 
QTcF prolonging effects for an IV steady state Cmax (2770 ng/mL) as compared to oral (steady state is 1850 
ng/mL) were approximately 12.5 vs. 6.3 msec. Using historical moxifloxacin data, a 200 mg dose of lefamulin 
gave about 33-66% of the prolongation effect of moxifloxacin. A regression analysis indicated that the 
maximum change in QTcF from baseline is >10 msec at plasma lefamulin concentrations ≥3500 ng/mL.

In the Phase 3 trial 3101, the mean change from baseline in QTcF interval at the steady-state 
assessment was 13.8 msec for IV lefamulin and 16.4 msec for moxifloxacin.  
In the Phase 3 trial 3102 the mean change from baseline in QTcF interval at the steady-state 
assessment was 9.5 msec for lefamulin and 11.6 msec for moxifloxacin. There were no associated 
cardiac arrhythmias of concern and in several categorical analyses the degrees of QTcF change were 
lower for lefamulin.  
In 3101, one lefamulin and 3 moxifloxacin patients discontinued study drug because of prolonged QTc 
while in 3102 one lefamulin patient discontinued for this reason.

used for estimations of plasma PTA were taken from the murine lung infection data, which gave much 
lower PDTs vs. the thigh model (see above). The highest PDTs observed in the neutropenic murine lung 
infection model were: 
S. pneumoniae – 6.05 plasma and 61.8 ELF for 1-log10 kill; 10.7 and 109 for 2-log10 kill 
S. aureus – 5.94 plasma and 60.7 ELF for 1-log10 kill; 15.3 and 157 for 2-log10 kill 
Table 22. Summary of AUC:MIC ratio targets for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus  
The POPPK model was not the final model (00488-1; 2018). The fAUC0-24 for plasma and the AUC0-24 for ELF 
were simulated for 150 mg IV q12h on Day 1. 
PTA based on plasma levels - The PTA for the 1-log10 PDT for S. pneumoniae was 97.9% at a MIC value of 
0.5 mg/L for the median and 97.9% at a MIC value of 0.25 mg/L for the second highest target. Using the 
median PDT for 2-log10 kill, the PTA was 99.6% at MIC 0.25 mg/L and 82.5% at 0.5 mg/L while PTA at the 
second highest PDT for 2-log10 kill was 99.8% at 0.12 mg/L, 87.4% at 0.25 mg/L and 32.2% at 0.5 mg/L.  
PTA based on ELF levels - The PTA for the median 1-log10 PDT was 97.0% at a MIC of 0.5 mg/L for S. 
pneumoniae and 99.4% at a MIC of 0.25 mg/L for S. aureus. At the second highest PDT, PTA was 97% and 
78.8% for respective species and MICs. For the 2-log10 kill PDTs, the PTA for S. pneumoniae was 99.4% for 
the median PDT at MIC 0.25 mg/L and 99.7% at the second highest PDT at MIC 0.12 mg/L. Corresponding 
PTA for S. aureus at 2-log10 kill PDTs was 95.3% at MIC 0.12 mg/L for the median and 99.5% at MIC 0.06 
mg/L for the second highest PDT. 
PK-PD analysis supporting oral lefamulin dose selection for CAP trials (00429-2; 2016) 
The PDTs and approaches to generating the estimated PTA were as described above for the IV dose. The 
POPPK model was not the final model (00488-1; 2018). Free-drug plasma and total-drug ELF concentration-
time profiles from 0-24 h were generated for each simulated subject following 600 mg PO q12h under fed 
and fasted conditions.

PTA based on plasma levels - For the 1-log10 kill fAUC0-24/MIC PDTs for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus the PTA 
for the median PDT on Day 1 was ≥95.5% at a MIC value of 0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae and ≥99.5% at a 
MIC value of 0.25 mg/L for S. aureus. At the MIC90 values (0.25 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) the PTA using 
median targets was 100%.  
PTA based on ELF levels - The report states that simulated total-drug ELF exposures did not match with those 
expected based upon previous analyses. Effectively, it appears that this means that the PTA was lower than 
expected in ELF. For example, using Day 1 PK, the PTA for S. pneumoniae 1-log kill PDTs suggested that only 
MICs of 0.06-0.12 mg/L might be covered by the oral dose and perhaps 0.12-0.25 mg/L on Day 5.  
PK-PD analysis of data obtained based on IV and PO Phase 3 trials (00488-2) 
This report of November 2018 used the final POPPK model (00488-1), which incorporated data from the 
efficacy studies in CAP (3101 and 3102), to evaluate PK-PD relationship(s) for efficacy and evaluate the 
sufficiency of the IV and oral dose regimens. The analysis populations for this exercise included lefamulin-
treated patients with PK data from among the microbiologically evaluable (ME) population. PK-PD 
relationships for efficacy were evaluated using the fAUC0-24/MIC ratio, free-drug plasma AUC, total-drug ELF 
AUC/MIC ratio, total-drug ELF AUC and MIC.  
Lefamulin free-drug plasma and total-drug ELF concentration-time profiles were generated for 5,000 
simulated patients with CAP after administration of 150 mg q12h IV or 600 mg q12h PO in fasted and fed 
conditions for 5 days. Using numerical integration, the free-drug plasma and total-drug ELF AUC0-24 
corresponding to Days 1 and 3 were calculated. The figures below show the plasma free drug AUCs and the 
total drug ELF AUCs by dose regimen for simulated patients. The lefamulin oral dosing regimen under fasted 
conditions gave Day 1 mean and median free-drug plasma AUCs comparable to those achieved after 150 mg 
BID IV but values after oral dosing in the fed state were 38.2 and 41.0% lower, respectively, than those 
based on the IV dosing regimen. Similarly, the Day 1 mean and median total-drug ELF AUC values were 40.7 
and 43.4% lower after oral dosing in the fed state vs. IV dosing. While AUCs all increased from Day 1 to 3, 
oral dosing under fed conditions still gave lower AUCs compared to the other regimens.

All patients with S. pneumoniae or S. aureus at baseline, irrespective of culture type, achieved the non-
clinical free-drug plasma and total-drug ELF AUC/MIC ratio PDTs.  
The PTA for S. pneumoniae on Day 1 exceeded 90% at 0.25 μg/mL for 150 mg IV q12h and 600 mg PO q12h 
administered under fasted conditions. Under fed conditions the oral regimen achieved PTA from 78.5 to 
100%.  
The PTA for S. aureus PDTs at 0.12 μg/mL was >90% regardless of dose route and regimen.

AUC:MIC ratio targets associated with a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline among simulated 
patients after administration of lefamulin IV and PO dosing regimens, overlaid over the MIC 
distribution for S. pneumoniae isolates 
There were 92 lefamulin-treated patients with CAP from 3101 and 3102 who had a baseline pathogen, MIC 
data and were evaluable for early clinical response (ECR) at 96±24 h and investigator-assigned clinical 
response at EOT, TOC or LFU. After exclusion of patients with only positive NP cultures, there were 60 
patients available for analysis. Of the totals (92 and 60) there were 54 and 22, respectively, considered to 
have CAP due to S. pneumoniae. Among the 60 patients, clinical success rates across time points were 84.3 
to 95.0% overall and 73.7 to 86.4% for the subset of 22 with S. pneumoniae at baseline. The results of the 
PK-PD analyses for efficacy failed to demonstrate statistically significant and biologically plausible univariable 
relationships for the parameters tested as listed above. 
The POPPK model for lefamulin was modified to include the effect of rifampicin on PK based on the DDR study 
findings. The resultant model demonstrated an average decrease in relative bioavailability of 58% (19.8% 
CV) and average increase in clearance 41% (9.27% CV).  
Using this model and Monte Carlo simulation, concomitant administration of rifampicin with lefamulin 150 mg 
IV q12h was associated with a loss of one MIC dilution value at which PTA was ≥ 90%. Increasing the dose of 
lefamulin to 200 mg IV q12h resulted in PTA that was comparable to that achieved with lefamulin 150 mg IV 
q12h without rifampicin (≥85% at MIC ≤1 μg/mL for S. pneumoniae; ≥90% at MIC ≤0.5 μg/mL for S. 
aureus based on median free-drug 1-log kill PDTs).  
The effect of rifampicin was more pronounced when given with lefamulin 600 mg PO q12h under fasted 
conditions, such that PTA was satisfactory only at MICs 4-fold lower vs. administration without rifampicin. A 
lefamulin dosing regimen 1800 mg PO q12h would be required achieve similar PTA vs. 600 mg q12h under 
fasted conditions in the absence of rifampicin.

The applicant points out that results for the PK-PD target attainment analyses generated using free-drug 
plasma AUC:MIC ratio targets based on a murine-thigh infection model associated with a 1-log10 CFU 
reduction from baseline for S. pneumoniae were less favourable among all the PK-PD target assignment 
methods. The applicant also points to the trend for increasing percentages of patients with clinical success for 
ECR or IACR as MIC decreased from 0.5 to 0.12 μg/mL. The percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment 
analyses based on the neutropenic murine-thigh infection model for IV and fasted PO dosing regimens across 
all PK-PD target assignment methods were frequently lower than percentages of clinical success at MIC 
values of 0.25 and 0.5 μg/mL.  
Based on plasma targets derived from the lung model, and against the applicant’s randomly-assigned PDT, 
the Day 1 PTA is suboptimal at MIC 0.5 mg/L when dosing in the fed state. PTA at the highest target is 
suboptimal at 0.5 mg/L in all dosing states. Similar findings apply on Day 3. On both days, PTA at the median 
was adequate at 0.5 mg/L for IV and oral dosing.  
Based on ELF targets derived from the lung model, and against the applicant’s favoured randomly-assigned 
PDT, the Day 1 PTA is suboptimal at MIC 0.5 mg/L with IV dosing and oral dosing in the fasted state and is 
suboptimal even at 0.25 mg/L when dosing in the fed state. On day 3, target attainment is satisfactory only

at 0.25 mg/L regardless of dosing conditions. At the highest targets the PTA was poor but PTA at the median 
was adequate at 0.5 mg/L.  
Based on plasma targets derived from the thigh model, and against the applicant’s favoured randomly-
assigned PDT, the Day 1 PTA is suboptimal at MIC >0.12 mg/L with IV dosing and oral dosing in the fasted or 
fed state. However, PTA at the median PDT is just about satisfactory at 0.25 mg/L for IV and oral dosing in 
the fasted state. PTA at the highest target is poor. 
On day 3, target attainment at the median PDT is satisfactory at 0.25 mg/L for IV and oral dosing in the 
fasted state but it is not satisfactory based on the randomly assigned target. At the highest target, only MICs 
up to 0.12 mg/L would be covered by IV and fasted state dosing. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Dose proportionality 
In the IV SAD study 1001, AUC0-∞ increased dose-proportionally over the 25 to 400 mg range. A sub-
proportional increase in Cmax was seen when single IV doses of 75 mg and 150 mg were each administered 
over 1 h in study 1002. This sub-proportional increase in Cmax following IV administration was best predicted 
in the POPPK model after incorporation of the non-linear plasma protein binding (PPB). Although the impact 
of PPB changes on overall PK was limited, the goodness of fit in the model improved after a non-linear free 
fraction function was included. 
In the oral SAD study 1101, AUC0-∞ increases were supra-proportional to the dose from 100 mg to 200 mg 
but dose-proportional from 200 to 400 mg, whereas increases in Cmax were sub-proportional to the dose. Vss 
was not estimated after single or multiple oral doses in 1101 or 1102. The supra-proportional increase in AUC 
from 200 mg upwards is most likely due to saturation of CYP-mediated gut wall metabolism so more 
lefamulin can enter the blood circulation. 
Oral absorption 
With a mean absolute bioavailability from a single 600 mg IR tablet in fasted healthy subjects of 25.8% in 
1107 and 27% in the ADME study 1013, the applicant concluded that a 600 mg oral dose is equivalent to an 
IV dose of 150 mg. This conclusion is based on comparing AUCs when oral dosing is in the fasted state 
against standard bioequivalence criteria rather than considering the entire plasma concentration curves. The 
applicant defends this approach based on the proposed PK-PD index (AUC/MIC ratio).  
After BID oral dosing in the fasted state, steady state was reached after ~2 days, similar to IV dosing. 
Following multiple doses of 600 mg q12h in the fed state in study 1105, lefamulin showed an increase in 
bioavailability at steady state, which the applicant ascribes to lefamulin inhibition of CYP3A affecting first-
pass metabolism in the gut wall, which would be consistent with non-linear PK between 100 mg and 400 mg 
oral doses. Furthermore, oral dosing with 600 mg BID gave a greater increase in AUC0-12 vs. a single dose 
than was observed for 150 mg BID IV vs. a single dose (1.8-fold vs. 1.4-fold). The applicant has considered 
the PTA on day 1 of oral dosing in fasted and fed states, from which it has been concluded that this is 
sufficient without considering a loading dose and regardless of the dosing conditions (see further below).

Food effect 
Whilst a 600 mg oral dose taken in the fasted state was bioequivalent to a single 150 mg IV dose, the GMR 
AUC0-∞ for 600 mg taken in the fed state vs. the IV dose was 84.31% (76.94%, 92.37%). The difference was 
even greater for AUC0-12, with GMR 71.8% (65.4, 78.9). Reflecting these differences, the absolute 
bioavailability of lefamulin from 600 mg IR tablets was reduced from ~26% in the fasted state to 18-21% 
(lowest estimate based on AUC0-12) in the fed state. Moreover, in the definitive food effect study (1106) 
dosing within 1 h before or after a meal reduced plasma exposures and the greatest effect occurred when 
lefamulin was taken after breakfast.  
In both Phase 3 efficacy trials (following a double-blind design vs. moxifloxacin) all oral treatments were to 
be taken 1h before or 2h after a meal, i.e. lefamulin was to be taken on an empty stomach and the morning 
dose was taken after an overnight fast. To reflect Phase 3 dosing conditions and the PK-PD analyses (see 
below), the SmPC for the tablets recommends dosing on an empty stomach. 
Protein binding and estimations of free drug levels in plasma 
Lefamulin binding to plasma proteins is concentration-dependent and saturable. Using equilibrium dialysis, 
lefamulin showed non-linear and saturable plasma protein binding of 73-88% over the range of 
concentrations observed in humans such that the free fraction increased with increasing concentration of 
lefamulin. There was low binding affinity to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. At typical plasma 
concentrations achieved with the proposed IV and oral dosing regimens, the applicant proposed that 
lefamulin is ~ 87% bound to plasma proteins and this correction factor was applied in the lung and tissue 
distribution study 1005. 
This estimate of 87% conflicted with the mean lefamulin protein binding >94% at 1, 3 and 8 h in the renal 
impairment study (including the controls) and the values reported in the hepatic impairment study for 
moderate hepatic impairment (between 89.2% and 92.8%), severe hepatic impairment (between 86.5% and 
90.8%) or normal controls (94.8% to 97.1%). The applicant clarified that different methods were applied, 
including devices from different manufacturers in individual studies, to derive these estimates. However, the 
exact reasons for the differences is unknown. 
Lung and tissue distribution 
In study 1005 there were only 3 subjects at each of the ELF sampling time and the last sampling was at 8 h 
post-dose  whereas  the  dose  interval  is  12  h.  As  expected,  the  IIV  was  considerable  for  ELF  concentrations. 
Overall, this is not considered to be a robust study.  
For  total  drug  AUC0-8,  based  on  3  subjects  per  sampling,  the  ELF  value  was  73%  of  the  plasma  value.  The 
applicant calculated that the total drug ELF to free drug plasma AUC0-8 ratio was 5.7 based on an assumption 
of 13% unbound drug in plasma (see above). It is recognised that if the plasma unbound fraction is even less 
(i.e. if 87% is an under-estimation of plasma protein binding), this would further increase the ratio. On the 
other hand, the applicant’s calculation has ignored protein binding of lefamulin in ELF, which is not considered 
appropriate for any drug that is ≥60% bound to plasma proteins. Even if ELF protein were to be 10% of that

in plasma (e.g. 0.4 g/dL) there might be sufficient impact on free lefamulin, and thus the ELF penetration ratio, 
to affect the PTA.  
The lefamulin Vss is 3- to 5-fold greater than total body water volume in an average adult, indicating 
distribution into the interstitium.  
Metabolism and excretion 
CYP3A4 and 3A5 are the main cytochrome isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of lefamulin.  
In the ADME study 1013, the after radiolabelled IV 150 mg (30 min post breakfast) and oral 600 mg (fasted 
state) doses, the mean recovery in faeces was 77% of the IV radioactivity dose and 88% of the oral 
radioactivity dose whereas mean recovery in urine was 15% and 5%, respectively. Lefamulin accounted for 
most (76% after IV and 58% after oral dosing) of the circulating radioactivity in plasma while the inactive 
mono-hydroxy metabolite BC-8041 accounted for 3% and 12%. No other metabolite accounted for >10% of 
total radioactivity in plasma after IV or oral dosing. The PK of BC-8041 indicated that some conversion occurs 
in the gut, with higher plasma levels after oral vs. IV doses. 
Renal impairment 
Over 36 h post-dose, mean lefamulin and BC-8041 plasma Cmax concentrations were comparable between the 
normal and severe groups. 
Nevertheless, the 90% CIs were wider than 80, 125% for all parameters (with or without the outlier) and the 
AUC GMRs were 123% (82, 184) for lefamulin and 148 (94, 232) for the metabolite. These comparisons were 
based on total drug. Plasma lefamulin AUCs for the 8 subjects on haemodialysis were lower compared to the 
normal function and severe impairment groups. There was no statistically significant difference in AUC between 
the Normal and Dialysis groups.  
In Normal, Off-dialysis and On-dialysis subjects, the respective free fractions were 5.6%, 5.6%, and 5.4% at 
1 h and 3.1%, 3.5%, and 5.0% at 3 h. No correlation between PPB and QTcF could be identified and the 
larger absolute change in QTcF observed in those on HD was thought to reflect underlying differences 
between subjects with severe renal impairment requiring HD and healthy subjects. No subjects in any of the 
renal function status groups had a treatment-emergent QTcF value of >480 msec or a >60 msec increase 
from baseline. 
Hepatic impairment 
The study in hepatic impairment showed relatively modest increases in lefamulin plasma AUCs as hepatic 
function decreased but the 90% CI were very wide. Increases in BC-8041 were greater than those for 
lefamulin, suggesting that handling of lefamulin is somewhat different between groups. In this single dose 
study there was no difference in effect on QTc by hepatic function category. However, a warning appears in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to the effect that lefamulin should be used in patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment only after careful benefit-risk evaluation that takes into account the higher free lefamulin 
concentrations and potential risk of QT prolongation.

Age 
Study 1003 indicated that age per se did not influence lefamulin PK. However, there were only 12 subjects 
aged > 65 years and none was very elderly (maximum 77 years). The median age of subjects providing 
samples included in the POPPK analysis was 57 years old with a range from 18 – 97 years but only 57 were 
aged 75+ years. Taking into account the safety data by age and the warnings that appear in the SmPC, it can 
be agreed that age per se is not a factor requiring dose adjustment. 
POPPK analyses 
In the POPPK analysis 00231-1, a previously developed 3-compartment model with zero-order infusion, first-
order elimination and saturable protein binding provided an adequate fit to the plasma concentrations 
obtained in the Phase 2 ABSSSI study 2001. No significant covariate relationships were identified. PK 
parameters and inter-individual variability (IIV) were estimated with reasonably good precision (%SEM 
values of 30% or less). Overall, the magnitude of the IIV was moderate with the exception of Vcu (CV of 
139%). Bayesian shrinkage was not reported. The goodness-of-fit plots showed a good fit to the data for the 
observed vs individual predicted concentrations. However, for the observed vs population predicted 
concentrations, some biases in the fit of the data are noted which may indicate some model misspecification. 
VPCs were not provided. These issues are not further pursued since this model was not used for final PK-PD 
analyses. 
In the POPPK analysis FRX-BC3781-PMT-1, the final model showed a good predictive performance of total 
lefamulin plasma concentrations over time, across doses and different treatments, both for IV and oral 
dosing. For IV administration, this was supported by the external validation datasets, for which there were 
satisfactory predictions both for single and steady state doses. The protein binding function included in the 
final model was based on clinical total plasma concentration samples and in-vitro experimental data on 
fraction unbound, since only total plasma concentrations were measured in the clinical studies. The ELF 
distribution model was based on very limited data from one study of 12 healthy subjects with one ELF 
observation per subject, which represents a significant limitation. 
In the POPPK analysis 00488-1, the structural model was based on previous modelling efforts, which had 
revealed a lefamulin disposition characterised by a 3-compartment model with linear clearance, nonlinear 
protein binding, first-order disposition into and out of the ELF and parallel fast and slow (delayed) first-order 
absorption following PO dosing. This included fixing PK parameters of CLd2, Vp2, Ka, Ka2, Ftot, FS, ALAG, 
Fumin, Fumax, Fu50 to those from the previous model (00429-1). 
There was high shrinkage of all IIV parameters except clearance but further analyses indicated that this did 
not impact on the results to a substantial extent.  
Some deficiencies are noted in the pcVPCs for the final POPPK model. In the Phase 2 (ABSSSI patients) VPC, 
the model tends to over-predict the median of observed concentrations up to around 10 h post-dose and the 
variability is over-predicted. In the VPC for study 3101, the model tends to over-predict the median of 
observed concentrations whilst variability is reasonably well captured. For study 3102, the model appears to 
capture the central tendency but tends to under-predict variability.

Drug-drug interactions 
Lefamulin as victim 
Oral ketoconazole had a moderate inhibitory effect on lefamulin metabolism (2.65-fold increase in AUC) after 
oral administration but only a weak effect (1.3-fold increase) after IV administration. The tablet SmPC 
contraindicates use with strong CYP3A inhibitors. No important effects on lefamulin when given IV or PO were 
predicted when co-administered with fluconazole (moderate inhibitor of CYP3A) 200 mg QD or fluvoxamine 
(weak inhibitor of CYP3A4) at 100 mg BID.  
Rifampicin had a moderate effect on oral lefamulin (decrease in AUC to 28%) but only a weak effect on IV 
lefamulin (decrease in AUC to 73%). Using a modified POPPK model to include the effect of rifampicin, 
concomitant administration with IV lefamulin and oral lefamulin was predicted to result in loss of one or two 
MIC doubling dilutions, respectively, at which PTA was ≥ 90%. The PBPK model predicted reductions in the 
lefamulin Cmax and AUC of 8% and 30% (IV lefamulin) and 24% and 43% (oral lefamulin), respectively, when 
administered with the CYP3A inducer efavirenz. Given that the dose of lefamulin is anyway poorly supported 
by PK-PD analyses, both SmPCs contraindicate use with strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A. 
Lefamulin as perpetrator 
Oral lefamulin had moderate inhibitory effects on the metabolism of oral midazolam (AUC increased 3.2-fold) 
but IV lefamulin had only a weak effect (upper bound of 90% CI 167%). Co-administration of IV and oral 
lefamulin with CYP3A substrates that prolong QTc is contraindicated. 
Oral lefamulin had an unimportant effect on digoxin. Whilst this is not the most sensitive substrate for 
detection effects on P-gp the lack of effect could be accepted as evidence that no SmPC statements are 
needed on use of lefamulin with P-gp substrates. 
The PBPK model predicted that oral (but not IV) lefamulin would increase the AUC and Cmax of the 
CYP3A4/2C8 substrate by 42% and 29%, respectively. Normally if the basic model suggests inhibition, the 
SmPC should have a contraindication until a clinical study confirms the extent of the inhibition, when 
appropriate advice on concomitant use should be given as needed. To justify lack of a contraindication for use 
with CYP2C8 substrates based on the mechanistic static model in lieu of a clinical study, the applicant must 
address the outstanding question. 
Using the PBPK model, Cmax and AUC were predicted to increase by 18% and 24% for ethinyl oestradiol and 
14% and 37% for zolpidem, respectively, following oral administration of lefamulin.  
Negligible effects were predicted on exposure to the OATP1B1/OATP1B3/BCRP substrate rosuvastatin 
following either IV or oral administration of lefamulin even after applying a 10-fold correction factor to 
account for uncertainty. Mean increases in Cmax and AUC to the OCT2/MATEs substrate metformin of <20% 
were predicted following IV and oral administration of lefamulin. Accounting for potential uncertainty of the 
in-vitro assays (by applying a 20-fold correction factor), the effects on metformin Cmax and AUC were

predicted to increase to 27% and 60%, respectively for IV lefamulin and 30% and 65%, respectively for oral 
lefamulin. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Microbiology 
The spectrum of antibacterial activity of lefamulin supports selection of CAP as a target indication. Lefamulin 
inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit. Several mechanisms of resistance 
have been found in various species relevant to CAP. Some of these can confer a degree of cross-resistance to 
other protein synthesis inhibitors, including lincosamides and streptogramins. Also, the G2576T point 
mutation associated with linezolid resistance in S. aureus can increase lefamulin MIC by 2-16-fold.  
Serial passage studies indicated a low rate of selection of resistant mutants. Furthermore, in surveillance 
studies conducted over several years, low proportions of strains collected have had lefamulin MICs ≥ 1 mg/L. 
Those that have been characterised have generally been found to have recognised mutations associated with 
reduced susceptibility.  
PK-PD index 
Dose fractionation was conducted using the mouse neutropenic thigh infection model (Wicha WW, Craig WA, 
Andes D. In vivo pharmacodynamics of lefamulin, the first systemic pleuromutilin for human use, in a 
neutropenic murine thigh infection model. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2019;74(Suppl 3):iii5-iii10.). Serum 
protein binding values on 3 pooled samples from mice were 79.2% at around 0.120 μg/ml, 77.2% at around 
0.530 μg/ml and 75.4% at around 3.250 μg/ml.  
Using these estimates, the report and the applicant’s summary of microbiology state that Because of the 
moderate plasma protein binding of lefamulin, free drug concentrations (20.8 to 24.6% of total serum 
concentrations) were used to calculate the magnitude of the various PK/PD indices. The applicant is unable to 
clarify exactly how the range was applied to each total drug value to determine the corresponding free drug 
concentration. For the S. pneumoniae strain the fAUC0-24/MIC ratio gave the best correlation with 
antibacterial activity whereas for the S. aureus strain the fT>MIC was just as good as a potential PK-PD 
index.  
Plasma PDTs 
Comparison across studies showed that fAUC0-24/MIC ratios associated with stasis and 1-log kill of S. 
pneumoniae were much lower in the murine lung infection model vs. murine thigh infection model. For 
example, the plasma fAUC0-24/MIC for 1-log kill of S. pneumoniae was 8.92 in the thigh model vs. 1.51 in the 
lung model. The 1-log10 and 2-log10 kill plasma PDTs used for estimations of PTA when selecting the IV and 
oral lefamulin doses for Phase 3 CAP studies were taken from the murine lung infection model data. For 1-log 
kill of S. pneumoniae, the plasma fAUC0-24/MIC values used for estimating PTA were the median (1.37) and 
the second highest value (2.73) whereas the highest value in the applicant’s experiments was 6.05.

ELF PDTs 
The ELF PDTs were derived from the plasma PDTs determined in mice after accounting for the observation 
that uninfected mouse total lefamulin levels in ELF were ~2x those in plasma. The applicant placed great 
weight on the PTA in ELF, but this approach has not been accepted previously as the primary method to 
support dose selection when treating lung infections.  
Furthermore, the plasma PDTs against which plasma PTA was initially estimated were those documented in 
the murine lung infection model, which were substantially lower than those derived from the thigh infection 
model. Therefore, additional analyses were requested using different PDTs, including the plasma PDTs 
derived from the thigh model (see below). 
PK-PD analysis of data obtained during IV and PO Phase 3 trials (00488-2) 
This exercise used the final POPPK model and the applicant’s initial analyses reported the day 1 and day 5 PK 
and PTA for IV and oral administrations using PDTs derived from the murine lung model. The lefamulin oral 
dosing regimen under fasted conditions gave Day 1 mean and median free-drug plasma AUCs comparable to 
those achieved after 150 mg BID IV but values after oral dosing in the fed state were 38.2 and 41.0% lower, 
respectively, than those based on the IV dosing regimen. The effect of dosing conditions was still apparent on 
Day 3.  
Using the updated POPPK model, the plasma and ELF PTA was estimated against the median non-clinical 
PDTs and against randomly assigned AUC/MIC ratio targets based on an estimated log normal distribution of 
AUC/MIC ratio targets associated with a given endpoint for each pathogen. Again, these were based on the 
murine lung model. The plasma PTA at the median PDT for S. pneumoniae on Day 1 exceeded 90% at 0.5 
mg/L for 150 mg IV q12h and 600 mg PO q12h administered under fed or fasted conditions. Dosing in the fed 
state was not supported by PTA against randomly assigned targets. The ELF PTA was more sensitive to the 
effect of dosing in the fed state and overall supported coverage of S. pneumoniae only up to 0.25 mg/L. The 
PTA for S. aureus PDTs at 0.12 mg/L was >90% regardless of dose route and regimen but only plasma PTA 
supported sufficiency up to 0.25 mg/L.  
After submitting additional analyses at D120, it was clear that the Day 1 PTA is suboptimal at MIC 0.5 mg/L 
for S. pneumoniae based on randomly-assigned plasma targets derived from the lung model when dosing in 
the fed state. PTA at the highest target was suboptimal at 0.5 mg/L in all dosing states. Similar findings 
applied on Day 3. On both days, PTA at the median was adequate at 0.5 mg/L for IV and oral dosing.  
Based on ELF targets derived from the lung model, and against the randomly-assigned PDT for S. 
pneumoniae, the Day 1 PTA was suboptimal at MIC 0.5 mg/L with IV dosing and oral dosing in the fasted 
state and was suboptimal even at 0.25 mg/L when dosing in the fed state. On day 3, target attainment was 
satisfactory only at 0.25 mg/L regardless of dosing conditions. At the highest targets the PTA was poor but 
PTA at the median was adequate at 0.5 mg/L.  
Based on plasma targets derived from the thigh model, and against the randomly-assigned PDT for S. 
pneumoniae, the Day 1 PTA was suboptimal at MIC >0.12 mg/L with IV dosing and oral dosing in the fasted 
or fed state. However, PTA at the median PDT was just about satisfactory at 0.25 mg/L for IV and oral dosing

in the fasted state. PTA at the highest target was poor. On day 3, target attainment at the median PDT was 
satisfactory at 0.25 mg/L for IV and oral dosing in the fasted state but it was not satisfactory based on the 
randomly assigned target. At the highest target, only MICs up to 0.12 mg/L would be covered by IV and 
fasted state dosing. 
In conclusion, the IV and fasted oral doses of lefamulin were predicted to be suboptimal for S. pneumoniae 
and not adequate to cover organisms with MICs up to 0.5 mg/L. Some analyses indicated that doses were 
not even adequate for organisms with MICs of 0.25 mg/L. Oral dosing in the fed state could not be 
supported. 
The applicant has presented a rationale for the proposed MIC interpretive breakpoints and has approached 
EUCAST to set interpretive breakpoints for lefamulin in the EU. 
The final susceptibility testing breakpoints established by the EUCAST were: 
Organism  
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
QTc prolongation 
MIC breakpoints 
(mg/L) 
Susceptible (≤S) 
0.5 
0.25 
Resistant (>R) 
0.5 
0.25 
Using Phase 3 patient data, the effect of lefamulin on QTcF at the recommended clinical dose closely 
approximated to that of moxifloxacin. For both agents, the magnitude of mean effect was less with oral 
dosing but was >10 msec for both after IV and 9.5-11.5 msec for oral dosing. In addition to these mean 
effects, the categorical analysis showed only slightly less issues for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that oral lefamulin must be given on an empty stomach. The CHMP also considered that 
there is a significant risk for loss of efficacy if lefamulin is given with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers and 
concomitant use is therefore contraindicated in IV and tablet SmPCs. Regarding QTc prolongation, use of 
lefamulin is associated with a significant risk for QTc prolongation similar to that of moxifloxacin. There are 
insufficient data to predict whether the risk of arrhythmias may also be similar. The risk of QT prolongation is 
expected to be enhanced when oral lefamulin is given with strong inhibitors of CYP3A and concomitant use is 
therefore contraindicated in the tablet SmPC. Finally, the PK-PD analyses do not provide robust support the 
selected IV and oral dose regimens for treatment of CAP, especially when due to S. pneumoniae with MICs at 
the upper end of the normal range.

In both trials, oral treatments were to be taken 1h before or 2h after a meal and 2h before or 4 h after any 
oral cationic substances (e.g. aluminium, zinc, iron).  
Objectives 
The primary objective in both trials was to demonstrate the non-inferiority (NI) of lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin 
for the treatment of CAP. For the EU, NI was based on the Investigator’s Assessment of Clinical Response 
(IACR) at Test of Cure (TOC; on day 5 to 10 post-treatment) in the Modified ITT (mITT) and Clinically 
Evaluable at TOC (CE-TOC) analysis sets. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The EMA co-primary endpoints were the percentages of subjects with an IACR of success at TOC in the mITT 
and CE-TOC populations. 
Causative pathogens were identified by culture of respiratory or blood samples, polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), serology or urine antigen testing. Isolates forwarded to the central laboratory included S. 
pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, L. pneumophila, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Also, all blood culture and any BAL and pleural 
fluid isolates were forwarded.  
Serology was conducted at a central laboratory for evidence of acute infection with L. pneumophila, M. 
pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae based on a ≥4-fold increase in IgG antibody titre (acute/convalescent) and 
reaching ≥1:128 for L. pneumophila or ≥1:160 for M. pneumoniae. Screening urine samples were tested at 
the study site for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila antigen.  
A portion of each screening sputum sample was sent to a specialty laboratory for pathogen identification by 
real-time PCR according to determination criteria as follows:

Analysis populations 
o 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) = all randomised  
o  Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) = all randomised who received at least one dose 
o  Microbiological Intent-to-treat (microITT) = all ITT with at least 1 baseline bacterial pathogen 
diagnosed by any protocol-listed method known to cause CAP (defined in SAP only) 
o  microITT-2 = all ITT with at least 1 baseline bacterial pathogen from a diagnostic method other than 
PCR. Thus, the following were not considered pathogens in the microITT-2 population: 
•  S. pneumoniae from RQ-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab 
•  S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus or M. catarrhalis from RQ-PCR of sputum 
•  L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae from RT-PCR of sputum

o  Clinically Evaluable (CE) = 3 sets were defined according to visits completed (i.e. CE-EOT, CE-TOC 
and CE-LFU) in protocol-compliant subjects with visits within the protocol defined window for each 
visit. 
o  Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) = corresponding to CE, but excluded if they had CAP caused only by 
a pathogen resistant to moxifloxacin or non-susceptible to lefamulin (central laboratory); 
Enterobacteriaceae or a non-fermenting Gram-negative pathogen (except for L. pneumophila and M. 
catarrhalis). 
EU primary analysis 
o  The co-primary endpoints for the EU were the investigator-assigned clinical response (IACR) (clinical 
success) rates at TOC in the mITT and CE-TOC populations.  
o  The NI test was a 1-sided hypothesis test performed at the 2.5% level of significance, and was based 
on the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI.  
o  The primary analysis was adjusted for the randomisation stratification factors except that the number 
randomised in the US was too small to allow for adjustment for geographic region.  
o 
If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in IACR success rates in both the mITT and CE-TOC 
populations was > -10%, then the null hypothesis was rejected and NI was concluded.

The study was conducted between 23-Feb-16 and 12-May-17. The CSR is dated 17-Sep-18. 
• 
Participant flow  
There were 551 subjects randomised (ITT) of which 546 received study drug (mITT; 273 in each group). 
There were 29 (10.5%) lefamulin and 27 (9.8%) moxifloxacin subjects who discontinued assigned study 
treatment while 27 (9.8%) and 19 (6.9%) in respective groups discontinued the study but > 95% completed 
the IACR at TOC assessment. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs and subject 
withdrawal and the most common reason to discontinue study was subject withdrawal.  
• 
Baseline data 
Study subjects were primarily White (86.8%) and male (59.9%) with a mean (SD) age of 60.3 (15.6) years. 
Overall, 43.6% were ≥65 years of age (25.4% 65 to 74 years and 18.1% ≥75 years) with more subjects ≥65 
years in the lefamulin group (47.8% vs. 39.3%). Approximately 76% had normal or mildly impaired renal 
function and only 3 per group had severe impairment. Based on data entered in the eCRF, 27.8% were PORT 
Risk Class IV or V (only 7 were V).

Table 32. Baseline Disease Characteristics (ITT Analysis Set) 
There were 25.0% lefamulin and 25.8% moxifloxacin subjects who had received any prior systemic 
antibacterial medications within 72 h for the current episode of CABP.  
In the microITT population (comprising ~58% of the ITT population), 294 (92.5%) had a sputum culture 
performed but only 55 (18.7%; 36 lefamulin and 19 moxifloxacin) had a pathogen identified of which the 
most common in those with adequate samples was S. pneumoniae (8.7% lefamulin vs 4.1% moxifloxacin). 
The microITT-2 population (at least one CAP pathogen from a diagnostic method other than PCR) comprised 
one third of ITT subjects. While S. pneumoniae was reported for 45.2% lefamulin vs. 51.8% moxifloxacin 
subjects in this population, many were based on urinary antigen or nasopharyngeal culture. 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
The mean total duration of treatment (IV and oral combined) was 7.2 days for lefamulin and 7.1 days for 
moxifloxacin. Mean durations of IV study drug treatment were 5.9 vs. 5.7 days and 104 (38.1%) vs. 121 
(44.3%) switched to oral study drug for mean durations of 3.8 vs. 3.5 days.  
Lefamulin was non-inferior to moxifloxacin in the EU primary analysis in the mITT and CE populations based 
on the pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Furthermore, when the unadjusted 95% CIs were computed using 
a continuity corrected Z-test (designated b), the lower limits of the unadjusted 95% CIs were -9.2 and -8.7 in 
the mITT and CE-TOC populations, respectively.

Table 34. Investigator’s Assessment of Clinical Response at TOC by Protocol Version (mITT and 
CE-TOC Analysis Sets) 
Results within subgroups were similar to overall results except for those aged <65 years and ATS severity 
criteria = yes, in which the 95% CIs did not include zero. Subjects who met ATS severity criteria were 
younger than the overall study population (median age ~52 years vs. ~61-64 years) and had a higher rate of 
PORT Risk Class IV CAP (26/54 [48.1%] lefamulin and 18/48 [37.5%] moxifloxacin vs. 27.5% and 25.5%, 
respectively, in the overall study population. Thus findings in the subgroup <65 years are confounded by 
subjects who met ATS severity criteria. As a PORT Risk Class ≥III was required for study entry, and age is 
heavily weighted in the calculation of PORT score, younger subjects needed to meet more age-independent 
severity criteria to be eligible. When subjects who met ATS severity criteria were removed from the analysis, 
the difference in IACR success rate between subjects <65 years of age and subjects ≥65 years of age was 
smaller (see table below).

by ATS Severity Criteria and Age (mITT Analysis Set) 
While overall study drug discontinuation rates were similar between treatments, among subjects in the ITT 
population who met ATS severity criteria a greater proportion of subjects in the lefamulin group discontinued 
study drug than in the moxifloxacin group: 14/54 (25.9%) lefamulin subjects vs. 3/48 (6.3%) moxifloxacin 
subjects.

Post hoc analyses were performed using updated ATS severity criteria (confusion, uraemia, RR ≥30 
breaths/min, PaO2/FiO2 ≤250 mmHg, multilobar infiltrates and age ≥65 years). A post hoc multivariable 
analysis in the per-protocol ATS subgroup did not show any differences between treatment groups which 
could account for the difference in IACR success rates.

Criteria and Post-hoc Modified ATS Severity Criteria (mITT and CE-TOC Analysis Sets) 
A total of 9 subjects (5 lefamulin and 4 moxifloxacin) were known to have died by Day 28 but another 15 (10 
lefamulin) had unknown status at day 28. 
Table 37. 28-day All-cause Mortality (ITT Analysis Set) 
The percentage of failures and the distribution of reasons for IACR of failure were generally similar between 
treatment groups in both analysis sets. The most common reason for IACR of failure in both treatment 
groups was receipt of non-study antibacterial therapy for CAP signs and symptoms. In the mITT population 
the number of indeterminate subjects was slightly higher in the lefamulin group (n=7) compared with the 
moxifloxacin group (n=3).

Clinical and microbiological outcomes in those with pathogens 
The IACR success rates at TOC in the microITT and ME populations were lower for lefamulin (see below). The 
IACR success rates at TOC for the microITT-2 population were 82.8% for lefamulin vs. 84.7% for 
moxifloxacin (95% CI: -13.3, 9.2). IACR success rates at TOC by baseline pathogen were generally 
comparable between treatments except for penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (see below). The number of 
pathogens tested was low, but there was no indication that increasing lefamulin MICs resulted in lower IACR 
success rates at TOC.

As for IACR at TOC, microbiological success rates at TOC for penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae were 15/21 
(71.4%) for lefamulin vs. 17/18 (94.4%) for moxifloxacin. The difference reflected 6 lefamulin subjects with 
S. pneumoniae bacteraemia, only 1 of whom had an IACR of success at TOC. 
By-subject microbiological success rates at TOC in the microITT population were 79.9% for lefamulin and 
85.5% for moxifloxacin. Rates in the ME-TOC population were 83.9% for lefamulin vs. 90.1% for 
moxifloxacin while rates for the microITT-2 population were 82.8% vs. 84.7% (same as IACR at TOC). The 
treatment difference for by-subject microbiological success rates slightly increased between TOC and LFU, 
reflecting an increase in the number of indeterminate subjects in the lefamulin group. 
Seven lefamulin and 3 moxifloxacin subjects had baseline bacteraemia. In the lefamulin group, 6 had S. 
pneumoniae and 1 had S. aureus. In the moxifloxacin group, 2 had E. coli and 1 had B. cepacia. The IACR 
success rate in these subjects was 1/7 (14.3%) for lefamulin vs. 2/3 (66.7%) for moxifloxacin.  
The treatment difference between lefamulin and moxifloxacin increased slightly between TOC and LFU. The 
applicant ascribes this pattern to a higher number of indeterminate subjects in the lefamulin group vs. the 
moxifloxacin group over time (mITT) or to a lower number of evaluable subjects in the lefamulin group (CE 
sets). In the mITT population there were no new failures between EOT and TOC but there were 4 new failures 
(3 lefamulin vs. 1 moxifloxacin) between TOC and LFU. In the CE population there was 1 new failure 
(moxifloxacin) between EOT and TOC and 3 new failures (2 lefamulin vs. 1 moxifloxacin) between TOC and 
LFU. 
Three lefamulin and 2 moxifloxacin subjects had a superinfection. Those in the lefamulin group were due to 
pathogens not within its spectrum of activity (C. koseri, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae). No post-baseline 
pathogens were recovered from lefamulin subjects that showed a ≥4-fold increase in MIC vs. the baseline 
isolate. 
 Results – 3102 
The study was conducted between August 2016 and January 2018. The CSR is dated September 2018. 
• 
Participant flow  
There were 738 subjects randomised (ITT) of which 736 were treated (mITT). There were 25 (6.8%) 
lefamulin and 28 (7.6%) moxifloxacin subjects who discontinued study drug but only 4.6% and 3.8% 
discontinued the study and ~96% completed the IACR at TOC visit. Most study drug discontinuations were 
due to AEs and lack of efficacy. 
• 
Baseline data 
Subjects were primarily white (73.7%) and male (52.4%; 55.9% lefamulin and 48.9% moxifloxacin subjects 
were male). The mean (SD) age was 57.5 (16.3) years and 37.5% were ≥65 years (21.3% were 65-74 and 
16.3% were ≥75 years).

Approximately 81% had normal or mildly impaired renal function and 18% had moderate impairment. Based 
on the eCRFs, 48.8% were PORT Risk Class III or IV and 50.4% were PORT Risk Class II.  
Table 41. Baseline Disease Characteristics (ITT Analysis Set) 
Within 72 hours before randomisation, 21.1% lefamulin and 20.1% moxifloxacin subjects received systemic 
antibacterial medications for the current episode of CAP. One lefamulin and 2 moxifloxacin subjects were 
excluded from the CE population. Most had received amoxicillin-clavulanate. 
In microITT population the most frequently identified baseline pathogens were S. pneumoniae (60.0% 
lefamulin vs. 67.7% moxifloxacin), H. influenzae (27.3% vs. 25.8%), M. pneumoniae (9.8% vs. 7.5%), L. 
pneumophila (7.8% vs. 9.1%), M. catarrhalis (10.2% vs. 5.9%) and C. pneumoniae (7.8% vs. 6.5%). 
Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 13 (6.3%) lefamulin and 6 (3.2%) moxifloxacin subjects and 3 had 
MRSA (2 of which were resistant to moxifloxacin; these were the only cultured CAP pathogens resistant to 
study drugs). Only 351 of the total subjects had a standard sputum culture and only 76/351 (21.7%) had a

pathogen isolated. These 76 subjects comprised only 19.4% of the total included in the microITT population. 
The microITT-2 population comprised 31.4% of the lefamulin ITT and 29.9% of the moxifloxacin ITT subjects. 
S. pneumoniae occurred in 38.8% lefamulin vs. 50.9% moxifloxacin microITT-2 subjects and most of these 
came from NP swabs. 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
The median duration of active treatment was 5 days for lefamulin and 7 days for moxifloxacin. Lefamulin was 
non-inferior to moxifloxacin in the mITT and CE-TOC populations. When the unadjusted 95% CIs were 
computed using a continuity corrected Z-test (b), the lower limits were -6.5 and -8.4 in the mITT and CE-TOC 
populations, respectively.

Sets) 
• 
Ancillary analyses 
Results within the strata defined by prior antibacterial treatment and PORT Risk Class were similar to the 
overall results for ITT and CE populations. Figure 10 indicates that for most subgroups the rates for IACR at 
TOC slightly favoured moxifloxacin as in the primary analysis.

Figure 10. Forest Plot of Investigator’s Assessment of Clinical Response at TOC (Success Rates) 
(mITT Analysis Set) 
A total of 6 subjects (3 lefamulin and 3 moxifloxacin) were known to have died by Day 28 but there were 
another 4 subjects (3 lefamulin, one moxifloxacin) whose status was unknown at day 28. 
The most common reason for IACR of failure at TOC in both treatment groups was receipt of non-study 
antibacterial therapy for CAP. Most of the failures had already occurred by the time of the EOT visit. Six 
lefamulin subjects failed between EOT and TOC due to non-study antibacterial therapy for CAP.  
Clinical and microbiological outcomes in those with pathogens 
The IACR success rate at TOC in the microITT population was 85.9% for lefamulin and 87.6% for 
moxifloxacin (treatment difference -1.8%; 95% CI: -8.7, 5.1). Corresponding rates in the ME-TOC population 
were 88.5% and 91.5%, respectively (treatment difference -3.0%; 95% CI: -9.4, 3.7).  
The IACR success rate at TOC in the microITT-2 population was 83.6% for lefamulin and 90.0% for 
moxifloxacin (treatment difference -6.4%; 95% CI: -15.1, 3.2). 
IACR success rates at TOC for S. pneumoniae in the microITT population were 85.4% lefamulin vs. 85.7% 
moxifloxacin. Among those with PSSP, the IACR success rates were 20/26 (76.9%) for lefamulin vs. 38/38 
(100%) for moxifloxacin. Seven of the 26 in the lefamulin group with PSSP were ECR non-responders and/or 
IACR failures at TOC. Of these 7, 3 received only 1 day of treatment with lefamulin of which one died in the 
setting of ARDS on Day 2 while 2 received 4 days of treatment with lefamulin and had lack of efficacy and 2 
completed 7 days of lefamulin/placebo, one of whom started further CAP treatment on day 8.

Among lefamulin subjects with PSSP, 69.2% were PORT Risk Class III or IV, 34.6% had a CURB-65 score of 
2 or higher, 26.9% met minor ATS severity criteria and 30.8% met modified ATS severity criteria for CABP. 
By comparison, among moxifloxacin subjects with PSSP, 36.8% had a PORT Risk Class III or IV, 26.3% had a 
CURB-65 score of 2 or higher, 13.2% met minor ATS severity criteria and 7.9% met modified ATS severity 
criteria for CABP. There was no difference in the distribution of PSSP serotypes or MLST types between 
treatment groups and no difference in the distribution of lefamulin MIC among subjects who were IACR 
failures vs. successes.  
The number of pathogens for which MIC data were available was small but there was no indication that 
increasing lefamulin MICs resulted in lower by-pathogen microbiological response of success at TOC.

By-subject microbiological response rates at TOC in the microITT population were 85.9% for lefamulin and 
87.6% for moxifloxacin group (treatment difference -1.8%; 95% CI: -9.0, 5.5). Rates in the ME-TOC 
population were 88.5% vs. 91.5% (treatment difference -3.0%; 95% CI: -9.9, 3.9) and rates in the 
microITT-2 population were 83.6% vs. 90.0% (treatment difference -6.4%; 95% CI: -16.0, 3.3). 
Six lefamulin and 9 moxifloxacin subjects had baseline pathogens isolated from blood cultures. In the 
lefamulin group, 3 had S. pneumoniae and 1 subject each had S. aureus, Acinetobacter ursingii and K. 
pneumoniae. In the moxifloxacin group, 5 had S. pneumoniae, 2 had S. aureus and 1 subject each had 
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pasteurella pneumotropica. The IACR success rates were 3/6 (50.0%) for 
lefamulin and 7/9 (77.8%) for moxifloxacin. 
No subjects in the lefamulin group had an IACR of relapse at LFU.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A summary of diagnostic modalities across the two trials is given below. It should be noted that the table 
shows that many patients were positive (and thus eligible for the microITT and/or microITT-2 populations) by 
more than one diagnostic test.

Results specific to the microITT-2 population 
The microITT-2 population excluded subjects who were positive for a pathogen based only on PCR but did 
include those with S. pneumoniae obtained from culture of a NP swab. In each of 3101 and in 3102 the 
microITT-2 population accounted for about one third (30-33%) of the total number randomised. In the 
summary of efficacy, it is further clarified that in the pooled microITT-2 analysis set: 
• 
S. pneumoniae (46.3% of subjects overall) was most often identified by NP swab culture 
(58.8%; 110/187 subjects) and UAT (20.0%; 81/187 subjects); after removing those positive by 
swab culture, the table below from the ISE shows the residual numbers considered to have S. 
pneumoniae at baseline, most of whom were diagnosed based on urinary antigen detection. Note 
that these numbers are not identical to those shown in the summary of efficacy table.

Pathogens from NP and OP Swab Cultures (microITT-2 Analysis Set) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
S. aureus was identified in 25 (6.2%) subjects overall and was most commonly identified by 
sputum culture (80.0%; 20/25 subjects); 
H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were identified in 41 (10.1%) subjects and 7 (1.7%) subjects, 
respectively, primarily by sputum culture for both H. influenzae (9.9%; 40/41 subjects) and M. 
catarrhalis (100.0%; 7/7 subjects); 
The most common diagnostic methodology for M. pneumoniae was serology (84.6%; 44/52 
subjects), followed by oropharyngeal swab culture (32.7%; 17/52 subjects);  
The most common diagnostic methodology for L. pneumophila was serology (73.0%; 46/63 
subjects), followed by UAT (38.1%; 24/63 pathogens); 
For C. pneumoniae, serology was the only diagnostic modality (100.0%; 46/46 subjects). 
As discussed by study above, the IACR at TOC (and the by-subject microbiological responses at TOC) in the 
microITT-2 population were numerically lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin in both trials. Also, in 3101 and 
3102 the pneumococcal microbiological response rates at TOC were numerically lower for lefamulin with a 
larger difference in the oral-only trial 3102. Across the two trials, clinical success rates by S. pneumoniae 
serotypes (only possible to determine in the microITT-2 subset with a positive culture) were consistently 
lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. 
On request, the applicant created a Modified microITT-2 Analysis Set that excludes those who were eligible 
for the microITT-2 Analysis Set only on the basis of a positive culture from an NP swab. This added exclusion 
impacts the numbers deemed to have S. pneumoniae at baseline, because NP swabs were performed only for 
the detection of S. pneumoniae. As shown below, 63 subjects were eliminated from the pooled Phase 3 
dataset after applying this additional restriction.

Table 46. Summary of Subjects Included in the Modified microITT-2 Analysis Set 
As shown below, the exclusion of those who were eligible for the microITT-2 Analysis Set only on the basis of 
a positive culture from an NP swab did not significantly change the rates for IACR at TOC for the individual 
studies or the pooled analysis. Furthermore, although more subjects were excluded from the moxifloxacin vs. 
lefamulin totals, the numerical inferiority for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin persisted.

The rates for IACR at TOC for S. pneumoniae (including phenotypes) in the Modified microITT-2 Analysis Set 
were consistent with results in the original microITT-2 Analysis Set. The overall numerical inferiority for 
lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin for this species persists and, as before, is driven by results in the majority, which 
comprised PSSP.

Justification for pathogens listed in section 5.1 
The applicant’s justification for species claimed to have been successfully treated in trials is based on the 
microITT and microITT-2 populations.

Additional sub-group analyses across the Phase 3 trials 
The initial analyses indicated that patients in the age group 65-74 years who received lefamulin and did not 
meet ATS severity criteria achieved a numerically greater probability of IACR success than those receiving 
moxifloxacin. The opposite was seen in all other subgroups defined by age and ATS severity. Numbers older 
than age 65 and meeting ATS severity criteria are very small. A numerically better outcome was observed for 
subjects receiving moxifloxacin except for the subgroup that was aged >65 years and did not meet ATS 
severity criteria.

None of these terms was deemed significant. An additional model including only 2-way interactions also 
indicated no significant interaction between ATS severity and age group. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support the claimed indication for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the applicant 
conducted two randomised, double-blind and active-controlled Phase 3 trials to evaluate use of IV/PO 
lefamulin in patients with CAP and PORT scores III-V (3101) and PO lefamulin in patients with CAP with PORT 
scores II-IV (3102). Both trials aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. IV/PO or PO 
moxifloxacin as the comparative agent based on the clinical outcome at the test of cure (TOC visit) with a 
10% non-inferiority margin.  
This programme complies with the existing and draft revised CHMP guidance on the development of 
antibacterial agents. In compliance with existing guidance, the mITT and CE populations were considered co-
primary.  
Selection criteria 
These were appropriate, including the restriction on pre-study antibacterial treatment for CAP and 
proportions in each PORT class. It should be noted that patients taking strong P-gp inhibitors or strong CYP3A 
inducers or inhibitors as well as those at risk for QTc prolongation, including concomitant medications with 
this risk, were excluded. 
Treatments 
Lefamulin 
The IV and oral dose regimens were selected solely from PK-PD considerations (see previous sections) and 
are the same as those proposed in the SmPCs. However, the SmPC-recommended options for doses and 
durations are as follows: 
•  150 mg of lefamulin by IV infusion every 12 hours (q12h) over 60 minutes for 5 to 7 days 
•  150 mg of lefamulin by IV infusion q12h over 60 minutes then switch to a 600 mg lefamulin tablet 
orally q12h (at the discretion of the physician) for a total of 5 to 7 days 
•  600 mg lefamulin tablet orally q12h for 5 days. 
In 3101, the initial protocol required that patients with S. pneumoniae bacteraemia, Legionella pneumophila 
or MRSA were to receive 10 days of active treatment while all other patients were to receive 5 days. After co-
implementation of amendments 2 and 3, all patients received 7 days of lefamulin except that patients with 
MRSA continued to receive up to 10 days. The outcomes for those treated before (25% of total) and after 
(75% of total) the amendment are therefore very important for considering the IV and IV/PO durations, as 
discussed below. In 3102 there was a fixed duration of 5 days from the outset so the SmPC recommendation 
reflects this. 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 126/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moxifloxacin 
This was an acceptable comparator. The doses and durations used in the Phase 3 trials reflected the SmPCs 
(IV/PO 400 mg QD for 7-10 days in 3101 and 400 mg QD orally for 7 days in 3102).  
Baseline pathogens 
The applicant defined a microITT population that included all patients with any positive result (as defined by 
test) based on cultures (including NP swab cultures), PCR (of sputa or swabs), serology (for pathogens 
involved in atypical pneumonia) or positive urinary antigen detection test (for S. pneumoniae or L. 
pneumophila). Also defined was a microITT-2 population in which all patients with only PCR evidence of a 
pathogen were excluded. 
In prior applications, the CHMP has accepted positive culture of respiratory tract samples, blood, lung abscess 
material or pleural fluid plus positive urinary antigen tests for the 2 pathogens as above as sufficient to imply 
possible aetiology for the clinical picture. On the basis of these tests, claims for demonstrating efficacy vs. 
specific species have been allowed in section 5.1. Nevertheless, it should be understood that sputum culture 
is not a definitive method to establish causality except for those species causing atypical pneumonia that are 
not part of the normal flora of the nasopharynx. 
For organisms that can be found in the nasopharynx of healthy subjects and so contaminate sputa as it is 
expectorated, finding colonies on culture plates does not necessarily indicate and cannot confirm the 
aetiology of pneumonia. It is a rare occurrence that sputum yields a pure growth of a single species that 
would very strongly suggest causality. 
Finding bacterial DNA in specimens (whether applying PCR to sputa or swabs) means only that live or dead 
bacteria are there. Whilst the applicant provides vast amounts of information on validation (based on 
sensitivity and specificity), results of these tests (although sensitive at detecting the presence of certain 
species and able to speciate) does not assist in determining causality.  
Therefore, the validity of the microITT population is rejected. Furthermore, since culturing organisms from NP 
swabs is not helpful, the microITT-2 population (which includes some patients positive only by NP culture) is 
also not entirely confined to a population that would be considered most likely to have a documented 
pathogen.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study populations 
The study populations are considered to be adequately representative of the CAP patient population typically 
encountered in the EU. In both trials Eastern European patients accounted for a considerable proportion of 
the totals. Treatment and study completion rates were high. Generally, most host and disease factors were 
well-balanced between treatments in both trials. 
Outcomes in the mITT population 
It is acceptable that the primary analysis was conducted in the mITT (all-treated) population since there was 
very little difference in numbers vs. the ITT population, which is the recommended primary analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020

population in the revised guidance. The results in the CE population can be viewed as an important secondary 
analysis.  
Both trials demonstrated non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin in the primary analysis based on 
clinical outcomes at TOC in the mITT populations. The non-inferiority criterion was also met in the CE 
population (87% of total) in both trials. Both trials showed that lefamulin was consistently numerically 
inferior to moxifloxacin for clinical and microbiological success rates at TOC across the pre-defined trial 
populations.  
Outcomes by duration of IV/PO treatment 
In 3101 the mean and median duration of total treatment was 7 days and the duration of IV was near to 6 
days in both treatment groups. Whilst 75% of the total was enrolled after the amendment to increase the 
standard duration of lefamulin from 5 to 7 days, the cure rates at TOC were lower for lefamulin in those 
enrolled prior (5 days) or after (7 days) the amendment. Although the trial was not designed to assess the 
effect of duration, there is no reason to accept the applicant’s proposal that the treatment duration could be 
5-7 days for those who require initial intravenous administration. The SmPC was amended accordingly. 
Outcomes in subgroups 
In 3101 and 3102 lefamulin was consistently numerically inferior to moxifloxacin in several large subgroups. 
In older subjects there did not seem to be lower success rates with lefamulin in either trial. The applicant 
provided a further breakdown of outcomes in age subsets 75-84 and 84+ years, indicating that success rates 
in these subsets were comparable between treatment groups as far as can be judged based on relatively 
small numbers. In light of the discussions over PPB and free lefamulin, it has to be considered that free drug 
levels may have been higher as age increased. However, this is conjecture. 
Mortality 
o 
o 
In 3101, all-cause mortality rates to day 28 were 1.8% (5) for lefamulin vs. 1.5% (4) for 
moxifloxacin but rates including those of unknown status were 5.4% (15) vs. 3.3% (9). Two 
lefamulin and one moxifloxacin patients considered to have S. pneumoniae died. 
In 3102 there were 3 patients per treatment group known to have died by day 28 but rates counting 
those of unknown status were 6 (1.6%) vs. 4 (1.1%). Another 2 deaths occurred in the lefamulin 
group after day 28 so the final total was 5 vs. 3 known deaths. One per group considered to have S. 
pneumoniae died. 
This applicant provided an explanation of the reasons for unknown status of subjects at day 28 in both 
studies, indicating no reason to consider that there were important imbalances between treatments. 
Baseline resistance 
o 
In 3101, 2 (0.7%) lefamulin and 3 (1.1%) moxifloxacin patients were excluded from the ME 
population due to having only pathogens deemed to be resistant (for lefamulin this was based on the 
applicant’s preliminary criteria) to either study drug; these were all enterobacteria or non-fermenters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 128/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
In 3102, 4 (1.1%) lefamulin and 3 (0.8%) moxifloxacin patients were excluded from the ME 
population due to having only pathogens resistant to either study drug; again, these were all 
enterobacteria or non-fermenters. 
On request, the applicant provided analyses of outcomes at TOC in the mITT, microITT and microITT-2 
populations after removing all patients from both treatment groups with any baseline pathogen resistant to 
moxifloxacin. Across all 3 additional analyses, there was no meaningful change in the rates of IACR success 
at TOC. In the mITT Analysis Set, specifically, the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in IACR success 
rates was >-10% for the individual studies and the Phase 3 pool. 
Outcomes in patients with a pathogen 
In line with the primary analyses, the clinical success rates at TOC in the microITT (58% of total enrolled in 
3101 and 53% in 3102) and microITT-2 (32% of total enrolled in 3101 and 31% in 3102) populations were 
lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. The trials were not powered for comparisons of clinical outcomes in 
these sub-populations.  
In the microITT-2 populations, clinical success rates at TOC for S. pneumoniae were 81% for lefamulin vs. 
86.4% for moxifloxacin (34/42 vs. 38/44) in 3101 and 80% vs. 94.6% (36/45 vs. 53/56) in 3102.  
Clinical response rates at TOC by S. pneumoniae serotypes (only possible to determine in the microITT-2 
subset with a positive culture) were consistently lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. Overall, the rates were 
50/62 for lefamulin (80.6%) vs. 65/69 (94.2%) for moxifloxacin and the LFU rates were similar at 79% vs. 
94.2%.  
Nevertheless, the population of major interest consists of those patients with: 
i) acceptable pathogens cultured from any of sputum, BAL, blood or pleuritic fluid or  
ii) a positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila or 
iii) positive serology for L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae  
This group of major interest did not equate with any of the applicant’s pre-defined analysis populations 
because even the microITT-2 population included those with positive cultures from a nasopharyngeal swab. 
On request, the applicant created a Modified microITT-2 Analysis Set that excluded those who were eligible 
for the microITT-2 Analysis Set only on the basis of a positive culture from an NP swab. 
After excluding patients included in the microITT-2 population solely on the basis of a NP swab, the cure rates 
in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (positive sputum culture or urinary antigen test) were numerically 
lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin (28/36 [77.8%] vs. 26/31 [83.9%]) when treatment commenced 
intravenously and 19/25 (76%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%) when treatment commenced orally. Furthermore, among 
patients with positive cultures and documented lefamulin MICs for S. pneumoniae, the cure rates in patients 
treated with lefamulin were 9/10 (90%), 34/41 (83%) and 6/9 (67%) when MICs of lefamulin were 0.12, 
0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. Taking into account also the PK-PD analyses, these collective concerns led 
to a restricted indication that reads as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 129/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Xenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is 
considered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial 
treatment of CAP or when these have failed (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Bacteraemia 
In 3101, 7 lefamulin patients had baseline bacteraemia of which 6 had S. pneumoniae and one had S. aureus 
(but had S. pneumoniae in sputum culture). The success rate was only 1/7 (14.3%). Five of the 6 with S. 
pneumoniae in blood and one other patient with a positive sputum culture failed. One patient with S. 
pneumoniae in blood died from uncontrolled infection. In 3102, 6 lefamulin patients had bacteraemia, of 
which 3 were S. pneumoniae and 2/3 failed although none died. In both trials, success rates in bacteraemic 
patients treated with moxifloxacin (2/3 in 3101 and 7/9 in 3102) were higher than for lefamulin, although 
numbers are very small. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant conducted two pivotal trials in CAP, both of which showed non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. 
moxifloxacin. Nevertheless, the most important pathogen to cover is S. pneumoniae. Taking into account the 
results by pathogen and PK-PD analyses, the final indication was restricted as follows: 
Xenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is 
considered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial 
treatment of CAP or when these have failed (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The number of subjects exposed to any dose of lefamulin across all completed clinical studies was 1242, 
including 712 subjects exposed to target doses in Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies.

Table 54. Number of Subjects Exposed to Lefamulin Across All Clinical Studies 
In study 3101 the mean IV treatment was for 5.9 vs. 5.7 days and 104 (38.1%) vs. 121 (44.3%) patients 
switched to oral study drug for mean durations of 3.8 vs. 3.5 days. In 3102 mean oral treatment was 5 days 
lefamulin vs. 7 days moxifloxacin in accordance with the protocol. 
Adverse events 
The first table below provides an overall summary of the safety profiles observed in Phase 3 trials. 
The second table shows that the most frequently reported AEs in the lefamulin and moxifloxacin groups, 
respectively, were gastrointestinal events, including diarrhoea (7.3% vs. 3.9%), nausea (4.2% vs. 2.0%) and 
vomiting (2.3% vs. 0.6%) driven primarily by AEs occurring during oral administration. In 3102 with oral 
only dosing the most notable imbalance was for diarrhoea, reported by 12.2% lefamulin and 1.1% 
moxifloxacin subjects. In contrast, in 3101 overall, rates for diarrhoea were 0.7% vs. 7.7% in respective 
groups. Infusion site pain in 3101 was reported for 2.9% lefamulin vs. no moxifloxacin subjects.

When examined by SOC, the incidence of AEs in the SOC of Gastrointestinal Disorders was 13.1% in the 
lefamulin group and 10.1% in the moxifloxacin group, mainly reflecting 3102. In the SOC of General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, the incidence of TEAEs was 4.4% in the lefamulin group and 
2.7% in the moxifloxacin group, mainly due to infusion site reactions in 3101. Most AEs were mild (18.6% vs. 
18.3%) or moderate (12.2% vs. 8.6%) in severity. The incidence of severe AEs was similar between groups 
(4.2% and 3.6%, respectively). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs are shown below.

Although the lefamulin infusion conditions were modified before commencing efficacy trials, there was a 
higher rate of TEAEs associated with the infusion in the lefamulin group vs. the moxifloxacin group.

Table 58. Administration Site Reaction TEAEs for Pool 3 during the IV Dosing Period (Safety

During oral treatment (see below), the overall differences in AEs were driven by rates of diarrhoea (12.2% 
vs. 1.1%), nausea (5.2% vs. 1.9%) and vomiting (3.3% vs. 0.8%).

Cardiac events and QTc data 
In Phase 3 trials, AEs mapping to the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported for 2.5% lefamulin and 3.1% 
moxifloxacin subjects, mainly due to a difference with IV in 3101 (2.9% vs. 4%) rather than oral in 3102 
(2.2% vs. 2.4%). An analysis using the MedDRA SMQ of Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (broad) showed 
that 5 subjects (0.8%) in the lefamulin group and 6 subjects (0.9%) in the moxifloxacin group had TEAEs 
within this SMQ. 
Table 60. Treatment-Emergent QT/QTc Prolongation Adverse Events for Pool 3 (Safety 
Population) 
In the lefamulin group two cardiac AEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug. A fatal event of ventricular 
arrhythmia (no ECG confirmation) on Day 20, considered not related to lefamulin, occurred in 3101 in a 72-
year-old male enrolled with PORT Risk Class IV CABP. Due to his history of heavy smoking, pulmonary 
tuberculosis, COPD and coronary artery disease, and baseline ECGs that showed incomplete right bundle

branch block and ST/T wave changes (mean QTcF was 441 msec) he was considered inappropriate for the 
trial and was discontinued after dosing on Day 2.  
ECGs were recorded before the first IV infusion and within 15 minutes after the end of the first infusion of 
study drug on Day 1 and Day 3 in 3101. ECGs were recorded before the first dose of study drug and 1 to 3 h 
after dosing on Day 1 and Day 4 in 3102. The only ECG findings reported as TEAES for >1 subject per 
treatment group were electrocardiogram QT prolonged (0.6% lefamulin, 0.8% moxifloxacin) and atrial 
fibrillation (0.5% lefamulin, 0.6% moxifloxacin). 
At the Day 3/4 post-dose evaluation the mean change from baseline in QTcF was 11.4 ms for lefamulin vs. 
13.6 msec for moxifloxacin group. The mean maximum change in QTcF interval at any time was 16.8 msec 
for lefamulin and 19.3 msec for moxifloxacin and maximum changes in QTcF for individual subjects were 87.7 
msec vs. 98.7 msec. With IV dosing the mean change from baseline in QTcF was 13.8 msec for lefamulin and 
16.4 msec for moxifloxacin while oral dosing gave changes of 9.5 msec for lefamulin and 11.6 msec for 
moxifloxacin.  
Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec were seen in 17.9% and 22.3% of subjects in the lefamulin and 
moxifloxacin groups, respectively, while increases >60 msec occurred in 1.7% and 2.5%. One (0.2%) 
lefamulin and 4 (0.6%) moxifloxacin subjects had QTcF increases >60 msec that resulted in a value of >480 
msec. ECGs following IV dosing showed that 2.6% of lefamulin subjects had a post-baseline QTcF increase of 
>60 msec compared to 1.1% with oral dosing. 
Table 61. Post-Baseline QTcF Values and Increases for Pool 3 (Safety Population) 
The Cardiac Expert Evaluation report concluded that “The QT effect after an IV infusion of 150 mg is not 
larger than that of 400 mg IV moxifloxacin, the standard-of-care. While this effect levels seems small, it is 
prudent to recommend caution when lefamulin is given to patients on other drugs with known effect on the 
QT interval.” The applicant’s conclusion appears to be that “a small effect on QTc prolongation by lefamulin

was demonstrated but does not pose a clinically significant risk of ventricular pro-arrhythmia with appropriate 
precautions and use.” 
Hepatic effects (see also under laboratory findings) 
The incidence of liver AEs was 2.5% in the lefamulin group vs. 3% in the moxifloxacin group. 
Table 62. Liver Safety Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events for Pool 3 (Safety Population) 
Two lefamulin and one moxifloxacin subject discontinued study drug due to hepatobiliary AEs. In the 
lefamulin group: 
•  One had non-serious hepatitis toxic on Day 4, which was moderate in severity and considered to be 
possibly related to study treatment. The event resolved with treatment in 19 days. 
•  One had AEs of increased ALT, AST, ALP and GGT, which were non-serious, moderate in severity and 
considered unrelated to study drug. All events began on Day 5 and resolved without treatment. 
C. difficile 
One lefamulin subject in 3102 had a mild, non-serious AE of C. difficile colitis on Day 12, 1 week after 
completing 5 days of lefamulin. The event resolved on Day 24 after a course of oral vancomycin and was 
considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to lefamulin. Two other lefamulin-treated subjects in 3102 
received metronidazole for diarrhoea beginning on Day 30 and Day 34, respectively. One had a negative test 
for C. difficile and the other was not tested.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
There were no SAEs or deaths in Phase 1 studies. In the Phase 2 study no deaths occurred but 3 lefamulin 
patients had SAEs, none of which was considered treatment-related.  
In Phase 3 trials the numbers confirmed deceased by Day 28 are shown below. Whilst the numbers of 
confirmed deaths were similar in both trials, there were more subjects of unknown status in the lefamulin 
groups such that the known alive rates at day 28 were slightly lower vs. moxifloxacin.  
Table 63. 28-Day All-cause Mortality in Pool 3 (Intent-to-Treat Population) 
Another 4 deaths not shown above were reported after Day 28 (intended LFU Visit), giving totals of 1.7% 
(11) in the lefamulin group and 1.2% (8) in the moxifloxacin group. The 3 additional deaths in the lefamulin 
group were due to sepsis leading to death on Day 32, endocarditis leading to death on Day 57 and acute 
myeloid leukaemia leading to death on Day 271. No deaths in either group were considered treatment–
related. Deaths occurred within 5 days of the first dose in 5/11 (45%) lefamulin-treated and 3/8 (38%) 
moxifloxacin-treated subjects and 11/19 were in PORT Risk Class IV or V. 
Rates for SAEs were 5.6% in the lefamulin group and 4.8% in the moxifloxacin group. SAEs were most 
commonly reported in the SOC of Infections and Infestations and account for the treatment difference in 
3101 as well as the overall difference. Most of these SAEs represented worsening or complications of CAP and 
none of these events was considered related to study drug. Of the 12 lefamulin-treated subjects with SAEs of 
pneumonia or acute respiratory decline, 6 were non-responders at ECR while 5 were ECR responders but 
failed at TOC. The remaining subject was an ECR responder and a success at TOC, but had an SAE of 
pneumonia starting on day 17 and was considered a relapse at LFU. 
In the lefamulin group, SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment included events 
of liver function test increased, ALT increased and injection site reaction. In the moxifloxacin group, 
treatment-related SAEs were angioedema and acute myocardial infarction.

Laboratory findings 
In Phase 3 trials the most frequently reported haematology laboratory AEs were anaemia (0.5% vs. 0.6%) 
and WBC increased (0.2% vs. 0.5%), none of which led to discontinuation of treatment. The most frequently 
reported chemistry laboratory AEs other than those relating to liver function were hypokalaemia (1.2% 
lefamulin vs. 1.1% moxifloxacin), CK increased (0.5% vs. 0.2%), hyperglycaemia (0.2% vs. 0.5%) and

hypoalbuminaemia (0% vs. 0.5%). In addition to the two lefamulin subjects who discontinued study drug due 
to hepatic AEs, one subject in 3102 discontinued due to an AE of non-serious creatinine clearance decreased, 
which was mild and unrelated. 
The percentages of subjects with PCS haematology and clinical chemistry parameters at any time post-
baseline were slightly higher for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. The overall differences shown below seem to 
mainly reflect higher rates of PCS values in the lefamulin group for increased platelets (3.8% vs. 2.2%), 
increased neutrophils (3.7% vs. 1.8%) and leucocytes (1.6% vs. 1.1%), decreased haemoglobin (1.3% vs. 
0.7%) and increases in potassium (1.2% vs. 0.5%), AST (2.0% vs. 1.2%), ALT (3.5% vs. 3.1%), GGT (3.0% 
vs. 1.3%) and ALP 1.2% vs. 0.5%).

For all subjects in Phase 3 trials with available data, the mean maximum increases from baseline in ALT were 
greater in the lefamulin group (ALT 19.0 U/L vs. 10.8 U/L; AST 10.6 U/L vs. 5.9 U/L; ALP 13.2 U/L vs. 8.5 
U/L). The mean maximum increases from baseline in bilirubin were 1.6 U/L vs. 1.0 U/L. The maximum post-
baseline ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin values relative to the ULN are shown below. In 3101, there was a 
higher percentage in the lefamulin group with ALT >3 x ULN. In 3101 and in 3102, there was a higher 
percentage in the lefamulin group with AST >3 x ULN. Whilst numbers with ALT or AST increases to >5 x or 
10 x ULN were small in both groups, there were slightly more such subjects in the lefamulin group. However, 
elevations in total bilirubin >2 x ULN were the same for the two treatment groups. Across Phase 2 and 3 no 
subjects in the lefamulin group and 1 subject in the moxifloxacin group met the laboratory criteria for 
potential Hy’s Law (see the eDISH plot below).

For changes in ALT over time for Phase 3 lefamulin subjects with increases to ALT >5 x ULN, peak ALT 
typically occurred within the first week after the first dose and declined to within or near normal levels by the 
LFU Visit. This pattern contrasted with that for moxifloxacin subjects with values >5xULN, where the timing 
of the peak value was much more variable.

Figure 12. ALT Values Over Time for Subjects with Values >5 x ULN in Pool 3 (Safety Analysis Set) 
The dossier included a Liver Safety Analysis Report prepared by an external expert in which 3 cases are 
discussed. One lefamulin patient was reported to have drug-related chronic hepatitis but this does not seem 
to have actually been the case. One was reported to have toxic hepatitis with onset on day 4 of increased ALT 
(max 4.9xULN) and AST (max 6.3xULN) considered to be drug-related leading to discontinuation of 
treatment. The abnormalities had resolved by day 22. A third lefamulin subject was reported to have hypoxic 
hepatopathy starting on treatment with day 4 values of ALT 9xULN and AST >10xULN, at which time he was 
not hypoxic. He remained on treatment and next day the values had fallen to below 5xULN with resolution 
documented on day 27. He was considered a treatment success on day 5. The report investigated laboratory 
abnormalities by demographics but no firm conclusions could be drawn. However, subjects with baseline AST 
or ALT > ULN were more likely to have on-treatment increases regardless of treatment group. The shift 
analysis reached a similar conclusion.

Enzymes 
The report also discusses individual cases with outlying post-baseline ALT values: 
• 
• 
In Phase 2 there were two such lefamulin subjects. One had an increase to ALT 7.2xULN and AST 
8.6xULN plus an elevated GGT on the last day of treatment (day 6) and normal values on day 9. The 
other had slight baseline abnormalities and on day 15 (1-day post-treatment) had ALT 6.4xULN and 
AST 3.7xULN that substantially decreased by day 22.  
In Phase 3 there was one subject in 3101 with ALT>10xULN on day 8 (1-day post-treatment) but 
AST was only 1.5xULN and there were substantial decreases by day 13. Subjects with such values in 
3102 included the case described above with hypoxic hepatopathy, a case with day 5 (EOT) ALT 
9.3xULN and AST 6.6xULN as well as raised GGT and ALP, all of which decreased thereafter, and a 
case with day 5 (EOT) ALT>10xULN and AST 5.6xULN as well as raised GGT and ALP, all of which 
decreased thereafter.  
From the R-value analysis of cases of ALT elevation, the following patterns were observed for lefamulin.

Table 68. Hepatotoxicity Injury Patterns (Categorised by R-values) for Lefamulin-treated Subjects 
with CTCAE Grade 2 or Higher ALT in Phase 3 Studies 
The report summarises the overall picture for lefamulin as follows: 
•  Rapid onset (within 4-5 days) after oral or IV dosing with lefamulin 
• 
• 
Peak values around Day 5-8 (at completion of dosing) or by Day 15 
Predominantly hepatocellular (50.0%) or mixed injury (40.0%) pattern  
•  ALT/AST usually <10 x ULN; ALP <5 x ULN 
•  ALT generally higher than AST (in the absence of muscle injury or alcohol use) 
•  Bilirubin remained normal (or <2 x ULN) 
• 
• 
The mechanism for potential hepatotoxicity is undefined but the very short latency (days) suggests a 
form of direct hepatotoxicity in a susceptible patient 
The low incidence argues against intrinsic (predictable) hepatotoxicity 
•  Subjects were asymptomatic, with no hypersensitivity features 
• 
• 
• 
The aminotransferase time course indicated reversible injury (within 2-4 weeks) with no development 
of chronic injury 
There was no major difference in ALT >3 x ULN and >200% increase from baseline vs. comparator in 
the Phase 3 studies (3101: 5.0% lefamulin vs. 3.7% moxifloxacin; 3102: 2.4% vs. 2.7%; pooled: 
3.5% vs.3.1% 
There were no Hy’s Law cases for lefamulin and no cases of acute liver failure 
Additional analyses were requested. The table below shows baseline characteristics, medication use and 
safety data for Phase 3 patient subgroups with and without elevated baseline liver enzymes. Medication use 
revealed that the rate of systemic antibacterial use within 72 hours before randomisation was higher in 
lefamulin patients with elevated ALT or AST at baseline (29.4%) compared to those with normal ALT and AST

at baseline (21.3%). During the study, concomitant systemic antibacterial use was approximately twice as 
high in those with elevated ALT or AST at baseline compared to those without such elevation (23.5% vs. 
12.8%, respectively). A similar pattern was observed in the moxifloxacin group.

The data suggested that: 
o  Patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes had more severe underlying disease (in aspects not 
captured by PORT Risk Class alone) so were more likely to experience TEAEs that were not related to 
study drug but due to underlying conditions. 
o  The greater extent of on-study liver enzyme elevations in this subgroup may have been related to 
underlying disease complications and/or the greater use of non-study antibacterial medications that 
carry their own risk of transaminitis. 
While the overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in those with vs. without elevated baseline liver enzymes 
(42.0% vs. 33.3% for lefamulin and 38.2% vs. 28.2% for moxifloxacin), the incidence of TEAEs considered 
related to study drug was essentially the same for lefamulin (14.3% vs.15.7%) and only slightly higher for 
moxifloxacin (13.2% vs. 9.9%).  
For lefamulin, half of the increase in the overall incidence of TEAEs in the subgroup with elevated baseline 
liver enzymes was caused by events in the SOC of Infections and infestations (e.g. HIV infection, pneumonia, 
sinusitis and hepatitis C), all of which were considered not related to study drug. 
Among the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC, only in the SOC of General disorders and administration 
site conditions were the related TEAEs notably more frequent in the subgroup with elevated baseline liver 
enzymes (4.2% vs. 2.5%) and most were administration site reactions. The overall incidence of serious 
TEAEs was slightly higher in those with elevated baseline liver enzymes compared to those without such 
elevation (7.6% vs 5.2% for lefamulin) but this was also the case for the moxifloxacin group. 
Patients in both treatment groups with elevated ALT or AST at baseline were much more likely to have post-
baseline elevations >3 x ULN as compared to those with normal ALT and AST at baseline. The distribution of 
baseline values and the highest (“worst”) post-baseline values for ALT and AST are shown in the figures 
below by subgroup.

Since the group with elevated baseline liver enzymes was defined by having either an elevated ALT or AST at 
baseline, the figures show a broad distribution of values for each parameter at baseline. The figures show 
that while more patients with pre-existing elevations shifted into the >3 x ULN stratum, few values were >5 
x ULN, with a comparable pattern observed for the moxifloxacin group.

Immunological events 
In Phase 3 trials, AEs of rashes, pruritus and other potential manifestations of hypersensitivity were reported 
for 3 (0.5%) in the lefamulin group vs. 14 (2.2%) in the moxifloxacin group. One lefamulin subject (0.2%) 
experienced a non-serious rash of mild severity, which was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to 
study drug. The rash resolved the same day with treatment, and no action was taken.  
Two other lefamulin subjects (0.3%) experienced non-serious AEs of bronchospasm, one of which was severe 
starting on day 2 while the other was of moderate severity starting on day 7 and was considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to study drug. Neither subject had a medical history of COPD or asthma. 
Both events resolved with treatment and no action was taken with study drug in either case. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is a potential for a pharmacodynamic (additive) effect to occur if lefamulin is given with other agents 
that can affect cardiac conduction. In Phase 3 trials patients were excluded if they had received within 7 days 
before enrolment any Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic agent (Class Ia: quinidine, procainamide, 
disopyramide; Class III: amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol) or any other medication with potential to 
prolong the QT interval. There is also a PK interaction risk, that could lead to increased or decreased 
lefamulin concentrations, affecting safety or efficacy, respectively. In Phase 3 trials patients taking a strong 
P-gp inhibitor or a strong CYP3A inducer or inhibitor were excluded.

Safety related to age 
Table 70. Overall Summary of Adverse Events by Age Group for Pool 3 (Safety Analysis Set) 
In Pool 3, 59.8% of subjects were 18-64 years old, 23.2% were 65-74 years old, 13.7% were 75-84 years 
old, and 3.4% of subjects were ≥85 years old. The rates of severe TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading 
to death were higher among older subjects (75-84 years and ≥85 years) compared with younger subjects 
(18-64 years and 65-74 years) in both treatment groups. The rates of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug were similar among older and younger subjects in the lefamulin group, and were higher among 
older subjects compared with younger subjects in the moxifloxacin group. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs (≥2% in either treatment group) in subjects 65-74 years old were diarrhoea (5.9% lefamulin and 
2.1% moxifloxacin) and nausea (2.0% and 3.4%). The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥2% in either 
treatment group) in subjects 75-84 years old were atrial fibrillation (2.2% lefamulin and 2.3% moxifloxacin), 
diarrhoea (5.6% and 4.7%), nausea (2.2% and 1.2%) and vomiting (4.5% and 0). The most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥2 subjects in either treatment group) in subjects ≥85 years old were nausea (2 lefamulin 
subjects and 0 moxifloxacin subjects) and urinary tract infection (1 lefamulin subject and 2 moxifloxacin 
subjects). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Phase 3 trials AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 3.1% lefamulin and 3.3% 
moxifloxacin subjects. Most frequent were AEs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations (0.6% and 0.9% in 
Assessment report

respective groups). AEs by PTs reported for more than 1 lefamulin subject were ECG QT prolonged (2 [0.3%] 
lefamulin and 3 [0.5%] moxifloxacin-treated subjects) and vomiting (2 vs. 1 subjects). AEs in the SOC of 
Gastrointestinal Disorders led to study drug discontinuation in 3 lefamulin (2 with vomiting and 1 with 
abdominal pain upper) and 1 moxifloxacin-treated subject (vomiting). One subject in the lefamulin group 
discontinued due to infusion site phlebitis, and 1 subject in the moxifloxacin group discontinued due to 
infusion site erythema. 
Seven lefamulin and 8 moxifloxacin subjects had TEAEs leading to discontinuation that were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study drug. In the lefamulin group, these included: vomiting and ECG QT 
prolonged (each reported in 2 subjects), hepatitis toxic, infusion site phlebitis and bradycardia. In the 
moxifloxacin group, these included: urticaria and ECG QT prolonged (each reported in 2 subjects); infusion 
site erythema, confusional state, and angioedema (each reported in 1 subject); and dizziness and 
palpitations (reported in 1 subject). 
Post-marketing experience 
None. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events 
With two pivotal studies completed plus a comprehensive Phase 1 programme and a Phase 2 trial in ABSSSI, 
the safety database is larger than is often seen with new antibacterial agents. In Phase 3 trials the 
proportions reporting AEs (about one third) was lower than is often observed.  
In 3101 the total rates were very comparable between treatments. The mode of intravenous administration 
was amended during development to reflect the finding that dilution in citrate buffered saline reduced local 
pain. In addition, a 1-h infusion time was adopted. In 3101 IV, using these recommended infusion conditions, 
lefamulin was more likely to be associated with local intolerance than IV moxifloxacin but the rates were 
acceptably low and few cases were severe.  
In 3102, lefamulin was associated with higher AE (all and related) rates and very slightly higher rates for 
severe AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation. It seems that this difference reflects poor gastrointestinal 
tolerance of oral lefamulin compared to oral moxifloxacin. The between-treatment differences in rates of 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea also drove the observed higher rates of drug-related AEs with lefamulin in 
3102. 
Despite the relatively modest spectrum of activity of lefamulin, a risk for C. difficile enterocolitis exists. 
The rates for hypersensitivity reactions to lefamulin have been low. Thus far, it does not appear that 
lefamulin has a particular propensity for toxic effects on the bone marrow. 
Effect on QTc interval 
In Phase 3 trials, in which other drugs known to prolong QTc were not to be co-administered, AEs mapping to 
the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported with IV (2.9% lefamulin vs. 4% moxifloxacin) and oral treatments 
Assessment report

Page 154/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2.2% vs. 2.4%). AEs of QT prolongation were reported for 4 (0.6%) in the lefamulin group (2 discontinued) 
and 5 (0.8%) in the moxifloxacin group (3 discontinued). The maximum changes at any time post-baseline 
were 16.8 msec for lefamulin vs. 19.3 msec for moxifloxacin and maximum individual changes were 87.7 
msec vs. 98.7 msec. With IV dosing the mean change from baseline in QTcF was 13.8 msec vs. 16.4 msec 
and oral dosing gave changes of 9.5 msec vs. 11.6 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec (17.9% vs. 
22.3%) and >60 msec (1.7% vs. 2.5%) were observed. ECGs following IV dosing showed that QT outliers 
occurred at rates of 4.8% vs. 4.4% for QTcF > 480 msec and 2.6% vs. 3.3% for change in QTcF > 60 msec. 
In comparison 1.1% of lefamulin subjects had a post-baseline QTcF increase of >60 msec with oral dosing. 
In conclusion, the effect of lefamulin on the QTc interval is very similar to that of moxifloxacin. Although the 
risk of arrhythmias cannot be deduced from this comparison, the contraindications in the moxifloxacin SmPC 
have been applied to lefamulin.  
Hepatic effects 
In pooled Phase 3 trials, the rates for hepatic AEs were very similar between the two treatment groups. 
Potentially clinically significant increases in AST, ALT, GGT and ALP occurred more often in the lefamulin 
group and the mean maximum increases in these parameters, as well as bilirubin, were all greater for 
lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. Numbers with increases to >5x or 10x ULN were small in both groups but there 
were slightly more such subjects in the lefamulin group. However, elevations in total bilirubin >2 x ULN were 
the same for the two treatment groups. 
Despite these differences, across Phase 2 and 3 no subjects in the lefamulin group and 1 subject in the 
moxifloxacin group met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law. Changes over time indicated that the 
peak ALT in lefamulin subjects tended to occur within 7 days of starting treatment and declined post-
treatment. There was some indication that those with baseline elevated transaminases were more at risk of 
additional on-treatment increases. 
In addition, differences in the incidences of all AEs were observed for subjects with elevated baseline liver 
enzymes compared with subjects with normal baseline liver enzymes (lefamulin: 42.0% vs. 33.3%, 
moxifloxacin: 38.2% vs. 28.2%). Similarly, incidences of severe AEs were lefamulin 5.9% vs. 3.8% and 
moxifloxacin 5.6% vs. vs 3.0% and rates for SAEs were lefamulin 7.6% vs. 5.2% and moxifloxacin 8.3% vs. 
3.8%.  
Since there is no human experience with administration of systemic pleuromutilins, there are no potentially 
relevant data that might assist in assessing the risk that the hepatic enzyme abnormalities may translate into 
serious hepatotoxicity. The actual risk of serious hepatotoxicity occurring cannot be predicted solely by 
comparing the rates for hepatic enzyme abnormalities. 
SAEs and deaths 
Although none of the deaths was considered treatment-related, several of the deaths as well as non-fatal 
SAEs were apparently related to failure of treatment and it appears that worsening of CAP accounted for the 
higher rate of SAEs in the lefamulin group in 3101.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
It is concluded that the effects of lefamulin on QTc and on transaminases are not distinguishable from those 
of moxifloxacin. However, that does not mean that the risk of severe hepatic toxicity and life-threatening 
arrhythmias will be the same. Post-marketing data will have to address these questions. 
The other features of the lefamulin safety profile do not raise issues that would preclude authorisation.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 19.08.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of lefamulin with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers lefamulin to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Xenleta (lefamulin) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Xenleta is intended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. 
Populations at risk for CAP include the elderly, patients who smoke, suffer from alcoholism, patients with 
underlying comorbidities (such as COPD, chronic heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and having a history of 
cerebrovascular disease/stroke) and those with recent hospital, healthcare or nursing home exposure. Given 
the increasing numbers of older patients hospitalised in the EU with CAP, it is expected that the burden of 
CAP will increase.  
Approximately 3,370,000 cases of pneumonia occur annually in the EU. The incidence of all-cause pneumonia 
in the EU ranged from 68-7000 per 100,000 persons but this varied by country, age, group, study and time-
period. The incidence in hospitalised CAP of all causes ranged from 16-3581 per 100,000 persons and the 
incidence increased consistently with age within the EU. In Finland, the incidence of CAP increased six-fold 
when comparing patients aged 30-44 years and those aged >75 years. The mortality rate for CAP was 9.1%, 
with ranges varying widely from <1% to as high as 48%, especially when patients with CAP are treated in 
the intensive care unit. A long-term follow-up study found that elderly patients treated for CAP in both 
ambulatory and hospital settings had significantly higher risks of death and death related to pneumonia and 
cardiovascular conditions for several years following a diagnosis of pneumonia than the elderly without 
pneumonia. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In 2011, a collaboration between the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and The European Society for 
Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published updated European guidelines for the 
treatment of CAP. The recommendation for outpatients was use of either amoxicillin or tetracycline as 
monotherapy, and for patients with hypersensitivity to amoxicillin, a tetracycline or macrolide should be 
prescribed; however, regional, macrolide resistance rates to S. pneumoniae need to be considered. When 
resistance rates are clinically relevant, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) can be 
used. 
For hospitalised patients not considered severe, penicillin G ± macrolide, an aminopenicillin (amoxicillin) ± 
macrolide, an aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ± macrolide), a non-
antipseudomonal, third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone ± macrolide or a 
respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) can be given. The ERS/ESCMID guidelines suggest 
that combination therapy should be restricted to patients with severe presentation of CAP, with combination 
therapy being the treatment of choice for patients with severe CAP being treated in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). 
Assessment report  
EMA/325848/2020 
Page 158/165  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae is at least 15% in the European Union (EU) and the US and is 
approaching 100% in Asia. Increased rates of resistance have also been reported for fluoroquinolones, 
another commonly prescribed antibiotic therapy for CAP. Although the IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend 
initiating treatment of CAP with macrolides, if local pneumococcal resistance is less than 25%, resistance 
among S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae isolates to this class has been increasingly reported worldwide. 
Approximately 50% of S. pneumoniae strains are resistant to macrolides in the US with rates varying 
significantly by geographic region. 
Although there is increasing resistance in common CAP pathogens, at the present time there remain several 
options available such that it is very rare, especially in the EU, that patients are left with only one or two 
predicted active agents. Thus, although new agents to treat CAP, including strains resistant to commonly 
used antibacterial agents, would be welcomed, it is not perceived that there is a major unmet need in this 
regard. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the claimed indication for treatment of CAP, the applicant conducted two randomised, double-
blind and active-controlled Phase 3 trials to evaluate use of IV/PO lefamulin in patients with CAP and PORT 
scores III-V (3101) and PO lefamulin in patients with CAP with PORT scores II-IV (3102). Both trials aimed to 
demonstrate non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. IV/PO or PO moxifloxacin as the comparative agent based on 
the clinical outcome at the test of cure (TOC visit) with a 10% non-inferiority margin. This programme 
complies with the existing and draft revised CHMP guidance on the development of antibacterial agents. In 
compliance with existing guidance, the mITT and CE populations were considered co-primary. Moxifloxacin 
(IV and PO) was a suitable comparator and allowed a double-blind design for both trials as well as permitting 
a switch from IV to PO in 3101. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Both trials demonstrated non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin in the primary analyses based on 
clinical outcomes at TOC in the mITT populations. It is acceptable that the primary analyses were conducted 
in the mITT (all-treated) population since there was very little difference in numbers vs. the ITT population, 
which is the recommended primary analysis population in the revised guidance. The non-inferiority criterion 
was also met in the CE population (87% of total) in both trials. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Both trials showed that lefamulin was consistently numerically inferior to moxifloxacin for clinical and 
microbiological success rates at TOC across the pre-defined trial populations.  
Lefamulin was numerically inferior to moxifloxacin in several large subgroups, including age < 65 years and 
ATS severe category patients, and this consistently across trials. After further investigations, no clear 
explanation could be found for the observed imbalances.

In line with the primary analyses, the clinical success rates at TOC in the microITT (58% of total enrolled in 
3101 and 53% in 3102) and microITT2 (32% of total enrolled in 3101 and 31% in 3102) populations were 
consistently numerically lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. Furthermore, in the microITT-2 populations, 
clinical success rates at TOC for S. pneumoniae were 81% for lefamulin vs. 86.4% for moxifloxacin (34/42 
vs. 38/44) in 3101 and 80% vs. 94.6% (36/45 vs. 53/56) in 3102. 
In addition, the clinical success rates for PSSP were lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin (in 3101 71.4% vs. 
94.4% [n = 15/21, of which 5/6 failures had PSSP in blood, and 17/18]; in 3102 76.9% vs. 100% [n=20/26 
and 38/38]). In 3102, 3 of the 6 PSSP failures in the lefamulin group received only one day of treatment but 
the other three were clearly all treatment failures. 
Moreover, clinical response rates at TOC by S. pneumoniae serotypes (only possible to determine in the 
microITT-2 subset with a positive culture) were consistently lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. Across the 
two trials the rates were 50/62 for lefamulin (80.6%) vs. 65/69 (94.2%) for moxifloxacin and the LFU rates 
were 79% vs. 94.2%.  
Underlining the concerns, 7 lefamulin patients in 3101 had baseline bacteraemia of which 6 had S. 
pneumoniae and one had S. aureus (but had S. pneumoniae in sputum culture). The success rate was only 
1/7 (14.3%), with 5/6 with S. pneumoniae in blood and the other patient with a positive sputum culture 
failing. One patient with S. pneumoniae in blood died from uncontrolled infection. In 3102, 6 lefamulin 
patients had bacteraemia, of which 3 were S. pneumoniae and 2/3 failed although none died. In both trials, 
success rates in bacteraemic patients treated with moxifloxacin (2/3 in 3101 and 7/9 in 3102) were higher 
than for lefamulin although numbers are very small. 
To investigate further, the applicant provided analyses of efficacy confined to patients with evidence of a 
pathogen based solely on positive sputum or blood culture, positive urinary antigen for S. pneumoniae or L. 
pneumophila or positive serology for pathogens associated with atypical pneumonia.  
After excluding all other patients, the cure rates in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were numerically 
lower for lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin (28/36 [77.8%] vs. 26/31 [83.9%] when treatment commenced 
intravenously and 19/25 (76%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%) when treatment commenced orally. Furthermore, among 
patients with positive cultures and lefamulin MICs for S. pneumoniae, the cure rates in patients treated with 
lefamulin were 9/10 (90%), 34/41 (83%) and 6/9 (67%) when MICs of lefamulin were 0.12, 0.25 and 0.5 
mg/L, respectively.  
Concerns over the observed efficacy of lefamulin against S. pneumoniae are not helped by the PK-PD 
analyses. When the POPPK model was updated using Phase 3 PK data, PTA was re-estimated against the 
PDTs derived from murine lung and thigh models. Results suggested that the IV and oral (when taken on an 
empty stomach) regimens were not sufficient to cover pneumococci with MICs at the upper end of the 
distribution curve.  
In 3101 the mean and median duration of total treatment was 7 days and the duration of IV was near to 6 
days in both treatment groups. Whilst 75% of the total was enrolled after the amendment to increase the 
standard duration of lefamulin from 5 to 7 days, the cure rates at TOC were lower for lefamulin in those 
enrolled prior (5 days) or after (7 days) the amendment. Therefore, for patients who need to start with IV 
treatment, a total duration of 7 days is recommended.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
With two pivotal studies completed plus a comprehensive Phase 1 programme and a Phase 2 trial in ABSSSI, 
the safety database is larger than is often seen with new antibacterial agents. It is notable that in Phase 3 
trials the proportions reporting AEs (about one third) was lower than is often observed. Nevertheless, the 
sponsor conducted several audits and there have site inspections by FDA and there is no clear reason to be 
concerned about adequacy of reporting.  
In 3101 the total rates for AEs were very comparable between treatments. The mode of intravenous 
administration was amended during development when it was found that dilution in citrate buffered saline 
reduced local pain. In addition, a 1-h infusion time was adopted. In 3101, using these recommended infusion 
conditions, IV lefamulin was more likely to be associated with local intolerance than IV moxifloxacin but the 
rates were acceptably low and few cases were severe.  
In 3102, lefamulin was associated with higher AE (all and related) rates and very slightly higher rates for 
severe AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation. It seems that this difference reflects poor gastrointestinal 
tolerance of oral lefamulin compared to oral moxifloxacin. The between-treatment differences in rates of 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea also drove the observed higher rates of drug-related AEs with lefamulin in 
3102. 
The rates for hypersensitivity reactions to lefamulin have been low. Despite the relatively modest spectrum of 
activity of lefamulin, a risk for C. difficile enterocolitis exists. Thus far, it does not appear that lefamulin has a 
particular propensity for toxic effects on the bone marrow. 
The clinical effect of lefamulin on the QTc interval was apparent in the first Phase 1 studies.  
In Phase 3 trials, in which other drugs known to prolong QTc were not to be co-administered, AEs mapping to 
the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported with IV (2.9% lefamulin vs. 4% moxifloxacin) and oral treatments 
(2.2% vs. 2.4%). AEs of QT prolongation were reported for 4 (0.6%) in the lefamulin group (2 discontinued) 
and 5 (0.8%) in the moxifloxacin group.  
The maximum changes at any time post-baseline were 16.8 msec for lefamulin vs. 19.3 msec for 
moxifloxacin and maximum individual changes were 87.7 msec vs. 98.7 msec. With IV dosing the mean 
change from baseline in QTcF was 13.8 msec vs. 16.4 msec and oral dosing gave changes of 9.5 msec vs. 
11.6 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec (17.9% vs. 22.3%) and >60 msec (1.7% vs. 2.5%) were 
observed. ECGs following IV dosing showed that QT outliers occurred at rates of 4.4% vs. 2.9% for QTcF > 
480 msec and 2.6% vs. 3.3% for change in QTcF > 60 msec. In comparison 1.1% of lefamulin subjects had a 
post-baseline QTcF increase of >60 msec with oral dosing. 
In pooled Phase 3 trials, the rates for hepatic AEs were very similar between the two treatment groups. 
Potentially clinically significant increases in AST, ALT, GGT and ALP occurred more often in the lefamulin 
group and the mean maximum increases in these parameters, as well as bilirubin, were all greater for 
lefamulin vs. moxifloxacin. Numbers with increases to >5x or 10x ULN were small in both groups but there 
were slightly more such subjects in the lefamulin group. However, elevations in total bilirubin >2 x ULN were 
the same for the two treatment groups and no subjects in the lefamulin group vs. 1 subject in the 
moxifloxacin group met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law. Changes over time indicated that the 
peak ALT in lefamulin subjects tended to occur within 7 days of starting treatment and declined post-

treatment. There was some indication that those with baseline elevated transaminases were more at risk of 
additional on-treatment increases and had higher AE reporting rates vs. those with normal levels at baseline. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Whilst lefamulin is associated with rates for QTc prolongation and elevated transaminases that are very 
similar to those for moxifloxacin, it cannot be predicted from such data whether lefamulin will also have 
similar risks for serious arrhythmias or hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, since there is no other pleuromutilin 
licensed for systemic administration to man, there are no relevant class effect data available to take into 
account.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant conducted two pivotal trials in CAP, both of which showed non-inferiority for lefamulin vs. 
moxifloxacin. Nevertheless, the most important pathogen to cover is S. pneumoniae. Taking into account also 
the concerns regarding the PK-PD analyses, there is concern regarding the ability of lefamulin when used at 
the recommended doses to treat S. pneumoniae and the indication has been restricted. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance is considered to be favourable.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Xenleta is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Xenleta is favourable in the following indication: 
Xenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is 
considered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial 
treatment of CAP or when these have failed (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 
4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lefamulin is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

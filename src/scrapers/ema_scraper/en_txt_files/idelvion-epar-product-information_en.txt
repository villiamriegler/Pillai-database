QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
IDELVION 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with 
albumin (rIX-FP), (albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections the 
solution contains 100 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa.
IDELVION 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 500 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with 
albumin (rIX-FP), (albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections the 
solution contains 200 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa.
IDELVION 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 1000 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with 
albumin (rIX-FP), (albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections the 
solution contains 400 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa.
IDELVION 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 2000 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with 
albumin (rIX-FP), (albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 5 ml water for injections the 
solution contains 400 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa.
IDELVION 3500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 3500 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with 
albumin (rIX-FP), (albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 5 ml water for injections the
solution contains 700 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopeia one stage clotting test. The specific 
activity of IDELVION is approximately 54 – 85 IU/mg protein.
Albutrepenonacog alfa is a purified protein produced by recombinant DNA technology, generated by 
the genetic fusion of recombinant albumin to recombinant coagulation factor IX. The genetic fusion of 
the cDNA of human albumin to the cDNA of human coagulation factor IX enables the protein to be 
produced as a single recombinant protein and assures product homogeneity by avoiding chemical 
conjugation. The recombinant factor IX portion is identical to the Thr148 allelic form of plasma-
derived factor IX. The cleavable linker between the recombinant factor IX and albumin molecules is 
derived from the endogenous “activation peptide” in native factor IX.
Excipient with known effect
Each reconstituted 250 IU, 500 IU or 1000 IU vial contains 4.3 mg of sodium.
Each reconstituted 2000 IU or 3500 IU vial contains 8.6 mg of sodium (see section 4.4).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX 
deficiency).
IDELVION can be used for all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia
B.
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
responses to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor IX activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Measurement 
with a one-stage clotting assay using a kaolin based aPTT reagent or Actin FS aPTT reagent will likely 
result in an underestimation of activity level. This is of importance particularly when changing the 
laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.
Posology
Dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on the 
location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.
3
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed 
either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of 
normal human plasma.
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor IX 
per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by an average of 1.3 IU/dl (1.3 % of normal
activity) in patients ≥ 12 years of age and by 1.0 IU/dl (1.0 % of normal activity) in patients < 12 years 
of age. The required dose is determined using the following formulae:
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (% of normal or IU/dl) x {reciprocal of 
observed recovery (IU/kg per IU/dl)}
Expected factor IX rise (IU/dl or % of normal) = Dose (IU) x Recovery (IU/dl per IU/kg)/body weight 
(kg)
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Patients < 12 years of age
For an incremental recovery of 1 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (IU/dl) x 1 dl/kg
Example 
1.
A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 20 kg patient with severe haemophilia B. The 
appropriate dose would be 20 kg x 50 IU/dl x 1 dl/kg = 1000 IUs.
2.
A dose of 1000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 25 kg patient, should be expected to result 
in a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 1000 IUs/25 kg x 1.0 (IU/dl per IU/kg) = 40 IU/dl 
(40 % of normal).
Patients ≥ 12 years of age
For an incremental recovery of 1.3 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: 
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (IU/dl) x 0.77 dl/kg
Example 
3.
A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 80 kg patient with severe haemophilia B.  The 
appropriate dose would be 80 kg x 50 IU/dl x 0.77 dl/kg = 3080 IUs.
4.
A dose of 2000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 80 kg patient, should be expected to result 
in a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 2000 IUs x 1.3 (IU/dl per IU/kg) 
/80 kg = 32.5 IU/dl (32.5 % of normal).
4
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or in IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Minor or moderate haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding (except iliopsoas) 
or oral bleeding 
Major haemorrhage

(pre- and postoperative)
Frequency of doses (hours) 
/ Duration of therapy (days) 
Single dose should be 
sufficient for majority of 
bleeds. Maintenance dose 
after 24 – 72 hours if there is 
further evidence of bleeding. 
Repeat every 24 – 72 hours 
for the first week, and then 
maintenance dose weekly 
until bleeding stops and 
healing is achieved.
Single dose may be sufficient 
for a majority of minor 
surgeries. If needed, 
maintenance dose can be 
provided after 24 – 72 hours 
until bleeding stops and 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat every 24 – 72 hours 
for the first week, and then 
maintenance dose 1 – 2 times 
per week until bleeding stops 
and healing is achieved.
Prophylaxis 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses are
35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly.
Some patients who are well-controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg 
on an interval of 10 or 14 days. For patients >18 years, further extension of the treatment interval may 
be considered (see section 5.1).
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
After a bleeding episode during prophylaxis, patients should maintain their prophylaxis regimen as 
closely as possible, with 2 doses of IDELVION being administered at least 24 hours apart, but longer 
if deemed suitable for the patient.
Paediatric population 
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose regimen is 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2). For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the 
same as for adults (see above).
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
The reconstituted preparation should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate comfortable for the 
patient up to a maximum of 5 ml/min.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Known allergic reaction to hamster protein.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with IDELVION. The product contains traces of 
hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use
of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the 
early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
After repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for 
the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units 
(BU) using appropriate biological testing. Formation of inhibitor to factor IX has been reported during 
factor replacement therapy with IDELVION in the treatment of haemophilia B.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated 
for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. 
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administration of factor IX 
should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical observation 
where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Thromboembolism 
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of 
thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when 
administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born 
infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit 
of treatment with IDELVION should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
Cardiovascular events
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the 
cardiovascular risk.
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Elderly
Clinical studies of IDELVION did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. 
Immune tolerance induction
The safety and efficacy of using IDELVION for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
6
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains up to 8.6 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.4% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Based on the rare occurrence of 
haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-
feeding is not available. 
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
There is no information on the effects of factor IX on fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
IDELVION has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these 
reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association 
with development of factor IX inhibitors (see also section 4.4). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported 
following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors 
and a history of allergic reaction. 
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has 
been observed.
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such 
inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it 
is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. One case with high-titre inhibitor 
was reported in the clinical study which evaluated previously untreated patients. Inhibitor development 
has been observed in previously treated patients in the post-marketing experience with IDELVION.
There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX 
products, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has 
been associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with 
such adverse reactions.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level). The table lists adverse reactions that were reported in clinical trials and/or were

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX, ATC code: B02BD04.
Mechanism of action
Factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin-
K dependent coagulation factor and it is synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in 
the intrinsic coagulation pathway and by the factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. 
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X 
converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is
8
formed. Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased 
levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels 
of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and 
correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Of note, ABR (annualized bleeding rate) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies.
Albutrepenonacog alfa is a recombinant coagulation factor IX. Prolongation of the half-life of 
albutrepenonacog alfa and the enhanced systemic exposure (see section 5.2) are achieved by fusion 
with recombinant albumin. Albumin is a natural, inert carrier protein in plasma with a half-life of 
approximately 20 days.
Albutrepenonacog alfa remains intact in the circulation until factor IX is activated, whereupon albumin 
is cleaved, releasing activated factor IX (FIXa) when it is needed for coagulation. 
General information on clinical efficacy and safety
A phase 1/2 study evaluated the treatment efficacy and prevention of bleeding episodes of rIX-FP 
in 17 subjects (ages 13-46 years), 13 subjects in the prophylaxis arm received weekly prophylaxis 
with IDELVION for approximately 11 months, and 4 subjects in the on-demand arm received 
IDELVION upon occurrence of bleeding events. All 85 bleeding episodes were successfully 
treated with 1 or 2 doses of IDELVION.
The efficacy of IDELVION has been evaluated in the open-label, uncontrolled part of a phase 2/3 
study, in which a total of 63 male, previously treated patients (PTPs) between 12 and 61 years of 
age received IDELVION either for prophylaxis once every 7-, 10- and/or 14-day intervals and/or 
for the treatment of bleeding episodes on an on-demand basis. All subjects had severe (FIX level 
<1%) or moderately severe (FIX level ≤ 2%) haemophilia B. Forty PTPs received IDELVION for 
prophylaxis.
Subjects who received prophylactic treatment started with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A subgroup 
of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a recommended 
dose of 75 IU/kg and individual adjustments. 21 PTPs remained on the extended 14-day 
prophylaxis interval for additional treatment duration of 98 to 575 (median 386) days. From those 
subjects, 8 (38%) experienced at least one bleeding during the 14 day-prophylaxis, while they had 
no bleeding events during once-weekly prophylaxis. Median Annualised Bleeding Rate (ABR) on 
7-day prophylaxis with IDELVION for all bleeds was 0.0 (range 0-6) and on 14 day-prophylaxis 
it was 1.08 (range 0-9.1).
The long-term efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis treatment was confirmed in an open-label 
extension study for up to 5 years. In this study, a total of 59 PTPs ≥12 years (54 adults and 5 
adolescents) received IDELVION either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of bleeding episodes 
on an on-demand basis. Patients who received prophylactic treatment continued or started with 35-50 
IU/kg once weekly. A subgroup of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10, 14 or 
21 days) with a recommended dose of 75 IU/kg (10 or 14 days) or 100 IU/kg (21 days). At the end of 
the study 14 PTPs (24%) were on the 7-day prophylaxis interval, and a total of 11 (19%), 25 (42%) 
and 9 (15%) PTPs remained on the extended prophylaxis interval of 10, 14 and 21 days, respectively. 
During the study, 2 PTPs (18%) in the 21-day regimen switched back to a more frequent dosing due to 
increased bleeding complications. The estimated median Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABRs) on 7-, 
14-, and 21-day prophylaxis with IDELVION for all bleeds were 1.3 (range 0-8), 0.9 (range 0-13), and 
0.3 (range 0-5), respectively.
Currently available information support extension of treatment intervals for some patients though 
potentially associated with an increased risk for bleeding compared to a once-weekly regimen. 
9
Prophylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs below 12 years
The efficacy of IDELVION has been evaluated in a phase 3 study, in which a total of 27 male 
PTPs between 1 and 10 years (median age 6.0 years) with 12 patients < 6 years, received 
IDELVION for prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. All 27 subjects received weekly 
prophylaxis treatment with IDELVION for a mean time on study of 13.1 months (9, 18 months).
Of the 106 bleeding episodes, the majority (94; 88.7%) was treated with single injection, 103; 
97.2% were treated with 1-2 injections. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of a bleed was rated 
excellent or good in 96% of all treated bleeding episodes.
The long-term efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis treatment was confirmed in an open-
label extension study for up to 5 years. In the study, a total of 24 PTPs < 12 years received 
IDELVION either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of bleeding episodes on an on-demand 
basis. Patients who received prophylactic treatment continued with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A 
subgroup of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a 
recommended dose of 75 IU/kg. At the end of the study 17 PTPs (71%) were on the 7 day 
prophylaxis interval, and a total of 3 (12%), and 4 (17%) PTPs remained on the extended 
prophylaxis interval of 10 and 14 days, respectively. During the study, 4 PTPs (50%) in the 14-
day regimen switched back to a more frequent dosing due to increased bleeding complications. 
The estimated median Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABRs) for 7-, and 14-day prophylaxis with 
IDELVION for all bleeds were 2.0 (range 0-14), and 5.6 (range 0-8), respectively.
Perioperative management:
The safety and efficacy in the perioperative setting was evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 studies 
and a long-term extension study. The per protocol efficacy analysis includes 30 surgeries 
performed in 21 patients between 5 and 58 years undergoing major or minor surgical, dental or 
other surgical invasive procedures. Dosing was individualized based on the subject’s PK and 
clinical response to treatment. A single preoperative bolus ranging from 14 to 163 IU/kg was used 
in 96.7% (n=29) of surgeries. Haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good in all of the 
assessed procedures. During the 14-day postoperative period, patients received between 0 and 11 
infusions and total doses ranging from 0 to 444 IU/kg.
Previously untreated patients (PUP)
Safety and efficacy of IDELVION were evaluated in a multicenter open-label clinical study with 12 
previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs) with hemophilia B (≤2% endogenous FIX activity), of 
whom 11 were in the age-range of 0 to 1 years. The median number of exposure days (EDs) was 50 
(range 22 to 146 EDs), and 8 PUPs achieved ≥50 EDs during on-demand, prophylaxis, surgical and 
PK periods.
All 12 PUPs received routine prophylaxis with 11 receiving the 7-day regimen. The overall median 
time on prophylaxis was 11.5 months (range: 3.1 to 32.3 months). In the 9 PUPs on the 7-day 
prophylaxis regimen who reached > 6 months of treatment, median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) 
was 1.16 (range 0 to 3.1). Five of the 9 PUPs had an ABR of 0. The median monthly dose was 195.9 
IU/kg (range 171.8 to 215.6 IU/kg) for the 7-day prophylaxis regimen (N = 9).
Five subjects received on-demand treatment over varying periods prior to prophylaxis, with the 
number of EDs ranging from 1 to 4.
Of the 37 bleeding events observed in 10 PUPs across all study periods, 94% were successfully 
controlled with 1 or 2 infusions.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Adult population
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of IDELVION were evaluated following an intravenous injection of a
single dose of 25, 50 and 75 IU/kg. The PK parameters following a single injection of 50 IU/kg 
IDELVION (see table below) were based on plasma factor IX activity measured by the one-stage 
clotting assay. The mean factor IX activity at day 7 and day 14 was 13.76% and 6.10%, respectively, 
after a single dose of 50 IU/kg IDELVION. Repeat PK assessment for up to 30 weeks demonstrated a 
stable pharmacokinetic profile and incremental recovery was consistent over time.
10
Trough levels of 5-10% have been targeted in clinical studies for achieving bleeding control while on 
prophylaxis. PK simulations suggest the time to reach 5% plasma FIX activity following a single 
injection of 50 IU/kg IDELVION to be 12.5 days for adults.

Trough levels of 5-10% have been targeted in clinical studies for achieving bleeding control while on
prophylaxis. PK simulations suggest the time to reach 5% plasma FIX activity following a single 
11
injection of 50 IU/kg IDELVION to be 7 days for 1-<6years, 9 days for 6-<12 years and 11 days for 
12-<18 years of age). 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, thrombogenicity and local tolerability. 
No investigations on carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicology have been conducted.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling
General instructions
-
The reconstituted solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless. After 
filtering/withdrawal (see below) the reconstituted product should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. 
Reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions.
-
-
Reconstitution
Bring the solvent to room temperature (below 25 °C). Ensure IDELVION and solvent vial flip caps 
are removed and the stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to 
opening the Mix2Vial package.
1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not
remove the Mix2Vial from the blister package!
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the 
blister package and push the spike of the blue adapter 
end straight down through the solvent vial stopper.
1

14
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package 
and not the Mix2Vial set.
4. Place the IDELVION vial on an even and firm surface. 
Invert the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached 
and push the spike of the transparent adapter end 
straight down through the IDELVION vial stopper. 
The solvent will automatically flow into the 
IDELVION vial.
5. With one hand grasp the IDELVION side of the 
Mix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the solvent-
side and unscrew the set carefully counter-clockwise 
into two pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6. Gently swirl the IDELVION vial with the transparent 
adapter attached until the substance is fully dissolved. 
Do not shake.
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the 
IDELVION vial is upright, connect the syringe to the 
Mix2Vial's Luer Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. 
Inject air into the IDELVION vial.

Withdrawal and application
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the 
syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.

15
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and 
disconnect the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the 
syringe by unscrewing counter-clockwise.
9
Care should be taken that no blood enters the syringe filled with product, as there is a risk that the 
blood could coagulate in the syringe and fibrin clots could therefore be administered to the patient. 
The reconstituted IDELVION solution must not be diluted.
The reconstituted solution should be administered by slow intravenous injection. The rate of 
administration should be determined by the patient’s comfort level, up to a maximum of 5 ml/min.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

1. What IDELVION is and what it is used for 
What is IDELVION?
IDELVION is a haemophilia medicine that replaces a natural blood clotting (coagulation) factor IX. 
The active substance in IDELVION is albutrepenonacog alfa (recombinant fusion protein linking 
coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP)).
Factor IX is involved in blood clotting. Patients with haemophilia B have a lack of this factor which 
means that their blood does not clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. 
IDELVION works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot.
What is IDELVION used for?
IDELVION is used to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of factor IX in patients of all age 
groups with haemophilia B (also called congenital factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease).
2. What you need to know before you use IDELVION
Do not use IDELVION

If you are allergic to the active substance (albutrepenonacog alfa) or any of the other ingredients 
(listed in section 6).
If you are allergic to hamster proteins.

Warnings and precautions
43
It is strongly recommended that every time you use IDELVION, you record the name and batch 
number of the product to keep track of the products and product batches you have used. .
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IDELVION.





Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contains traces of hamster 
proteins (see also “Do not use IDELVION”). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, you 
should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor or the treatment 
centre where you are followed. Your doctor should inform you of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, low blood pressure (hypotension), and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that 
causes severe difficulty in breathing, or dizziness).
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial administration of 
IDELVION should be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for 
allergic reactions can be provided. 
The formation of inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) is a known complication that has been 
reported during treatment with IDELVION. The inhibitors stop the treatment from working
properly. If your bleeding is not being controlled with IDELVION, tell your doctor 
immediately. You should be monitored regularly for the development of inhibitors. 
If you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please 
inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications.
If you need a central venous access device (CVAD for injection of IDELVION), the risk of 
complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteraemia) and the formation 
of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted should be 
considered by your doctor.
Other medicines and IDELVION

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
During pregnancy and breast-feeding, IDELVION should be given only if it is clearly needed.

Driving and using machines
IDELVION does not effect your ability to drive and use machines.
IDELVION contains sodium
This medicine contains up to 8.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

How to use IDELVION
Your treatment should be started and monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of 
blood clotting disorders. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with 
your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of IDELVION you need. The amount of IDELVION you need to 
take and the duration of treatment depend on:




the severity of your disease
the site and intensity of the bleeding
your clinical condition and response
your body weight
44
IDELVION is administered as an injection into a vein (intravenous, IV) after reconstitution of the 
powder with the provided solvent by your doctor or nurse. You or somebody else might also 
administer IDELVION as an IV injection but only after receiving adequate training.
If you use more IDELVION than you should 
Please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more IDELVION than your doctor recommends.
If you stop using IDELVION 
Do not stop using IDELVION without consulting your doctor.
Reconstitution and administration
General Instructions

The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial while keeping 
the medicine sterile (germ free). Your doctor will show you how to prepare the solution and 
how to withdraw the solution from the vial correctly.
IDELVION must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in 
section 6.
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e. it might be 
sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or 
withdrawal (see below) the solution should be visually checked, before it is used. Do not use the 
solution if it is cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor.

4. Place the IDELVION powder vial on an even and firm 
surface. Invert the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set 
attached and push the spike of the transparent adapter 
end straight down through the IDELVION vial 
stopper. The solvent will automatically flow into the 
IDELVION vial.
5. With one hand grasp the IDELVION side of the 
Mix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the solvent-
side and unscrew the set carefully counter-clockwise 
into two pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6. Gently swirl the IDELVION vial with the transparent 
adapter attached until the substance is fully dissolved. 
Do not shake.
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the 
IDELVION vial is upright, connect the syringe to the 
Mix2Vial's Luer Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. 
Inject air into the IDELVION vial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Posology
Dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on the 
location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed 
either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of 
normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor IX 
per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by an average of 1.3 IU/dl (1.3 % of normal
activity) in patients ≥ 12 years of age and by 1.0 IU/dl (1.0 % of normal activity) in patients < 12 years 
of age. The required dose is determined using the following formulae:
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (% of normal or IU/dl) x {reciprocal of 
observed recovery (IU/kg per IU/dl)}
Expected factor IX rise (IU/dl or % of normal) = Dose (IU) x Recovery (IU/dl per IU/kg)/body weight 
(kg)
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Patients < 12 years of age
50
For an incremental recovery of 1 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (IU/dl) x 1 dl/kg
Example 
1.
A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 20 kg patient with severe haemophilia B. The 
appropriate dose would be 20 kg x 50 IU/dl x 1 dl/kg = 1000 IUs.
2.
A dose of 1000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 25 kg patient, should be expected to result 
in a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 1000 IUs/25 kg x 1.0 (IU/dl per IU/kg) = 40 IU/dl 
(40 % of normal).
Patients ≥ 12 years of age
For an incremental recovery of 1.3 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: 
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (IU/dl) x 0.77 dl/kg
Example 
3.
A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 80 kg patient with severe haemophilia B.  The 
appropriate dose would be 80 kg x 50 IU/dl x 0.77 dl/kg = 3080 IUs.
4.
A dose of 2000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 80 kg patient, should be expected to result 
in a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 2000 IUs x 1.3 (IU/dl per IU/kg) 
/80 kg = 32.5 IU/dl (32.5 % of normal).
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or in IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage / 
Type of surgical procedure 
Haemorrhage 
Minor or moderate haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding (except iliopsoas) 
or oral bleeding 
Major haemorrhage
Life threatening haemorrhages, 
deep muscle bleeding including 
iliopsoas 
Minor surgery 
Including uncomplicated tooth 
extraction 
Factor IX level 
required (%) (IU/dl)
30 - 60
60 - 100
50 – 80 (pre-and post-
operative)
Major surgery 
60 - 100
(pre-and post- operative)
Frequency of doses (hours) 
/ Duration of therapy (days) 
Single dose should be 
sufficient for majority of 
bleeds. Maintenance dose 
after 24 – 72 hours if there is 
further evidence of bleeding. 
Repeat every 24 – 72 hours 
for the first week, and then 
maintenance dose weekly 
until bleeding stops and 
healing is achieved.
Single dose may be sufficient 
for a majority of minor 
surgeries. If needed, 
maintenance dose can be 
provided after 24 – 72 hours 
until bleeding stops and 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat every 24 – 72 hours 
for the first week, and then 
maintenance dose 1 – 2 times 
per week until bleeding stops 
and healing is achieved.
Prophylaxis 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses are 
35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly.
51
Some patients who are well-controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg 
on an interval of 10 or 14 days. For patients >18 years, further extension of the treatment interval may 
be considered.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
After a bleeding episode during prophylaxis, patients should maintain their prophylaxis regimen as 
closely as possible, with 2 doses of IDELVION being administered at least 24 hours apart but longer if
deemed suitable for the patient.
Paediatric population 
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose regimen is 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. For 
adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for adults (see 
above).
Special warnings and precautions for use
Inhibitors 
After repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for 
the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
using appropriate biological testing. 
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated 
for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. 
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
responses to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor IX activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Measurement 
with a one-stage clotting assay using a kaolin based aPTT reagent or Actin FS aPTT reagent will likely 
result in an underestimation of activity level. This is of importance particularly when changing the 
laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.

On 15 December 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Tivicay. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is ViiV Healthcare UK Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows 2: 
"Tivicay is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, and adolescents and children above 12 6 
years of age.” 
In addition, the CHMP recommended authorisation of two new strengths of tablets, 10 mg and 25 mg. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for 5-aminolevulinic acid (keratosis), 
the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
During the post-marketing phase 20 cases indicative of application site hypersensitivity have been 
received for Ameluz. In 12 cases the reactions started before illumination. Furthermore, a publication was 
identified reporting on occurrence of contact dermatitis after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid or 
methyl-aminolevulinic acid. Positive allergy tests were reported in the study. Therefore, it is recommended 
to include application site hypersensitivity as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for 5-aminolevulinic acid (keratosis) the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 5-aminolevulinic acid (keratosis) is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

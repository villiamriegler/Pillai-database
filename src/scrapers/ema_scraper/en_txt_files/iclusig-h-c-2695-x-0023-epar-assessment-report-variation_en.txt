2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ponatinib  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  produced  by  a  computational  and  structure-based  approach  to  the 
development  of  a  small  molecule  TKI.  Ponatinib  was  designed  with  the  purpose  of  potently  inhibiting  the 
kinase activity of native BCR-ABL, and all mutant variants, including ‘gatekeeper’ T315I. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  on  1  July  2013  for  the  following 
indications in adult patients: (a) chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia 
(CML)  who  are  resistant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib;  who  are  intolerant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib  and  for  whom 
subsequent  treatment  with  imatinib  is  not  clinically  appropriate;  or  who  have  the  T315I  mutation  and  (b) 
Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (Ph+  ALL)  who  are  resistant  to  dasatinib; 
who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; 
or who have the T315I mutation.   
Ponatinib is currently available in the EU as 15 mg  and 45 mg tablet strengths. These two strengths are of 
the same composition and are dose-weight proportional.  
The  applicant  submitted  an  application  for  extension  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Iclusig  30  mg  film 
coated  tablets.  The  results  of  the  bioequivalence  study  AP24534-14-112,  that  evaluated  the  bioequivalence 
of  two  15  mg  tablets  of  ponatinib  compared  to  a  single  30  mg  tablet,  has  been  submitted  to  support  this 
application. 
The  currently  approved  product  information  recommends  a  starting  dose  of  45  mg  of  ponatinib  once  daily. 
Dose modifications (to 30 mg or 15 mg) or interruption of dosing should be considered for the management 
of haematological and non-haematological toxicities (see SmPC section 4.2). In addition dose reduction may 
be considered in patients with chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who have achieved Major 
Cytogenetic  Response.  In  order  to  achieve  a  30  mg  dose,  patients  currently  take  two  15  mg  tablets; 
therefore  the  30  mg  tablet  strength  has  been  developed  to  improve  patient  convenience  by  reducing  the 
number of tablets per dose. The addition of this strength is expected to simplify handling of the tablets by the 
patient  and  the  administration  of  ponatinib.  As  the use  of  multiple dose  units  to  achieve  a  single  dose may 
increase medication errors, the addition of the 30 mg strength is therefore expected to reduce the probability 
of medication error by limiting the daily intake to one single tablet for a 30 mg daily dose. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 30 mg of ponatinib as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:

Page 6/20 
  
  
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with screw-top closures together with 
one plastic canister containing a molecular sieve desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture Iclusig 30 mg film-coated tablets is the same as that employed for 
the manufacture of the approved Iclusig 15 mg and 45 mg film-coated tablets. Therefore, no information on 
the active substance has been submitted or assessed within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Iclusig is currently available in the EU in two strengths: 15 mg and 45 mg immediate release film-coated 
tablets. The aim of this line extension application was to develop an additional 30 mg strength of ponatinib 
immediate release film-coated tablets in order to improve patient convenience and simplify handling when a 
30 mg dose of ponatinib is required. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) for this product was defined in line with the approved strengths as: 
30 mg immediate release film-coated tablets, which are orally bioavailable and allow a once daily 
administration, have a 24 or longer shelf-life, meet appropriate quality criteria and are packaged in a bottle 
configuration sufficiently protective so as to assure the product quality throughout its shelf-life. The critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) identified were: description, identification, assay, degradation products, content 
uniformity, water content and dissolution. 
As the 30 mg tablets represent an intermediate strength to those already approved, the MAH applied the 
same approach used for the already approved strengths to this new strength.  All excipients selected are 
those already used in the already-approved tablets and there are no novel excipients used in the 30 mg 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in section 2.2.1 of this report. 
They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, with 
the exception of Opadry II film-coating system.  Opadry II is a commonly used film-coating system which is 
manufactured using four compendial excipients: talc, Macrogol 4000, polyvinyl alcohol, and titanium dioxide 
(E171). 
The manufacturing process is also analogous, using a common blend and a single direct compression 
tabletting method, resulting in a tablet core composition proportional to the 15 and 45 mg tablets. All tablet 
strengths are white, film-coated, but have different sizes and have different markings to allow differentiation. 
As differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour were not expected, a single dose clinical study was conducted in 
order to assess the bioequivalence of a single 30 mg tablet to two 15 mg tablets in healthy adult subjects 
using standard bioequivalence criteria (see clinical section). Following this bioequivalence study, an in vitro 
dissolution study was conducted to compare the dissolution profile of the three registration batches 
(composite profile) and the commercial scale batch using the dissolution method registered for the 15 and 45 
mg strengths which had previously been shown to be discriminatory. The profiles were shown to be similar 
based on calculation of f2 similarity factors and the differences did not impact on in vivo performance.

Page 7/20 
  
  
The batch size of the 30 mg tablets used in the bioequivalence study was representative of commercial scale. 
Nonetheless, the applicant has committed to carry out comparative dissolution studieson at least for the next 
two commercial scale batches of the 30 mg strength. 
The primary packaging consists of HDPE bottles with screw-top closures, containing 30 film-coated tablets, 
together with one plastic canister containing molecular sieve desiccant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As for the 15 mg and 45 mg strengths, Iclusig 30 mg tablets are manufactured using a direct compression 
process which comprises three steps: blending, compression and film-coating. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Since the 
manufacturing process is the same for all strengths, and the applied strength lies within the range of the 
approved strengths, the validation strategy for the 30 mg tablets employed a bracketing approach. Data from 
three commercial scale batches of the 15 mg tablets and 45 mg tablets (lower and upper ends of 
commercially available strengths) and one commercial scale batch of the 30 mg tablets manufactured at the 
same site were provided. These data demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of dosage form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. It includes 
test  for  description  (visual),  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  water  content  (KF).  The  proposed  specification  is  in  line 
with that approved for the 15 mg and 45 mg strengths. The finished product is released to market based on 
the release specifications, through traditional final product release testing 
The analytical methods used are those already registered for the 15 mg and 45 mg strengths. They have 
been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis results from  three pilot scale and one commercial scale batches of Iclusig 30 mg tablets have 
been provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Since the 15 mg and 45 mg tablets represent the extremes of the ponatinib dose strength range and the 
30 mg tablet uses a common granulate and is dose-proportional to the approved presentations, a bracketing 
approach was selected for the stability studies on the intermediate 30 mg strength. Stability data on three 
pilot scale batches of 30 mg tablets and three commercial scale batches each of 15 mg and 45 mg tablets 
manufactured at the same site and stored under long term conditions for up to 9 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, 
up to 9 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. All batches are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671413/2015 
Page 8/20 
  
  
In addition, supportive stability data from four pilot scale and three commercial scale batches of 15 mg 
tablets, and seven commercial scale batches of 45 mg tablets, manufactured at an alternative site (not used 
for the manufacture of the 30 mg tablets), stored for up 24 months at long term conditions and up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions, were provided. 
Samples were tested for description, water content, dissolution, assay and impurities. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
All the results presented are within specification at all time-points. Stability data currently available for the 30 
mg tablets demonstrate equivalent performance to the approved strengths when stored in the proposed 
commercial packaging configuration. Taken together, the totality of stability data demonstrates the 
comparability of all lots across all strengths and manufacturing sites. 
In addition, a bulk hold study was conducted for all strengths produced at the proposed manufacturing site 
for the 30 mg tablets. One batch of each strength was stored for 12 months at controlled room temperature 
(20-25 ºC) inside two LDPE bags, in between which two bags of desiccant were placed. The LDPE bags were 
closed with cable tie and stored within a HDPE container. Samples were tested for description, water content, 
dissolution, assay, impurities, microbial enumeration. All the results presented met the defined specifications 
at all time-points. 
Moreover, one batch of 15 mg tablets and two batches of 45 mg tablets were exposed to light as defined in 
the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. These batches were 
manufactured at an alternative site not used for the manufacture of the 30 mg tablets, but given the data 
above, can be considered representative of batches manufactured at all sites. Samples were tested for 
description, assay and dissolution before and after light exposure. Although a colour change from white to 
light yellow was observed in tablets directly exposed to light, tablets stored in the proposed commercial HDPE 
bottles met all specificationsBased on available stability data, the currently approved shelf-life for 15 mg and 
45 mg tablets in the proposed packaging configuration of 2 years with a storage precaution of “store in the 
original container in order to protect from light” as stated in the SmPC is equally applicable to the 30 mg 
tablets.  
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
All other components used in the formulation are of vegetable or synthetic origin and do not contain any 
material of bovine, ovine or caprine derivation. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. Since the 30 mg tablets represent an intermediate strength to those already authorised, 
and the three strengths are prepared using a common granulate and the same manufacturing process, a 
bracketing approach has been followed to conduct the process validation and stability studies. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in 
Assessment report

turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  applicant  has  submitted  the  results  of  the  Study  AP24534-14-112:  A  single  dose  bioequivalence  study 
comparing  a  30  mg  tablet  with  two  15  mg  tablets  of  ponatinib  in  healthy  adult  subjects.  This  study 
investigated the relative bioavailability of a single 30 mg ponatinib tablet versus that of two 15 mg ponatinib 
tablets, using standard bioequivalence criteria. 
The proposed 30 mg tablet strength is proportional in dose and weight to the 15 mg and 45 mg tablets. 
The  study  was  conducted  between  07/07/2014  and  09/08/2014  at  INC  Research  Toronto,  Canada.  The 
bioanalytical facility for the study was at Quintiles, New York.  
The primary objective was to determine whether a single dose of a 30 mg ponatinib tablet was bioequivalent 
to  two  15  mg  ponatinib  tablets  in  healthy  subjects  using  standard  bioequivalence  criteria.  The  secondary 
objective was to obtain additional safety and tolerability data on ponatinib in healthy subjects. 
The  study  was  conducted  as  an  open-label,  randomized,  2-period,  crossover  study  in  healthy  subjects.  The 
study consisted of 2 treatment periods separated by a washout period of at least 10 days between ponatinib 
doses. In each treatment period, subjects received either a single oral dose of 30 mg ponatinib tablet or two 
15 mg ponatinib tablets, in randomized order.

Healthy male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, were selected to participate in this study. 
Approximately  34  healthy  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  for  this  study,  with  the  intent  to  ensure 
evaluable data from at least 31 subjects.  A total of 67 subjects were screened for this study. Of these, 46 
subjects  were  eligible  to  proceed  to  the  treatment  phase.  The  most  common  reasons  for  screening  failure 
were  exclusion  criterion  #2  (clinically  significant  vital  signs  or  laboratory  values)  and  inclusion  criterion  #2 
(BMI out of range). 
In total, 36 subjects were randomized to the treatment phase. Of these subjects, 32 (88.9%) completed the 
study. 
Table 1: Summary of Subject Each subject participated in the study for approximately 6 weeks. Participation 
included  a  screening  visit  within  21  days  before  administration  of  the  study  drug  and  two  5-day  (4-night) 
inpatient  stays  separated  by  at  least  10  days  between  study  drug  administrations.  Subjects  returned  for  a 
safety  follow-up  visit  within  10  to  14  days of  the  last  study  drug  administration.  Subjects  were  admitted  to 
the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day –1 of each treatment period. On Day 1, subjects received a single oral 
dose of ponatinib. Subjects remained in the CRU until the morning of Day 4 for completion of PK sampling at 
72 hours. The end of the study was defined as the last visit of the last subject.  
Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (i.e., AB or BA): 
•  Treatment A: one 30 mg ponatinib tablet 
•  Treatment B: two 15 mg ponatinib tablets 
All study drugs were administered in the morning following a 10-hour fast with 240 mL of ambient drinking 
water. Subjects received the study drugs at approximately the same time on each dosing day (±15 minutes). 
For Treatment B, both 15 mg tablets were taken within 5 minutes. 
Ponatinib 15 mg and 30 mg oral tablets were supplied by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in white high-density 
polyethylene  bottles  with  child-resistant  caps  with  liner.  Ponatinib  for  investigational  use  was  supplied  as 
small, round, white, film-coated, biconvex tablets. The 15 mg tablets were marked with A5 on one side and 
no markings on the other side; the 30 mg tablets were marked with C7 on one side and no markings on the 
other side. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Assessment report  
EMA/671413/2015 
Page 11/20 
  
  
 
 
During each treatment period, venous blood samples were collected to determine the plasma concentrations 
of  ponatinib.  Samples  were  collected,  processed,  and  shipped  according  to  the  site’s  Standard  Operating 
Procedures ( SOPs) and instructions from the sponsor or bioanalytical laboratory. In each treatment phase, a 
total  of  15  blood  samples  (5  mL  each)  were  collected  at  pre-dose,  0.5,  1.00,  2.00,  3.00,  4.00,  6.00,  8.00, 
12.00, 18.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00, 60.00 and 72.00 hours post dose. 
The  plasma  samples  were  analysed  by  Quintiles  BioSciences,  Inc.  using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  analytical 
method.  The  calibration  range  was  from  0.5  to  250  ng/mL  (a  5-fold  dilution  was  validated,  extending  the 
range to 1250 ng/mL). 
Plasma samples were shipped frozen on dry ice from the research site to Quintiles BioSciences, Inc.  
The plasma PK parameters for ponatinib included the following: 
•  Cmax: Maximum observed plasma concentration; identified from all available concentration values at 
recorded time points 
•  Tmax: Time to maximum observed plasma concentration; if the same Cmax was recorded more than 
once during the treatment period, the earliest occurrence was considered the Tmax 
•  AUC0-t:  Area  under  the  plasma  concentration  vs  time  curve  from  time  0  to  the  time  of  the  last 
quantifiable concentration; calculated by the log-linear trapezoidal rule using actual times relative to 
dosing (not planned sampling times) 
•  AUC0-∞:  Area  under  the  plasma  concentration  vs  time  curve  from  time  0  to  infinity;  calculated  as 
AUC0-t + Clast / λ, where Clast is the last measureable drug concentration 
• 
t½: Terminal elimination half-life; calculated as ln(2) / λ 
•  λ: Terminal phase rate constant 
•  CL/F: Apparent oral clearance; calculated by the quotient of dose / AUC0-∞ 
•  V/F: Apparent volume of distribution; calculated as dose / (λ × AUC0-∞) 
The  AUC  extrapolation  to  infinity  must  have  been  ≤20%  of  the  total  area  for  AUC0-∞  to  be  considered 
reliable. Parameters such as t½, λ, CL/F, and V/F were flagged for subjects with an unreliable AUC0-∞. 
For  each  of  the  parameters,  the  null  hypothesis  was  that  there  is  a  treatment  effect,  and  the  alternative 
hypothesis was that there is no treatment effect. For each of the contrasts or pairwise comparisons, the null 
hypothesis  was  that  there  was  a  treatment  effect  difference  between  the  tested  pair,  and  the  alternative 
hypothesis was that there was no treatment effect difference between the tested pair. 
The two 1-sided tests were as follows, where T was the test (one 30 mg tablet) and R was the reference (two 
15 mg tablets): 
•  H01: μT/μR ≤ 80% vs HA1: μT/μR > 80% and 
•  H02: μT/μR ≥ 125% vs HA2: μT/μR <125% 
The significance level for each 1-sided test was controlled at 0.05. A 5% Type-I error rate with a p-value less 
than  0.05  was  considered  statistically  significant  for  all  individual  hypothesis  tests.  All  statistical  tests  were 
performed using 2-tailed significance criteria.

Analysis of ln-transformed PK endpoints (Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞) for ponatinib was performed using a 
mixed-effect  model.  The  model  included  treatment  sequence,  period,  and  treatment  as  fixed  effects  and 
subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect. 
The  least  squares  mean  (LSM),  the  difference  between  treatment  LSM,  and  the  standard  error  associated 
with  the  difference  were  calculated  for  each  PK  endpoint.  Residual,  subject  nested  within  sequence,  and 
inter-subject  variance,  along  with  the  intra-subject  and  inter-subject  coefficient  of  variation  (CV),  was 
reported. Ratios of LSM were calculated using the exponential of the difference between treatment LSM from 
the  analyses  on  the  ln-transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t,  and  AUC0-∞.  Bioequivalence  was  concluded  if  the  90% 
confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of population geometric means of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ between 
the 2 treatments were within the equivalence limits of 80% to 125%. 
Tmax was not transformed and was analysed using non-parametric analysis (Walsh averages and appropriate 
quartile  of  the  Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test  statistic).  Median  and  range  for  each  treatment  and  p-value  were 
presented.

a n=28 for AUC0-∞, t1/2, CL/F, and V/F because 4 subjects did not have reliable AUC0-∞ values for both treatments. 
Mean  ponatinib  plasma  concentrations  reached  a  maximum  at  approximately  6  hours  after  intake  of  both 
treatments with 30 mg ponatinib (either as two 15 mg tablets or one 30 mg tablet). PK parameters for both 
treatments  were  similar.  All  subjects  had  quantifiable  ponatinib  plasma  concentrations  up  to  the  final 
sampling  point  at  72  hours  post  dose  for  both  treatments.  The  maximum  mean  concentration  reached  was 
similar  after both  treatments;  the  ponatinib  terminal  elimination  was  the  same  for  the  two treatments.  The

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The study design of trial AP24534-14-112 is acceptable. The washout period of 10 days is adequate for the 
crossover  design  of  the  study,  considering  the  half-life  of  the  ponatinib  (studied  at  the  45  mg  dose)  to  be 
22 hours.    The  sampling  regimen  also  appears  adequate,  with  sufficiently  frequent  sampling  around  the 
period of expected Tmax and sufficiently long period of sampling (72 hours). The pharmacokinetic variables 
are adequate for assessment of bioequivalence. There were no major protocol deviations/violations.  
No pre-dose levels were detected in any subjects in either period in the pharmacokinetic analyses (data not 
shown).  None  of  the  subjects  showed  a  tmax  value  in  the  first  sample  time.  Cmax  detected  in  all  subjects 
were within the validated range.  
For  4  subjects,  selected  PK  parameters  were  excluded  from  the  summary  statistics  and  bioequivalence 
analysis  because  the  extrapolated  area  from  the  last  sampling  time  until  infinity  used  to  estimate  AUC0-∞ 
covered more than 20% of the area (i.e., AUC0-t was less than 80% of AUC0-∞). As per the SAP, the values 
for  AUC0-∞,  t½,  λ,  CL/F,  and  V/F  for  these  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  summary  statistics  and 
statistical analysis. 
The estimated geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 102.3%; the 90% confidence intervals (CI) were 98.1% 
and 106.7%, lower and upper respectively. The estimated geometric mean ratio for AUC0-t was 100.4% and 
the  90%  confidence  intervals  were  97.5%  and  103.4%,  lower  and  upper  respectively.  The  estimated 
geometric  mean  ratio  for  AUC0-∞  was  99.6%  and  the  90%  confidence  intervals  were  96.0%  and  103.4%, 
lower and upper respectively. Bioequivalence of one 30 mg and two 15 mg ponatinib tablets was concluded 
since the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated mean ratio of all 3 parameters of Cmax, AUC0-t, and 
AUC0-∞,  fell  entirely  within  the  80%  to  125%  margins  required  to  conclude  bioequivalence  of  the  two 
treatments.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Study AP24534-14-112 determined that the two treatments of 30 mg ponatinib administered as either one 
30 mg tablet or two 15 mg tablets are bioequivalent. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
N/A 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  population  in  AP24534-14-112  included  all  36  healthy  adult  subjects  in  the  randomized 
population.  A  total  of  32  subjects  in  the  safety  population  completed  both  treatment  periods  and  were 
exposed  to  2  single  doses  of  30  mg  ponatinib  (i.e.,  total  exposure  60  mg  ponatinib).  Four  subjects  were 
withdrawn from the study and did not participate in treatment period 2; they were exposed to a single 30 mg 
dose of ponatinib. One subject was withdrawn from study AP24534-14-112 due to emesis within 10 hours of 
drug  ingestion  (two  15  mg  tablets),  and  2  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  TEAEs:  1  AE  of  prostatitis, 
considered  unlikely  related  to  the  study  drug  (two  15  mg  tablets),  and  1  AE  of  chest  pain,  considered 
possibly related to the study drug (one 30 mg tablet). 
All TEAEs reported in study AP24534-14-112 were mild or moderate in intensity, and most were considered 
related to study treatment. The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher with the two 15 mg tablets of ponatinib 
than  with  the  single  30  mg  tablet;  14  subjects  (40.0%)  experienced  27  TEAEs  and  9  subjects  (27.3%) 
experienced 15 TEAEs following the administration of the 15 mg tablets and 30 mg tablet, respectively. The 
most  common  TEAE  was  headache,  occurring  in  6  subjects  (17.1%)  after  the  two  15  mg  tablets  and  in  2 
subjects  (6.1%)  after  the  single  30  mg  tablet.  The  TEAE  of  lipase  increased  occurred  in  2  subjects  (5.7%) 
and 3 subjects (9.1%) following administration of two 15 mg tablets and one 30 mg tablet, respectively. All 
other TEAEs occurred in only 1 or 2 subjects per treatment. All reported TEAEs were resolved at the end of 
the study. No new type of adverse event was reported in this study which had not been previously reported 
with  ponatinib.  Overall,  all  adverse  events  reported  in  this  study  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile of ponatinib. 
No  serious  adverse  events  or  deaths  were  reported.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  highlighted  in  the  study 
from single doses of 30 mg ponatinib, administered as either on 30 mg tablet or two 15 mg tablets. 
2.6.1.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile observed in AP24534 14 112 was consistent with the known safety profile of 
ponatinib. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The currently approved RMP (version 11.2 dated 27 February 2015) was agreed in the framework of variation 
EMEA/H/C/002695/II/0017 (CHMP opinion issued 26 March 2015). A subsequent version (12.0 dated 8 June 
2015) has been assessed in the framework of PSUR 3. 
The current RMP refers to the two different strengths of ponatinib currently available (15 mg and 45 mg). 
Assessment report  
EMA/671413/2015 
Page 16/20 
  
  
Medication error is not identified as a safety concern in the current RMP. 
The MAH did not submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as part of the variation application to register a 
30 mg tablet for ponatinib. The CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal that the new 30 mg strength has a 
minor impact on the RMP and therefore the RMP will be updated with the new information at the next 
planned update which is foreseen by the end of 2015.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  30  mg  tablet  strength  of  Iclusig  has  been  proposed  to  improve  patient  convenience,  by  reducing  the 
number  of  tablets  per  dose,  when  dose  modifications  (to  30  mg)  are  considered  for  the  management  of 
haematological  and  non-haematological  toxicities.  In  addition,  dose  reduction  may  also  be  considered  in 
patients with chronic phase (CP) CML who have achieved Major Cytogenetic Response.  
The  bioequivalence  study  submitted  (study  AP24534-14-112)  has  demonstrated  bioequivalence  between 
using 2 tablets of 15 mg and a single tablet of 30 mg, in order to administer a dose of 30 mg of Iclusig. 
The benefit risk balance for the proposed 30 mg tablet is considered positive and in line with the benefit risk 
balance concluded for the 15 mg and 45 mg strengths of Iclusig in the current indications. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Iclusig is not similar to mercaptopurine, nelarabine, 
clofarabine, dasatinib, nilotinib, imatinib and bosutinib within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Iclusig in the treatment of chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic 
myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or 
nilotinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the 
T315I mutation, and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are 
Assessment report  
EMA/671413/2015 
Page 17/20 
  
  
 
resistant to dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is 
not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation, is favourable and therefore recommends  the 
granting of a new strength: 30 mg film coated tablets subject to the following conditions:

Subject: Withdrawal of Roctavian, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, 2 x 1013 vector genomes/ml, 
solution for infusion, for Marketing Authorisation Application, EMEA/H/C/0004749  
Dear Dr Schussler-Lenz and Dr Enzmann, 
On behalf of BioMarin, I would like to inform you that, at this point in time, BioMarin 
International Limited has taken the decision to withdraw the application for Marketing 
Authorisation for Roctavian, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, 2 x 1013 vector genomes/ml, solution 
for infusion, which was intended to be used for the treatment of adults with severe haemophilia A. 
This withdrawal is based on the following reason: BioMarin has determined that it will not be 
able to provide the data requested to resolve the CATâ€™s major objection related to the results of 
clinical studies within the current procedure.  
BioMarin confirms that the withdrawal of the Roctavian MAA has no impact for patients in 
ongoing clinical trials. BioMarin remains fully committed to developing Roctavian for the 
treatment of severe haemophilia A.   
We reserve the right to make further submissions at a future date in this or other therapeutic 
indications(s).  
I agree for this letter to be published on the EMA website. 
Yours sincerely,

Extension of Indication to the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 years) for the treatment of 
ABSSSI based on interim results from the safety and efficacy Phase 3 Study DUR001-306, together with 
data from three Phase 1 PK studies (A8841004, DUR001-106, and DAL-PK-02). Consequently, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were updated. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments and QRD updates 
(v10.2) to the SmPC/PL. 
Version 7.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The MAH also requested 1 year of market protection for a new indication (Article 14(11) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0522/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0522/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Not applicable. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

Xydalba (dalbavancin) was authorised in the EU on 19 February 2015 for the treatment of acute bacterial 
skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. This report includes the assessment of an 
application for Xydalba to extend its indication to include the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 
18 years) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI). The proposed 
wording for the new therapeutic indications was (proposed amendment in bold italics): 
Xydalba is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
(ABSSSI) in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 months and older. 
The application relies on the concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety based on comparable 
plasma exposures in children to those in adults. The acceptance of extrapolation is based on assumptions 
that the disease, mechanism of action and thus PK/PD are the same in paediatric patients as in adults 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 7/38 
 
 
 
 
and therefore the doses selected should achieve similar plasma exposures and probability of PK/PD target 
attainment (PTA) in children as in adults. 
ABSSSI is a bacterial infection of the skin and skin structures and includes major cutaneous abscesses, 
wound infection and cellulitis/erysipelas. The most common causative pathogens are Staphylococcus 
aureus and various types of streptococci, such as beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G. 
ABSSSI are among the most common infections seen in clinical practice in adults and in children. These 
infections may require systemic antibacterial therapy, surgical management and hospitalisation. There is 
a need for new antibacterial agents also for the paediatric population that will effectively treat infections 
caused by Gram-positive bacteria including resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Dalbavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide. Its mechanism of action in susceptible Gram-positive 
bacteria involves interruption of cell wall synthesis by binding to the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine of the 
stem peptide in nascent cell wall peptidoglycan, preventing cross-linking (transpeptidation and 
transglycosylation) of disaccharide subunits, thus resulting in bacterial cell death. 
Dalbavancin for Injection (Xydalba), 500 mg, is a sterile, lyophilized, white to off-white to pale yellow, 
preservative-free solid, which must be reconstituted and diluted prior to IV administration. It was 
authorised in the EU on 19 February 2015 for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure 
infections (ABSSSI) in adults. 
The recommended dose of dalbavancin in adult patients with ABSSSI is 1,500 mg administered as either 
a single infusion of 1,500 mg or as 1,000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg. 
In adult patients with chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are 
not receiving regularly scheduled haemodialysis, the recommended dose is reduced to either 1,000 mg 
administered as a single infusion or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg. 
The proposed dose in paediatric patients aged from 6 years to less than 18 years is a single dose of 18 
mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg) and in paediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 6 years a single 
dose of 22.5 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg). No dose reduction is recommended in mild or moderate renal 
impairment and information available is insufficient to recommend dosage adjustment for patients 
younger than 18 years with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
2.1.2.  The development programme 
This application included updates to the safety data submitted in the original Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA), in order to support the proposed paediatric indication in patients from ≥ 3 months to 
< 18 years of age for ABSSSI caused by designated susceptible strains of Gram-positive microorganisms 
for dalbavancin (for injection). These are based on a development programme including results from the 
DUR001 306 study, together with data from 3 Phase 1 PK studies (A8841004, DUR001-106 and DAL PK 
02), PK/PD modelling and simulations, and the data from the adult safety and efficacy studies.  
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
All studies in the dalbavancin programme were and are being conducted in conformance with GCP 
Guidelines, ICH Guidelines E6 (1996) and E3 (1995), and CFR Title 21 Part 56, and in accordance with 
the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
The currently approved adult formulation, 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is 
intended to be used also for children from 3 months of age.  
The powder contains the excipients mannitol, lactose monohydrate, hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment) 
and sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment). After reconstitution with water for injections the vial contains 25 
ml of 20 mg/ml dalbavancin. The concentrate is further diluted with 5% glucose and the diluted solution 
for solution must have a final concentration of 1-5 mg/ml dalbavancin. The final concentration of the 
excipients mannitol and lactose monohydrate will range from 0.25 mg/ml to 1.25 mg/ml. 
Since the application concerns the introduction of a paediatric population, the suitability of the proposed 
formulation in the proposed age group was addressed, in line with the Guideline on pharmaceutical 
development of medicines for paediatric use EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev.2. No such justification 
has been provided but this is accepted since the proposed adult formulation only contains commonly used 
excipients in amounts for which no safety issues are foreseen in the proposed target age group. 
A single dose of 22 mg/kg is proposed for children of 3 months to < 6 years age given a range of a final 
volume of 22 ml to 110 ml to be administered to children weighing 5.5 kg as a single intravenous infusion 
over a 30-minute period. 
The proposed formulation is considered acceptable from a quality point of view. However, a dosing 
schedule including dilution volumes was added to the instructions in the SmPC and PL in order to 
minimise the risk of dosing errors and to facilitate the handling of the drug product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data were submitted with this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
In accordance with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) a dose range-finding study with dalbavancin in 
neonatal rat (00388/07GR133) and a definitive juvenile rat toxicology study of dalbavancin 
(LIA00402/07GR242) were performed and submitted. These studies were submitted as part of the 
original MAA submission regarding the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
(ABSSSI) in adults. Compliance with the PIP was confirmed. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
With this application, the MAH provided an updated Environmental risk assessment (ERA) to take into 
account the increased patient use of the product in the juvenile population from ≥3 months age. 
Phase I 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
In the original MAA ERA submitted to support Xydalba for the treatment of ABSSSI in adults, the 
Predicted Environmental Concentration PECSURFACEWATER was calculated to 0.00729 μg/L. This figure was 
based on a refined Fpen where the consumption (CONai) was 2676931500 mg/year. In the ERA initially 
submitted with this application, the Fpen for the paediatric population was refined using the same data. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 9/38 
 
 
 
 
A PECSURFACEWATER-TOTAL was generated by adding the PECs for the adult and paediatric populations which 
resulted in a PECSURFACEWATER-TOTAL of 0.02 μg/L. This is above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L where a Phase II 
assessment should be performed. However, no full Phase II programme has been performed and 
submitted. Instead, the MAH refered to a Phase II, Tier A study (OECD 209) used in the original ERA to 
evaluate the potential environmental impact of dalbavancin on microorganisms. The NOEC in the study 
was 227mg/l which gives a PNEC of 22.7 mg/l resulting in a PEC/PNEC ratio of 0.0000009. As the RQ is 
below 1, the MAH was of the opinion that no further studies were needed. 
This conclusion was not agreed by CHMP as the calculations use for the Fpen refinement were considered 
to overestimate the market penetration. The MAH was therefore asked to revisit the calculations, perform 
new ones based on the most appropriate data.  
In the response, the MAH provided a thoroughly revised ERA evaluating the potential environmental risks 
associated with dalbavancin use via the Xydalba product. As the unrefined PECSURFACEWATER was initially 
calculated to 0.021 (above the Phase I action limit of 0.01 μg/L) the MAH refined the Fpen using ABSSSI 
prevalence data from two journals in the publication domain. According to the guidelines, the prevalence 
in the region with the highest prevalence of the disease should be used for calculation of the FPEN. Data 
provided from Germany where an FPEN (based on the published data) was found to be 0.00312, being 
the highest one. Use of the prevalence figure for Germany resulted in a calculated PECSURFACEWATER-REFINED 
of 0.0064 μg/L which is below the 0.01 μg/L threshold, where a complete Phase II environmental fate and 
effect analysis would be expected. 
Phase II 
Aquatic Effect Studies 
Activated Sludge, Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209) 
The activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (ASRIT) study was completed to determine the effects of 
dalbavancin on activated sludge microorganisms. The microorganism respiration rate was evaluated 
under defined conditions in the presence of dalbavancin (test concentrations of 0.10, 1, 10, 100, and 
1000 mg/L), a dilution water control, and 3,5-dichlorophenol reference toxicant. The study was completed 
according to OECD Guideline 209. The results were as follows:

Risk characterisation 
A PECSURFACEWATER-TOTAL of 0.00002, as calculated in Phase I, was used in this Phase II Tier A assessment.  
Using the results from the dalbavancin OECD 209-study above, a PNEC was calculated following guidance 
from the EMA and ECHA. The EC15 was used to approximate the No-Observed-Effect Concentration 
(NOEC) for sludge microorganisms1 and was used to calculate the PNECMICROORGANISM. 
Studied Species NOEC (mg/L) - Sludge Microorganisms  227 
The PNEC for the activated sludge microbial community was determined by applying an assessment factor 
(AF) of 10 to this value. 
PNECMICROORGANISM = 227mg/L/10 
PNECMICROORGANISM = 22.7 mg/L 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 10/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PEC/PNECMICROORGANISM = 0.00002/22.7 
PEC/PNECMICROORGANISM = 0.0000009 < Action limit of 0.1 
Based on a PEC/PNECMICROORGANISM risk quotient < 0.1, dalbavancin is unlikely to represent a risk to 
microorganisms. No further testing is required. 
Summary of Phase II Tier A Fate and Effects Analysis 
Using the approach in the EMA Guideline and Q&A including the conservative assumption of no depletion 
due to metabolism, the PEC/PNEC ratio for dalbavancin for sludge microorganisms was calculated. The 
PEC/PNEC ratio for microorganisms was substantially less than 0.1. Additionally, the n-octanol-buffer 
distribution coefficient, Log Pow, of 2.3 does not indicate the potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic 
species. Therefore, based a conservative analysis of the above presented environmental data, it has been 
determined that dalbavancin is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment. In line with EU Directive 
2001/83/EC, the European patient information leaflet includes the following general statement, for the 
purpose of reducing any risks to the environment with regard to the administration to patients and 
disposal of waste products: "Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements". 
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed to support this change in indication. However, as part of 
the MAA for Xydalba in adults, a dose range-finding study and a definitive study with dalbavancin in 
neonatal rat (PND7-63) were submitted and assessed. The toxicity profile observed in juvenile rats was 
consistent with that previously observed in adult rats at the same dose levels. In repeat dose toxicology 
studies (up to 3 months exposure) dalbavancin was shown to induce similar systemic toxicity in both rats 
and dogs with kidneys, liver and the haematological system identified as the main target organs. Local 
and systemic toxicological changes partially reversed in parallel with decreasing plasma dalbavancin 
concentrations and in proportion to the length of the recovery interval. The CHMP has no objections 
regarding the approval of Xydalba in the paediatric population from a non-clinical perspective. 
An ERA based on the ERA submitted as part of the MAA for the adult indication was submitted. A 
PECSURFACEWATER-TOTAL was generated by adding the PECs for the adult and paediatric populations which 
resulted in a PECSURFACEWATER-TOTAL of 0.02 μg/L. The calculations use for the Fpen refinement seemed to 
overestimate the market penetration and the MAH was therefore asked to revisit the calculations, perform 
new calculations based on the most appropriate data and justify the new calculations.  
The MAH provided therefore a thoroughly revised ERA  evaluating the potential environmental risks 
associated with dalbavancin use via the Xydalba product. The new calculated PECSURFACEWATER-REFINED of 
0.0064 μg/L was below the 0.01 μg/L (threshold where a complete Phase II environmental fate and effect 
analysis would be expected). It is therefore concluded that the ERA data for Xydalba in the proposed use 
have not identified a risk to the environment. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of dalbavancin. 
Considering the above data, dalbavancin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This extension of indication to paediatric patients (aged 3 months to <18 years) relies on the concept of 
extrapolation of efficacy based on comparable dalbavancin plasma exposures in children to those in 
adults. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Type of Study 
Design 
Multicenter, randomized, open-label, 
single-dose study in preterm neonates 
to infant ages < 3 months with 
suspected or confirmed bacterial 
infection 
Primary endpoints: PK 
parameters, safety, and 
tolerability. 
Planned number of 
participants: 22 
Due to difficulty in 
recruitment, and because 
participants in this age range 
were also being enrolled in 
Study DUR001-306 with a 
similar PK sampling 
schedule, enrollment was 
stopped in October 2019.  
Final enrollment: 
8 participants (6 in Cohort 1 
and 1 each in Cohorts 2 and 
3) 
To fulfil European health authority requirements for the PIP, the study will continue to enroll in Cohort 5 (birth 
a 
to < 3 months) for a total of 212 participants. The study completion date is planned for December 2023 based on the 
latest PIP Modification. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The validated bioanalytical methods used in the clinical development programmes were precise and 
accurate, and the assay validation characteristics were acceptable. No new biopharmaceutical 
information/methods were provided with this submission. 
popPK 
Objective 
This analysis was undertaken with the goal of updating a previously developed pediatric popPK model for 
dalbavancin, evaluate the impact of (pediatric) patient covariates on the PK of dalbavancin, and 
investigate target attainment for the current dosing regimen. The target attainment metrics were based 
on free dalbavancin exposure over MIC, in line with a previous dalbavancin target attainment analysis in 
adults. 
The analysis represents a comprehensive popPK examination of all currently available pediatric PK data 
collected in three Phase I trials and one Phase III of dalbavancin in patients with ABSSSI, to support dose 
selection across the entire pediatric age-range. 
Dataset 
A total of 1124 PK observations from 211 patients were included in the model development after 
excluding 33 BQL observations and 18 records due to other exclusion reasons such as, pre-dose PK 
observations, missing PK data and outlier records based on early model fit CWRES assessment. 
The three Phase 1 pediatric studies of dalbavancin for the treatment of ABSSSI have been completed. A 
Phase 3 pediatric comparator-controlled trial study is currently ongoing from which interim data was 
included in the current analysis. 
Individual dalbavancin plasma concentration-time profiles on a semi-logarithmic scale, stratified by study 
and single or two-dose regimen were provided with data suggesting at least a biphasic disposition in the 
majority of the patients.

Methods 
This analysis was undertaken with the goal of updating a previously developed pediatric popPK model. 
Because of the wide age- and weight-range of the patients included in this analysis, weight-based scaling 
(via allometry) of all the structural popPK parameters was considered appropriate (and necessary) from 
the start of model development. In addition, based on prior knowledge of dalbavancin PK in adult and 
pediatric populations and exploratory analysis of the current dataset, serum albumin was included as a 
covariate on all PK parameters and renal function (CLCRN or EGFR [for subjects younger than 2 years of 
age]) was included as a covariate on CL. In a subsequent stepwise covariate search, no other covariates 
(AGE, RACE, SEX) were found to be statistically significant. 
Final popPK model 
The final model was a 3-compartment model with first-order elimination, a proportional error model with 
a separate proportional error for the phase III study, IIV in CL, V, V2 and V3 and with estimated 
covariances between CL, V and V2. The final model included parameter-covariate relationships for WT 
(allometry) on all PK parameters (fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 for clearances and 1 for volumes), 
ALB on all PK parameters (the correlated effect modeled via F1) and renal function (CLCRN or EGFR) on 
CL. Shrinkage in ETA1(CL), ETA2(V) and ETA3 (V2) was 4%, 4% and 14% respectively. 
Goodness of fit plots and visual predictive checks (VPCs) 
Goodness of fit plots, pcVPS and VPCs stratified age demonstrated that the final model has good 
predictive performance across the full age range. 
The GoF and VPCs support that the model’s predictive performance is satisfactory. No major trends are 
seen. The pcVPC zoomed in for the first 24 h after dose support that the model is satisfactory also for 
early time points. The VPCs stratified on age group support that the model’s predictive performance is 
satisfactory for all paediatric age groups including toddlers, young infants and infants. The VPCs reveal 
that there is less observed data in toddlers and young infants. The data is considered sufficient for the 
indication proposed with this application (from 3 months of age). 
Simulations – methods 
Using the final popPK model, dalbavancin PK was simulated for the complete pediatric age-range (pre-
term neonates at birth and term neonates up to adolescents of 17.9 years of age). A simulation dataset 
was created for the following distinct age groups: adolescents (≥12 - < 18 y), children (≥6 - < 12 y), 
toddlers (≥ 2 - < 6 y), infants (≥3 months - < 2 y), young infants (≥1 month - < 3 months), term 
neonates (birth - < 1 month) and preterm neonates at birth (gestational age (GA) 26 weeks - < 37 
weeks). The plasma concentrations were simulated for each subject at the following timepoints: 0.5 (end-
of-infusion), 1 to 120, 144, and 648 h after IV dalbavancin administration. Dense sampling (hourly) up to 
120h after start of treatment was applied for the calculation of AUC for the purposes of the fAUC/MIC 
index. For each category, sex, and regimen 500 subjects were simulated to emulate the pediatric Phase 
III design for a total of 7000 subjects. 
Simulations – comparison of paediatric and adult exposure 
Simulations of the population mean PK profiles over time for the pediatric age and adult classes, 
demonstrated comparable dalbavancin concentration vs. time profiles across the age-dependent dose 
level. 
The box plots depicting the variability show a large overlap of paediatric and adult exposure, with the 
paediatric exposure generally slightly lower than adult reference exposure and preterm neonates appear 
to have the lowest AUC and Cmax.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 14/38 
 
 
 
 
From a safety perspective, there are no issues with the proposed paediatric posology which provide 
slightly lower but largely overlapping exposure as in adults. 
Simulation renal impairment 
Regarding paediatric patients with renal function below 30 mL/min, no data were submitted. The MAH 
conducted simulations using the CrCLN-CL relationship estimated for the adult population PK model. The 
simulations indicated that a 25-33% reduction in dose for pediatric subjects with severe renal 
impairment, similar to that approved for adults, is warranted. However, due to the lack of data in 
paediatric patients with severe renal impairment, the MAH believed that there was insufficient information 
to recommend a dose regimen for pediatric patients with CrCL< 30 mL/min. However, the CHMP 
requested a further discussion on the adequacy of the simulations in paediatric patients with CrCL< 30 
mL/min/1.73m2 and if a dose recommendation could be included for some age groups. A discussion on 
this issue and the final CHMP recommendations for the PI is included in section 2.4.4 (Discussion and 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology). 
2.4.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Target 
Target attainment simulations were performed with the new paediatric popPK model for the revised non-
clinical dalbavancin fAUC/MIC targets for stasis, 1-log kill, and 2-log kill (27.1, 53.3, and 111.1 h, 
respectively) (Lepak et al., 2015). The daily free dalbavancin exposure metric, (fAUCavg), used for 
calculating PTA, was defined as fAUC0−120/5 with the assumption of 93% of drug bound to albumin. 
PTA - adults and paediatric patients 
A 2-log kill target attainment for all simulated age groups with respect to MIC values ranging from 0.002 
to 16 μg/mL and in relation to the MIC distributions for the 4 most relevant species of pathogens was 
obtained in the JMI-analyzed microbial surveillance data from 2017. The comparison between the highest 
observed MICs (0.25 μg/mL) and the MIC where predicted TA starts to decrease under the current 
treatment regimen, indicates that these regimens would continue to provide attainment of the preclinical 
PK/PD target for several additional MIC dilutions of pathogen potency beyond what is currently observed 
in the United States and Europe. 
The simulated dalbavancin exposure in paediatric patients and adults were largely overlapping except for 
pre-term neonates. As expected, the PTA for adults and the paediatric patients, except neonates are 
similar. Since pre-term neonates were not included in this application, this issue was not pursued. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
This extension of indication (to paediatric patients aged 3 months to <18 years) application relied on the 
concept of extrapolation of efficacy based on comparable dalbavancin plasma exposures in children to 
those in adults. The extrapolation approach is suitable for antibacterial agents because the PD target is 
expected to respond similarly to similar plasma concentrations of antibacterial agent in both adult and 
paediatric patients. 
The popPK model used to support the proposed dosing on paediatric patients is deemed satisfactory. The 
exposure in paediatric patients and adult are largely overlapping, however the mean exposures lower in 
paediatric patients. To support that this slightly lower exposure would not risk loss of efficacy, the MAH 
provided PTA simulations. The simulations support the proposed paediatric dosing regimen. 
From a safety perspective, there were no issues with the proposed paediatric posology as the dalbavancin 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

exposure in paediatric subjects results in slightly lower exposure compared to adults. 
Regarding adolescents, it was unclear why above a certain body weight they cannot be dosed as adults 
(i.e. with a fixed dose). With the 18 mg/kg single dose and a 1500 mg maximum dose, adolescent 83 kg 
and above receive the same dose as adults. It may be reasonable and appropriate that adolescent above 
a certain body weight receive the same dose as adults. At the same time, adolescents with low body 
weight could be overexposed with 1500 mg flat single dose. The MAH was therefore asked to further 
discuss if it would be reasonable and appropriate for adolescents above a certain body weight to receive 
the same dose as adults. In their response the MAH indicated that the recommended dose of dalbavancin 
in paediatric patients aged from 6 years to 18 years is a single dose of 18 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose 
of 1500 mg). This corresponds to a 1500 mg single flat dose for adolescents with a body weight of 83.3 
kg or above. Dalbavancin exposures using this WT-based dosing strategy resulted in simulated individual 
paediatric exposures that are within the range of the adult exposures observed in Phase 3. As the weight-
based posology in adolescents is within the range of adult exposure from phase 3, the MAH did not 
propose an update of the dose to 1500 mg flat dose as adults, which was accepted by the CHMP. 
Concerning the simulation on renal impairment patients, the MAH further clarified that no paediatric 
patients in the studies had an estimated CrCl < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 and provided simulations results for 
paediatric patients with renal impairment. These simulations support a dose reduction of 25-33% in 
paediatric patients with severe renal impairment (similar to adults). 
The MAH maintained that given the lack of data in paediatric patients with severe renal impairment, there 
was insufficient information to recommend a dose regimen for paediatric patients in any age group with 
CrCl < 30 ml/min/1.73m2. The MAH’s reasoning was accepted, and the following recommendation was 
agreed for addition to section 4.2 of the SmPC for paediatric patients with renal impairment: “There is 
insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustment for patients younger than 18 years with 
creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Currently available information is described in section 
5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.” Information regarding the pharmacokinetics of 
dalbavancin in paediatric patients was also added to section 5.2 of the SmPC. The PL was updated 
accordingly.

Objectives and endpoints 
The primary purpose of this study was to determine the safety and descriptive efficacy of dalbavancin for 
the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in children, from birth to 17 
years (inclusive), known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms, including 
methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.

Sample size 
Planned: approximately 188 participants, with 178 participants 3 months or older randomized to receive 
dalbavancin (single-dose or 2-dose regimen) or comparator. 
The study was primarily a PK and safety study. The sample size was not based on a power calculation for 
hypothesis testing. 
Randomisation 
There was a 3:3:1 randomization scheme: 76 participants were to be randomized to dalbavancin (single 
dose IV), 76 to dalbavancin (2 doses once weekly IV therapy), and 26 to comparator (IV vancomycin or 
IV oxacillin or flucloxacillin). The randomization scheme did not include the youngest age cohort (birth to 
< 3 months of age), as all 10 participants in this cohort were to receive the single-dose regimen of 
dalbavancin, bringing the total number of participants planned to be enrolled in the study to 
approximately 188. 
Blinding (masking)

Analysis Populations 
• 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomized participants regardless of whether or not they received 
study drug. 
•  Safety: All participants in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
•  Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT): All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had a diagnosis of ABSSSI (or a suspected or confirmed sepsis for Cohort 5) not 
known to be caused exclusively by a Gram-negative organism. 
•  Clinically Evaluable (CE): Four CE populations were defined based on the timing of the outcome 
assessment, CE-48-72 hours (post randomization), CE-EOT, CE-TOC, and CE-Follow-up visit. 
•  Microbiological ITT (microITT): All participants in the ITT population who had at least 1 Gram-

microITT population. Four ME populations were defined based on the timing of the outcome 
assessment, ME-48-72 hours (post randomization), ME-EOT, ME-TOC, and ME-Follow-up visit. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy analyses were based on the mITT Population and specified CE, microITT, and ME populations. No 
statistical testing was planned for the efficacy endpoints. 
Safety 
Safety analyses were based on the safety population. Participants who received the wrong regimen of 
study drug for their entire course of treatment were analysed in the group based on the regimen 
received.

Conduct of the study 
Prior to database lock, there were 6 amendments to the original protocol. 
There were no changes to planned analysis methods from what was described in the protocol and detailed 
in the SAP.

A total of 70 participants (35.4%) had significant protocol deviations: study procedure (47 participants, 
23.7%); informed consent (8 participants, 4.0%); inclusion criteria (8 participants, 4.0%); study 
intervention dosing non-compliance (7 participants, 3.5%); exclusion criteria (7 participants, 3.5%); and 
wrong study intervention dose (5 participants, 2.5%). 
Baseline data 
All participants in the microITT population had at least 1 Gram-positive (aerobic) pathogen from the 
ABSSSI site or blood at baseline. The most common pathogen was oxacillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus 
identified in a total of 105 participants (84.0%), followed by Streptococcus pyogenes identified in 12 
participants (9.6%), oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus identified in 6 participants (4.8%), Enterococcus 
faecalis in 4 participants (3.2%), and Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis in 4 participants (3.2%). 
For all isolates that are considered label pathogens for dalbavancin, the MIC was at or below the EUCAST 
susceptible breakpoint (≤ 0.125 mg/L). No isolates were non-susceptible to dalbavancin, which is 
consistent with prior clinical trials in adult participants with ABSSSI. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus 
was 0.06 μg/mL (both MSSA and MRSA). 
Numbers analysed 
Analysis populations (screened population) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The clinical response rate or cure rate was 90% or above as assessed by both the investigators and 
sponsor, in all treatment arms and across analysis populations. Clinical response at 48-72 hours (FDA 
recommended primary endpoint for efficacy studies in ABSSSI) and at later timepoints are tabled below. 
The proportion of clinical responders was generally similar across all age cohorts. 
Ancillary analyses 
Clinical response rates by baseline pathogen and microbiological response rates (generally presumed 
eradication based on lack of follow-up cultures) at different time-points and for different analysis 
populations were generally in line with the clinical response rates (data not shown). There have been no 
deaths in the study to date. Detailed subpopulation analyses were not performed as the patient numbers 
were not sufficient to support investigation of efficacy in subpopulations.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This extension of indication application to include the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 
years) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) relies on the 
concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety based on comparable plasma exposures in children 
to those in adults. The principle of extrapolation is endorsed and thus the descriptive nature of the 
efficacy data. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study DUR001-306 is a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised, comparator-controlled trial of the 
safety and efficacy of dalbavancin versus active comparator in paediatric subjects with acute bacterial 
skin and skin structure infections. The study is still ongoing and continues to enrol participants in Cohort 
5 (from birth to < 3 months) to satisfy European health authority requirements; currently 198 
participants have enrolled. The study has included male and female paediatric patients from birth to 17 
years of age with ABSSSI suspected or confirmed to be caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including 
MRSA. An alternative clinical picture of suspected or confirmed sepsis was also acceptable for the 
youngest age cohort (from birth to < 3 months). The infections had to be of sufficient severity to merit 
hospitalisation and parental antibacterial therapy. 
The study compared single dose of IV dalbavancin or two doses of IV dalbavancin administered 1 week 
apart with a 10-to-14-day course of IV vancomycin (for infections caused by methicillin-resistant 
bacteria) or IV oxacillin or flucloxacillin (for infections caused by methicillin-susceptible bacteria) with an 
option to switch to oral treatment (cefadroxil or clindamycin) after at least 72 h of study drug treatment if 
they met criteria for oral therapy. 
Efficacy objectives and endpoints were secondary and descriptive in nature including assessment of 
clinical response rate and clinical response rate by baseline pathogen at different timepoints and all-cause 
mortality at the test-of-cure visit 28 days after start of therapy (cohort 5 only [birth to <3 months]). 
The sample size was not based on a power calculation for hypothesis testing. There was a 3:3:1 
randomization scheme. The randomization scheme did not include the youngest age cohort (birth to < 3 
months of age), as all 10 participants in this cohort were to receive the single-dose regimen of 
dalbavancin. 
Efficacy analyses were based on the mITT Population (all randomized participants who received at least 1 
dose of study drug and had a diagnosis of ABSSSI (or a suspected or confirmed sepsis for Cohort 5) not 
known to be caused exclusively by a Gram-negative organism) and specified CE, microITT, and ME 
populations. No statistical testing was planned for the efficacy endpoints. 
The design of the study to primarily provide PK and safety data and descriptive efficacy data from 
paediatric patients with ABSSSI (or sepsis in case of the youngest cohort) was accepted. Overall, the 
design of the study to include a relevant study population for this purpose was endorsed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total 198 subjects were included in the study (9 subjects aged form birth to < 3 months, 20 subjects 
aged 3 months to < 2 years, 45 subjects aged 2 years to < 6 years, 60 subjects aged 6 years to < 
12years and 64 subjects aged 12 years to 17 years). The majority of study participants were male (62%) 
and white (88%). ABSSSI infection types were distributed on major cutaneous abscess 52%, cellulitis 
29% and wound infection 19%.

All participants in the microITT population had at least 1 Gram-positive (aerobic) pathogen from the 
ABSSSI site or blood at baseline. The most common pathogen was oxacillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus 
identified in a total of 105 participants (84.0%), followed by Streptococcus pyogenes identified in 12 
participants (9.6%), oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus identified in 6 participants (4.8%), Enterococcus 
faecalis in 4 participants (3.2%), and Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis in 4 participants (3.2%). 
For all isolates that are considered label pathogens for dalbavancin, the MIC was at or below the EUCAST 
susceptible breakpoint (≤ 0.125 mg/L). No isolates were non-susceptible to dalbavancin. 
The clinical response rates at 48-72 hours were 96.4% (81/84), 98.6% (73/74) and 89.7% (26/29) in the 
dalbavancin single-dose, dalbavancin two-dose and comparator groups, respectively. At the TOC visit the 
response rates were above 90% in all treatment groups (95.1%, 97.3% and 100.0%, respectively). The 
response rates were essentially unchanged at the follow-up visit compared with at TOC. 
Clinical response rates by baseline pathogen and microbiological response rates (generally presumed 
eradication based on lack of follow-up cultures) at different time-points and for different analysis 
populations were generally in line with the clinical response rates. There have been no deaths in the 
study to date. Detailed subpopulation analyses were not performed as the patient numbers were not 
sufficient to support investigation of efficacy in subpopulations. 
Overall, the efficacy results from paediatric Study DUR001-306 are consistent with data from the adult 
Phase 3b Study DUR001-303. 
DUR001-303 was a Phase 3b, double-blind, multicentre, randomised study to compare the efficacy and 
safety of single dose dalbavancin to a 2-dose regimen of dalbavancin for the treatment of ABSSSI. In 
each of the studies, the majority of participants were white with a higher percentage of male participants 
compared with female participants. Overall, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA) was reported in 94.2% of 
participants in the dalbavancin single-dose group and 87.3% of participants in the dalbavancin 2-dose 
group in Study DUR001-306 and in 65.2% of participants in the dalbavancin single-dose group and 
65.9% of patients in the dalbavancin 2-dose group in Study DUR001-303. MRSA was reported in a 
smaller number of participants (3.8% and 7.3% of participants in the dalbavancin single-dose and 2-dose 
groups respectively in Study DUR001-306, and 17.1% and 27.7% of participants in the dalbavancin 
single-dose and 2-dose groups respectively in Study DUR001-303. 
In DUR001-306, the proportion of clinical responders at 48 to 72 hours, as assessed by the sponsor, was 
96.4% in the dalbavancin single-dose arm and 98.6% in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm (mITT). Similarly, 
the proportion of clinical responders at 48 to 72 hours was 81.4% in the dalbavancin single-dose arm and 
84.2% in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm (ITT) in Study DUR001-303. The clinical cure rate at the TOC visit 
(Day 28) in the mITT population in Study DUR001-306, as assessed by the sponsor, was 95.1% in the 
dalbavancin single-dose arm and 97.3% in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm (mITT). The clinical success rate 
at the Final Visit (Day 28) was 84.5% in the dalbavancin single-dose arm and 85.1% in the dalbavancin 
2-dose arm (ITT) in Study DUR001-303. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical response rates in the paediatric ABSSSI study DUR001-306 were numerically comparable in 
dalbavancin single-dose, dalbavancin 2-dose and comparator groups, respectively, and moreover in line 
with the response rates in the adult study DUR001-303.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Studies contributing to the paediatric safety data are study DUR001-306 which is described in the efficacy 
section and the following studies: 
DAL-PK-02 
Study DAL-PK-02 was a multicentre, randomized, open-label, single-dose Phase 1 study in preterm 
neonates to infant ages < 3 months with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. A total of 22 
participants were planned to be enrolled in the following 3 cohorts: Cohort 1, young infants aged > 28 
days to < 3 months; Cohort 2, term neonates (defined as gestational age ≥ 37 weeks) aged ≤ 28 days; 
Cohort 3, preterm neonates (defined as gestational age ≥ 32 to < 37 weeks) aged ≤ 28 days. However, 
due to difficulty in recruitment, and because participants in this age range were also being enrolled in 
Study DUR001-306 with a similar PK sampling schedule, enrolment was stopped in October 2019. The 
final enrolment included 8 participants, with 6 participants in Cohort 1, and 1 participant each in Cohorts 
2 and 3. The dose for all participants was 22.5 mg/kg dalbavancin administered as a 30-minute IV 
infusion. 
A8841004 
Study A8841004, was an open-label, multicentre Phase 1 study designed to investigate the PK, safety 
and tolerability of a single dose of IV dalbavancin in 10 paediatric participants from 12 to 17 years of age 
receiving standard IV anti-infective treatment for bacterial infections. In this study, a single dose of 1000 
mg dalbavancin was administered to participants weighing ≥ 60 kg and 15 mg/kg for participants 
weighing < 60 kg. The dose was given as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1. 
DUR001-106 
Study DUR001-106 was an open-label, single-dose Phase 1 study to investigate the PK, safety, and 
tolerability of dalbavancin in hospitalized children aged 3 months to 11 years receiving standard IV anti-
infective treatment for bacterial infections. Participants in this study were enrolled and evaluated in 3 age 
cohorts: Cohort 1 (6 to 11 years of age), Cohort 2 (2 to < 6 years of age), and Cohort 3 (3 months to < 
2 years of age). The planned dalbavancin doses were 15 mg/kg (not to exceed the adult dose of 1000 
mg) for participants ≥ 5 years of age (n = 11), and 25 mg/kg for participants < 5 years of age (n = 7), 
administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on Study Day 1. After an interim PK analysis, the dosage for 
Cohort 3 (3 months to < 2 years of age) was reduced to 10 mg/kg. 
Adult safety profile 
The adverse effect profile of dalbavancin is essentially similar to those of other glycopeptides, with 
important exceptions: vancomycin and teicoplanin are both associated with nephrotoxicity and 
ototoxicity; dalbavancin on the other hand, has not clearly been associated with such toxicities at the 
proposed dose regimen. 
The most common adverse reactions in the adult development programme occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients 
treated with dalbavancin were nausea (2.4 %), diarrhoea (1.9 %), and headache (1.3 %) and were 
generally of mild or moderate severity. Important identified risks in the Summary of the safety concerns 
in the Risk Management plan (tabled below) includes emergence of resistance, pseudomembranous colitis 
and hypersensitivity. Important potential risks include hepatic disorder, otovestibular toxicity, 
nephrotoxicity and haematological effects. There are no ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities to 
characterize these risks further. Moreover, there are no ongoing additional risk minimisation measures for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

any of the safety concerns. Routine risk minimisation measures are considered sufficient to manage these 
concerns. 
Patient exposure 
Cumulative exposure 
The clinical experience with dalbavancin includes subjects in 28 completed Phase 1 to 3 clinical studies 
and adult participants have been exposed to dalbavancin in the post marketing setting. The clinical study 
program (completed and ongoing studies) consists of 4511 healthy participants and participants with 
infections who have been enrolled and received study medication, of which 3123 were treated with 
dalbavancin and 1388 were treated with a comparator (1316 active comparator and 72 placebo). 
Exposure in paediatric participants 
In Study DUR001-306, 198 participants were enrolled as of 21 June 2021, including 90 in the dalbavancin 
single-dose arm and 78 in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm. All 198 of these participants finished the study as 
of 05 November 2020, and their data has been locked. However, the study is ongoing to enrol more 
participants in Cohort 5 to satisfy European healthy authority requirements. 
In Study DAL-PK-02, 8 paediatric participants were enrolled and received dalbavancin (single dose of 
22.5 mg/kg dalbavancin as a 30-minute IV infusion): 6 participants in Cohort 1 (young infants aged > 28 
days to < 3 months) and 1 participant each in Cohort 2 (term neonates [defined as gestational age ≥ 37 
weeks] aged ≤ 28 days) and Cohort 3 (preterm neonates [defined as gestational age ≥ 32 to < 37 weeks] 
aged ≤ 28 days). 
In Study A8841004, 10 paediatric participants from 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled and received a 
single dose of 1000 mg dalbavancin (participants weighing ≥ 60 kg; n = 5) or 15 mg/kg for (participants 
weighing < 60 kg, n = 5); the dose was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion. 
In Study DUR001-106, 34 paediatric participants received treatment. Participants in this study were 
enrolled and evaluated in 3 age cohorts: Cohort 1 (6 to 11 years of age; n = 11), Cohort 2 (2 to < 6 
years of age; n = 12), and Cohort 3 (3 months to < 2 years of age; n = 11). The planned dalbavancin 
doses were 15 mg/kg (not to exceed the adult dose of 1000 mg) for participants ≥ 5 years of age, and 25 
mg/kg for participants < 5 years of age, administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on Study Day 1. After 
an interim PK analysis, the dosage for Cohort 3 (3 months to < 2 years of age) was reduced to 10 mg/kg.

Adverse events 
DUR001-306 
Eight (8.9%) participants in the dalbavancin single-dose arm, 7 (9.0%) in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm, 
and 1 (3.3%) in the comparator arm experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). TEAEs 
that occurred in more than 1 participant overall were pyrexia and cough (each in 2 participants in the 
dalbavancin 2-dose arm), nasopharyngitis (1 participant in the dalbavancin single-dose arm and 1 in the 
comparator arm), and postoperative anaemia (1 participant in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm and 1 in the 
comparator arm). No treatment-related TEAEs were reported in the study. Most TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity. Three SAEs were reported, all in the dalbavancin single-dose arm of which none 
were considered treatment-related.  
DAL-PK-02 
In total, 36 AEs were reported during the study; 35/36 were TEAEs. Six participants had TEAEs, all in 
Cohort 1. No TEAEs were reported in Cohorts 2 and 3. The most commonly reported TEAEs in DAL-PK-02 
were pyrexia (3 [37.5%] participants) and procedural pain (2 [25.0%] participants); all in Cohort 1. All 
other TEAEs were reported as single instances. 
A8841004 
In study A8841004 which enrolled paediatric subjects aged from 12 to 17 years, headache, experienced 
by 1 participant in each dose group, was the only AE to be experienced by more than 1 participant. All 
other TEAEs in both groups were reported as single instances. 
DUR001-106 
In total, 39 AEs were reported during the study; 36/39 were TEAEs. There was a total of 9 TEAEs in 
Cohort 1, 23 in Cohort 2, and 4 in Cohort 3, occurring in 6 (54.4%), 9 (75.0%), and 4 (36.4%) 
participants, respectively. The following TEAEs were reported in 2 participants across all cohorts in Study 
DUR001-106: acoustic stimulation tests abnormal; acute respiratory failure; audiogram abnormal, 
dermatitis diaper; and pruritus. All other TEAEs in all cohorts were reported as single instances. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the DUR001-306, DAL-PK-02, A8841004, or DUR001-106 studies. 
SAEs 
Three treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in Study DUR001-306, all in the dalbavancin single-dose 
arm (bacterial abscess, febrile convulsion and bacterial osteomyelitis) which all recovered/resolved and 
were considered unrelated to study intervention. 
In study DAL-PK-02, one participant experienced treatment-emergent SAEs (necrotizing colitis and 
hydrocephalus). The SAE of necrotizing enterocolitis was reported as resolved and considered unrelated 
to dalbavancin as the participant had a history of pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal ultrasound prior 
to dalbavancin administration. The SAE of hydrocephalus was ongoing at the time of the final report and 
was considered by the investigator as unrelated to dalbavancin as the participant had a history of 
ventriculomegaly and severe meningitis/ventriculitis. 
In study A8841004, one SAE, mild ileus, was reported from 1 participant in the 15 mg/kg group. This SAE 
was considered by the investigator to be related to complications following an intra-abdominal abscess 
and not related to treatment. The participant recovered the day after onset of the event.

In study DUR001-106, five participants had SAEs (abdominal pain, arthralgia, device-related sepsis, 
abdominal abscess and acute respiratory failure) which all recovered/resolved and were considered 
unrelated to study intervention. 
Other significant events 
Audiologic testing has been conducted in a total of 18 participants in study DUR001-306 (1 in the 3-
month to < 2-year cohort; 6 in the 2-year to < 6-year cohort; 4 in the 6-year to < 12-year cohort; 7 in 
the 12-year to 17-year cohort). Of the 18 participants, 14 received dalbavancin and 4 received 
comparator (3 in the 6-year to <12-year cohort and 1 in the 12-year to 17-year cohort). Review of the 
audiology parameters at baseline and Day 28 in all participants (overall and by age cohort) showed no 
evident signal of ototoxicity and test results at Day 28 remained within the clinically normal range. No 
bone conduction tests needed to be performed. 
Audiology testing was performed in 8 participants aged birth to <3 months in study DAL-PK-02 Due to 
the age and underlying illness of participants in the study, audiology testing was difficult to perform and 
interpret in the cohorts that were studied. Despite these limitations, there was no evidence of ototoxicity 
due to dalbavancin in participants for whom results were obtained and evaluable. 
In study DUR001-106, audiology testing was performed in 34 participants (11 in the 3-month to <2-year 
cohort, 12 in the 2-year to <6-year cohort; 11 in the 6-year to <12-year cohort). Of the 34 participants, 
21 (62%) had no evidence of ototoxicity due to dalbavancin and in 13 (38%) ototoxicity due to 
dalbavancin could not be determined. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory changes reported in DUR001-306 were consistent with the reduction in systemic immune 
response. There were no clinically significant mean changes in other laboratory parameters or vital signs. 
Overall, in the paediatric studies there were very few and isolated potentially clinically significant changes 
in clinical laboratory values.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention in any of the studies. 
Post marketing experience 
The cumulative number of vials distributed/sold of dalbavancin worldwide through 21 June 2021 is 
523,769. This equates to an estimated post-authorization exposure of approximately 174,590 adult 
patients cumulatively. 
The adverse reactions identified based on post marketing experience include hypersensitivity (including 
angioedema as a manifestation), anaphylactic reaction, and back pain (symptom of infusion-related 
reactions). Back pain occurred during dalbavancin IV infusion and resolved when the infusion was slowed 
down or discontinued, with no residual sequela.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Studies contributing paediatric safety data are the Phase 3 study DUR001-306 and the Phase 1 studies 
DAL-PK-02, A8841004 and DUR001-106. Safety data were reported separately for the respective studies 
which is acceptable. 
In Study DUR001-306, 198 participants were enrolled as of 21 June 2021, including 90 in the dalbavancin 
single-dose arm and 78 in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm. The proposed paediatric dosing provides slightly 
lower but largely overlapping exposure as in adults. Thus, from a safety perspective, similar or slightly 
lower exposure is not a concern. In Study DAL-PK-02, 8 paediatric participants were enrolled and 
received dalbavancin (single dose of 22.5 mg/kg dalbavancin): 6 participants in Cohort 1 (young infants 
aged > 28 days to < 3 months) and 1 participant each in Cohort 2 (term neonates [defined as gestational 
age ≥ 37 weeks] aged ≤ 28 days) and Cohort 3 (preterm neonates [defined as gestational age ≥ 32 to < 
37 weeks] aged ≤ 28 days). In Study A8841004, 10 paediatric participants from 12 to 17 years of age 
were enrolled and received a single dose of 1000 mg dalbavancin (participants weighing ≥ 60 kg; n = 5) 
or 15 mg/kg for (participants weighing < 60 kg, n = 5). In Study DUR001-106, 34 paediatric participants 
received treatment. Participants in this study were enrolled and evaluated in 3 age cohorts: Cohort 1 (6 
to 11 years of age; n = 11), Cohort 2 (2 to < 6 years of age; n = 12), and Cohort 3 (3 months to < 2 
years of age; n = 11). The planned dalbavancin doses were 15 mg/kg (not to exceed the adult dose of 
1000 mg) for participants ≥ 5 years of age, and 25 mg/kg for participants < 5 years of age. After an 
interim PK analysis, the dosage for Cohort 3 (3 months to < 2 years of age) was reduced to 10 mg/kg. 
In study DUR001-306 dalbavancin received as a single or repeat intravenous infusion was generally well 
tolerated. 
Overall safety findings from the DAL-PK-02, A8841004, and DUR001-106 studies were consistent with 
that reported for DUR001-306. 
In summary, no new risks were identified as compared to the safety profile established in adults. It 
should be noted that the paediatric safety database, although acceptable, is of limited size to detect 
adverse reactions that are uncommon or rare. Overall, there were no findings needing to be reflected in 
the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Dalbavancin administered as a single dose or two doses one-week apart resulting in an exposure 
essentially similar to that in adults was generally well tolerated and safe. No new risks were identified. 
There was no indication that the safety profile in the paediatric population would be different from that 
established in adults. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application (Version 7.0), the following sections 
were updated: 
- Module SI with Xydalba indication in paediatric (aged 3 months and older) patients for the treatment of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 29/38 
 
 
 
 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Also, prevalence of target population, 
demographic profile of target population, potential health risks in paediatric patients were updated. 
Information about important co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, decreased renal function) in paediatric 
patients was also updated. 
- Module SIII was updated with the latest overall clinical trial exposure numbers (exposure number 
updated from 3097 to 3123 persons) and also in paediatric population. 
- Module SIV was updated with the frequency of adverse events seen in the studies DUR001-306, DAL-
PK-02 and A8841004. 
- Module SV was updated with the latest estimated post-authorisation exposure numbers (cumulative 
estimates calculated to 21 June 2021). Based on these sales data, an estimated 523,769 vials were 
distributed cumulatively, which the MAH has equated to be 174,589 patients exposed. 
- Module SVII was updated with the information about three phase 1 completed studies (DUR001-106, 
DUR001-109 and DUR001-303) and with the latest post-marketing experience data, as summarised 
below.  
The MAH did not propose changes to the Safety Specification. There are no new or removed safety 
concerns or reclassification of safety concerns during this RMP revision period. With this submission, no 
changes to PhV activities or risk minimisations are proposed. 
Safety concerns 
Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and missing information 
Since the DLP of the Integrated Safety Summary (01 April 2015) three phase 1 studies were completed 
(DUR001-106, DUR001-109 and DUR001-303). No new signals have emerged from these trials. No 
related SAEs, SAEs pertaining to the important risks, or new signals emerged from the paediatric trials 
(DUR001-306, DAL-PK-02, A8841004 and DUR001-106). 
Important Identified Risk 
Emergence of resistance 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 56 postmarketing cases which met search criteria for the 
important identified risk emergence of resistance. Of these 56 cases, 14 were considered serious. The 
case level outcomes of these serious cases were Unknown (6), Fatal (4), NA (3), and Recovered (1). To 
date, none of these cases were indicative of emergence of resistance (due to either not reporting any 
culture or microbiology information or dalbavancin being used for an unapproved indication in which 
potential resistance cannot be assessed. 
Pseudomembranous colitis 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 2 postmarketing cases reporting Pseudomembranous colitis. 
Of these 2 cases, 1 case was assessed as serious and the case level outcome was Recovered (1). 
Hypersensitivity 
Cumulatively until the DLP there have been 199 postmarketing cases reporting Hypersensitivity. Of these 
199 cases, 74 cases were assessed as serious. The case level outcomes of these serious cases were 
Recovered (37), Unknown (19), Improved (9), On-Going (4), Recovered without sequelae (3), NA (1), 
and Recovered with sequelae (1).

Important Potential Risk 
Hepatic disorders 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 10 postmarketing cases reporting Hepatic disorder. Of these 
10 cases, 7 cases were assessed as serious. The case level outcomes of these serious cases were 
Unknown (2), Improved (2), Recovered (1), Fatal (1), and On-Going (1). 
Otovestibular toxicity 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 2 postmarketing cases reporting Otovestibular toxicity. There 
were no cases that were assessed as serious. 
Otovestibular toxicity data was collected in the paediatric study DUR001-306. Audiologic testing has been 
conducted in a total of 18 children (1 in the birth to <3-months; 6 in the 2-year to <6-year cohort; 4 in 
the 6-year to <12-year cohort; 7 in the 12-year to 17-year cohort). Review of the audiology parameters 
at baseline and Day 28 in all tested subjects (overall and by age cohort) showed no evident signal of 
ototoxicity and test results at Day 28 remained within the clinically normal range. No bone conduction 
tests needed to be performed. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 19 postmarketing cases reporting Nephrotoxicity. Of these 
19 cases, 16 cases were assessed as serious. The case level outcomes of these serious cases were 
Unknown (7), Improved (3), On-Going (2), NA (1), Recovered without sequelae (1), Fatal (1), and 
Recovered (1). 
Haematologic Effects 
Cumulatively until the DLP, there have been 26 postmarketing cases reporting Haematologic effects. Of 
these 26 cases, 19 cases were assessed as serious. The case level outcomes of these serious cases were 
Unknown (6), On-Going (5), Recovered (4), Worsened (2), and Improved (2). 
Missing information 
Paediatric use 
Children less than 18 years of age were not included in the adult clinical programme with the exception of 
two 16 year old subjects who were enrolled in VER001-4 trial. A paediatric investigation plan was agreed 
with the PDCO to assess ABSSSI in paediatrics prior to obtaining the marketing authorization in Europe. 
Ten adolescents age 12 to 16 years old were enrolled in the PK study A8841004, and 34 patients age 3 
months to 11 years old were enrolled in study DUR001-106. Eight patients (neonates to infants <3 
months) with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection were enrolled in PK study DAL-PK-02. A total of 
198 patients with ABSSSI from birth to age <18 years old were enrolled in Study DUR001-306. 
Overall in Study DUR001-306, a low proportion of subjects experienced a TEAE (8.9% of subjects in 
dalbavancin single-dose arm, 9.0% of subjects in the dalbavancin two-dose arm, and 3.3% of subjects in 
the comparator arm). There were no treatment-related SAEs, no treatment-related TEAEs, no TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study intervention or study, and no SAEs leading to death in the dalbavancin 
single-dose or 2-dose arms. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. There was no notable 
difference in safety across age cohorts. Overall safety findings from the DAL-PK-02, A8841004, and 
DUR001-106 studies were consistent with that reported for DUR001-306. 
The safety and efficacy of dalbavancin for the treatment of ABSSSI has been established in paediatric 
patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years. Use of dalbavancin for this indication is supported by 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023

evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety 
data from paediatric patients. 
The recommended dose of dalbavancin in paediatric patients with ABSSSI with creatinine clearance of 30 
ml/min/1.73m2 and above is a single-dose regimen based on the age and weight of the paediatric patient, 
administered as a single infusion. 
According to the MAH, the safety and efficacy of dalbavancin in children aged < 3 months old have not 
yet been established, therefore, no recommendation on a posology can be made.

The MAH has updated the RMP to version 7.1 during this procedure to address a difference in the number 
of cases included for the PT Cellulitis and for the cases of otovestibular toxicity. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
Risk minimisation measures 
There are no ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities to characterize these risks further. 
Moreover, there are no ongoing additional risk minimisation measures for any of the safety concerns. 
Routine risk minimisation measures are considered sufficient to manage these concerns. 
Changes to the SmPC were agreed with this application, which adequately reflect the data submitted with 
the application. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.6 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guidelines and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend some of the contact 
details.

2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Xydalba. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
ABSSSI is a bacterial infection of the skin and skin structures and includes major cutaneous abscesses, 
wound infection and cellulitis/erysipelas. The most common causative pathogens are Staphylococcus 
aureus and various types of streptococci such as beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G. 
ABSSSI are among the most common infections seen in clinical practice in adults and in children. These 
infections may require systemic antibacterial therapy, surgical management and hospitalisation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is a need for making new antibacterial agents available also to the paediatric population that will 
effectively treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria including resistant pathogens such as 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study DUR001-306 is an ongoing phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised, comparator-controlled 
trial of the safety and efficacy of dalbavancin versus active comparator in paediatric subjects with 
ABSSSI. The study continues to enrol participants in Cohort 5 (from birth to < 3 months) to satisfy 
European health authority requirements; currently 198 participants have enrolled. The study included 
paediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age with ABSSSI suspected or confirmed to be caused by 
Gram-positive bacteria. A clinical picture of suspected or confirmed sepsis was also acceptable for Cohort 
5. 
The study compared single dose of IV dalbavancin or two doses of IV dalbavancin administered 1 week 
apart with a 10-to-14-day course of IV vancomycin (for infections caused by methicillin-resistant 
bacteria) or IV oxacillin or flucloxacillin (for infections caused by methicillin-susceptible bacteria) with an 
option to switch to oral treatment (cefadroxil or clindamycin) after at least 72 h of study drug treatment if 
they met criteria for oral therapy. 
Efficacy objectives and endpoints were secondary and descriptive in nature as the application relies on 
the concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety based on comparable plasma exposures in 
children to those in adults. The acceptance of extrapolation is based on assumptions that the disease, 
mechanism of action and thus PK/PD are the same in paediatric patients as in adults and therefore the 
doses selected should achieve similar plasma exposures and probability of PK/PD target attainment (PTA) 
in children as in adults.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The proposed paediatric dosing provides slightly lower but largely overlapping exposure as in adults. The 
MAH discussed that the slightly lower exposure is not clinically relevant with regards to efficacy based on 
probability of target attainment analyses (PTA). This was accepted. 
The clinical response rates at 48-72 hours were 96.4% (81/84), 98.6% (73/74) and 89.7% (26/29) in the 
dalbavancin single-dose, dalbavancin two-dose and comparator groups, respectively (mITT Population, 
i.e. all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had a diagnosis of 
ABSSSI, or a suspected or confirmed sepsis for Cohort 5, not known to be caused exclusively by a Gram-
negative organism). At the TOC visit the response rates were above 90% in all treatment groups (95.1%, 
97.3% and 100.0%, respectively). The response rates were essentially unchanged at the follow-up visit 
compared with at TOC. 
Clinical response rates by baseline pathogen and microbiological response rates (generally presumed 
eradication based on lack of follow-up cultures) at different time-points and for different analysis 
populations were generally in line with the clinical response rates. There have been no deaths in the 
study to date. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary objectives of the Phase 3 study were to evaluate PK and safety of dalbavancin in the 
paediatric population. Hence, the study was not powered for a statistical analysis of efficacy and of limited 
size. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Studies contributing to paediatric safety data are the Phase 3 study DUR001-306 and the Phase 1 studies 
DAL-PK-02, A8841004 and DUR001-106. Safety data were reported separately for the respective studies 
which is acceptable. 
In Study DUR001-306, 198 participants were enrolled, including 90 in the dalbavancin single-dose arm 
and 78 in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm. The proposed paediatric dosing provides slightly lower but largely 
overlapping exposure as in adults. Thus, from a safety perspective, similar or slightly lower exposure is 
not a concern. 
In study DUR001-306 dalbavancin received as a single or repeat intravenous infusion was generally well 
tolerated. Overall, 8 (8.9%) participants in the dalbavancin single-dose arm, 7 (9.0%) in the dalbavancin 
2-dose arm, and 1 (3.3%) in the comparator arm experienced a TEAE. TEAEs that occurred in more than 
1 participant overall were pyrexia and cough (each in 2 participants in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm), 
nasopharyngitis (1 participant in the dalbavancin single-dose arm and 1 in the comparator arm), and 
postoperative anaemia (1 participant in the dalbavancin 2-dose arm and 1 in the comparator arm). No 
treatment-related TEAEs were reported in the study. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Three SAEs were reported, all in the dalbavancin single-dose arm of which none were considered 
treatment-related. There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention or study, and no 
SAEs leading to death. Laboratory changes and vital signs were consistent with the reduction in systemic 
immune response. There were no clinically significant mean changes in other laboratory parameters or 
vital signs. Audiologic testing did not reveal any signal of ototoxicity. 
Overall, safety findings from the Phase 1 studies DAL-PK-02, A8841004, and DUR001-106 were 
consistent with that reported for DUR001-306.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

are uncommon or rare.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
This extension of indication application to include the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 
years) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) relied on the 
concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety based on comparable plasma exposures in children 
to those in adults. The approved dose in paediatric patients aged from 6 years to less than 18 years is a 
single dose of 18 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg) and in paediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 
6 years a single dose of 22.5 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg). 
No dose reduction is recommended in mild or moderate renal impairment whereas there is according to 
the MAH insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustment for patients younger than 18 years 
with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The MAH elaborated on a dosing recommendation 
at least for a subset of the paediatric population with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 
and provided simulations results indicating a dose reduction of 25-33% in paediatric patients with severe 
renal impairment (similar to adults). However, given the lack of data in paediatric patients with severe 
renal impairment, the MAH believed there was insufficient information to recommend a dose regimen for 
paediatric patients in any age group with CrCL < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The MAHs reasoning was accepted, 
and the following recommendation was added to section 4.2 of the SmPC for paediatric patients with 
renal impairment: “There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustment for patients 
younger than 18 years with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Currently available 
information is described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.” The PL was 
updated accordingly. Information regarding the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin in paediatric patients 
was added to section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
The MAH did not propose to include the alternative two-dose regimen for the paediatric population in the 
SmPC which was accepted as there is no added benefit of having the option of using a two-dose regimen. 
Based on essentially similar exposure in the paediatric population as in adults and satisfactory PTA it is 
anticipated that the recommended paediatric doses will be effective and safe in the paediatric population. 
Clinical response rates in the paediatric ABSSSI study DUR001-306 were numerically comparable in 
dalbavancin single-dose, dalbavancin two-dose and comparator groups, respectively, and moreover in 
line with the response rates in the adult study DUR001-303. 
Dalbavancin administered as a single dose or two doses one-week apart, resulting in an exposure 
essentially similar to that in adults was generally safe and well tolerated. No new risks were identified. 
There was no indication that the safety profile in the paediatric population would be different from that 
established in adults. 
Regarding the claim for an additional year of market protection submitted by the MAH, data supporting 
the clinical benefits of dalbavancin for the treatment of paediatric patients with ABSSSI from the Phase 3 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/249855/2023 
Page 36/38 
 
 
 
 
study DUR001-306 demonstrated favourable clinical and microbiological response rates across all 
participants regardless of dalbavancin dose regimens or age cohorts and did not vary significantly versus 
comparator treatments (IV vancomycin, oxacillin, or flucloxacillin). Consistent with that reported in 
adults, safety and tolerability were acceptable and comparable to comparator treatments overall across 
age and dose. No compound-specific or unique toxicity was identified, and, overall, the duration of AEs 
was similar to that of comparators. The pharmacokinetic properties of dalbavancin, allowing for a single-
dose regimen, are considered of significant clinical benefit because of the reduced dosing frequency 
allowing a single-dose regimen compared with existing therapies for which repeated administration for 
several days is necessary. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risk for the extension of indication of treatment of ABSSSI to include 
paediatric patients aged 3 months and older is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xydalba is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considered the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommended, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of indication to the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 years) for the treatment of 
ABSSSI based on the interim results from the safety and efficacy Phase 3 Study DUR001-306, together 
with data from three Phase 1 PK studies (A8841004, DUR001-106, and DAL-PK-02). Consequently, the 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC were updated. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments and QRD updates 
(v10.2) to the SmPC/PL. 
Version 7.1 of the RMP has also been approved. 
The MAH also requested 1 year of market protection for a new indication (Article 14(11) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004).

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP P/0522/2021 (and subsequent modifications thereof) and the results of these 
studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package 
Leaflet. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine is a serious, chronic, disabling neurological disease characterised by attacks of moderate to 
severe headache (HA) pain associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, 
and phonophobia. Migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully 
treated. People with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Migraine is a highly prevalent disease, occurring in 11% to 12% of people in Europe, with higher rates 
among women (16% to 18%) than men (6% to 7%) (Goadsby et al. 2002). The disease is particularly 
common among individuals between the ages of 25 and 55 years. Migraine has been reported to be the 
second highest cause of years lived with disability, interfering significantly with occupational, educational, 
household, family, and social responsibilities (GBD 2017). Because of intense pain and other burdensome 
symptoms including photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting (Linde and Dahlöf 2004; Ford et 
al. 2017), patients with migraine report extensive limitations in life activities (Leonardi et al. 2010). 
People with migraine have higher lifetime rates of comorbid depression, anxiety, panic disorder, sleep 
disturbances, chronic pain syndromes, and suicide attempts (Buse et al. 2009; MRF 2017). They are also 
at higher risk for ischaemic stroke and other cardiovascular diseases (Blumenfeld et al. 2011; Sacco and 
Kurth 2014). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
It is currently thought that migraine has a neurologic aetiology (Goadsby et al. 2002; Goadsby 2009; 
Amin  et  al.  2013).  The  brains  of  patients  with  migraine  are  characterised  by  a  generalised  neuronal 
hyperexcitability, evidenced by increased response to visual, sensory, auditory, and nociceptive stimuli, 
and migraine attacks involve release of neurotransmitters and activation of pain pathways, including the 
trigeminal nerve (Xavier et al. 2017; Dodick 2018). Migraine pain appears to involve nociceptive neurons 
in the dura mater being stimulated and releasing vasoactive neuropeptides such as CGRP. The trigeminal 
nerve pathway transmits nociception from the meninges via intermediate pathways to the cortex.  
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 9/136 
 
  
 
 
 
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that modulates nociceptive signalling and 
causes vasodilation that has been associated with migraine pathophysiology. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Standard  diagnostic  criteria  are  based  the  International  Classification  of  Headache  Disorders  (ICHD-3 
beta version). They have been developed by the Headache Classification Committee of the International 
Headache Society (IHS).  
Migraine without aura (1.1) is described as recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 
4-72 hours. Typical characteristics of the HA are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe 
intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity and association with nausea and/or photophobia and 
phonophobia. For a firm diagnosis to be established, the patient has to present with at least five attacks, 
that fulfil a list of respective criteria. As opposed to episodic forms of migraine, chronic migraine (Code 
1.3) requires headache to occur on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, which has the 
features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month. 
2.1.5.  Management 
A Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Migraine was released by 
the EMA in 2007. Further guidance is obtained from the International Headache Society that issued two 
guidance documents for preventive treatment of migraine attacks: The first one for preventive treatment 
in CM patients (Tassorelli et al, 2018) and the second one for preventive treatment in EM patients (Diener 
HC et al. 2020). 
Currently approved preventive treatment options include anticonvulsant topiramate (e.g., Topamax), ß-
blockers like metoprolol or propranolol, Botox, CGRP antagonist biologics (Aimovig, Ajovy, and Emgality), 
and most recently, another orally administered CGRP antagonist (rimegepant, Vydura), which has been 
approved  for  preventive  treatment  of  EM  in  adults.  Botox  (botulinum  toxin  type  A  from  Clostridium 
botulinum) is indicated in the EU for prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine (headaches 
on at least 15 days per month of which at least 8 days are with migraine). Preventive treatment of CM 
with Botox requires multiple bilateral intramuscular injections divided across 7 specific head and neck 
muscle areas, with a recommended retreatment schedule of every 12 weeks. All three antibodies (ABs) 
are  indicated  in  the  EU  for  prophylaxis  of  migraine  in  adults  who  have  at  least  4  migraine  days  per 
month. 
Although forming the mainstay of current preventive migraine therapy, these options are not optimal for 
many patients due to limited effectiveness, poor tolerability, contraindications, and the need for dose 
titration over multiple visits for some medications. 
Several epidemiological surveys indicate that available migraine preventive treatments are significantly 
underutilised  in  clinical  practice  (D’Amico  et  al.  2006),  which  supports  the  need  for  greater  dialogue 
concerning migraine prevention between patients and physicians. Given the pharmacological profile of 
available per oral preventive medications (topiramate, ß-blockers), the choice of treatment should be 
based on the presence of comorbid and coexisting illness in order to improve compliance and minimise 
side  effects  (Silberstein  2015).  However,  compliance  with  preventive  treatment  remains  a  challenge. 
Low adherence to migraine prophylaxis treatment with antidepressants, antiepileptics, or beta blockers 
at 6 month follow-up was reported (Berger et al. 2012).

2.2.  About the product 
Atogepant (AGN-241689, MK-8031, L-004880174, AGP) is presented as a selective, high-affinity, orally 
administered, small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.  
Calcitonin gene-related peptide is an endogenous 37 amino acid peptide contained within pain-signalling 
nociceptive afferents, and is thought to play a causal role in migraine (Edvinsson 2018, Moreno-Ajona 
2020). Multiple lines of clinical evidence point to a role for CGRP in migraine pathophysiology: 1) serum 
levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine; 2) treatment with anti-migraine drugs returns CGRP levels 
to  normal  coincident  with  pain  relief;  and  3)  intravenous  (IV)  CGRP  infusion  produces  lasting  pain  in 
non-migraineurs and migraineurs. 
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is thought to relieve migraine by: 1) blocking CGRP-induced 
neurogenic  vasodilation  (returning  dilated  intracranial  arteries  to  normal);  2)  halting  the  cascade  of 
CGRP-induced neurogenic inflammation (which leads to peripheral and central sensitisation); and/or 3) 
inhibiting  the  central  relay  of  pain  signals  from  the trigeminal  nerve  to  the  caudal  trigeminal  nucleus 
(Durham 2004). 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application.

succinate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium chloride, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silicon 
dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate.   
The product is available in aluminium foil and PVC/PE/PCTFE blisters.   
Active substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  atogepant  is  (3'S)-N-[(3S,5S,6R)-6-methyl-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-5-
(2,3,6-trifluorophenyl)piperidin-3-yl]-2'-oxo-1',2',5,7-tetrahydrospiro[cyclopenta 
[b]pyridine-6,3'-
pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-3-carboxamide  hydrate  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C29H23F6N5O3 
●H2O. It has a molecular weight of 621.544 g/mol as monohydrate form and the following structure: 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 11/136 
 
  
 
 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of atogepant was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic methods, including 
UV-VIS, Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 
19F-NMR) and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).  
The active substance appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic powder. Atogepant is freely soluble 
in Ethanol, soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in acetonitrile and insoluble 
in water. Its partition coefficient (LogP) was determined to be 2.4 and two pKa values were determined 
to be pKa1= 2.2 (pyridinium group) and pKa2= 10.2 (lactam group). 
Atogepant has four chiral centres and is manufactured as a single stereoisomer. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and achiral HPCL methods at intermediate stage and at release. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were determined by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). XRPD results confirmed 
that atogepant is present in crystalline monohydrate form.  
Comprehensive screening studies for polymorphs, salts, co-crystals were conducted for Atogepant. In 
free-base  form,  a  monohydrate,  a  trihydrate,  and  a  few  solvates  (ethyl  acetate,  chloroform,  and 
methanol solvates) were obtained. No salt form was isolated for atogepant. The free-base monohydrate 
form was the more thermodynamically stable form of the two hydrates.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A single manufacturer for atogepant active substance is proposed. Atogepant is synthesised in  multiple 
steps process using two well-defined starting materials and with acceptable specifications.  
The starting materials initially proposed by the applicant were re-defined as intermediates following a 
MO raised to achieve appropriate control of the synthesis steps. As crucial part of the synthesis, these 
steps  were  placed  under  GMP  control.  Sufficient  information  regarding  their  synthesis  and  relevant 
impurities has been provided for all of them and they are considered acceptable and are controlled by 
suitable specifications as requested by the CHMP. 
Critical steps of the synthesis have been described and sufficient in process controls are applied. Control 
of  critical  steps  comprises  an  updated  critical  process  parameter  study,  based  on  which  specific 
operational parameters are defined. The manufacturing process and the control strategy is described in 
sufficient detail. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

Impurity limits are justified based on spike/purge studies. Absence of controls on individual impurities 
has been justified by results of spike/purge studies. The control strategy for residual solvents is justified; 
validated analytical methods are described. 
Potential  impurities  were  discussed  and  characterised,  including  organic  impurities  from  both  starting 
materials  as  well  as  formed  during  synthesis,  degradation  products,  inorganic  impurities  (elemental 
impurities), residual solvents, and nitrosamine impurities. Information on origin/formation of impurities, 
their  fate  and  control  strategies  was  included,  supported  by  historical  ranges,  and  control  strategies. 
Most  of  potential  process-related  impurities  are  purged  during  synthesis  as  supported  by  results  of 
spike/purge studies; only the Epimer impurity is included for routine control at NMT 0.20 %, which is 
accepted.   
The manufacturing process has evolved during the process development. The proposed manufacturing 
process is based on modifications of the original process. These modifications regard mainly the synthetic 
route for the spiroacid intermediate. As for the lactam salt intermediate and the final step, the overall 
synthetic  steps  have  remained  consistent.  During  development,  minor  changes  have  been  made  to 
reagents, solvents, and manufacturing conditions. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development programme.  
Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.  
The active substance is packaged in in double lined low-density polyethylene (LDPE) which complies with 
the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification (IR spectroscopy), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC-UV), related substances (HPLC-
UV), residual solvents (GC-FID), specific rotation (Ph. Eur), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur).  
The active substance specification is considered acceptable and has been set based on relevant guidelines 
and batch data. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were 
qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
A second method for identification of the active substance was requested to be included to the applicant 
along with single-crystal XRD for confirmation of absolute stereochemistry for identification of the chiral 
form, in line with ICH Q6A requirements. The applicant did not include a second method for identification 
and the justification provided was that identity is tested by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and since the IR 
test is specific, a second identification test is not needed per ICH Q6A. With respect to addition of single-
crystal XRD for confirmation of absolute stereochemistry for identification of the chiral form, the control 
of all the chiral centres by HPLC methods either at the intermediate stage or at the final active substance 
stage ensures the stereochemistry of atogepant molecule. In addition, the chiral identity of the active 
substance  is  confirmed  by  the  routine  specific  rotation  test  during  release  testing.  Therefore,  it  was 
considered  not  necessary  to  implement  a  single-crystal  XRD  test  as  a  routine  test  to  confirm  the 
stereochemistry. 
A detailed risk assessment on the potential presence and formation of nitrosamines during synthesis is 
provided  following  the  recommendations  of  EMA/CHMP/428592/2019  Rev.1.  The  risk  assessment 
includes the syntheses of re-defined starting material, all raw materials, equipment, process water and 
packaging materials, as well as potential cross-contamination. Though secondary and/or tertiary amines 
are  present  several  synthesis  stages,  the  risk  of  formation  of  nitrosamines  is  concluded  low  as  no 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 13/136 
 
  
 
 
 
nitrosating/oxidating  reagents  are  present  at  any  stage.  An  updated  genotoxic  risk  assessment  is 
provided for impurities introduced by the re-defined starting materials, other raw materials, synthesis 
intermediates, and synthesis by-products. The evaluation was performed according to ICH M7 using two 
complementary  statistical  models.  As  for  ICH  M7  Class  1-3  impurities,  the  proposed  Option  4  quality 
control strategy has been completed by new data on the required purge considering the TTC for lifetime 
use, and the calculated purge ratio. This approach is acceptable for impurities for which purge ratios with 
sufficient reliability were obtained. For several compounds with borderline purge ratio values, analytical 
results generated with commercial batches are provided, which confirmed the theoretical calculations. 
All  values  were  found  below  30 %  of  the  PDE  resp.  acceptable  limit  based  on  the  TTC.  The  Option  4 
approach for these borderline compounds has been justified. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 17 batches of varying batch size, including toxicological, clinical and stability 
batches, was provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  from  three  primary  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package in a container closure system representative 
of that intended for the market for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
A supportive batch was monitored on stability for 36 months at long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) 
and 6 months at accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH). Three additional supportive batches using the 
proposed commercial manufacturing process were monitored on stability for up to 60 months at 25ºC / 
60% RH and 6 months at 40ºC / 75% RH. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, specific 
rotation,  x-ray  powder  diffraction,  water  activity,  microbial  enumeration  test.  The  analytical  methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. A post-approval stability protocol was provided to 
continue on-going stability studies for the primary batches through the re-test period. Any confirmed 
out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on a primary stability batch. No 
significant degradation was observed; the results support the conclusion that the active substance does 
not need protection from light.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed 
container without specific storage conditions.

Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished medicinal product is an immediate release oral tablet, presented in two strengths, containing 
10 mg atogepant and 60 mg atogepant, respectively. The 10 mg strength is presented as a white to off-
white, round biconvex tablet with “A” and “10” debossed on one side. The 60 mg strength is presented 
as white to off-white, oval biconvex tablet with “A60” debossed on one side.  
Formulation development  
The  formulation  development  for  Atogepant  IR  oral  tablets  has  been  systematically  and  extensively 
addressed. 
The  choice  and  function  of  each  excipient  has  been  presented.  Compatibility  with  the  AS  has  been 
investigated and drove the selection of excipients. The formulation was amenable to manufacture via 
hot melt extrusion and direct compression. The finished product quality attributes were consistently met. 
Atogepant  is  categorised  as  a  Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System  (BCS)  II  molecule.  The  poor 
aqueous solubility of atogepant presented a great challenge for the development of conventional solid 
oral  tablet  formulations  with  desired  immediate  release  attributes.  Several  oral  formulations  (both 
solution  and  tablet  formulations)  were  explored.  Formulation  development  studies  were  conducted  to 
select  the  appropriate  excipients.  The  focus  was  to  achieve  immediate  release  tablets  with  excellent 
physical-chemical stability. Several experiments were conducted to understand the effect of polymers, 
surfactant levels, extrudate particle size distribution and disintegrants on finished product dissolution.  
The objective of the pharmaceutical development of the finished product was to produce a stable dosage 
form of atogepant of consistent quality containing 10mg or 60mg of atogepant.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards,  with  exception  of  vitamin  E  polyethylene  glycol  succinate  which  meets  USP/NF  quality 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The  history  of  formulations  used  for  clinical  studies  and  the  compositions  of  the  various  formulations 
used during development were presented and found acceptable. PK studies and in vitro studies informed 
formulation optimisation. Based on these studies the commercial formulation was determined 
Dissolution method development 
The development of the QC dissolution method has been sufficiently described. The proposed method is 
a compendial method (Ph. Eur. 2.9.3) using Apparatus 2 (Paddle) at 75 rpm rotation speed in 0.1 HCl. 
Specificity,  accuracy,  linearity,  range,  precision,  robustness  and  sample  solution  stability  were 
demonstrated.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
Information was requested through a raised MO for the dissolution limit set in the specifications. The 
specification limits for the dissolution testing was revised following the MO. The acceptance criterion for 
in-vitro  dissolution  at  release  was  set  to  NLT  Q  85  %  after  15  minutes  to  suitably  reflect  the 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 15/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
discriminatory  power  of  the  in-vitro  dissolution  method,  in  compliance  with  the  dissolution  method 
development report supplied.  
Manufacturing process development 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  was  designed  to  consistently  produce  finished  product 
meeting the criteria of the target product profile and finished product quality attributes of appearance, 
content  uniformity,  assay,  impurities/degradation  products,  active  substance  polymorphic  form, 
intermediate and finished product physical and chemical stability, identity and dissolution.  
 The manufacture of the proposed finished product consists of four main steps: pre-blending, hot melt 
extrusion (HME) and milling, final blending and tablet compression.  
The manufacturing process development studies were conducted to identify the key process parameter 
set points for unit operations including pre-blending, hot melt extrusion, milling, blending with extra-
granular  excipients  and  tablet  compression.  The  focus  was  to  achieve  intermediates  with  acceptable 
blend  uniformity,  content  uniformity,  extrudate  particle  size  distribution  and  finished  tablets  with 
immediate release properties, acceptable physical appearance and mechanical strength. 
A control strategy with the aim to mitigate risks during finished product manufacture was established, 
investigating e.g. the impact of raw materials and different machine settings in every single process step 
on the finished product CQAs, resulting in stipulating process parameter ranges for the commercial drug 
manufacture.  Risk  categorisation  along  with  respective  justification  are  provided  for  the  drug 
manufacturing steps extrusion, extrudate milling and tablet compression. 
In  summary,  the  pharmaceutical  development  is  sufficiently  discussed.  The  primary  packaging  is 
aluminium foil and PVC/PE/PCTFE blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been defined and are appropriately controlled. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Due  to  the  hot-melt  extrusion  step,  the  manufacturing  process  was  considered  non-standard  during 
assessment. Thus, process validation data of production scale batches were requested and a validation 
report has been submitted.  
Based  on  validation  data  provided,  the  overall  conclusion  was  that  the  manufacturing  process 
implemented at the intended finished product manufacturing site is regarded as capable of consistently 
producing the proposed finished product meeting the predefined specifications.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for physical 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC-UV),  assay  (HPLC-UV),  content  uniformity  (HPLC-UV), 
degradation products (HPLC-UV), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), microbial enumeration 
test (Ph. Eur.), test for specified microorganisms (Ph. Eur.). 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

The  specifications  are  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q6A.  Sufficient  information  on  control  of  the  finished 
product  has  been  provided.  The  parameter  specification  for  the  dissolution  testing  has  been  revised 
appropriately during the procedure. 
Possible  degradation  products  have  been  discussed  with  regard  to  the  impurity  profile  of  the  active 
substance. The possible degradation pathway of the finished product as well as on the test performed 
on elemental impurities have been sufficiently described. The mutagenicity of impurities with reference 
to the finished product has been sufficiently addressed. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  risk  assessment  for  elemental  impurities.  Batch  analysis  data  on  four 
representative batches of atogepant bulk tablets and six primary stability samples using a validated ICP-
MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30%  of  the  respective  PDE.  Based  on  the  risk  assessment  and  the  presented  batch  data  it  can  be 
concluded  that  it  is not  necessary  to  include  any  elemental  impurity  controls.  The  information  on  the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has  been  performed  (as  requested)  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the 
“Questions  and  answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the 
Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on 
the  information  provided,  it  is  accepted  that  there  is  no  risk  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine 
analysis of the finished product has been presented. 
The finished product is released on the market a) based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three primary stability batches, three phase 3 clinical batches and 
two  supportive  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches for the 10 mg strength and from three commercial scale 
batches for the 60 mg strength of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Also supportive stability data of Phase 3 clinical batches packaged in 
bottles have been presented.  The batches of the medicinal product are representative of those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  physical  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  microbial 
enumeration tests, water content, water activity, photostability study. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed. The observed physical and chemical 
changes were small, and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when 
used according to the directions in the SmPC. 
In addition, 1 batch per strength (10 mg and 60mg) was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline 
on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Productsto determine the effect of light exposure 
on  the  product  and  to  demonstrate  that  adequate  packaging  has  been  implemented  to  protect  the 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 17/136 
 
  
 
 
product  from  photo  damage.  Results  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products  and  dissolution 
remained practically unchanged. Based on the results, atogepant tablets are considered inherently photo 
stable in the proposed packaging under normal use conditions.  
Thermal cycling study was performed for the finished product. The packaged tablets were exposed to 
three complete cycles of low and high temperature conditions. All test results are comparable to those 
of the controls and were within specifications. No adverse effects on the product quality were observed 
as  a  result  of  the  exposure  to  the  low  and  high  temperature  cycling  conditions.  Based  on  available 
stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  major  objection  (MO)  raised  during  the  procedure 
regarding the selection of the starting materials for the active substance synthesis and the nitrosamine 
impurities risk assessment have been resolved by provision of the requested data and information. 
The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
Recommendations for future quality development   
None.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  testing  strategy  was  developed to  support  the  proposed  indication. In  support of  the 
atogepant investigation in human subjects, a series of non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and 
toxicology studies have been conducted.  
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 18/136 
 
  
 
 
 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
In  in  vitro  binding  experiments,  atogepant  shows  high  affinity  to  the  native  and  recombinant  human 
CGRP receptor (Ki 16 - 26 pM). However, there are marked interspecies differences. Whereas atogepant 
shows  also  high  affinity  to  the  rhesus  monkey  CGRP  receptor  (Ki  9  pM),  affinity  to  the  mice,  rat  and 
rabbit CGRP receptor is considerably lower (Ki values of 130, 700 and 2100 pM, respectively). 
In in vitro functional studies, it could be shown that atogepant is an inhibitor of αCGRP-induced cAMP 
response in HEK293 cells, expressing the human or rhesus monkey CGRP receptor, with an IC50 of 30 
and 50 pM, respectively.  
In isolated coronary, meningeal and cerebral artery segments, atogepant inhibited the vasodilatory effect 
of  αCGRP.  In  contrary  to  the  triptan  zolmitriptan,  atogepant  had  no  own  vasoconstrictive  effects. 
However, whereas in distal coronary artery segments the inhibitory effect of atogepant was apparently 
competitive in nature (right shift of the αCGRP dose response curve, no decrease in maximal effect) with 
a pKb of 9.4 to 8.4, in middle meningeal and cerebral artery segments, atogepant antagonised the αCGRP 
effect  apparently  in  a  non-competitive  manner  (reduction  of  αCGRP´s  Emax,  without  affecting  its 
potency). 
These results suggest that the vasodilatory effects of CGRP in distal coronary artery segments on one 
and  on  middle  meningeal  and  cerebral  artery  segments  on  the  other  hand  are  mediated  by  different 
receptors and that more than one receptor type is involved in the antagonistic effects of atogepant (see 
“Discussion on non-clinical aspects”). 
In vivo 
A  specific  animal  model  for  the  evaluation  of  prophylactic  effects  of  atogepant  on  migraine  was  not 
provided by the applicant. As a surrogate pharmacological parameter for clinical efficacy of atogepant in 
the  prophylaxis  of  migraine,  inhibition  of  capsaicin-induced  dermal  vasodilatation  (CIDV),  an  effect 
considered to be mediated largely by release of CGRP, was used by the applicant.  
Species-differences are obvious for functional activity of atogepant in vivo. CIDV in the forearm of rhesus 
monkeys was inhibited by atogepant in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of about 1 nM. 
In a CIDV assay in rats, a plasma concentration of 3.7 µM resulted in 47% inhibition of dermal blood 
flow (Report PD003). In a rabbit CIDV assay, a plasma concentration of 41 µM was associated with a 
43% inhibition of dermal blood flow (Report PD003). For humans, an IC50 for inhibition of CIDV of 1.5 
nM was reported (Study CGP-PK-04). 
Overall, these in vivo studies confirm the existence of large (for the CIDV response more than 1000 fold) 
interspecies differences.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In an in vitro screening assay, atogepant showed no appreciable affinity (IC50 > 10 µM) to a broad panel 
of human drug receptors and drug transporters. 
However, atogepant showed antagonistic activity at the human amylin 1 and adrenomedullin 2 receptor, 
members of the calcitonin/CGRP receptor family, in the low (IC50 2.4 nM) respectively high (IC50 400 nM) 
nanomolar range. Since total atogepant plasma concentrations for the 60 mg clinical dose amount to 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 19/136 
 
  
 
 
about 1.2 µM, with free (unbound) atogepant plasma concentrations of about 60 nM, affinity to these 
additional receptors could be of clinical relevance (see “Discussion on non-clinical aspects”). 
Atogepant attenuated CGRP-induced decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate in rhesus 
monkeys (IC50 about 1.1 nM). 
In an in vivo PET assay with [11C]atogepant in rhesus monkeys, atogepant (in plasma levels up to 229 
nM)  showed  low  (about  25%)  brain  CGRP  receptor  occupancy,  suggesting  that  atogepant  does  not 
penetrate the blood brain barrier well (see also “Distribution”).  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular / respiratory function 
In vitro 
In an electrophysiological evaluation on hERG channels, stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells, using standard 
whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques, atogepant exhibited weak hERG current inhibition (23.9% inhibition 
at  28  µM),  which  suggests  that  atogepant  is  unlikely  to  alter  ventricular  repolarisation  in  humans  at 
clinically effective doses. 
In vivo 
Atogepant had no prominent in vivo effects on cardiovascular parameters in guinea pigs, rats and rhesus 
monkeys: 
-  In  a  rat  telemetry  study,  there  were  no  effects  on  any  haemodynamic  parameter  after  single-dose 
treatment with doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg. 
- In an exploratory cardiovascular study in anaesthetised guinea pigs, there were no test-article related 
effects  on  HR,  PR  interval,  QRS  interval,  or  QT/QTcB  intervals  up  to  a  cumulative  dose  of  6  mg/kg 
atogepant (plasma level 7.7 ± 1.1 µM).  
-  Effects  of  atogepant  on cardiovascular  and  respiratory  function  and  on  body  temperature  were  also 
evaluated in conscious telemetered rhesus monkeys. There were no relevant atogepant-related effects 
on  blood  pressure  parameters  (SBP,  DBP,  and  MBP),  HR,  ECG  parameters  (PR,  QRS,  RR,  and  QT 
intervals),  heart  rate-corrected  QT  interval  (QTci  interval)  or  QT:RR  interval  relationship,  respiratory 
parameters (rate and depth of respiration) and body temperature after single oral doses of 5 and 30 
mg/kg or after daily oral doses of 75 mg/kg atogepant for 3 consecutive days. 
Neurological function 
Atogepant did not show relevant neurobehavioral effects in mice and rats: 
- There were no significant effects on neurological function in conscious mice after a single oral dose of 
100 mg/kg. 
-  There  were  no  effects  on  nervous  system  function  in  rats  at  single  doses  of  up  to  20  mg/kg.    Test 
article-related effects in rats treated with the high dose of 250 mg/kg were limited to decreases in mean 
body temperature (-1.1 °C) and a decrease in the number of line crosses and rearing activity in the open 
field test (1 out of 6 rats).   
Abuse liability 
In studies evaluating the risk for physical dependence and the reinforcing potential in rats, atogepant 
did not show a relevant signal for abuse liability. 
Summary 
Plasma levels of the high dose atogepant groups in the safety pharmacology studies usually exceeded 
the atogepant plasma levels observed for the 60 mg QD clinical atogepant dose. Overall, the findings of 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 20/136 
 
  
 
 
the  safety  pharmacology  studies  with  atogepant  do  not  provide  a  critical  safety  signal  for  the  use  of 
atogepant for the prophylaxis of migraine in humans.  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been included in this application.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  methods  were  established  for 
measurement of atogepant plasma levels in different species. [14C]atogepant derived radioactivity was 
determined by liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite structures were determined by MS.  
All  analytical  methods  were  appropriately  described in  full  detail,  no  discrepancies  have  been  spotted 
between  the  studies.  The  validation  of  the  bioanalytical  methods  included  the  linearity,  sensitivity, 
accuracy,  precision,  dilution,  selectivity,  recovery,  matrix  effect,  carryover  and  reanalysis  of  incurred 
samples  (ISR).  The  bioanalytical  methods  for  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  and  monkey  plasma  samples  were 
successfully validated for atogepant according to testing site standard operating procedures (SOPs) and 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/ICH guidance on method validation in support of Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) studies. 
Absorption 
Atogepant  demonstrated  low  clearance  in  rats,  moderate  clearance  in  rhesus  monkeys  and  a  short 
plasma  half-life  (about  1  to  4  hours)  in  both  species.  The  oral  bioavailability  was  about  27%  in  both 
species. The volume of distribution Vdss amounted to 0.9 L/kg in rats and 3.2 L/kg in rhesus monkeys. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution 
Following  oral  dosing  in  rats,  [14C]atogepant  was  widely  distributed  to  tissues.  Most  tissues  had 
concentrations similar to those in blood, except for central nervous system tissues, eye and bone, which 
had negligible concentrations.  Radioactivity levels in pigmented tissues (e.g., eye uvea and skin) were 
similar between pigmented and albino rats, suggesting no specific association of [14C]atogepant-derived 
radioactivity with melanin. 
Plasma protein binding / Distribution in blood cells 
The  unbound  fraction  of  atogepant  was  4.3,  11.3,  and  4.7%  in  rat,  monkey,  and  human  plasma, 
respectively. Atogepant does not show a preferential partition into red blood cells; the blood to plasma 
concentration ratios were 0.6, 0.9, and 0.8 in rat, monkey, and humans, respectively. 
Metabolism 
Following incubation with human liver microsomes and hepatocytes, two oxidative metabolites, M1 and 
M2 (N-oxide formation respectively 5-hydroxylation on the azaoxindole moiety) were observed. These 
metabolites were also observed following incubation with mouse, rat, and monkey hepatocytes. 
In rat, atogepant is mainly metabolised to M1 and M2. Secondary metabolites including double and triple 
oxidations and several glucuronide conjugates were also detected.  
In monkey, atogepant is also mainly metabolised to M1 and M2. The major circulating component was 
atogepant  with  low,  but  detectable  levels  of  M1  and  metabolite  M23  (dioxygenated  methylated 
glucuronide of atogepant).

In vitro reaction phenotyping experiments indicated that oxidative metabolism of atogepant in human 
liver preparations is predominantly CYP3A4-mediated, with a minor involvement of CYP2D6. 
In  humans,  atogepant  is  susceptible  to  drug-drug  interactions  with  compounds  such  as  ketoconazole 
that  are  known  to  inhibit  CYP3A4.  Results  from  clinical  (drug-drug  interaction)  DDI  studies  with 
itraconazole  (CGP-PK-02)  and  rifampin  (CGP-PK-12)  confirm  that  atogepant  is  a  target  of  DDIs  with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
Excretion 
Following IV or oral administration to bile-duct cannulated rats and monkeys, atogepant was eliminated 
predominately in the form of metabolites into bile. Most of the dose was recovered in excreta within 72 
hours.  
Table 1: Excretion of atogepant into urine, bile and feces 
Atogepant was transferred into the milk of lactating rats at concentrations that were approximately 2-to 
2.5-fold of those achieved in the maternal plasma.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Inhibition of liver enzymes: Atogepant is not an inhibitor of CYP 1A2 or 3A4. Atogepant displayed weak 
inhibition of CYP 2B6, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 2D6 and CYP 2C19. Atogepant is not a potent inhibitor of 
MAO-A or UGT1A1.  
Induction  of  liver  enzymes:  Atogepant  is  an  inducer  of  CYP3A4  in  vitro;  however,  “relative  induction 
score”  modeling  indicated  no  clinically-relevant  induction  potential.  Atogepant  is  not  an  inducer  of 
CYP1A2 or CYP2B6.  
Interaction with drug transporters 
Atogepant  is  a  substrate  but  not  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp  and  BCRP  at  clinically-relevant  concentrations. 
Atogepant is not a substrate of OAT3, OCT2 or MATE1. Atogepant is a mild inhibitor of OCT1 and MATE1 
but  not  MATE-2K  at  clinically-relevant  concentrations.  Atogepant  is  a  substrate  of  hepatic  uptake 
transporters  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3  and  renal  uptake  transporter  OAT1.  At  clinically-relevant 
concentrations, atogepant is not an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3. Atogepant 
is unlikely to disrupt bile acid homeostasis since it showed mild inhibition of BSEP and no inhibition of 
MRP3, MRP4 and NTCP.

Based  on  in  vitro  studies  and  reported  clinically  efficacious  plasma  concentrations,  atogepant  is  not 
anticipated  to  cause  drug-drug  interactions  through  CYP  inhibition  or  induction  or  through  drug 
transporter inhibition at therapeutic doses. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Dedicated single dose toxicity studies have not been included in this application.  
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant conducted a robust repeat-dose toxicity programme in 3 species (mice, rats and monkeys). 
All pivotal studies were GLP compliant. Duration of repeat dose toxicity studies is in line with ICH M3(R2) 
recommendations. There was no atogepant related mortality in repeat dose toxicity studies in mice (up 
to  100 mg/kg/day  for  3 months),  rats  (up  to  100 mg/kg/day  for  6 months,  200 mg/kg/day  for 
3 months), and rhesus monkeys (up to 300 mg/kg/day for 9 months). 
Main observations in the rodent (mouse, rat) studies were post-dose salivation, decreased body weight 
gain, reversible epithelial vacuolation in the small intestine or parathyroid gland and a slight elevation of 
liver ALT transaminase. 
In a 3-month rat study, decreases in body weight gain (16 %, in males only) and increased vacuolation 
in the parathyroid gland were observed at 200 mg/kg/day. The vacuolation of epithelium of the small 
intestine,  primarily  in  the  jejunum  at  20 and  200 mg/kg/day,  was  limited  to  the  villous  tip  and  not 
associated with degeneration or necrosis of the epithelial cells. There was no increase in the severity of 
this change in the 6-month study (with a 1-month recovery period) as compared to the findings from 
the 2-week study. This is consistent with the observation that the vacuolation was seen only in highly 
differentiated surface epithelium, which is replaced within 3 to 5 days as a result of cellular turnover in 
the small intestine of rats. Absence of crypt hyperplasia after 6 months of dosing further supports the 
assumption that the turnover is unaffected in rats with vacuolation. In addition, no neoplastic changes 
were observed in the intestines in the carcinogenicity studies in rats or mice. In the 6-month study. the 
described change was shown to be reversible after a 1-month recovery period and therefore considered 
by the applicant to be of minimal toxicologic significance and not adverse. Additionally, these findings 
were not observed in rhesus monkeys. The applicant considers that the NOAEL for atogepant in rats was 
100 mg/kg/day  in  the  6-month  study  with  an  AUC0-24hr  of  192.5 µM•hr,  which  represents  an 
approximately 33-fold margin over the clinical exposure of about 5.75 µM•hr following 60 mg QD dosing. 
There were no atogepant-related antemortem changes, gross or histomorphologic findings in the first 3-
month monkey study at doses of 4, 15, and 150 mg/kg/day. In the second 3-month monkey study, at 
a  dose  of  300 mg/kg/day,  designed  to  achieve  a  50-fold  margin  to  the  clinical  target  dose  for  the 
migraine prophylaxis indication, very slight, focal arterial inflammation and arterial medial hypertrophy 
was  observed  in  the  artery  of  the  tunica  albuginea  of  the  testes  and  epididymis  in  1  out  of  3 male 
monkeys.  The  nature  of  the  finding  in  this  single  male  monkey  is  considered  to  be  incidental  by  the 
applicant. This male monkey with the findings of vascular injury had the highest exposure at the end of 
Week 13. The mean exposure (AUC) in this study (300 mg/kg/day) on Day 1 was higher (336 μM•hr) 
than the exposure at 150 mg/kg/day (206 μM•hr); however, the average exposures at the end of the 
study  were  similar  between  300 mg/kg/day  (110 μM•hr  with  vascular  injury)  and  150 mg/kg/day 
(109 μM•hr, without vascular injury). The vascular finding was not reproduced in a later 9-month monkey 
study with doses up to 300 mg/kg/day with 4/sex/group. In this study, there were no test article-related 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 23/136 
 
  
 
 
antemortem  changes,  gross  or  histomorphologic  findings  and  the  mean  exposure  (AUC)  at  the 
300 mg/kg/day NOAEL was 70.7 μM•hr (Week 39) which represents an approximate 12-fold margin of 
safety over the reported clinical exposure of about 5.75 μM•hr following 60 mg QD dosing. 
In  the  9-month  study,  systemic  exposure  to  atogepant  was  independent  of  sex  and  increased  with 
increasing dose. Mean AUC0-24 hr and Cmax values of atogepant were approximately dose proportional from 
15 to 40 mg/kg/day and less than dose proportional from 40 to 300 mg/kg/day on Study Day 1 and in 
Study Weeks 5 and 39. In Study Week 13, mean AUC0-24 hr and Cmax values of atogepant were less than 
dose proportional across all dose groups. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Atogepant was negative in in vitro Ames tests and in vitro chromosome aberration assays in CHO cells. 
An oral in vivo micronucleus test was performed as part of a 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. 
No signs of micronucleated PCEs were observed. AUC-based safety margins for the 60 mg QD human 
dose were 22-fold as derived from the 250 mg/kg/day dose in the micronucleus test (AUC0-24h 5.75 μM•hr 
vs. 124 μM•hr, respectively). Taken together, atogepant is not considered to be genotoxic in vitro and 
in vivo. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Atogepant was assessed for its carcinogenic potential in mice and rat 104-week carcinogenicity studies. 
There were no indications of carcinogenic effects nor were any preneoplastic lesions observed in either 
species. AUC-based safety margins in the mouse study for the 60 mg QD human dose at the high dose 
(M + F combined) were approximately 9-fold (AUC0-t 5.75 μM•hr vs. 52 μM•hr, respectively). AUC-based 
safety margins in the rat study for the 60 mg QD human dose as derived from the high dose at day 28 
were  approximately  24-fold  in  males  (AUC0-t 5.75 μM•hr  vs.  135 μM•hr,  respectively)  and  37-fold  in 
females (AUC0-t 5.75 μM•hr vs. 214 μM•hr, respectively). 
In the 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in mice, non-neoplastic findings attributed to atogepant were 
limited to minimal epithelial vacuolation in the duodenum observed in preterminally euthanised males at 
75 mg/kg/day and females at 160 mg/kg/day.  
Overall, based on these data, no carcinogenic risk is expected for patients.  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A  complete  programme  of  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  has  been  performed  with 
atogepant,  including  studies  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  rats,  on  embryo-fetal 
development in rats and rabbits and on pre- and postnatal development in rats. The studies have been 
performed in accordance with the ICH S5 (R3) guideline, except for a lack of statistical analysis of the 
fertility and early embryonic development study and the definitive embryo-fetal developmental studies. 
All pivotal studies were conducted under GLP regulation. In all studies atogepant was administered orally 
as the free base hydrate form in 100% PEG 400. Control animals received vehicle only. Toxicokinetics 
of atogepant were investigated in rats and rabbits in the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies.  
Species-specific  differences  in  in  vitro  affinity  for  the  CGRP-receptor  have  been  observed,  with  lower 
affinity for the rat (Ki 0.7 nM) and rabbit (Ki 2.1 nM) compared to human (Ki 0.026 nM) and monkey (Ki 
0.009  nM),  which  could  potentially  compromise  the  relevance  of  these  species  to  human.  However, 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 24/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
considering  the  lowest  mean  free  Cmax  levels  from  the  definitive  EFD  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits,  the 
exposure  is  approximately  66-fold  and  119-fold,  respectively,  above  the  Ki-value  for  CGRP-receptor 
affinity. Regarding the CIDV-data, the plasma concentration for 47 % inhibition of dermal blood flow in 
rats is similar to the mean Cmax value obtained at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day (lower mid-dose) in the 
EFD-study. For the rabbit, the plasma concentration to achieve 43 % inhibition in the CIDV assay (41 
µM) is approximately 5-fold above the highest mean Cmax-value from the definitive EFD study in rabbits. 
These  data  suggest  that  the  reproduction  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  are 
adequate to evaluate both on-target and off-target effects of atogepant, possibly with some limitations 
in case of the rabbit for the on-target effects based on the data of the CIDV assay. 
Data from the literature suggest that CGRP and related neuropeptides may have essential roles in fetal 
development  and  control  of  fetoplacental/uteroplacental  vascular  tone  as  potent  vasodilators  and 
inhibition  of  CGRP  receptor  activity  may  be  associated  with  impairment  of  uteroplacental  blood  flow, 
resulting  in  fetal  growth  retardation.  The  relevance  of  these  data  for  the  findings  observed  in  the 
reproduction and developmental toxicity studies with atogepant is not known. 
In the male and female fertility and early embryonic developmental toxicity study,  rats were 
treated  with  atogepant  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  5,  10,  or  125  mg/kg/day.  There  was  no  test  article-
related reproductive toxicity at any dose level as assessed by mating performance, fertility, embryonic-
fetal survival, testicular weights, and sperm number and motility. The only test article-related effect was 
a decrease in mean body weight gain and mean food consumption in males in the 20 and 125 mg/kg/day 
dose groups and in females in the 125 mg/kg/day dose group. The NOAEL for female and male fertility 
parameters in rats was 125 mg/kg/day. The NOAELs for general toxicity parameters were 20 mg/kg/day 
(females)  and  5  mg/kg/day  (males).  Based  on  limited  toxicokinetic  data  from  the  embryo-fetal 
developmental toxicity study in rats, the estimated AUC-based safety margin at the NOAEL of the male 
and female fertility to the maximum human exposure at the therapeutic dose of 60 mg QD (AUC: 5.75 
µM*hr) is approximately 17-fold. 
There were no effects of atogepant on reproductive organs in male and female animals in repeated dose 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
In  the  preliminary  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats  and  rabbits,  atogepant-
related  maternal  effects  were  limited  to  a  decrease  in  maternal  body  weight  gain  and  maternal  food 
consumption  in  the  two  highest  dose  groups  (250  and  750  mg/kg/day)  in  rats  and  in  rabbits  in  the 
highest dose group (325 mg/kg/day). Also at these dose levels, developmental toxicity as evidenced by 
decreases in mean live fetal weight were observed in rats and rabbits.  
In  the  definitive  GLP  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats,  atogepant  was 
administered at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 5, 15, 125, or 750 mg/kg/day. There were atogepant-related 
transient  decreases  in  maternal  food  consumption  at  ≥ 125  mg/kg/day.  At  these  dose  levels, 
developmental toxicity was also evident in the fetuses, including a slight decrease in mean fetal weights, 
a  slight  decrease  in  the  mean  number  of  ossified  sacrocaudal  vertebrae,  and  a  slight  increase  in  the 
incidence of fetuses with incompletely ossified skull bones, respectively. Furthermore, a dose-dependent 
increase in fetuses and litters with azygos vein variation at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day were observed. The NOAEL 
for both maternal and developmental toxicity were 15 mg/kg/day. Based on toxicokinetic data in rats, 
the  estimated  AUC-based  safety  margin  at  the  NOAEL  to  the  maximum  human  exposure  at  the 
therapeutic dose of 60 mg QD (AUC: 5.75 µM*hr) is approximately 4-fold. 
In  the  definitive  GLP  embryo  fetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rabbits,  atogepant  was 
administered  at  dose  levels  of  0  (vehicle),  30,  90  or  130  mg/kg/day.  There  were  atogepant-related 
decreases in maternal body weight gain and food consumption at 130 mg/kg/day. At this dose, increased 
incidences of litters and fetuses with visceral variations of absent caudate lobe of the lung and of skeletal 
sternebral  variations  (misaligned,  misshapen  or  extra  ossification  sites  above  first  sternebra)  were 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 25/136 
 
  
 
 
observed. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity (F0 females) and developmental toxicity (F1 litters) were 90 
mg/kg/day Based on toxicokinetic data in rabbits, the estimated AUC-based safety margin at a NOAEL 
of 90 mg/kg/day to the maximum human exposure at the therapeutic dose of 60 mg QD (AUC: 5.75 
µM*hr) is approximately 3-fold. 
In the GLP pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats, atogepant was administered 
at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 15, 45 or 125 mg/kg/day. In addition, the maternal milk and plasma (dams) 
concentrations of atogepant were determined. However, no toxicokinetic analysis was performed. There 
was  no  atogepant-related  mortality  and  no  evidence  of  maternal  toxicity  or  effects  on  maternal 
performance in the F0 generation dams at ≤ 125 mg/kg/day, except for a slight non-significant decrease 
in gestation body weight gain and gestation and lactation food consumption. In the F1 generation, pre-
weaning pup- and post-weaning male body weights were statistically significant lower at 125 mg/kg/day.  
Partly  significant  lower  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  also  observed  in  post-weaning 
males.  Analysis  of  atogepant  milk  concentrations  showed  that  atogepant  is  excreted  in  a  substantial 
amount into rat milk with a milk:plasma concentration ratio of 2- to 2.5-fold. The NOEL for maternal 
toxicity  and  maternal  performance  and  the  NOAEL  for  development  of  the  F1  generation  was 
45 mg/kg/day Based on toxicokinetic data from the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, 
the estimated AUC-based safety margin at the NOAEL for maternal toxicity is approximately 17-fold and 
at  the  NOEL  for  development  of  the  F1  generation  is  approximately  5-fold  to  the  maximum  human 
exposure at the therapeutic dose of 60 mg QD (AUC: 5.75 µM*hr) is. 
Toxicity to juvenile animals 
No paediatric indication is currently proposed for atogepant. Nevertheless, potential adverse effects of 
atogepant on juvenile animals were investigated in rats in two oral studies, a non-GLP DRF study and a 
pivotal GLP study. In the DRF study, juvenile rats were treated for 2-weeks from PND 28 through PND 
42 (corresponding to a child age of approximately 2-12 years) with dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 10, 30 or 
150  mg/kg/day  and  in  the  pivotal  6-week  study,  juvenile  animals  received  atogepant  doses  of  0 
(vehicle),  10,  30,  or  300  mg/kg/day  from  PND  28  through  PND  71  (corresponding  to  a  child  age  of 
approximately  2-18  years)  followed  by  a  treatment-free  recovery  period  through  PND  99  (4-weeks). 
Both  studies  included  toxicokinetic  investigations.  Also  bone  assessment  and  neurohistopathology 
investigations  were  performed  in  the  main  study.  The  toxicity  profile  in  juvenile  rats  was  generally 
comparable to that in adult rats (increase in ALT, vacuolation of epithelium in small intestine, decrease 
in thymus weight) with the exception of bone findings in males. The findings in bone (decrease in distal 
femur total area, total BMX and cortical/subcortical BMC) were not considered adverse by the applicant 
and were associated with minimal effects on male terminal body weights.

Toxicokinetic data are listed alongside with the respective associated toxicity studies. 
2.5.4.7.  Tolerance 
Not applicable. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
The applicant has provided a weight of evidence review in accordance with ICH S8 which did not reveal 
any concerns. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 26/136 
 
  
 
 
Dependence 
In studies evaluating the risk for physical dependence and the reinforcing potential in rats, atogepant 
did not show a relevant signal for abuse liability. 
Impurities 
In  total  about  130  starting  materials,  raw  materials,  intermediates  and  potential  manufacturing 
impurities  were  subjected  to  in  silico  analysis  for  potential  mutagenicity  concerns.  Overall,  the 
toxicological  assessment  of  potential  mutagenic  impurities  is  comprehensive  and  the  applied 
methodology is in line with ICH M7(R1).  
Epimer  (AGN-242245)  is  a  process-related  impurity,  which  was  present  above  the  toxicological 
qualification limit of NMT 0.15%. In silico analyses revealed no mutagenic potential of this impurity. It 
was present in batches used in toxicology studies (e.g. 9-month monkey study, NOAEL 300 mg/kg/day) 
at levels up to 0.64%. The proposed specification limit of NMT 0.2% is thus justified from a toxicological 
point of view.  
Several impurities with structural alerts were considered as non-mutagenic (Class 5) based on provided 
negative  and  GLP-conform  Ames  tests  or  by  referencing  to  publicly  available  mutagenicity  data  (e.g. 
ECHA registration dossiers, OECD, or publications). Impurities with specific structural alerts (e.g. also 
present in the drug substance or known Ames negative impurities), were overruled by expert statements 
and classified as non-mutagenic (Class 4). These approaches are agreed. On request the in silico reports 
(DEREK, Sarah, Case Ultra) were provided. 
Other studies - Phototoxicity 
A  3-day  phototoxicity  study  of  atogepant  in  female  pigmented  rats  with  doses  up  to  40 mg/kg/day 
followed by a single ultraviolet ray exposure did not result in any skin reactions or ocular observations 
indicative of phototoxicity. 
Other studies – Mechanistic studies: Prediction of hepatotoxic potential of atogepant 
In vitro assays related to known hepatotoxicity mechanisms (bile acid transporter inhibition, oxidative 
stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction) were conducted with atogepant and 2 predecessor CGRP receptor 
antagonists  that  were  discontinued  because  of  clinical  hepatotoxicity,  telcagepant  and  MK-3207. 
Subsequently, those results were parameterised into the “DILIsym” model along with proposed clinical 
dose and PBPK models for each compound. Results of the “DILIsym” modeling suggest that atogepant 
has a reduced risk of causing clinically relevant elevations of ALT in excess of 3-fold the upper limit of 
normal (≥ 3X ULN) compared to telcagepant and MK-3207. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA Phase II Tier A and B provided for API atogepant monohydrate is considered acceptable.  
The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in Phase I for atogepant has been 
based on default values. The PECsurface water value exceeds the action limit of 10 ng/l. Consequently, 
a respective Phase II environmental risk assessment was partially performed by the applicant. 
As the Koc values are less than 10000 kg/L and the Kd values are less than 3700 kg/L, Tier B terrestrial 
studies were not required for atogepant. The log Kow for atogepant was determined to be 3.33. Valid 
data  on  a  resulting  OECD  305  fish  bioconcentration  study  were  delivered.  On  the  study  on  Aerobic 
Transformation in Aquatic Systems (OECD 308) atogepant is classified as vP as DT50 total system was 
2561 d (at 12°C). 
Aquatic tests on algae (OECD 201), daphnia (OECD 211), and fish (OECD 210) were acceptable. The 
OECD 209 Activated Sludge Respiration Inhibition Test can be accepted as now the solubility limit at pH 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

7 is used as NOEC. The PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and groundwater were substantially less than 
one  and  the  PEC/PNEC  ratio  for  microorganisms  was  substantially  less  than  0.1.  Thus,  atogepant  is 
unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic compartment.  
According to the study on Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Systems (OECD 308) a strong shift of test 
substance to the sediment was determined. Therefore, a Phase II Tier B Sediment-Water Chironomid 
Toxicity Test (OECD 218) study was conducted to assess the potential impact of atogepant on sediment 
dwelling midges. The PEC/PNEC ratio for sediment was substantially less than one. Thus, atogepant is 
unlikely to represent a risk to sediment dwelling organisms and no further testing is required. 
As  a  result  of  the  above  considerations,  the  API  Atogepant  monohydrate  does  not  pose  a  risk  to  the 
environment when used according to the SmPC.

A  specific  animal  model  for  the  evaluation  of  prophylactic  effects  of  atogepant  on  migraine  was  not 
provided by the applicant. As a surrogate pharmacological parameter for clinical efficacy of atogepant, 
inhibition of capsaicin-induced dermal vasodilatation (CIDV), an effect considered to be mediated largely 
by release of CGRP, was used by the applicant.  
In isolated coronary, meningeal and cerebral artery segments, atogepant inhibited the vasodilatory effect 
of  αCGRP.  However,  while  in  distal  coronary  artery  segments  the  inhibitory  effect  of  atogepant  was 
apparently  competitive  in  nature,  in  middle  meningeal  and  cerebral  artery  segments,  atogepant 
antagonised the αCGRP effect apparently in a non-competitive manner. 
These results suggest that more than one receptor type is involved in the observed antagonistic effects 
of atogepant and that the vasodilatory effects of CGRP on distal coronary artery segments and on middle 
meningeal and cerebral artery segments are mediated via different receptors.  
In conclusion, non-clinical receptor binding studies and in vitro functional studies point to an involvement 
of more than one receptor type in the pharmacological effects of atogepant. Atogepant shows affinity to 
several receptors of the calcitonin/CGRP-receptor family. In view of the clinically relevant free plasma 
concentrations of atogepant (≥ 20 nM for a 60 mg dose) and the fact that CGRP and amylin-1 receptors 
are considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of migraine, inhibitory effects of atogepant at these 
receptors  (Ki-value  26  pM  respectively  2.4  nM)  could  be  of  clinical  relevance.  However,  the  precise 
mechanism of atogepant in the prophylaxis of migraine remains to be established. 
Safety pharmacology 
Plasma levels of the high dose atogepant groups in the safety pharmacology studies usually exceeded 
atogepant plasma levels observed for the 60 mg QD clinical atogepant dose. Overall, the findings of the 
safety  pharmacology  studies  with  atogepant  do  not  provide  a  critical  safety  signal  for  the  use  of 
atogepant for the prophylaxis of migraine in humans.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been included in this application. This 
is considered acceptable, since a non-clinical pharmacodynamic model for evaluation of prevention of 
migraine is not available. Potential pharmacodynamic interactions from concomitant use of atogepant 
with other gepants or with CGRP antibodies, used for acute treatment of migraine, were discussed on 
the clinical level (see Clinical Aspects).

Page 29/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
The ADME data submitted for rat and rhesus monkey provide supporting evidence for the use of these 
species in the atogepant toxicity studies. 
Based on in vitro studies and clinically efficacious plasma concentrations, atogepant is not anticipated to 
cause drug-drug interactions through CYP inhibition or induction or through drug transporter inhibition 
at therapeutic doses. 
Toxicity 
Overall, the non-clinical toxicology programme is largely in line with the recommendations of the ICH 
M3(R2) guideline. However, the following points are specifically addressed:  
Single dose toxicity 
Dedicated single dose toxicity studies have not been performed with atogepant. However, in accordance 
with  the  “Questions  and  answers  on  the  withdrawal  of  the  Note  for  guidance on  single  dose  toxicity” 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010) this is considered acceptable, since relevant information on acute toxicity 
of atogepant can be obtained from the available repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In accordance with ICH M3(R2) recommendations, the applicant conducted oral repeat-toxicity studies 
for up to 3 months in mice, up to 6 months (with a 1-month recovery period) in rats and up to 9 months 
in rhesus monkeys. In addition, information on chronic toxicity of atogepant is available from the 2-year 
carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats (see below). 
In the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies, at the NOAEL, AUC-based exposure multiples of >1 compared 
with the clinical exposure at the 60 mg QD dose were observed (see “Estimation of safety margins for 
atogepant”, below). 
Main observations in the rodent (mouse, rat) studies were post-dose salivation, decreased body weight 
gain, reversible epithelial vacuolation in the small intestine or parathyroid gland and a slight elevation of 
liver ALT transaminase. 
In  the  9-month  rhesus  monkey  study,  no  relevant  atogepant-related  toxicity  was  observed  up  to the 
highest tested dose of 300 mg/kg/day. 
Overall, the repeat dose toxicity studies do not indicate a critical safety signal for the use of atogepant 
for the prophylaxis of migraine in humans. 
Genotoxicity 
Based on the submitted data, atogepant is not considered to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. 
Carcinogenicity 
Based  on  the  data  from  the  2-year  oral  carcinogenicity  studies  with  atogepant  in  mice  and  rats,  no 
carcinogenic risk is expected for patients. 
In the mouse study, non-neoplastic findings attributed to atogepant were limited to minimal epithelial 
vacuolation in the duodenum observed in preterminally euthanised males at 75 mg/kg/day and females 
at 160 mg/kg/day.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A  complete  programme  of  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  has  been  performed  with 
atogepant,  including  studies  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  rats,  on  embryo-fetal 
development in rats and rabbits and on pre- and postnatal development in rats. The studies have been 
performed in accordance with the ICH S5 (R3) guideline, except for a lack of statistical analysis of the 
fertility and early embryonic development study and the definitive embryo-fetal developmental studies.  
Species-specific  differences  in  in  vitro  affinity  for  the  CGRP-receptor  have  been  observed,  with  lower 
affinity for the rat (Ki, 0.7 nM) and rabbit (Ki, 2.1 nM) compared to human (Ki, 0.026 nM) and monkey 
(Ki, 0.009 nM), which could potentially compromise the relevance of these species to human. However, 
plasma Cmax-levels in the rat and rabbit reproduction and developmental toxicity studies are well above 
the respective Ki-value for CGRP-receptor affinity, suggesting adequacy for evaluation of on- and off-
target effects in these species. 
Data from the literature, discussed by the applicant, suggest that CGRP and related neuropeptides may 
have  essential  roles  in  fetal  development  and  control  of  fetoplacental/uteroplacental  vascular  tone  as 
potent  vasodilators  and  antagonism  of  CGRP  receptor  activity  may  be  associated  with  impairment  of 
uteroplacental  blood  low,  resulting  in  fetal  growth  retardation.  The  relevance  of  these  data  for  the 
findings observed in the reproduction and developmental toxicity studies with atogepant is unknown. 
In  the  definitive  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  some  findings  were 
observed with an unclear relation to treatment. In rats, a dose-dependent increase in resorptions and 
post-implantation loss at ≥ 125 mg/kg/day and of fetuses and litters with azygos vein variation at ≥ 15 
mg/kg/day were observed. In rabbits, increased incidences of litters and fetuses with visceral variations 
of absent caudate lobe of the lung and of skeletal sternebral variations (misaligned, misshapen or extra 
ossification sites above first sternebra) were observed at 130 mg/kg/day. Whereas in rats the increase 
in resorptions and postimplantation losses are likely incidental, for the azygos vein variation a relation 
to treatment cannot be excluded for the highest dose group, since the incidence was above the historical 
control. Nevertheless, this has no great impact on the overall risk assessment and on the NOAEL, which 
is already set at a dose level of 15 mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity of the F1 litters. However, it 
was included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Also, for the increased incidences of litters and fetuses with visceral variations of absent caudate lobe of 
the lung and of skeletal sternebral variations (misaligned, misshapen or extra ossification sites above 
first sternebra) observed in rabbits an association with atogepant treatment cannot be excluded since 
the incidences were above the historical control. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity of the F1 litters 
should be lowered to 90 mg/kg/day.  
For the pre-postnatal study in rats, in the F1 generation pre-weaning pup- and post-weaning male- body 
weights were statistically significantly lower at 125 mg/kg/day as well as a partly significant lower body 
weight gain and food consumption were also observed in post-weaning males. Analysis of atogepant milk 
concentrations  showed  that  atogepant  is  excreted  in  a  substantial  amount  into  rat  milk  with  a 
milk:plasma concentration ratio of 2- to 2.5-fold. Also, in the juvenile toxicity studies with atogepant in 
rats,  an  atogepant-related  body  weight  loss,  associated  with  further  findings  was  observed  in  males. 
Therefore,  the  relevance  to  humans  is  currently  not  known  Although  the  body  weight  loss  was  not 
considered as adverse it is mentioned in section 5.3 of the SmPC, together with the approximately 5-
fold safety margin to human exposure at the MRHD based on the TK data extrapolated from the rat EFD 
study at the NOEL of 45 mg/kg/day, 
Although no paediatric indication is currently proposed for atogepant, two juvenile animal toxicity studies 
in rats have been performed. The toxicity profile in juvenile rats was generally comparable to that in 
adult rats (increase in ALT, vacuolation of epithelium in small intestine, decrease in thymus weight) with 
the exception of bone findings in males.

Phototoxicity 
A  3-day  phototoxicity  study  of  atogepant  in  female  pigmented  rats  with  doses  up  to  40 mg/kg/day 
followed by a single ultraviolet ray exposure did not result in any skin reactions or ocular observations 
indicative of phototoxicity.  
According to the ICH S10 “Guideline on phototoxicity testing”, for new active substances, in the EU a 
validated in vitro alternative method should generally be used before considering animal testing. A tiered 
approach could include (i) an evaluation whether a compound absorbs wavelengths between 290 and 
700  nm.  Absorption  with  a  molar  extinction  coefficient  (MEC)  less  than  1000  L  mol-1  cm-1  is  not 
considered to result in a photosafety concern (ii) For compounds with a MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 
cm-1, an in vitro phototoxicity assay should be considered. The currently most widely used in vitro assay 
for phototoxicity is the “In vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test” (3T3 NRU-PT) for which a 
guideline is available (OECD Test No. 432). 
However,  the  ICH  S10  guideline  also  clearly  spells  out,  that  in  cases,  where  an  in  vivo  animal 
phototoxicity study has already been conducted, there is no reason to subsequently conduct an in vitro 
phototoxicity assay. In conclusion, for atogepant no additional non-clinical in vitro phototoxicty testing 
is requested. 
Estimation of safety margins for atogepant 
Marked interspecies difference in the in vitro affinity for the CGRP receptor exist with the rat (Ki, 0.7 nM), 
mouse (Ki, 0.13 nM), and rabbit (Ki, 2.1 nM) having lower affinity for the CGRP receptor than monkey 
(Ki, 0.009 nM) and human (Ki, 0.026 nM). Despite this, pharmacologically relevant plasma levels were 
likely achieved in the rat and rabbit studies as supported by the CIDV assay (a biomarker for peripheral 
target activity of CGRP) and the fact that plasma levels measured in safety pharmacology and toxicology 
studies were significantly greater than respective Ki values in these species. Although CIDV data in the 
mouse  are  not  available,  a  pharmacologically  relevant  exposure  was  likely  achieved  in  mouse  safety 
assessment studies, as the affinity of atogepant for the mouse CGRP receptor is higher than for the rat 
one. The high-dose (i.e., 300 mg/kg/day) exposure achieved in the monkey 9-month study resulted in 
a Cmax (on Day 1) that exceeded the EC50 in the monkey CIDV assay (1 nM) by more than 10,000-fold. 
Thus,  the  rat,  mouse,  rabbit,  and  monkey  studies  are  considered  to  provide  an  appropriate  toxicity 
evaluation for both on- and off-target related toxicity. 
The exposure multiples achieved in the pivotal toxicology studies are shown below.

Absorption  
Atogepant drug substance is categorised as a BCS II molecule. The poor aqueous solubility of atogepant 
drug  substance  presented  a  great  challenge  for  the  development  of  conventional  solid  oral  tablet 
formulations  with  desired  immediate  release  attributes.  The  formulation  evolution  through  different 
clinical stages was as follows. 
Initially,  to  support  the  first-in-human  SAD  Phase  1  study  (Study  MK-8031  P001),  an  oral  solution 
formulation with atogepant was developed. 
Later, solid oral dosage formulations were explored in Phase 1 clinical studies. 
The HME-OCT formulation was used for all Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies and is the to-be-marketed 
tablet formulation. 
Early SAD using an oral solution 
A Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of 
MK-8031 (Study MK-8031 P001) 
In  Part  I  of  early  SAD  study  P001  single  doses  of  1,  2.5,  5,  10,  20,  40,  and  50  mg  (on-site  solution 
formulation) and placebo were administered in healthy, young male subjects. Subjects were assigned to 
1 of 2 alternating panels (A or B) consisting of 8 subjects each (n = 6 active, n = 2 placebo per dose 
level).  Subjects  received  alternating  single  rising  oral  doses  of  AGP  or  placebo  in  up  to  5  treatment 
periods (Periods 1 through 5). There was a minimum 7-day washout between treatment periods for any 
given subject. All doses were administered after an overnight fast.  
Following oral administration of single doses of atogepant (solution; 1 to 50 mg dose), atogepant was 
absorbed  rapidly  with  median  Tmax  values  ranging  from  1  to  2  hours  post-dose.  The  plasma  profile 
declined generally bi-exponentially post-Cmax. Approximately 90% of the total AUC  was contained in 
the first 24 hours.  
An  exploratory  analysis  of  dose  proportionality  over  the  dose  range  1-mg  to  50-mg  was  conducted. 
Estimates and 95% CIs [1 represents exact dose proportionality] for the slope from the power model 
were 1.01 (0.96, 1.05) for AUC0-∞, 0.96 (0.91, 1.01) for Cmax, 1.02 (0.97, 1.07) for C2hr, and 0.97 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

(0.90, 1.04) for C24hr, suggesting approximately dose proportional increases for these PK parameters 
over the 1-mg to 50-mg dose range. 
Early tablet SD-OCT formulation 
A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics 
of Atogepant (Study MK-8031 P002) 
Study P002 was a 2-part study in which a SD-OCT formulation of atogepant was administered to healthy 
young subjects in a single-dose extension study (Part I) and a multiple rising–dose study (Part II). In 
Part I, single doses of 40 mg (with and without food), 100 mg (fasted), 170 mg (fasted), and 200 mg 
(fasted)  atogepant  or  placebo  were  administered  in  5  periods  to  a  single  panel  of  8  subjects  (n  =  6 
active, n = 2 placebo at each dose level).  
In Part II, multiple doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 170 mg atogepant or placebo were administered fasted 
daily for 10 days in sequential panels of 8 subjects (n = 6 active, n = 2 placebo at each dose level). One 
additional  panel  received  30  mg  atogepant  or  placebo  twice  daily  for  10  days.  Blood  samples  for 
assessment of plasma concentrations of atogepant were taken on Days 1 and 10 at pre-dose and 20 
minutes, 40 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-dose. On Days 3, 4, 5, and 8, blood 
was collected pre-dose. Additionally, on Day 10, samples were taken at 48 and 72 hours post-dose. 
Similar  to  the  on-site  solution  formulation  in  Study  P001,  atogepant  was  absorbed  rapidly  after  oral 
administration of single doses of the SD-OCT formulation from 40 to 200 mg to healthy subjects in Part 
I of study P002. The median Tmax values ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 hours post-dose. The plasma profile 
declined generally bi-exponentially post-Cmax, and the apparent terminal t1/2 appeared to be about 11 
hours. The AUC0-∞ and Cmax of single doses of 40 mg atogepant OCT appeared to be about 2-fold and 
3-fold higher, respectively, given as the tablet formulation compared to those observed for oral solution 
at 40 mg in Study MK-8031 P001. The difference appeared to be due to a higher bioavailability and a 
potentially faster rate of absorption for the tablet formulation compared to solution formulation. 
In Part II, multiple doses of atogepant (SD-OCT) were administered once daily for 10 days in a total of 
4 panels of 8 subjects each (6 active, 2 placebo). Upon review of individual concentration-time profiles 
at different dose levels, it appeared that most subjects reached steady state by Day 3. The AUC0-24h 
and Cmax geometric mean accumulation ratios (Day 10/Day 1) ranged from 1.16 to 0.77, demonstrating 
minimal accumulation, which is generally consistent with expectation based on the single-dose PK profile 
(bi-exponential decay with 11-hour terminal t1/2).

(PMF low compression HME-OCT and PMF high compression HME-OCT) to healthy subjects 
under fasting conditions (PK population; MK-8031 P008) 
Study P008 is important to the overall PK development, since it is intended to deliver comparative BA 
data  between  the  SD-OCT  and  the  HME-OCT  tablet  formulation,  and  thereby  to  build  the  bridge  to 
previous PK study P002. At the same time, a low-compression force version of the tablet is tested vs a 
high-compression force version. 
The  extent  and  rate  of  absorption  were  similar  between  the  SD-OCT  tablet  and  the  HME-OCT  tablet 
formulation.  Indeed,  GMRs  were  close  to  1.  Formally,  however,  study  P008  did  not  demonstrate 
bioequivalence  between  the  formulations,  since  the  upper  limit  of  general  80-125%  criteria  for  the 
90%CIs  was  exceeded  for  Cmax  (GMR  Cmax  high  compression:  1.05  [0.83,  1.33],  GMR  Cmax  low

Single-Centre, Randomised, Open-Label, Single-Dose, Two-Period Crossover Study to 
Evaluate the Effect of a High-Fat Meal on the Pharmacokinetics of an Immediate-Release 
Tablet Formulation of Atogepant (Study 3101-105-002) 
In food study 105, subjects were randomly assigned to receive interventions A and B in 1 of 2 sequences, 
with a washout of at least 7 days between each study intervention. The 2 study interventions were: (A) 
single dose of 60 mg atogepant under fed conditions; (B) single dose of 60 mg atogepant under fasted 
conditions. Blood samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of atogepant were taken at pre-dose 
and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours post-dose.

Since the 90% CI of the GLSM ratio was not contained within the default equivalence limits of 80.00% 
to 125.00% for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, or Cmax, the high-fat meal was demonstrated to have a statistically 
significant effect on atogepant exposure for the IR tablet (HME-OCT) formulation. Administration under 
fed  conditions  reduced  AUCs  by  approximately  18%,  reduced  Cmax  by  approximately  22%,  and  no 
change in median Tmax.

A Study of the Mass Balance and Metabolism of [14C]-Atogepant in Healthy Male Subjects 
(Study CGP-PK-03) 
Mass balance study PK-03 was a single-centre, open-label, single-dose study in which 6 healthy male 
subjects aged 19 through 55 years were enrolled.  
Following a single oral dose of 50 mg (~ 200 μCi) [14C]-atogepant in healthy male subjects, the median 
Tmax values were 1 hour and 1.5 hours post-dose with mean terminal elimination t1/2 values of 18.46 
hours  and  11.64  hours  for  atogepant  and  total  radioactivity,  respectively.  Atogepant  contributed  to 
approximately 75% of the total radioactivity systemic exposure (AUC).

Approximately 8% and 81% of the radioactive dose of 14C-atogepant was recovered in urine and faeces, 
respectively  through  the  last  collection  interval.  Thereof,  approximately  5%  of  the  administered  dose 
was recovered as parent drug (atogepant) in urine. Atogepant was the only peak detected over 1% of 
the  radioactive  dose  in  urine.  In  faeces,  42%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  as  parent  drug  due  to 
unabsorbed  drug,  biliary  excretion,  intestinal  secretion,  or  a  combination.  Most  of  the  administered 
radioactivity was recovered in the first 24 hours (~ 90%).

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
In  the  human  ADME  study  with  14C-atogepant  (Study  CGP-PK-03),  approximately  8%  of  the  total 
administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, most radioactivity (approximately 81%) was found in 
the  faecal  samples.  Thus,  biliary/hepatic  route  of  elimination  is  the  major  route  of  elimination  of 
atogepant, while the renal route plays a minor role. A clinical pharmacology study to evaluate the impact 
of  renal  impairment  on  the  PK  of  atogepant  was  not  conducted,  and  instead,  physiologically  based 
pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  modelling  based  on  the  atogepant  60  mg  QD  dose  along  the  population  PK 
approach was used to assess the impact of renal impairment. 
In the covariate screening (Report CGP-MS-03), renal function (as measured by creatinine clearance in 
mild and moderately impaired patients) did not have a statistically significant effect on any structural PK 
parameter. The atogepant 10 mg QD dose is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
Impaired hepatic function

Study PK-01 was a multi-centre, open-label, PK study of atogepant in 32 subjects with impaired hepatic 
function (8 mild, 8 moderate, 8 severe) and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. The objective of 
the study was to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability profiles of atogepant in subjects with impaired 
hepatic  function  and  matched  healthy  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  after  a  single  dose 
administration. Subjects received a single 60 mg dose of atogepant on Day 1. 
Table 16: Summary of statistical analysis of plasma atogepant PK parameters following 
single dose oral administration of 60 mg atogepant in participants with mild, moderate, or 
severe hepatic impairment (test) as compared with participants with normal hepatic 
function (reference), PK population 
Compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, the maximum plasma concentrations of atogepant 
were generally unchanged in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (+9%, -12%, 
-4% respectively). The overall extent of atogepant systemic exposures (AUC) were slightly higher (14% 
to  38%  higher)  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  as  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function; but these changes are unlikely to be clinically relevant. 
In participants with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment administered a single oral dose of 60 
mg  atogepant,  percentage  of  plasma  protein-bound  atogepant  was  97.4%,  97.1%,  and  95.3%, 
respectively, as compared with 98.2% in participants with normal hepatic function. The unbound fraction 
of plasma atogepant was 2.6-fold higher in severe hepatic impairment group compared to participants 
with normal hepatic function.

PK in elderly female vs elderly male 
A Single Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MK-8031 
in Elderly Subjects (Study MK-8031 P003) 
Study P003 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel, single-dose study in healthy 
elderly male and elderly female subjects. Subjects were divided in 2 panels of 8 subjects each: Panel A: 
8  healthy  elderly  female  subjects  (n  =  6  active  and  2  placebo);  and  Panel  B:  8  healthy  elderly  male 
subjects  (n  =  6  active  and  2  placebo).  Subjects  received  a  single  oral  dose  of  40  mg  atogepant  or 
matching placebo in a randomised fashion.

following the administration of a single oral dose of 40 mg atogepant in healthy elderly 
females and males (PK population; MK-8031 P003) 
Following a single dose of 40 mg of atogepant, AUC0-∞ was 10% greater (GMR [90% CI] of 1.10 [0.59, 
2.05]) and Cmax was 38% greater in elderly females than in elderly males. The median Tmax occurred 
earlier in elderly females (1.26 hours) than in elderly males (2.00 hours).

Table 19: PK parameters of atogepant following single doses of atogepant alone, and 
following concomitant administration of CYP3A4, P-gp or OATP inhibitors/inducers 
Co-administration of atogepant with itraconazole increased atogepant Cmax  by 2.15-fold and AUC by 
5.5-fold.  Thus,  CYP3A4  inhibition  by  itraconazole  or  other  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  will  result  in  a 
clinically significant increase in the exposure of atogepant. The lowest dose of atogepant (10 mg) should 
be used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin). 
A statistically significant increase in atogepant systemic exposure (2.85-fold for AUC0-24h and 2.23-fold 
for  Cmax)  was  observed  following  co-administration  of  single-dose  atogepant  60  mg  and  single-dose 
rifampin 600 mg compared with administration of single-dose atogepant 60 mg alone. The increases in 
atogepant Cmax and AUC when co-administered with OATP inhibitors could be clinically significant and

atogepant  dose  adjustment  is  recommended.  A  lower  dose  of  atogepant  (10  or  30  mg)  should  be 
considered with concomitant OATP inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine).

A  possible  interaction  of  atogepant  with  H2  receptor  blocker  famotidine  was  examined to  explore the 
effect of gastric pH change on atogepant’s PK. Concomitant use of 60 mg atogepant (single dose) with 
famotidine  (20  mg  in  the  evening  of  Day  -1  and  the  morning  of  Day  1)  appeared  to  reduce  the 
bioavailability of atogepant, with Cmax reduced by approximately 50%, AUC reduced by approximately 
20%, and Tmax unchanged in the presence of famotidine.

Concomitant use of 60 mg atogepant (single dose) with esomeprazole (multiple doses of 40 mg once 
daily for 5 days) appeared to reduce the rate of absorption (23% reduced Cmax, increased Tmax), but 
not the extent of absorption (AUC).

Modelling and Simulation 
Three  different  PopPK  models  were  developed  using  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling  during  clinical 
development.  
Firstly,  a  popPK  (2016)  was  used  to  describe  data  from  five  phase  1  studies  (n=99)  through  a  two-
compartment-model with first order absorption and linear elimination. As covariates, formulation on ka 
and Freal was used as well as dose on ka, famotidine treatment on Frel and gender on CL. This analysis 
has limited value due to the small sample size. 
Secondly, (2019) more data was available for model development from nine phase 1 studies and one 
phase  2/3  study  CGP-MD-01  (n=631).  The  final  model  describing  these  data  best  was  a  three-
compartment model with linear elimination. Typical CL and V were estimated to be 18.2 L/h and 73 L, 
respectively. IIV was included on CL, ka, and intercompartmental CL. Dose had a significant influence 
on ka (lower with increasing dose level) and on Frel (higher with increasing dose level). Furthermore, 
the different drug formulations added complexity to model the absorption phase. 
This model was evaluated using GOF checks and VPCs and this evaluation showed an appropriate fit of 
the model. This model was further used to test different efficacy models (see Dose-Response Modelling 
2.2.3) and was used to simulate exposure in children aged six to less than 18 years of age. 
Thirdly,  in  2020  phase  3  data  from  study  3101-301-002  was  added  to  the  dataset  (n=1287  in  total) 
resulting  in  11766  observations  combining  HV  data  and  patient  data.  Typical  apparent  clearance  was 
23.7% lower in patients (17.4 L/h) compared to healthy volunteers (22.9 L/h). Typical apparent volume 
of distribution was estimated as 86.1 L. IPREDs in GOF plots revealed a tendency to underprediction. 
Parameter estimates for the final PopPK model are listed below. GOF plots and VPCs are shown in Figure 
3.

This model was further used to develop a dose-response model as an exposure response model showed 
no clear relationship between exposure and response. The effect of two migraine days less per month 
compared  to  placebo  was  supported  through  efficacy  simulation,  but  no  clear  atogepant  dose-  or 
exposure-response relationship was observed.  
A combined PBPK model analysis for CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP was conducted using clinical data from 
study  CGP-PK-12 
(rifampicin  DDI 
study) 
for  development  and 
studies  3101-101-002 
(Japanese/Caucasian bridging study) and CGP-PK-02 (itraconazole DDI study) for verification. The aim 
was to predict plasma concentrations of atogepant after a single dose of 60 mg atogepant after dosing 
of  a  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  mild  CYP3A4  inhibitor  as  well  as  the  prediction  of  atogepant  plasma 
concentrations following complete P-gp or BCRP inhibition. A first Addendum regarding PBPK modelling 
was submitted to predict the impact of OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and renal impairment. A second Addendum 
was submitted for atogepant impact as a perpetrator for OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1. 
This modelling analysis was not accepted, as the platform is not qualified for the intended purpose. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 52/136 
 
  
 
 
 
In  addition  to  that,  a  simplified  PBPK  model  was  presented  suggesting  that  the  AUC  of  atogepant  is 
predicted to be 2.75-fold higher when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. This increase 
would be larger than predicted using the combined PBPK model. The applicant discussed whether dose 
adjustments are needed based on the generally expected increase in the AUC as atogepant appears to 
be a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.  
The platform for the combined PBPK model approach is not qualified, simulation results are not accepted. 
Therefore, results derived by PBPK modelling were removed from the SmPC. No additional analyses for 
BCRP were submitted. PBPK modelling is regarded as not sufficiently qualified to predict BCRP transporter 
interactions. As mentioned BRCP inhibitors were not prohibited in pivotal studies, the applicant provided 
the available clinical data and compare atogepant exposure in patients treated with and without BRCP 
inhibitor.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Atogepant is a potent antagonist of the human CGRP receptor. In the ligand-binding assays, atogepant 
exhibited very high affinity for human CGRP receptors (Ki = 15-26 pM) as well as monkey CGRP receptors 
(Ki = 9 pM). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics: Inhibition of CGRP-induced vasodilation 
A Single-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of 
Atogepant (Study MK-8031 P001) 
This was a 2-Part study. Part II of Study P001 was a 4-period crossover study in 16 healthy male subjects 
who  each  received  single  oral  doses  of  0.4,  2.5,  and  30  mg  of  atogepant  (on-site  formulation)  and 
placebo, with PD assessments of the inhibition of Capsaicin-induced Dermal Vasodilation (CIDV). 
Concomitant with dosing of atogepant or placebo, subjects received 2 single topical doses (300 μg/20 
μL and 1000 μg/20 μL) of capsaicin solution (in ethanol/polysorbate 20/water [3:3:4]) at 2 time points 
via 10-mm rubber ‘O’ rings on the volar surface of each forearm (a total of 4 capsaicin applications). 
Capsaicin applications on each arm were timed so that the maximal blood flow response coincided with 
appropriate timepoints relative to the PK profile of atogepant (i.e., 0.5 and 4.5 hours). Laser Doppler 
scans of the subjects’ forearms were conducted at baseline, 1 hour, and 5 hours as a measure of blood 
flow. Blood samples were also drawn at 1 hour and 5 hours to obtain plasma PK of atogepant. 
Mean  perfusion  decreased  in  dose-dependent  fashion  compared  with  placebo  following  single  dose 
administration of atogepant, both at 1 and 5 hours post-dose, regardless for the capsaicin concentration 
applied. 
Evaluation of the Effects of a Single Supra-Therapeutic Dose of Atogepant on Cardiac 
Repolarisation in Healthy Participants (Study CGP-PK-04) 
Part A of this study was designed to establish the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of a supra-therapeutic 
dose (300 mg) of atogepant, in order to determine whether this supra-therapeutic dose could be safely 
evaluated in Part B. The study design for Part B was designed to assess the effects of a supra-therapeutic 
dose of atogepant (300mg) on cardiac repolarisation. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 53/136 
 
  
 
 
Mean change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) on atogepant followed closely the placebo pattern and did not 
suggest an effect on cardiac repolarisation. After a single, oral dose of 300 mg atogepant, the LS mean 
point estimate and upper 2-sided 90% CIs for the LS mean difference between atogepant and placebo 
QTcF intervals were lower than the 10-msec threshold at all timepoints. A maximum change in mean 
ΔΔQTcF of +0.6 msec was noted after 300 mg atogepant treatment at 24 hours postdose. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A comprehensive PK study programme was provided to delineate the PK profile of atogepant (AGP) 10 
and 60 mg tablets subject of the present MAA. During the clinical pharmacology programme, validated 
HPLC-MS/MS  methods  were  used  to  determine  the  concentrations  of  atogepant  and  co-administered 
drugs in human plasma, whole blood (as measured using dry blood spot assay), and urine (as applicable 
in individual studies). In general, the bioanalytical methods are acceptable. The poor aqueous solubility 
of atogepant drug substance presented a great challenge for the development of conventional solid oral 
tablet  formulations  with  desired  immediate  release  (IR)  attributes.  Therefore,  an  oral  solution 
formulation  with  atogepant  dissolved  in  PEG  400,  and/or  water  was  developed  for  the  initial  first-in-
human  SAD  study  P001.  Two  bioavailability  enhancing  formulations  were  developed:  an  intermediate 
SD-OCT formulation and the HME-OCT proposed for commercialisation.  
First-in-human  study  P001  demonstrated  rapid  absorption  of  AGP  following  single  ascending  doses  of 
AGP, administered as on site solution, across the 1 mg to 50 mg dose range. Repetitive dosing of 5 mg 
in Periods 2 and 5 yielded reasonably similar blood levels pointing to a rather low intra-subject variability. 
Both the rate and extent of absorption increased in a dose dependent way.  Exploratory data point to 
approximate dose proportionality, although the dataset is too limited for definite conclusion. 
Early PK study P002 examined the bioavailability of single ascending doses of AGP using the intermediate 
spray-dried OCT tablet formulation (Part I). Higher doses between 40 mg and 200 mg were applied as 
compared to previous PK study P001. Inter-study comparison with study P001 (testing the oral solution) 
points to increased availability for the newly developed tablet. After SD administration of 40 mg AGP 
about 3-fold higher AUC values were observed with the spray-dried tablet formulation. Absorption was 
rapid with Tmax values of 1 -1.5 hrs and elimination was similar (elimination half-life of 9-11 hrs) across 
the  40-200  mg  high  dose  range.  About  linear  increases  in  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  were 
observed across the 40 mg to 170 mg range, while AUC and Cmax appeared to reach a plateau when 
the dose was further increased to 200 mg. Absolute bioavailability of atogepant was not determined. 
Although  (only)  the  intermediate  SD-OCT  tablet  formulation  was  used  in  the  multiple  dose  Part  II  of 
study P002, it is considered to contribute valuable information for the once-daily dose regimen pursued 
during the subsequent clinical development. Compatible with the elimination half-life of about 9-11 hrs 
found after single dose administration, no clinically relevant accumulation was observed after once daily 
doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 170 mg over 10 days. This is reflected by GMR comparison of AUC and 
Cmax  between  Day  1  and  Day  10,  and  also  by  trough  concentration  levels  observed  pre-dose  on 
intermediate Days 3, 4, 5, and 8. Pre-dose blood concentrations reach about plateau values after about 
third once-daily dosing. Apart from testing once daily dosing, study P002 also contained a dose arm with 
30 mg twice daily dosing over 10 days. C24 hrs trough values after 30 mg BID dosing were remarkably 
high, higher than after 100 mg once daily dosing and almost reaching the level of the 170 mg once daily 
regime. The clinical significance of this overall less fluctuating plasma concentration profile following a 
twice daily dosing regimen was not clear at this stage. The 30 mg BID dose arm was taken over into 
phase II/III dose finding study CGP-MD-01.

Study P008 is important to the overall PK development, since it is intended to deliver comparative BA 
data  between  the  SD-OCT  and  the  HME-OCT  tablet  formulation,  and  thereby  to  build  the  bridge  to 
previous PK study P002. The extent and rate of absorption were similar between the SD-OCT tablet and 
the HME-OCT tablet formulation. Indeed, GMRs were close to 1. Formally, however, study P008 did not 
demonstrate bioequivalence between the formulations, since the upper limit of general 80-125% criteria 
for the 90%CIs was exceeded for Cmax (GMR Cmax high compression: 1.05 [0.83, 1.33], GMR Cmax 
low compression 1.07 [0.85, 1.34]). It is reminded that comparative BA study P008 was exploratory and 
was not powered to demonstrate BE. Failure to formally conclude BE does not invalidate the transfer of 
data  obtained  for  the  intermediate  SD-OCT  formulation  from  study  P002.  Multiple  dose  study  P002 
yielded baseline information on AGP’s PK profile after multiple once daily dosing over 10 days in terms 
of  accumulation  and  elimination  half-life.  These  data  are  considered  meaningful  to  inform  dosing 
regimens tested in subsequent dose finding study CGP-MD-01. 
Food  study  105  was  conducted  after  finalisation  of  phase  II/III  dose  finding  study  CGP-MD-01  and 
examined the 60 mg single dose of atogepant, ultimately proposed as regular daily dose in the SmPC. 
Ingestion  of  a  standardised  high-fat,  high-calorie  meal  reduced  AUC  by  about  18%  and  Cmax  of 
atogepant by about 22%. Hence, a statistically significant food effect was observed. However, the time 
to Cmax (2 hrs) and elimination half-life (9-10 hrs) remained unaffected by the fed vs fasted condition. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC specifies that /../ is to be taken once daily orally with or without food. This is 
acceptable given the fact that in pivotal trials 301 and 303, expanding over a 12-week outpatient DBT 
period,  no  restrictions  were  specified  with  regard  to  AGP  administration  in the  fed  resp.  fasted  state. 
Participants were merely instructed to take their study intervention at approximately the same time each 
day. 
Mass  balance  study  PK-03  showed  that  urinary  excretion  plays  a  minor  role  only  as  an  elimination 
pathway. After oral administration of 50 mg radiolabelled atogepant, approximately 8% of the radioactive 
dose  was  recovered  in  urine.  About  5%  of  atogepant  was  recovered  in  the  urine  as  non-metabolised 
parent drug. The majority of the radioactivity (about 81%) was recovered in the faeces. A considerable 
portion of the 50 mg oral dose appears not to have been absorbed. About 42% of the administered dose 
was recovered in the faeces as parent compound. This finding may go along with the classification of 
atogepant  as  low  soluble BCS  class  II  drug.  Data  on  expected  absolute  bioavailability  in  the  relevant 
clinical dose range were not provided, however, respective data are requested. The metabolites of 14C-
atogepant in plasma, urine, and faeces were profiled and characterised. At least 11 metabolites were 
detected in faeces and each represented < 10% of the radioactive dose. Metabolite M23 (dioxygenated 
methylated glucuronide of atogepant) represented approximately 15% of radioactivity exposure (AUC) 
in plasma and was not a long-lasting metabolite. No other metabolite represented more than 1% of the 
circulating radioactivity. 
The focus of multiple dose study P004 was set on tolerability, in particular, any potential influence of 28-
day once daily administration of 170 mg supra-therapeutic doses of AGP on hepatic enzymes, and vital 
signs were monitored. As regards PK, preliminary data obtained from MD of atogepant over 10 days in 
study P002 are largely confirmed. Comparison of AUC and Cmax GMRs between Day 28 and Day 1 does 
not reveal relevant accumulation. 
Taken  together,  it  is  concluded  that  the  PK  profile  of  atogepant  was  adequately  characterised.  Rapid 
absorption  was  observed  after  administration  of  the  HME-OCT  tablet  formulation  with  median  Tmax 
values  ranging  from  1  to  2  hrs.  Compatible  with  the  elimination  half-life  of  about  10-11  hrs,  no 
accumulation  occurred  upon  multiple  once  daily  dosing.  About  dose-proportional  increases  in  plasma 
levels  were  observed  across  the  therapeutic  dose  range.  With  regular  once  daily  administration,  pre-
dose trough levels reach about plateau values on the third day of dosing.

Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Dedicated studies were conducted in hepatically impaired subjects, in the elderly (incl. gender-related 
effects), and in Japanese resp. Chinese subjects as part of AGP’s global development.  
The hepatic impairment study PK-01 examined the impact of various degrees of hepatic impairment after 
administration  of  a  therapeutic  60  mg  single  dose.  Compared  with  participants  with  normal  hepatic 
function, the maximum plasma concentrations of atogepant were generally unchanged in participants 
with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (+9%, -12%, -4% respectively). The overall extent 
of atogepant systemic exposures (AUC) were slightly higher (14% to 38% higher) in participants with 
hepatic impairment as compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. The results of study PK-01 
are adequately reflected in the SmPC, which states in section 4.2 that no dose adjustment is required in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, the use of atogepant should be avoided in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. This is to be seen in the context that the fraction of unbound 
atogepant is about 3-fold higher in severely impaired subjects as compared to matched controls. SmPC 
section 5.2 adequately informs about the increase in unbound atogepant in line with the EMA Guideline 
on hepatic impairment. 
No  dedicated  study  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment  was  conducted.  Mass  balance  study  PK-03 
demonstrated that the renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant. Only 
8%  of  the  total  administered  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  the  urine.  Posology  recommendations  in 
renally impaired subjects were derived from PBPK modelling. As patients with severe renal impairment 
or ESRD (CLcr< 30 mL/min) have not been studied, the use of the lowest effective dose of atogepant 
(10 mg) is recommended in those patients, which appears plausible. Dose modifications, recommended 
for special populations (strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong OATP inhibitors, severe renal impairment), were 
adequately justified. 
Study P003 compared the PK profile of a 40 mg single dose (fasting condition) of atogepant in a group 
of elderly female vs elderly male subjects. The dataset of study P003 was limited consisting of 8 
subjects per group only (2 of these received placebo). Therefore, data should be interpreted with 
caution. However, exposure of atogepant was considerably higher in elderly women as compared to 
elderly men (GMRs: AUC0-∞ 1.10 [0.59, 2.05], Cmax 1.38 [0.73, 2.60]).  
As concerns between-age comparisons, study P003 does not allow for direct comparison of atogepant’s 
PK profile between non-elderly and elderly subjects, because only elderly subjects were recruited. 
Instead, reference was made to historical data obtained from preceding study P002. Data are 
compared between young and elderly male subjects after administration of a single 40 mg dose of 
atogepant. The dataset is very limited, the young vs elderly population is represented by only N=6 
subjects, respectively. The historical data comparison points to an increased AUC in the elderly by 
about 40% as compared to younger male subjects. Larger size population PK analyses, however, 
based on > 1900 subjects per comparison, show only marginal differences in the extent and rate of 
atogepant absorption in relation to gender or age. The PK of atogepant in children was not studied as 
the product is intended for adult subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic Interactions 
The pharmacokinetic interaction potential of atogepant was thoroughly characterised by a number of in 
vivo DDI studies.  
In vitro testing revealed that atogepant is metabolised primarily via CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of 
CYP2D6. Co-administration of atogepant with prototype strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (DDI Study 
PK-02)  increased  atogepantCmax  by  2.15-fold  and  AUC  by  5.5-fold.  Thus,  CYP3A4  inhibition  by 
itraconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors will result in a clinically significant increase in the exposure 
of atogepant. The posology section of the SmPC specifies that the lowest dose of atogepant (10 mg QD) 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 56/136 
 
  
 
 
should  be  used  with  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e.g.,  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  clarithromycin).  The 
proposed  10  mg  dose  corresponds  to  1/6  of  the  regular  60  mg  once  daily  dose.  Given  the  5.5-fold 
increase  in  atogepant’s  AUC,  if  co-administered  itraconazole,  the  proposed  dose  adaptation  for 
concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors appears plausible. 
Transporter assays have shown in vitro that atogepant is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
and OAT1. Inhibition of the AOTP1B1 transporter, which is located basolateral on hepatocyte membranes, 
through  rifampin  (DDI  Study  PK-12)  inhibits  atogepant  metabolism  by  inhibition  of  its  influx  into  the 
hepatocyte.  As  a  result,  atogepant  blood  levels  increase  to  a  clinically  relevant  degree  (2.85-fold  for 
AUC0-24 and 2.23-fold for Cmax). Like in the case of co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
the  recommended  daily  dose  of  atogepant  is  limited  to  10  mg  if  co-administered  with  strong  OATP 
inhibitors. SmCP section 5.2 adequately reflects the data obtained from study PK-12. 
In DDI Study 103, an increase in atogepantCmax and AUC by approximately 4% and 25%, respectively, 
was observed upon co-administration with the P-gp inhibitor quinidine gluconate. Based on these results, 
a  clinically  significant  PK  interaction  between  atogepant,  a  P-gp  substrate,  and  P-pg  inhibitors  is  not 
expected.  It  appears  therefore  justified  not  to  specify  any  dose  modification  for  atogepant  when 
concomitantly administered with P-pg inhibitors. 
Pre-clinical in vitro dissolution testing revealed that dissolution was most rapid and complete under acid 
conditions (0.1 N HCl). The impact of gastric pH and the potential interaction with a pH modifying agent 
(famotidine) was explored within comparative BA Study P008. Indeed, a notable decrease in Cmax (GMR 
0.51) and in AUC (GMR 0.78) was observed after co-administration with the antacid agent famotidine as 
compared to atogepant given alone. 
More  specific  insight  into  pH  dependency  of  atogepant  absorption  was  obtained  from  Study  102 
examining the DDI between atogepant and PPI esomeprazole. A similar decreasing effect on atogepant’s 
plasma level was observed for esomeprazole (Cmax [GMR 0.77], AUC [GMR 0.92]). Furthermore, the 
observed decrease in atogepant’s rate and extent of absorption is compatible with in vitro data showing 
pH  dependency  for  atogepant  dissolution.  Nonetheless,  the  applicant’s  conclusion  that  the  observed 
effect is not considered clinically relevant and does not warrant particular posology recommendations is 
still endorsed. Throughout the phase II/III clinical study programme evaluating 12-week DBT with once 
daily atogepant dosing, concomitant antacid treatment was not prohibited. More than 10% of patients 
participating in pivotal trials actually reported concomitant PPI use (PPI use during DBT: pivotal EM study 
301: 10.8%, pivotal CM study 303: 10.1%). A subgroup analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was 
provided for those subjects receiving a PPI throughout studies 301 / 303. The numerical mean reduction 
of MDs per month in subjects taking antacid medication and the total study population was about similar. 
Migraine prevalence peaks in women during childbearing ages. A DDI study examining the potential IA 
between atogepant (as a potential perpetrator of drug IA) and oral contraceptives is therefore of critical 
importance.  In  DDI  Study  P005,  Nordette-28™  was  adequately  chosen  as  a  two-component  OC 
containing a standard oestrogen (EE) and gestagen (LNG) component. As compared to a SD of the OC 
given alone, multiple therapeutic doses of atogeoant did not relevantly interact with either the oestrogen 
or gestagen component. AUC levels for LNG were slightly increased (LNG: GMR AUC: 1.19), however, 
this is not considered clinically relevant from a safety perspective. Continuous atogepant administration 
did not compromise the contraceptive effect of a standard OC. 
A total of four studies was conducted to examine potential DDI when atogepant is co-administered with 
other  commonly  used  migraine  medications.  Atogepant  is  proposed  for  migraine  prevention.  It  is 
common  to  use  acute  migraine  medication  like  e.g.  acetaminophen  or  NSAIDs,  or  triptans  during 
migraine  prophylactic  treatment  in  case  of  an  acute  migraine  attack.  Accordingly,  throughout  pivotal 
trials 301 (EM) and 303 (CM), concomitant use of any triptan and / or any NSAID agent was permissible. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 57/136 
 
  
 
 
Three of these “migraine DDI” studies concerned the use of acute migraine medications on top of regular 
once daily atogepant use. 
In DDI Study PK-06, no clinically relevant PK interaction between acute medication like acetaminophen 
(1000 mg) or naproxen (500 mg) and atogepant (60 mg) was observed in either direction. Equally, DDI 
Study PK-13 revealed no clinically relevant PK interaction with regular once daily atogepant 60 mg doses 
and intermittent sumatriptan 100 mg doses.  
Ubrogepant  is  approved  for  the  acute  treatment  of  migraine  (labelled  as  50  mg  or  100  mg  dose,  as 
needed). Both atogepant and ubrogepant share the same CGRP antagonist mode of action. In case of 
acute migraine attacks in patients already receiving CGRP-antagonist atogepant for prevention, it may 
be considered intuitive to choose an acute migraine medication with a different mechanism of action, 
e.g.  a  triptan  or  NSAIDs.  However,  there  is  a  certain  likelihood  that  physicians  could  prescribe 
ubrogepant  for  the  acute  treatment  of  breakthrough  migraines  in  patients  already  taking  migraine 
preventives.  In  DDI  study  106,  plasma  levels  under  steady  state  conditions  of  atogepant  alone  were 
compared with steady state atogepant plus intermittent additional single doses of 100 mg ubrogepant 
doses. Intermittent single doses of ubrogepant did not have an impact on steady state atogepant plasma 
levels. However, the rate and extent of absorption after single dose administration of ubrogepant were 
significantly increased if administered on top of regular atogepant dosing as compared to ubrogepant 
given  alone  (Cmax  GMR  125.6  [105.6,  149.5],  AUC  GMR  118.8  [108.7,  129.8]).  Given  the  common 
molecular mode of action between both agents, increased exposure of ubrogepant single doses is to be 
seen in the context safety in healthy subjects resp. patients after administration of supra-therapeutic 
doses. 
In clinical practice, it might occur in severe cases that patients receive two different migraine preventive 
agents at the same time. Throughout pivotal study 301 (EM) the concomitant use of any medication with 
demonstrated  efficacy  in  migraine  prevention  (incl.  e.g.  amitriptyline,  topiramate,  propranolol)  was 
prohibited. This is necessary in order not to confound the net effect of study medication (atogepant / 
placebo). DDI Study PK-14 examined the combined use of atogepant and topiramate. Topiramate is an 
approved  treatment  for  adults  for  prophylaxis  of  migraine  headache  and  is  a  mild  inducer  of  CYP3A4 
activity. The included Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 cover both scenarios that topiramate is added to ongoing 
atogepant therapy (Cohort 1), and Cohort 2 reflects the inverse scenario. 
Additional  60  mg  once  daily  atogepant  administration  in  patients  already  receiving  maintenance 
topiramate (100 mg BID) for migraine prevention has no clinically relevant impact on topiramate’s rate 
and extent of absorption under steady state conditions (Cmax,ss, AUCss). However, atogepant exposure 
under steady state conditions (AUCss) was considerably decreased when regular topiramate (100 mg 
BID) was concomitantly administered (GMR AUCss: 74.55 [68.72, 80.87]). The information provided in 
SmPC section 5.2 that no significant interaction between atogepant and topiramate was observed, it was 
not felt to fully reflect the outcome of study PK-12. It is not considered that the concomitant use of both 
preventive agents should be avoided. However, the change in atogepant exposure (incl. the potential 
mechanism, i.e. CYP3A4 induction through topiramate) was more closely reflected in the SmPC. 
Taken  together,  a  number  of  clinically  relevant  IAs were  explored.  These  mainly  relate  to  changes  in 
atogepant exposure if co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong inhibitors of the OATP 
transporter  (e.g.  rifampin).  Both  IAs  are  adequately  labelled.  No  clinically  relevant  IA  was  observed 
between atogepant and a standard two-component (EE, LNG) oral contraceptive. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  Thorough  QTc  study  CGP-PK-04  appears  well  conducted.  Moxifloxacin  was  included  as  positive 
control  and  yielded  the  expected  results  (QTc  prolongation  by  5  to  10  ms).  This  demonstrates  an 
appropriate sensitivity of the study. Neither visual inspection of the results nor formal statistical analysis 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 58/136 
 
  
 
 
gave any hint that atogepant could prolong the QT interval in a relevant way. As most of the migraine 
patients are females, subgroup analysis by gender (ΔQTcF and ΔΔQTcF estimates incl. 90% CI per time-
point) was presented. 
PK Modelling 
Population PK (PopPK) modelling and simulation studies were conducted at four stages in the late-stage 
development  of  atogepant  for  the  preventive  treatment  of  migraine.  CGP-MS-01  established  a 
preliminary PopPK model based on a pooled dataset from 5 Phase 1 studies. CGP-MS-02, CGP-MS-03 
and 3101-S02-000 each consisted of a reiteration of the PopPK modelling as well as exposure-response 
evaluation of efficacy endpoints in the pivotal clinical studies. In addition to the four PopPK modelling 
studies, a PBPK modelling study (3101-S04-000) was conducted to predict the exposure of atogepant 
following co-administration of weak and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP. 
Modelling revealed that formulation, dose, food status, liver function, concomitant medication and body 
weight were each found to have a statistically significant influence on the atogepant PK. Apparent central 
volume  of  distribution  was  found  to  increase  exponentially  with  body  weight.  Duration  of  zero-order 
absorption  increased  at  higher  doses  and  the  spray  dried  compression  tablet  formulation  had  a  35% 
shorter  duration  compared  to  the  hot  melt  extrusion  oral  compressed  tablet  (HMEOCT)  formulation; 
relative bioavailability was estimated to increase with increasing dose level and was approximately 1.24-
fold higher at the 60 mg dose compared to the 10 mg dose. In addition, administration of atogepant 
following a high fat meal lengthened absorption lag time from 0.28 hours to 0.46 hours. Subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment had a 36.6% lower apparent systemic clearance. In the exposure-response 
modelling,  there  is  no  clear  relationship  between  the  assessed  covariates  of  age,  baseline  monthly 
migraine days, gender, length of migraine history, previous use of migraine preventive medication, and 
use  of  acute  medication  and  the  treatment  effect.  Only  baseline  monthly  migraine  days  affected  the 
reduction  in  monthly  migraine  days,  resulting  in  a  lower  overall  treatment  effect  at  higher  baseline 
values. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A comprehensive PK study programme was provided to delineate the PK profile of atogepant (AGP) 10 
and  60  mg  tablets  subject  of  the  present  MAA.  This  includes  PK  characterisation  in  heathy  subjects 
(including exploration of a suitable tablet formulation, and mass balance), special populations (hepatic 
impairment and others), and a number of relevant DDI studies. 
Taken together, the pharmacokinetics of atogepant were adequately characterised to substantiate the 
proposed  once  daily  dosing  scheme.  Rapid  absorption  was  observed  after  administration  of  the  HME-
OCT tablet formulation with median Tmax values ranging from 1 to 2 hrs. Compatible with the elimination 
half-life  of  about  10-11  hrs,  no  accumulation  occurred  upon  multiple  once  daily  dosing.  About 
dose-proportional  increases  in  plasma  levels  were  observed  across  the  therapeutic  dose  range.  With 
regular once daily administration, pre-dose trough levels reach about plateau values on the third day of 
dosing. 
In terms of primary pharmacology, atogepant was characterised using the standard inhibition of CGRP-
induced  vasodilation  model.  Plausible  results  were  obtained  for  inhibition  of  capsaicin-induced 
vasodilation through atogepant. The Thorough QTc study did not give any hint that a supra-therapeutic 
dose (300 mg) of atogepant could prolong the QT interval in a relevant way. 
Overall, the characterisation of atogepant’s clinical pharmacology profile is adequate.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Primary evidence for efficacy is derived from 2 pivotal studies, Study 3101-301-002 (“Advance” study, 
conducted in the US) for the preventive treatment of migraine in participants with EM and Study 3101-
303-002 (“Progress” study, conducted at 142 sites in the US, Europe, Russia, Japan, Korea and others) 
for the preventive treatment of migraine in participants with chronic migraine (CM).Additional supportive 
data  is  provided  by  dose-finding  Study  CGP-MD-01  for  the  preventive  treatment  of  migraine  in  EM 
patients. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose finding study in EM patients 
A Phase 2/3, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Multiple Dosing Regimens of Oral 
AGN-241689 in Episodic Migraine Prevention (Study CGP-MD-01) 
Does finding study CGP-MD-01 was conducted at 78 clinical centres in the US from Sep 2016 to April 
2018.  It  was  a  Phase  2/3,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group 
study comparing atogepant with placebo for the preventive treatment of migraine in participants with 
EM. A total of 834 eligible participants were randomised (1:2:1:2:1:2 ratio) to 12 weeks of double-blind 
treatment with either atogepant 10 mg QD, atogepant 30 mg QD, atogepant 30 mg BID, atogepant 60 
mg  QD,  atogepant  60  mg  BID,  or  placebo.  To  maintain  the  blind,  investigational  product  will  be 
administered orally twice daily for 12 weeks to all patients. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Primary 
•  Change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MD) across the 12-week DBT. 
Secondary 
•  Change from baseline in mean monthly headache days (HD) across the 12-week DBT; 
• 
Proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days across the 
12-week DBT; 
•  Change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days across the 12-week DBT. 
Efficacy assessments were based on information recorded by the patient. An eDiary was used daily at 
home to collect data on headache duration, headache characteristics, symptoms, and acute medication 
use, which were collectively applied to define migraine, probable migraine, and headache days. 
Efficacy evaluations will be based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population which excludes 
patients never receiving treatment or not having baseline or any post-baseline diary data. Although bias 
may  have  been  introduced,  as  the  number  of  patients  excluded  from  the  mITT  population  due  to 
potentially treatment-related reasons is quite high for MD-01, this issue is not further pursued given the 
supportive character of the study.  
The primary endpoint will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) similar 
to the primary analysis for main studies (see below).  As no estimand is defined for Study MD-01 and 
data are not collected following treatment discontinuation, the MMRM targets a hypothetical estimand 
(effect if all had adhered). Although this is of less relevance for pivotal studies, it can be acceptable for 
this supportive dose finding study. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis (pattern-mixture model approach 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 60/136 
 
  
 
 
based on the copy-reference method (Carpenter et al, 2013)) is conducted and yields similar results as 
the primary analysis. 
The overall type I error rate for multiple comparisons across active treatment doses and the primary and 
secondary efficacy parameters will be adequately controlled at the 0.05 level using a graphical approach 
by Bretz et al (2011). 
Demographics 
Mean  age  was  40.1  years.  Most  patients  were  female  (86.5%).  White  and  Black  or  African  American 
patients  accounted  for  76.1%  and  20.4%  of  the  safety  population,  respectively.  Mean  BMI  was  30.1 
kg/m2.  
Overall, 99.6% of patients in the safety population took concomitant medications during the treatment 
period. The most frequently used concomitant medications (≥ 20% of patients) were ibuprofen (50.8%), 
Thomapyrin  N  (also  known  as  Excedrin  Migraine:  aspirin,  acetaminophen,  caffeine)  (40.7%), 
paracetamol  (also  known  as  acetaminophen;  26.7%),  and  sumatriptan  (20.5%,  [triptans  as  a  class: 
35.4%]). 
As  regards  migraine  history,  50.4%  of  patients  reported  history  of  migraine  without  aura,  22.3%  of 
patients  reported  migraine  with  aura,  and  27.3%  reported  migraine  both  with  and  without  aura.  The 
mean duration of migraine disorder was 19.37 years. Patients reported an average of 7.4 migraine days 
per month and 9.5 headache days per month in the 3 months prior to screening. At screening, nearly all 
patients  (97.6%)  reported  current  treatment  for  acute  migraine,  the  most  common  of  which  were 
NSAIDs (67.5%) and triptans (36.2%). Only 28.1% of patients reported previous migraine prophylactic 
treatment. 
Disposition of subjects 
A  total  of  834  patients  were  randomised  into  the  study  and  825  (98.9%)  received  study  treatment. 
Overall, 82% of patients completed the 12-week treatment period, and completion rates were similar 
across  the  6  treatment  groups  (range  78.5%  to  87.7%).  The  most  common  reason  for  premature 
discontinuation during the treatment phase was withdrawal of consent (6.7% overall). 
Efficacy results 
Statistically  significant  higher  response  rates  were  observed  for  all  treatment  arms  of  atogepant 
compared with placebo for the primary endpoint (P1) of mean monthly migraine days across the 12-
week  treatment  period  after  multiplicity  adjustment.  No  clear  dose  response  was  evident  in  the  P1 
results.

Statistically  significant  higher  response  rates  were  observed  for  all  treatment  arms  of  atogepant 
compared with placebo for the 1st secondary endpoint (S1) of change from baseline in mean monthly 
headache days across the 12-week treatment period, with a similar magnitude of change in headache 
days across the treatment arms.

The proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days (S2) was higher 
in all atogepant treatment arms than in the placebo group (odds ratios ranging from 1.42 to 2.03), and 
the  comparison  with  placebo  was  statistically  significant  after  multiplicity  adjustment  for  both  BID 
treatment arms.

across the 12-week treatment period (mITT population), Study CGP-MD-01 
A greater reduction from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days (S3) was observed for all 
atogepant treatment arms compared with placebo (LSMD range -1.11 to -1.44 compared with placebo).

In terms of acute medication reduction, treatment differences were statistically significant for the BID 
treatment arms of atogepant compared with placebo after multiplicity adjustment (p ≤ 0.0339). 
However, the treatment differences in the QD arms did not achieve statistical significance after 
multiplicity adjustment because the results for the 50% responder endpoint (S2), which were placed 
higher in the testing hierarchy, did not achieve statistically significant separation from placebo for the 
corresponding doses.

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Studies  301  and  303  were  12-week,  Phase  3,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled,  parallel-group  studies  comparing  atogepant  with  placebo  for  the  preventive  treatment  of 
migraine in participants with EM (Study 301; atogepant 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg QD) and in participants 
with CM (Study 303; atogepant 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD). The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies 
was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period.

Methods 
Study Participants 
Study 3101-301-002 (Episodic Migraine) 
The participants in Study 301 were generally representative of patients with EM in the general population 
with respect to demographics and baseline disease characteristics (Katsarava 2012). 
The study enrolled participants 18 to 80 years of age who had a history of migraine with onset before 
age 50 years, with or without aura for at least 1 year consistent with a diagnosis according to the ICHD-
3  criteria  (ICHD-3  2018).  Participants  must  have  experienced  4  to  14  migraine  days  per  month  on 
average in the 3 months before screening (Visit 1) in the investigator's judgement. During the 28-day 
baseline period, participants had to experience 4 to 14 migraine days per electronic diary (eDiary). 
Randomisation  was  stratified  by  prior  exposure  (yes,  no)  to  a  migraine  prevention  medication  with 
proven efficacy. 
Study 3101-303-002 (Chronic Migraine) 
The study enrolled participants 18 to 80 years of age who had at least a 1-year history of CM consistent 
with  a  diagnosis  according  to  the  ICHD-3  criteria  (ICHD-3  2018)  with  onset  before  age  50  years. 
Participants must have experienced, on average, ≥ 15 headache days per month in the 3 months prior 
to Visit 1 in the opinion of the investigator, ≥ 15 headache days during the 4-week screening/baseline 
period per the eDiary, and≥ 8 days during the 4-week screening/baseline period that qualify as being a 
migraine day per the eDiary. 
Treatments 
The HME-OCT tablet formulation (as described in section 3.3.1.1) at dose strengths of 10 mg, 30 mg, 
and 60 mg was used in phase II/III trials. Atogepant treatment arms examined once daily QD 10 mg, 
30 mg, and 60 mg doses in EM study 301, and the highest 60 mg dose in CM study 303, administered 
either as QD 60 mg or 30 mg BID. 
There  were  virtually  no  restrictions  with  regard  to  medication  to  be  taken  for  acute  migraine  attacks 
throughout  studies  301/303.  Patients  were  allowed  to  take  any  triptan,  ergot  derivative,  opioid,  any 
other form of analgesic (incl. acetaminophen), any NSAID, or any antiemetic agent.  
However,  there  were  differences  between  EM  study  301  and  CM  study  303  in  terms  of  concomitant 
migraine  preventive  medication.  In  EM  study  301,  medications  with  demonstrated  efficacy  for  the 
prevention of migraine (e.g., amitriptyline, topiramate, propranolol) were prohibited within 30 days prior 
to Visit 1 and throughout the study period. Injectable monoclonal antibodies blocking the CGRP pathway 
(e.g.,  Aimovig,  Emgality,  Ajovy)  within  6  months  prior  to  Visit  1  and  through  the  study  period,  were 
prohibited.  
In CM study 303, participants taking one medication with demonstrated efficacy for the prevention of 
migraine may be randomised provided that in the opinion of the investigator: 
•  Dose has been stable and the medication has been well-tolerated for at least 12 weeks prior to 
Visit 1 AND 
• 
Participant is willing and able to maintain at a stable dose and dosage regimen during the study, 
which should be assessed to ensure compliance at each study visit 
Enrolment of participants with current use of a migraine prevention medication will be capped at ~15% 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 66/136 
 
  
 
 
Like in study 301, injectable monoclonal antibodies blocking the CGRP pathway (e.g., Aimovig, Emgality, 
Ajovy) within 6 months prior to Visit 1 and throughout the study period were prohibited. 
Objectives 
EM Study 301 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of atogepant 10 mg, atogepant 30 mg, and atogepant 60 
mg for the prevention of migraine in participants with EM. 
To prospectively test for superiority of atogepant 10 mg, atogepant 30 mg, and atogepant 60 
mg versus placebo for the prevention of migraine in participants with EM. 
Clinical Hypothesis 
In individuals with EM, at least one of the atogepant doses, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg, is superior to 
placebo as measured by the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week 
treatment period. 
CM Study 303 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of atogepant 30 mg BID and atogepant 60 mg once daily 
for the prevention of CM. 
To prospectively test for superiority of atogepant (30 mg BID and atogepant 60 mg once daily) 
versus placebo for the prevention of CM. 
Clinical Hypothesis 
In participants with CM, at least one dose of atogepant (30 mg BID and atogepant 60 mg once daily) is 
superior to placebo as measured by the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 
12-week treatment period. 
For  EU  filing,  studies  301  and  303  target  an  estimand  addressing  the  effect  regardless  of  treatment 
discontinuation  and  acute  migraine  treatment  (treatment  policy  strategy)  and  had  other  preventive 
migraine treatment not been available (hypothetical strategy). Although it can be argued whether it is 
reasonable  to  apply  a  hypothetical  strategy  for  ‘starting  new  preventive  migraine  treatment’,  the 
targeted estimand is agreed, as in both studies the number of patients that have started new preventive 
migraine treatment is very limited and use of alternative strategies to handle this intercurrent event is 
unlikely  to  relevantly  change  conclusions.  Furthermore,  the  Copy-Reference  analysis  (pre-planned 
sensitivity  analysis)  as  well  as  the  requested  and  provided  additional  analysis  (Jump-to-Reference 
analysis) can be interpreted to target estimands that use alternative strategies to handle the intercurrent 
event ‘starting new preventive migraine treatment’. Labelling the targeted estimand as ‘Off-treatment 
Hypothetical Estimand’ is unusual and somewhat confusing, as the terms off-treatment and hypothetical 
relate to different concepts and it is unclear from the name to which intercurrent events these refer.

Migraine Day 
A migraine day is defined as any calendar day on which a headache occurs which meets criteria A, B, 
and C OR meets criteria D and E, as listed below, as per participant eDiary.  Calendar days begin at 
midnight and last until 11:59 PM (23:59). 
OR 
Headache Day 
A headache day is defined as any calendar day on which headache pain lasting 2 hours or longer occurs 
unless an acute headache medication (e.g., ibuprofen, triptan) was used after the start of the headache, 
in which case no minimum duration will be specified.  
Sample size 
For Study 301/302, a total sample size of 218/250 per treatment group will provide at least 98%/96% 
power to detect the treatment difference between each of the 3/2 doses (assumed equally effective) and 
placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint (assumptions based on results from other prevention studies). 
This sample size was selected to provide sufficient power for the first 3 secondary endpoints as well and 
takes multiplicity control into account. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 69/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Participants  will  be  randomised  to  the  different  treatment  arms  in  an  equal  ratio  using  a  centralised 
IWRS. Approximately 70% of randomised participants will have taken at least 1 prior migraine prevention 
medication with proven efficacy. Randomisation is stratified by prior exposure to a migraine prevention 
medication for study 301 (EM) and region, acute headache medication overuse, and migraine prevention 
medication  exposure  (further  stratified  based  on  the  number  of  medications  failed  with  unique 
mechanisms of action for study 303 (CM)). 
A double-dummy design will be used to maintain study blind. Atogepant tablets and matching placebo 
will be provided in identical blister cards to maintain masking of the study. 
Statistical methods 
In line with the estimand, for EU filing, the Off-treatment Hypothetical Estimand (OTHE) population is 
used for analysis. It excludes randomised participants never receiving treatment or not having baseline 
or any post-baseline diary data (regardless of whether on or off study treatment). Data collected after 
treatment discontinuation is  included  in  evaluations  and  data  collected  after new  preventive  migraine 
treatment  was  started  is  excluded.  While  inclusion  of  off-treatment  data  is  supported,  exclusion  of 
randomised patients from the analysis population is generally not. However, although around 1 to 4 % 
of rand. patients were excluded from the OTHE population in both studies (majority due to missing post-
baseline assessments), given the clear efficacy results of studies 301 and 303, it is highly unlikely that 
including all randomised patients will relevantly change conclusions. Hence, use of the OTHE population 
is supported.  For US filling, the mITT population excluding all randomised patients never receiving study 
treatment or not having baseline or any post-baseline data (on study treatment) will be used. 
The  primary  endpoint  will  be  analysed  using  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM).  The 
response variable is the change from baseline to each post-baseline month in monthly migraine days. 
The  model  will  include  treatment,  visit,  stratification  factors,  and  treatment  by  visit  interaction  as 
categorical fixed effects as well as baseline and baseline-by visit interaction as covariates. Within-patient 
correlation will be modelled using an unstructured covariance matrix. Contrasts will be constructed to 
obtain the average treatment effects across the 12-week treatment period to compare each treatment 
group vs placebo. Although this analysis with its underlying missing-at-random (MAR) assumption is less 
aligned to the targeted estimand (unless no data are missing) as compared to imputation approaches 
based on placebo data (CR or J2R analysis), there are minimal to none differences in results for the CR 
and J2R analysis as compared to the primary analysis supporting overall robustness of results. Hence it 
is agreed to report results of the primary analysis in the SmPC. 
Only few daily eDiary data are missing and impact of these on availability of primary/secondary endpoints 
as well as on results is negligible. Continuous secondary endpoints will be analysed similar to the primary 
endpoint.  The  50%  responder  endpoint,  defined  as  a  participant  with  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from 
baseline in the 3-month average of monthly migraine days, will be assessed for each individual. A logistic 
regression model will be used to analyse the 50% responders across the 12-week treatment period.  
The overall familywise error rate (FWER) will be controlled at α = 0.05 for the primary and secondary 
endpoints between each dose level of atogepant vs placebo using a graphical approach with weighted-
Bonferroni  test  procedure  (Bretz  2009).  For  the  primary  and  first  three  secondary  endpoints  this 
approach essentially corresponds to sequential testing vs placebo within each atogepant dose group with 
splitted alpha.

Results 
Participant flow 
Study 301 in EM population 
A total of 910 participants were randomised and included in the intent-to-treat population of Study 301. 
Overall, 805 participants completed the 12-week double-blind treatment period, and completion rates 
were similar across the 4 treatment groups (range 86.8% to 90.1% for all randomised patients). 
A  total  of  88.5%  of  all  randomised  participants  completed  the  study  and  11.5%  of  participants 
discontinued  the  study  in  the  double-blind  treatment  period.  The  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuation, based on the total number of participants, was withdrawal by subject (3.8%), adverse 
events (2.7%), and protocol deviations (2.6%).

Study 303 in CM population 
Overall, 1489 subjects were screened for eligibility at 142 sites in the US, UK, Canada, China, CZ, DK, 
FR,  DE,  IT,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  PL,  Russian  Federation,  ES,  SE,  and  Taiwan.  Of  these,  N=778 
subjects were randomised. 
The majority of randomised subjects (89.2%) completed the double-blind treatment period. The main 
reasons for discontinuation reported during DBT were AE and withdrawal by subject.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Change from Baseline in Mean Monthly Migraine Days Across the 12-Week Treatment Period 
In both studies 301 303, greater reductions from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 
12-week treatment period were observed for each of the atogepant doses (10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg 
QD  in  Study  301  and  30  mg  BID  and  60  mg  QD  in  Study  303)  compared  with  placebo  and  were 
statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment.

At Least a 50% Reduction in 3-Month Average of Monthly Migraine Days 
In  both  studies,  the  proportion  of  participants  with  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from  baseline  in  mean 
monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period was greater for each of the atogepant doses

Time Course of Efficacy 
Efficacy Across the 12-Week Treatment Period by 4-Week Interval 
The time course of efficacy based on the least square mean change from baseline in the number of MDs 
during  DBT  in  Studies  301  and  303  is  presented  in  the  figure  below.  In  both  studies,  each  of  the 
atogepant doses (10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg QD in EM Study 301 and 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD in CM 
Study  303)  separate  from  placebo,  starting  with  the  first  month  of  treatment  (Weeks  1  to  4),  and 
provided similar reductions in the number of monthly migraine days during the 12-week BDT. In Study 
301, a dose-response relationship was evident, particularly during the first month, with the atogepant 
60 mg QD dose providing a numerically greater reduction in the number of monthly migraine days than 
the 10 mg and 30 mg QD doses.

days (MMRM) during the double-blind treatment period – individual studies 3101-301-002 
and 3101-303-002 (OTHE population) 
Additional Health Outcomes Measures 
A number of additional health outcomes measures were common to both Studies 301 and 303, including 
the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC),  Patient  Satisfaction  with  Study  Medication  (PSSM), 
Work  Productivity  and  Activity  Impairment  Questionnaire:  Migraine  v2.0  (WPAI:MIGRAINE),  Migraine 
Disability  Assessment  (MIDAS),  Patient  Global Impression  of  Severity  (PGI-S),  and  Activity  Level  and 
Limitation. In addition, the MSQ v2.1, AIM-D, and HIT-6 were also administered at multiple time points 
in the study to construct additional endpoints. 
Overall, results for these additional health outcomes measures were consistent with the results of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for both studies, with numerically greater improvements or 
greater  reductions  (i.e.,  improvement)  from  baseline  observed  for  each  of  the  atogepant  treatment 
groups compared with placebo for the majority of measures.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, sex, race, baseline BMI, baseline monthly MDs, exposure to 
migraine  prevention  medication  with  proven  efficacy,  and  migraine  prevention  medication  failures  for 
the EM and CM studies. Specifically for Study 303, further subgroup analyses were conducted by region, 
acute  medication  overuse,  current  use  of  migraine  prevention  medication  for  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint and each of the 3 clinical secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Subgroup Analysis per Baseline Monthly MDs 
In  the  total  pooled  population  across  Studies  301  and  MD-01  (atogepant  QD  and  placebo  treatment 
groups), baseline monthly migraine days was < 8 days for 54.2% of participants and ≥ 8 days for 45.8% 
of participants. 
Figure 9: Forest plot of subgroup analysis for change from baseline in mean monthly 
migraine days across the 12-week treatment period by baseline monthly migraine days – 
pooled studies 301 and md-01 (efficacy analysis population) 
In Study 303 (atogepant 30 mg BID, atogepant 60 mg QD, and placebo treatment groups), the mean 
baseline  number  of  migraine  days  was  18.9  days.  For  CM  Study  303,  although  a  numerically  greater 
treatment effect was observed for participants with baseline monthly migraine days < 18 days compared 
with participants with baseline monthly migraine days ≥ 18 days, the 95% CIs overlapped.

Persistence of Efficacy 
The long-term studies of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine in participants with CM are 
ongoing. No study results are available. 
The long-term efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine in participants with EM was 
evaluated in Study 3101-302-002.

Long-term Study 302 in EM 
A Phase 3, Multi-centre, Randomised, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety 
and Tolerability of Oral Atogepant for the Prevention of Migraine in Participants with 
Episodic Migraine (Study 3101-302-002) 
Study 302 was a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, 52-week, long-term safety study conducted at 
111 centres in the United States (111 centres screened participants and 106 centres randomised at least 
1 participant). Participants were randomised in a 5:2 ratio to one of the following treatment groups:  
• 
• 
atogepant 60 mg once daily (n = 546) or  
oral SOC migraine preventive medication (n = 198).  
All  participants  randomised  to  oral  SOC  migraine  preventive  medication  were  treated  with  an  oral 
medication recognised as safe and effective for the preventive treatment of migraine. 
The following 2 groups of participants were eligible to participate in this study: 
•  De Novo Participants: participants with no previous exposure to atogepant and who met the 
inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria 
•  Study  MD-01  Completers:  participants  who  completed  Study  CGP-MD-01  (Visit  8)  without 
significant protocol  deviations  (e.g.,  noncompliance to  protocol  required  procedures)  and  who 
met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria 
Study MD-01 Completers experienced a gap of at least 6 months from the time of completion of Study 
MD-01 to the start of this long-term safety study. Thus, they had to re-establish study eligibility and had 
their baseline migraine days re-established (completed at least 20 out of 28 days in the eDiary) during 
the  screening  period  (but  the  migraine  days  were  not  used  as  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  for 
randomisation). 
Of  the  543  participants  in  the  atogepant  group  for  the  safety  population,  428  participants  and  362 
participants received atogepant for at least 180 days and at least 360 days, respectively. 
Efficacy  endpoints  for  long-term  efficacy  evaluation  were  not  classified  as  primary,  secondary,  or 
additional. Efficacy variables include frequency of migraine days, headache days, acute medication use 
days, and health outcomes assessments. All efficacy analyses were performed using the modified intent 
to  treat  (mITT)  population,  consisting  of  all  randomised  participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
atogepant, had an evaluable baseline period of eDiary data and had at least 1 evaluable postbaseline 4-
week period of eDiary data. The mITT population was defined only for the atogepant arm, as no clinical 
efficacy  measurements  were  collected  from  participants  in  the  oral  standard  of  care  (SOC)  migraine 
preventive  medication  arm.  The  purpose  of  the  SOC  arm  is  to  collect  comparative  safety  data  for  52 
weeks.

Figure 13: Least square mean (±SE) of change from baseline in the number of monthly 
migraine days (MMRM) during the treatment period (mITT Population), study 302 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
AbbVie Inc. has developed atogepant as an IR tablet in 2 dose strengths containing 10 mg, resp. 60 mg 
atogepant which is proposed to be indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 
migraine days (MD) per month. By using the broad term “migraine” in the proposed indication wording, 
this is understood to comprise both episodic (EM, Episodic Migraine) and chronic (CM, Chronic migraine) 
forms  of  the  disease.  Another  member  of  the  gepant  family  (rimegepant)  was  recently  approved  for 
prophylactic  treatment  of  episodic  migraine.  Hence,  atogepant  is  introduced  as  the  first  orally 
administered CGRP antagonist for use across the full spectrum of migraine preventive treatment. 
The clinical data package is comprehensive and adequate. It comprises phase II/III dose finding, pivotal 
efficacy/ safety studies in both the EM and CM population, and additional long-term tolerability studies, 
which also provide data to support maintenance of effect. 
Primary evidence for efficacy is derived from 2 pivotal studies, Study 3101-301-002 (“Advance” study, 
conducted in the US) for EM prevention and Study 3101-303-002 (“Progress” study, conducted at 142 
sites in the US, Europe, Russia, Japan, Korea and others) for the preventive treatment of CM. Additional 
supportive data are provided by dose-finding Study CGP-MD-01 for EM prophylaxis.  
Furthermore,  two  long-term  open-label  studies  in  EM  (Study  3101-302-002)  [52-week  duration]  and 
Study  3101-309-002  [40-week  duration])  were  conducted.  Persistence  of  efficacy  data  in  EM  were 
obtained  from  long  term  study  302  including  de  novo  participants  and  patients  who  completed  dose 
finding Study CGP-MD-01. In long-term study 309, including rollover patients, who completed EM study 
301, maintenance of effect was not recorded. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Studies 301 and 303 were 12-week, Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group  studies  comparing  atogepant  with  placebo  for  the  preventive  treatment  of  migraine  in 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 86/136 
 
  
 
 
 
participants with EM (Study 301; atogepant 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg QD) and in participants with CM 
(Study 303; atogepant 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD). The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was 
the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period (DBT). 
Essential  features  of  prevention  studies  301  and  303  are  accordant  with  EU  Guideline  provisions 
(CPMP/EWP/788/01  Rev.1).  The  frequency  of  migraine  attacks  is  documented  during  an  initial 
prospective  1-month  baseline  period.  Additionally,  eligible  subjects  had  to  present  with  pre-defined 
frequency of migraine attacks per month within the last 3 months prior to Screening visit. The double-
blind  treatment  period  covers  a  12  week  duration.  During  double-blind  treatment,  subjects  were 
randomised to receive either atogepant or placebo, an active control arm was not included. Large and 
highly variable placebo effects have been observed in past migraine prevention trials. Therefore, placebo 
control is indispensable. An active control arm would have provided added information to contextualise 
the  clinical  effect  of  the  test  medication,  however,  is  not  considered  essential  from  the  regulatory 
perspective.  
The designs of studies 301 and 303 are similar. The major difference between the two studies lies in the 
target population (EM vs CM) and the atogepant dose range that was tested. While all once daily dose 
arms examined in dose finding study CGP-MD-01 (10 mg QD, 30 mg QD, 60 mg QD) were taken over 
into pivotal EM study 301, only the highest total daily dose of 60 mg atogepant (tested for the QD and 
BID  dosing  interval)  was  carried  forward  to  the  pivotal  CM  study  303.  This  may  be  explained  by  the 
expectation that higher dose requirements are given in the more severely affected CM population. In 
essence, however, the lower 10 and 30 mg daily doses were not tested in CM patients. The posology 
section  of  the  proposed  SmPC  does  not  differentiate  between  EM  and  CM.  The  general  dose 
recommendation is 60 mg atogepant per day. Only in case of concomitant use of either strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors  or  strong  OATP  inhibitors  and  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  the  dose  should  be 
reduced to 10 mg QD. 
Inclusion criteria applied throughout pivotal studies align with the standard ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria 
(ICHD-3, 2018). In EM study 301, a minimum number of 4 MDs per month at baseline is required for 
study eligibility. Subjects with medication overuse (triptans > 10 days/month, or simple analgesics > 15 
days/month etc.) were excluded. Eligible EM patients must not have > 15 headache days (HD) per month 
on average across the 3 month prior to Visit 1. Conversely, in CM study 303, a minimum number of > 
15 HDs per month during the 3-month prior to screening and during the 1-month baseline is required 
for study eligibility. During the baseline period, > 8 of these have to qualify as a MD. Other than in EM 
study  301,  subjects  with  medication  overuse  were  not  excluded  in  the  CM  population  of  study  303. 
Medication  overuse  is  prevalent  across  CM  patients.  Inclusion  of  medication  overuse  is  therefore 
considered to adequately reflect the target population. 
Throughout pivotal studies 301 / 303 for prevention of EM resp. CM any medication to be taken for acute 
migraine attacks (incl. triptans, NSAIDs, acetaminophen etc.) was permissible. As concerns concomitant 
preventive migraine medication, there were differences between the EM and the CM study. While any 
medication  with  demonstrated  efficacy  for  the  prevention  of  migraine  (e.g.  amitriptyline,  topiramate, 
propranolol etc.) was prohibited in EM study 301, participants of CM study 303 could take one preventive 
medication  with  demonstrated  efficacy,  provided  that  the  dose  has  been  stable  for  at least 12  weeks 
prior  to  Visit  1.  Enrolment  of  participants  with  current  use  of  a  migraine  prevention  medication  was 
capped  at  ~15%.  There  is  no  objection  against  allowing  concomitant  use  of  another  stably  dosed 
preventive medication on top of atogepant in study 303. This is considered to reflect clinical practice in 
the more severely affected CM population. At study entry, about 83% of CM subjects reported the use 
of preventive medication in the past. 
In both studies, injectable monoclonal antibodies blocking the CGRP pathway (e.g., Aimovig, Emgality, 
Ajovy) within 6 months prior to Visit 1 and throughout the study period, were prohibited. It is unclear

whether there is any space for further improvement in patients already receiving biological CGRP ABs. 
Exclusion of subjects with concomitant injectable CGRP antibodies is therefore acceptable. 
Standard and clinically meaningful efficacy endpoints were tested. The change from baseline in mean 
monthly  migraine  days  across  the  12-week  DBT  was  defined  as  primary  endpoint.  Further  secondary 
endpoints were tested for superiority of atogepant over placebo while controlling for multiplicity in studies 
301/303. The three most relevant was the change from baseline in mean monthly headache days across 
the 12-week DBT [S1], change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days across the 12-
week [S2], and ≥ 50% reduction in 3-month average of monthly MDs as responder analysis [S3]. 
Factually, throughout dose finding study MD-01 and pivotal studies 301/303 identical efficacy endpoints 
were  applied  in  terms  of  migraine  resp.  headache  days.  Like  in  dose  finding  study  MD-01  (after 
implementation  of  SAP  Addendum,  2019-04-11),  migraine  days  (MD)  in  the  narrow  sense  (per  IHS 
Treatment  Guideline)  and  probable  migraine  days  (PMD)  are  grouped  together  and  summarised  into 
“Migraine days” in the definition of the primary endpoint of studies 301/303.  
Definition of a MD in the narrow sense combines criteria as laid down in the IHS Guidelines and diagnostic 
criteria ICHD-3. A minimum 2-hour headache duration was defined by the applicant for all phase II/III 
studies  (unless  acute  medication  was  taken  earlier).  Therefore,  it  differs  from  IHS  Guidelines  of  the 
International  Headache  Society  that  issued  two  guidance  documents  for  preventive  treatment  of 
migraine attacks: The first one for preventive treatment in CM patients (Tassorelli C et al. 2018), and 
the  second  one  for  preventive  treatment  in  EM  patients  (Diener  HC  et  al.  2020).  These  guidance 
documents specify different definitions of what constitutes a “Migraine Day”. While in the EM population 
a  MD  is  defined  as  a  day  with  headache  lasting  at  least  30  minutes  without  intake  of  analgesics,  the 
guidance  for  chronic  migraine  requires  the  headache  to  last  for  at  least  4  hours  (all  other  criteria 
identical).  The  applicant’s  defined  minimum  2-hour  duration  of  headache  is  therefore  somewhat  in-
between  the  two  guidance  documents.  The  advantage  of  defining  a  uniform  endpoint  across  trials  is 
acknowledged. Furthermore, current guidelines recommend early intervention in acute attacks, i.e. to 
take  acute  migraine  medication  early  after  the  onset  migraine  headache.  By  early  intervention,  the 
practical sequelae of differences in minimum headache duration are unclear anyway.  
Combined measurement of MDs and PMDs (grouped together as primary endpoint “MDs”) is acceptable 
given the variable character of migraine. Symptomatology may vary from one attack to the following 
within one subject and from one subject to another. It can therefore be expected that on some days not 
all diagnostic criteria may formally be fulfilled to qualify for a MD in the narrow sense. A reduction of 
these probable MDs as compared to baseline is, however, still regarded as a relevant clinical benefit. 
Apart  from  clinical  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  as  outlined  above,  additional  health-related 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  measured,  like  the  Migraine  Specific  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire 
(MSQ)  v2.1,  the  Activity  Impairment  in  Migraine-Diary  (AIM-D)  Performance  of  Daily  Activities  and 
Physical Impairment Domain Scores, and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). 
Overall,  it  is  concluded  that  standard  endpoints  were  defined  in  pivotal  studies  301/303  that  are 
considered  to  adequately  measure  the  efficacy  of  atogepant  across  the  full  spectrum  of  episodic  and 
chronic  migraine  as  compared  to placebo.  Specified  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  adequately  define 
the proposed target population in line with current ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria. Essential design features 
of pivotal studies 301/303 are concordant with EU Guideline provisions. There are no major objections 
related to the design or conduct of pivotal studies in support of the atogepant MAA.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase II/III Dose-finding Study MD-01 
The  total  daily  dose  range  tested  in  dose-finding  study  MD-01  ranged  from  10  mg  to  a  maximum 
atogepant dose of 120 mg per day. Apart from dose variation, study MD-01 also examined two different 
dosing  intervals,  i.e.  once  daily  vs  twice  daily  regimens.  The  results  of  study  MD-01  demonstrated 
atogepant  10  mg  QD,  30  mg  QD,  60  mg  QD,  30  mg  BID,  and  60  mg  BID  were  superior  to  placebo 
(statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment), as measured by the reduction in mean monthly 
MDs across the 12-week DBT. Secondary endpoints like reduction of HDs, responder analyses of > 50% 
reduction of MDs, and reduction of acute migraine medication use go along the results obtained for the 
primary  endpoint.  The  positive  effect  of  atogepant  in  prevention  of  EM  did  not  reveal  a  clear  dose 
response relationship. Therefore, the sponsor’s decision to take over all three QD dose arms (10 mg, 30 
mg, 60 mg) into pivotal EM study 301 appears plausible. The effect achieved with twice daily dosing of 
atogepant was noticeable. Across all efficacy endpoints, the results obtained with 30 mg BID atogepant 
were numerically more favourable as compared to the 60 mg QD dose arm. This was not further explored 
in EM study 301, which followed dose finding study MD-01, however, a BID dose arm was re-explored 
in the pivotal CM study 303, which was initiated later on. 
Pivotal Studies 301/303: Baseline 
Pivotal studies 301 (US) and 303 (multiregional incl. US, UK, Canada, China, CZ, DK, FR, DE, IT, Japan, 
Republic of Korea, PL, Russian Federation, ES, SE, and Taiwan) were conducted in different regions. The 
population of study 303 was composed of 35% European, 30% North American, and 35% East Asian 
participants. Demographic features like age (42 years) and gender proportions (87-88% female) were 
essentially similar between the two studies. There are no issues raised with regard to transferability of 
study results across regions. 
Baseline characteristics of migraine reflect the differences between the EM (study 301) and CM (study 
303) population. The more severe disease burden in CM participants (Safety Population) is reflected by 
the higher portion of subjects with previous migraine prevention attempts (82.9% vs 70.3% in EM), the 
higher number of MDs per month (16.0 vs 7.4 in EM), and the higher number of monthly HDs (21.1 vs 
9.3  in  EM).  The  higher  number  of  monthly  MDs  and  HDs  in  CM  subjects  goes  along  with  the  higher 
portion of CM subjects usually taking triptans for acute attacks (72.2% in CM, 48.8% in EM). 
A considerable portion of included subjects was overweight. In the total safety population, mean baseline 
weight was 84.20 kg and mean baseline BMI was 30.56 kg/m2. Overall, 25% of participants weighed ≥ 
96.4 kg and 25% of participants had a BMI ≥ 34.96 kg/m2. Further reflection is requested to justify that 
the included study population reflects the target population in terms of BMI. 
Pivotal Studies 301/303: Disposition 
Completion rates were high in study 301 (total completion 88.5%) and similar across treatment arms 
(ranging  from  86.8%  for  atogepant  10  mg  to  90.1%  for  the  placebo  arm,  related  to  all  randomised 
participants).  The  rates  of  subjects  discontinuing  for  adverse  events  were  about  equal  between  the 
highest 60 mg atogepant dose arm (2.6%) and placebo subjects (2.7%). Lack of efficacy was reported 
very  rarely  as  reason  for  discontinuation  with  only  one  placebo  subject  and  one  participant  receiving 
atogepant 60 mg (0.4% each). Like in study 301, the overall completion rate was high in CM study 303 
(89.2%). Completion rates for DBT were almost identical across the atogepant 30 mg BID, atogepant 
60 mg QD, and placebo arm (89-90%). 
In studies 301 and 303, significant Protocol deviations mainly refer to “Exclusion criteria met” (4.5 to 
7.3%), “Prohibited concomitant medication taken” (301: 9% for placebo / atogepant 30 mg QD), and 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 89/136 
 
  
 
 
“Study procedure not performed per protocol” (13.2% in study 303). Protocol deviations did not impact 
data integrity. 
Pivotal Studies 301/303: Primary endpoint 
The difference in disease severity between the EM and CM population is documented by the number of 
baseline mean monthly MDs. While EM patients present with 7-8 MDs per month, about 18-19 MDs are 
reported for CM patients during the 28-day baseline period. Like it could be observed in previous migraine 
prevention trials, a considerable placebo response was observed in both populations. Both EM and CM 
placebo patients reduced the number of mean monthly MDs by up to one third (EM: -2.5 MD [-32.8%], 
CM: -5.1 MD [-26.9%]). Superiority over placebo was shown for all atogepant treatment arms across 
the two trials. A numerical dose-response relationship was evident for the change from baseline in mean 
monthly  MDs  across  the  12-week  treatment  period  in  Study  301,  with  greater  reductions  seen  with 
increasing atogepant dose from 10 to 60 mg QD (LSMD over placebo: 10 mg QD: -1.22, 30 mg QD: -
1.38, 60 mg QD: -1.66). The placebo-corrected mean reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine 
days observed with the atogepant 60 mg QD dose was the same in the EM and CM studies (LSMD of –
1.66 in both Study 301 and Study 303). 
Apart from testing dose response in EM study 301 across the once daily 10, 30, 60 mg dose range, the 
effect of changing the dosing interval from once daily to twice daily was examined for the highest 60 mg 
daily dose in the CM population. A noticeable difference was observed in favour of the twice daily dosing 
schedule in terms of the net difference over placebo for the reduction of mean monthly MDs (Study 303: 
LSMD over placebo: 30 mg BID: -2.24, 60 mg QD: -1.66). The favourable treatment effect of the 30 mg 
BID regime (as compared to 60 mg QD) was analogously observed in phase II/III dose finding study 
MD-01  (reduction  in  mean  monthly  MDs  from  baseline:  30  mg  BID:  -4.0,  60  mg  QD:  -3.56).  It  also 
translates into most relevant secondary endpoints, like reduction of HDs, reduction of acute medication 
use, and 50% response rates. Further plausibility for the favourable outcome in the 30 mg BID treatment 
arm is provided by PK study P002. In study P002, plasma levels were compared for different atogepant 
doses  after  repetitive  dosing  over  10  days.  C24  hrs  trough  values  after  30  mg  BID  dosing  were 
remarkably high, higher than after 100 mg once daily dosing and almost reaching the level of the 170 
mg once daily regime.  
Both  in  EM  study  301  and  CM  study  303,  subjects  were  followed  up  for  another  4-week  period  after 
termination  of  the  12-week  DBT  or  early  discontinuation.  According  to  the  Schedule  of  Procedures  of 
Study 301, participants’ eDiary entries regarding headache were evaluated only in those patients who 
terminated  early,  but  not  in  patients  who  completed  the  entire  12-week  DBT.  Hence,  no  data  were 
provided  on  potential  rebound  of  migraine  after  cessation  of  study  medication  in  (all)  participants  of 
studies 301/303. 
Pivotal Studies: Secondary endpoints 
A Headache Day (HD) is defined as any calendar day on which headache pain lasting 2 hours or longer 
occurs  unless  an  acute  headache  medication  (e.g.  ibuprofen,  triptan)  was  used  after  the  start  of  the 
headache.  As  such,  a  HD  captures  days  with  headache  irrespective  of  any  other  migraine-specific 
symptoms.  In  particular  in  CM  patients,  where  tension  type  headache  and  migraine  headache  often 
overlap, and who complain about highly frequent or almost continuous headache, measurement of HD 
is an important parameter for disease burden. Accordingly, reduction of HD from baseline during the 12-
week DBT was placed highest in hierarchical multiplicity testing [S1] of secondary endpoints. The results 
obtained  for  the  S1  secondary  endpoint  are  similar  to  those  obtained  for  the  primary  MD  reduction 
endpoint. Statistically significant superiority over placebo after multiplicity adjustment was achieved for 
each of the atogepant dosages tested in studies 301 and 303. Numerically more favourable results were 
obtained with increasing doses across the QD (10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg) dose arms in EM study 301. The 
net treatment effect over placebo was more favourable for the 30 mg BID dose arm as compared to the 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 90/136 
 
  
 
 
60 mg QD dose arm in study 303 (LSMD for HD reduction from baseline: 30 mg BID: -2.14, 60 mg QD: 
-1.72). 
At baseline, acute medication (incl. both unspecific analgesics and triptans) was used on a mean of 6-7 
days among EM patients and on about 15 days in the CM population. The change from baseline in mean 
monthly acute medication use days [S2] was second in hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints. For 
both the Acute Medication Use Day and the Triptan Use Day (which was singled out) secondary endpoint 
significant superiority over placebo could be demonstrated for each atogepant dose arm. 
In  terms  of  the  >  50%  reduction  in  3-month  average  of  monthly  MDs  [S3],  statistically  significant 
superiority over placebo was achieved for each atogepant dose arm tested across studies 301 / 303. In 
study 301, more than 50% of subjects allocated to one of the atogepant dose arms achieved a reduction 
by > 50% in the 3-month average of monthly MDs (atogepant: 10 mg QD: 54.6%, 30 mg QD: 58.5%, 
60 mg QD: 59.3%; placebo 29.2%). This underlines the clinical relevance of the improvement achieved 
in terms of the primary MD reduction from baseline across all atogepant dose arms. Among the more 
severely affected CM population of study 303, response rates were slightly lower (30 mg BID: 42.1%, 
60 mg QD: 40.1%). Nonetheless, the probability of achieving a > 50% reduction in the 3-month average 
of monthly MDs was still about twice as high for atogepant as compared to placebo (OR: 30 mg BID: 
2.03, 60 mg QD: 1.90). 
Time course 
The major part of the overall treatment effect is achieved within the first 4-week dosing interval of the 
12-week  DBT  in  both  the  EM  and  CM  population.  Thereafter,  the  reduction  of  mean  monthly  MDs  is 
maintained  or  even  slightly  increases.  The  dose  response  relation  across  the  three  QD  dose  arms  of 
study 301 is consistently observed across the three 28-day intervals of the 12-week DBT. In CM study 
303, the more favourable effect of the 30 mg BID dosing regimen as compared to the 60 mg QD dosing 
scheme gets more pronounced with ongoing treatment duration. 
The course of treatment effect was further analysed per week for the first 28-day period of the DBT of 
studies 301 and 303. In both EM and CM patients, the treatment effect starts within the first week of 
treatment. There was no clear tendency of increasing or decreasing effect of atogepant over the four 1-
week intervals of the first 28-day treatment interval. This is considered to provide valuable information 
to  the  prescriber  when  the  treatment  effect  of  atogepant  is  evaluated  within  the  context  of  clinical 
monitoring. 
Health Outcome Measures 
A  number  of  Health  Outcomes  Measures  were  recorded  throughout  or  at  the  end  of  12-week  DBT  of 
studies  301  and  303,  e.g.  Patient  Global Impression  of  Change  [PGI-C],  Patient  Global Impression  of 
Severity  [PGI-S],  Headache  Impact  Test  Questionnaire  [HIT-6],  Migraine-Specific  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire  [MSQ  v2.1],  Migraine  Disability  Assessment  Questionnaire  [MIDAS],  or  the  Activity 
Impairment in Migraine-Diary [AIM-D]. Overall, results for these patient-reported outcomes measures 
were consistent with the results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for both studies, with 
numerically greater improvements or greater reductions (i.e., improvement) from baseline observed for 
each of the atogepant treatment groups compared with placebo for the majority of measures. 
Subgroups 
Several subgroup analyses were performed to explore the effect of baseline factors in the EM (pooled 
studies  301  and  MD-01)  and  CM  population.  Atogepant  showed  consistently  greater  reductions  from 
baseline in mean monthly migraine days compared with placebo across the demographic subgroups of 
sex,  age  (<  40  years;  ≥  40  to  <  65  years),  race,  and  BMI.  In  the  Forest  Plot  presentation  for  MD 
reduction, atogepant does separate from placebo in the small subgroup of both EM and CM subjects aged 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 91/136 
 
  
 
 
> 65 years. However, the sample sizes were too small per dose group to infer a clinically meaningful 
difference. 
As  concerns  subgroup  per  baseline  MD,  among  EM  subjects,  the  portions  of  patients  with  <  or  ≥  8 
migraine  days  at  baseline  were  about  comparable  (54.2%  resp.  45.8%).  In  both  subgroups,  the 
reduction of mean monthly MDs was significant over placebo across the three atogepant QD dose arms. 
In the most severely affected subgroup of CM patients with > 18 MDs per month at baseline, atogepant 
only numerically separates from placebo for the atogepant 60 Mg QD dose arm (LSMD: -0.60 [-2.17, 
0.97]), while the atogepant 30 mg BID dose arm reaches statistical significance over placebo (LSMD: -
1.79 [-3.38, -0.20]). The more favourable result, obtained in study 303 for the subgroup with the highest 
disease burden (> 18 MDs at baseline) for the atogepant 30 mg BID dose arm as compared to 60 mg 
QD, aligns with the generally more favourable results observed for the twice daily dosing regimen across 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Subgroup  analyses  were  also  conducted  in  EM  and  CM  patients  per  prior  use  of  migraine  preventive 
medication use. Among EM patients, the portions of subjects with (52.4%) or without (47.6%) prior use 
of  prophylactic  treatment were  about  equal.  The  net  difference over  placebo  in  terms  of  monthly  MD 
reduction was more favourable in those EM participants that reported prior use of migraine preventive 
Mx.  The  more  favourable  result  in  subjects  with  prior  prophylaxis  experience  may  be  explained  by 
differences  in  the  placebo  response  between  both  subgroups.  The  placebo  response  was  more 
pronounced in prevention in naïve patients (MD change from baseline: -3.17) as compared to EM subjects 
reporting  prior  preventive  treatment  (MD  change  from  baseline  -2.04).  Results  obtained  in  the  CM 
population  were  comparable  to  the  EM  population  (Study  303:  MD  change  from  baseline,  placebo 
response: prior use yes: -4.78, prior use no: -6.98). Again, the outcome in the 30 mg BID dose arm was 
more favourable as compared to the atogepant 60 mg QD dose arm. 
Subgroup analyses per number of failures to previous migraine preventive treatment attempts revealed 
that  the  effect  of  atogepant  in  terms  of  reduction  of  monthly  MDs  was  maintained  regardless  of  the 
number of previous preventive treatment failures. As evidenced by the net treatment effect over placebo 
per  atogepant  dose  arm,  there  was  no  tendency  for  a  decline  in  atogepant’s  efficacy  with  increasing 
number of previous treatment failures across the EM and CM population. 
The stratification factors unique to Study 303 allowed subgroup analyses by region, acute medication 
overuse, and preventive medication current use. 
While EM Study 301 was conducted at US sites only, CM study 303 comprises different global regions 
(North America 29.5%, Europe 35.2%, East Asia 35.3%). The effect of atogepant was consistent across 
regions. 
In CM Study 303, participants were stratified for acute headache medication overuse (MoH), which was 
prevalent in 63.8% of recruited subjects. On average, acute headache medication was taken on 15-16 
days during the 28-day baseline period. Across the two atogepant dose arms, point estimates reflecting 
the net effect over placebo for monthly reduction of MDs were more favourable in those subjects with 
MoH as compared to those without. The effect of atogepant was consistent regardless of whether subjects 
presented with acute medication overuse or not. 
Concomitant  preventive  migraine  medication  was  permissible  throughout  study  303  and  was  actually 
taken by 10.5% of recruited CM patients. The subgroup analysis per current preventive medication use 
showed efficacy of atogepant to be maintained regardless of whether additional concomitant migraine 
preventive medication was taken or not. Due to the small sample size of participants with concomitant 
prophylactic treatment the CIs for the point estimates for the net effect over placebo in terms of monthly 
MD reduction were considerably wider in this subgroup. 
Persistence of effect 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 92/136 
 
  
 
 
In open-label, long-term study 302, the daily use of 60 mg atogepant QD (N=546) was compared to 
SOC  (N=198)  over  a  52-week  treatment  period  in  EM  patients,  either  recruited  de  novo  (85.6%)  or 
taken  over  from  dose  finding  study  MD-01  (14.4%).  Participants  randomised  to  oral  SOC  migraine 
preventive medication (topiramate: 35.7%, beta-blockers 26.0%, tricyclic antidepressants 25.5%) were 
included to contextualise safety results. 
It was primarily designed to examine safety of long term atogepant use in EM patients. However, efficacy 
was  also  monitored  in  those  subjects  randomised  to  atogepant.  In  atogepant  patients,  a  clinically 
relevant reduction in mean monthly MDs was achieved within the 1st month and was sustained over the 
1-year treatment period. Atogepant treatment led to a reduction in the LS mean number of monthly MDs 
in the first month (Weeks 1-4) of 3.84 days with continued improvement during the remainder of the 
52-week treatment period to a LS mean reduction of -5.19 days in the last month (Weeks 49 to 52). 
It has to be considered that with ongoing treatment duration the portion of likely atogepant responders 
is expected to accumulate. However, study completion is high. About two thirds of subjects allocated to 
atogepant 60 mg QD remains in treatment until week 52 (335/521 [64.3%]). Long term study 302 is 
concluded to provide supportive evidence of long-term efficacy (52 weeks duration) of atogepant 60 mg 
once daily in EM patients. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Dose-finding  study  MD-01  and  pivotal  studies  301  (EM  population)  and  303  (CM  population)  were 
designed concordant with IHS and EMA guidance and provide a sound database demonstrating evidence 
for the benefit of atogepant in preventive migraine treatment across the full spectrum of episodic and 
chronic forms of the disease.  
Atogepant in dosages of 10, 30, and 60 mg QD in EM and 60 mg QD and 30 mg BID in CM demonstrated 
superiority over placebo in reducing the frequency of both migraine days [primary P1], as well as the 
frequency of headache days [secondary S1] and the associated use of medication for the acute treatment 
of migraine [S2]. Higher response rates were seen with each atogepant dosage compared with placebo 
for participants with ≥ 50% reduction in the 3-month average of monthly migraine days [S3]. 
A numerical dose-response relationship was evident for the change from baseline in mean monthly MDs 
across the 12-week DBT in EM Study 301, with greater reductions seen with increasing atogepant dose 
from 10 to 60 mg QD. Only the highest maximum daily dose of 60 mg tested in EM study 301 was taken 
over in CM Study 303. To explore the potential impact of the once daily vs twice daily dosing regimen, 
the 60 mg daily dose was examined across a 60 mg QD and a 30 mg BID treatment arm in CM Study 
303. The placebo-corrected mean reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days observed with 
the atogepant 60 mg QD dose was the same in the EM and CM studies (LSMD of –1.66 in both Study 
301 and 303). 
The robustness of the primary and secondary endpoint results [S1-3] after multiplicity adjustment for 
each  of  the  atogepant  dosages  tested  in  studies  301/303  was  confirmed  across  several  subgroup 
analyses,  like  e.g.  prior  use  of  prevention  medication,  concomitant  use  of  another  prophylactic 
medication (study 303), or prevalent medication overuse (study 303). 
The onset of clinical effect of atogepant is early. In both the EM and CM population, the major part of 
the overall treatment effect in terms of MD reduction is achieved within the first 28-day period of the 
12-week DBT of studies 301 and 303. 
In terms of persistence of effect, supportive efficacy data are obtained from open-label, long-term study 
302 in EM patients for treatment with atogepant 60 mg QD over 52 weeks. A clinically relevant reduction 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 93/136 
 
  
 
 
in mean monthly MDs was achieved within the 1st month and was sustained over the 1-year treatment 
period. 
Overall, there are no objections with regard to efficacy for the proposed use of atogepant in migraine 
prevention. The choice of the dosing interval of the 60 mg daily dose of atogepant was further 
elucidated. The numerically most favourable outcome across primary and secondary endpoints in 
studies MD-01 (EM) and pivotal study 303 (CM) was observed for the 30 mg BID dosing regimen. 
However, the applicant applied for the 60 mg QD once daily as regular dosing scheme only. It is 
established that compliance with migraine preventive treatment remains a challenge. Therefore, the 
potential advantage of a once daily dosing regimen is evident in terms of compliance. On the other 
hand, administration of the most effective treatment is equally expected to positively impact on patient 
compliance. A 30 mg tablet formulation was tested in Study 301, i.e. is available. Nonetheless, the 
proposed posology strategy is to confine to the uniform 60 mg once daily dosing schedule in order to 
provide a simple and convenient posology scheme, which the applicant assumes will best promote 
patient compliance. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety  data  from  the  clinical  studies  included  in  the  application  have  been  organised  into  4  distinct 
analysis sets for the ISS based on study design and populations. 
Placebo-controlled (PCS) analysis set (Group 1a): pooled data from the 3 completed double-blind 
placebo-controlled studies of atogepant administered orally for 12 weeks for the prevention of migraine 
in participants with EM (Studies 301 and MD-01) and participants with CM (Study 303). 
Long-term  safety  (LTS)  analysis  set  (Group  2a):  pooled  data  from  4  atogepant  open-label  LTS 
studies up to 104 weeks duration (completed Studies 302 and 309 in participants with EM, and ongoing 
Studies 306 and 312 in participants with CM). 
Although extension Study 312 enrolled completers from Studies 303 and 304, the latter study is ongoing 
and still blinded. Therefore, data from participants who rolled over from Study 304 are not included in 
the LTS analysis set for this application. At the time of the 10 January 2022 ISS data cut-off date, Study 
312 included a 52-week open-label treatment period (the protocol was subsequently amended to include 
a 104-week open-label treatment period). 
An interim update of LTS data cut-off (11 October 2022) was provided within the course of the procedure 
with focus on hepatic safety. LTS studies 306 and 312 are still ongoing. The comprehensive analysis of 
the LTS safety dataset, as presented within this document (and Module 2.7.4) refers to the initial data 
cut-off (10 January 2022). 
All atogepant analysis set (Group 3a): pooled data from all atogepant-treated participants in Phase 
2/3 and Phase 3 Studies MD-01, 301, 302, 303, 306, 309, 311, and 312. 
Phase  1  analysis  set  (Group  4a):  pooled  data  from  20  Phase  1  clinical  pharmacology  studies  (19 
conducted in healthy participants [including participants with hepatic impairment in Study CGP-PK-01] 
and 1 conducted in participants with migraine [Study 3101-106-002, a drug-drug interaction study with 
ubrogepant]). 
Across  all  studies  in  the  atogepant  clinical  development  programme,  3230  unique  participants  were 
exposed to ≥ 1 dose of atogepant, including 2626 participants in Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies and 604 
participants in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies. The Placebo-controlled Analysis Set (PCS) included

N=2500 subjects in total, N=1837 of these received atogepant and N=663 received placebo. The Long-
term safety Set (LTS) included N=1858 subjects in total, 1662 received atogepant 60 mg QD and N=196 
received SOC. 
Table 40: Number of treated participants by clinical trial group (as of 10 january 2022) 
•  Adverse events 
The  percentages  of  participants  who  had  AEs  were  generally  similar  across  treatment  groups  in  the 
analysis sets. Most individual AE preferred terms were reported at low rates in all treatment groups. The 
majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with few severe AEs in any treatment group. 
Table 41: Overview of adverse events in the placebo-controlled analysis set (safety 
population) 
Placebo-controlled Analysis Set 
The most common AEs in any atogepant group (≥ 5% of participants) were nausea, constipation, fatigue, 
and upper respiratory tract infection.

For the following AEs the majority of cases were considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
drug: 
•  Constipation was reported for 2.0% of participants in the placebo group, compared with 6.1%, 
6.3%, and 7.5% in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively, and 9.0% and 
6.6% in the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups, respectively. 
•  Nausea was reported for 3.3% of participants in the placebo group compared with 5.1%, 5.6%, 
and 9.0% in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively, and 8.2% and 9.9% in 
the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups, respectively; the incidence of nausea increased with 
higher doses of atogepant. 
•  Fatigue was reported for 2.6% of participants in the placebo group compared with 1.3%, 2.4%, 
and 3.2% in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively, and 3.8% and 9.9% in 
the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups. 
Table 42: Number and percentage of participants with common AEs (≥ 2% of participants in 
any treatment group) by preferred term in the placebo-controlled analysis set 
Long-term Safety Set 
AEs were reported for 78.6% of participants in the standard-of-care group and 63.5% of participants in 
the atogepant 60 mg QD group (64.5% in EM Studies 302 and 309 and 60.8% in CM Studies 306 and 
312) in the long-term safety analysis set.  
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with few severe AEs in either treatment group. 
AEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were reported for 36.2% of 
participants in the standard-of-care group and 13.3% of participants in the atogepant 60 mg QD group.  
The most common AEs in the atogepant 60 mg QD group (≥ 5% of participants) were constipation and 
upper respiratory tract infection.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were determined by evaluating TEAEs in the placebo-controlled migraine 
studies (Studies MD-01, 301, and 303) that occurred with a ≥ 2% overall incidence rate in any of the 
atogepant groups and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo. 
All AEs that met either criterion above were evaluated using medical judgment to determine if there was 
a plausible causal relationship between the AE and atogepant, including evaluation of the extent to which 
the  AE  was  consistent  with  the  pharmacology  of  study  drug  and  the  consistency  of  the  pattern  of 
symptoms across multiple studies. 
Constipation, decreased appetite, nausea, and fatigue/somnolence were identified as ADRs. 
Comparison of Adverse Events in EM versus CM Studies 
Placebo-Controlled Studies 
The type and frequency of AEs were similar in the placebo-controlled EM and CM studies.

Table 45: Number of participants with common AEs (≥ 5% of participants in any treatment 
group) by preferred term in placebo-controlled EM studies and CM study 
Long-Term Safety Studies 
Pyrexia was reported at a higher rate in CM (11.1%) than in EM (0.9%) atogepant-treated participants 
in  the  long-term  safety  analysis  set,  which  was  likely  related  to  COVID-19  vaccination  in  Study  306. 
Although  upper  respiratory  infection  was  higher  in  EM  (7.7%)  than  CM  (1.2%)  atogepant-treated 
participants,  it  is  lower  than  in  the  standard-of-care  group  (12.2%);  this  was  likely  related  to  global 
mask-wearing and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during the conduct of 
the CM studies. With the exception of these 2 AEs (pyrexia and upper respiratory infection), the type 
and frequency of AEs were similar in the long-term safety EM and CM studies.

Analysis of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Cardiovascular  events  (cardiac  arrythmias,  central  nervous  system  vascular  disorders,  embolic  and 
thrombotic, hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease), hepatic AEs, suicide-related events, and abuse-
related AEs were identified as AESIs for the placebo-controlled, long-term safety, and Phase 1 analysis 
sets. 
AESI: Cardiovascular Events 
Cardiovascular events were examined for reported preferred terms that could be indicative of a potential 
effect of atogepant on the cardiovascular system because of blockade of calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) receptors (which are expressed widely throughout the vascular system), and which could inhibit 
vasodilation, with potential effects on vascular tone, blood pressure, and global or regional blood flow. 
The following 5 AEs of clinical interest categories were evaluated: cardiac arrhythmias, ischaemic heart 
disease, hypertension, central nervous system vascular disorders, and embolic and thrombotic events. 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
A history of hypertension was reported for 10.4% of participants in the placebo group; 10.5%, 10.5%, 
and 9.6% in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively; and 7.9% and 13.2% in the 
atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups, respectively, in the placebo-controlled analysis set. 
The incidence of hypertension AEs in the atogepant groups was low and similar to that of placebo in the 
placebo-controlled analysis set (0.5% in the placebo group; 0.6%, 1.0%, and 0.6% in the atogepant 10, 
30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively; and 1.7% and 1.1% in the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups, 
respectively). 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 99/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 47: Number and percentage of participants with cardiovascular events in the placebo-
controlled analysis set 
All hypertension AEs were mild or moderate in severity and non-serious and with the exception of the 1 
participant in Study 303 (atogepant 30 BID group) with an AE of blood pressure increased, none were 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  No  dose-dependent  relationship  in  the 
incidence  of  hypertension  events  was  evident.  One  participant  in  the  atogepant  30  mg  BID  group  in 
Study CGP-MD-01 had an AE of hypertension (worsening of) that resulted in discontinuation of study 
drug; the event was moderate and began on Day 54 and was ongoing at last report. 
New antihypertensive medication use and/or increased dose of an existing antihypertensive medication 
occurred infrequently (0.8% in placebo versus 0.6%, 1.0%, and 0.1% in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 
mg QD groups, respectively, and 1.5% and 2.2% in the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups). 
The  incidence  of  other  cardiovascular  events  was  low  in  the  placebo-controlled  analysis  set  and  no 
clinically meaningful differences between the placebo group and the atogepant groups were observed. 
No safety concerns were identified. 
AESI: Hepatic Safety 
The atogepant clinical development programme incorporated monitoring for any signs of hepatic injury 
in  participants.  Hepatic  AEs  (comprised  of  the  hepatic  disorders  SMQ  [broad]  plus  the  PT  of  liver 
transplant) and laboratory data were examined. 
A clinical external adjudication committee (an independent panel of liver experts) was established for 
the blinded surveillance, monitoring, and adjudication of post-baseline elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 
3 × ULN for participants who received either atogepant or placebo; aminotransferase elevations ≥ 3 × 
ULN for participants who received standard-of-care were not adjudicated per the adjudication charter. 
The  adjudication  charter  defined  a  standardised  process  for  the  adjudication  of  data  associated  with 
these events to determine whether the elevation was related to study drug. The relationship of the cases 
to study drug was adjudicated using a 3-category scale (probable, possible, or unlikely) based on the 
criteria specified in the hepatic adjudication committee charter. 
Post-baseline ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 × ULN were prospectively defined in the Phase 2/3 study and 
Phase 3 studies as AESIs and were systematically investigated in accordance with the drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) guidance (FDA 2009).

Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set (PCS) 
Hepatic Injury Adverse Events (PCS) 
The percentages of participants in the placebo-controlled analysis set who had hepatic injury AEs were 
1.8%  in  the  placebo  group  versus  1.5%  across  atogepant  groups.  The  most  common  AEs  were  ALT 
increased and AST increased. 
None of these AEs was serious, and the majority were mild or moderate in severity. Two participants 
discontinued study drug because of these AEs. 
Table 48: Number and percentage of participants with hepatic disorder or liver transplant 
adverse events in the placebo-controlled analysis set 
Hepatic Laboratory Values of Special Interest (PCS) 
Post-baseline elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN were generally similar across atogepant groups 
and similar to placebo. No participant had concurrent ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
≥ 1.5 × ULN. 
One participant (atogepant 60 mg QD group), with a family history of Gilbert's syndrome, had a post-
baseline isolated total bilirubin elevation ≥ 2 × ULN.

Table 49: Number and percentage of participants in the placebo-controlled analysis set with 
post-baseline hepatic laboratory values of special interest 
Twenty-four participants in the placebo-controlled analysis set had ALT and/or AST elevations ≥ 3 × ULN 
that  were  adjudicated  by  the  clinical  adjudication  committee;  17  of  these  cases  were  in  atogepant 
groups. Of these 17 cases in atogepant-treated participants, 2 cases (1 in the atogepant 30 mg QD group 
and 1 in the atogepant 60 mg QD group) were adjudicated as probably related to study drug and 2 cases 
(1  in  the  atogepant  10  mg  QD  group  and  1  in  the  atogepant  30  mg  QD  group)  were  adjudicated  as 
possibly related. The remaining 13 atogepant cases were adjudicated as unlikely related to study drug. 
All 4 atogepant-treated cases that were adjudicated as probably or possibly related to study drug were 
asymptomatic, non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, without concurrent bilirubin elevations, and 
resolved with or without atogepant discontinuation; all but one of these cases had potential confounding 
factors.

Long-Term Safety Analysis Set (LTS) 
Hepatic Injury Adverse Events (LTS) 
The number and percentages of participants in the standard-of-care and atogepant 60 mg QD groups 
who had hepatic injury AEs in the long-term safety analysis were similar (3.1% and 2.5%, respectively). 
The most common AEs were AST increased and ALT increased. The AE of hepatitis E antibody positive 
was  reported  for  6  participants  (0.4%)  in  the  atogepant  60  mg  QD  group;  per  the  protocols  all 
participants from the lead-in studies were to repeat hepatitis E serology tests at the time of enrolment 
in the long-term extension studies and participants with a positive result were to be discontinued from 
study drug. 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity and non-serious. Fifteen participants had AEs that 
led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Table 51: Number and percentage of participants with hepatic disorder or liver transplant 
adverse events in the long-term safety analysis set 
Hepatic Laboratory Values of Special Interest (LTS) 
Post-baseline elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN were higher in the standard-of-care group (3.2%) 
than in the atogepant 60 mg group (1.5%). 
One participant (atogepant 60 mg QD group) had concurrent ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin  ≥  1.5  ×  ULN,  in  the  context  of  symptomatic  cholelithiasis.  This  case  was  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  not  related  to  study  drug  and  adjudicated  as  unlikely  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
external adjudication committee. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 103/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One participant (atogepant 60 mg QD group), with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, had isolated post-
baseline total bilirubin elevations ≥ 2 × ULN. 
Table 52: Number and percentage of participants in the long-term safety analysis set with 
post-baseline hepatic laboratory values of special interest 
Twenty-four participants (all in the atogepant 60 mg QD group) in the long-term safety analysis set had 
ALT  and/or  AST  elevations  ≥  3  ×  ULN.  Twenty-two  of  these  cases  were  adjudicated  by  the  external 
clinical adjudication committee prior to the 10 January 2022 clinical cutoff date. The remaining 2 cases 
were adjudicated in April 2022. Three cases were adjudicated as probably related to study drug and 5 
cases  were  adjudicated  as  possibly  related;  the  remaining  16  atogepant  cases  were  adjudicated  as 
unlikely  related  to  study  drug.  Aminotransferase  elevations  in  the  standard-of-care  group  were  not 
adjudicated per the adjudication charter. 
Among the 8 cases that were adjudicated as probably or possibly related to study drug all were non-
serious, mild to moderate in severity, without concurrent bilirubin elevation, and resolved with or without 
atogepant discontinuation.

to study drug 
AESI: Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behaviour 
The  potential  risk  of  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  behaviour  was  examined  because  brain-penetrant 
drugs can cause behavioural or psychiatric side-effects. Atogepant was not associated with an increased 
risk of suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour compared with placebo in the placebo-controlled analysis 
set or with the  standard-of-care group in the long-term safety analysis set. 
Suicidal ideation was reported via C-SSRS assessment for < 1% of participants in any of the atogepant 
groups during the treatment period in either the placebo-controlled analysis set or the long-term safety 
analysis  set.  The  percentage  of  participants  with  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  in  the  atogepant 
treatment groups was similar or lower than that of the placebo or standard-of-care groups. 
AESI: Abuse 
There is no evidence in the literature that CGRP signalling is linked to drug reinforcement or physical 
dependence and/or withdrawal. Atogepant, a potent CGRP receptor antagonist (Ki = 15-26 pM), did not 
exhibit significant affinity for a variety of central nervous system targets known to be associated with 
drugs of abuse, e.g., dopamine, cannabinoid, acetylcholine and opioid receptors, gamma-aminobutyric 
acid  (GABA)  or  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor  complex,  and  transporters  for  dopamine, 
serotonin, and norepinephrine. 
AE PTs potentially predictive of abuse potential were identified based on the FDA Guidance for Industry: 
Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs (2017). The totality of the data support a lack of abuse potential 
risk  with  atogepant  based  on  its  pharmacological  class  and  properties  and  its  lack  of  abuse  signal  in 
nonclinical and clinical studies. 
•  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Placebo-controlled Analysis Set 
The percentages of participants with SAEs in the atogepant groups in the placebo-controlled analysis set 
were low and similar to that of placebo with no more than 1.3% of participants in any of the atogepant 
groups having had SAEs compared with 1.1% of participants in the placebo group. A total of 3.6% of 
participants in the standard-of-care group and 3.4% of participants in the atogepant 60 mg QD group 
had SAEs in the long-term safety analysis set. The majority of preferred terms for SAEs were not reported 
for  more  than  1  participant.  With  the  exception  of  an  SAE  of  optic  neuritis  in  the  placebo-controlled 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 105/136 
 
  
 
 
 
 
analysis set (atogepant 10 mg QD), none of the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be related 
to study drug. The event of optic neuritis was considered by the sponsor to be not related to study drug 
as the characteristics of the event were not consistent with the diagnosis of optic neuritis. 
Long-term Safety Analysis Set 
SAEs were reported for 3.6% of participants in the standard-of-care group and 3.4% of participants in 
the  atogepant  60  mg  group  in  the  long-term  safety  analysis  set  (2.7.4,  Table  22).  The  majority  of 
preferred terms were not reported for more than 1 participant. None of the SAEs was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. 
Death 
No fatal AEs were reported in the placebo-controlled analysis set or in the Phase 1 analysis set; 3 fatal 
AEs, all in the atogepant 60 mg QD group in the long-term safety analysis set were reported. The causes 
of death were beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection (toxic shock syndrome), homicide, and asphyxia 
(by  house  fire).  None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug. 
Narratives for deaths are provided. 
•  Laboratory findings 
Analysis of laboratory parameters does not suggest any safety concerns. Mean changes from baseline to 
post-baseline visits were similar across treatment groups in both the placebo-controlled analysis set and 
the long-term safety analysis set. 
Blood Pressure Over Time 
Mean and median changes from baseline to predefined visits and to the end of study for blood pressure 
parameters  in  the  placebo-controlled  analysis  set  were  typically  small  and  similar  across  treatment 
groups.

Weight 
A total of 14.1% of participants in the placebo-controlled analysis set had a history of obesity at baseline: 
13.9% in the placebo group and 14.2% in the atogepant groups (8.7% to 20.1% across the atogepant 
groups). Mean weight at baseline for all participants was 79.3 kg, and mean BMI was 28.86 kg/m2, with 
25% of participants weighing between 92.0 and 226 kg and 25% of participants with a BMI between 
33.18 and 82.0 kg/m2. 
The change from baseline to end of treatment in mean weight was +0.23 kg in the placebo group versus 
+0.07, –0.40, and –0.90 kg in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively, and –0.86 in 
both the atogepant 30 and 60 mg BID groups; weight appeared to decrease in a dose-dependent manner 
across atogepant groups. Decreases in mean weight in the atogepant groups were apparent at Week 2, 
the first post-dose measurement, and continued to decrease over the 12-week treatment period. 
Increases and decreases in weight that met potentially clinically significant (PCS) criteria (≥ 7% change 
from baseline) were observed in both the placebo and atogepant groups. The percentage of participants 
with PCS weight decrease was greater in the atogepant groups (4.6%) than in the placebo group (2.5%) 
and appeared to be dose-dependent. The percentage of participants with PCS weight gain was lower in 
the atogepant groups (1.6%) than in the placebo group (2.3%).

Figure 16: Potentially clinically significant decreases or increases in weight in the placebo-
controlled analysis set 
In the Long-Term Safety Analysis Set, the change from baseline to end of treatment in mean weight was 
+0.20 kg in the standard-of-care group and –1.60 kg in the atogepant 60 mg QD group. A decrease in 
mean  weight  in  the  atogepant  60  mg  QD  group  was  apparent  at  Week  4,  the  first  post-dose 
measurement, and remained generally stable after approximately Week 20. 
Increases and decreases in weight that met PCS criteria (≥ 7% change from baseline) were observed in 
both  the  standard-of-care  and  atogepant  60  mg  QD  groups.  The  percentage  of  participants  with  PCS 
weight decrease was 23.4% than in the atogepant 60 mg QD group and 14.7% in the standard-of-care 
group. The percentage of participants with PCS weight gain was 7.4% in the atogepant 60 mg QD group 
and 12.6% in the standard-of-care group.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions studies were conducted for concomitant administration of atogepant with ubrogepant, 
topiramate,  sumatriptan,  naproxen  /  acetaminophen,  oral  contraceptives,  esomeprazole,  quinidine, 
rifampin, and itraconazole. 
Changes in atogepant exposure were observed after co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, OATP 
inhibitors,  and  strong  CYP3A4  inducers.  Appropriate  guidance  for  prescribers  and  participants  was 
proposed in the labelling with respect to drug-drug interactions. 
To examine the potential effects of drug interactions, AE data were examined in the subset of participants 
who took common classes of concomitant medications (i.e., World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
ATC4 medication classes used by ≥ 10% of participants in any treatment group during the treatment 
period) in the placebo-controlled studies and in the long-term safety studies. Review of AE data showed 
no appreciable differences in the type of AEs reported in the subsets of participants who took common 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

classes  of  concomitant  medications  for  the  placebo-controlled  and  long-term  safety  analysis  sets, 
respectively. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were reported for 3.2% of participants in the placebo group; 
4.1%, 3.4%, and 3.1% of participants in the atogepant 10, 30, and 60 mg QD groups, respectively; and 
5.2% and 6.6% of participants in the 30 and 60 mg BID groups, respectively, in the placebo-controlled 
analysis  set.  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  in  more  than  1  participant  in  any  treatment  group  are 
presented in the table below.

A  summary  of  post-marketing  reports  from  28  September  2021  to  27  March  2022  showed  no  safety 
signals. 
One spontaneous post-marketing report of acute liver failure with atogepant 60 mg QD that led to liver 
transplantation was retrieved from the search through 27 March 2022 (described in detail Mod. 2.7.4). 
AbbVie has performed additional follow-up with due diligence to acquire further information on the case 
(included in the CIOMS report). The expert opinion was sought to provide causality assessment for the 
acute liver failure event. 
Introduction 
On 07 March 2022, AbbVie received follow-up information on a serious spontaneous report of acute liver 
failure with atogepant that was initially reported as non-serious acute hepatitis.

AbbVie reviewed this case and sought the expert opinion. It was concluded there was insufficient data 
to assign causality. Additional follow-up with due diligence was performed to acquire further information 
on the case. 
Case Narrative 
A female patient experienced acute liver failure on Day 127 after atogepant initiation, that led to liver 
transplantation. Atogepant 60 mg QD was started for "headache". 
The patient's medical history included attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, 
anxiety, migraine, constipation, and social occasional drinker. No history of obesity (unknown BMI), liver 
diseases, or alcohol abuse was noted.  
The  patient's  concomitant  medications  and  herbal  dietary  supplements  included  paroxetine  for 
depression,  clonazepam  as  needed  for  anxiety,  amphetamine  and  dextroamphetamine  for  ADHD, 
trazodone as needed for anxiety, and linaclotide for constipation. No start date was reported for any of 
these  medications;  however,  all  were  discontinued  on  Day  127.  Botulinum  toxin  type  A  for  migraine 
prevention was injected on an unknown day approximately 2 months after atogepant initiation. 
On Day 76 after atogepant initiation, the patient underwent an outpatient surgical procedure. Cefazoline 
2  grams  was  administered  pre-operatively.  Fentanyl,  rocuronium,  succinylcholine,  and  unspecified 
steroids  (8  mg)  were  administered  intra-operatively.  It  is  unknown  whether  any  inhaled  anaesthetics 
were used or if the patient received inhaled anaesthetics in prior surgeries. A 7-day course of cephalexin 
was  prescribed  post-operatively.  Acetaminophen  and  oxycodone  were  also  prescribed  as  needed;  no 
details on their use after surgery were reported. 
Approximately 1 week before the surgery, on Day 68, mild elevations on ALT (86 U/L [ULN not stated]) 
were noticed with a decreasing trend (ALT 71 U/L on Day 71). 
The patient received linaclotide and polyethylene glycol 3350 on unknown days due to aggravation of 
constipation. On Day 93, the patient received a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg orally due to vaginal 
yeast infection. 
After the surgery, up to Day 127, the patient was observed 6 times by the surgeon, but no details on 
the clinic visits were provided. No laboratory tests were performed during this period. On Day 127, the 
surgeon  noticed  that  the  patient  had  jaundice  and  referred  the  patient  to  an  internal  medicine 
consultation. Fatigue was also reported on that day and laboratory tests revealed ALT of 1943 IU/L, AST 
> 2000 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 174 IU/L, total bilirubin of 12 mg/dL (direct bilirubin 
not  tested),  albumin  of  4.4  g/dL,  creatinine  of  1.1  mg/dL  (baseline  around  0.7  mg/dL),  international 
normalised ratio (INR) of 1.8, prothrombin time (PT) of 19 seconds, and platelet count of 130,000/mm3 
(was 220,000/mm3 on Day 71). 
The patient discontinued all concomitant medications on Day 127 and went back to the clinic for retesting 
and  supplementary  testing  on  Day  131.  Results  showed  ALT  of  1798  IU/L,  AST  of  1163  IU/L,  total 
bilirubin  of  23.9  mg/dL,  PT  of  21.7  and  25.4  later,  INR  of  2.1,  albumin  of  3.6  g/dL,  and  alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) of 255 IU/L. Hepatitis A (HAV IgM), B (HBsAg, anti-HBc), and C (HCV RNA), HIV 1 
and 2, and COVID serologies were negative. Reportedly, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) serologies and autoimmune markers were negative. Acetaminophen levels were negative.  
An abdominal ultrasound was performed on that day and revealed mild fatty liver and ascites. The patient 
was hospitalised on the same day in a liver transplant centre. During hospitalisation, a liver biopsy was 
performed  on  an  unknown  day  and  showed  "80%  liver  necrosis  and  no  evidence  of  autoimmune 
hepatitis." The patient developed hepatic encephalopathy and multi-organ failure during hospitalisation 
and a liver transplantation was performed on Day 141.

No further details on the hospitalisation, tests, treatments, or liver explant results were provided. The 
patient was discharged on Day 155. Liver test results during the events and evaluation testing results 
are presented in the table below.

Independent DILI Expert Causality Assessment  
"There  is  insufficient  data  to  assign  causality  in  this  case.  The  event  is  compatible  with  DILI  and  the 
timing is consistent with a role for Atogepant. However, there was a balance in the incidence of liver 
chemistry elevations between Atogepant and placebo in the Atogepant clinical trials which is not expected 
for a drug that can cause liver failure (that is, Atogepant does not fulfill "Temple's Corollary"). In addition, 
this case is confounded by the surgical procedure this patient underwent that included treatment with 
potentially hepatotoxic drugs and all relevant data is not available. All efforts should be made to obtain 
the operative report (to check for inhaled anesthetic administration), the liver biopsy report, serial liver 
chemistries while hospitalized, and documentation of the full evaluation for alternate. Potential causes 
should also be sought for the mild elevation in serum ALT observed prior to surgery, including use of 
over-the-counter medications and herbal/dietary supplements."

2.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety database pools 
The overall safety dataset was grouped into 4 distinct Analysis Sets. Of these, the Placebo-controlled 
Analysis Set (PCS, dose-finding study MD-01, EM study 301, CM study 303 [12-week DBT plus 4-week 
FU]; N=2500, n=1837 atogepant, n=663 placebo) and the Long-term Safety Analysis Set (LTS, N=1861, 
n=1665 atogepant, n=196 SOC) are of primary interest. The Long-term Safety Set comprises open label 
safety data obtained from EM patients (studies 302 and 309) and from CM patients (studies 306 and 
312). Safety data from ongoing CM studies 306 and 312 were included as per ISS cutoff date 10 January 
2022. Interim Summaries of Efficacy and Safety (Agency Response – EU – Oct 2022) were provided for 
studies 306 and 312. Study 306 is an open-label, long-term safety extension, conducted in Japanese 
adults who either completed Study 303 or who were recruited de novo. Per ISS cutoff date, N=155 CM 
patients  were  included  from  study  306  in  the  Long-term  Safety  Set.  In  open-label,  long-term  safety 
extension study 312, CM patients were included who completed either Study 303 or Study 304. 
Overall exposure to atogepant is sufficiently large. A total of N=3230 unique participants (including 604 
healthy volunteers, 656 participants with CM, and 1970 EM patients) were exposed to at least 1 dose of 
atogepant  during  clinical  development.  With  regard  to  the  duration  of  exposure,  the  minimum 
requirements as specified per ICH E1 Guidance are fulfilled. 
Demographics 
In severely affected migraine patients of the PCS set, comorbidity with conditions like anxiety (16.7%), 
depression  (15.9%),  or  insomnia  (13.0%)  is  considered  representative  for  the  target  population  in 
clinical practice. Notably, a portion of 14.1% of patients presented with obesity. The mean BMI in the 
PCS set (N=2500) was 28.86 kg/m2. 
Clinically significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease were excluded, like e.g. ischaemic heart 
disease  (e.g.  unstable  angina  pectoris),  cardiac  rhythm  or  conduction  abnormalities  (e.g.  atrial 
fibrillation,  second-  or  third-degree  heart  block),  myocardial  infarction,  transient  ischaemic  attack,  or 
stroke within 6 months prior to Visit 1, Hypertension [systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg or sitting 
diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg]. Subjects with less significant cardiac or vascular conditions were 
not  excluded.  About  5%  of  included  subjects  presented  with  cardiac  disorders  at  baseline  in  studies 
301/303. Further 8-10% of subjects presented with less severe forms of hypertension. More than 70% 
of  PCS  subjects  took  concomitant  cardiovascular  medication.  The  rates  of  newly  initiated  or  CV 
medication dose increases were about equal between placebo (7.2%) and atogepant patients (8.0%). 
Most common adverse events 
Atogepant preventive migraine treatment was well tolerated. The overall rate of subjects discontinuing 
due to AE was about equal in the PCS set between participants receiving atogepant 60 mg QD (3.1%) 
and  placebo  subjects  (3.2%).  In  the  Long-term  Safety  set,  however,  more  patients  discontinued  for 
tolerability reasons in the atogepant arm (4.5%) as compared to SOC (2.6%). 
The most common AEs in any atogepant group (≥ 5% of participants) were nausea, constipation, fatigue, 
and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  Of  these,  constipation,  nausea,  and  fatigue  were  considered  as 
related to study drug in the majority of cases. In particular, for nausea (atogepant: 7.5%, placebo 3.3%) 
and constipation (atogepant: 7.2%, placebo: 2.0%) reporting rates in atogepant patients were higher 
as compared to placebo. Constipation is also labelled as common adverse reaction to biological CGRP 
antagonists erenumab and galzanezumab. Of note, the AE of decreased appetite was reported about ten 
times more often in atogepant patients (2.1%) as compared to placebo (0.2%). There was no clear dose 
response relation for the rate of TEAEs across the atogepant doses, ranging from atogepant 10 mg QD 
to supra-therapeutic atogepant 60 mg BID in the PCS set. 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 112/136 
 
  
 
 
In  long-term  safety  study  302,  a  SOC  arm  was  included  to  contextualise  safety.  The  rate  of  patients 
showing  TEAEs  was  lower  for  atogepant  60  mg  QD  (N=1662,  63.5%)  as  compared  to  SOC  (N=196, 
78.6%). However, interpretation is cautioned given the disparity of underlying datasets. 
The number and percentage of participants with common AE in the LTS set reveals good tolerability of 
long-term  atogepant  60  mg  QD  use  as  compared  to  the  standard  of  care  control  arm.  Of  those  AEs 
observed in the PCS set which were considered related to study drug, only constipation was reported 
more often for atogepant 60 mg QD (6.0%) as compared to SOC (3.1%). The remaining two “related” 
AEs were observed more often in the SOC arm (nausea: atogepant 60 mg QD: 4.3%, SOC 6.1%; fatigue: 
atogepant 60 mg QD: 1.7%, SOC: 6.1%). 
There was no indication atogepant would be liable to induce CNS-related AEs. Typical CNS-related AEs 
like  dizziness  (atogepant:  2.2%,  SOC:  11.2%),  anxiety  (atogepant:  2.0%,  SOC:  5.6%),  somnolence 
(atogepant: 0.8%, SOC: 4.1%), or sedation (atogepant: 0.0%, SOC: 2.0%) were observed more often 
in patients receiving SOC preventive migraine treatment as compared to atogepant. 
In line with reported AE of appetite decreased in the PCS set, after long term treatment with atogepant 
60 mg QD more patients were seen with weight decreased (n=37, 2.2%) as compared to SOC (n=3, 
1.5%). The inverse effect, i.e. weight increased, were observed more often across SOC patients (5.6%) 
as  compared  to  atogepant  (0.9%).  Among  commonly  used  standard  of  care  migraine  prevention 
therapeutics,  there  are  agents  for  which  a  potential  influence  on  body  weight  is  established  (e.g. 
topiramate, ß-blockers). 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were determined by evaluating TEAEs in the placebo-controlled migraine 
studies (Studies MD-01, 301, and 303) that occurred with a ≥ 2% overall incidence rate in any of the 
atogepant  groups  and  at  a  rate  at  least  2%  greater  than  placebo.  Constipation,  decreased  appetite, 
nausea, and fatigue/somnolence were identified as ADRs. 
The  overall  incidence  of  SAE  in  the  PSC  set  was  low  across  atogepant  treatment  arms  (<  1.3%)  and 
similar to placebo (1.1%). None of the observed SAE was reported in more than 1 participant. 
There was one SAE of presumed optic neuritis, which was considered as related to study drug by the 
Investigator,  but  was  considered  not  related  by  the  Sponsor.  Irrespective  of  any  attempt  to 
retrospectively  decide  upon  potential  relatedness  of  the  single  SAE  of  presumed  optic  neuritis,  it  is 
suggested to examine future PSUR reports for potential signals in this regard. 
In  the  LTS  set,  the  overall  rate  of  TESAE  was  higher  in  patients  receiving  SOC  (N=196,  3.6%)  as 
compared  to  patients  receiving  atogepant  60  mg  QD  (N=1662,  3.4%).  Importantly,  there  is  no 
accumulation of any SAE. For the vast majority of SAE per preferred term the frequency in atogepant 
subjects is 0.1%. This includes Hepatobiliary disorders (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis) and Investigations 
(ALT  increased,  AST  increased).  There  wasn’t  any  cardiovascular  SAE  under  long-term  atogepant 
treatment. 
AEs of special interest 
Cardiovascular  events  (cardiac  arrythmias,  central  nervous  system  vascular  disorders,  embolic  and 
thrombotic, hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease), hepatic AEs, suicide-related events, and abuse-
related AEs were identified as AESIs for the placebo-controlled, long-term safety, and Phase 1 analysis 
sets. 
Cardiovascular Events 
A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular safety of atogepant as TEAESI was provided for both the 
use  of  atogepant  under  placebo-controlled  conditions  and  long-term  over  52-weeks.  There  was  no 
incident of ischaemic heart disease. The incidence of arrhythmia-related AEs was low and similar between 
atogepant (0.3%) and placebo (0.2%). Across the PCS and LTS set, only two cases of hypertension as 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 113/136 
 
  
 
 
reported AE were considered by the Investigator as related to study medication. Based on the narratives, 
however,  there  is  no  clear  suspect  of  atogepant  having  a  causative  role  given  the  overall  medical 
conditions of concerned subjects and timing of reporting (resp. persistence of the event) in relation to 
atogepant treatment. 
Hepatic Safety 
Historical  clinical  development  programs  for  other  members  of  the  gepant  family  (telcagepant)  were 
halted  when  liver  toxicity  was  detected  during  migraine  prophylaxis  trials  (Ho  TW.  Neurology  2014). 
Therefore,  AEs  related  to  hepatic  toxicity  were  systematically  evaluated  as  AEs  of  special  interest, 
including blinded adjudication of post-baseline elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN for participants 
who received either atogepant or placebo by an external expert committee. In the Placebo-controlled 
Analysis  Set,  hepatic  injury  TEAE  overall  (atogepant:  1.5%,  placebo:  1.8%),  and  hepatic  enzyme 
elevations (ALT increased: atogepant: 1.1%, placebo: 1.5%; AST increased: atogepant: 1.0%, placebo: 
1.4%)  were  observed  more  often  in  placebo  patients  than  in  participants  receiving  atogepant.  The 
incidence of ALT or AST increase was independent of the atogepant dose. 
A  categorised  overview  was  provided  of  participants  in  the  PCS  set  with  liver  enzyme  elevations  per 
degree of enzyme elevation (> 2 x ULN, > 3 x ULN, > 5 x ULN, > 10 x ULN, > 20 x ULN). In the PCS 
set, no subject was observed with elevations of > 20 x ULN. In one patient receiving atogepant 10 mg 
QD,  ALT  and  /  or  AST  were  elevated  by  >  10  x  ULN  during  safety  FU.  The  respective  subject  never 
stopped atogepant and completed study 301. Liver enzymes were elevated on Day 1 prior to the first 
dose  of  atogepant  (ALT:  3.3  x  ULN;  AST:  4.3  x  ULN).  The  blinded  adjudication  experts  rated  the 
relationship to treatment as unlikely. However, there is concern about the potential role of continued 
atogepant treatment over 12 weeks in raising liver enzymes from 3.3-4.3 x ULN at study entry to > 10 
x ULN during follow-up. 
A  total  of  n=24  cases  with  aminotransferase  elevations  >  3  x  ULN  were  adjudicated  by  the  external 
blinded Expert Committee in the PCS set. Of these, n=17 subjects received atogepant (n=7 received 
placebo).  Among  the  atogepant  patients,  n=4  subjects  (out  of  N=1837)  were  adjudicated  as  either 
possible  (n=2)  or  probably  related  (n=2)  to  atogepant  treatment.  Narratives  were  provided.  In  3  of 
these  cases,  there  were  confounding  factors  like  intensive  weightlifting  in  the  gym,  extensive 
concomitant  acetaminophen  use  for  acute  headache,  or  Class  III  obesity  (BMI  39.6  kg/m2).  All  4 
atogepant-treated  cases  that  were  adjudicated  as  probably  or  possibly  related  to  study  drug  were 
asymptomatic, non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, without concurrent bilirubin elevations, and 
resolved with or without atogepant discontinuation. 
There was one single case of temporary TBL elevation of 2.08 x ULN. It concerns a 29-year old male 
participant  of  study  301  receiving  atogepant  60  mg  QD.  It  was  reported  that  his  father  had  Gilbert 
Syndrome. Prior to receiving the first dose of atogepant on Day 1, total bilirubin was 2.1 mg/dL (1.75 x 
ULN).  Aminotransferases  were  not  relevantly  elevated  at  any  stage.  Fluctuating  bilirubin  values  were 
recorded  throughout  12-week  study  301  and  roll-over  to  open-label  extension  study  309.  Bilirubin 
elevations are considered not related to atogepant treatment.  
Under  long  term  treatment  (LTS  set),  the  incidence  of  hepatic  injury  overall  (atogepant  2.5%,  SOC 
3.1%),  and  aminotransferase  elevations  as  TEAE  (AST  increased:  atogepant  1.7%,  SOC  2.6%;  ALT 
increased:  atogepant  1.6%,  SOC:  2.0%)  was  higher  in  participants  receiving  standard-of-care  as 
compared to atogepant. 
Analysis of enzyme elevation categories in the long-term analysis set reveals that any aminotransferase 
elevation (AST or ALT > 1 x ULN) was observed more frequently across SOC patients under long term 
treatment (28.9%) as compared to atogepant 60 mg QD patients (14.4%). Single cases of very high 
aminotransferase  increases,  however,  were  not  reported  in  SOC  patients  but  only  in  participants 
receiving atogepant (ALT or AST > 10 x ULN: n=4 [0.2%], ALT or AST > 20 x ULN: n=1 [0.1%]). 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 114/136 
 
  
 
 
Patients with hepatic enzyme elevations > 3 x ULN under long-term atogepant treatment (n=24/1662) 
were  also  adjudicated  by  the  external  blinded  expert  committee.  In  eight  cases,  the  relationship  of 
aminotransferase elevations to study drug was rated as possible or probable. Narratives were provided. 
In subjects recruited for long-term studies 302 and 309, confounding factors like weightlifting, obesity, 
history of binge drinking, or transient periods of increased alcohol consumption are reported and subjects 
completed the  study.  The  remaining  cases  are  reported  for  long-term  study  306  conducted  in  Japan. 
Atogepant  treatment  was  discontinued  in  n=4  subjects  from  study  306,  for  which  the  relationship  to 
study  drug  was  rated  possible  or  probable.  In  these  cases,  confounding  factors  (e.g.  concomitant 
betahistine, cephalosporin, azithromycin) are less clear. There was an increase in any aminotransferase 
elevations for long-term use of atogepant (LTS: ALT or AST > 1 x ULN: 236/1644 [14.4%]) as compared 
to the 12-week treatment period of the placebo-controlled analysis set (PCS: ALT or AST > 1.0 x ULN: 
198/1810  [10.9%]).  However,  the  frequency  of  any  aminotransferase  increase  under  long-term 
atogepant use (14.4%) was lower as compared to participants receiving long-term SOC (28.9%). 
Of note, among the 8 cases that were adjudicated as probably or possibly related to study drug all were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, without concurrent bilirubin elevation, and resolved with or 
without atogepant discontinuation. 
In the clinical trial dataset (placebo-controlled and long-term), there was no case fulfilling criteria for 
potential Hy’s Law (ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and TBL > 2 x ULN and ALP < 2 x ULN). 
Hence,  the  overall  hepatic  safety  profile  of  atogepant,  as  obtained  from  clinical  trials,  appears  rather 
favourable. Furthermore, a comprehensive re-evaluation of atogepant’s hepatic safety was provided after 
receipt of one spontaneous post-marketing report of acute liver failure with atogepant 60 mg QD that 
led to liver transplantation. 
The post-marketing case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was observed in a female who developed 
acute  liver  failure  leading  to  liver  transplant  on  Day  127  of  atogepant  60  mg  treatment  for  migraine 
prophylaxis.  An  independent  Expert  confirmed  the  event  to  be  compatible  with  DILI  and  timing  as 
consistent  with  a  role  for  atogepant.  However,  the  Expert  outlines  that  there  was  a  balance  in  the 
incidence of liver chemistry elevations between atogepant and placebo, which is not expected for a drug 
that can cause liver failure.  
A thorough and comprehensive overall evaluation of atogepant’s hepatic safety profile was submitted 
incl. updates of ongoing long-term safety studies 306 /312 and growing post-marketing experience. 
The fact that the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations was not increased in atogepant patients 
as compared to patients receiving placebo in the PCS dataset, or to subjects receiving SOC in LT study 
302 is providing reassurance. In line with results obtained from the DILIsym model (including in vitro 
tests of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis) atogepant 
is not considered to intrinsically induce hepatotoxicity. 
A potential idiosyncratic liability, however, may only manifest with temporal latency, and due to its 
rarity, in larger populations. Across the placebo-controlled (PCS), long-term (LTS) and post-marketing 
datasets, clinically relevant enzyme elevations were observed in patients receiving atogepant (although 
mostly asymptomatic across clinical trials). In some of these cases, AST/ALT elevations were 
adjudicated as possibly or probably related to atogepant treatment based on positive dechallenge and / 
or absence of clear confounders.  
The applicant’s proposal is endorsed to address the issue in SmPC section 4.8. Also, the applicant’s 
proposal to extend active surveillance by another year within the scope of ongoing long-term safety 
study 312 (to a total duration of 3 years) is endorsed.

Suicidal ideation 
Atogepant was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour compared 
with placebo in the placebo-controlled analysis set or compared with the standard-of-care group in the 
long-term safety analysis set. 
Abuse liability 
Potential  abuse  liability  of  atogepant  was  systematically  evaluated  by  screening  for  PTs  potentially 
predictive of abuse potential. It is to be noted that symptoms like dizziness, somnolence, or disturbance 
in attention may also well occur in the context of migraine attacks, and do not necessarily have to be 
associated to treatment. Over long-term treatment, all these AEs (dizziness, somnolence, disturbance in 
attention) were reported more often in SOC patients as compared to participants receiving atogepant 60 
mg QD. It is reminded that single standard-of-care migraine preventive agents like e.g. amitriptyline or 
topiramate may account for respective AEs. No events of euphoria were reported. Overall, examination 
of  abuse-related  AEs  across  all  the  ISS  analysis  sets  showed  no  evidence  of  abuse  potential  with 
atogepant. 
Vital signs: Blood pressure 
Throughout the 12-week DBT period, blood pressure was measured at baseline, scheduled Visits at Week 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10,  EoT, and Follow-up. Both for placebo and atogepant dose arms, mean systolic BP and 
diastolic BP remain virtually unaffected. Incidences of BP changes of clinical interest (e.g. systolic BP > 
180 mmHG or increases by > 20 mmHg, or any > 10 mmHg increase from baseline in systolic or diastolic 
BP) were rare and equally distributed across atogepant dose arms and placebo. It is noted that during 
study Visits BP was measured independent of the time of study medication intake. However, based on 
phase  I  population  data  summarizing  vital  sign  (BP,  heart  rate)  measurements  taken  per  dose  (incl. 
supra-therapeutic  doses  up  to  atogepant  300  mg  QD)  in  close  timely  relation  to  study  medication 
administration, it could be shown that no clear dose-related effect on BP / heart rate was observed for 
atogepant in healthy volunteers. This finding goes along with the favourable cardiovascular safety profile, 
which was monitored throughout the phase II/III trial programme as AE of special interest. 
Body weight 
Decreases  in  body  weight  by  >  7%  from  baseline  were  observed  in  atogepant  patients  both  under 
placebo-controlled  conditions  and  under  long-term  open-label  conditions.  In  both  scenarios,  the 
incidence was higher in participants receiving atogepant as compared to the comparator (Body weight 
decrease by > 7% from baseline: Placebo-controlled Set: atogepant overall: 4.6%, placebo: 2.5%; Long-
term  Set:  atogepant  60  mg  QD:  23.4%,  SOC:  14.7%).  Throughout  the  12-week  DBT  period,  the 
incidence of weight decrease increased with atogepant dose (body weight decrease by > 7%: atogepant 
10 mg QD: 3.8%, atogepant 60 mg QD: 5.3%, atogepant 60 mg BID: 6.8%). The tendency for dose-
dependent decrease in body weight is adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
It has to be considered that about 14% of participants in the placebo-controlled analysis set had a history 
of obesity at baseline. Mean weight at baseline for all participants was 79.3 kg, and mean BMI was 28.86 
kg/m2, with 25% of participants weighing between 92.0 and 226 kg and 25% of participants with a BMI 
between 33.18 and 82.0 kg/m2. Analysis of a potential relationship between clinically significant weight 
decrease and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) at baseline revealed that obese patients were not more likely to 
significantly lose weight under atogepant treatment as compared to normal-weight subjects. Conversely, 
normal weight subjects (BMI < 30 kg/m2) appeared to be more liable to significantly lose weight based 
on comparison with the matched placebo group (atogepant overall [N=1133]: 5.6%, placebo [N=426]: 
1.6%). 
Transferability between EM and CM population 
There were no relevant differences between the EM and CM populations in the PCS set both by the nature 
and frequency of most common observed AEs. This is considered to provide further assurance regarding 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 116/136 
 
  
 
 
transferability of safety data across populations. Long-term studies in the EM population (302 and 309) 
were completed and full CSRs were submitted. For the CM population, however, respective long-term 
studies (306 and 312) are still ongoing and only interim safety data per cutoff date 11 October 2022 
could be filed. 
2.7.1.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on data obtained from the clinical trials, the safety profile of atogepant in preventive migraine 
treatment  appears  favourable.  Most  common  ADRs  were  nausea  (7%),  constipation  (7%),  and 
fatigue/somnolence (5%). No safety concerns for hypertension AEs or other cardiovascular events were 
identified. Decreases in body weight by > 7% from baseline were observed in atogepant patients in a 
dose-dependent way both under placebo-controlled and long-term treatment conditions.  
A thorough and comprehensive overall evaluation of atogepant’s hepatic safety profile was submitted 
incl. updates of ongoing long-term safety studies 306 /312 and growing post-marketing experience.  
The  proposals  to  address  hepatic  safety  (inclusion  of  ALT  /  AST  elevations  in  SmPC  section  4.8,  and 
prolongation  of  ongoing  LT  study  312  for  another  12  months  to  an  overall  duration  of  3  years)  are 
endorsed.

this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.2.  Disease or condition 
Migraine  is  a  serious,  chronic,  disabling  neurological  disease  characterised  by  attacks  of  moderate  to 
severe headache (HA) pain associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and 
phonophobia. Migraine attacks typically last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated or unsuccessfully treated. 
People with migraine may experience an aura prior to the onset of their headache. 
The indication proposed for Aquipta aligns with standard wordings approved for prophylactic treatment 
of migraine so far. 
3.2.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  range  of  established  oral  migraine  preventive  treatment  options  (ß-blockers,  topiramate, 
antidepressants etc.) most recently was complemented by CGRP antagonist antibodies (ABs, so-called 
biologicals)  targeting  circulating  CGRP  or  its  receptor  (erenumab,  fremanezumab,  galcanezumab).  All 
three ABs are indicated in the EU for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days 
per month. These ABs are injected following 4-week, resp. 12-week dosing intervals. Compliance is a 
well-documented  problem  in  migraine  preventive  therapy.  The  extended  dosing  intervals  of  the 
biologicals  may  therefore  be  interpreted  as  beneficial  by  increasing  compliance  of  the  patients. 
Irrespective of the compliance aspect, potential advantages for atogepant as a needle-free treatment 
option may be that it allows flexible treatment if immediate cessation of therapy is required, e.g. in case 
a serious AE or pregnancy. 
Among currently approved preventive treatment options, anticonvulsant topiramate (e.g., Topamax) is 
indicated in the EU in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine headache after careful evaluation of possible 
alternative treatment options. Botox (botulinum toxin type A from Clostridium botulinum) is indicated in 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 120/136 
 
  
 
 
 
the EU for prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine (headaches on at least 15 days per 
month  of  which  at  least  8  days  are  with  migraine).  Preventive  treatment  of  CM  with  Botox  requires 
multiple bilateral intramuscular injections divided across 7 specific head and neck muscle areas, with a 
recommended retreatment schedule of every 12 weeks.  
These  options  are  not  optimal  for  many  patients  due  to  limited  effectiveness,  poor  tolerability, 
contraindications,  and  the  need  for  dose  titration  over  multiple  visits  for  some  medications.  The 
limitations  in  conventional  oral  migraine  prevention treatments  lead  to  poor  adherence  (Berger  et  al. 
2012, Hepp et al. 2017) and reluctance to initiate prophylactic treatment (Silberstein 2015). 
Indeed,  several  epidemiological  surveys  indicate  that  available  migraine  preventive  treatments  are 
significantly underutilised in clinical practice (D’Amico et al. 2006), which supports the need for greater 
dialogue concerning migraine prevention between patients and physicians. Compliance with preventive 
treatment  remains  a  challenge.  Based  on  a  retrospective  US  claims  analysis  of  N=8707  CM  patients, 
persistence to initial oral preventive medication was only 25% at 6 months and 14% at 12 months follow-
up  (Hepp  et  al.  2017).  Low  adherence  to  migraine  prophylaxis  treatment  with  antidepressants, 
antiepileptics, or beta blockers at 6 month follow-up was also previously reported (Berger et al. 2012).  
3.2.2.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical data package in support of atogepant comprises phase II/III dose finding, pivotal efficacy/ 
safety studies in both the EM and CM population, and additional long-term tolerability studies, which also 
provide data to support maintenance of effect. 
Primary evidence for efficacy is derived from 2 pivotal studies, Study 301 (“Advance” study, conducted 
in the US) for EM prevention and Study 303 (“Progress” study, conducted at 142 sites in the US, Europe, 
Russia,  Japan,  Korea  and  others)  for  the  preventive  treatment  of  CM.  Additional  supportive  data  are 
provided by dose-finding Study CGP-MD-01 for EM prophylaxis.  
Furthermore,  two  long-term  open-label  studies  in  EM  (Study  3101-302-002)  [52-week  duration]  and 
Study  3101-309-002  [40-week  duration])  were  conducted.  Persistence  of  efficacy  data  in  EM  were 
obtained  from  long  term  study  302  including  de  novo  participants  and  patients  who  completed  dose 
finding Study CGP-MD-01. In long-term study 309, including rollover patients, who completed EM study 
301, maintenance of effect was not recorded. 
Studies 301 and 303 were 12-week, Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group  studies  comparing  atogepant  with  placebo  for  the  preventive  treatment  of  migraine  in 
participants with EM (Study 301; atogepant 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg QD) and in participants with CM 
(Study 303; atogepant 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD). 
Essential  features  of  prevention  studies  301  and  303  are  accordant  with  EU  Guideline  provisions 
(CPMP/EWP/788/01  Rev.1).  The  designs  of  studies  301  and  303  are  similar.  The  major  difference 
between the two studies lies in the target population (EM vs CM) and the atogepant dose range that was 
tested. While all once daily dose arms examined in dose finding study CGP-MD-01 (10 mg QD, 30 mg 
QD, 60 mg QD) were taken over into pivotal EM study 301, only the highest total daily dose of 60 mg 
atogepant (tested for the QD and BID dosing interval) was carried forward to the pivotal CM study 303.  
Inclusion criteria applied throughout pivotal studies align with the standard ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria 
(ICHD-3,  2018).  Any  medication  to  be  taken  for  acute  migraine  attacks  (incl.  triptans,  NSAIDS, 
acetaminophen etc.) was permissible. As concerns concomitant preventive migraine medication, there 
were differences between the EM and the CM study. While any medication with demonstrated efficacy 
for  the  prevention  of  migraine  (e.g.  amitriptyline,  topiramate,  propranolol  etc.)  was  prohibited  in  EM 
study  301,  participants  of  CM  study  303  could  take  one  preventive  medication  with  demonstrated 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 121/136 
 
  
 
 
efficacy.  At  study  entry,  about  83%  of  CM  subjects  reported  the  use  of  preventive  medication  in  the 
past. This is considered to reflect clinical practice in the more severely affected CM population. 
Standard and clinically meaningful efficacy endpoints were tested. The primary efficacy endpoint in both 
pivotal  studies  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  mean  monthly  migraine  days  across  the  12-week 
treatment  period  (DBT).  Further  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  for  superiority  of  atogepant  over 
placebo  while  controlling  for  multiplicity  in  studies  301/303.  The  three  most  relevant  was  the  change 
from baseline in mean monthly headache days across the 12-week DBT [S1], change from baseline in 
mean monthly acute medication use days across the 12-week [S2], and ≥ 50% reduction in 3-month 
average of monthly MDs as responder analysis [S3]. 
3.3.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy  of  atogepant  in  prevention  of  episodic  and  chronic  migraine  was  demonstrated  based  on 
statistically significant and clinically relevant results obtained across primary and secondary endpoints 
in both pivotal trials. The favourable outcome further translates into early onset of effect within the first 
month  of  treatment  and  persistence  of  effect  over  52-week  duration.  Robustness  of  data  was 
demonstrated  across  relevant  subgroups  per  baseline  disease  burden  (mean  monthly  MDs),  and 
prevalent medication overuse, resp. concomitant prophylactic treatment in CM participants. 
Primary: Reduction in MDs 
Like it could be observed in previous migraine prevention trials, a considerable placebo response was 
observed in both populations. Both EM and CM placebo patients reduced the number of mean monthly 
MDs by up to one third (EM: -2.5 MD [-32.8%], CM: -5.1 MD [-26.9%]). Superiority over placebo was 
shown for all atogepant treatment arms across the two trials. A numerical dose-response relationship 
was evident for the change from baseline in mean monthly MDs across the 12-week treatment period in 
Study 301, with greater reductions seen with increasing atogepant dose from 10 to 60 mg QD (LSMD 
over  placebo:  10  mg  QD:  -1.22,  30  mg  QD:  -1.38,  60  mg  QD:  -1.66).  The  placebo-corrected  mean 
reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days observed with the atogepant 60 mg QD dose 
was the same in the EM and CM studies (LSMD of –1.66 in both Study 301 and Study 303). 
Secondary endpoints 
A Headache Day (HD) is defined as any calendar day on which headache pain lasting 2 hours or longer 
occurs  unless  an  acute  headache  medication  (e.g.  ibuprofen,  triptan)  was  used  after  the  start  of  the 
headache.  As  such,  a  HD  captures  days  with  headache  irrespective  of  any  other  migraine-specific 
symptoms.  In  particular  in  CM  patients,  where  tension  type  headache  and  migraine  headache  often 
overlap, and who complain about highly frequent or almost continuous headache, measurement of HD 
is an important parameter for disease burden. Accordingly, reduction of HD from baseline during the 12-
week DBT was placed highest in hierarchical multiplicity testing [S1] of secondary endpoints. The results 
obtained  for  the  S1  secondary  endpoint  are  similar  to  those  obtained  for  the  primary  MD  reduction 
endpoint. Statistically significant superiority over placebo after multiplicity adjustment was achieved for 
each of the atogepant dosages tested in studies 301 and 303. Numerically more favourable results were 
obtained with increasing doses across the QD (10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg) dose arms in EM study 301. The 
net treatment effect over placebo was more favourable for the 30 mg BID dose arm as compared to the 
60 mg QD dose arm in study 303 (LSMD for HD reduction from baseline: 30 mg BID: -2.14, 60 mg QD: 
-1.72). 
At baseline, acute medication (incl. both unspecific analgesics and triptans) was used on a mean of 6-7 
days among EM patients and on about 15 days per month in the CM population. The change from baseline 
in  mean  monthly  acute  medication  use  days  [S2]  was  second  in  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 122/136 
 
  
 
 
endpoints.  For  both  the  Acute  Medication  Use  Day  and  the  Triptan  Use  Day  (which  was  singled  out) 
secondary endpoint significant superiority over placebo could be demonstrated for each atogepant dose 
arm. 
In  terms  of  the  >  50%  reduction  in  3-month  average  of  monthly  MDs  [S3],  statistically  significant 
superiority over placebo was achieved for each atogepant dose arm tested across studies 301 / 303. In 
study 301, more than 50% of subjects allocated to one of the atogepant dose arms achieved a reduction 
by > 50% in the 3-month average of monthly MDs (atogepant: 10 mg QD: 54.6%, 30 mg QD: 58.5%, 
60 mg QD: 59.3%; placebo 29.2%). This underlines the clinical relevance of the improvement achieved 
in terms of the primary MD reduction from baseline across all atogepant dose arms. Among the more 
severely affected CM population of study 303, response rates were slightly lower (30 mg BID: 42.1%, 
60 mg QD: 40.1%). Nonetheless, the probability of achieving a > 50% reduction in the 3-month average 
of monthly MDs was still about twice as high for atogepant as compared to placebo (OR: 30 mg BID: 
2.03, 60 mg QD: 1.90). 
Time course 
The major part of the overall treatment effect is achieved within the first 4-week dosing interval of the 
12-week  DBT  in  both  the  EM  and  CM  population.  Thereafter,  the  reduction  of  mean  monthly  MDs  is 
maintained  or  even  slightly  increases.  The  dose  response  relation  across  the  three  QD  dose  arms  of 
study 301 is consistently observed across the three 28-day intervals of the 12-week DBT. In CM study 
303, the more favourable effect of the 30 mg BID dosing regimen as compared to the 60 mg QD dosing 
scheme gets more pronounced with ongoing treatment duration. 
The course of treatment effect was further analysed per week for the first 28-day period of the DBT of 
studies 301 and 303. In both EM and CM patients, the treatment effect starts within the first week of 
treatment. There was no clear tendency of increasing or decreasing effect of atogepant over the four 1-
week intervals of the first 28-day treatment interval. This is considered to provide valuable information 
to  the  prescriber  when  the  treatment  effect  of  atogepant  is  evaluated  within  the  context  of  clinical 
monitoring. 
Persistence of effect 
In open-label, long-term study 302, the daily use of 60 mg atogepant QD (N=546) was compared to 
SOC  (N=198)  over  a  52-week  treatment  period  in  EM  patients,  either  recruited  de  novo  (85.6%)  or 
taken  over  from  dose  finding  study  MD-01  (14.4%).  Participants  randomised  to  oral  SOC  migraine 
preventive medication (topiramate: 35.7%, beta-blockers 26.0%, tricyclic antidepressants 25.5%) were 
included to contextualise safety results. 
It was primarily designed to examine safety of long term atogepant use in EM patients. However, efficacy 
was  also  monitored  in  those  subjects  randomised  to  atogepant.  In  atogepant  patients,  a  clinically 
relevant reduction in mean monthly MDs was achieved within the 1st month and was sustained over the 
1-year treatment period. Atogepant treatment led to a reduction in the LS mean number of monthly MDs 
in the first month (Weeks 1-4) of 3.84 days with continued improvement during the remainder of the 
52-week treatment period to a LS mean reduction of -5.19 days in the last month (Weeks 49 to 52). 
Overall,  it  is  noted  that  no  efficacy  assessment  was  performed  in  long-term  extension  study  309  (in 
completers of study 301). Nevertheless, the overall number of patients included in the other long-term 
study 302 in EM patients can be considered sufficient for the evaluation of a long-term efficacy.  
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Given  the  overall  positive  efficacy  results,  there  is  little  uncertainty  about  the  favourable  effects  of 
atogepant in the targeted population. However, there is some concern related to the choice of the dosing 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 123/136 
 
  
 
 
interval proposed for the atogepant 60 mg standard daily dose that is to be taken as a single dose (QD), 
while numerically more favourable results were obtained for the atogepant 30 mg BID dose arm. 
Proposed atogepant 60 mg QD dosing interval 
Apart from testing dose response in EM study 301 across the once daily 10, 30, 60 mg dose range, the 
effect of changing the dosing interval from once daily to twice daily was examined for the highest 60 mg 
daily dose in the CM population. A noticeable difference was observed in favour of the twice daily dosing 
schedule in terms of the net difference over placebo for the reduction of mean monthly MDs (Study 303: 
LSMD over placebo: 30 mg BID: -2.24, 60 mg QD: -1.66). The favourable treatment effect of the 30 mg 
BID regime (as compared to 60 mg QD) was analogously observed in phase II/III dose finding study 
MD-01  (reduction  in  mean  monthly  MDs  from  baseline:  30  mg  BID:  -4.0,  60  mg  QD:  -3.56).  It  also 
translates into most relevant secondary endpoints, like reduction of HDs, reduction of acute medication 
use, and 50% response rates. Further plausibility for the favourable outcome in the 30 mg BID treatment 
arm is provided by PK study P002. In study P002, plasma levels were compared for different atogepant 
doses  after  repetitive  dosing  over  10  days.  C24  hrs  trough  values  after  30  mg  BID  dosing  were 
remarkably high, higher than after 100 mg once daily dosing and almost reaching the level of the 170 
mg once daily regime. Despite numerically more favourable results for the 30 mg BID dose arm across 
primary and secondary endpoints, the applicant’s posology strategy is to confine to the uniform 60 mg 
once daily dosing schedule in order to provide a simple and convenient posology scheme. This is assumed 
to best promote patient compliance, which is an established challenge in migraine prevention. 
Potential rebound after treatment cessation. 
Both  in  EM  study  301  and  CM  study  303,  subjects  were  followed  up  for  another  4-week  period  after 
termination  of  the  12-week  DBT  or  early  discontinuation.  According  to  the  Schedule  of  Procedures  of 
Study 301, participants’ eDiary entries regarding headache were evaluated only in those patients who 
terminated  early,  but  not  in  patients  who  completed  the  entire  12-week  DBT.  Hence,  no  data  were 
provided  on  potential  rebound  of  migraine  after  cessation  of  study  medication  in  (all)  participants  of 
studies  301/303.  Instead,  efficacy  endpoint  MSQ  v2.1  Role  function-Restrictive  domain  scores  were 
collected  at  the  safety  follow-up  visit  (4  weeks  after  the  treatment  period).  As  indicated  by  smaller 
Change from Baseline values for MSQ RFR domain scores at 4 weeks Follow-up, the beneficial effect of 
atogepant treatment weans off after treatment cessation. However, the scores at the 4 week follow-up 
interview were still higher than baseline values, thereby showing that rebound effects in mean scores 
were not observed. 
3.5.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall  safety  data  as  obtained  from  RCTs  point  to  a  rather  favourable  safety  profile  of  atogepant. 
Concerns  about  hepatic  safety  of  atogepant,  however,  have  arisen  after  receipt  of  a  post-marketing 
report of possible DILI that was observed in a female patient during the first months of marketing in the 
US. 
Overall exposure to atogepant is sufficiently large. A total of N=3230 unique participants (including 604 
healthy volunteers, 656 participants with CM, and 1970 EM patients) were exposed to at least 1 dose of 
atogepant  during  clinical  development.  With  regard  to  the  duration  of  exposure,  the  minimum 
requirements as specified per ICH E1 Guidance are fulfilled. 
Most common adverse events 
Atogepant preventive migraine treatment was well tolerated. The most common AEs in any atogepant 
group (≥ 5% of participants) were nausea, constipation, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. 
Of these, constipation, nausea, and fatigue were considered as related to study drug in the majority of 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 124/136 
 
  
 
 
cases. In particular, for nausea (atogepant: 7.5%, placebo 3.3%) and constipation (atogepant: 7.2%, 
placebo: 2.0%) reporting rates in atogepant patients were higher as compared to placebo. Constipation 
is also labelled as common adverse reaction to biological CGRP antagonists erenumab and galzanezumab. 
Of note, the AE of decreased appetite was reported about ten times more often in atogepant patients 
(2.1%) as compared to placebo (0.2%). There was no clear dose response relation for the rate of TEAEs 
across the atogepant doses, ranging from atogepant 10 mg QD to supra-therapeutic atogepant 60 mg 
BID in the PCS set. 
In  long-term  safety  study  302,  a  SOC  arm  was  included  to  contextualise  safety.  The  rate  of  patients 
showing  TEAEs  was  lower  for  atogepant  60  mg  QD  (N=1662,  63.5%)  as  compared  to  SOC  (N=196, 
78.6%). However, interpretation is cautioned given the disparity of underlying datasets. 
The number and percentage of participants with common AE in the LTS set reveals good tolerability of 
long-term  atogepant  60  mg  QD  use  as  compared  to  the  standard  of  care  control  arm.  Of  those  AEs 
observed in the PCS set which were considered related to study drug, only constipation was reported 
more often for atogepant 60 mg QD (6.0%) as compared to SOC (3.1%). 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were determined by evaluating TEAEs in the placebo-controlled migraine 
studies (Studies MD-01, 301, and 303) that occurred with a ≥ 2% overall incidence rate in any of the 
atogepant  groups  and  at  a  rate  at  least  2%  greater  than  placebo.  Constipation,  decreased  appetite, 
nausea, and fatigue/somnolence were identified as ADRs. 
Serious Adverse events (SAE) 
The  overall  incidence  of  SAE  in  the  PSC  set  was  low  across  atogepant  treatment  arms  (<  1.3%)  and 
similar to placebo (1.1%). None of the observed SAE was reported in more than 1 participant. 
In  the  LTS  set,  the  overall  rate  of  TESAE  was  higher  in  patients  receiving  SOC  (N=196,  3.6%)  as 
compared  to  patients  receiving  atogepant  60  mg  QD  (N=1662,  3.4%).  Importantly,  there  is  no 
accumulation of any SAE. For the vast majority of SAE per preferred term the frequency in atogepant 
subjects is 0.1%. This includes Hepatobiliary disorders (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis) and Investigations 
(ALT  increased,  AST  increased).  There  wasn’t  any  cardiovascular  SAE  under  long-term  atogepant 
treatment. 
Adverse Events of special interest (AESI) 
Cardiovascular  events  (cardiac  arrythmias,  central  nervous  system  vascular  disorders,  embolic  and 
thrombotic, hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease), hepatic AEs, suicide-related events, and abuse-
related AEs were identified as AESIs for the placebo-controlled, long-term safety, and Phase 1 analysis 
sets. 
Cardiovascular Events 
A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular safety of atogepant as TEAESI was provided for both the 
use  of  atogepant  under  placebo-controlled  conditions  and  long-term  over  52-weeks.  There  was  no 
incident of ischaemic heart disease. The incidence of arrhythmia-related AEs was low and similar between 
atogepant (0.3%) and placebo (0.2%). Across the PCS and LTS set, only two cases of hypertension as 
reported AE were considered by the Investigator as related to study medication. Based on the narratives, 
however,  there  is  no  clear  suspect  of  atogepant  having  a  causative  role  given  the  overall  medical 
conditions of concerned subjects and timing of reporting (resp. persistence of the event) in relation to 
atogepant treatment. 
Hepatic Safety 
Historical  clinical  development  programs  for  other  members  of  the  gepant  family  (telcagepant)  were 
halted  when  liver  toxicity  was  detected  during  migraine  prophylaxis  trials  (Ho  TW.  Neurology  2014). 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 125/136 
 
  
 
 
Therefore,  AEs  related  to  hepatic  toxicity  were  systematically  evaluated  as  AEs  of  special  interest, 
including blinded adjudication of post-baseline elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN for participants 
who received either atogepant or placebo by an external expert committee. 
Incidence of hepatic injury, AST/ALT elevations 
Absolute figures for the incidence of hepatic injury and/or any liver enzyme elevation (> 1  x ULN) in 
atogepant patients as compared to placebo appear favourable. 
• 
In  the  Placebo-controlled  Analysis  Set,  hepatic  injury  TEAE  overall  (atogepant:  1.5%,  placebo: 
1.8%),  and  hepatic  enzyme  elevations  (ALT  increased:  atogepant:  1.1%,  placebo:  1.5%;  AST 
increased: atogepant: 1.0%, placebo: 1.4%) were observed more often in placebo patients than in 
participants receiving atogepant. The incidence of ALT or AST increase as TEAE was independent of 
the atogepant dose. 
•  Categorical analysis of liver enzyme elevations shows that any aminotransferase elevation (AST or 
ALT > 1 x ULN) was observed more frequently under placebo (14.2%) as compared to all atogepant 
patients (10.9%) in the PCS set. 
• 
Likewise,  under  long  term  treatment  (LTS  set),  the incidence  of  hepatic  injury  overall  (atogepant 
2.5%, SOC 3.1%), and aminotransferase elevations as TEAE (AST increased: atogepant 1.7%, SOC 
2.6%; ALT increased: atogepant 1.6%, SOC: 2.0%) was higher in participants receiving standard-
of-care as compared to atogepant. 
•  Analysis  of  enzyme  elevation  categories  in  the  long-term  analysis  set  reveals  that  any 
aminotransferase  elevation  (AST  or  ALT  >  1  x  ULN)  was  observed  more  frequently  across  SOC 
patients under long term treatment (28.9%) as compared to atogepant 60 mg QD patients (14.4%). 
Adjudication of relationship to treatment 
• 
In  the  PCS  set,  a  total  of  n=24/2500  cases  with  aminotransferase  elevations  >  3  x  ULN  were 
adjudicated by the external blinded Expert Committee. Of these, n=17 subjects received atogepant 
(n=7  received  placebo).  Among  the  atogepant  patients,  n=4  subjects  (out  of  N=1837)  were 
adjudicated as either possible (n=2) or probably related (n=2) to atogepant treatment. Narratives 
were provided. In 3 of these cases, there were confounding factors like intensive weightlifting in the 
gym, extensive concomitant acetaminophen use for acute headache, or Class III obesity (BMI 39.6 
kg/m2). All 4 atogepant-treated cases that were adjudicated as probably or possibly related to study 
drug  were  asymptomatic,  non-serious,  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  without  concurrent  bilirubin 
elevations, and resolved with or without atogepant discontinuation. 
• 
In the LTS set, a total of n=24/1662 patients with hepatic enzyme elevations > 3 x ULN under long-
term  atogepant  treatment  were  adjudicated.  In  eight  cases,  the  relationship  of  aminotransferase 
elevations to study drug was rated as possible or probable. Narratives were provided. In subjects 
recruited for long-term studies 302 and 309, confounding factors like weightlifting, obesity, history 
of binge drinking, or transient periods of increased alcohol consumption are reported and subjects 
completed the study. The remaining cases are reported for long-term study 306 conducted in Japan. 
Atogepant treatment was discontinued in n=4 subjects from study 306, for which the relationship to 
study drug was rated possible or probable. In these cases, confounding factors (e.g. concomitant 
betahistine,  cephalosporin,  azithromycin)  are  less  clear.  Of  note,  among  the  8  cases  that  were 
adjudicated as probably or possibly related to study drug all were non-serious, mild to moderate in 
severity,  without  concurrent  bilirubin  elevation,  and  resolved  with  or  without  atogepant 
discontinuation. 
In the clinical trial dataset (placebo-controlled and long-term), there was no case fulfilling criteria for 
potential Hy’s Law (ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and TBL > 2 x ULN and ALP < 2 x ULN). 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023  
Page 126/136 
 
  
 
 
Hence,  the  overall  hepatic  safety  profile  of  atogepant,  as  obtained  from  clinical  trials,  appears  rather 
favourable.  However,  a  re-evaluation  of  atogepant’s  hepatic  safety  was  required  after  receipt  of  one 
spontaneous  post-marketing  report  of  acute  liver  failure  with  atogepant  60  mg  QD  that  led  to  liver 
transplantation. 
3.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Hepatic safety 
Across  the  placebo-controlled  (PCS),  long-term  (LTS)  and  post-marketing  datasets,  clinically  relevant 
enzyme elevations were observed in patients receiving atogepant (although mostly asymptomatic across 
clinical  trials).  In  some  of  these  cases,  AST/ALT  elevations  were  adjudicated  as  possibly  or  probably 
related to atogepant treatment based on positive dechallenge and / or absence of clear confounders.  
For the clinical trial dataset, it is confirmed that the elevations of aminotransferases that are probably or 
possibly  related  to  atogepant  were  mostly  asymptomatic,  all  were  non-serious,  mild  to  moderate  in 
severity, without concurrent bilirubin elevations and transient in nature. There were no Hy's law cases, 
coagulopathy, encephalopathy or other organ dysfunction, hospitalisation, liver transplant, acute liver 
failure, or death due to liver injury in the clinical development programme of atogepant.  
Conversely, in the post marketing setting, two cases of serious liver-related events have been reported. 
The  first  relates  to the  female  experiencing  acute  liver  failure  (on  Day  127  after  atogepant initiation) 
leading to liver transplant. With extended post-marketing surveillance (data lock-off 11 October 2022) 
another suspected case of serious liver-related events (liver cirrhosis) was reported (at the time of first 
reporting without any further background information). The case of the female patient concerns non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosed in 2016, i.e. about six years before 30 mg atogepant was 
initiated  (Oct  2022).  Hence,  the  suspected  second  case  of  serious  post-marketing  hepatotoxicity  is 
unlikely to be related to atogepant therapy. 
The fact that the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations was not increased in atogepant patients 
as compared to patients receiving placebo in the PCS dataset, or to subjects receiving SOC in LT study 
302 is providing reassurance. In line with results obtained from the DILIsym model (including in vitro 
tests of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis) atogepant 
is not considered to intrinsically induce hepatotoxicity. 
Graphical presentations of Time to onset (TTO) were provided on the cumulative number of atogepant 
participants  with  ALT  /AST  elevations  >  3  x  ULN  across  the  PCS  and  LTS  set to  further  elucidate  the 
relation  between  atogepant  exposure  and  liver  enzyme  elevations.  Overall,  the  TTO  of  all  atogepant-
treated  cases  of  aminotransferase  elevation  ≥  3  ×  ULN  was  wide  both  in  the  PCS  and  LTS  studies, 
ranging from the first week after treatment initiation to the end of the observation period (12+4 weeks 
for  PCS,  >  1  year  for  LTS).  Hence,  no  temporal  relation  between  atogepant  exposure  and  enzyme 
elevations could be established.  
Further issues of uncertainty 
There was one SAE of presumed optic neuritis, which was considered as related to study drug by the 
Investigator,  but  was  considered  not  related  by  the  Sponsor.  Irrespective  of  any  attempt  to 
retrospectively  decide  upon  potential  relatedness  of  the  single  SAE  of  presumed  optic  neuritis,  it  is 
suggested to examine future PSUR reports for potential signals in this regard.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.9.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy 
Dose-finding  study  MD-01  and  pivotal  studies  301  (EM  population)  and  303  (CM  population)  were 
designed concordant with IHS and EMA guidance and provide a sound database demonstrating evidence 
for the benefit of atogepant in preventive migraine treatment across the full spectrum of episodic and 
chronic forms of the disease.  
Atogepant in dosages of 10, 30, and 60 mg QD in EM and 60 mg QD and 30 mg BID in CM demonstrated 
superiority over placebo in reducing the frequency of both migraine days [primary P1], as well as the 
frequency of headache days [secondary S1] and the associated use of medication for the acute treatment 
of migraine [S2]. Higher response rates were seen with each atogepant dosage compared with placebo 
for participants with ≥ 50% reduction in the 3-month average of monthly migraine days [S3]. 
A numerical dose-response relationship was evident for the change from baseline in mean monthly MDs 
across the 12-week DBT in EM Study 301, with greater reductions seen with increasing atogepant dose 
from 10 to 60 mg QD. Only the highest maximum daily dose of 60 mg tested in EM study 301 was taken 
over in CM Study 303. To explore the potential impact of the once daily vs twice daily dosing regimen, 
the 60 mg daily dose was examined across a 60 mg QD and a 30 mg BID treatment arm in CM Study 
303. The placebo-corrected mean reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days observed with 
the atogepant 60 mg QD dose was the same in the EM and CM studies (LSMD of –1.66 in both Study 
301 and 303). 
The robustness of the primary and secondary endpoint results [S1-3] after multiplicity adjustment for 
each  of  the  atogepant  dosages  tested  in  studies  301/303  was  confirmed  across  several  subgroup 
analyses,  like  e.g.  prior  use  of  prevention  medication,  concomitant  use  of  another  prophylactic 
medication (study 303), or prevalent medication overuse (study 303). 
The  onset  of  the  clinical  effect  of  atogepant  is  early.  In  both  the  EM  and  CM  population,  the  overall 
treatment effect in terms of MD reduction is achieved mainly within the first 28-day period of the 12-
week DBT of studies 301 and 303. 
In terms of persistence of effect, supportive efficacy data are obtained from open-label, long-term study 
302 in EM patients for treatment with atogepant 60 QD over 52 weeks. A clinically relevant reduction in 
mean monthly MDs was achieved within the 1st month and was sustained over the 1-year treatment 
period. 
Overall, efficacy was adequately demonstrated for the proposed use of atogepant in migraine prevention. 
Posology 
With  regard  to  proposed  posology,  the  numerically  most  favourable  outcome  across  primary  and 
secondary endpoints in studies MD-01 (EM) and pivotal study 303 (CM) was observed for the 30 mg BID 
dosing regimen. However, the applicant applies for the 60 mg QD once daily as regular dosing scheme 
only.  It  is  established  that  compliance  with  migraine  preventive  treatment  remains  a  challenge. 
Therefore, the potential advantage of a once daily dosing regimen is evident in terms of compliance. On 
the other hand, administration of the most effective treatment is equally expected to positively impact 
on patient compliance. A  30 mg tablet formulation was tested in Study 301,  i.e. is available. Despite 
numerically  more  favourable  results  for  the  30  mg  BID  dose  arm  across  primary  and  secondary 
EMA/CHMP/326142/2023

endpoints, the applicant’s posology strategy is to confine to the uniform 60 mg once daily dosing schedule 
in order to provide a simple and convenient posology scheme. 
Safety 
Based on data obtained from the clinical trials, the safety profile of atogepant in preventive migraine 
treatment  appears  favourable.  Most  common  ADRs  were  nausea  (7%),  constipation  (7%),  and 
fatigue/somnolence (5%). No safety concerns for hypertension AEs or other cardiovascular events were 
identified. Decreases in body weight by > 7% from baseline were observed in atogepant patients in a 
dose-dependent way both under placebo-controlled and long-term treatment conditions. 
Concerns about atogepant’s hepatic safety profile were raised after receipt of a post-marketing report of 
a female who developed acute liver failure leading to liver transplant on Day 127 of atogepant 60 mg 
treatment for migraine prophylaxis. An independent expert confirmed the event to be compatible with 
DILI and timing as consistent with a role for atogepant.  
In-depth  evaluation  of  atogepant’s  hepatic  safety  profile  was  provided  based  on  modelled  DILIsym 
results,  the  PCS  dataset,  extended  long-term  data  (from  ongoing  studies  306  and  312),  and  further 
post-marketing experience (cumulative patient exposure / sales data from 28 Sep 2021 to 31 Oct 2022). 
The fact that the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations was not increased in atogepant patients 
as compared to patients receiving placebo in the PCS dataset, or to subjects receiving SOC in LT study 
302 is providing reassurance. In line with results obtained from the DILIsym model (including in vitro 
tests of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis) atogepant 
is not considered to intrinsically induce hepatotoxicity. 
A potential idiosyncratic liability, however, may only manifest with temporal latency, and due to its 
rarity, in larger populations. Across the placebo-controlled (PCS), long-term (LTS) and post-marketing 
datasets, clinically relevant enzyme elevations were observed in patients receiving atogepant (although 
mostly asymptomatic across clinical trials). In some of these cases, AST/ALT elevations were 
adjudicated as possibly or probably related to atogepant treatment based on positive dechallenge and / 
or absence of clear confounders.  
3.9.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy was adequately shown for the proposed use of atogepant for prophylaxis of migraine in adults 
who have at least 4 migraine days per month. In-depth evaluation of atogepant’s hepatic safety profile 
provided reassurance.

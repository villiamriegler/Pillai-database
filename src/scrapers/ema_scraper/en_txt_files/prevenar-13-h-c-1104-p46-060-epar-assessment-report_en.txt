2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study B1851172: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Single-Arm, Open-Label Study to 
Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Single Dose of 13-
Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Japanese Subjects Aged 6 to 64 
Years Who are Considered to be at Increased Risk of Pneumococcal Disease 
and Who are Naive to Pneumococcal Vaccines 
Description 
The morbidity and mortality of non-invasive and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) is a public health concern across the globe, including 
Japan1. While young children and elderly adults are particularly susceptible to pneumococcal disease 
(PD), individuals 6 to 64 years of age with certain underlying medical conditions are also considered to 
be at increased risk of PD. In addition, the treatment of pneumococcal infections is becoming more 
difficult because of a global increase in prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. 
Pfizer developed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) for use in infants and young 
children, and subsequently in adults to prevent PD caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes 
(serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) contained in the vaccine.  To 
overcome the limited immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharide (PS) vaccines, which elicit a 
T-cell–independent immune response, protein conjugation technology was applied to 13vPnC.  Each of 
the pneumococcal PS is covalently conjugated to the diphtheria cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197) 
protein to elicit a T-cell–dependent immune response, leading to immunological memory and boosting 
upon repeated vaccination. 
In Japan, 13vPnC has been approved for children aged ≥2 months to <6 years and adults aged 
≥65 years but it is not approved for use in the 6- to 64-year age group in Japan.  In view of its 
regulatory status and the epidemiology and prevalence of IPD cases in Japan, development of 13vPnC 
in Japanese individuals aged 6 to <65 years at increased risk of PD has been advocated by Japanese 
physicians and their professional associations. Therefore, Pfizer conducted Study B1851172 to address 
the unmet medical needs in the 6- to 64-year age group, the vaccine gap between Japan and other 
countries, and the request from professional associations.  This study assessed the safety, tolerability 
and immunogenicity of a single dose of 13vPnC in Japanese individuals aged 6 to 64 years who were 
considered to be at increased risk of PD and who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccine.  The large 
database of safety data from clinical studies in Japan and globally including in healthy individuals, 
immunocompetent individuals with underlying stable medical conditions, and individuals with 
immunocompromised status, and the extensive post-marketing experience supported conduct of 
single-arm, open-label safety and immunogenicity study. 
Methods 
Safety Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 13vPnC 
as measured by the incidence of local reactions, systemic events, adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs).

Immunogenicity Objectives 
The secondary objective of this study was to describe the immune responses elicited by a single dose 
of 13vPnC. 
•  Serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) 1 month after 
vaccination in all age groups. 
•  Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) in serotype-specific OPA titers from before vaccination to 
1 month after vaccination in all age groups. 
•  Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC)s 1 month after vaccination in all 
age groups. 
•  GMFRs in serotype-specific IgG from before vaccination to 1 month after vaccination in all age 
groups. 
Study design  
Study B1851172 was a Phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(13vPnC) in Japanese subjects aged 6 to 64 years who were considered to be at increased risk of 
pneumococcal disease (PD) and who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccines. 
This study consisted of 2 age groups: 6 to <18 and 18 to <65 years old.  Approximately 200 subjects 
were to be enrolled: approximately 50 subjects in the 6- to <18-year age group and approximately 
150 subjects in the 18- to <65-year age group.  For the purpose of ensuring a minimum number of 
subjects in each of the age categories, at least 15 subjects aged 6 to <12 years and 15 subjects aged 
12 to <18 years were to be enrolled within the 6- to <18-year age group.  Furthermore, at least 50 
subjects aged 18 to <50 years and 50 subjects aged 50 to <65 years were to be enrolled within the 
18- to <65-year age group.  Subjects participated in the study for approximately 1 month (29 to 43 
days).  
All subjects received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC intramuscularly at Visit 1 (Day 1). In total, 2 
blood samples were collected at Day 1 prior to receipt of investigational product (IP) and 1 month later 
(28 to 42 days after Visit 1) for assessment of the immune responses. A quantitative functional 
opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay and Luminex-based antibody binding assay were used to 
measure antibody-mediated serum OPA and serum concentrations of anticapsular immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) antibodies for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes, respectively. 
Starting on the day of vaccination, local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) 
were recorded in the e-diary for 7 days by the subject’s legally acceptable representative/parent/legal 
guardian for subjects aged 6 to <18 years or 14 days by the subject for subjects aged 18 to <65 
years. 
Starting on the day of vaccination, systemic events (fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle 
pain, and joint pain), axillary temperature, and the use of antipyretic medication and pain medication 
for treatment of symptoms were recorded in the e-diary for 7 days by the subject’s legally acceptable 
representative/parent/legal guardian for subjects aged 6 to <18 years or 14 days by the subject for 
subjects aged 18 to <65 years. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of >37.5°C and analyzed 
as a systemic event. 
Adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs (SAEs; were recorded on the AE page(s) of the case report 
form (CRF) from the time the subject/legally acceptable representative/parent/legal guardian provided 
informed consent through and including Visit 2.

Study population /Sample size 
Japanese males and females aged 6 to <65 years with an increased risk of PD were enrolled in this 
study.   All 206 screened subjects (200 planned for enrollment) were enrolled and completed the 
study.  
No enrolled subjects were excluded from the all-available immunogenicity population or the evaluable 
immunogenicity population and therefore the all-available and evaluable immunogenicity populations 
were identical. 
Treatments 
All subjects received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC intramuscularly at Visit 1 (Day 1). 
Per 0.5-mL dose, the vaccine is formulated to contain 4.4 μg of saccharide from pneumococcal 
serotype 6B and 2.2 μg of each of the other 12 saccharides (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
and 23F).

Statistical Methods 
Descriptive summaries included the following statistics: number and percent of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Other estimations are presented below. 
Geometric Mean: For each serotype, OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and IgG geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) were calculated. 
Geometric Mean Fold Rise: For each serotype, OPA and IgG geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were 
calculated. 
Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curve: For each serotype, the empirical reverse cumulative 
distribution  curves (RCDCs) plotted the percentage of subjects achieving a given titer or 
concentration. 
Methods to Manage Missing Data and Data Below the Lower Limit of Quantitation: For the analysis of 
the immunogenicity endpoints, missing values were retained as missing and were not imputed. For 
OPA titers and IgG concentrations, values below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were set to 0.5 
× LLOQ for analysis. 
Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations are presented below. 
• 
• 
• 
Safety Analysis Set: the safety population included all subjects who received 1 dose of study 
vaccine. The safety population was the only analysis population for the primary endpoints. 
Evaluable Immunogenicity Population: the evaluable immunogenicity population was the 
primary immunogenicity analysis population. It included subjects who met the following: 
1.  Were eligible for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
2.  Received the study vaccine 
3.  Received no prohibited vaccines. 
4.  Had blood drawn within the specified time frame 1 month after vaccination (28 to 42 days 
after Visit 1 [i.e., Day 29 to Day 43 when Day 1 was vaccination visit]). 
5.  Had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result (OPA titer or IgG concentration) for at 
least 1 serotype 1 month after vaccination. 
6.  Had no major protocol violations as determined by the sponsor’s clinician, or any other 
protocol deviations that would materially affect assessment of immunogenicity endpoints. 
All-Available Immunogenicity Population: The all-available immunogenicity population included 
all subjects who were enrolled, received the study vaccine, and had at least 1 valid and 
determinate assay result (OPA titer or IgG concentration) for at least 1 serotype 1 month after 
vaccination.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All 206 screened subjects (200 planned for enrolment) were enrolled and completed the study. 53 
subjects were at age between 6 to 18. 
No enrolled subjects were excluded from the all-available immunogenicity population or the evaluable 
immunogenicity population and therefore the all-available and evaluable immunogenicity populations 
were identical. 
Baseline data 
Overall, 51.9% of subjects were male and 48.1% of subjects were female; all subjects were Japanese. 
The mean ages at vaccination were 12.7 years (range: 7 to 17 years) in the 6- to <18-year age group 
and 49.0 years (range: 20 to 64 years) in the 18- to <65-year age group. Considering individuals who 
smoke are considered to be at increased risk for developing PD, it is worth noting that 22.2% and 
22.9% of subjects aged ≥18 years were current or former smokers, respectively, at the time of 
enrolment. 
Demographic characteristics for the all-available immunogenicity and evaluable immunogenicity 
populations were the same as for the safety population. 
Among subjects aged 6 to <18 years, the most common chronic medical conditions that put these 
subjects at increased risk of PD (and cited in ≥5% of subjects) were grouped under the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs) of: cardiac disorders; 
congenital, familial and genetic disorders; hepatobiliary disorders; neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified; renal and urinary disorders; respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  
The most common preferred terms (PTs) that investigators considered increased the risk of PD were: 
asthma, type 1 DM, nephrotic syndrome, type 2 DM, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and acute lymphocytic 
leukaemia. In addition, 15.1% of subjects were treated with immunosuppressive therapy during the 
study, which was also considered a factor that increased risk of PD in these subjects. 
Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity Results: 
For subjects aged 6 to <65 years, opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) GMTs for each of the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes were higher 1 month after vaccination compared to before vaccination. The 
OPA GMFRs observed from baseline to 1 month after vaccination ranged from 5.5 to 61.7 and the 
lower limits of the 2-sided, 95% CIs for the OPA GMFRs were >1 for each of the 13 serotypes, 
indicating that subjects had an immune response to the vaccine.  
OPA GMT increases and OPA GMFRs were generally higher in subjects aged 6 to <18 years compared 
to subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
The majority of subjects (range: 78.9% to 95.0%) aged 6 to <65 years achieved an OPA titer ≥ lower 
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) 1 month after vaccination for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes. The 
proportions of subjects who achieved an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ were generally higher in subjects aged 6 to 
18 years compared to subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
The majority of subjects (range: 56.4% to 80.9%) aged 6 to <65 years achieved a ≥4-fold increase in 
OPA titer for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes. The proportions of subjects who achieved a ≥4-

fold increase in OPA titer were generally higher in subjects aged 6 to <18 years compared to subjects 
aged 18 to <65 years. 
For subjects aged 6 to <65 years, reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDCs) for each of the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes showed higher proportions of subjects that achieved a given OPA titer 1 
month after vaccination compared to before vaccination. The proportions of subjects achieving the 
specified pneumococcal OPA titer for each of the 13 serotypes 1 month after vaccination were 
generally higher across the full range of antibody titers in subjects aged 6 to <18 years compared to 
subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
For subjects aged 6 to <65 years, IgG GMCs for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were low 
before vaccination and higher 1 month after vaccination. The IgG GMFRs observed from baseline to 1 
month after vaccination ranged from 4.605 to 47.565 and the lower limits of the 2-sided, 95% CIs for 
the IgG GMFRs were >1 for each of the 13 serotypes, indicating that subjects had an immune response 
to the vaccine. IgG GMC increases and IgG GMFRs were generally higher in subjects aged 6 to <18 
years compared to subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
The majority of subjects (range: 73.3% to 89.3%) aged 6 to <65 years achieved a ≥4-fold increase in 
IgG concentration for each of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes except for serotype 3 (49.0% of 
subjects). The proportions of subjects who achieved a ≥4-fold increase in IgG concentration were 
generally higher in subjects aged 6 to <18 years compared to subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
For subjects aged 6 to <65 years, RCDCs for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes showed higher 
proportions of subjects achieved a given IgG concentration 1 month after vaccination compared to 
before vaccination. The proportions of subjects achieving the specified pneumococcal IgG 
concentrations for each of the 13 serotypes 1 month after vaccination were generally higher in subjects 
aged 6 to <18 years compared to subjects aged 18 to <65 years. 
Overall, a single administration of 13vPnC in Japanese subjects aged 6 to <65 years who were 
considered to be at increased risk of PD (and who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccines) elicited robust 
immune responses 1 month after vaccination.

Safety results 
The majority of subjects reported any local reactions within 7 days after vaccination in the 6- to <18-
year age group (82.7%) and 14 days after vaccination in the 18- to <65-year age group (67.1%). In 
both age groups, pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction. The 
majority of local reactions were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 case of severe swelling in 
the 6- to <18-year age group and 2 cases of severe pain at the injection site in the 18- to <65-year 
age group. The proportions of subjects who reported local reactions were generally higher in the 6- to 
<18-year age group than in the 18- to <65-year age group. 
Table 3. Local reactions after vaccination with Prevenar 13 among 6 to 18 year old Japanese 
The majority of subjects reported any systemic events within 7 days after vaccination in the 6- to <18-
year age group (60.8%) and 14 days after vaccination in the 18- to <65-year age group (58.6%). In 
both age groups, the 3 most frequently reported systemic events were fatigue, muscle pain, and 
headache. The majority of systemic events were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 case each 
of severe fatigue and severe headache in the 6- to <18-year age group, and 1 case each of severe 
diarrhoea, severe muscle pain, and severe joint pain in the 18- to <65-year age group. The 
proportions of subjects who reported systemic events were broadly similar in the 6- to <18-year and 
18- to <65-year age groups.

Overall, few AEs were reported (16.0% of subjects overall). There were no SAEs, life-threatening AEs, 
or immediate AEs reported during the study. There were no deaths, and no subjects were withdrawn 
for safety-related reasons during the study. 
AEs that were assessed by the investigator to be related to IP were reported by 6 (2.9%) subjects. 
These were mild events associated with IP injection site reaction, except for 1 event each of decreased 
appetite and middle insomnia. 
Two (2) subjects reported severe AEs, including 1 AE of severe back pain and 1 AE of severe asthma, 
neither of which was assessed as vaccine related.  
Overall, 13vPnC was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in Japanese subjects aged 6 to 
<65 years who were considered at increased risk of PD and naïve to pneumococcal vaccines. 
Conclusions  
In Japanese individuals aged 6 to <65 years who were considered to be at increased risk of PD and 
who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccines, 13vPnC was immunogenic for each of the 13 serotypes and 
was well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. The results support the extension of the indication 
of 13vPnC for the prevention of PD in Japan. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Present study confirmed immunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 among Japanese individuals aged 6 
to <65 years. The results are in agreement with previously reported studies. No concern regarding 
lacking efficacy is raised from this study.  
The study population was relatively small (N= 206) and including only small fraction of children at age 
6 to <18 (N=53) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. The safety results are 
also in agreement with previously reported studies. No new safety concern is raised from this study.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered 
fulfilled.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

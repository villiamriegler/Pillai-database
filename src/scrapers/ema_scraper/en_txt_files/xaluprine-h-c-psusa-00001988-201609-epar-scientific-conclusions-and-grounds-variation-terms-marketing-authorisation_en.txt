Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for mercaptopurine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Patients receiving treatment with 6-mercaptopurine who develop myelosuppression are at increased risk 
of developing infections. Considering the spontaneous case reports of infections received and those 
published, including serious infections such as hepatitis B, varicella zoster and pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia during the reporting period of this PSUSA, and the potential temporal relationship, the 
PRAC supported the MAH’s proposal to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning regarding 
and to add ‘bacterial and viral infections’ and ‘infections associated with neutropenia’ as new adverse 
drug reactions with an ‘uncommon’ frequency in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Based on recent publications, it can be concluded that the risk of induced leukopenia and alopecia from 
thiopurines is significantly increased in patients positive for the mutated nudix hydrolase 15 
(NUDT15)R139 C variant. This genetic factor is often observed in patients with ancestry across broad 
areas of Asia, including Japanese, Korean and Chinese populations. Based on data derived from the 
published literature, the PRAC considered that there is currently sufficient available evidence to update 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC to include a new warning on the increased risk of severe toxicity in 
patients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene treated with 6-mercaptopurine. There is currently no data 
available to support mandating physicians to initiate genetic testing prior to use of the product. However, 
the PRAC agreed to include a statement that genotypic testing of NUDT15 prior to initiating treatment 
may be considered. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing mercaptopurine were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mercaptopurine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing mercaptopurine is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

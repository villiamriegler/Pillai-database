2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prucalopride (Resolor) belongs to a chemical class of dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide-derivatives with 
potent enterokinetic activity. It is one of a new generation of selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor 
agonists, the latter is likely to explain its enterokinetic effects. Serotonin (5-HT) signalling in the GI tract 
is known to regulate a range of functions including motility. Prucalopride increases colon motility and 
restores the natural movements of the bowels in a dose dependent matter, thus increasing the frequency 
and magnitude of bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation 
Resolor (prucalopride) is a film-coated tablet approved for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation 
in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. The product was approved in EU in October 
2009.  
At the time of the first marketing authorization, the efficacy of prucalopride was demonstrated for the 
overall study population (consisting of both male and female subjects) in 3 large Phase 3 studies in 
subjects with chronic constipation). However, the proportion of male subjects enrolled in these 3 studies 
was relatively low (12.2%), which is reflective of the relatively smaller number of male subjects who seek 
medical treatment forchronic constipation and participate in clinical studies for chronic constipation 
treatments. In the subgroup of male subjects in the prucalopride clinical studies mentioned above, the 
effect of prucalopride 2mg on the primary efficacy endpoint (≥3SCBMs/week over the 12-weektreatment 
period) was similar to placebo. This lack of difference in treatment effect was largely due to the presence

Page 5/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of more severe constipation at baseline in the subgroup of male subjects randomized to the prucalopride 
2mg group. Therefore at the time for the approval, data to support the efficacy for use of prucalopride in 
men was not considered sufficiently shown and the product was therefore approved for use in women 
only. The application was approved on the basis the MAH made a post-authorisation commitment to 
submit controlled study data to demonstrate efficacy in male patients (study SPD555-302). 
Study SPD555-302 has been finalized and the data is submitted in support of the present application 
concerning an extension of the indication to include the male population. The proposed wording for the 
additional indication is as follows: “Resolor is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation 
in women adults in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief.” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In 2011, within one of the post authorisation measures (FUM 001) the applicant provided a post-approval 
Phase II, Tier A Environmental Risk Assessment to CHMP. This ERA included men, women and children in 
the calculated population and is summarized below. In addition, a Phase II Tier B study in 
sediment-dwelling organisms was completed and submitted. 
The following Tier A studies were required:  
•  Adsorption/desorption of [14C]prucalopride succinate on 3 soils and 2 sludges (OECD 106) Algal 
growth inhibition test (OECD 201) 
• 
• 
Toxicity of prucalopride succinate to activated sludge in respiration inhibition test (OECD 209) 
Toxic effects to zebra Fish (Brachydanio rerio) in an early-life stage toxicity test (OECD 210) 
•  Effect of prucalopride succinate on survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna in a semi-static 
test over three weeks (OECD 211) 
•  Route and rate of degradation of [14C]prucalopride succinate in aerobic aquatic sediment 
systems (OECD 308)

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Information on absorption, metabolism, and excretion provided in the original MAA was based on a study 
including only 3 male subjects with poor excretion balance recovery in 2 of the subjects (PRU-BEL-16). 
Moreover, although the majority of prucalopride was found to be excreted unchanged, approximately 
30% of the dose was eliminated as multiple metabolites which were not well quantified. Therefore, a 
repeat absorption, metabolism, and excretion study of [14C] prucalopride succinate was conducted 
(Study SPD555-104). 
Study SPD555-104 
Objectives and methods: The aim of this open-label, non-randomized AME study of radiolabeled 
prucalopride succinate in 6 healthy male subjects were to: 
•  Determine the total radioactivity in whole blood and plasma after a single oral 2mg dose of [14C] 
prucalopride succinate,  
•  Determine the total radioactivity in urine and stool after a single oral 2mg dose of[14C] 
prucalopride succinate,  
•  Characterize, identify, and quantify metabolites of [14C] prucalopride succinate in plasma, urine, 
and stool as applicable  
•  Assess the pharmacokinetics of a single oral 2mg dose of [14C] prucalopride succinate. 
A total of 6 male subjects were included and all 6 subjects completed the study. Four subjects were of 
Black or African American origin and 2 subjects were White. The mean (SD) age was 35.5 (10.45 years). 
Blood samples of for pharmacokinetic and [14C] radioactivity were drawn on Day 1 (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 
3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post-dose), Day 2 (24 hours post-dose), Day 3 (48 hours post-dose), Day 4 (72 
hours post-dose), Day 5 (96 hours post-dose), Day 6 (120 hours post-dose), Day 7 (144 hours 
post-dose), Day 8 (168 hours post-dose), Day 9 (192 hours post-dose), Day 10 (216 hours post-dose), 
and Day 11 (240 hours post-dose). 
Urine collections for pharmacokinetic, [14C] radioactivity, and metabolite profiling and identification 
determinations were collected pre-dose on Day 1 (pre-dose urine samples including the subject’s urine 
output from waking until just prior to dosing [-2 to 0 hours]) and following the pre-dose urine void, 
complete urine output was collected over a 240-hour period. 
Stool samples for [14C] radioactivity and metabolite profiling and identification determinations were 
collected prior to and after dosing on Day 1. Pre-dose samples were collected starting from the time 
subjects entered the clinic on Day -1 until just prior to dosing. If multiple samples were provided for the 
pre-dose sample, only the sample closest to the scheduled dose administration was processed. Following 
dose administration on Day 1, complete stool output was collected over a 240-hour period. 
Plasma and urine concentrations were measured using the most current validated LC-MS/MS method.  
All collected samples were analyzed by LSC and/or AMS to determine the 14C-content, in plasma, whole 
blood, urine and freeze-dried feces. Based on these results, pooling schemes were devised and pooled 
plasma and feces samples underwent solvent extraction prior to HPLC analysis. Pooled urine was injected 
directly onto HPLC. Samples were pooled across time points and across subjects if variability in 
pharmacokinetic endpoints was low. This allowed individual metabolites in the excreta and plasma to be 
profiled and quantified. The HPLC eluate was collected using a fraction collector, the fractions analyzed by 
AMS and the AMS results plotted against HPLC retention time to generate metabolite profiles.

Results:  
Urinary excretion was the primary elimination route of total radioactivity with a mean of 84.2% of the 
radiolabeled dose recovered in urine through the last collection interval. A mean of 13.3% was recovered 
in feces. More than half of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the first 48 hours post-dose 
(61%). The overall mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces samples was 97.5% over the 
240-hour study, with recovery in individual subjects ranging from 86.9% to 109.7%. Plasma 
concentrations of prucalopride declined in a generally biphasic manner with an arithmetic mean t½ of 
20.6 hour and individual t½ estimates ranging 15.7-27.7 hours.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters based on plasma concentrations of prucalopride and total radioactivity 
in blood and plasma respectively are presented in Table 1.

Unchanged prucalopride was the largest component in plasma, urine, and feces, representing a mean of 
87.4% (70.2-93.2%) of the total radioactivity AUC0-24 in plasma and 65.0 and 5.1% of the administered

dose in urine and feces, respectively. The metabolites identified were products of N-dealkylation 
(R084536; N-desalkyl prucalopride), O-demethylation (R104065, O-desmethyl prucalopride), and 
subsequent oxidation (R107504, O-desmethyl prucalopride acid), direct glucuronidation (MS543, 
prucalopride N-glucuronide), and oxidation (MS383A, hydroxy prucalopride; MS383B, prucalopride 
N-oxide; and MS383C, prucalopride hydroxylamine). The radiolabeled metabolites of prucalopride 
observed in plasma each represented a mean total 2.2% or less of the total radioactivity AUC0-24. 
Metabolites detected and identified in excreta individually represented between 0.2-3.2% and 0.1-3.1% 
of the dose in urine and feces, respectively.  
Figure 2 Metabolic Pathways for prucalopride 
There were no serious adverse effects associated with treatment in this study and no treatment emergent 
adverse effects (TEAE) led to the discontinuation of the investigational product. Overall, 4 subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. Three subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE that the investigator considered 
related to the investigational product.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Prucalopride acts as a specific and selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist. The 5-HT4 receptor stimulation 
induces facilitation of cholinergic as well as non-cholinergic excitatory neurotransmission. This 
mechanism has been proposed to explain the enterokinetic effects of prucalopride.  
The MAH did not provide new information comparing the prucalopride pharmacodynamic profile between 
men and women, was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
During the procedure the applicant submitted Study STD555-403 which is shortly described below to 
support the following insertion into 5.1 of the SmPC:

“These pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride have been confirmed in human subjects with chronic 
constipation using manometry in an open-label, randomised, crossover, reader-blinded study 
investigating the effect of prucalopride 2mg and an osmotic laxative on colon motility as determined by 
the number of colonic high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs, also known as giant migrating 
contractions). Compared with a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, prokinetic 
stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of HAPCs during the 
first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product.” 
Study design & Objectives 
Study STD555-403 was an open-label, randomized, crossover, reader-blinded study which investigated 
the effect of prucalopride and polyethylene Glycol 3350 on colon motility with Intraluminal Manometry in 
12 subjects with chronic constipation.  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate differences in pharmacodynamic effects of 
prucalopride and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 + electrolytes on the number of colonic high amplitude 
propagating contractions (HAPCs) during a 12-hour colonic multisensory intraluminal manometry in 
chronically constipated subjects. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the association between motility parameters and number and consistency of bowel 
movements (BMs) in chronically constipated subjects receiving a single dose of prucalopride and 
2 doses of PEG 3350 + electrolytes 
To explore the relationship between plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic endpoints in 
chronically constipated subjects 
To collect pharmacogenomic data in chronically constipated subjects for exploratory purposes. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Blood samples for measurement of plasma concentrations of prucalopride were collected at 2, 2.5, and 
3 hours after the intake of investigational product. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
During the afternoon of Day -1 of each treatment period, subjects underwent placement of the colonic 
multiple sensor manometry catheter. The catheter contained 40 sensors (also known as channels), 
spaced 2.5cm apart. The manometry recordings began on Day 1, 1 hour prior to intake of investigational 
product and continued for 12 hours after the intake of investigational product until the catheter was 
removed. 
Statistical Methods: 
Pharmacodynamics: 
The manometry recordings (tracings) were read by an experienced gastroenterologist who was blinded to 
the treatment each subject received. The tracings were analyzed using computer-based validated 
software. High amplitude propagation contractions and manometry data was available for every sensor 
as well as average values for each HAPC and manometry time point. 
All analyses of HAPC data were performed using 3 thresholds: 
•  Mean amplitude ≥ 100mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm (9 sensors) 
•  Mean amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm (9 sensors) 
•  Mean amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 10cm (5 sensors).

The 100mmHg threshold formed the main analysis for each of the relevant HAPC endpoints as this 
threshold has been used in several previous studies in non-constipated subjects. Because it was not 
known if subjects with chronic constipation would reach peaks of 100mmHg, the analysis was also done 
at the 75mmHg threshold for 2 extensions (10 and 20cm) as sensitivity analyses. 
The primary pharmacodynamic variable was the number of HAPCs during the first 12 hours after 
treatment initiation. The secondary pharmacodynamic HAPC-associated variables included but were not 
limited to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The area under the curve (AUC) of all HAPCs (mmHg.sec) during the first 12 hours after 
treatment initiation 
The overall “force” of all HAPCs (mmHg.sec.cm) during the first 12 hours after treatment 
initiation 
The mean “force” (mmHg.sec.cm), mean amplitude (mmHg), mean extension (cm), mean 
duration (sec) and mean propagation velocity (cm/sec) of all HAPCs 
Time to first HAPC after administration of investigational product. 
Descriptive statistics were generated for each treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time data for prucalopride. 
All calculations were based on actual sampling times. The pharmacokinetic parameters determined were: 
•  Cmax: Maximum concentration occurring at tmax 
• 
tmax: Time of maximum observed concentration sampled during a dosing interval. 
Summary statistics were generated by treatment for each pharmacokinetic parameter and for 
prucalopride plasma concentrations at each of the sampling times. 
Results: 
Pharmacodynamic Results: 
Prucalopride treatment resulted in a statistically significantly higher mean number of HAPCs with 
amplitude ≥ 100mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm over the first 12 hours after dosing compared with PEG 
3350 (least square [LS][ means 8.7 vs 2.9, respectively; difference in LS means [95% confidence interval 
[CI]]: 5.8 [1.6; 9.9]; p=0.012). This result was corroborated by data from both sensitivity analyses. 
In addition, for all 3 HAPC thresholds, numerically more subjects experienced HAPCs on prucalopride than 
on PEG 3350: 
•  Nine subjects compared with 6 subjects had HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 100mmHg and extension ≥
20cm 
•  Nine subjects compared with 7 subjects had HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥
• 
20cm 
Twelve subjects compared with 9 subjects had HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension 
≥ 10cm). 
Specific HAPC characteristics (i.e., AUC, amplitude, overall force, mean force, mean extension, and mean 
duration) were higher in the prucalopride treatment group at all 3 thresholds. Differences were nominally 
statistically significant for HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm (mean extension) and 
amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 10cm (AUC, amplitude, overall force, and mean force) only. Mean 
propagation velocity was higher in the PEG 3350 treatment group at all 3 thresholds. 
After administration of investigational product, the median time to first HAPC with amplitude ≥ 100mmHg 
and extension ≥ 20cm was 4.5 hours with prucalopride treatment. The median time to first HAPC with 
amplitude ≥ 100mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm with PEG 3350 treatment could not be calculated as only 6

subjects had HAPCs that met this threshold. The median time to first HAPC with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and 
extension ≥ 20cm was similar with prucalopride (4.5 hours) and PEG 3350 treatment (4.8 hours). The 
median time to first HAPC with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 10cm was 1.2 hours with 
prucalopride treatment compared with 4.7 hours with PEG 3350 treatment. 
Pharmacokinetic Results: 
There was no correlation between the tmax and the time to first HAPC after administration of 
investigational product (tHAPC) (p>0.05 for all 3 thresholds). The first HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 100mmHg 
and extension ≥ 20cm and amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm occurred approximately 3.5 
hours after the tmax, which may indicate that prucalopride acts systemically (i.e., after prucalopride has 
been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the systemic circulation) rather 
than locally. The first HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and extension ≥ 10cm occurred around the tmax. 
Safety results: 
Prucalopride was generally well tolerated. Overall, 3 subjects (23.1%) experienced treatment-emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) during prucalopride treatment; none of the subjects experienced a TEAE during PEG 3350 
treatment. All TEAEs (gastrointestinal disorders and headache) were known adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) associated with the use of prucalopride. There were no fatal TEAEs, no other serious TEAEs, and 
no TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Clinical laboratory data and other safety parameters during prucalopride treatment were comparable with 
PEG 3350. No new safety signals were identified. 
Summary of the study findings 
•  Compared with PEG 3350, a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, prokinetic 
stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of HAPCs 
during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. 
•  Overall, HAPC characteristics (AUC, force, amplitude, extension, and duration) indicated that 
induced HAPCs were generally stronger with prucalopride compared with PEG 3350, except mean 
propagation velocity. 
• 
There was no correlation between the tmax and the tHAPC (p>0.05 for all 3 thresholds). The first 
HAPCs with amplitude ≥ 100mmHg and extension ≥ 20cm and amplitude ≥ 75mmHg and 
extension ≥ 20cm occurred approximately 3.5 hours after the tmax, which may indicate that 
prucalopride acts systemically rather than locally. 
•  Clinical laboratory data and other safety parameters during prucalopride treatment were 
comparable with PEG 3350. No new safety signals were identified. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed and Cmax is reached within 2-3 hours. The majority of the dose is 
eliminated unchanged in urine. The terminal half-life is about one day and steady-state is reached within 
three to four days.  
The population pharmacokinetic evaluation submitted with the initial MAA (2008) did not suggest a 
significant difference between men and women (7% out of the 1343 subjects included in the analysis 
were male). No pharmacokinetic data was obtained in the efficacy study in male patients (SPD555-302) 
included in the current submission. However, the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride are not expected to 
differ between male and female patients. Further supporting data on the previous findings regarding the 
route of elimination comes from the newly submitted pharmacokinetic study, SPD555-104. The 
bioanalytical methods appear to have been adequately validated, with bias <5% and CV<4% for QC

samples. A number of minor metabolites were identified, however none contributed more than ~2% to 
total radioactivity in plasma. No new safety signals were identified. 
At the request of the CHMP the sentence in section 4.5 of the SmPC “Although 8 different metabolites are 
known, the most abundant of these, the carboxylic acid product of side-chain oxidative O-demethylation, 
represents less than 4% of the dose.” was deleted as it was considered not to contribute important 
information not reflected already in 5.2 which has been updated with the new information from the 
pharmacokinetic study. 
Study STD555-403 demonstrated the gastrointestinal prokinetic activities of prucalopride. When 
compared with PEG 3350, the prokinetic stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as 
measured by the number of HAPCs during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. In 
the absence of stools data evaluation, the clinical significance or benefit of this mechanism of action when 
compared with osmotic effects of PEG 3350 could not be ascertained as neither stools consistency nor the 
frequency of bowel movement was evaluated. This was added to 5.1 of the SmPC together with the 
description of the study. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of the product in male patients is considered sufficiently characterised.

Title of Study 
Study No. SPD 555-302: A 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the 
efficacy, quality of life, safety and tolerability of prucalopride in male subjects with chronic constipation. 
Methods 
Study SPD555-302 was conducted between September 2007 and October 2013 in Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom. 
The study was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. 
The study commenced with a run-in period of 2-4 weeks depending on the subjects medication (agents 
influencing bowel habits) and need to rule out organic diseases. Patients were randomized to placebo or 
prucalopride (1:1) and were treated for 12 weeks. The randomization was stratified by country and the 
numbers of CBM during the drug-free run-in period (0 CBM or > 0 CBM per week).

For an overview of the study design, please see Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Overview of study design 
During the run-in phase subjects recorded their bowel habits and any rescue medication used to confirm 
the existence of constipation. Organic disorders as a cause of constipation were ruled out using the results 
of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. The run-in phase included physical examination, medical history, 
recording of concomitant therapies, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG). The 
patients were eligible for the 12-week double-blind treatment phase (Weeks 0 through 12) if their diary 
data during run-in confirmed that they met the entry criteria for chronic constipation. Patients who did not 
meet the criteria were considered ineligible and were discontinued from the study. 
During the double-blind period visits were scheduled for every second week. At each visit, the patients 
provided global assessments of their constipation severity and the therapeutic effect of study medication 
on 5-point Likert scales and completed a Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms questionnaire 
(PAC-SYM) regarding specific symptoms of constipation. The patients also completed the health-related 
QOL questionnaire, the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QOL). 
Safety and tolerability, including recording of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical 
examination including body weight, and ECG, were assessed at scheduled visits during the treatment 
period. 
Study participants 
Major inclusion criteria were: 
1.  Male outpatient ≥18 years of age with chronic constipation 
2.  The subject had a history of constipation. The subject reported an average of ≤2 SBMs/week 
that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation (SCBM) and 1 or more of the following for at 
least 6 months before the selection visit: 
 
 
 
very hard and/or hard stools for at least a quarter of the stools 
sensation of incomplete evacuation following for at least a quarter of the stools 
straining at defecation for at least a quarter of the time 
The exclusion criteria included the following: 
1.  subjects with drug-induced constipation 
2.  subjects using medication that were not approved 
3.  subjects suffering from secondary causes for constipation 
4.  subjects with a history of significant cancer (i.e. <5-year disease-free survival) 
5.  subjects with intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the 
gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn’s 
disease, and ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum 
6.  subjects with known serious illness

7.  subjects with impaired renal function 
Treatments 
Prucalopride was administered 2 mg once daily for subjects <65 years and for elderly it was 
recommended to start with 1 mg once daily and if needed the dose could be increased to 2 mg. The 
tablets, including matching placebo, was to be taken before breakfast.  
The effect of treatment was evaluated for elderly subjects at visits 3 and 4. If there was no response at 
one of these visits the subjects could increase the dosing to 2 mg. 
Rescue medication (bisacodyl) was provided by the Sponsor and could be used when a subject had not 
had a BM for ≥3 consecutive days. A maximum single dose of 15 mg (3 tablets) was accepted. In case of 
an insufficient response, the dose could be increased after consultation with the investigator. After 
unsuccessful use of bisacodyl tablets an enema could be used.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of prucalopride as compared with placebo 
for treatment of male subjects with chronic constipation. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, tolerability, impact of treatment on quality of life and 
on symptoms. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients (responders) with an average of ≥3 SCBM/week over 
the 12-week treatment period. 
The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of responders (weeks with ≥3 SCBM and an increase of 
≥1 SCBM compared to baseline) for ≥75% of the treatment period (≥9 out of 12 weeks) and for ≥75% 
of the last third of the treatment period (i.e., for ≥3 weeks over weeks 9-12). 
Further secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with an average increase over baseline of 
at least 1 SCBM per week, average score for stool consistency and straining during defecation, time to 
first SCBM after first dose of study medication, average number of bisacodyl tablets or enemas used per 
week, symptom-related data from the validated PAC-SYM questionnaire and the validated PACQOL 
questionnaire (satisfaction subscale score). 
Secondary endpoints were derived from the e-diaries. Both the primary and secondary endpoints were 
evaluated over 12 weeks, over 4-week periods and for single treatment weeks. 
Sample size 
Based on data on males participating in the initial pivotal studies, the MAH estimated that 174 subjects 
would be sufficient to detect a difference of 14 % between placebo and prucalopride 2mg at a power of 
90%. 
Randomisation 
A central a central IWRS/IVRS was used for organization of the randomization. The system ensured an 
approximate balance between the treatment groups regarding the stratification factors, country and 
numbers of CBM during the run-in phase. 
Blinding (masking) 
A central randomization system was set up. Placebo tablets identical to the active tablets were provided.  
The system provided subjects with no response on 1 mg active or placebo treatment with the appropriate 
corresponding 2 mg tablets.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population if not stated 
otherwise. The mITT population was defined as all randomized subjects that received at least one dose of 
double-blind treatment and with no major GCP breaches. 
The last non-missing observation after baseline and within 1 day of receiving the last dose of 
investigational product was used as the subject’s final on-treatment assessment (FoTA) for visit-based 
parameters. 
Countries with <12 subjects in the mITT Population was pooled according to geographical region for 
analyses where country is a factor in the model.  
The primary hypothesis of a difference between the placebo and prucalopride treatment group was 
investigated using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for general association, controlling for the 
randomization stratification factors (number of CBMs/week during Run-in [0 or >0 CBM] and country). 
Missing data for the primary endpoint and all other BM-related e-diary endpoints where handled in the 
following way: 
•  Subjects with <14 days of e-diary data were assumed to be non-responders and no further 
imputation was performed. 
• 
For subjects with ≥7 non-missing e-diary days after the first week of treatment but with <84 days 
of e-diary data, the information from the last 7 non-missing e-diary days was compressed into a 
block of 7 days and was repeatedly copied to all missing days after the last available e-diary day 
up to Day 84. Days beyond Day 84 because of carrying data forward were dropped. 
This rule for missing e-diary data was being implemented so that results from this study could be 
compared to previous studies in which similar analyses were performed. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary results to assess the robustness of data; generalized 
linear mixed model for repeated measures (direct likelihood technique) based on the proportion of 
subjects who were responders at each week, multiple imputation and logistic regression (for subjects with 
missing values, the estimates for the missing values were based on the treatment group to which that 
subject belonged), and Completers and Per-Protocol Populations analyses. 
The per-protocol included only patients that were compliant with the protocol to a defined extent. The 
completers population excluded patients that did not fulfil the study (early withdrawal or study 
duration<82 days).

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted at 66 sites distributed in 10 countries. 
There were two protocol amendments, the first in March 2010 and the second in June 2011. The most 
significant change in the first amendment was to add colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at the screening visit 
and to prolong the study period in order to allow for a possible longer run-in period. The second 
amendment of the protocol concerned mainly clarification of the protocol for investigators. Further, the 
time period when rescue medication was not allowed before the start of the double-blind treatment, was 
changed from 48 hours to 24 hours. 
Baseline data

Baseline disease characteristics are shown in Table 4. 
Table 4. Baseline disease characteristics (Safety population) 
The most commonly reported concomitant medical conditions were hypertension, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidaemia. There were 77 % and 78 % of patients reporting 
concomitant medical conditions in the active and placebo groups, respectively. 
The most commonly reported prior (during the run-in period) concomitant medications were 
acetylsalicylic acid and simvastatin. The total number of subjects using prior medication was 121 (65.8%) 
and 127 (68.3%) in the prucalopride and placebo treatment groups, respectively. During the double-blind 
period corresponding figures were 123 (66.8%) and 136 (73.1%) and the most commonly used 
medications were acetylsalicylic acid and simvastatin. 
Prior and concomitant medications 
Prior to the study, there were 121 (66 %) and 127 (68 %) of the subjects that took medication in the 
active and placebo groups, respectively. The corresponding figures for concomitant use was 123 (67 %) 
and 136 (73 %).  
The most commonly used prior and concomitant medications were acetylsalicylic acid and simvastatin.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 374 patients were randomized, 370 received medication and twelve patients were excluded due 
to GCP breach. The mITT population was used for the primary efficacy analysis. The PP population 
(excluding patients who discontinued the study drug before day 28 or met the predefined violation 
criteria) was used for sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint.  
Compliance was measured by the subject’s recordings in the e-diary and the amount of returned tablets 
recorded in the eCRF. Based on the e-diary, mean (SD) compliance was 94.40 (13.352) % in the 
prucalopride treatment group and 94.54 (12.991) % in the placebo treatment group. 
There were 63 subjects identified with at least one protocol deviation. The most commonly reported 
deviations concerned missing efficacy assessments (5.4% vs 3.8% in the prucalopride and placebo group 
respectively), deviations of inclusion criteria (4.3% vs. 4.8%) and intake of prohibited medication (3.8% 
vs. 3.2%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of responders is shown in Table 5. Results are presented for placebo treated subjects and 
prucalopride overall treatment i.e. 2 mg, 1 mg switching to 2 mg and 1 mg treatment groups. 
Table 5. Proportion of subjects with an average weekly fequency of ≥ 3 SCBMs over the 
12-week treatment Period (mITT) 
Result of secondary analyses of the primary endpoint show that for the three 4-week periods, there were 
statistically significant differences between the active and placebo treatment and also for all individual 
weeks apart from week 10. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The result of the key secondary endpoint is shown in Table 6.

an increase of ≥1 SCBM weekly for ≥ 75% of the 12-week treatment period and ≥ 75% of the 
last third of the 12-week treatment period (mITT) 
Number of weeks with response 
In the prucalopride treatment group, subjects were considered responders for a mean (SD) of 4.6 (4.52) 
weeks, compared with 3.1 (3.81) weeks for subjects in the placebo treatment group.

12-week double-blind treatment period (mITT)) 
Stool Consistency 
The mean (SD) proportion of subjects with normal stool consistency during the run-in period was 28% 
(33.8) in the prucalopride group and 32% (33.4) in the placebo group. There was an increase of the 
proportion over the 12 weeks of approximately 18% (mean) in both groups. The proportion of subjects 
with hard stools decreased during the study period corresponding to a mean of 29% and 19% in the 
active and placebo group, respectively. 
Straining during defecation 
There was a mean increase in the proportion of subjects with no straining during the period of 
approximately 5% in both groups, while the mean proportion of subjects with severe or very severe 
straining decreased to a mean of 25% in the prucalopride group and 16% in the placebo group. 
Time to first SCBM after first dose of study medication 
From the intake of investigational product on Day 1, the median (95% CI) time to first SCBM was 110 
[70.8; 172.8] hours in the prucalopride treatment group compared with 219 [143.9; 291.4] hours in the 
placebo treatment group (logrank p-value=0.0090). The median (95% CI) time to first SBM was 10 [8.1; 
20.9] hours compared with 28 [25.8; 33.0].  
Rescue medication 
During the double-blind treatment period, a total of 68 subjects (40.0%) in the prucalopride treatment 
group and 96 subjects (55.8%) in the placebo treatment group used at least 1 tablet of bisacodyl. Ten 
subjects in each of the groups used at least one enema during the same period. Fifty-nine % of subjects 
in the prucalopride group and 43 % in the placebo group used no rescue medication.  
Patient Global Assessment 
At baseline, the proportion of subjects rating their constipation as severe or very severe was 67.6% in the 
prucalopride treatment group and 56.2% in the placebo treatment group. At the FoTA (final on-treatment 
assessment), the proportion was 21.9% in the prucalopride treatment group and 30.4% in the placebo 
treatment group. 
The proportion of subjects rating their constipation treatment as “quite a bit” to “extremely“ effective at 
the FoTA was 46.7% and 30.4% in the prucalopride and placebo treatment groups, respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The MAH has presented pooled data from 6 phase 3/4 efficacy and safety studies in chronic constipation 
(Studies SPD555-302, PRU-CRC-3001, SPD555-401, PRU-INT-6, PRU-USA-11, and PRU-USA-13). The 
proportion of subjects with ≥3 SCBMs over the 12 week period was analyzed for females and males, 
respectively, see Table 9.

Movements per Week Over 12 Weeks – Key Phase 3/4 Efficacy and Safety Studies in Chronic 
Constipation (Male versus Female Subjects; Full Analysis Set) 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has submitted the results of a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled study in support of a 
proposed new indication to include the male population. The pivotal studies submitted in support of the 
initial application were mainly conducted in caucasian women. Due to the low numbers of men included 
and that the efficacy in the male subpopulation was not statistically different from that of placebo, the 
efficacy in men was not considered sufficiently evaluated at that time.

Subjects included in the present pivotal study for the male population suffered from chronic idiopathic 
constipation. Chronic constipation was defined as 2 or fewer SBMs (spontaneous bowel movements) per 
week in the previous 6 months and, in addition, very hard (little balls) or hard stools and/or a sensation 
of incomplete evacuation and/or straining during defecation, in relation with at least a quarter of the 
stools. Although the inclusion criteria used to ensure that patients suffered from functional constipation 
are not fully in congruence with the present Rome Working Group definition for chronic constipation (III), 
the criteria used are in accordance with those for the population studied in the previous pivotal studies in 
the initial application and are therefore endorsed.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients that achieved a mean of ≥3 SCBMs 
(spontaneous complete bowel movements) per week over the 12 weeks of the study. The primary 
endpoint is supported since it includes both the frequency of bowel movements and the sensation of relief 
(completeness) and it was also used as the primary endpoint in the initial pivotal studies. The key 
secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with an average weekly frequency of ≥3 SCBM per 
week and an increase of ≥1 SCBM weekly for ≥75% of the 12-week treatment period and ≥75% of the 
last third of the 12-week treatment period.  
Further secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with an average increase over baseline of 
at least 1 SCBM per week, average score for stool consistency and straining during defecation, time to 
first SCBM after first dose of study medication, average number of bisacodyl tablets or enemas used per 
week, symptom-related data from the validated PAC-SYM questionnaire and the validated PACQOL 
questionnaire (satisfaction subscale score). 
The results of the primary efficacy endpoint show a difference between active and placebo treatment of 
20% units. This result compares well with that of the pooled analysis of the pivotal studies in the primary 
application that showed a difference of 12-14 %. The result is supported by the key secondary endpoint 
(difference 15%), although this endpoint is correlated with the primary endpoint and therefore does not 
contribute to the results to any larger extent. The outcome of some of the remaining secondary endpoints 
was also supportive.  
All secondary variables were tested on the 5% significance level with no correction for multiplicity. Hence 
the p-values should be interpreted with care. 
There were two protocol amendments. The first amendment did not compromise the design of the study 
since there were no patients included at that point. The introduction of the second amendment is not 
likely to have compromised the results since it concerned the timing of the use of rescue medication prior 
to the first dose of double-blind treatment only and the primary efficacy variable was measured over the 
whole 12-week period. 
There were more subjects in the active treatment group that were >65 years than in the placebo group 
(43% vs. 38%). There were also more subjects in the active treatment group with an average weekly 
frequency of SBMs ≤1 and with a main complaint concerning ‘feeling of not completely emptying the 
bowels’. The potential influence of these differences on the results is not expected to be of any major 
relevance and a potential influence would not favour the active treatment group, at least not the primary 
variable, since this endpoint is based on absolute numbers and not differences from baseline. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The result of the primary efficacy endpoint show a percentage difference between the placebo and active 
treatment groups of approximately 20% (p<0.0001) with no major differences between the ITT and the 
PP population.  
For the key secondary endpoint, there is a statistically significant difference between active treatment 
and placebo. Although the numbers of subjects fulfilling the criteria is limited and the clinical relevance is 
Assessment report  
EMA/363746/2015  
Page 26/38 
 
 
 
 
 
hard to appreciate, the data are supportive of the primary efficacy endpoint. However, this endpoint is 
strongly correlated to the primary variable and therefore does not contribute to the results to any larger 
extent. 
The result presented from the present study for the primary endpoint suggests that the treatment effect 
is of clinical relevance as well as being statistically significant in the male population 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pooled analyses of the primary endpoint (weeks 1-12) from the pivotal studies submitted with the 
original MAA, the percentage difference between placebo and active treatment was approximately 
12%-14% units (included both female and male subjects). In the subgroup of male subjects the 
difference between the 2 mg treatment group and placebo was not statistically significant. The lack of 
statistical significance was explained by the low number of men in the studies and that a higher proportion 
of men had severe constipation. 
Now data has been presented showing that prucalopride has a clinically relevant effect on chronic 
constipation in the male population. The primary endpoint of the study was met and a statistically 
significantly higher percentage of subjects in the Resolor group (37.9%) had an average of ≥3 
SCBMs/week compared with subjects in the placebo treatment group (17.7%) (p<0.0001) over the 
12-week double-blind treatment period. 
The key secondary endpoints reach statistical significance. Additional endpoints were supportive, without 
reaching statistical significance. 
Based on the results from the primary endpoint and supportive secondary endpoints, the CHMP 
considered that prucalopride has an clinically relevant effect on the motility of the bowel also in men.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In support of the application for an extension of the indication for prucalopride in the treatment of chronic 
constipation in men, the results of the pivotal study, study SPD555-302, has been submitted. The MAH 
has further presented an integrated safety analysis of key Phase 3/4 efficacy and safety studies in chronic 
constipation including subjects from Studies SPD555-302, PRU-CRC-3001, SPD555-401, PRU-INT-6, 
PRU-USA-11, and PRU-USA-13 (Summary of Clinical Safety). 
Data from the integrated analysis include 1279 subjects that received placebo and 1273 subjects received 
prucalopride ≤2mg. Data from subjects that received the high dose of 4 mg prucalopride in the previous 
studies was not discussed since this dose is not approved, although the results contributed to the overall 
population results.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events are shown in Table 14. 
Table 14. Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
None of the serious TEAEs were considered related to the investigational drug. There were no deaths in 
any of the studies included in the integrated analysis. 
Laboratory findings 
Mean changes from baseline in biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters were reviewed to 
detect changes over time. Mean changes were generally small and none were considered clinically 
relevant. There were changes in creatine kinase in the prucalopride group during the study. The change 
was attributed to one subject with an extreme value and was considered unrelated to the study drug. 
Prolactin levels (>3 ULN) were reported in 7 subjects at screening/baseline and at week 12 there were 
two subjects with elevated values (one in each the active and placebo group respectively). The most 
common shifts for biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters are shown in Table 15.

Table 15. Most Common (>5% in any Treatment Group) Shifts from Normal to Abnormal at 
the Final on-treatment Assessment (Safety Population) 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs related to clinical laboratory abnormalities was low and comparable 
between both treatment groups. Treatment-emergent AEs related to clinical laboratory abnormalities 
reported for ≥2 subjects in the prucalopride treatment group were haematuria, hyperbilirubinaemia, and 
thrombocytopenia reported for 3 subjects (1.6%), 2 subjects (1.1%), and 2 subjects (1.1%), 
respectively, compared with 2 subjects (1.1%), 0 subjects, and 0 subjects in the placebo treatment 
group. 
One subject in the prucalopride treatment group was reported to have hyperprolactinaemia. This TEAE 
was reported after the Week 4 laboratory assessment, which showed a prolactin level of 797mIU/L 
(normal ranges: 85-322mIU/L). The subject’s prolactin levels at baseline and Week 12 (195 and 
248mIU/L, respectively) were normal. The investigator considered the TEAE to be mild and unrelated to 
the investigational product. No concomitant therapy was reported. All TEAEs related to laboratory 
abnormalities were mild or moderate in severity, none were considered serious, and none led to the 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Vital signs abnormalities were reported as TEAE in 5 subjects: 2 subjects (1.1%) in the prucalopride 
treatment group had hypotension, 1 subject (0.5%) in both the prucalopride and placebo treatment 
group had hypertension, and 1 subject (0.5%) in the placebo treatment group had blood pressure 
increased. Apart from the case of blood pressure increased, which led to the discontinuation of treatment, 
all TEAEs related to vital sign abnormalities were non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not 
result in discontinuation of investigational product. 
Mean changes from baseline in ECG parameters were reviewed to detect changes over time. Mean 
changes were generally small and none were considered clinically relevant. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were 6 subjects in the prucalopride group (3.3%) and 7 (3.8%) in the placebo treatment group that 
discontinued due to TEAEs. All TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity and were dominated by 
gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders. 
Post marketing experience 
Resolor is approved since 2009 and is currently approved for symptomatic treatment of chronic 
constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. The safety profile is well

characterised and the main adverse events are gastrointestinal symptoms and headache. Palpitation is an 
important identified risk. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
There were 42% of the patients in the prucalopride treatment group that reported AEs during the 
treatment compared with 34% in the placebo group.  
The most commonly reported AEs in the prucalopride group were gastrointestinal disorders (i.e. 
diarrhoea and nausea), and headache. In the placebo group, gastrointestinal disorders and infections and 
infestations were most commonly reported. The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. 
Data from the integrated analysis showed that the most commonly reported TEAEs for prucalopride 
treated patients were gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and headache. 
The most common differences in shifts in laboratory parameters between the two groups concerned high 
prolactin, low erythrocytes and high cholesterol values. Two patients, one in each treatment group had 
prolactin values >3 times the upper limit of normal (i.e. 3 times 322 mIU/L) at week 12. None of these 
events were reported as TEAEs. Exclusion of all prolactin levels >3 ULN (screening, baseline and week 12) 
showed comparable mean changes from baseline to week 4 and 12 in both treatment groups. Overall 
there were no major differences between the groups concerning shifts in vital signs, changes in 
electrocardiogram or physical examinations.  
The numbers of discontinuations due to TEAEs were of similar magnitude in both prucalopride and 
placebo treatment groups. 
Overall, the safety profile of prucalopride shown in current study is similar to that of the integrated 
database involving clinical trials submitted in the original application. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of prucalopride in the treatment of chronic constipation in men has been assessed in 
the study SPD555-302. Subjects were followed during 12-weeks of double-blind treatment. A total of 370 
men were included in the safety population of which 184 received treatment with prucalopride. The 
overall incidence of AEs was higher in patients treated with active substance as compared to placebo. 
There was a similar rate of discontinuations due to TEAEs in the two treatment groups. The most 
commonly reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (i.e. diarrhoea and nausea) and headache. This 
result is in line with data from integrated analysis submitted that includes safety data from the key phase 
3/4 studies for prucalopride. The numbers of serious adverse events was low. Changes in laboratory 
parameters, vital sign and ECG were in general modest and without any major clinical significance. All 
TEAEs related to laboratory abnormalities were mild or moderate in severity, none were considered 
serious, and none led to the discontinuation of treatment. 
The CHMP concluded that Prucalopride was generally well tolerated during study SPD555-302. The safety 
profile observed was consistent with previous clinical trials for prucalopride. No new safety 
concerns/signals have been identified.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, section 4.1 of the SmPC has been updated as follows: Resolor is 
indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in women adults in whom laxatives fail to 
provide adequate relief.  
Further, sections 4.2 and 4.4 have been updated and text regarding the lack of data on men has been 
deleted. The sentence in section 4.5: “Although 8 different metabolites are known, the most abundant of 
these, the carboxylic acid product of side-chain oxidative O-demethylation, represents less than 4% of 
the dose.” was deleted as it does not contribute important additional information.

Section 4.8 has been updated to include safety data from the pivotal study. In section 5.1 a description 
of the pivotal study as well as of the PK/PD study STC555-403 has been added. Furthermore SmPC 5.2 
has been updated with the new information from the pharmacokinetic study SPD555-104. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guidelines [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet (PL) has been performed. As the 
changes proposed in this variation are deemed not to be substantial, further readability testing is not 
considered to be required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Data from the single study presented show clinically relevant and statistically significant difference for the 
primary endpoint as compared with the effects seen in the placebo-treated group in the treatment of 
constipation in males. The difference between the active and placebo-treated group is 20% (p<0.0001) 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. This compares well with the primary results in the pivotal studies in the 
original application, 12-14 % units responder difference between active treatment and placebo (included 
both female and male subjects). 
The data showed that prucalopride has an effect on the frequency of bowel movements and on the 
patients’ sense of relief in men suffering from chronic constipation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
None 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There were 42% of the patients in the prucalopride treatment group that reported AEs during the 
treatment compared with 34% in the placebo group. The majority of AEs were gastrointestinal disorders 
(i.e. diarrhoea and nausea) and headache. The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate severity.  
The reported AEs in the study were in line with those observed in the previous pivotal studies. Further, the 
rate of discontinuations was similar in the two treatment groups.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is a risk of palpitations connected with the use of prucalopride. Palpitations are listed in the SmPC 
(section 4.8) and there is also a warning in section 4.4 stating that prucalopride should not be used in 
patients with severe and clinically unstable concomitant disease. This risk is also addressed in the RMP.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Based on the results from the primary endpoint and supportive secondary endpoints, it is considered that 
prucalopride has an effect on the motility of the bowel also in men. This effect is considered to be of 
clinical relevance.  
The most commonly reported adverse events associated with prucalopride treatment are headache and 
gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain). Serious adverse events have been 
rare. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Data has been presented showing that prucalopride has a clinically relevant effect on chronic constipation 
in the male population. No new safety signals have been identified. The safety profile of prucalopride 
remains unchanged. 
Thus, the benefit risk is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for a new indication to extend the indication into the 
male population based on data from study SPD555-302. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated 
in accordance. 
The MAH has also taken the opportunity to update some local representatives. 
A revised RMP version 12.0 was included as part of this application. 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Additional data exclusivity/market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

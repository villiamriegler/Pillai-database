SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II:  MODULE  SI  - EPIDEMIOLOGY  OF THE INDICATION(S)  AND  TARGET 
POPULATION(S) 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  is  caused  by  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome 
coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2),  a  newly  emergent  coronavirus.  Genetic  sequencing  of  the  virus 
suggests that it is a betacoronavirus closely linked to the SARS virus (WHO Interim Guidance 2020). 
On December 29, 2019, the first 4 cases reported and since then, an increasing number of cases of 
novel  coronavirus-infected  pneumonia  have  been  identified  in  Wuhan,  China.  The  virus  became 
widespread  throughout  other  Chinese  cities  more  than  a  dozen  countries  around  the  world  via 
suspected  human-to-human  transmission  (Li  2020a).  On  11  March  2020,  the  World  Health 
Organization  (WHO)  declared  that  the  COVID-19  can  be  characterized  as  a  pandemic  due  to 
alarming spread and severity of COVID-19 worldwide (WHO Speech, 2020). As of 23 May 2021, 
nearly 166.4 million-cases and over 3.4 million deaths have been reported globally (WHO COVID-
19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, 25 May 2021).  
Although a complete understanding of transmission has not been identified yet, there is evidence that 
transmission can occur through aerosol or fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus was 
found to remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days, depending on 
the inoculum shed (van Doremalen 2020). Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 are also potential sources of COVID-19 infection, though the mechanism by which 
asymptomatic  carriers  could acquire  and transmit SARS-CoV-2 requires further  study  (Bai 2020, 
Kimball 2020, Rothe 2020). Several studies provide evidence of both direct and indirect transmission 
of  SARS-CoV-2.  Santarpia  et  al,  collected  air  and  surface  samples  from  individuals  who  were 
infected  with  COVID-19.  Viral  contamination  was  detected  among  all  samples,  indicating  that 
SARS-CoV-2  may  spread  through  both  direct  (droplet  and  person-to  person)  as  well  as  indirect 
mechanisms (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) (Santarpia 2020). A similar study in 
China also implies aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Liu et al collected air samples from rooms, 
hallways  and  toilets  of  hospitals  located  in  Wuhan,  China  during  COVID-19  outbreak  and  the 
samples were mostly positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Liu 2020). In another study, SARS-CoV-2 remained 
viable in experimentally-induced aerosols for up to 3 hours (van Doremalen 2020). In order to protect 
public  health  from  COVID-19,  toilets  should  be  properly  used  and  cleaned  (e.g.  ventilation  and 
sterilization) as a toilet can be a potential source of COVID-19 with relatively high risk caused by 
aerosolization of the virus and contamination of surfaces after use. The general public should use 
personal protection measures such as performing hand hygiene, wearing masks and avoiding busy 
crowds.  Effective  sanitization  of  high  risk  areas  and  the  use  of  high  level  protection  masks  for 
medical staff is also important (Liu 2020, WHO Interim Guidance 2020). 
Genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 occur over time and those variations affect the characteristics of 
the virus. They have been emerging and circulating around the world. Some of genetic variations are 
classified as Variant of Concern (VOC) for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, 
more  severe  disease  (e.g.,   increased  hospitalizations  or  deaths),  significant  reduction  in 
neutralization  by  antibodies  generated  during  previous  infection  or  vaccination,  reduced 
effectiveness  of  treatments  or  vaccines,  or  diagnostic  detection  failures  (Variants  and  Genomic 
Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, CDC). Due to their characteristics, it is closely monitored by each 
regulatory authority, as well as WHO.  As of 25 May 2021, a total of 4 types of SARS-CoV-2 VOC

was  identified.  It  is  updated  on  vaccine  performance  against  VOCs  (WHO  COVID-19  Weekly 
Epidemiological Update, 25 May 2021). 
Incidence and Prevalence 
As of 23 May 2021, there were 166,352,007 cumulative cases reported worldwide, according to data 
as received by WHO from national authorities. Americas currently has the largest number of cases 
reported (65,980,739; 40%), followed by Europe (54,110,276; 33%), South-East Asia (30,088,649; 
18%),  Eastern  Mediterranean  (9,863,946;  6%),  Africa  (3,446,089;  2%)  and  Western  Pacific 
(2,861,544; 2%) (WHO COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, 25 May 2021). 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for the Disease 
Although all age groups are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in most cases patients were 30 to 
79 years old, with the median age ranging from 49 to 59 years. There were few cases in children 
below 15 years of age (He 2020, Yang 2020). Clinical findings in China showed that children (age 
below 15)  with COVID-19  usually  presented mild  respiratory infections,  as  compared  with  adult 
cases (Cai 2020). On another study in China, all paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) had mild to 
moderate type of COVID-19 (Qiu 2020). In the United States, most reported COVID-19 infection in 
children aged below 18 are asymptomatic or mild. Less is known about severe COVID-19 in children 
requiring hospitalization (U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020). 
More than half of patients are male. In China, the proportion of male patients ranged from 51% to 
58% of total reported cases (Guan 2020, WHO Report of WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 
2020), and was as high as 70% in some hospitals (Yang 2020, Zhou 2020). A higher proportion of 
fatal  outcomes  among  male  patients  compared  to  females  has  been  reported  in  China  and  the 
EU/EAA (Chen 2020, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020, Onder 
2020). However, males with COVID-19 may also be more likely to have acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) and patients with ARDS have a higher proportion of comorbid conditions such 
as hypertension and diabetes that resulted in less rigorous immune response (Wu 2020a).  
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Currently,  the  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  remdesivir  was  granted  conditional 
marketing authorisation by the EMA for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (aged 
12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen 
(Remdesivir EU RMP version 1.0). Remdesivir was also approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
adults and paediatric (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) COVID-19 patients 
requiring hospitalization (Veklury US Prescribing Information, 2020).  
Meanwhile,  in  addition  to  corticosteroid  dexamethasone,  there  was  advice  to  Member  states  on 
treatments  that  are  not  yet  authorized  specifically  for  patients  with  COVID-19:  bamlanivimab  / 
etesevimab,  casirivimab  /  imdevimab,  sotrovimab,  and  regdanvimab.  All  4  treatments  including 
regdanvimab, are designed to target RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and the data provided 
by each company might provide clinical benefit for the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 in adult 
patients (bamlanivimab and etesevimab assessment report, casirivimab and imdevimab assessment 
report,  sotrovimab  assessment  report,  regdanvimab  assessment  report).  They  are  currently  under 
rolling review for authorization.

Regdanvimab (CT-P59) 
CTD Module 1, Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan Version 0.8 
For patients with severe illness, a number of potential treatments, such as the nucleoside analogues 
ribavirin and favipiravir, the antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the protease 
inhibitor  lopinavir  and  ritonavir,  pegylated  interferon  alfa-2a  and  -2b,  have  been  used  clinically 
against  COVID-19  during  the  pandemic  (Li  2020b,  Lu  2020).  The  IL-6  receptor  antagonist 
tocilizumab was considered a possible candidate drug for managing the cytokine storm associated 
with COVID-19, with encouraging results observed in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 
patients in China (Ragab 2020). Clinical trials are being performed globally to assess efficacy and 
safety of the treatments and to develop novel vaccines and treatments. 
Two mRNA vaccines were approved by EMA to be used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-
CoV-2 virus. The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-
CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to 
the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19 (Comirnaty EPAR 2021, 
COVID-19  Vaccine  Moderna  CHMP  Opinion  2021).  In  addition,  two  vaccines  made  up  of 
adenovirus family were proved by EMA for preventing COVID-19 in people aged 18 years and older. 
They work by producing the spike protein and develop person’s immune system to recognise the 
spike protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells to target it (COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca CHMP Opinion 2021, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen CHMP Opinion 2021). 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition including Mortality and Morbidity 
Available information on the history and course of COVID-19 is described in an interim guidance 
document published by the World Health Organization. The onset of symptoms due to SARS-CoV-
2 infection appears following the incubation period, which is the time between exposure to the virus 
(becoming infected) and symptom onset, is, on average, 5–6 days, but can be up to 14 days. Most 
people  with  SARS-CoV-2  infection  develop  only  mild  (40%)  or  moderate  (40%)  disease  (WHO 
Interim Guidance 2020). 
Most  people  experience  fever  (83-99%),  cough  (59-82%),  fatigue  (44-70%),  anorexia  (40-84%), 
shortness  of  breath  (31-40%),  or  myalgia  (11-35%).  Other  non-specific  symptoms,  such  as  sore 
throat,  nasal  congestion,  headache,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting,  have  also  been  reported. 
Anosmia  or  ageusia  preceding  the  onset  of  respiratory  symptoms  has  also  been  reported.  Older 
people and immunosuppressed patients in particular may present with atypical symptoms such as 
fatigue, reduced alertness, reduced mobility, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and absence of fever. 
COVID-19  is  also  associated  with  mental  and  neurological  manifestations,  including  delirium  or 
encephalopathy, agitation, stroke, meningo-encephalitis, impaired sense of smell or taste, anxiety, 
depression, and sleep problems. In many cases, neurological manifestations have been reported even 
without respiratory symptoms. Case reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and meningo-encephalitis 
among people with COVID-19 have also been reported. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are 
generally milder in children compared with adults. Relatively few cases of infants confirmed with 
COVID-19  have  been  reported.  However,  most  recently,  a  multisystem  inflammatory  syndrome 
temporally associated with COVID-19 in children and adolescents has been described. 
Approximately  15%  develop  severe  disease  that  requires  oxygen  support,  and  5%  have  critical 
disease with  complications such as respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis 
and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including acute kidney injury, and 
cardiac  injury.  Older  age,  smoking  and  underlying  noncommunicable  diseases,  such  as  diabetes,

CTD Module 1, Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan Version 0.8 
hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer have been reported as risk factors for 
severe disease and death.  
Although  observed  on  small  patient  groups,  among  patients  transferred  to  the  intensive  care  unit 
(ICU), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most frequent complication. Results from 
study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China on January 
and February 2020, 36 patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of 
complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]). (Wang 2020). According 
to  systemic  literature  review  for  which  the  search  date  was  March  2020,  ARDS  was  the  most 
common  complication,  with  a  pooled  event  rate  of  18.4%  (95%  CI,  7.4  –  32.4%)  (Zhang  2020). 
Excessive  production  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  leads  to  ARDS  aggravation  and  widespread 
tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure and death (Ragab 2020). 
Mortality proportionately increases as patients  are older.  In an analysis of COVID-19 cases from 
early 2020 adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of cases, the age-specific case fatality 
ratios in China were estimated to be substantially higher in older age groups (0.32%, 6.4%, and 13.4% 
among those 60 years and younger, greater than 60 years old, and 80 years and older respectively). 
Estimates from  the  same  study  for international cases also  showed  the  same trend. (Verity 2020) 
Under  the  result  of  a  systemic  review  of  literature  conducted  until  April  2020,  advanced  age 
conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death (Figliozzi 2020). 
Important Co-morbidities 
Although severe symptoms due to COVID-19 can occur in individuals of any age without underlying 
conditions, a greater risk of hospitalization, severe disease and/or fatal outcome due to COVID-19 
has been documented among patients with the following co-morbidities: (Guan 2020, Huang 2020,

Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
Toxicity 
•  key issues identified from repeat-dose toxicity study 
Monkey (Cynomolgus Monkey):  
1. Three animals/sex/group, doses of CT-P59 at 0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg i.v. on Days 1 and 
8 (Study No.G220016) 
In  accordance  with  the  ICH  Safety  Guideline  S6(R1)  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of 
Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH 2011), a 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys was conducted.  
Administration of CT-P59 up to 400 mg/kg were generally well-tolerated. However, test item-
related changes of clinical pathology and macro and microscopic findings were observed in 
mostly one male  at 400 mg/kg (Animal no. 4M0002). In clinical pathology, increased CRP 
level,  decrease  of  A/G  ratio  and  increased  large  unstained  cell  counts  were  observed.  In 
microscopic examination, sinusoidal increased cell of the liver (including Animal no. 4M0001) 
and increased cellularity of the bone marrow were noted. These findings were considered test 
item-related but not adverse (Lewis, et al., 2002) since these were noted only in one male and 
they were not accompanied by degenerative changes. Moreover, there was thymic atrophy in 
the microscopic findings and this change was associated with the decreased size and weights 
of the thymus and considered to be secondary changes caused by body weight loss or stress 
(Everds,  et  al.,  2013;  Moriyama,  et  al.,  2008).  Decreased  ALB  was  also  considered  to  be 
secondary changes caused by decreased food consumption and body weight (Moriyama, et al., 
2008). Besides, decrease in RBC parameters, prolonged PT, macroscopic increased size and 
increased weights of the kidneys and liver were observed. These changes were considered not 
adverse,  but  it  was  unclear  whether  the  changes  were  related  to  the  test  item,  because  the 
changes were minimal and there were no microscopic correlates. 
In conclusion, there were no CT-P59 related toxicological changes in mortality, clinical signs, 
body  weights,  food  consumption,  ophthalmology,  electrocardiography,  haematology, 
coagulation, urinalysis, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic observations. 
2. Dose of CT-P59 at 0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg with once weekly, i.v. infusion for 3-weeks 
(total three doses; on Days 1, 8, and 15) with 10-week recovery period. (Study No.20251637) 
The study was conducted in accordance with following guidelines: Committee for Medicinal 
Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP),  ICH  Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  M3  (R2),  ICH 
Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  S3a,  ICH  Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  S6  (R1),  ICH 
Harmonised Tripartite Guideline S7A, and the Japanese Guidelines for Nonclinical Studies of 
Drugs  Manual  (1995).  Guidelines  for  Nonclinical  Pharmacokinetic  Studies,  Guidelines  for 
General Pharmacology Studies, and (Chapter 3, Repeated Dose Toxicity Studies). 
Administration of CT-P59 up to 400 mg/kg were clinically well-tolerated. All animals survived 
for the study duration and there were no CT-P59-related effects in the following parameters: 
clinical  observations,  food  consumption,  body  weights,  ophthalmology  examinations, 
electrocardiograms,  urinalysis  parameters,  organ  weights,  macroscopic  or  microscopic 
findings.

CTD Module 1, Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan Version 0.8 
Acute phase response 
CT-P59-related changes in hematology parameters were observed in some individual animals 
at all dose levels. Animals received CT-P59 (11 out of 22 Animals) had transient moderately 
to markedly decreased neutrophils associated with decreased white blood cell counts in some 
animals on Days 8, 15, and/or 22. Among them, three animals at 200 or 400 mg/kg/dose had 
mildly to markedly increased monocytes and/or lymphocytes on Days 8 and/or 15. Monocyte 
and lymphocyte values generally recovered by Day 22. CT-P59-related changes in coagulation 
and clinical chemistry parameters also consisted of an acute phase response for several males 
and  females  at  100  or  200  mg/kg/dose  that  included  minimally  to  markedly  increased 
fibrinogen,  C-reactive  protein,  and/or  globulins,  and  mildly  decreased  albumin  and 
albumin/globulin ratio on Days 8 and/or 15 with recovery on Day 22 except for globulins in 
two animals at 100 and 200 mg/kg/dose.  
Two animals administered the highest dose of CT-P59 (400 mg/kg/dose), had dose dependent 
changes in clinical pathology parameters that were either not present in other animals or were 
more pronounced compared to other animals dosed at 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/dose and are 
discussed separately in the paragraphs below.  
Hematology changes in one or both animals included transient moderate to marked decreases 
in neutrophils associated with decreased white blood cell counts. There was recovery of the 
white blood cell count by Day 22 for one animal. There were minimal to marked neutrophil 
Döhle  bodies  observed  during  blood  smear  evaluation  on  Day  15  or  22  suggestive  of 
accelerated maturation in the bone marrow. Monocytes were mildly decreased for one animal 
on Day 8 followed by a moderate increase on Day 22. Red blood cell mass (hemoglobin, red 
blood cell count, and hematocrit) was mildly to moderately decreased on Days 8, 15, and/or 
22. Reticulocytes were moderately decreased on Day 8 followed by mild to moderate increases 
on Days 15 and 22 for one animal or were not adequately increased on Day 22 for remaining 
animal.  Red  cell  distribution  width  was  moderately  increased,  and  along  with  increased 
reticulocytes for one animal, correlated with minimal to mild anisocytosis and polychromasia 
observed  during  blood  smear  evaluation  on  Days  15  and/or  22.  Platelets  were  transiently, 
mildly decreased with decreased plateletcrit and increased platelet distribution width on Day 8 
or  15  with  recovery  on  Day  15  or  22  except  for  platelet  distribution  width  for  one  animal. 
Changes in coagulation and clinical chemistry included minimally prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time for one animal on Day 8 only and an acute phase response consisting of 
minimally  to  markedly  increased  fibrinogen,  C-reactive  protein,  globulins,  triglycerides, 
and/or  total  bilirubin,  and  moderately  decreased  albumin  and  albumin/globulin  ratio.  Other 
changes in clinical chemistry parameters included minimally to mildly increased cholesterol 
and mildly decreased calcium (associated with decreased albumin). During a 10-week recovery 
period,  there  were  no  CT-P59-related  changes  in  clinical  pathology  parameters,  indicating 
complete recovery. 
In  conclusion,  test  article-related  effects  included  changes  in  hematology,  coagulation,  and 
clinical  chemistry  parameters,  however,  with  the  exception  of  the  transient  moderately  to 
markedly decreased neutrophils from two (Animal Nos. 4004 and 4105) out of ten 400 mg/kg 
dosed animals, all other CT-P59-related findings were not considered adverse. The markedly 
decreased  neutrophil  count,  though  fully  reversible,  were  considered  adverse  based  on  the 
inherent related increased risk for infections (Ramaiah et al., 2017) rather than a direct high 
toxic  effect;  and    the  no-observed-adverse-effect  (NOAEL)  was  defined  200  mg/kg  IV

accordingly. Additionally,  no  remarkable  findings  were  reported  from  the  macroscopic  and 
microscopic examination of injection sites from all animals. 
There were no serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, with administration 
of CT-P59 have reported during the clinical trials; the changes from baseline in all available 
hematology  and  clinical  chemistry  laboratory  parameters  showed  no  notable  differences 
among the CT-P59 40 mg/kg, CT-P59 80 mg/kg and Placebo groups. Therefore, there is no 
clinical relevance of the acute phase reaction found several animals including two of the high 
dose animals in the 3-week repeat-dose study. 
•  Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted. This is in accordance with 
the  ICH  Safety  Guideline  S6(R1)  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived 
Pharmaceuticals  (ICH  2011),  which  does  not  recommend  reproductive  and  developmental 
studies  for  monoclonal  antibodies  that  target  exogenous  proteins,  since  these  types  of 
antibodies are unlikely to cause reproductive or developmental toxicity. In the 2-week repeat 
dose  non-human  primate  toxicity  study,  no  adverse  effects  were  noted  in  the  reproductive 
organs of males or females. 
•  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted. This is in accordance with the ICH Safety Guideline 
S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH 2011), 
which  does  not  recommend  genotoxicity  for  monoclonal  antibodies  that  target  exogenous 
proteins, since these types of antibodies are unlikely to be genotoxic. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Safety 
Guideline  S6(R1)  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived  Pharmaceuticals 
(ICH 2011), which does not recommend carcinogenicity studies for monoclonal antibodies that 
target exogenous proteins since these types of antibodies are unlikely to be carcinogenic. 
Safety pharmacology  
•  General Safety Pharmacology 
No  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  study  was  performed  according  to  the  ICH  Safety 
Guideline  S6(R1)  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived  Pharmaceuticals 
(ICH  2011).  Safety  end-points  were  incorporated  into  the  2-week  and  3-week  repeat-dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity in the repeat-
dose study performed as part of non-clinical investigations. Consequently, no stand-alone non-
clinical cardiotoxicity study has been conducted with CT-P59.  
Other toxicity-related information or data  
•  Mechanisms for Drug Interactions 
On  the  basis  of  the  specificity  of  regdanvimab,  no  non-clinical  studies  pertinent  to  drug 
interaction have been conducted.

PART II:  MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Regdanvimab is a human monoclonal antibody targeted against the receptor binding domain (RBD) 
of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is being 
developed as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dosage form of regdanvimab is solution 
concentrate for dilution for administration in a single intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Clinical studies with regdanvimab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection comprised one completed 
and one ongoing studies,  
• 
• 
a  pilot  phase  1,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group,  single 
ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and virology of CT-P59 in patient 
with  mild  symptoms  of  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-2) 
Infection (Study CT-P59 1.2) (Completed); 
a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2/3 study in patients 
with  mild  to  moderate  symptoms  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and 
safety of CT-P59 in combination with standard of care (Study CT-P59 3.2) (Ongoing). 
As  of  June  11th,  2021,  a  total  of  882  subjects  with  SARS-CoV-2  infection  were  exposed  to 
regdanvimab. 
Duration of exposure is unavailable since all clinical trials were designed as single treatment with

PART II: 
MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
SIV.1 
Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development programme 
Patient who has known allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody or to 
any components of study drug. 
Reason for exclusion: These patients were excluded from the clinical development programme for 
safety reasons. Patients with a known allergy would be at a higher risk of subsequent serious systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions with re-exposure. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?: No 
Rationale:  As  per  the  EU  SmPC,  regdanvimab  is  contraindicated  in  patients  who  have 
hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance(s)  or  to  any  of  the  excipients  of  the  drug,  therefore,  it  is 
unlikely that regdanvimab will be used in these patients. 
Female patient who is currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to be pregnant or to 
breastfeed, or male patient who is planning to father a child or donate sperms throughout the 
study (up to 6 months after the study drug administration). 
Reason for exclusion: The use of regdanvimab is not contraindicated during pregnancy or breast-
feeding,  however,  whether regdanvimab is secreted in  human milk and  how regdanvimab  affects 
developing foetus are still unknown with a limited evidence. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?: Yes

Reason for exclusion: Patients who have taken other antiviral drugs were excluded from the pivotal 
clinical studies to prevent confounding interpretation of efficacy endpoints.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?: No 
Rationale:  Regdanvimab  is  not  renally  excreted  or  metabolized  by  cytochrome  P450  enzymes; 
therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, 
inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.  
SIV.2 
Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as 
rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged exposure 
or cumulative exposure. 
A total of 882 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection were exposed to regdanvimab during the clinical 
trials. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with a frequency greater than approximately 1 in 294 subjects 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be detected with a data set of this size.

Therefore, the decision to treat nursing mothers 
with  regdanvimab  should  be  based  on  an 
individualized assessment of risk and benefit. 
Whether  regdanvimab  is  excreted  in  human 
milk and what impact regdanvimab will have on 
infant  who  is  exposed  to  regdanvimab  during 
lactation  are  not  known.  As  experience  is 
limited, regdanvimab should be considered only 
when benefit to mother outweighs possible risk 
to  child  upon  assessment  of  a  duly  qualified 
health care professional. 
17 subjects with chronic liver disease were 
treated with regdanvimab in clinical trials. 
12 subjects with chronic kidney disease 
including those on dialysis were treated with 
regdanvimab in clinical trials. 
241 subjects with cardiovascular disease 
including hypertension were treated with 
regdanvimab in clinical trials. 
Immunosuppressed patients were included in

PART II:  MODULE SVII - IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
SVII.1 
Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission  
SVII.1.1. 
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the RMP: 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low frequency and 
considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated:  
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 
There were no patients with suspected antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) during the clinical 
trials and no ADE was reported from in vitro or in vivo non-clinical studies. Although ADE has been 
observed in SARS, MERS and other human respiratory virus infections including RSV and measles, 
presently there is no proof that ADE occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and there are merely various 
hypotheses as per the earlier reports of SARS and MERS-CoV and also with few in vitro studies 
with SARS-CoV-2. The ability of the antibody to neutralize the virus has a role in the production of 
ADE, however, clinical data has not established a role for ADE in human COVID-19 pathology. As 
evidence for a potential causal relationship between regdanvimab and ADE is lacking and only a 
theoretical risk exists, ADE is not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns. 
SVII.1.2. 
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Important Identified Risk 
No identified risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Important Potential Risk 
No potential risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Missing Information 1: Use during pregnancy  
Risk-benefit impact: The safety of regdanvimab in pregnant women is not known as no studies of 
regdanvimab have been conducted in pregnant women. The use of regdanvimab in pregnant female 
patients is possible in clinical practice. 
Missing Information 2: Long-term safety data  
Risk-benefit impact:  Long-term safety data of regdanvimab are limited from clinical trials. There 
may be long-term consequences that have not yet been seen in patients that have been studied so far.

Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
There are no important identified and potential risks for regdanvimab. 
SVII.3.2. 
Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information - Use during pregnancy  
Evidence source:  
The safety of regdanvimab in pregnant women is not known as no studies of regdanvimab have been 
conducted in pregnant women.  
Population in need of further characterisation: 
The use of regdanvimab in pregnant female patients is possible in clinical practice. As experience is 
limited, the use of regdanvimab in pregnancy should only be considered if the possible benefit to the 
patient is thought to outweigh any possible risk to the foetus. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
IgG  immunoglobulins  are  known  to  cross  the  placental  barrier,  therefore  regdanvimab  has  the 
potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. There are no adequate and well-
controlled data with regdanvimab from studies in pregnant women.  
Missing information - Long-term safety data 
Evidence source:  
Long-term safety data of regdanvimab are limited from clinical trials. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
There may be long-term consequences that have not yet been seen in patients that have been studied 
so far. More information on long-term safety of regdanvimab is required. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
Considering regdanvimab is intended to be given as a single dose and a half-life of regdanvimab at 
a recommended dose of 40 mg/kg is estimated as 15.6 days, long-term consequences that may be 
unexpectedly  observed  after  treatment  with  regdanvimab  are  anticipated  to  be  uncommon. 
Nonetheless, a potential long-term consequences that regdanvimab may have will be monitored.

PART III:  PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-AUTHORISATION 
SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for lack of efficacy (LOE): 
Lack  of efficacy  report form will  be  provided to reporters once lack of  efficacy is received via 
individual case safety reports (ICSRs) from post-marketing data sources, in order to obtain structured 
information  of  lack  of  efficacy  including  reaction  information,  patient  demographics,  treatment 
information such as dose, route, therapy date and batch number, concomitant medications, medical 
history,  product-related  complaints,  immunogenicity  information  and  investigational  result 
regarding genetic variations of virus. This form is intended to see if the reported lack of efficacy is 
associated  with  emerging  variants.  The  information  regarding  lack  of  efficacy  due  to  emerging 
variants will be retrospectively collected and will be properly reflected into each ICSR as follow-up 
information. 
Monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants: 
As part of the enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, data 
on treatment failure due to emerging variants are to be monitored from all available data sources, 
including but not limited to 
•  Spontaneous  cases  (via  targeted  follow-up  questionnaire  for  LOE  including  fields  to  request 
information on the variant) 
•  Clinical trial data 
•  Literature 
•  Reports received from regulatory authorities 
If the review of the data identifies an impact on the benefit-risk profile of regdanvimab, the data will 
be submitted to EMA, including a benefit-risk discussion and any  warranted product information 
updates within 1 month via appropriate variation procedure. Additionally, the cumulative data will 
be summarised in the PSUR. 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities: 
A new variant of concern or variant of interest newly classified by the Agencies (i.e. WHO; World 
Health Organization, PHE; Public Health England, CDC; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and  etc.)  or  any  newly  emerging  variants  will  be  continuously  monitored,  and  their  risk  will  be 
assessed. If the risk is identified, non-clinical studies to characterise regdanvimab in relation to the 
variant in question will be initiated.

PART VI: 
SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Regkirona 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Regkirona. The RMP details important 
risks of Regkirona, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Regkirona's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Regkirona's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Regkirona should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Regkirona  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Regkirona's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Regkirona is authorised for treatment of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains regdanvimab as the active substance and it is given by 
intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Regkirona’s benefits can be found in Regkirona’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Regkirona, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Regkirona's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Regkirona is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Regkirona  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Regkirona.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement  
Gastroesophageal  reflux  disease  (GERD)  is  defined  as  a  condition  that  develops  when  the  reflux  of 
stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Reflux of gastric content into 
the  oesophagus  is  mediated  by  different  mechanisms  such  as  low  basal  pressure  or  transient 
relaxations  of  the  lower  oesophageal  sphincter.  Heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  are  the  typical 
symptoms associated with GERD and the most common complication is reflux oesophagitis. GERD is 
one  of  the  most  frequent  diseases  in  western  world,  with  a  prevalence  of  10%  to  20%.  In 
epidemiological  trials  it  has  been  shown  that  heartburn  occurs  at  least  once  per  month  in  30%  to 
40% of all adults, at least once per week in 10% to 20% of all adults and daily in 4% to 10% of all 
adults in the western countries. 
For  many  patients,  acid  regurgitation  and  heartburn  can  severely  affect  quality  of  life.  Night-time 
heartburn may cause sleeping difficulties and impair next-day function. The impact on quality of life 
by GERD is comparable to that of more serious diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, depression 
and arthritis (Wiklund et al 19981, Lind et al 19992, Gerson et al 20053, Vakil et al 20064, Jones et al 
20075).  An  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  by  providing  effective  treatment  of  the  symptoms  is 
therefore  the  predominant  therapeutic  goal  for  the  treatment  of  acid  reflux  disease.  Clinical  studies 
with GERD patients showed that an appropriate inhibition of the acid secretion resulted in an effective 
reduction of symptoms (Richter et al 20006).  
Most  patients  do  not  consider  treating  occasional  and  mild  heartburn,  but  the  desire  for  treatment 
grows with increasing frequency and intensity of the symptoms. Most patients prefer self-medication 
for  the  initial  treatment  of  heartburn  symptoms  and  only  consult  a  doctor  if  the  symptoms  persist 
(Galmiche et al 19987, Inadomi and Fendrick 20058, Bretagne et al 20079, Jones and Ballard 200810, 
Tytgat  et  al  200811).  Tytgat  et  al  estimate  that  the  number  of  patients  who  either  self-medicate  or 
are  untreated  is  around  80%.  The  time  lag  between  the  first  symptoms  and  consultation  with  a

doctor  depends  mainly  on  the  intensity  of  the  symptoms  and  the  extent  to  which  the  symptoms 
interfere with daily life (Tytgat 200312). 
Non-prescription medicines for self-treatment of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation include antacids, 
histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although both having 
a  rapid  onset  of  action,  the  effect  lasted  longer  on  H2-RA  therapy  than  on  antacids,  but  was 
significantly  shorter  than  when  on  PPIs.  Meta-analysis  found  that  PPIs  were  the  most  effective 
therapy  when  compared with  antacids  and  H2-RAs.  Recent  clinical  guidelines  recommend  treatment 
with PPIs as initial therapy for patients with symptoms impacting on their quality of life, while H2-RAs 
are recommended for patients whose symptoms are mild or infrequent. 
About the product  
Esomeprazole (the S-isomer of omeprazole) is a proton pump inhibitor, i.e., it inhibits specifically the 
gastric  H+/K+-ATPase  enzyme,  which  is  responsible  for  acid  secretion  in  the  parietal  cells  of  the 
stomach.  The  efficacy  of  esomeprazole  for  treatment  of  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  is  well 
established.  Esomeprazole  as  an  oral  formulation  was  first  approved  for  marketing  in  Sweden  in 
2000,  and  is  currently  approved  in  more  than  125  countries  for  various  acid  related  disorders.  The 
supply status in all Member States is “prescription-only medicine”. 
The application is submitted through the Centralised Procedure as a hybrid application meaning that 
reference  was  made  to  an  already  approved  product  but  that  changes  in  the  therapeutic  indication 
compared  to  the  reference  product  were  applied  for  supported  by  the  results  of  appropriate 
nonclinical test or clinical trials.  
The  reference  product  used  for  this  purpose  is  Nexium  20  mg  gastro-resistant  tablets,  which  is 
approved  as  a  prescription  drug  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  Gastroesophageal  Reflux  Disease

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  gastro-resistant  tablets  containing  20  mg  of  esomeprazole  (as 
magnesium  trihydrate)  as  the  active  substance.  The  other  ingredients  are  glycerol  monostearate, 
hydroxypropyl  cellulose,  hypromellose,  magnesium  stearate,  methacrylic  acid,  ethyl  acrylate, 
cellulose  microcrystalline,  paraffin,  macrogols,  polysorbate  80,  crospovidone,  sodium  stearyl 
fumarate,  sucrose,  corn  starch,  talc,  titanium  dioxide,  iron  oxide,  triethyl  citrate  and  hydrogen 
peroxide. 
The esomeprazole gastro-resistant tablets 20 mg for non-prescription have the same qualitative and 
quantitative composition as the reference product Nexium 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets (Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) – AstraZeneca AB).  
The gastro-resistant tablets are marketed in aluminium blister packs as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
2.2.1.  Active substance 
The chemical name of esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate is Bis(5-methoxy-2-{(S)[(4-methoxy-3,5-
dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl) magnesium and has the following 
structure: 
Esomeprazole  magnesium  trihydrate  is  a  white  to  slightly  coloured  crystalline  powder,  not 
hygroscopic  and  soluble  in  aqueous  solutions  with  pH  of  10.0.  This  active  substance  contains  one 
asymmetrically substituted sulphoxide moiety which makes the molecule chiral. The Esomeprazole is 
the  S-enantiomer  of  omeprazole.  The  enantiomeric  purity  of  this  active  substance  is  controlled 
routinely by HPLC on a chiral-AGP column. 
Esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate has a high degree of crystallinity and, only one crystalline form 
has been identified by X-ray.  
A monograph of this active substance has been described in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
The  chemical  structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  infrared  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet 
spectroscopy,  1H NMR spectroscopy,  13C NMR spectroscopy, optical rotation and mass spectrometry. 
The  results  of  the  elemental  analysis  are  consistent  with  the  proposed  molecular  formula 
(C34H36N6O6S2 Mg • 3H2O).  
Manufacture 
Esomeprazole  magnesium  trihydrate  is  synthesized  in  four  main  steps  using  commercially  available 
and  well  defined  starting  materials.  The  final  active  substance  is  purified  by  crystallisation.  The 
chirality  of  the  intermediate  has  an  impact  in  the  final  chirality  profile  of  the  active  substance.  The 
chirality of the active substance is controlled routinely by HPLC on a chiral-AGP column and specific 
optical  rotation.  All  critical  steps  have  been  identified  and  discussed.  The  manufacturing  process  is 
well described. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and

control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and 
fully described. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  and  residual  solvents  are  in 
accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  on  three  production  scale  batches  produced  by  the  proposed 
synthetic  route,  and  the  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  active  ingredient  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly. 
The  purified  active  substance  is  packed  in  double  polyethylene  tied  up  bags,  the  plastic  bags  are 
placed in  polyethylene  lined  aluminium  bags,  which  are  welded.  These  are  placed  in  plastic  or  steel 
containers for mechanical protection. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR;  UV, 
optical  rotation),  magnesium  identity  (atomic  absorption  spectrometry),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), water (KF), absorbance (UV), sulphates, 
titanium and cumene alcohol (GC). 
The  specification  and  analytical  procedures  are  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  ,  and  includes 
additional testing on absorbance of solution, residual solvents, sulphates and  titanium. 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was  also 
provided  for  the  in-house  analytical  methods  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH  Guidelines.  The 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
All results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
(polyethylene  bags)  from  the  proposed  manufacturers  were  put  on  stability  testing  as  per  ICH 
conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up 36 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 
6 months. The active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according to 
the commercial process.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  assay  (HPLC  98.0–  102.0%),  identification  (UV)  and 
impurities (HPLC). 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  by  exposing  one  batch  of  the  active  substance  to  high 
temperature,  acid,  base  and  oxidative  conditions.  It  was  only  noted  a  slight  increase  of  impurities, 
but still within specification limits of the active substance.  
Photostability  testing  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  of  the  active 
substance.  The  results  showed  that  there  are  no  significant  changes  for  any  of  the  evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room temperature. The 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.2.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  gastro-resistant  tablets.  The  active 
ingredient  is  a  trihydrate  of  the  alkaline  magnesium  salt  of  esomeprazole.  This  active  substance  is 
thermodynamically  stable,  crystalline  and  non-hygroscopic.  The  active  substance  is  soluble  in   
aqueous  solutions.  All  these  physicochemical  properties  were  taken  into  account  during  the  drug 
development.  The  excipients  used  are  common  for  this  type  of  dosage  form  and  are  of 
pharmacopoeial quality. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
This  medicinal  product  has  been  developed  to  be  a  gastric  acid  secretion  inhibitor.  However,  the 
active substance is rapidly decomposed in acidic media. Therefore, an enteric-coated formulation was 
developed in order to avoid any decomposition of the active substance. 
The quantities of the tableting excipients were chosen so that they with good margins will form hard, 
fast  disintegrating  and  non-friable  tablets.  Two  tablet  strengths  of  20  mg  and  40  mg  have  been 
developed. The manufacturing process and excipients used for both strengths are the same and the 
only  difference  is  the  quantity  of  the  active  substance.  Nevertheless,  the  applicant  intends  to 
commercialise only the 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets. 
An in vitro dissolution test method including pre-exposure in 0.1 M HCl for two hours followed by an 
increase of the pH to 6.8 was conducted and evaluated in terms of predictability in vivo. In addition, 
a bioavailability study was conducted on three tablets with different releases profiles.  Moreover, the 
data  form  two  previous  bioavailability  studies  were  included  as  supportive  data.  The  in  vitro 
dissolution test method provided a level A correlation for  formulations having  an in  vitro dissolution 
of  70%  or  less  at  30  minutes.  Tablets  that  have  shown  a  faster  release  rate  than  this  upper  limit 
were shown to have no significant differences in bioavailability. Based on the results of these studies, 
it was concluded that in vitro dissolution rate predicts an acceptable bioavailability properties. 
Detailed  information  has  been  provided  regarding  the  formulation  development  and  manufacturing 
history  in  terms  of  the  formulation,  process  and  sites  and  extensive  batch  data  confirms  the 
consistency/uniformity of the products.  
The  primary  packaging  proposed  is  adequately  described  (Aluminium  blister  packs).  The  packaging 
materials comply with Ph.Eur. requirements and are adequate to support the stability and use of the 
product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  eight  main  steps.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-
standard manufacturing process. 
The GMP are in place to ensure the quality of the finished product. Additionally, all critical steps  have 
been identified and the physical and chemical properties of the intermediates are controlled during 
the manufacturing process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 14/70 
 
  
  
A validation study of full-scale manufacturing was performed at the manufacturing site. Major steps 
of the manufacturing process have been validated. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
The  batch  analysis  data  on  three  batches  per  strength  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly  according  to  the  agreed  finished  product  specification,  which  is  suitable  for  control  of 
this oral preparation. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form such 
a  as  appearance  (visual),  uniformity  of  mass  (Ph.Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.), 
identification (chiral LC), assay (HPLC), dissolution, impurities (HPLC) and microbiology (Ph.Eur.).  
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  commercial  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial batches of the finished product stored under long term conditions 
for 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the same primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The shelf-life specifications are identical to the release product specifications except for the limits for 
impurities and assay. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No  significant  changes  in specifications were  noticed  during  the  stability-testing  period  at long  term 
and accelerated conditions. 
In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  Q1B  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. It was confirmed that the finished product is not light-
sensitive.  
Based on the available stability data, the shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
has  been  presented in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  potential impurities,  by  products  of  the  synthesis 
and  degradation  products,  have  been  discussed  in  detail  and  do  not  raise  any  safety  concern.  The 
goal  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  gastro-resistant  tablets.  Hence,  an  enteric-
coated formulation was developed to avoid any decomposition of the active substance. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Based  on  the  data  provided  the  quality  of  this  medicinal  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable. 
Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

None 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  applicant  provided  an  acceptable  summary  of  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicology  of  esomeprazole  based  on  published  literature  as  well  as  from  the  reference  application. 
No  further  non-clinical  studies  are  required  and  the  applicant  has  justified  why  no  such  data  were 
provided. 
Since the manufacturing of the product Nexium Control is identical to that of the Reference Product, 
there  is  no  requirement  to  specifically  address  the  impurity  profile  of  the  new  product  from  a  non-
clinical perspective. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology 
Since esomeprazole is a single enantiomer of a racemate (omeprazole) that was already a marketed 
drug, only a limited number of nonclinical studies were necessary for the reference application. The 
results  of  the  bridging  studies  submitted  with  the  reference  application  showed  that  esomeprazole 
and  omeprazole  are  pharmacologically  and  toxicologically  similar  at  equivalent  systemic  exposure. 
Thus,  the  extensive  nonclinical  database  on  omeprazole  was  also  considered  relevant  to  the  safety 
assessment of esomeprazole. 
In  summary  it  can  be  considered  that  due  to  the  unique  mechanism  and  specific  effect  on  acid 
secretion,  omeprazole/esomeprazole  has  no  other  significant,  unrelated  pharmacodynamic  effects. 
The toxicology studies conducted for the reference application with esomeprazole indicated that this 
compound  possesses  a  low  systemic  toxicity  after  both  single  and  repeated  oral  administration  to 
animals.  In programs to investigate the mutagenic potentials of both esomeprazole and omeprazole 
it was shown that esomeprazole was not clastogenic under in vivo conditions.  Based on the results in 
these  tests,  and  in  conjunction  with the  large  number  of  mutagenicity  studies  previously  performed 
on  omeprazole,  it  was  concluded  that  esomeprazole  does  not  represent  a  genotoxic  risk  to  man. 
Results in the embryo-foetal toxicity studies with esomeprazole did not indicate a risk to humans at 
the doses approved or proposed for use in clinical studies.

An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been undertaken for esomeprazole in accordance with 
the  EMA  guideline.  The  assessment  showed  that  the  intended  use  of  esomeprazole  would  result 
mainly  in  metabolites  entering  the  environment,  since  it  is  almost  completely  metabolised  after 
administration. The metabolites are predicted to partition to the aqueous phase and eventually target 
the aquatic environment via sewage treatment. 
In the aquatic environment, esomeprazole is likely to be rapidly degraded abiotically at a neutral pH, 
25°C, whereas the degradation rate is somewhat slower at lower temperatures. Esomeprazole is not 
readily biodegradable, however, there is evidence that the substance will partition into, and degrade

rapidly  within,  aquatic  sediments.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  compound  will  bioaccumulate  in  aquatic 
organisms. 
Only  a  small  fraction  of  the  compound  is  predicted  to  be  removed  via  sewage  sludge  and  hence 
exposure to the terrestrial environment is not expected to be significant. 
The  PEC/PNEC  ratios  for  microorganisms,  surface  water,  ground  water  and  sediment  are  all  below 
0.1. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
From the non-clinical point of view the esomeprazole pharmacology was adequately investigated. The 
toxicological  properties  of  omeprazole  have  previously  been  extensively  studied,  and  it  has  been 
shown that omeprazole is well tolerated in animals at dose levels that are well above those used in 
clinical  practice.  Results  from  the  bridging  studies  showed  that  esomeprazole  and  omeprazole  are 
toxicologically similar at equivalent systemic exposure. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical documentation on esomeprazole, in combination with the non-clinical documentation 
on the racemate omeprazole, plus the extensive experience of and documentation on the clinical use 
of both esomeprazole and omeprazole, is considered to support the non-prescription status of 20 mg 
esomeprazole,  once  daily  in  adults.  The  environmental  risk  assessment  based  on  use  of 
esomeprazole did not identify a potential risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This  hybrid  application  refers  to  the  approved  product  Nexium  20  mg  gastro-resistant  tablets  and 
concerns a change in the indication for use as non-prescription medicine. The claimed indication is for 
short-term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  (e.g.  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation)  in  adults.  The 
claimed posology is 20mg esomeprazole for a maximum of 4 weeks. 
The Applicant submitted 2 Phase I Clinical Pharmacology drug-drug interaction studies and 2 identical 
Phase III Short-term efficacy and safety studies (QBE 0053 [Study 225] and QBE 0054 [Study 226]). 
The latter were considered as main studies for the claimed indication (see Table 2). 
As  study  medication  esomeprazole  formulated  into  capsules  was  used.  Nexium  gastro-resistant 
tablets  which  are  referenced  here  were  bridged  to  Nexium  Phase  III  clinical  trial  capsules  in 
bioequivalence studies included in the original Nexium file (SE/H/211/01-02).  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

For the safety evaluation a review derived from the applicant’s worldwide clinical trial database and 
post-marketing  surveillance  data  together  with  a  risk-benefit  consideration  for  non-prescription 
status have been provided.  
The applied for medicinal product and the reference product are from a quality perspective identical 
in  terms  of  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition,  and  manufacturing  sites  and  processes  are 
identical. Therefore, no bioequivalence data between the two products were required.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in support of this application and full reference was 
made to the available data for the reference product. This is considered acceptable. 
Data on the pharmacokinetic profile of esomeprazole in line with the SmPC for the reference product 
relevant for this application are presented below. 
Absorption  
Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, is acid labile and is administered orally as enteric-coated 
granules. In vivo conversion to the R-isomer is negligible. Peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 
to 2 hours after dose. The absolute bioavailability is 64% after a single dose of 40 mg and increases 
to 89% after repeated once-daily administration. For 20 mg esomeprazole the corresponding values 
are 50% and 68%, respectively.  
Food  intake  both  delays  and  decreases  the  absorption  of  esomeprazole  although  this  has  no 
significant influence on the effect of esomeprazole on intragastric acidity.  The AUC of esomeprazole 
magnesium  decreased  by  33%  for  a  single  dose  and  26%  at  steady  state  on  day  5  when 
administered after food intake compared with the fasting state, based on a single 40 mg dose. Taking 
into consideration that the PD effect was independent from food intake this is acceptable for the OTC 
status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 20/70 
 
  
  
 
Elimination 
Total plasma clearance of esomeprazole is about 17 L/h following a single dose and about 9 L/h after 
repeated administration. The plasma elimination half-life is about 1.3 hours after repeated once-daily 
dosing. 
Almost 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as metabolites in the urine, the remainder in 
the  faeces.  Less  than  1%  of  the  parent  drug  is  found  in  urine.  The  applicant  explains  that  major 
metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion.  
Esomeprazole  is  completely  metabolised  by  the  cytochrome  P450  system  (CYP).  The  major  part  of 
the  metabolism  of  esomeprazole  is  dependent  on  the  polymorphic  CYP2C19,  responsible  for  the 
formation  of  the  hydroxy-  and  desmethyl  metabolites  of  esomeprazole.  The  remaining  part  is 
dependent on CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of esomeprazole sulphone, the main metabolite 
in  plasma.  The  parameters  in  this  section  reflect  mainly  the  pharmacokinetics  in  individuals  with  a 
functional CYP2C19 enzyme, ie, extensive metabolisers.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  esomeprazole  has  been  studied  in  doses  up  to  40  mg  b.i.d.  The  AUC 
increases with repeated administration of esomeprazole. This increase is dose-dependent and results 
in a more than dose proportional increase in AUC after repeated administration. This time - and dose-
dependency is due to a decrease of first pass metabolism and systemic clearance probably caused by 
an inhibition of the CYP2C19 enzyme by esomeprazole and/or its sulphone metabolite. Esomeprazole 
is completely eliminated from plasma between doses with no tendency for accumulation during once-
daily administration. 
Special populations 
Poor  metabolisers  are  individuals  who  lack  a  functional  CYP2C19  enzyme  and  probably  mainly 
catalyses  esomeprazole  by  CYP3A4  (~2.9±1.5%  of  the  western  population).  After  repeated  once-
daily administration of 40 mg esomeprazole, the mean AUC was approximately 100% higher in poor 
metabolisers  than  in  subjects  having  a  functional  CYP2C19  enzyme  (extensive  metabolisers).  Mean 
peak plasma concentrations were increased by about 60%.  
No studies have been performed to assess patients with decreased renal function. Since the kidney is 
responsible  for  the  excretion  of  the  metabolites  of  esomeprazole  but  not  for  the  elimination  of  the 
parent  compound,  the  metabolism  of  esomeprazole  is  not  expected  to  be  changed  in  patients  with 
impaired renal function.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  in  a  small  study  (Sjoevall  et  al.,  200013),  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
esomeprazole,  including  AUC  and  half-life,  were  similar  in  patients  with  mild-to-moderate  hepatic 
dysfunction  (cirrhosis)  and  those  with  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease  and  normal  liver  function. 
However,  significant  plasma  level  increases  were  seen  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  dysfunction

The  applicant  states  that  the  metabolism  of  esomeprazole  is  not  significantly  changed  in  elderly 
subjects (71-80 years of age). In a study performed by Hasselgren et al., 200114 in elderly patients 
Area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  and  maximum  concentration  (C-max)  at  steady  state  dosing  of  40 
milligrams/day  were  slightly  higher  (25%  and  18%,  respectively)  in  13  healthy  elderly  subjects 
(mean  74  years  old)  compared  to  36  healthy  middle-aged  subjects  (mean  45  years  old).  However, 
between-group differences were not statistically significant, and dose adjustments are not thought to 
be required for elderly patients. 
Children. Esomeprazole with non-prescription status is not intended for use in patients under the age 
of 18 years. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Two specific studies were performed to assess PK/PD interaction with clopidogrel: 
Study  D9612C00034  was  phase  1  study  to  evaluate  esomeprazole  40  mg,  omeprazole  80  mg,  or 
lansoprazole  60  mg  on  PD  and  PK  of  clopidogrel  in  healthy  volunteers.  This  study  evaluated 
maximum  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation  (mIPA)  as  primary  endpoint  (PD);  Cmax,  tmax,  AUC(0-t), 
AUC (PK), and adverse events, clinical laboratory results, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, 
vital signs (safety) as secondary endpoints; change in platelet reactivity index (Δ PRI) and maximum 
inhibition of platelet aggregation and CYP2C19 genotyping (PD) as exploratory endpoints. 
Each  volunteer  was  randomly  assigned  to  receive  a  sequence  of  oral  clopidogrel  alone  and  2  of  the 
proton pump inhibitors + clopidogrel. The reference treatment arm consisted of a clopidogrel 300 mg 
dose on Day 1 and then clopidogrel 75 mg qd for 28 days. The 3 test treatment arms had the same 
clopidogrel dosing used in the reference treatment arm + either esomeprazole 40 mg, omeprazole 80 
mg, or lansoprazole 60 mg qd for 29 days. The treatment periods were separated by washout periods 
of at least 14 days. Volunteers were admitted to the clinic on Days -1, 4, 13, and 28 and released on 
Days 2, 6, 15, and 30 after the scheduled PK and PD assessments were obtained. The study duration 
was approximately 146 days, including a 21-day pre-entry screening and a 7-day follow-up visit. 
In  total,  108  subjects  were  involved  (63  males  [58.3%]  and  45  females  [41.7%]),  87  (80.6%)  of 
them completed all planned study treatments (i.e., all 3 dosing periods per protocol) and 21 (19.4%) 
volunteers  were  discontinued  from  the  study.  One  SAE  (spontaneous  abortion)  occurred  after  a 
volunteer  was  withdrawn  due  to  pregnancy.  One  volunteer  discontinued  due  to  a  SAE  of 
schizophrenia and 5 volunteers were discontinued due to non-serious AEs.

All 108 volunteers enrolled in the study were analysed for safety, 101 volunteers were included in PK 
and PD analyses. 
PK.  Lansoprazole,  omeprazole,  and  esomeprazole  co-administration  significantly  decreased 
exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel (H4) compared to clopidogrel alone on Days 5, 
14, and 29, but not on Day 1. 
Lansoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole co-administration decreased overall exposure [AUC(0-
t)] of H4 on average 24%, 41%, and 38%, respectively, on Day 5, on average 24%, 46%, and 39%, 
respectively, on Day 14 and on average 17%, 45%, and 35%, respectively, on Day 29. Lansoprazole, 
omeprazole,  and  esomeprazole  co-administration  decreased  maximum  exposure  (Cmax)  of  H4  on 
average  27%,  46%,  and  46%,  respectively,  on  Day  5,  on  average  29%,  51%,  and  43%, 
respectively, on Day 14 and on average 18%, 49%, and 37%, respectively, on Day 29. 
The  lower  limit  of  the  90%  CI  of  the  geometric  mean  ratio  for  active  metabolite  (H4)  AUC(0-t),  and 
Cmax comparing each proton pump inhibitor + clopidogrel (test) to clopidogrel alone (reference) was 
contained within the equivalence limits of 80% to 125% on Day 1 and fell below the lower bounds of 
the equivalence limits of 80% to 125% on Days 5, 14 and 29. 
PD.  Primary  variable  maximal  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation,  (mIPA).  Esomeprazole  and 
omeprazole  co-administration  significantly  decreased  mean  mIPA  compared  to  clopidogrel  alone  on 
Days  6,  15,  and  30  while  lansoprazole  co-administration  significantly  decreased  mean  mIPA 
compared  to  clopidogrel  alone  on  Days  2,  6,  15,  and  30.  The  difference  between  the  least-squares 
mean  for  clopidogrel  +  lansoprazole  and  clopidogrel  alone  represents  a 15.9%,  15.0%, 20.5%,  and 
13.5% loss of the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel therapy on Days 2, 6, 15, and 30, respectively. The 
difference  between  the  least-squares  mean  for  clopidogrel  +  omeprazole  and  clopidogrel  alone 
represents a 6.1%, 31.6%, 31.5%, and 33.1% loss of the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel therapy on 
Days 2, 6, 15, and 30, respectively. The difference between the least-squares mean for clopidogrel + 
esomeprazole  and  clopidogrel  alone  represents  a  1.2%,  19.9%,  32.8%,  and  27.2%  loss  of  the 
inhibitory effect of clopidogrel therapy on Days 2, 6, 15, and 30, respectively. 
Secondary  variables.  The  effect  of  each  proton  pump  inhibitor  on  the  inhibition  of  platelet 
aggregation induced by clopidogrel was virtually consistent over time; however, there seemed to be 
some differences in the magnitude of this effect between the different proton pump inhibitors. 
Lansoprazole  co-administration  did  not  significantly  increase  mean  (PRI  -  Platelet  reactivity  index) 
ΔPRI compared to clopidogrel alone on any study day. The magnitude of the increases in mean ΔPRI 
ranged  from  a  low  of  2.4%  on  Day  30  to  a  high  of  4.8%  on  Day  6.  Omeprazole  co-administration 
significantly  increased  mean  ΔPRI  compared  to  clopidogrel  alone  by  11.8%,  13.8%,  and  13.8%  on 
Days 6, 15, and 30, respectively. Esomeprazole co-administration significantly increased mean ΔPRI 
compared  to  clopidogrel  alone  by  10.2%,  13.8%,  and  12.8%  on  Days  6,  15,  and  30,  respectively. 
The magnitude of the increases in mean ΔPRI on Days 6, 15, and 30 were similar to omeprazole. 
Study  D961FC00010  was  phase  1  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  esomeprazole  20 
mg/acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  81  mg  on  the  PD  and  PK  of  clopidogrel  on  Days  1  and  9  in  healthy 
volunteers.  This  study  evaluated  maximal  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation  (mIPA)  as  the  primary 
endpoint  (PD),  AUC,  AUC0-last,  and  Css,  max  (PK)  and  adverse  events,  vital  signs,  laboratory 
variables,  electrocardiogram,  and  physical  examination  (safety)  as  secondary  endpoints;  CYP2C19 
genotyping and PK/PD variables (PD) as exploratory endpoint. 
Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA). During Treatment A, 
volunteers  received  clopidogrel  75  mg  qd  for  9  days.  During  Treatment  B,  volunteers  received 
clopidogrel  75  mg  qd  for  4  days  followed  by  esomeprazole  20  mg/acetylsalicylic  acid  81  mg  with 
clopidogrel  75  mg  qd  for  5  days.  There  was  a  washout  period  of  at  least  14  days  between  each

treatment.  The  study  duration  was  approximately  2.5  months,  including  a  pre-entry  visit  within  28 
days  prior  to  randomization,  2  treatment  periods  of  9  days,  a  washout  period  of  at  least  14  days 
between the treatment periods (i.e., between the last dose in Period 1 and the first dose in Period 2), 
and a follow-up visit 7 to 10 days after the last dose. 
In  total,  58  subjects  were  involved  (35  males  [60.3%]  and  23  females  [39.7%]),  56  (96.6%)  of 
them  completed  the  study  protocol.  One  subject  withdrew  after  receiving  all  doses  of  treatment  B 
and 8 days of treatment A.  
PK:    Administration  of  esomeprazole/ASA  with  clopidogrel  reduced  overall  and  maximum  active 
metabolite of clopidogrel exposure by almost 40% compared to clopidogrel alone. 
Pharmacogenetic  results:  The  lowering  effect  of  esomeprazole/ASA  on  active  metabolite  of 
clopidogrel  exposure  in  the  CYP2C19  poor  and  ultrarapid  metabolizers  did  not  deviate  from  that 
seen for the extensive metabolizers 
PD: The results show there was no statistically significant change in mIPA after administration of 
clopidogrel with esomeprazole/ASA compared to clopidogrel administered alone. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and full reference was made to the available data 
for the reference product. This was considered acceptable. 
Mechanism of action 
Esomeprazole  is  the  S-isomer  of  omeprazole  and  reduces  gastric  acid  secretion  through  a  specific 
targeted mechanism of action. It is a specific inhibitor of the acid pump in the parietal cell. Both the 
R- and S-isomer of omeprazole have similar pharmacodynamic activity. 
Esomeprazole  is  a  weak  base  and  is  concentrated  and  converted  to  the  active  form  in  the  highly 
acidic environment of the secretory canaliculi of the parietal cell, where it inhibits the enzyme H+K+-
ATPase  –  the  acid  pump  and  inhibits  both  basal  and  stimulated  acid  secretion.  Due  to  the  unique 
mechanism and specific effect on acid secretion, omeprazole/esomeprazole have no other significant, 
unrelated pharmacodynamic effect. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Effect on gastric acid secretion: After oral dosing with esomeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg the onset of 
effect occurs within one hour. After repeated administration with 20 mg esomeprazole once daily (qd) 
for 5 days, mean peak acid output after pentagastrin stimulation is decreased 90% when measured 6 
to 7 hours after dosing on day 5. After 5 days of oral dosing with 20 mg and 40 mg of esomeprazole, 
intragastric pH above 4 was maintained for a mean time of 13 hours and 17 hours, respectively over 
24  hours  in  symptomatic  GERD  patients.  The  proportion  of  patients  maintaining  an  intragastric  pH 
above 4  for  at  least  8,  12  and  16  hours  were  for  esomeprazole  20  mg  76%,  54%  and  24%. 
Corresponding  proportions  for  esomeprazole  40  mg  were  97%,  92%  and  56%.  Using  AUC  as  a 
surrogate parameter for plasma concentration, a relationship between inhibition of acid secretion and 
exposure has been shown. 
Effects  related  to  acid  inhibition.  During  treatment  with  antisecretory  drugs  serum  gastrin  and 
chromogranin  A  (CgA)  increase  in  response  to  decreased  acid  secretion.  An  increased  number  of 
enterochromaffin-like  (ECL)  cells,  possibly  related  to  the  increased  serum  gastrin  levels,  have  been 
observed  in  some  patients  during  long-term  treatment  with  esomeprazole.  During  long-term 
treatment with antisecretory drugs gastric glandular cysts occurs at a somewhat increased frequency.

The CHMP acknowledges that these changes are a physiological consequence of pronounced inhibition 
of  acid  secretion  are  benign  and  appear  to  be  reversible.  In  addition,  esomeprazole  with  non-
prescription status is only for short-term use. 
Gastrointestinal infections: In an epidemiological study Garcia Rodriguez et al15 investigated the risk 
of bacterial gastroenteritis in relation to use of acid-suppressing drugs. The study was conducted as a 
nested  case  control  study  using  the  General  Practice  Research  Database  (GPRD)  in  UK.  The  study 
population  comprised  6  414  patients  with  gastrointestinal  bacterial  infections  who  were  matched  to 
50  000  controls.  The  results  from  the  study  showed  that  current  use  of  oral  PPIs  (omeprazole, 
lansoprazole,  pantoprazole,  rabeprazole)  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  bacterial 
gastroenteritis  compared  with  non-use,  regardless  of  the  treatment  duration  (RR:  2.9;  95% 
confidence  interval  [CI]:  2.5-3.5),  whereas  no  association  was  observed  with  H2RA  use  (RR:  1.1; 
95% CI: 0.9 1.4). 
Furthermore, in 2009, the applicant performed on request from a European regulatory authority a full 
literature review of the last 10 years (cut-off November 2008) regarding, the topic“use of PPI and C. 
difficile  infection”.  Although  somewhat  inconsistent  results  were  revealed  from  the  published 
literature  and  no  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  in-house  data,  it  was  concluded  by  the  applicant 
that  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  PPI  treatment  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  C.  difficile 
infection in hospitalized patients. 
PD  interactions.  There  is  known  secondary  interaction  with  clopidogrel  (due  to  PK  interaction)  and 
esomeprazole (two PK/PD interaction studies are described in the PK part of this report above).  
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacology  of  esomeprazole  is  well  established  and  known  from  the  application  for  Nexium, 
which is referenced here. No new studies have been conducted and a summary of the data from the 
reference application is supplied. The formulation of the medicine in this application and the reference 
are identical and therefore no bioequivalence or pharmacokinetic data is required.  
The  major  part  of  the  metabolism  of  esomeprazole  is  dependent  on  CYP2C19  which  is  subject  to 
polymorphism  with  approximately  3%  of  Caucasians  and  15%  to  20%  of  Asians  lacking  CYP2C19 
(poor metabolizers). At steady-state, the ratio of AUC in poor metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the 
population (extensive metabolizers) is approximately 2. 
In a small study (Sjovall et al., 200016) significant plasma level increases were seen in patients with 
severe hepatic dysfunction. Recommendation is given in the SmPC / PL that patients with severe liver 
impairment  should  be  advised  by  a  /  should  talk  to  their  doctor  before  taking  esomeprazole. 
Acknowledging  that  there  are  no  known  dose  related  side  effects  with  omeprazole  or  esomeprazole 
and that for the mother compound (omeprazole) the AUC is 5-10 times higher in poor metabolisers 
than in the rest of the population, and it is still considered to have no implications for the posology 
the CHMP considers that the risk of overdosage is adequately mitigated.  
The  kidney  is  responsible  for  the  excretion  of  the  metabolites  of  esomeprazole  but  not  for  the 
elimination  of  the  parent  compound  therefore  no  dose  adjustment  is  required  in  patients  with 
impaired  renal  function.  However,  due  to  limited  experience  in  patients  with  severe  renal

insufficiency,  such  patients  should  be  treated  with  caution  as  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  The  use  in 
Patients with renal impairment is reflected as missing information in the RMP. 
In  a  study  performed  by  Hasselgren  et  al.,  200117  comparing  elderly  and  middle  aged  patients 
between-group differences  for  Area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  and  maximum  concentration  (C-max)  at 
steady  state  were  not  statistically  significant  and  the  CHMP  agrees  that  dosage  reductions  of 
esomeprazole may not be necessary in geriatric patients as such for the OTC setting. 
Decreased gastric acidity increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal 
tract.  Treatment  with  PPIs  may  lead  to  slightly  increased  risk  of  gastrointestinal  infections  such  as 
Salmonella and Campylobacter and in hospitalised patients, also possibly Clostridium difficile. This is 
appropriately  reflected  in  SmPC  and  PL  for  the  OTC  formulation  and  was  included  as  a  important 
identified risk into the RMP. 
Results from studies in healthy subjects have shown a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction 
between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose/75 mg daily maintenance dose) and esomeprazole (40 mg 
p.o.  daily)  resulting  in  decreased  exposure  to  the  active  metabolite  of  clopidogrel  by  an  average  of 
40%,  and  resulting  in  decreased  maximum  inhibition  of  (ADP  induced)  platelet  aggregation  by  an 
average of 14%. 
When clopidogrel was given together with a fixed dose combination of esomeprazole 20 mg + ASA 81 
mg compared to clopidogrel alone in a study in healthy subjects there was a decreased exposure by 
almost  40%  of  the  active  metabolite  of  clopidogrel.  The  maximum  levels  of  inhibition  of  (ADP 
induced) platelet aggregation in these subjects were the same in the clopidogrel and the clopidogrel 
+ the combined (esomeprazole + ASA) product groups, likely due to the concomitant administration 
of  low  dose  ASA.  Based  on  these  data,  concomitant  use  of  esomeprazole  and  clopidogrel  should  be 
avoided. This information is clearly described in SmPC and PL and is reflected in the RMP. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  esomeprazole  are  well  known  from  the  reference 
product. Particularities with regards to the OTC status are appropriately reflected in SmPC, RMP and 
PIL. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy  
The Applicant presents the results of two studies supporting efficacy of esomeprazole for the claimed 
indication  “short-term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  (e.g.  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation)  in 
adults”. 
Dose response studies 
No  formal  dose-response studies  were  submitted  for  this  application.  Based  on  the  available  clinical 
study  data,  the  applicant  considered  a  daily  dose  of  esomeprazole  20mg  to  be  established  for  the 
short term treatment for patients with GERD, without evidence of erosive oesophagitis. 
Main studies 
Two phase III identical design pivotal studies were conducted: Study QBE 0053 (CSR 225) and Study 
QBE 0054 (CSR 226). Both of them were placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, 
parallel-group, 4-week, efficacy and safety studies of esomeprazole 20 mg and esomeprazole 40 mg

vs. placebo in patients with symptomatic GERD. Study sites were located in the continental USA at 26 
active sites (of 26) for study 225 and at 27 active sites (of 28) for study 226. A total of 664 subjects 
completed the studies (344 and 320 for studies 225 and 226, respectively).  
Study QBE 0053 (CSR 225) and Study QBE 0054 (CSR 226) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients  with  at  least  a  6-month  history  of  heartburn  episodes  who  were  negative  for  erosive 
esophagitis (EE) by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and who reported heartburn on at least 4 of 
the  7  days  immediately  preceding  randomization  were  included.  Patients  were  treated  for  4  weeks 
with  study  medication,  during  which  time  daily  diaries  of  heartburn  occurrence  and  severity  were 
kept  by  the  patients.  Patients  returned  for  clinic  visits  at  Week  2  and  Week  4  to  return  diaries  and 
any  unused  study  medication,  to  be  evaluated  by  the  investigator  for  GERD  symptoms  and  safety, 
and to complete the OTE questionnaire. Eligible patients were randomized to one of three treatment 
groups—H40, H20, or placebo. 
Inclusion  Criteria:  (1)  Adults  between  the  ages  of  18  and  75  inclusive  (and  of  legal  age  to 
consent); (2) heartburn as the main symptom, defined as a burning feeling rising from the stomach 
or  lower  part  of  the  chest  up  towards  the  neck,  and  presenting  with  macroscopically  normal 
oesophageal mucosa, defined as absence of mucosal breaks confirmed by EGD performed within 10 
days of study randomization; (3) a history of episodes of heartburn for 6 months or longer and (4) 
heartburn for 4 days or more during the last 7 days prior to randomisation. 
Exclusion  criteria:  (1)  any  bleeding  disorder  or  signs  of  GI  bleeding  at  the  time  of  the  screening 
EGD or within 3 days prior to randomization; (2) history of or current endoscopic erosive esophagitis 
at  screening  EGD;  (3)  history  of  gastric  or  esophageal  surgery,  except  for  simple  closure  of 
perforated  ulcer;  (4)  current  or  historical  evidence  (within  3  months)  of  the  following 
diseases/conditions:  Zollinger  -  Ellison  syndrome,  primary  oesophageal  motility  disorders, 
oesophageal  stricture,  ulcer  and/or  Barrett’s  metaplasia,  oesophageal  erosion  or  previous  gastric  or 
duodenal  surgery;  (5)  significant  concurrent  disease  (e.g.  cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  renal  or  liver 
disease, malignancy, unstable diabetes mellitus, any condition that may have required surgery during 
the  study);  (6)  PPI  use  within  28  days  prior  to the  baseline  visit; (7)  H2-receptor  antagonist  daily 
during  the  2  weeks  prior to  the  screening  EGD  or  between  the  screening  EGD  and  study  enrolment 
(occasional  use  less  than  daily  was  permitted);  (8)  continuous  treatment  with  nonsteroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs (the use of low-dose aspirin for prophylaxis against cardiovascular diseases was 
allowed); (9) other drugs for the treatment of reflux symptoms use during the studies. 
The EGD was performed on all eligible patients prior to randomization to confirm the absence of EE. 
Gastric biopsies were also obtained during this procedure for use in a histologic test for H. pylori. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio (H40 : H20 : placebo). 
Study medication or placebo (1 capsule of identical appearance) was taken orally, once daily, in the 
morning with a glass of water. A duration of 4 weeks was chosen for the primary efficacy evaluation 
as 4 weeks is an approved treatment duration for patients with symptoms of GERD, without evidence 
of  erosive  esophagitis  (i.e.,  no  oesophageal  mucosal  breaks).  Efficacy  was  also  assessed  after  2

weeks of treatment, since it was hypothesized that esomeprazole could demonstrate efficacy after a 
shorter duration of treatment. 
Prior and concomitant therapies: in addition to Exclusion criteria for prior therapies, during the study 
subjects  were  not  allowed  to  use  (1)  PPIs  (other  than  study  medication);  (2)  H2-receptor 
antagonists;  (3)  other  medications  that  might  have  affected  the  interpretation  of  the  treatment 
outcome  or  were  considered  drug  interactions  in  the  PRILOSEC (omeprazole)  delayed-release 
capsules package insert.  
Rescue  therapy:  during  the  study  subjects  were  allowed  to  use  GELUSIL  tablets  for  acute  GERD 
symptoms  (up  to  6  tablets  per  day).  Gelusil  is  supposed  to  be  an  OTC  product  for  heartburn,  acid 
indigestion  and  gas.  Its  main  ingredients  are  aluminium  hydroxide,  magnesium  hydroxide  and 
simethicone. 
Objectives 
Primary  objective:  to  assess  the  efficacy,  as  defined  by  complete  resolution  of  heartburn  per  diary 
card, of 4 weeks of treatment of Esomeprazole 40 mg qd compared to placebo qd and Esomeprazole 
20 mg qd compared to placebo qd in subjects with GERD. 
The  major  secondary  objectives  were  to  access  the  complete  resolution  of  heartburn,  the  mean 
severity  of  heartburn,  heartburn-free  days,  days  without  nocturnal  heartburn,  and  two  additional 
summaries/analyses (the mean severity of heartburn for each patient, and the percentage of patients 
with relief of heartburn at the end of the study). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  the  percentage  of  patients  who  exhibited  complete  resolution  of 
heartburn  (no  episodes  of  heartburn  during  the  last  7  days  of  the  study,  according  the  patient 
diary card).   
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  build  in  accordance  to  secondary  objectives  e.g.,  the 
percentages  of  patients  with  resolution  of  GERD  symptoms  (heartburn,  acid  regurgitation, 
dysphagia,  and  epigastric  pain)  as  rated  by  the  investigator  at  Week  2  and  Week  4.  (The  GERD 
symptoms were recalled by the patient for the 7 days prior to their study visit and documented. 
The  definitions  for  the  symptoms  being  assessed  were:  (i)  heartburn  -  a  burning  feeling,  rising 
from the stomach or lower part of the chest towards the neck; (ii) acid regurgitation - flow of sour 
or  bitter  fluid  into  mouth;  (iii)  dysphagia  -  difficulties  in  swallowing,  and  (iv)  epigastric  pain  - 
central upper abdominal pain. 
The  assessment  of  each  GERD  symptom  was  to  include  a  rating  of  the  overall  severity  of  each 
symptom  during  the  7  days  preceding  the  visit,  as  follows:  (I)  None  -  No  symptoms;  (ii)  mild  - 
awareness  of  symptom,  but  easily  tolerated;  (iii)  moderate  -  Discomforting  symptom  sufficient  to 
cause interference with normal activities (including sleep); (iv) severe -incapacitating symptom, with 
inability to perform normal activities (including sleep). 
Sample size 
Sample sizes of 100 per group were planned and sizes of treatment groups achieved in studies 225 
and 226 are provided in Table 9.

Table 9. Number of planned, enrolled and analyzed subjects (study 225 and 226). 
Study 225 
Study 226 
The  sample  size  of  100  patients  per  treatment  group  assured  95%  power  to  detect  a  difference  in 
resolution  rates  of  60%  for  an  esomeprazole  treatment  group  and  30%  for  the  placebo  treatment 
group. This assumes a two-sided test, using the arcsine transformation, and a Bonferroni correction 
(ie,  an  alpha  level  of  0.025)  for  the  two  comparisons  (each  esomeprazole  treatment  group  to 
placebo). 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed at each centre using blinded blocks of 6 allocation numbers according 
the applicant‘s scheme. Patients were randomized to treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio (H40: H20: placebo). 
Eligible  patients  at  each  centre  were  given  the  next  sequential  enrolment  number  (001,  002,  003, 
etc)  and  the  next  sequential  allocation  number  based  on  pre-printed  numbers  on  the  study  drug 
labels. 
Blinding (masking) 
For  blinding,  all  study  drugs  had  the  same  appearance.  They  were  packaged  in  bottles  at  Astra 
Hässle  AB,  Mölndal,  Sweden.  Investigators  were  provided  with  individually  sealed  and  blinded 
randomization  envelopes  indicating  the  treatment  allocation  for  each  patient.  All  envelopes  were 
collected and checked by the monitor at the end of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Intent-to Treat (ITT) population: all randomized patients, defined prior to unblinding the data. 
Per  Protocol  population  (PP):  the  subset  of  ITT  patients  without  certain  protocol  deviations,  defined 
prior to unblinding the data.  
Safety population (SAF): All randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
and for whom post-dose data were available. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: The rate of complete resolution of heartburn for the last 7 days in the 
study  was  analyzed  for  ITT  and  PP  populations  regarding  the  data  from  the  last  available  7-day 
period on the diary card.  
Two analyses were performed: (1) A chi-square statistic was used to compare the rate of resolution 
of  heartburn  for  each  esomeprazole  treatment  group  to  the  placebo  group;  (2)  Hochberg’s  method 
was used to adjust for the two comparisons of interest.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: variables were analyzed only for the ITT population, with no adjustment 
for multiple comparisons (only nominal p-values were presented). Chi-square statistics were used for 
comparisons  of  all  dichotomous  response  variables.  The  efficacy  variables  based  on  the  mean 
Assessment report

severity of heartburn or on the percentages of days/nights without heartburn were compared using a 
two-way analysis of variance model (ANOVA), with main effects of investigator and treatment (used 
in Objectives No 3, 4, 5). A life-table approach was used to analyze the ‘time to’ variables; statistical 
comparisons  were  made  using  log-rank  tests  (used  in  Objectives  No  6,  7).  Investigators  who 
contribute  fewer  than  5  patients  to  an  analysis  were  combined  in  a  separate  ‘investigator’  for  the 
analysis.  To  evaluate  resolution  of  investigator-assessed  GERD  symptoms  at  2  time  points,  a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used (Objective No 8). Overall treatment evaluation results were 
compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Objective No 9). 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  ITT  population  was  presented  descriptively  for 
gender, age group (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years), race, investigator, and H. pylori status (by histology). 
Safety:  No  inferential  statistics  were  used.  Adverse  events  and  medical/surgical  history  were 
classified  according  the  terminology  of  Astra  Adverse  Event  Dictionary  (AAED).  Incidence  rates  of 
adverse event were calculated by body system and preferred term.  
Safety  variables  including  clinical  laboratory  tests  and  vital  signs  for  the  3  treatment  groups  were 
presented  using  descriptive  statistics.  Descriptive  statistics  were  calculated  for  baseline,  final,  and 
change  from  baseline  values.  ‘Shift  tables’  presenting  the  frequencies  of  changes  from  within  to 
outside of normal limits were produced for each laboratory test. Frequencies of patients having one 
or  more  potentially  clinically  significant  results  for  each  laboratory  test  were  calculated  using 
predefined criteria. 
Handling  the  missing  data  and  dropouts:  If  a  diary  value  was  missing,  the  maximum  value  of  the 
closest  prior  and  post  diary  entries  was  assigned.  The  values  that  were  not  consistent  (eg,  missing 
severity, but heartburn = Yes) were imputted and then decision was made as to the appropriateness 
of  the  data  for  analysis  of  each  endpoint.  Patient  with  less  than  4  days  with  values  or  more than  2 
days of imputed values was either considered a non-responder (if there was sufficient data to qalify 
as a non-responder), or was excluded from the analysis. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Participants  flow.  In  study  225,  369/1021  patients  (36%)  were  randomized  compared  to  349/913 
patients  (38.2%)  in  study  226.  The  primary  reason  for  non-randomizing  screened  patients  was 
erosive  esophagitis  (EE)  positive  status.  Of  the  368  patients  enrolled  in  study  225,  344  patients 
(93.5%) completed the study and 24 patients (6.5%) discontinued from the study before completion, 
mainly  due  to  the  withdrawal  of  consent  (2.4%).  Three  patients  (0.8%)  discontinued  due  to  an  AE. 
Of  the  349  patients  enrolled  in  study  226,  320  patients  (91.7%)  completed  the  study,  and  29 
patients (8.3%) discontinued from the study before completion, mainly due to the occurrence of an 
AE (2.9%). Randomisation and discontinuation rates were comparable between the groups.

Recruitment 
Studies 225 and 226 recruitment was initiated in February 1999, completed in June 1999. 
Conduct of the study 
Treatment compliance was ~90% in all 3 treatment groups. No patients were excluded from the ITT 
population.  In  study  225,  22/368  patients  (6%)  were  excluded  from  PP  population,  mainly  due  to 
study  drug  compliance  (10/368,  2.7%),  medical  history  (7/368,  1.9%)  and  use  of  the  prohibited 
medications  prior  or  during  the  study  (4/368,  1.1%).  In  study  226,  31/349  patients  (8.9%)  were 
excluded  from  PP  population,  mainly  due  to  study  drug  compliance  (15/349,  4.3%)  and  use  of  the 
prohibited medications prior or during the study (8/349, 2%). Across the three treatment groups in 
each  study,  the  numbers  of  patients  excluded  were  comparable.  The  excluded  patients  are 
comparable between groups both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
Baseline data 
The patients were fairly balanced among the groups as regards the gender, age, race, body weight, 
height,  GERD  history,  heartburn,  acid  regurgitation,  dysphagia,  epigastric  pain,  H.  pylori  status 
(Table 10).

Numbers analysed 
The  numbers  of  the  ITT  population  used  for  all  primary  and  secondary  analyses,  the  PP  population 
used  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  the  SAF  population  for  safety  analyses  are  provided  in 
Table  9  above  (see  in  Sample  size  of  this  section).  Primary  analysis  is  performed  on  proper 
population (ITT).  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy parameters 
The  main  findings  of  studies  225  and  226  are  summarized  in  Table  2.  The  efficacy  results  of  both 
studies were comparable  
At the end of the study (last 7 days of treatment), esomeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg demonstrated a 
significantly better effect (p<0.001) compared to placebo regarding the number of patients to reach 
complete resolution of diary-recorded heartburn, in  both ITT and PP populations in both studies. So 
the primary objective was achieved.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  complete  resolution  by  the  end  of  Study  225  was  33.3%  (41/123), 
33.9% (41/121), and 13.7% (17/124) for treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg, esomeprazole 20 mg, 
and  placebo,  respectively.  In  study  226,  the  complete  resolution  was  achieved  in  36.4%  (43/118), 
41.6% (47/113) and 11.9% (14/118) of the patients, respectively. 
Secondary efficacy parameters 
Complete  resolution  of  heartburn  at  1,  2,  and  4  weeks  (diary  recorded):  Study  225:  significant 
difference  was  demonstrated  between  the  esomeprazole  40  mg  and  placebo  groups  (p<0.001),  as 
well  as  between  the  esomeprazole  20  mg  and  placebo  groups  (p<0.014)  at  each  of  the  three  time 
points.  At  Weeks  2  and  4,  the  frequencies  of  patients  responding  to treatment  in  the  esomeprazole 
40  mg  group  and  the  esomeprazole 20  mg group  are  similar  Study 226:  significant  difference  was 
demonstrated  between  the  esomeprazole  40  mg/  esomeprazole  20  mg  and  placebo  groups 
(p<0.001)  at  each  of  the  three  time  points.  The  majority  of  the  responders  achieved  complete 
resolution in the first 2 weeks.

Resolution  of  investigator-assessed  GERD  symptoms  at  week  2  and  week  4:  Study  225:  the 
resolution  results  of  heartburn  were  significantly  improved  for  esomeprazole  40  mg  and 
esomeprazole 20 mg compared to placebo at week 2 (p<0.001) and at week 4 (p≤0.003), as well as 
of  acid  regurgitation  at  week  2  (p≤  0.004)  and  at  week  4  (p≤0.001).  The  resolution  results  of 
dysphagia  and  epigastric  pain  were  not  significantly  improved  for  esomeprazole  40  mg  and 
esomeprazole  20  mg  compared  to  placebo  (see  Table  3).  Study  226:  the  resolution  results  of 
heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  were  significantly  improved  for  esomeprazole  40  mg  and 
esomeprazole 20 mg compared to placebo at week 2 and at week 4 (p<0.001). The resolution results 
of  dysphagia  were  not  significantly  improved  for  esomeprazole  40  mg  and  esomeprazole  20  mg 
compared to placebo as well as for epigastric pain at week 2, but were improved for epigastric pain at 
week 4 (p≤0.024) (see Table 3).

Time  to  first  resolution  of  heartburn  and  nocturnal  heartburn  (diary  recorded):  In  Study  225:  (1) 
the  time  to  first  resolution  of  heartburn  was  significantly  shorter  in  the  esomeprazole  40  mg  and 
esomeprazole  20  mg  groups  vs.  placebo  (p=0.008  and  0.003,  respectively).  See  Figure  3  for 
graphical  presentation  of  the  results.  For  esomeprazole  40  mg,  esomeprazole  20  mg,  and  placebo 
groups,  at  Day  7,  70.7%,  77.7%,  and  58.1%  of  patients,  respectively,  had  recorded  their  first 
resolution  of  heartburn  (see Table 12).  (2) The  time  to  first  resolution  of  nocturnal  heartburn  was 
not significantly different in the esomeprazole 40 mg and esomeprazole 20 mg groups compared to 
placebo group. Study 226: (1) the time to first resolution of heartburn was  significantly shorter in 
the esomeprazole 40 mg and esomeprazole 20 mg groups vs. placebo (p=0.001). See Figure 3 for 
graphical  presentation  of  the  results.  For  esomeprazole  40  mg,  esomeprazole  20  mg,  and  placebo 
groups,  at  Day  7,  72.0%,  77.9%,  and  51.7%  of  patients,  respectively,  had  recorded  their  first 
resolution  of  heartburn  (see  Table  12).  (2)  First  resolution  of  nocturnal  heartburn  occurred 
significantly  sooner  in  the  esomeprazole  40  mg  and  esomeprazole  20  mg  groups  compared  to 
placebo group (p=0.013 and 0.048, respectively).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup  analysis.  The  applicant  provided  descriptive  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  (complete 
resolution  of  heartburn  at  the  end  of  the  study)  for  the  ITT  population  for  the  following  subgroups: 
gender, age group (<65 years, ≥65 years), race, and H. pylori status (by histology) (see Table 16). 
Gender.  In  Study  225,  61%  of  patients  were  female  and  39%  were  male;  in  Study  226,  64%  of 
patients were female and 36% were male. In both studies male patients responded more favourably 
across all treatment groups, but the difference was not clinically meaningful. 
Age group. In Studies 225 and 226, 10% and 11% of patients, respectively, were ≥65 years of age. 
In  study  225,  a  lower  response  rate  was  observed  in  patients  ≥65  years  of  age  versus  those  <65 
years of age. In contrast, in study 226, a higher response rate was observed in patients ≥65 years 
of age versus those <65 years of age. However, the small numbers of patients ≥65 years of age in 
both studies make these rates difficult to interpret. 
Race.  In  both  studies,  only  a  small  number  of  patients  was  non-Caucasian:  51  (14%)  subjects  in 
Study 225 (9% Black, 2% Asian, and 2% Other) and 56 (16%) subjects in Study 226 (14% Black; 
1%  Asian;  1%  Other).  Therefore  any  interpretation  of  rates  of  heartburn  resolution  across  races  is 
difficult. 
H.  pylori  status.  About  one-third  of  the  patients  enrolled  in  Studies  225  and  226  were  H.  pylori-
positive at baseline (by histology) (39% and 27.9%, respectively). In the placebo group, there were 
a larger percentage of patients who experienced complete resolution of heartburn at the final visit for 
patients who were H. pylori positive at baseline as compared to those who were H. pylori -negative at 
baseline  (27.6%  vs.  8.5%  in  study  225,  respectively,  and  18.4%  vs.  8.8%  in  study  226, 
respectively). In the esomeprazole treatment groups, the rates for complete resolution of heartburn 
in H. pylori-positive patients were higher than those for H. pylori-negative patients.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy results after 4 weeks in patients with partial symptom relief at 2 weeks of treatment with 20 
mg  esomeprazole  in the  pooled pivotal  studies 225 and  226  (QBE-53  and –54)  are  displayed  below 
(see Table 4). 
Approximately  30%  of  partial  responders  achieved  complete  resolution  of  symptoms  following  an 
additional 2 weeks of treatment. The differences of success rates in comparison to placebo, are 25%-
30% in the first two weeks, and 10-14% in the following two weeks.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No new studies were performed for this application. The special populations as they are assessed in 
the original application can be considered as acceptable. 
Supportive studies 
The  pivotal  studies  were  performed  in  non-erosive  reflux  disease  (NERD)  patients;  patients  with 
erosive esophagitis were excluded from the study following baseline endoscopy. To mimick the non-
prescription  situation  of  esomeprazole  intended  with  the  application  where  patients  were  taking  the 
medication  without  prior  endoscopic  investigation  the  Applicant  presented  3  bibliographical  analyses 
(with 2 metanalyses) and 14 own studies data about several GERD populations that were considered 
as not tested in the same way as in pivotal studies but reasonable to expect as possible users of OTC 
esomeprazole  (1)  patients  having  esophageal  erosions  and  (2)  patients  without  baseline  endoscopy 
and  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  reflux  symptom  frequency,  severity  and  duration  (e.g.,  patients  with 
history of heartburn for at least 6 months and with prior symptomatic response to acid suppression, 
patients having night-time hearthburn, sleep disturbances and just seeking for the treatment at the 
general practitioner). 
Literature Analyses: 
(1)  Kahrilas  PJ  et  al  200018  study  of  erosive  esophagitis  (EE)  was  a  A  double-blind  randomized, 
comparative  study  including  Eso  40mg,  20mg  and  Omeprazole  20mg  for  4-8  weeks  (to  healing)  in 
patients 18-75 years of age with GERD symptoms and a positive endoscopy, (LA grade A-D), at least 
1w  before  inclusion;  Negative  for  Helicobacter pylori  and  No  Barrett’s  mucosa >3cm.  Study  showed 
symptom resolution by sustained resolution (Investigator): At 4w: Eso 40mg: 65%; Eso 20mg: 61%; 
Ome  20mg:  57%  ,  (p<0,005  Eso  40mg  vs  Ome  20mg;  ns  Eso20mg  vs  Ome  20mg);  Cumulative 
sustained resolution (Patient diary): At 2w: Eso 40mg: 65%; Eso 20mg: 63%; Ome 20mg: 57% At

4w:  Eso  40mg:  74%;  Eso  20mg:  70%;  Ome  20mg:  67%;  Healing  of  erosions:  At  4w-  Eso  40mg: 
76%; Eso 20mg:71%; Ome 20mg:65% (p< 0,001 Eso 40mg vs Ome 20mg and p<0.09 Eso 20mg vs 
Ome 20mg); At 8w (cumulative)- Eso 40mg: 94%; Eso 20mg:90%; Ome 20mg:87% ( p<0,001 Eso 
40mg  vs  Ome  20mg;  p<0,05Eso  20  vs  Ome  20mg).  Thus  conclusion  was  made  that  Eso  40 mg  qd 
and  20  mg  qd  are  safe  and  effective  treatments  for  healing  of  EE,  and  significantly  superior  to 
omeprazole 20 mg qd in the primary efficacy analysis, healing of EE following 4 weeks to 8 weeks of 
treatment.  Esomeprazole  was  well  tolerated  with  no  unexpected  findings  and  consistent  with  the 
known safety profile of esomeprazole ‘ 
(2)  Weijenborg  et  al  201219  metaanalysis  includes  randomized  clinical  trials  in  patients  with  NERD 
and  reflux  esophagitis  that  evaluated  the  effect  of  short-term  PPI  treatment  on  heartburn.  The 
proportion of individuals achieving complete relief of heartburn after 4 weeks of PPI therapy was 0.50 
(0.43–0.57)  in  the  8  studies  with  uninvestigated  empirically  treated  patients  (without  any 
endoscopy),  0.49  (0.44–0.55)  in  the  12  studies  were  patients  were  defined  as  non-erosive  by 
negative endoscopy, 0.73 (0.69–0.77) in the 2 studies where patients were defined as nonerosive by 
both negative endoscopy and a positive pH-test and it was 0.72 (95% CI 0.69–0.74) in patients with 
reflux  esophagitis  (32  studies).  The  Applicant  states  that  results  support  that  the  effect  of  PPI  on 
symptoms  is  similar  in  uninvestigated  patients  treated  empirically  (as  in  the  OTC  setting)  to  the 
patients diagnosed as NERD based on negative endoscopy (as in the pivotal studies). It also supports 
that in reflux esophagitis patients the estimated complete symptom response rate after PPI therapy is 
higher  than  in  patients  with  GERD  independent  if  it  is  diagnosed  by  symptoms  and  negative 
endoscopy or by symptoms alone. 
(3) The van Pinxteren et al 201020 metaanalysis demonstrated that the benefit of PPI vs. placebo was 
greater  in  studies  in  uninvestigated  GERD  patients  than  in  studies  with  endoscopy  verified  NERD 
patients.  Therefore  it  was  assumed  that  if  esomeprazole  is  effective  and  well  tolerated  in  NERD 
patients (QBE-53, -54), then it will be at least as effective in uninvestigated patients that includes a 
mixture  of  erosive  and  non-erosive  patients.  The  safety  profile  was  described  as  similar  in  studies 
including either patients with or without esophageal erosions. 
Randomized, double blind comparative studies: 
(1-2) Two, almost identically designed, studies D961AC00001 and D9612L00122 represent a special 
subgroup  of  uninvestigated  reflux  patients  i.e.  those  who  have  night-time  heartburn  and  sleep 
disturbances.  The  studies  included  950  US  patients  having  at  least  a  3  month  history  of  GERD 
including frequent night-time heartburn (2-3/week) with related sleep disturbances and moderate or 
severe  night-time  heartburn  with  sleep  disturbances  at  least  3  of  the  last  week  prior  to 
randomization. The patients in the two studies were randomized to receive esomeprazole (20 and 40 
mg in study D961AC00001, and 20 mg in study D9612L00122) and placebo, all for 4 weeks. Patients 
symptoms were evaluated after 2 and 4 weeks, using diary cards (symptom relief defined as max 1 
day with mild symptoms last week).  
Results:  nighttime  heartburn  relief  (a)  in  Study  D961AC00001:  Eso  40mg:  53.1%,  Eso  20  mg: 
50.5% , placebo: 12.7% (p < 0.0001); (b) in Study D961AC00122: Eso 20 mg: 34.3% vs. placebo: 
10.4% (p < 0.0001). Thus the evaluation of 24h heartburn relief is comparable with the results in the 
pivotal studies. The treatment was well tolerated in this uninvestigated patient population.

(3-4) The two identical phase III randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies 
D961RC00001 and D961RC00002 were recently conducted in the US. According to the applicant the 
design  of  the  studies  was  similar  to  previously  conducted  registration  trials  for  this  indication 
performed for other PPIs in the US and it is in accordance with FDA’s expectation to include subjects 
who  are  likely  to  self-treat  for  frequent  heartburn  with  nonprescription  medications  without 
consulting  a  prescriber.  Approximately  340  patients  were  randomized  in  each  study.  The  primary 
objective of the studies was to determine the efficacy of esomeprazole 20 mg once daily over a 14-
day regimen for the treatment of frequent heartburn (≥2 times a week).  
Results: percentage  heartburn  free  24  hour  day  (LS  mean) Study  01:  Eso  20  mg  46,1%  ,  placebo: 
33% (p < 0.0001); Study 02::Eso 20 mg: 48% vs. placebo: 33% (p < 0.0001). Thus, esomeprazole 
was  significantly  more  effective  than  placebo.  Esomeprazole  treatment  was  generally  well  tolerated 
and there were no new or significant findings with regard to safety. 
(5) In a double blind, randomized study (D9612L00064) 369 US patients with a history of heartburn 
for at least 6 months and with prior symptomatic response to acid suppression were included without 
baseline  endoscopy.  The  requirement  for  a  positive esophageal  acid  perfusion  test  aimed  to include 
patients whose symptoms were most likely related to acid reflux. Patients were randomized to either 
esomeprazole  20  mg  od,  40  mg  od  or  40  mg  bid.  Symptoms  were  evaluated  using  diaries  after  4 
weeks.  
Results: Mean % of sustained resolution of HB: 20mg 48%; 40mg 44% ; 40mg bid 41%; Mean % of 
patients  with  HB  relief:  20mg  59%  ;  40mg  52%  ;  40mg  bid  54%;  Cumulative  daily  sustained 
resolution  rate:  20  mg  62.8%;  40mg  52.0%;  40  mg  bid  62.0%;  Mean  number  of  days  to  the  first 
day of the first 7-day period of sustained resolution: 20 mg 14.7; 40mg 14.0; 40 mg bid 15.5; Mean 
number of days to the first day of the first 7-day period of relief: 20 mg 12.1; 40mg 12.5; 40 mg bid 
12.9;  Mean % of  heartburn-free  days:  20  mg  66.5%;  40mg  62.4%;  40  mg bid 67.8%;  Mean %  of 
heartburn-free nights: 20 mg 80.8%; 40mg 78.0%; 40 mg bid 88.2%. The results show that each of 
the treatment doses of esomeprazole to a similar extent decreased reflux symptoms in comparison to 
baseline. All treatments were well tolerated in this uninvestigated patient population. 
Open label studies:  
To  further  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  esomeprazole  in  a  large  segment  of  uninvestigated 
reflux patients the applicant presented seven studies in uninvestigated patients without any baseline 
endoscopy  and  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  reflux  symptom  frequency  and  severity,  seeking  for 
treatment  at  the  general  practitioner  from  many  different  countries  in  Europe.  The  studies  were  all 
designed to have two parts, an initial 4 week part and a second maintenance part. 
(1-2)  In  two  studies  (D9612L00109,  D9612L00111)  a  total  of  3133  uninvestigated  patients 
consulting a general practitioner for symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux, as judge by the 
investigator,  were  investigated.  During  the  initial  non-blinded  period  all  patients  were  treated  with 
either  esomeprazole  20  mg  or  40  mg.  After  4  weeks  treatment  the  patients  symptoms  were 
evaluated  according  to  the  endpoint  of  this  phase  (max  1  or  2  days  of  mild  symptom  last  week). 
Symptom  free  patients  were  then  randomized  into  the  second  maintenance  phase  given  either 
esomeprazole  20  mg od  or  20  mg  on-demand  or  antacids  during  12  weeks. Results  from  the  initial 
period is applicable here.

At  4  weeks:  20mg  Eso:  Treatment  success:  86%  40mg  Eso:  Treatment  success:  80%  In  20+40mg 
(total): 85%. The results from the initial study part demonstrated a decrease in reflux symptoms in 
comparison  to  baseline,  without  a    significant  difference  between  the  20  mg  and  40  mg  doses.  In 
these  studies  esomeprazole  was  well  tolerated  with  no  unexpected  findings  and  consistent  with  the 
known safety profile of esomeprazole.  
(3-7)  In  a  group  of  five  similar  studies  (ACH-QBE-0101,  CR  BU-NEG-0005,  IE-ESO-0001,  CBNEG-
0001,  LH-NEG-0020)  in  a  total  of  7721  uninvestigated  patients  seeking  primary  care  for  symptoms 
suggestive  of  gastroesophageal  reflux  for  at  least  three  days  during  the  last  seven  days  were 
investigated. During the initial non-blinded period all patients were treated with esomeprazole 40 mg. 
After 4weeks treatment the patients symptoms were evaluated to the endpoint of this phase (max 1 
day  mild  symptom  last  week).  In  the  second  maintenance  part  of  the  study  patients  free  from 
symptoms were randomized to either esomeprazole 20mg as continuous treatment or as on-demand 
treatment for 6 months. Results from the initial period is applicable here.

SAEs, deemed unrelated to study drug. Results from the initial study part show substantial decrease 
of  reflux  symptoms  in  comparison  to  baseline.  Esomeprazole  treatments  were  well  tolerated, 
consistent with the known safety profile of esomeprazole. 
Non comparative studies 
Studies  D9914C00002  and  GB-QBE-001  evaluated both  patients  with  and without  erosions,  the  two 
usual  subpopulations  within  the  uninvestigated  reflux  population.  In  these  two  studies  the  patients 
were endoscoped at baseline however all patients were treated and evaluated irrespectively of if they 
had erosions or not and together they could mimic the uninvestigated population. 
(1) The D9914C00002 (Diamond study) included 308 patients seeking primary care consultation for 
upper abdominal symptoms persistent at least 2 times/week for 4 weeks and three or more occasions 
with  at  least  mild  symptoms  last  week.  The  great  majority  of  patients  had  reflux  symptoms  as  the 
most bothersome symptoms, although in addition other upper GI symptoms were often presented as 
well.  The  design  included  sequentially  two  single  blinded  2  week  study  periods  with  placebo  and 
esomeprazole  40  mg  respectively.  Symptom  evaluations  were  done  using  patient  reported outcome 
measurements. Further, an endoscopy, a pH test and questionnaires were performed but the results 
were blinded to the patients during the study.  
Results: Based on all data 66% of the patients were defined as having GERD; At 4 week Response to 
PPI (40mg) - 48% of all patients ; group response: EE 57%, NERD 49%, non-GERD 35%, p<0,1 EE 
vs  non-GERD  Placebo  response  total  13%  (GERD  13%,  non-GERD  14%);  The  pattern  of  heartburn 
relief  was  similar  to  other  studies  in  patients  with  or  without  GERD  diagnosis  confirming  the 
applicability  of  esomeprazole  treatment  in  patient  populations  when  no  endoscopy  is  performed

before treatment initiation like in the OTC patient group. Esomeprazole was well tolerated, consistent 
with the known safety profile of esomeprazole. 
(2) In the GB-QBE-001 (ProGERD) study 6509 patients in Germany, Switzerland and Austria referred 
to  endoscopy  due  to  reflux  symptoms.  Open  treatment  with  esomeprazole  was  allocated  based  on 
the  result  of  the  endoscopy,  40  mg  for  4-8  weeks  for  patients  with  reflux  esophagitis  and  20  mg 
during 2-4weeks in NERD patients. Symptoms were evaluated by the endpoint of complete symptom 
resolution  (no  symptom  last  week)  after  2  weeks  for  all  patients,  after  4  weeks  in  all  patients  with 
erosions  and  in  non-erosive  patients  with  persistent  symptoms  at  2  weeks,  and  after  8  weeks  in 
patient that still had erosions at 4 weeks.  
Results:  Efficacy:  Symptom  resolution:  At  2weeks  Complete  resolution  of  heartburn:  61%  of  EE 
patients (40mg); 59% of NERD patients (20mg); At last visit Complete resolution of heartburn: 70% 
of  EE  patients  and  65%  of  NERD  patients;  Healing  EE:  At  4weeks:  78%  healed;  At  8weeks:  88% 
healed. High level results demonstrated decrease in reflux symptoms, in comparison to baseline, but 
without a significant difference between 20 mg and 40 mg (at 2 weeks). An increased proportion of 
patients  reached  symptom  relief  after  4  weeks  compared  to  after  2  weeks.  Esomeprazole  was  well 
tolerated with no unexpected findings and consistent with the known safety profile of esomeprazole. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the pivotal studies (QBE 0053 (study 225) and QBE 0054 (study 226)), the safety and efficacy of 4 
weeks’  treatment  with  esomeprazole  20 mg  or  40 mg  with  regard  to  reflux  symptoms  (heart  burn 
and  acid  regurgitation)  was  studied.  These  two  phase  III  pivotal  studies  were  of  identical  design. 
Both  of  them  were  continental  USA,  placebo-controlled,  randomized  (1:1:1),  double-blind,  multi-
center, parallel-group, 4-week, efficacy and safety studies of esomeprazole 20 mg and esomeprazole 
40 mg vs. placebo in patients with symptomatic GERD. Subjects selected to the studies had at least a 
6-month  history  of  heartburn,  were  negative  for  erosive  oesophagitis  at  endoscopy  (non-erosive 
reflux disease (NERD) patients) and reported at least 4 days with heartburn in the week prior to the 
inclusion.  Both  studies  were  properly  sized,  no  protocol  amendments  were  issued  for  both  studies 
and there were no changes made to the analyses specified in the Data Analysis Plan completed prior 
to the data being unblinded.  
The  effect  was  assessed  by  patient  daily  diary  heartburn  scoring  and  by  investigator-recorded 
symptoms  scoring.  Patient  symptom  scoring  (self-assessment  of  symptom  frequency  and  severity 
with help of a questionnaire) has been widely used in clinical studies and recognized as a useful aid 
for the diagnosis of reflux disease. Efficacy data are based on proper ITT population (all randomized 
patients, defined prior to unblinding the data) assessing primarily the rate of complete resolution of 
heartburn for the last 7 days in the study based on the data from the last available 7-day period on 
the diary card. Patients are fairly balanced among the groups as regards the gender, age, race, body 
weight,  height,  GERD  history,  heartburn,  acid  regurgitation,  dysphagia,  epigastric  pain,  H.  pylori 
status. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Only  the  data  for  the  20-mg  dosing  are  relevant  for  the  present  application.  The  proportion  of 
patients with complete resolution by the end of Study 225 was 33.9% (41/121) and 13.7% (17/124) 
for  treatment  with  esomeprazole  20  mg,  and  placebo,  respectively.  In  study  226,  the  complete 
resolution was achieved in 41.6% (47/113) and 11.9% (14/118) of the patients, respectively. At the 
end of the study (last 7 days of treatment), esomeprazole 20 mg demonstrated a significantly better 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 47/70 
 
  
  
effect (p<0.001) compared to placebo regarding the number of patients to reach complete resolution 
of  diary-recorded  heartburn,  in  both  ITT  and  PP  populations  in  both  studies.  Therefore,  the  primary 
objective  was  achieved.  This  primary  endpoint  was  further  supported  by  the  majority  of  secondary 
efficacy parameters. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  pivotal  studies  were  performed  in  non-erosive  reflux  disease  (NERD) 
patients  and  that  more  than  half  of  the  screened  patients  were  not  eligible  for  the  studies  due  to 
“silent”  erosions.  To  elaborate  the  effects  of  esomeprazole  in  case  of  the  non-prescription  setting 
where  patients  were  taking  the  medication  without  prior  endoscopic  investigation  (i.e.  in  patients 
with  reflux  esophagitis  as  well  as  in  other  GERD  subpopulations  in  un-investigated  patients),  the 
applicant presented 3 bibliographical analyses (with 2 meta-analyses) and 14 own studies with data 
about  several  investigated  and  un-investigated  populations  with  reflux  symptoms.  The  results  from 
these studies were comparable to the results from the pivotal studies in terms of showing an effect of 
esomeprazole  on  symptom  relief  in  patients  with  heartburn  and/or  acid  regurgitation  with  a  similar 
safety  profile  as  shown  with  esomeprazole  in  the  prescription  drug  development.  Based  on  this 
review  the  CHMP  agrees  on  the  extrapolation  of  the  pivotal  study  results  to  the  patient  population 
who will obtain a PPI as non-prescription medicine. 
As  a  general  principle  for  non-prescription  medicines  and  particularly  in  the  context  of  the  indirect 
danger of having a more serious underlying condition that needs medical attention present in partial 
responders,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  treatment  duration  should  be  adequately  limited  in  an  OTC 
setting. According to the pivotal studies efficacy was shown already at week 2 for two variables (% of 
patients  with  complete  resolution  of  heartburn  and  %  of  patients  with  relief  of  heartburn). 
Furthermore, time (days) to first resolution of heartburn and nocturnal heartburn was 6.6 and 2 for 
Study  225  and  5.8  and  1.6  for  Study  226.  Time  (days)  for  sustained  resolution  of  heartburn  and 
nocturnal heartburn was 17.3 and 7.2 for Study 225 and 12.7 and 6.2 for Study 226. 
To justify the claim of the additional two weeks (i.e. a maximum of 4 weeks in partial responders) the 
Applicant  reviewed  efficacy  results  in  patients  with  partial  symptom  relief  at  2  weeks  of  treatment 
with  20  mg  esomeprazole  in  the  pooled  pivotal  studies  225  and  226  (QBE-53  and  –54).  Between 
29%  -  32%  (depending  on  the  definitions  of  symptom  resolution  [i.e.,  investigator  assessed 
resolution  (no  symptoms  during  the  last  week),  or  daily  diary  card  of  partial  responders  achieved 
complete  resolution  of  symptoms  following  an  additional  2  weeks  of  treatment.  However,  the 
differences of success rates in comparison to placebo were 25%-30% in the first two weeks, and only 
10-14% in the following two weeks. The NNT (Number needed to treat) in the second two weeks is 
therefore  considered  to  be  clearly  diminished.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  treatment 
duration  should  be limited  to  two  weeks  and  that  the  product information  should  indicate  that  if  no 
symptom relief is obtained within 2 weeks of continuous treatment, the patient should be instructed 
to  consult  a  doctor.  The  CHMP  also  noted  that  this  is  in  line  with  the  recommendation  for  the  non-
prescription  medicine  containing  omeprazole,  the  parent  compound  of  esomeprazole,  in  the  same 
indication. 
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant has presented the relevant efficacy data which shows that esomeprazole is effective in 
GERD when compared to placebo and that resolution rates with the 20mg dose are clinically relevant. 
This  is  further  supported  by  post  approval  data  gathered  from  the  meta-analyses  and  studies 
presented bridging the results of the pivotal studies to the uninvestigated patient population who will 
seek OTC PPI medication.

With regards to the initially claimed posology (2 weeks of treatment and additional 2 weeks in partial 
responders) the CHMP was of the view that it is to be taken into consideration that good efficacy is 
shown  already  after  2  weeks  and  only  numerical  improvement  in  partial  responders  achieving 
complete  resolution  of  symptoms  following  an  additional  2  weeks  of  treatment  could  be  shown. 
Therefore,  the  treatment  duration  should  be  limited  to  two  weeks  and  that  the  product  information 
should  indicate  that  if  no  symptom  relief  is  obtained  within  2 weeks  of  continuous  treatment,  the 
patient should be instructed to consult a doctor. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As  of  31  August  2011,  oral  esomeprazole  is  estimated  to  have  a  cumulative  exposure  of 
approximately 70.5 million patient-years worldwide since first approval. 
In addition more than 90 000 patients/subjects were exposed to esomeprazole in clinical trials as of 
10 September 2011 (see Table 19).  
Table 19 Esomeprazole exposure (all clinical trial populations)  
The  safety  population  in  the  submitted  two  pivotal  studies  (470  patients)  is  presented  below  to  be 
regarded as supportive. 
In  the  pooled  safety  population  of  studies  225  and  226  a  total  of  710  subjects  with  diagnosis  of 
symptomatic  GERD  were included.  Of  these,  240  received  placebo  and  470  received treatment  with 
esomeprazole; 232 patients were exposed to the proposed dose range (20 mg) of esomeprazole, the 
others  (238)  to  esomeprazole  40  mg.  Of  the  717  randomized  patients,  7  patients  did  not  have  a 
documented dose  of  study  medication  and  were  therefore  excluded  from the  safety  population.  The 
pooled  mean  exposure  was  28  days.  For  this  application  the  safety  analyses  were  performed  using 
the safety population, which included all randomized patients treated with at least one dose of study 
medication  (esomeprazole  or  placebo)  and  for  whom  post-dose  data  were  available.  Treatment 
groups  were  generally  well  balanced  with  respect  to  all  demographic  characteristics.  Demographic 
distribution is representative to EU population. 
Adverse events 
As  of  31  August  2011  the  applicant  had,  in  total,  obtained  approximately  51000  spontaneously 
reported  case  reports  concerning  AEs  (both  serious  and  non-serious)  from  post-marketing 
experiences  (including  reports  from  consumers  and  Patient  Assistance  Programs)  of  esomeprazole 
around the world. 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013

The  10  most  commonly  reported  AEs  were  drug  dose  omission,  drug  ineffective,  diarrhoea, 
headache,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  nausea,  abdominal  pain  upper,  dyspepsia,  malaise  and 
abdominal pain. In the reports of drug dose omission (that the patients do not take their medication 
regularly,  eg,  due  to  cost)  approximately  one  third  of  the  patients  also  reported  gastroesophageal 
reflux disease. Other commonly reported events in the reports of drug dose omission were dyspepsia, 
malaise, vomiting, abdominal pain upper and drug ineffective. 
In the pivotal studies overall, 285/710 patients (40%) experienced at least 1 AE. The rate of subjects 
reporting  AEs  was  following:  esomeprazole  40  mg  (42%),  20  mg  (38.8%),  placebo  (39.6%).  There 
were no apparent differences between the esomeprazole treatment groups and the placebo group in 
the  proportions  of  patients  reporting  at  least  one  AE  or  in  the  proportions  of  patients  reporting  a 
serious AE. There were no deaths in the studies. Relatively few patients discontinued treatment due 
to an AE (see Table 6). 
Table 6. Summary of AEs (studies 225 and 226, pooled data).  
The most common AEs were in the GI disorders SOC, overall (154/710, 21%) and in each treatment 
group.  The  frequency  of  GI  disorder  AEs  was  higher  in  the  esomeprazole  groups  compared  with

placebo,  but  AEs  increase  with  dose  was  not  observed:  esomeprazole  40  mg  (22.3%),  20  mg 
(24.6%), placebo (18.3%).  
The  most  common  AE  by  preferred  term  was  headache,  reported  in  5.5%  of  esomeprazole  40  mg 
patients,  7.8%  of  esomeprazole  20  mg  patients,  and  7.5%  of  placebo  patients.  The  following  the 
most  frequent  AEs  were  of  GI  disorders  SOC  (abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea  and  nausea)  and  were 
reported at a slightly higher frequency in the esomeprazole 20 mg group compared to esomeprazole 
40 mg and placebo groups.  
In  the  pivotal  studies,  31%  of  the  subjects  experienced  any  AE  during  the  first  2  weeks  of 
esomeprazole  treatment  compared  to  15%  during  Day  15-28  of  treatment.  The  proportion  of 
subjects  with  any  AE  was  similar  to  those  in  the  placebo  group.  No  SAEs  were  recorded  in  the 
esomeprazole treatment group (Table 6). 
The percentage of related AEs as judged by the investigator were  higher in the esomeprazole groups 
in  the  pooled  pivotal  studies,  the  relative  difference  was  bigger  in  the  second  2  weeks  in  pooled 
pivotal studies (~7% and 3% vs. ~16% and 13% for esomeprazole and placebo). The larger data set 
consisting of 13 pooled studies presented in table 7 below no such pattern is seen.  
In pooled data from 13 clinical studies with 20 mg esomeprazole treatment 16% of the subjects had 
any AE during the first 2 weeks of treatment while 0.6% of the subjects had any SAE. During Day 15-
28 of treatment 12% the subjects had any AE and 0.6% of the subjects had any SAE (Table 7).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths. No deaths were reported in Study 225 and Study 226.  
Serious AE other than deaths. In total, 5 serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in studies 225 and 226. 
All SAEs were single events. The most frequent SAEs were GI disorders SOC (2 subjects) and myo-
endo-pericardial & valve disorders SOC (2 events occurred in one patient). 
In general serious or severe AEs and interactions following administration of esomeprazole are rare. 
All identified adverse drug reactions are included in the Product information. Details of all important 
identified risks and all potential risks with esomeprazole are presented in the RMP.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology  and  clinical  chemistry:  Baseline  values  for  all  variables  in  Study  225  and  Study  226 
were similar between treatment groups. Mean changes were small and similar across three treatment 
groups  in  each  study.  Expected  dose-related  mean  changes  in  serum  gastrin  were  found  in  both 
studies.  Isolated  values  outside  reference  range  were  found  in  both  studies,  but  findings  weren’t 
statistically significant. Laboratory findings did not raise any additional issues for esomeprazole. 
Agranulocytosis  is  included  in  the  SmPCs  for  esomeprazole  and  the  frequency  is  considered  to  be 
very  rare,  <1/10000.    No  cases  have  been  reported  within  the  applicant’s  clinical  programme.  In 
total 128 medically confirmed AEs of agranulocytosis had been received up to 10 September 2012. Of 
these,  127  were  serious  and  1  was  non-serious  from  marketed  use.  The  risk  of  Agranulocytosis  is 
reflected  in  the  RMP.  Hypomagnesaemia  is  included  in  the  SmPCs  for  esomeprazole  and  the 
frequency  has  been  estimated  to  ‘not  known’.    No  cases  have  been  reported  within  the  applicant’s 
clinical programme. In total 66 medically confirmed AEs of hypomagnesaemia had been received as 
of 10 September 2012.  Of these, 36 were serious and 29 were non-serious from marketed use, and 
1 was an SAE from an AstraZeneca sponsored clinical trial. 
Safety in special populations 
See also pharmacology part of this report above. 
Elderly 
The  safety  events  for  elderly  patients  from  pooled  data  from  24  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies 
with  esomeprazole  comprising  9877  patients  treated  with  esomeprazole  and  5551  patients  treated 
with placebo was presented by age groups. The number of patients in the age group >65 was 2851 
and 1637 for esomeprazole and placebo respectively. See Table 2.  
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 54/70 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The  AE  rates  were  evenly  distributed  across  all  age  groups  and  the  overall  AE  profile  is  similar  for 
esomeprazole and placebo, with headache, nausea and diarrhoea being the most commonly reported.  
Paediatric population 
Esomeprazole is not foreseen to be used in the non-prescription setting in the paediatric population 
below 18 years of age.  
Pregnancy and Lactation 
A  moderate  amount  of  data  on  pregnant  women  (between  300-1000  pregnancy  outcomes)  indicate 
no  malformative  or  feto/  neonatal  toxicity  of  esomeprazole.  Provided  data  from  the  Swedish  birth 
registry showed a 1.7% rate of congenital malformations in case of esomeprazole that is in the range 
of  background  rate  of  ~2.8%  reported  in  the  literature.  As  a  precoutionary  measure  the  product 
information states that use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Medicinal products with pH dependent absorption 
Gastric acid suppression during treatment with esomeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
might  decrease  or  increase  the  absorption  of  medicinal  products  with  a  gastric  pH  dependent 
absorption.  As  with  other  medicinal  products  that  decrease  intragastric  acidity,  the  absorption  of 
medicinal  products  such  as  ketoconazole,  itraconazole  and  erlotinib  can  decrease  during  treatment 
with  esomeprazole  and  the  absorption  of  digoxin  can  increase  during  treatment  with  esomeprazole. 
Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the 
bioavailability  of  digoxin  by  10%  (up  to  30%  in  two  out  of  ten  subjects).  Digoxin  toxicity  has  been 
rarely reported.

Antiretroviral drugs 
Omeprazole has been reported to interact with some protease inhibitors. The clinical importance and 
the  mechanisms  behind  these  reported  interactions  are  not  always  known.  Increased  gastric  pH 
during  omeprazole  treatment  may  change  the  absorption  of  the  protease  inhibitors.  Other  possible 
interaction mechanisms are via inhibition of CYP2C19. For atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum 
levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole.  
Due  to  the  similar  pharmacodynamic  effects  and  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  omeprazole  and 
esomeprazole,  concomitant  administration  with  esomeprazole  and  atazanavir  is  not  recommended 
and concomitant administration with esomeprazole and nelfinavir is contraindicated. 
Drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 
Esomeprazole  inhibits  CYP2C19,  the  major  esomeprazole  metabolising  enzyme.  Thus,  when 
esomeprazole  is  combined  with  drugs  metabolised  by  CYP2C19,  such  as  diazepam,  citalopram, 
imipramine,  clomipramine,  phenytoin  etc.,  the  plasma  concentrations  of  these  drugs  may  be 
increased and a dose reduction could be needed.  
Interaction  with  clopidogrel  and  submitted  studies  has  been  described  in  the  pharmacology  part  of 
this report. 
Unknown mechanism 
As reflected in the SmPC, when given together with PPIs, methotrexate levels have been reported to 
increase  in  some  patients.  In  high-dose  methotrexate  administration  a  temporary  withdrawal  of 
esomeprazole may need to be considered. 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole 
Esomeprazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of esomeprazole 
and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d), resulted in a doubling of the exposure (AUC) 
to esomeprazole. Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 
and  CYP  3A4  may  result  in  a  more  than  doubling  of  the  esomeprazole  exposure.  The  CYP2C19  and 
CYP3A4  inhibitor  voriconazole  increased  omeprazole  AUCt  by  280%.  A  dose  adjustment  of 
esomeprazole is not regularly required in either of these situations. However, dose adjustment should 
be considered in patients with concomitant severe hepatic impairment. 
Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampicin and St. John’s wort) may lead 
to decreased esomeprazole serum levels by increasing the esomeprazole metabolism. 
2.5.1.  Post marketing experience 
Esomeprazole  is  currently  not  approved  for  non-prescription  use  hence  there  is  no  post-marketing 
experience. However, the parent compound omeprazole is approved and marketed for use in the OTC 
setting.  To  give  further  assurance  on  the  issue  of  incorrect  self-assessment  the  Applicant  provided 
post marketing data on the adverse event profile of non-prescription omeprazole, including the type 
of reports received and about changes in the type of events following non-prescription availability in 
the US. 
In Table 2 the 15 most commonly reported AE MedDRA PTs for PRILOSEC OTC, omeprazole Rx pre-
launch of PRILOSEC OTC and omeprazole Rx post-launch of PRILOSEC are shown (data derived from 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 56/70 
 
  
  
 
AstraZeneca safety database SAPPHIRE). The percentage of the total number of AE Preferred terms 
is also displayed. 
'Drug  ineffective'  is  the  most  commonly  reported  AE  for  both  PRILOSEC  OTC  and  omeprazole  Rx 
(both  pre  and  post  launch  of  PRILOSEC  OTC).  The  AE  term  'drug  ineffective'  for  Rx  constitutes  a 
much higher percentage post launch than pre-launch of PRILOSEC OTC. The percentage reported for 
'drug  ineffective'  for  PRILOSEC  OTC  (13.8)  is  comparable  with  the  percentage  for  Rx  post-launch 
(17.8), which could indicate a change in the overall reporting pattern. As shown in Table 2 a majority 
of  the  15  most  commonly  reported  AEs  in  each  group  are  either  listed  (entered  with  italic  font  in 
Table 2) in the 
Company  Core  Data  Sheet  for  omeprazole  and/or  likely  related  to  the  background  disease  (entered 
with  bolded  font  in  Table  2).  Overall  no  significant  difference  between  the  patterns  of  ADR  reports 
for prescription and non-prescription omeprazole can be seen. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As  of  31  August  2011,  oral  esomeprazole  is  estimated  to  have  a  cumulative  exposure  of 
approximately  70.5  million  patient-years  worldwide  since  first  approval.  The  exposure  of 
esomeprazole  in  clinical  trials  exceeding  the  90  000  patients/subjects  in  clinical  trials  makes  robust 
database to argue for risk profiling in general.  
The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  identified  or  suspected  in  the  clinical  trials  programme  for 
esomeprazole and post-marketing of ADRs are mild and transient in nature, the most frequent being 
headache  and  gastrointestinal  disorders,  ie,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  flatulence,  nausea/vomiting 
and constipation. No dose-related adverse reactions have been identified. 
Accordingly  the  most  common  AE  by  preferred  term  in  the  pooled  pivotal  trials  was  headache,  and 
the  following  most  frequent  AEs  were  of  GI  disorders  SOC  (abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea  and  nausea) 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 57/70 
 
  
  
 
 
reported at a slightly higher frequency in the esomeprazole 20 mg group compared to esomeprazole 
40 mg and placebo groups. 
AE  rates  from  a  pool  of  placebo  controlled  studies  comprising  9877  patients  treated  with 
esomeprazole  and  5551  patients  treated  with  placebo  are  evenly  distributed  across  all  age  groups 
and  the  overall  AE  profile  is  similar  for  esomeprazole  and  placebo,  with  headache,  nausea  and 
diarrhoea being the most commonly reported. 
To better profile the safety findings between the 2nd and 4th week of treatment a comparative safety 
analysis, both in pooled clinical studies with esomeprazole and in the pivotal studies was performed. 
Both  analyses  demonstrate  fewer  adverse  events  during  Day  15-28  of  treatment  compared  to  the 
first  2  weeks  of  treatment.  In  total,  serious  and  severe  AE  were  comparable  to  placebo  during  the 
second two weeks. Overall the safety profile shown in these analyses was considered not to be worse 
as compared to the first two weeks. 
The applicant provided information on interactions in line with the approved SmPC for the reference 
product.  Gastric  acid  suppression  during  treatment  with  esomeprazole  and  other  proton  pump 
inhibitors  (PPIs)  might  decrease  or  increase  the  absorption  of  medicinal  products  with  a  gastric  pH 
dependent  absorption.  When  esomeprazole  is  combined  with  drugs  metabolised  by  CYP2C19,  the 
major  esomeprazole  metabolising  enzyme,  the  plasma  concentrations  of  these  drugs  may  be 
increased and a dose reduction could be needed. 
Further, Omeprazole has been reported to interact with some protease inhibitors. Due to the similar 
pharmacodynamic  effects  and  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  omeprazole  and  esomeprazole, 
concomitant administration with esomeprazole and atazanavir is not recommended and concomitant 
administration with esomeprazole and nelfinavir is contraindicated. 
The  identified  and  potential  interactions  which  have  been  considered  as  the  most  important  due  to 
e.g.,  a  narrow  therapeutic  range  and/or  risk  for  serious  complications  are  reflected  appropriately  in 
the  RMP.  All  known  interactions  are  listed  in  the  SmPC/Package  Leaflet  and  the  risk  is  considered 
adequately balanced for OTC use. 
Post  marketing  data  provided  by  the  applicant  on  the  adverse  event  profile  of  non-prescription 
omeprazole demonstrate that there is no significant difference between the patterns of ADR reports 
for  prescription  and  non-prescription  omeprazole.  As  esomeprazole  is  an  isomer  of  omeprazole,  the 
data  provide  reassurance  that  the  adverse  event  profile  for  esomeprazole  is  unlikely  to  change 
significantly if the product were to be available without prescription. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  esomeprazole  for  the  treatment  of  GERD  is  well  characterised  and  does  not 
reveal new safety signals for self-therapy. Based on the available information the product information 
it  is  considered  appropriate  to  provide  guidance  for  the  safe  use  of  the  medicine  in  the  non-
prescription setting. 
2.6.  Legal status  
The  applicant  requested  the  supply  of  the  medicinal  product  to  be  classified  as  non-prescription 
medicine meaning that the criteria of Article 71 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, do not longer 
apply  to  esomeprazole  for  short-term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms.  For  the  assessment  of  this 
Assessment report  
EMA/498929/2013 
Page 58/70 
 
  
  
request the criteria as laid down in the Commission Guideline on Changing the Classification for the 
Supply of a Medicinal Product for Human Use (European Commission, 2006 revision) apply.  
First  criterion:  Directly  or  indirect  danger,  even  when  used  correctly,  if  utilised  without 
medical supervision 
Direct danger 
Side effect profile: Most of the effects that can occur during short-term use of esomeprazole 20 mg 
tablets are mild, self-limiting and not dependent on dosage. The most frequent of these side effects 
occur  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  (such  as  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  constipation,  flatulence, 
nausea  and  vomiting)  or  manifest  themselves  as  unspecific  symptoms  such  as  headache.  General 
toxicity  of  esomeprazole  when  used  correctly  can  be  considered  low,  and  there  is  no  nonclinical  or 
clinical evidence of organ damage caused by this drug substance.  
Due to the unique mechanism and specific effect on acid secretion the risk of severe side effects of 
Type A or Type B21 is low and very low respectively. The proposed dose of 20 mg per day does not 
need to be adjusted in patients with impaired kidney or liver function. 
Carcinogenicity, embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity: clinical experience with long-term therapy has not 
given any evidence for a carcinogenic potential. Neither nonclinical studies nor clinical epidemiological 
studies  have  shown  any  relevant  reproductive  toxic  or  genotoxic  effects,  and  both  nonclinical  and 
clinical data show that the risks associated with taking esomeprazole during pregnancy are very low. 
Esomeprazole with non-prescription status is not intended for use during pregnancy or lactation due 
to limited clinical data on exposed pregnancies as reflected in the Product Information.  
Interactions  of  esomeprazole  with  commonly  used  medicines  are  rare.  All  known  interactions  are 
listed  in  the  Package  Leaflet,  and  patients  who  are  taking  certain  medications  will  be  advised  to 
consult  a  pharmacist  or  doctor  before  taking  esomeprazole.  Esomeprazole  may  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of other drugs via e.g., its acid-inhibitory effect or metabolic pathways, and dose-
adjustments  might  be  needed.  In  addition,  other  drugs  might  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
esomeprazole. Appropriate advice is given in PIL and SmPC and the risk of interactions is reflected in 
the RMP.  
The  safety  profile  of  esomeprazole  is  comparable  to  the  one  of  other  PPI  treatments  already 
approved for use in the OTC setting. 
Indirect danger 
As  recommended  in  clinical  guidelines  (Flook  et  al  200822,  Tytgat  et  al  200823,  Holtmann  et  al 
201124)  diagnostic  measures  are  often  not  initiated  before  a  short  term  course  of  treatment  with  a 
PPI has been completed in patients with typical reflux symptoms (heartburn / regurgitation) and no 
alarm symptoms, even when under medical supervision.  
Diseases  that  in  similarity  to  GERD  may  include  symptoms  of  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  are 
Peptic ulcers, Barrett’s esophagus and Malignant esophageal or gastric disorders. Patients with peptic 
ulcers most often have epigastric pain as the dominant symptom and heartburn only as a secondary 
symptom.  Patients  with  Barrett’s  esophagus  could  have  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  but 
21 Type A: those that result from exaggeration of a medicinal product’s expected pharmacological actions when given in 
the usual therapeutic dose; normally dose dependent. Type B those that represent a novel response not expected from 
known pharmacological action.

symptoms  recur  after  ending  a  short  term  treatment,  and  the  progression  from  normal  to  Barrett’s 
mucosa and further to dysplasia is a slow process, with a progression rate of at most 1% and 0.5% 
per year, respectively. The occurrence of malignant disorders in the esophagus and stomach without 
other so-called “alarm” symptoms, such as unintentional weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, 
bloody  stool  or  vomit,  fever,  jaundice  or  anaemia  is  rare.  In  addition,  symptomatic  GERD  does  not 
progress in the long-term and the risk of developing pathogenic mucosal changes is low. 
The  Package  Leaflet  includes  clear  instructions  for  the  patient  not  to  start  self-medication  if  certain 
specified alarm symptoms, are present or occur during treatment. Furthermore, the duration of has 
been limited to 2 weeks and patient are advised to consult a doctor if no symptom relief is obtained 
within 2 weeks of continuous treatment; this information is included in the Package Leaflet. 
Self-assessment  
International guidance  for  self-assessment:  according  to  an  international  consensus  conference,  the 
initial medical treatment of GERD is based on the detection and description of the symptoms by the 
patient  (Vakil  et  al  200625).  Heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation,  the  typical  well  defined  and 
documented  symptoms  of  GERD,  can  easily  be  assessed  by  the  patients  themselves.  Signs  and 
symptoms that should initiate a physician-driven investigation, such as alarm symptoms and lack of 
treatment effect, are also easily recognizable by patients. 
Experience  with  self-therapy:  epidemiological  studies  on  the  treatment  of  symptoms  during  self-
medication confirm the ability of patients to independently detect and treat these symptoms. A self-
medication study has shown that the majority of patients used self-medication for the symptoms of 
heartburn  as  intended,  according  to  the  indication  and  dosage  instructions,  and  if  not  free  from 
symptoms  after  14  days  followed  the  recommendations  of  the  patient  information  leaflet  and 
consulted a doctor (Fendrick et al 200426). 
Risk and consequences of incorrect use 
The three main risks’ areas on incorrect use for esomeprazole OTC (i) overdose, (ii) pregnancy and 
lactation,  (iii)  use  in  children  are  discussed  below  together  with  considerations  to  risk  management 
through product information to patients.  
Overdose:  Results  from  non-clinical  studies  indicate  that  esomeprazole  has  a  low  acute  toxicity  by 
the  oral  route.  Clinical  experience  of  doses  in  excess  of  240  mg/day  is  limited.  The  symptoms 
described  in  connection  with  oral  ingestion  of  280  mg  have  been  gastrointestinal  symptoms  and 
weakness. The ingestion of a single dose of 800 mg in an attempt to commit suicide by a patient with 
a medical history of psychiatric disease has been reported. No symptoms were reported. The patient 
was  hospitalised,  clinical  monitoring  and  lavage  of  the  stomach  were  performed  and  the  patient 
recovered.  
The  pack  sizes  are  7  x  20 mg  tablets  and  14  x  20 mg  tablets,  i.e., the  maximum  pack  size  will 
contain  a  total  of  280 mg  esomeprazole.  Thus,  even  if  all  the  tablets  in  an  entire  pack  were  to  be 
ingested  in  a  single  dose,  this  would  only  just  exceed  the  maximum  daily  recommended  dose 
(240 mg in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients) and would not raise any major safety concerns.

Although  clinical  data  on  exposure  to  esomeprazole  during  pregnancy  are  limited,  esomeprazole 
taken during the fertile period or during early pregnancy has not been associated with any significant 
teratogenic risk. The Package Leaflet explicitly states that esomeprazole with non-prescription status 
is  not  intended  for  use  during  pregnancy  and  lactation.  Thus,  accidental  ingestion  of  esomeprazole 
during conception or early pregnancy represents an acceptably low risk. 
Children: 
In  Europe,  esomeprazole  is  approved  for  treatment  of  GERD  in  children  aged  from  1  year  to 
adolescence. In addition, esomeprazole has been approved in the US for children aged from 1 month. 
The adverse event pattern has been similar to that in adults, both in clinical trials and in case reports 
from marketed use and no particular safety concerns have been raised for the paediatric population. 
No  findings  in  juvenile  toxicity  studies  have  indicated  any  specific  risk  in  the  paediatric  population. 
The  applied  non-prescription  medicine  is  not  intended  for  use  in  children  <18  years.  The  Package 
Leaflet explicitly states that esomeprazole with non-prescription status is not intended for use in self-
medication of children under 18 years of age.  In view of this clear labelling and also considering the 
available  information  on  paediatric  use,  the  risk  of  causing  harm  due  to  unintentional  intake  by 
children is considered as low. 
Suitability of patient information 
The  package  leaflet  and  the  labelling  are  considered  adequate  to  contribute  effectively  to  the  safe 
and effective use of the medicine including appropriate guarding that the non-prescription medicine is 
not  used  where  it  is  contraindicated  or  unsafe.  The  written  information  clearly  expresses  when  the 
medicinal  product  should  not  be  used.  An  appropriate  user  testing  of  the  package  leaflet  has  been 
performed in accordance with the legislation. 
Second criterion: Known incorrect use 
Esomeprazole  does  not  produce  euphoric,  stimulant,  sedative  or  other  addictive  effects  most 
commonly  associated  with  abuse  or  misuse.  No  potential  for  misuse  for  illegal  purposes  has  been 
identified. 
Third criterion: Activity or side-effects which require further investigation 
The  active  substance  esomeprazole,  in  comparable  indication,  is  approved  throughout  Europe  since 
2000 and is now approved in 117 countries worldwide. The side effect profile of esomeprazole is well 
investigated and well understood. The medicinal product will not be available without prescription in a 
new  strength,  at  a  new  dose,  using  a  new  route  of  administration,  new  age  group  or  for  a  new 
indication. 
Conclusion: 
The  available  experience  with  esomeprazole  20  mg  orally  is  considered  sufficient  for  assessing  the 
proposed  non-prescription  status,  and  the  documented  use  relevant  for  the  proposed  indication, 
treatment  duration  and  age  group  of  the  medicine.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  supply  as 
non-prescription  medicine  is  appropriate.  It  is  noted  that  specific  aspects  of  the  national 
implementation of a non-prescription status vary amongst Member States.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  efficacy  of  esomeprazole  for  treatment  of  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  as  prescription  only 
medicine  is  well  established.  The  pivotal  studies,  designed  to  show  short  term  efficacy  on  reflux 
symptoms, were performed in patients negative for erosive oesophagitis at endoscopy. In this studies 
Esomeprazole  20 mg  was  significantly  more  effective  compared  to  placebo  in  patient  daily  diary 
symptom scoring regarding the number of patients to reach complete resolution of heartburn, relief 
of  heartburn,  days  without  heartburn  and  mean  heartburn  severity  scoring.  Also  the  number  of 
patients  with  investigator-recorded  resolution  of  heartburn  and/or  regurgitation  was  significantly 
better after esomeprazole 20 mg than after placebo.  
Data  from  meta-analyses  and  studies  presented  by  the  applicant  from  several  investigated  and 
uninvestigated  GERD  populations  could  show  comparable  results  in  terms  of  showing  an  effect  of 
esomeprazole on symptom relief in patients with heartburn and/or acid regurgitation and bridging to 
the uninvestigated patient population who will seek OTC PPI medication is accepted. 
Since most patients obtained complete relief of their reflux symptoms already within 2 weeks of use 
and  only  numerical  improvement  in  partial  responders  achieving  complete  resolution  of  symptoms 
following  an  additional  2  weeks  of  treatment  could  be  shown,  a  maximum  treatment  duration  of  2 
weeks is considered appropriate for the non-prescription setting.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Esomeprazole  as  an  oral  formulation  was  first  approved  for  marketing  in  Sweden  in  2000,  and  is 
currently  approved  in  more  than  125  countries  for  various  acid  related  disorders.  The  efficacy  of 
esomeprazole for treatment of heartburn and acid regurgitation is well established. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  esomeprazole  are  well  established  and  supported  by  post-marketing 
experience.  The majority of adverse reactions identified or suspected in the clinical trials programme 
for  esomeprazole  and  post-marketing  of  ADRs  are  mild  and  transient  in  nature,  the  most  frequent 
being  headache  and  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
i.e.  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea, 
flatulence, 
nausea/vomiting and constipation. No dose-related adverse reactions have been identified. 
The  SmPC  and  Package  Leaflet  provide  appropriate  information  and  guidance  regarding  the 
management  of  the  safety  profile.  This  includes  information  on  interactions  for  which  patients  who 
are  taking  certain  medications  will  be  advised  to  consult  a  pharmacist  or  doctor  before  taking 
esomeprazole. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Although  clinical  data  on  exposure  to  esomeprazole  during  pregnancy  are  limited,  esomeprazole 
taken during the fertile period or during early pregnancy has not been associated with any significant 
teratogenic risk. The Package Leaflet explicitly states that esomeprazole with non-prescription status 
is not intended for use during pregnancy and lactation. 
The  kidney  is  responsible  for  the  excretion  of  the  metabolites  of  esomeprazole  but  not  for  the 
elimination  of  the  parent  compound  therefore  no  dose  adjustment  is  required  in  patients  with 
impaired  renal  function.  However,  due  to  limited  experience  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
insufficiency,  such  patients  should  be  treated  with  caution  as  reflected  in  the  SmPC  and  outlined  in 
the RMP. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The clinical study data submitted demonstrate that esomeprazole 20 mg qd is effective in the short-
term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  (e.g.  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation)  in  adults.  The  rate  of 
improvement from the pivotal trials was highest during the first two weeks of treatment. 
There  is  a  long-standing  safety  experience  with  prescription  esomeprazole  and  its  safety  profile  is 
well characterized and similar to omeprazole which is authorized for 2 weeks OTC use in various EU 
countries. 
Information about the duration of the treatment and limitations that require the patient to minimise 
the risk for an indirect danger and incorrect use are included in the product information.

Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the available clinical efficacy and safety data, and taking into consideration the criteria as 
laid  down  in  the  Commission  Guideline  on  Changing  the  Classification  for  the  Supply  of  a  Medicinal 
Product  for  Human  Use  the  benefit-risk  balance  for the  OTC  use  of  esomeprazole  in  the  short  term 
treatment of reflux symptoms in adults is considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
GERD is a frequent disease with heartburn and acid regurgitation as typical reflux symptoms, which 
for  many  patients  can  severely  affect  quality  of  life.  Tytgat  et  al27  estimate  that  the  number  of 
patients  who  either  self-medicate  or  are  untreated  is  around  80%.  Most  patients  initially  self-
medicate  for  GERD  symptoms  and  consult  a  doctor  only  if  the  symptoms  persist.  Furthermore  for 
consumers without a regular physician, accessing a prescriber may be difficult, time-consuming, and 
expensive. The individual may elect to tolerate the symptoms, assuming them to be self-limiting, and 
will  bear  the  potential  consequences  of  resultant  morbidity28.  In  this  respect  self-therapy  facilitates 
the start of the treatment and is in the interest of the community to minimise the burden in starting 
therapy.  
Diagnosis  and  treatment  follow  the  scientific  knowledge  and  international  consensus  guidelines  that 
recommend starting diagnosis and treatment of GERD primarily based on patient reported symptoms 
and initiate early invasive investigations, such as endoscopy, only if alarm features are present (Dent 
et al 199929, NICE guideline 1730, 2004, DeVault et al 200531, Wang and Hunt 200832). This is also 
reflected in the recommendations in several OTC guidelines, supporting initial self-medication and the 
contact with a physician only if symptoms persist (Flook et al 200833, Tytgat et al 2008, Holtmann et 
al 201134, Haag et al 200935).  
Non-prescription medicines for self-treatment of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation include antacids, 
histamine-2-receptor  antagonists  (H2-RAs)  and  proton  pump  inhibitors  (PPIs).  Recent  clinical 
guidelines recommend treatment with PPIs as initial therapy for patients with symptoms impacting on 
their quality of life. 
The  efficacy  of  esomeprazole  for  short-term  treatment  of  reflux  symptoms  in  adults  has  been 
demonstrated in a population representative for OTC use. Most patients in the pivotal trials obtained 
complete  relief  of  their  reflux  symptoms  already  within  2  weeks  of  use  and  only  numerical 
improvement  in  partial  responders  achieving  complete  resolution  of  symptoms  following  an 
additional  2  weeks  of  treatment  could  be  shown.  Therefore,  in  the  OTC  setting  the  treatment 
duration can be limited to 2 weeks.

Indirect  danger  by  masking  a  more  serious  underlying  condition  that  needs  medical  attention  with 
symptomatic treatment can derive from the OTC status of a medication. Diseases that in similarity to 
GERD  may  include  symptoms  of  heartburn  and  acid  regurgitation  are  Peptic  ulcers,  Barrett’s 
oesophagus  and  malignant  oesophageal  or  gastric  disorders.  The  Package  Leaflet  includes  clear 
instructions  for  the  patient  not  to  start  or  continue  self-medication  if  certain  specified  alarm 
symptoms are present or occur during treatment and to consult a doctor. Signs and symptoms that 
should initiate a physician-driven investigation, such as alarm symptoms and lack of treatment effect, 
are also easily recognizable by patients. 
Also the risk and consequences of incorrect use need to be considered for the OTC setting. Based on 
post marketing data the risk of organ toxicity is considered low, by either accidentally or deliberately 
exceeding the maximum daily dosage. Symptoms described in connection with oral ingestion of 280 
mg  have  been  gastrointestinal  symptoms  and  weakness.  Therefore  characteristics  of  esomeprazole 
do not imply any particular concern as regards the potential for overdose. Additionally the proposed 
small pack size minimizes the risk for abuse or misuse. 
Overall, the CHMP considers that the supply of esomeprazole 20mg Gastro-resistant tablets as non-
prescription  medicine  is  appropriate.  No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nexium Control in the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. 
heartburn and acid regurgitation) in adults is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of 
the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

 INTRODUCTION 
On May 2009, the MAH submitted 13 completed paediatric studies for Axura, in accordance with Article 
45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Axura and that 
there is no consequential regulatory action. 
Memantine was approved for treatment of “moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD)” in the European 
Union (EU) and in the United States. Memantine acts on the glutamatergic system via modulation of N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical studies 
Memantine is currently marketed as a 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablet, and as a 10 mg/g oral drops 
solution. Memantine is not indicated for use in children. So far, no paediatric formulation is available. 
Tablet was the pharmaceutical formulation mostly used in the the clinical studies submitted in this 
application. A memantine HCl peppermint-flavored solution (2 mg/mL) and an intravenous formulation 
were also administered. 
Assessor’s comment 
There are two marketed pharmaceutical forms, film-coated tablets and oral drops, solution. No paediatric 
formulation is available. Marketed formulations may be suitable for children provided that dosage 
recommendations for children were generated, size (tablets) or volume (solution) could be easily 
administered to the target population and an appropriate measuring device could be available in the case 
of the oral drops solution. The MAH should comment on this as well as the eventual development of an 
oral formulation especially suitable for children.

Clinical studies 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Study MEM-MD-24) 
  Description 
Safety and Efficacy of Memantine in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder  
  Methods 
•  Objectives 
The current study was designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the tolerability, safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of memantine in paediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with the diagnosis 
of ADHD combined type. 
•  Study design 
Single-center (USA), open-label, dose-finding outpatient study.

•  Study population /Sample size 
Physically healthy paediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with the following: 
-  A diagnosis of ADHD (combined type) according to the DSM-IV-TR and a semi-structured 
interview (the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age 
Children–Present and Lifetime Versions [K-SADS-PL]) at Screening 
-  An unsatisfactory clinical response to current ADHD therapy (if currently taking ADHD 
medication; washout of all psychoactive medications, prior to the completion of the screening 
period 
-  A total score of 24 or greater on the ADHD-IV-RS; a score of ≥ 4 on the Disorder CGI-ADHD-
- 
Severity, at Baseline 
Intelligence in the non-mentally retarded range, as measured by a standardized score of ≥ 70 on 
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition (PPVT-III), at Screening 
The sample size for this open-label pilot study was not based on statistical considerations, but was deemed 
adequate to address the objectives of this study. 
•  Treatments 
Memantine HCl (2 mg/mL) peppermint flavoured oral solution was supplied. Patients were treated in two 
different dose cohorts: Cohort 1 (titrated to a maximum daily memantine dose of 10 mg) and Cohort 2 
(titrated to a maximum daily memantine dose of 20 mg) for a period of up to 8 weeks-4 weeks of titration 
and 4 weeks of maintenance therapy.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Measures: Adverse event (AE) recording, clinical laboratory measures, vital sign parameters, 
physical examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
Efficacy Measures: 
o  ADHD-IV-RS, Parent Version 
o  CGI-ADHD-S 
o  Conner’s Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition (CCPT II) 
o  Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ III) Math Fluency Test 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured. PK analyses were performed and are described in a separate 
study report not submitted. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Safety: Safety analyses were based on the Safety Population (all patients who were enrolled and who took 
at least one dose of study medication).  
Efficacy: The efficacy analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, based on the ITT Population, 
defined as all patients in the Safety Population who had at least one post-Baseline assessment of ADHD-
IV-RS or CGI-ADHD-S. Descriptive statistics were presented by cohort and overall using the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) and the observed cases (OC) approaches. No inferential statistics 
were performed.

  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 16 patients, 8 in each cohort, were enrolled and included in the Safety and ITT populations. 
Eight (8) of 8 patients in Cohort 1 prematurely discontinued from the study, 7 patients (87.5%) for 
insufficient therapeutic response and 1 patient for withdrawal of consent. As a result, the protocol was 
amended to allow the subsequent 8 patients (Cohort 2) to titrate to a maximum memantine dose of 20 
mg/d. Seven (7) of 8 (87.5%) patients in Cohort 2 reached a final daily dose of 20 mg/d. Of the 8 patients 
in Cohort 2, 3 patients (37.5%) discontinued because of insufficient therapeutic response; 1 patient 
(12.5%) was lost to follow-up. 
•  Efficacy results 
Patient scores on both the ADHD-IV-RS and the CGI-ADHD-S improved relative to Baseline, the largest 
improvement being observed in the 20-mg/d cohort. No improvement was observed using the cognitive 
measures CCPT-II, WJ III Math and Reading Fluency tests, and the Stroop Test.

•  Safety results 
There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or AEs that resulted in treatment discontinuation 
during this study. TEAEs were reported in 4 of 8 (50%) patients in Cohort 1 and 6 of 8 (75%) patients in 
Cohort 2. TEAEs that occurred in at least three patients and were more common in patients in Cohort 2 
compared to Cohort 1 were dizziness, headache, and pyrexia. Most TEAEs occurred during the 4-week 
titration phase of the study. Most TEAEs were considered mild in severity and not related to study drug. 
During the study no clinically relevant changes were detected in vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs, or 
physical examinations.  
Assessor’s comment 
The use of memantine in ADHD patients was based on preliminary data suggesting that glutamate and 
NMDA receptor activity may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Other uncompetitive NMDA 
receptor antagonist, amantadine has demonstrated activity in children with several different behavioural 
disturbances. 
The interpretation of the results of this pilot study is limited given the open-label design and its small 
sample size. In principle no dose finding strategy in children appears to be developed. Daily  doses of 10 
mg/d (half that the dose-approved adult dosage) were initially chosen. This dose showed to be 
inefficacious in the moderate ADHD population involved in the trial. The results in patients treated with 
20 mg/d dosage do not seem neither uncourageous as almost 40% discontinued the study due to lack of 
efficacy. No safety concerns were identified.  
Pharmacokinetic results have not been provided.  
2.2 Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) 
A total of 4 investigator-initiated clinical trials were published that reported the use of memantine in 
children, adolescents and young adults with PDD.

Assessor’s comment 
Methodological limitations such as uncontrolled design, retrospective analysis, small sample size, or 
concomitant treatment with other medication make difficult to draw sound conclusions on the use of 
memantine in autistic spectrum conditions. Regarding the safety data, up to 40% of the patients enrolled 
in the clinical studies reported AEs (mainly related to behavioural events).  
Apparently initial pharmacokinetic in children will be provided by one study conducted in patients with 
autistic spectrum disorder (MEM-PK-21). No information has been submitted by the MAH on this issue.  
Motorfunction abnormalities (spasticity) 
  Description 
In the 1980ies, a total of 8 clinical studies of phase II  have been performed by the MAH. Target 
indications for the use of memantine were motor function abnormalities, mainly spasticity. For all these 
trials, only summary information in the form of summary reports and statements is available.

With one exception all trials were using open and uncontrolled designs. Memantine was often used as add-
on therapy to other surgical and/or pharmacological treatment modalities.  
Overall the number of patients enrolled in these trials was limited. With one exception (Z038) none of the 
studies assessed an exclusive paediatric population. The patients enrolled in these trials had a broad age 
range (from 1 month to 75 years) and in the majority of studies a few paediatric patients only were 
investigated together with a predominant adult population. Patient groups in these trials were very 
heterogeneous with regard to underlying pathology, as well as disease duration at the time of treatment 
initiation. The results cannot selectively be assessed for a paediatric subpopulation.

  Results 
•  Efficacy results 
Significant post-treatment improvements in spasticity and/or reductions in muscle spasm were reported by 
investigators in all studies. The percentage of “treatment responders” differed among studies; at least in 
part this may have been due to the heterogeneous patient groups enrolled (various underlying pathologies 
and/or treatment start at various intervals after the initial event). Best results were reported in patients with 
moderate degree of spasticity of limited duration, as in these cases, secondary anatomical changes (i.e. 
occurrence of progressive joint contractures and limb deformities due to shortening of joint capsules, 
ligaments and tendons) are less severe.  
•  Safety results 
Only very limited information regarding the safety and tolerability of memantine in a paediatric 
population can be derived from these trials.

Assessor’s comment 
The MAH has provided short reports of 8 clinical studies conducted under non-GCP conditions. Most of 
them show relevant methodological limitations (uncontrolled design, small sample size, few paediatric 
patients in some of the studies, short duration of treatment). Both efficacy and safety results appear of 
insufficient quality to draw any conclusion about the use of memantine in the treatment of spasticity in 
paediatric population. 
Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The MAH has submitted information about the available results from the clinical investigation in 
paediatric population. This investigation involves three areas: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity, motor 
function abnormalities and autistic spectrum disorder. These indications are not approved in adults or 
elderly patients. Efficacy and safety results coming from the submitted studies conducted in the paediatric 
population are inconclusive. The benefit/risk of the product does not require to be updated in this respect.  
Some information about pharmacokinetic characterisation in children and adolescent subjects seem to be 
generated by different pharmacokinetic studies (or analyses). These data have not been submitted in this 
variation. Once these data are received, it should be assessed whether the information provided is 
sufficiently robust to update the SPC accordingly. Therefore, the MAH is asked to provide and discuss it.   
  Recommendation  
x  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide clarification about the development of a paediatric 
formulation and pharmacokinetic characterisation in children and adolescents as part of this procedure

Based on the data submitted, the MAH is requested to submit their responses to the two questions below 
within 1 month. The responses will be assessed as follow-up measure P45.1. 
1.    The MAH should comment on the suitability of the marketed formulations for children as well as the 
eventual development of an oral formulation especially suitable for this population. 
2.    Some information about pharmacokinetic characterisation in children and adolescent subjects seem 
to have be generated in different PK studies (or analyses). These data have not been submitted in 
this procedure. The MAH is therefore asked to provide the data and to further discuss them.

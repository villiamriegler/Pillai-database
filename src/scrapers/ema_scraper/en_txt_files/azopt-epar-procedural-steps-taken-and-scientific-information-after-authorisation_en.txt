Editorial changes in the text in the SmPC section “5.3 Pre-
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
clinical Safety Data”. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to remove the term "Drop-tainer" from Section 
6.5 of the SmPC. The package leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Results from the study show that in children not previously 
treated, the efficacy of Azopt is similar to the one in adults. 
However, in children who received prior treatment with 
Intra Ocular Pressure (IOP) lowering medication, the mean 
IOP changes from baseline did not decrease, and in fact a 
slight increase was observed in Azopt group.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for naltrexone / bupropion, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), including four cases with 
a  close  temporal  relationship  and  supported  by  data  for  the  mono-substance  bupropion,  the  PRAC 
considers  that  a  causal  relationship  between  naltrexone/bupropion  and  AGEP  is  at  least  a  reasonable 
possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing naltrexone/bupropion should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for naltrexone / bupropion the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing naltrexone / bupropion is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

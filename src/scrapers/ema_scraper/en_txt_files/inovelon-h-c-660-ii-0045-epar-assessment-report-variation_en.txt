1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eisai Ltd submitted to the European 
Medicines Agency on 30 August 2017 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of indication to include the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome in 
patients 1 year of age and older as adjunctive therapy; as a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and the RMP (version 10.0) are updated accordingly. 
In addition the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make small corrections with 
the Product Information and to update the name and contact details of the local representative in Belgium 
and Luxembourg. Furthermore, the Product Information is brought in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and Risk Management Plan. 
Information relating to orphan designation 
Inovelon was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/240 on 20 October 2004. Inovelon was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome. 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decisions 
P/0116/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0116/2016 was completed. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 4/103 
 
  
  
 
 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Protocol assistance and regulatory interactions 
The applicant did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP. 
The MAH met the CHMP Co-rapporteur Team (MPA) within the framework of a Pre-submission Meeting on 
12-May-17.  
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss all outstanding issued listed as major objections in the CHMP 
Rapporteur’s final assessment report for the Type II variation application procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037. This application was submitted in February 2016 to facilitate modification of 
the then (and presently) approved indication to extend the use of rufinamide from patients 4 years and 
above to 1 year and above. 
From the discussions/minutes, it seems that the MPA supported the approach of using a sparse sampling 
design and agreed that it is not possible to fully elucidate rufinamide absorption.  
It was acknowledged by MPA that exposures have been sufficiently demonstrated to be similar in the 
different age groups. 
However, concerning the visual predictive checks (VPC), MPA was of the opinion that the PK analysis 
contained vague model prediction intervals and added they would like to see more elaborate VPCs with 
prediction intervals for the central tendency and outer percentiles. A minimum of 100 replicates of 
simulation were requested. Eisai pointed out that the prediction-corrected VPCs as presented in PPK 
Report CPMS-E2080-003R-v1, without prediction intervals for the central tendency and outer percentiles, 
alongside the goodness-of-fit plots and model validation results are adequate to support the qualification 
and validity on the final developed PPK model. 
Pertaining to this request, Eisai pointed out that there appears to be some divergent opinions or 
misalignment in regard to requirements concerning data analysis/interpretation within the Agency (EMA). 
This is owing to the fact that the current prediction-corrected VPCs in the PPK report were performed in 
accordance with the request of the assessor from the rapporteur’s team to perform VPCs as described in 
the publication: (Bergstrand M, Hooker AC, Wallin JE, Karlsson MO. Prediction-corrected visual predictive 
checks for diagnosing nonlinear mixed-effects models AAPS J. 2011; 13(2):143-51). This means any 
amendments made to satisfy MPA may not satisfy the assessors from ANSM. MPA advised they would 
raise this point at their upcoming working party meeting so steps can be taken to avoid this in the future. 
Further, MPA requested Eisai provide an explanation as to why rufinamide exposure and relative viability 
was higher in the first model provided in CPMS-E2080-002R-v2 compared to that in the second model in 
CPMS-E2080-003R-v1. They also noted that exposure seemed to vary with body weight. 
Finally, MPA advised Eisai to revisit the elementary scaling components which appear to be lower than 
0.75 and in the steady state model about 0.83.

2.  Scientific discussion 
Rufinamide film-coated tablets were first approved in the EU via the Centralised Procedure in the 
European Commission (EC) decision dated 16 January 2007 for use as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years of age and older. 
The purpose of this Type II variation is to expand the existing product label to include treatment of 
seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in paediatric patients 1 year of age and older. The 
current extension of Indication was initially requested in application EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037 submitted 
to the European Medicine’s Agency (EMA) on 10 Feb 2016.  
This new application is based on: 
•  Study CRUF331-0022: Study 022, a single, pivotal, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized, parallel-group study) comparing the safety and efficacy of rufinamide as adjunctive 
therapy relative to placebo in subjects 4 to 35 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS. 
•  Study E2080-G000-303: Study 303, A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open-label Study to 
Evaluate the Cognitive Development Effects and Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Adjunctive 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 6/103 
 
  
  
 
Rufinamide Treatment in Pediatric Subjects 1 to less than 4 Years of Age with Inadequately Controlled 
LGS. 
•  A revised population PK analysis and Module 2.7.2 (CPMS-E2080-003R-v2 / Population 
Pharmacokinetics of Rufinamide in Subjects With Epilepsy Including Inadequately Controlled Lennox-
Gastaut Syndrome (Studies E2080-G000-303, CRUF331 0022 and E2080-J081-304)) to address 
concerns highlighted in the Agency’s final assessment report of initial application 
EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037 relating to the indication extension.  
Overall, at the time of the initial Application, the CHMP considered that a positive benefit-risk balance of 
rufinamide in the add-on treatment of seizures in LGS patients aged 1 to <4 years could not be 
concluded. This was mainly due to the outstanding concerns with the population PK simulations and the 
largely inconclusive results of study 303 with regards to efficacy. Indeed, the available PK data and 
simulations were not considered suitable to support dosing recommendations in the new proposed age 
group of 1 to less than 4 year old LGS patients. The data used for the coarse population PK model from 
patient with inadequately controlled LGS were too limited to allow a reliable testing for differences in 
absorption, distribution and elimination by age. Furthermore, the choice of model parameters and 
prediction power of a new PK model including an enlarged data set from patients with LGS, other forms of 
epilepsy and from healthy subjects had not been sufficiently justified at the time of this report, thus not 
allowing to draw firm conclusion from the resulting PK predictions. The CHMP furthermore recommended 
that the MAH should re-develop a qualified/validated population PK model. 
In light of this CHMP view, the MAH decided to no longer pursue an extension of the indication and the 
outstanding issues with the model were not further addressed. Moreover, the decision to no longer 
pursue the extension of indication was also made as the applicant aimed to obtain an extension to the 
marketing exclusivity of rufinamide, which could not have been reached within the Application timeframe, 
as it was apparent a resolution could not be reached. 
Thus, the scope of the current application is to fulfil the CHMP recommendation by submitting a revised 
population PK analysis (CPMS-E2080-003R-v2) to address concerns highlighted in the Agency’s final 
assessment report of initial application EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037. The current Type II variation includes 
among other things a graphical presentation of observed data from Study 303 superimposed with data 
from Studies 022 and 304 to demonstrate comparability in steady state exposure to rufinamide in LGS 
subjects from 1 to less than 4 years old to that in LGS subjects 4 years old and above. 
For the Efficacy and Safety parts of rufinamide for the proposed paediatric population, the applicant 
considers that these parts has been extensively discussed during the initial application 
EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037 and that conclusions should be drawn from it to support the efficacy and 
safety parts. Given that no additional efficacy/safety data have been submitted in the scope of the 
current application, the applicant proposal seems to be acceptable. Thus, CHMP discussion and conclusion 
from the initial application, especially those related to the efficacy and safety part, are included in the 
corresponding sections of this report. 
Of note, from a regulatory point of view, the initial application to update the product information with 
relevant paediatric data was maintained, as this was considered as acceptable by the CHMP. Indeed, the 
benefit-risk balance of Inovelon in the approved indication in patients 4 years of age and older with LGS 
remained positive. The CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation 
concerning the change/update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order to include 
additional information relevant to the paediatric population based on the results of study 303 in patients 
aged 1 to less than 4 years with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and the results from toxicity studies in 
juvenile animals. Section 5.1 was furthermore updated to add additional information on the design of 
study 022 in LGS patients aged 4 years and older.

2.1.  Introduction 
Rufinamide is a triazole derivative that exhibits broad-spectrum anticonvulsant properties by elevating 
seizure threshold and preventing seizure spread. In vitro pharmacodynamic data indicate that rufinamide 
interacts with the inactivated state of sodium channels and slows conversion to the active state thereby 
reducing the frequency of sodium dependent action potentials. 
Rufinamide is the active substance of Inovelon, which was approved in the European Union/European 
Economic Area through the Centralised Procedure by Commission Decision in 2007 for use as adjunctive 
therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 4 years 
of age and older. The product was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS in the 
European Union in 2004. 
Inovelon is available as tablets (100, 200, and 400 mg formulations) as well as an oral suspension (40 
mg/ml). The oral suspension was developed in accordance with a post-approval commitment to the initial 
marketing authorisation as a child-friendly formulation, which is more convenient for administration to 
young children and those unable to swallow tablets. In patients weighing 30 kg or more, treatment with 
Inovelon should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, the 
dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments. The maximum dose depends on weight. In patients < 
30 kg, treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg, which may be further increased by 200 
mg/day increments, as frequently as every two days, up to a maximum recommended dose of 1000 
mg/day. Lower doses are recommended in the patients if they receive concomitant valproate. Inovelon 
should be taken together with food twice daily, in two equally divided doses. 
LGS is rare and is one of the most severe forms of childhood epilepsy. The syndrome usually has its onset 
between the ages of 1 and 8 years (typically between 3 and 5 years), but occasionally it occurs in 
children who are more than 8 years old. LGS continues to manifest into adulthood in a large number of 
patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The hallmarks of the disease include 
the following triad: 
• 
• 
• 
The presence of multiple seizure types: the most characteristic are tonic-atonic seizures and 
atypical absences, but tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and partial seizures are also frequently present. 
Tonic-atonic seizures often provoke sudden falls (commonly called drop attacks) and result in 
injuries. 
The presence of generalized discharges with slow spike-and-wave complexes in the 
electroencephalogram (EEG). 
The presence of mental retardation or a learning disability. In general, this is represented by a 
static encephalopathy, although the mental status may worsen in the course of the disease due to 
multiple causes, such as very frequent occurrence of seizures, sometimes subclinical, frequent 
head trauma from the falls associated with seizures (drop attacks), and undesirable cognitive 
effects of the high doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used to treat this very refractory type of 
epilepsy. 
The aetiology of LGS remains unknown in about half of the cases, whereas in others, the syndrome 
results from obvious brain injury. The most common identifiable factor is a history of infantile spasms, 
occurring in up to one-third of the cases. Other causes include perinatal central nervous system (CNS) 
trauma, meningitis and encephalitis, tumour, and severe head trauma. However, the electro-clinical 
features are identical. The expression of LGS is similar in the younger population compared to older 
children and adults. However, at 1 year of age, the diagnosis of LGS can be very challenging in particular 
in children with a history of infantile spasms or West Syndrome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 8/103 
 
  
  
As children with LGS grow older they may continue to have atypical absence seizures, generalized tonic-
clonic seizures and atonic seizures through adolescence and into adulthood (van Rijckevorsel 2008). Most 
longitudinal studies consistently show that approximately 50% of LGS patients will retain the 
characteristic features of LGS if followed for 5-10 years into adulthood (Oguni 1996, Oller-Daurella 1973, 
and Beaumanoir 1982, referenced in Glauser and Morita, 2006). 
With the present application, the MAH sought to extend the indication to include paediatric patients from 
1 year to less than 4 years of age. The application was supported by data from an open label safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study (study E2080-G000-303, hereafter referred to as study 303) in children aged 
1 to less than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS and a juvenile toxicity study in beagle 
dogs. 
Both studies were part of the PIP. In addition, population pharmacokinetic (pop PK) simulations were 
conducted. 
No additional study to establish efficacy of rufinamide in the new age group of 1-4 year olds was 
conducted. Instead, reference was made to the original pivotal study (Study CRUF331 0022), in which 
efficacy of rufinamide in the add-on treatment of LGS had been demonstrated in an older paediatric 
population. The MAH claimed that efficacy can be extrapolated to the younger patients because as the 
disorder is physiologically similar in both age ranges. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support the application for an extension of the target population for Inovelon to patients aged 1-4 
years, the MAH provided previously the results of a 14-week juvenile toxicity study in dogs aged 6 weeks 
at initiation of treatment, which is equivalent to a 2-year old human. These studies were evaluated during 
the previous variation EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037. 
A total of 3 pivotal toxicity studies were performed in juvenile animals, one in rats and two in dogs. 
Juvenile rats were 7 days of age at treatment initiation, which is equivalent to a human neonate based on 
an interspecies comparison of CNS and reproductive development. The youngest juvenile dogs were 6 
weeks at treatment initiation, which is equivalent to a 2-year old human based on the same parameters. 
Therefore, it patients aged 1-4 years are covered by these studies. The latter did not identify an 
increased sensitivity of juvenile animals to the toxicity of rufinamide, and showed that the target organs 
were the same as in adults (liver in both species, and kidneys in rats). Overall, it is considered that the 
available nonclinical package supports the extension of indication to patients aged 1-4 years. 
Concerning the Environmental risk Assessment, no new study has been included in this submission. The 
applicant proposed a new refined Fpen and consequently a new phase II ERA and he answered to CHMP 
request about the timeline on study concerning the sediment dwelling organism and classification of 
rufinamide as very persistent compound.

Phase 1: Estimation of exposure 
Refined Fpen 
The applicant submitted an estimation for the years 2017 to 2021 of the predicted amount of the drug 
substance (rufinamide) consumed in the EU-G5 and in the EU as a whole, as a result of the use of 
Inovelon Tablets and Inovelon Oral Suspension, both of which are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 1 year and older. 
The maximum total consumption of rufinamide in a single year in the EU-G5 (2017-2021) from the use of 
Inovelon Tablets and Inovelon Oral Suspension has been projected to be 3,093,013,066 mg + 
14,741,256 mg = 3,107,754,322 mg for the year 2018. 
Therefore, the refined market penetration Fpen (%) is calculated as: 
Refined Fpen % = (Consumption x 100)/(DOSEai x EU-G5 inhabitants x 365) 
Refined Fpen % = 3,107,754,322 mg x 100 / 3200 mg x 323,990,731 x 365 
Refined Fpen % = 0.0008 
PEC surface water calculation 
According to the guideline, the PEC surfacewater is calculated as follows: 
PECsurfacewater (mg/L) = (DOSEai x Refined Fpen)/(WASTEWinhab x DILUTION) 
PECsurfacewater (mg/L) = (3200 x 0.000008)/(200 x 10) 
PEC surface water (µg/L)=0.0128 µg/L

Table 2 Values Supporting the Calculation of Refined Fpen for Rufinamide from the Use of Inovelon 
Tablets and Inovelon Oral Suspension Combined 
As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the maximum total consumption of rufinamide in a single year in the 
EU-G5 (2017-2021) from the use of Inovelon Tablets and Inovelon Oral Suspension has been projected to 
be 3,093,013,066 mg + 14,741,256 mg = 3,107,754,322 mg for the year 2018. EU-G5 member states 
are projected to have the highest per capita use/consumption in the EU, and therefore present a worst-
case scenario for environmental exposure to rufinamide. The number of EU-G5 inhabitants at year 2018 
is based on the EUROSTAT projection of 323,990,731 inhabitants. 
Therefore, the refined market penetration Fpen (%) is calculated as: 
The calculation of the PEC SURFACEWATER for rufinamide is shown below with the values supporting the 
calculation provided in Table 3.

Outcome of Phase II Tier A fate and effect analysis. 
Using the refined Fpen value for the PEC calculations,   
All  the  PEC/PNEC  ratio  are  all  below  the  trigger  value,  therefore,    it  can  be  concluded  that  rufinamide 
and/or its metabolites are extremely unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment, groundwater 
compartiment or for the microorganism.  
The log Kow of rufinamide is significantly <3. Furthermore, rufinamide is not highly adsorptive, does not 
belong to  a  class  of  substances  known  to  have  a  potential to  accumulate in  living  organisms,  and  there 
are  no  indications  from  structural  features  for  bioaccumulative  potential.  Therefore,  a  bioconcentration 
study is not indicated and the risk for bioaccumulation is considered to be negligible. 
Koc :  In a GLP-compliant OECD Guideline 106 study, the adsorption-desorption behavior of rufinamide 
was studied in 2 sludges and 3 soils, the adsorption coefficient values including Koc were below the 
trigger for Phase II Tier B assessment for the terrestrial compartment. 
Ready biodegradability / Water-sediment study 
Rufinamide  was  not  readily  biodegradable  under  the  conditions  of  a  modified  Sturm  test  performed. 
However by Day 29 of this study, there was 7% to 9% biodegradation of rufinamide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 14/103 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In  an  OECD  308  study,  the  aerobic  degradation  of  rufinamide  in  2  water/sediment  systems  was 
investigated. The study showed that rufinamide was rapidly degraded in the water layer and in sediment. 
Very  low  to  non-detectable  levels  were  present  in  both  sediment  types  (less  than  1.3%  by  Day  14  and 
0.0%  by  Days  28,  64  and  99).  The  major  transformation  product  and  bound  residues  were observed in 
both  sediment  types.  The  transformation  product  has  demonstrated  significant  shifting  to  the  sediment 
(14%  after  28  days  and  22%  after  14  days  in  each  of  the  two  systems  investigated)  and  based  on  the 
50%  degradation/dissipation  time  [DT50  >  1  year  at  12°C  (196/473  d  at  20°C)]  was  found  as  very 
persistent in water-sediment-system. 
Further  water/sediment  fate  and  effects  investigations  will  be  undertaken  as  a  post  authorization 
commitment. The transformation product observed in Project 500465 Aerobic Degradation of Rufinamide 
in  Two  Water/Sediment  Systems  will  be  identified  in  a  specifically  designed  water/sediment  study.  This 
transformation  product  has  already  been  quantified  in  the  water  layer  and  in  the  sediment  in  Project 
500465  in  both  water/sediment  systems  over  99  days.  Further  quantification  of  this  transformation 
product  in  OECD  308  water/sediment  systems  is  not  considered  necessary  for  the  environmental  risk 
assessment. 
In  line  with  EMA  Questions  and  answers  on  ‘Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  26  May  2016),  the 
company  plans  to  perform  an  OECD  218  Sediment-Water  Chironomid  Toxicity  Test  Using  Spiked 
Sediment with 14C-radiolabelled rufinamide (parent compound) as the test substance. This is considered 
to  be  optimal  for  risk  assessment  purposes  as  the  chironomid  test  organisms  will  be  exposed  to  both 
rufinamide  and  the  transformation  product  in  the  test  system.  As  shown  in  Project  500465,  the 
transformation  product  is  rapidly  formed  in  both  the  water  layer  and  the  sediment.  In  the  OECD  218 
study, it is planned that the water layer, pore water and sediment layer will be analysed for radioactivity, 
rufinamide and the identified transformation product. 
As a post authorization commitment, the applicant proposed the following timelines for Conducting 
Studies  
•  1Q FY2018: - synthesis of radiolabelled rufinamide 
•  2Q FY2018 to 4Q FY2018: Conduct OECD 218 study along with associated investigations as 
detailed in Company Response 
• 
Provide updated ERA with study report(s) from 4Q FY 2018 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Juvenile toxicity studies in rats and dogs has previously been submitted and assessed in the initial MAA 
(EMEA/H/C/000660) and in a previous Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037).  
Altogether a total of 3 pivotal toxicity studies with rufinamide have been performed in juvenile animals; 
one 10-week study in rats aged 7 days at treatment initiation, one 13-week study in dogs aged 4 months 
at treatment initiation, and finally one 14-week study in dogs aged 6 weeks at initiation of treatment. 
The juvenile toxicity studies showed that the target organs in juvenile and adult animals were the same 
(liver in both species, and kidneys in rats) and that juvenile animals were no more sensitive than adult 
animals to the toxic effects of rufinamide. No effect on behavioural and physical development was 
observed in juvenile rats, and there were no effects on neuro-behavioural, brain measurement or bone 
parameters in juvenile dogs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 15/103 
 
  
  
Based on an interspecies comparison of CNS and reproductive development, the paediatric age range 
from 1 to 4 years have been adequately covered by these studies.  
Relevant information is included in section 5.3 of the SmPC and no further updates are needed. 
Environmental risk assessment: 
The updated ERA including the Phase II Tier A analysis are considered acceptable. All PEC/PNEC ratios 
were significantly below the trigger values. Log Kow and Koc were below the trigger values and no further 
study was required.  
However, a transformation product of rufinamide was shown to significantly shift to the sediment. The 
results also showed that the transformation product of rufinamide was very persistent in water-sediment-
system (DT50 effects on sediment dwelling organisms should be investigated in an OECD 218 Sediment-
Water Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment with 14> 1 year). Therefore, a specifically 
designed water/sediment study should be conducted to identify this transformation product. In addition, 
the effects on sediment dwelling organisms should be investigated in an OECD 218 Sediment-Water 
Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment with 14C-radiolabelled rufinamide (parent compound) as 
the test substance. The Applicant is recommended to perform these studies post approval. 
According to the OECD 308 study, DT50, water = 196 days which is over the threshold of classification 
“very persistent”, therefore the CHMP considers that rufinamide has to be classified as very persistent in 
the environment. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The studies performed with rufinamide in juvenile animals adequately cover the proposed paediatric 
target population of Inovelon.  
The results of the OECD 308 study clearly show that the major transformation product (Region 2, RT 
17,90 min, HPLC, SL water, after 64 d) of rufinamide fulfils the criteria for very persistent in water-
sediment-systems based on a DT50 >1 year at 12 °C (196/ 473 d at 20 °C). Consequently, in the CHMP’s 
view rufinamide has to be classified as very persistent in the environment. The information on the 
classification of rufinamide as very persistent in the environment is reflected in the SmPC section 5.3. 
Furthermore, the following measures are considered necessary to address non-clinical issues: 
Effects on sediment dwelling organisms should be investigated in an OECD 218 Sediment-Water 
Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment with 14a specifically designed water/sediment study 
should be conducted to identify this transformation product. In addition, the C-radiolabelled rufinamide 
(parent compound) as the test substance should be identified. The applicant is expected to submit the 
result of this study during 2018.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic Modelling 
The current Type II variation includes the data from population PK Study 303 completed in subjects with 
LGS from 1 to less than 4 years old, and also makes comparisons with the PK data in subjects with LGS 
and  other  types  of  epilepsy  4  years  old  and  above  who  were  evaluated  in  previous  clinical  studies. 
Additionally,  an  update  of  the  population-PK  modelling  including  paediatric  data  (1-4  years)  and  other 
data collected in older children, adolescent and adults are also provided. For reminder, the basic scatter 
plot of concentrations observed in young and older children are reported and briefly commented as it was 
part of the earlier submission. However, the present report will focus on the new population-PK analysis 
(CPMS-E2080-003R-v2). 
Studies included in the population PK and times for blood sampling for PK analysis are shown below:

Base model structure 
A one compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and linear elimination parameterized for 
clearance (CL/F), volume of distribution (V/F) and absorption rate constant (Ka) was fitted to the data. 
The inter-individual variability (IIV) (η, ETA) was assessed on all three parameters using an exponential 
error structure, assuming normal distribution for these parameters. A covariance between inter-individual 
variability terms for CL/F and V/F was assessed by application of the omega block. Inter-occasion 
variability (IOV) was assessed on CL/F, and V/F and Ka parameters. The residual variability (ε) was 
assessed by additive, proportional and combined additive/proportional error structures. All permutations 
of inter-individual and residual variability error structures were tested systematically. 
First-order condition estimation with interaction (FOCEI) was used. 
Covariate model: 
The effect of the following covariates was investigated on rufinamide PK: formulation (tablet: roller dry 
compaction tablet formulation [RC], wet granulation/predensification tablet formulation [WP], 
suspension), demographics (sex, race, age [both as continuous and categorical], and body weight), renal 
function (creatinine clearance), and liver function (alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin). Concomitant 
administration of other AEDs such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, and valproic acid, were 
evaluated as categorical covariates. Plasma concentrations of valproate were also evaluated as a 
continuous covariate. 
Final PK Model for Rufinamide: 
A one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination from the central compartment adequately 
described rufinamide profiles from the pooled studies. The model was parameterized for absorption rate 
constant (Ka), apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and bioavailability for the 
roller dry compaction tablet (Old tablet) compared to the wet granulation/predensification tablet 
(Marketed) and oral suspension. The final population PK model for rufinamide contained the statistically 
significant effects of: 
•  Body weight on CL/F and on V/F 
•  Gender on V/F 
•  Daily dose per kg and formulation on Ka 
•  Daily dose per kg and roller dry compaction tablet on bioavailability 
•  Concomitant phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate on CL/F

Additionally, the effect of the following covariates was investigated on rufinamide PK: formulation (tablet: 
roller dry compaction tablet formulation [RC], wet granulation/predensification tablet formulation [WP], 
suspension), demographics (gender, race), renal function (creatinine clearance), liver function (alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate amino transferase and total bilirubin) and concomitant carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, lamotrigine, valproic acid and valproate concentrations contained the statistically significant 
effects of: 
•  An increase in both clearance and volume with an increase in body weight (where scaling 
parameters for effect of body weight on CL/F and V/F have been estimated) 
•  A decrease in Ka with an increase in daily dose per kg: Ka decreases from 0.256 1/h to 0.202 1/h 
when increasing the suspension dose from 10 mg/kg/day to 45 mg/kg/day  
• 
Lower bioavailability (0.78) for RC (Old formulation) relative to the WP (Marketed formulation) 
and suspension 
•  A decrease in bioavailability with an increase in daily dose per kg: bioavailability decreases from 
0.85 to 0.57 when increasing the WP or suspension dose from 10 mg/kg/day to 45 mg/kg/day  
• 
Lower absorption rate constant for the WP and suspension formulations compared to the  
•  RC

•  Slightly lower (17%) volume of distribution in female compared to males 
•  26% and 42% higher clearance with concomitant CARB and PHEN, respectively, and 24% lower 
clearance with concomitant valproate 
•  The final PK model was re-run by fixing scaling parameters to 0.75 for CL/F and 1 for V/F and 
there were no consequential difference observed in final model parameters using either estimated 
or fixed scaling parameters on CL/F and V/F. 
• 
In the presence of the above significant effects none of the following covariates was found to be 
statistically significant: 
•  Clearance: age, gender, race, liver biomarkers, creatinine clearance and concomitant lamotrigine 
•  Volume: age and race 
•  This clearly indicates that in the presence of body weight effect on CL/F and V/F the PK of 
rufinamide is independent of sex, race, or age. 
•  The parameter estimates, precision of the estimate and 95% CI for the final PK model are 
presented below (Table 8).

Goodness-of-fit 
Goodness-of-fit-plots for the final PK model were presented. The scatter plots of population predicted and 
individual predicted versus observed concentrations showed reasonably well even distribution around the 
line of unity. Additionally, a scatter plot of conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) versus population 
predicted concentrations showed the CWRES to be roughly evenly distributed around zero, supporting the 
validity of the PK model. 
Visual predictive check (VPC) 
In order to evaluate the predictive performance of the final PK model for rufinamide, prediction corrected 
visual predictive checks (pcVPCs) were performed by study. For each respective study 250 replicates 
were simulated using the final PK model. Using the simulated data corrected for typical model predictions, 
the 90% prediction intervals were determined and plotted together with observed rufinamide 
concentrations.  
Bootstrap Method

A nonparametric bootstrap for the final rufinamide PK model was conducted. The confidence intervals 
were generally narrow and the median values of the distribution of bootstrapped parameter values were 
also consistent with the original parameter estimates from the final PK model. 
Model-Derived Exposure Predictions 
Boxplots of dose-normalized (45 mg/kg) steady-state daily AUC by age category are presented in Figure 
5 for LGS subjects only. In general, dose-normalized (45 mg/kg) steady-state daily AUC was comparable 
across all age groups at approximately 380 μg∙h/mL in all subjects and for LGS-only subjects.

Boxplots of dose-normalized (45 mg/kg) steady-state daily AUC by concomitant medication are presented 
in Figure 6 for LGS subjects only. Overall, in all subjects and in LGS subjects only the exposure to 
rufinamide appear to be lower with concomitant phenytoin or carbamazepine and higher in the presence 
of valproate compared to the that in subjects not receiving any of these concomitant AEDs. As illustrated 
in the boxplots there is substantial overlap in exposure with and without these concomitant AEDs. 
According to the MAH, concomitant administration of rufinamide with the two inducing AEDs phenytoin 
and carbamazepine and the inhibiting AED valproate does not warrant rufinamide dose adjustment for 
any of these AEDs.

To assess the clinical implications of covariates which had statistically significant effect on rufinamide 
exposure with relevance to current labelling guidelines (body weight, formulation and AED co-
administration), a series of PK simulations were performed using parameter estimates from the final PK 
model, rufinamide steady state concentration-time profiles. 
To assess the effect of dosing by body weight and valproate co-administration on rufinamide exposure 
following administration of the oral suspension formulation, simulations were performed for children of 15 
kg titrated to a maximum rufinamide dose of 30 and 45 mg/kg/day (maximum 800 and 1000 mg/day, 
respectively, twice daily) in the presence and absence of valproate, respectively, and in adolescent and 
adult subjects of body weight of 40, 60 and 80 kg titrated to a maximum rufinamide dose of 40 
mg/kg/day rufinamide (maximum 1800 and 2400 and 3200 mg/day, respectively, split twice daily.) 
without concomitant valproate. The simulations presented in Figure 7 show a considerable overlap in 
typical steady state rufinamide concentrations over a dosing interval in 15 kg subjects titrated to a 
maximum rufinamide dose of 30 and 45 mg/kg/day in the presence and absence of valproate, 
respectively. In addition rufinamide concentrations at steady state in 40, 60 and 80 kg body weight 
subjects titrated to a maximum dose of 40 mg/kg/day rufinamide in the absence of valproate show 
considerable overlap. This applies equally to the two bioequivalent marketed formations (Stud E2080-
044-003).

To further assess the effect of dosing by body weight on rufinamide exposure following tablet (all 
subjects) or oral suspension formulation (for younger children of 10 and 20 kg), simulations were 
performed for children of body weight 10, 20 and 30kg kg titrated to a maximum dose of 45 mg/kg/day 
tablet or suspension formulation (maximum 450, 900 and 1350mg/day, respectively, split twice daily)

respectively, tablet formulation (maximum 1800, 2400 and 3600 mg/day, respectively, split twice daily) 
in the absence of any other AEDs. The simulations presented in Figure 8 show an overlap in typical 
steady state rufinamide concentrations over a dosing interval in 10, 20 and 30 kg young children 
administered tablet or suspension formulation titrated to a maximum dose of 45 mg/kg/day with 40, 60

•  Updated Model 
At the CHMP’s request to improve the feasibility of the modelling exercise (see discussion section), the 
aplicant conducted a new population PK analysis on pooled data from 3 selected Phase 3 studies in LGS 
patients (Studies 022, 303 and 304) and 1 single-dose study in healthy subjects (Study E2080- E044-
003). Both fixed and estimated allometric scaling for body weight effect on clearance and volume of 
distribution were evaluated during model development and the objective function with estimated 
allometric exponents (df=2) was only 3.4 points lower compared to that with fixed exponents (Report 
CPMS-E2080-004R-v1). A fixed allometric scaling exponent was chosen for the final PK model, which 
adequately captured rufinamide PK from all 4 studies. This model was fully qualified and validated and 
was used to predict exposure in children < 4 years to guide dosing recommendations in children 1 to < 4 
years old, with maximum doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day with and without concomitant 
valproate, respectively. The parameter estimates of the final PK model are presented in Table 9, 
goodness-of-fit-plots are presented in Figure 14 and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks 
(pcVPC) are presented in Figure 15 (Report CPMS-E2080-004R-v1).

The population basal estimates from the new analysis of 4.27 L/h for CL/F and 44.3 L for V/F are 
comparable with published data by Perucca, et al. (2008) (CL/F=3.00 – 5.55L/h and V/F=52.7 – 81.6 L). 
Overall, the outcome of this new modelling is in close agreement with the previous modelling. We 
acknowledge that the profiles from Study E2080-E044-003 in the previous model are not well captured by 
the model based on pcVPC only; however, the profiles from all remaining 10 studies in that modelling, 
including AE/PT2 and 3 studies in LGS subjects (022, 303 and 304), are well captured. Hence, overall, 
based on composite criteria for model evaluation including Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) plots, pcVPCs, and 
bootstrap findings, the model is well qualified to describe the data.  Additionally, the model was shown to 
predict well the observed rufinamide exposure in children under 4 years old. Thus, the slight bias in the 
pcVPC for one single-dose study, which represents only 2% in the PK dataset, does not meaningfully 
impact the key conclusions and applications of the model. 
Model-derived exposure predictions 
Graphs of dose-normalised exposure indicate that exposure is similar across the full patient population 
and different concomitant anti-epileptic drugs.

•  Weigh based dosing recommendations for LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years 
Using the final PK model rufinamide concentrations at steady state were predicted following 45 
mg/kg/day alone and following 30 mg/kg/day in the presence of valproate in subjects aged 1 to < 4 (for 
50 subjects with median body weight of 11.1 kg for subjects aged 1 to < 2 years and for 50 subjects with 
median body weight of 15.4 kg for subjects aged 2 to < 4 years. Model-predicted individual 
concentrations were overlaid with observed steady state concentrations from subjects aged 4 to 36 years 
in Study 022, which was the core study used to obtain Market Authorization approval in the EU, both in 
the presence and absence of valproate. As depicted in Figure 24, based on the proposed dosing of 45 
mg/kg/day alone or 30 mg/kg/day in the presence of valproate in subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, model 
predicted steady state concentrations in subjects aged 1 to < 4 years were comparable. This is 
demonstrated by the large overlap with concentrations observed in Study 022 in subjects aged ≥ 4 years 
dosed as per the approved SmPC.

For the patient population aged 1 to less than 4 years, a weight based dosing is recomended. For both 
tablet and oral suspension formulations, treatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 
mL/kg/day). As described in the SmPC, each daily dose should be administered in 2 equally divided doses 
separated by approximately 12 hours. 
For the patient population aged 1 to less than 4 years, each dose of the oral suspension should be 
rounded off to the nearest 0.5 mL. The suitability for accurate dosing using the oral syringe with 0.5 mL 
increments is demonstrated in Module 3.2.P.2.4 (Suitability of Dosing Devices for Rufinamide Oral 
Suspension) of the EU dossier. The grading accuracy of the syringe and compliance with Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 
both demonstrate the dosing accuracy of the 20 mL oral syringe. 
This syringe is also CE marked and complies with the requirements of Directive 93/42/EEC.   The smallest 
volume increment of 0.5 mL that can accurately be measured using this syringe corresponds to 20 mg of 
rufinamide.  
For the tablets, daily dose should be rounded off to the nearest 100 mg. Rufinamide tablets comply with 
the requirement on subdivision of tablets according to the Ph. Eur., hence consistency in drug substance 
content of half dosage units is assured. This has been confirmed for all strengths (100 mg, 200 mg and 
400 mg) of rufinamide tablets following the conduct of the test for subdivision of tablets as per the Ph. 
Eur. Monograph. Ease of tablet breaking was demonstrated by the fact that no tablet was rejected during 
testing due to difficulty in breaking. A 100 mg tablet subdivided into 2 halves may be used to administer 
50 mg to patients in the lower range of weight. As indicated in the SmPC, if the patient has difficulty with

The main purpose with the population PK analysis is to provide evidence that the proposed dosing 
regimen in children 1-4 years of age provides similar exposure levels as for the previously approved 
population. In order to predict adequate individual exposure values and derive a correct posology it is 
important that CL/F is well described. It is acknowledged that due to the individual titration based dosing, 
non-normalised exposure can be misleading as different dosing regimens are allowed. The aim of the 
exposure similarity comparison is to assure that the exposure given a maximum dose is similar across 
body sizes (and ages). Hence, it is more informative to evaluate dose-normalized exposure as well as 
simulated exposure given the maximum dose. The graphs of dose-normalised exposure indicate that 
exposure is similar across the full patient population and different concomitant anti-epileptic drugs, 
The PK analysis for the initial model (003R) was conducted using 7272 rufinamide plasma concentration 
observations from a total of 1182 subjects. For Studies 303, 304, and 022 in LGS subjects, 340 
rufinamide plasma concentrations from 154 LGS subjects were available. Other studies contributed 6932 
observations from 1028 subjects. 110 plasma concentrations collected in 24 LGS patients aged 1 to 4 
years were included in the modeling work. This represents merely 1.5% of the total dataset for the initial 
model (003R). The data collected in the target group of patients aged 1 to < 4 years represent 
approximately 2% in the PK dataset corresponding to the updated model (004R) – see discussion below, 
Although the PK data in children 1 to <4 years is limited, the model diagnostics of the updated PK model 
(004R) indicate that the model describes rufinamide PK in children 1 to <4 years sufficiently well. The 
updated PK model is considered adequate for prediction of plasma concentrations for all body sizes (and 
subsequently all ages).

The MAH has provided a pooled population PK analysis to describe the PK of rufinamide in small children, 
including body size relations on CL and V. The general approach is endorsed, however the CHMP raised 
some concerns regarding the model fit to data. The provided visual predictive checks indicate that the 
clearance and volume are not well captured for the single dose data (Study E2080-E044-003 and AE/PT2) 
which are the data that would contain most information regarding volume of distribution. Additionally, the 
parameter estimate of volume of distribution deviates substantially from previously reported values for 
rufinamide (Perucca et al, 2008) which warrants further investigation. During the procedure the Applicant 
was advised to consider using fixed allometric exponents as it appears that the population parameters of 
clearance and volume are insensitive to the value of the exponent which could be an indication of an over 
parameterized model. Alternatively, different exponents for the paediatric and adult population can be 
considered since the relation between body size and drug disposition in the adult population is not 
necessarily quantitatively similar to the relation in children. According to the principle of parsimony, 
estimation of fewer parameters could facilitate more accurate estimation of the remaining parameters.  
During the procedure the MAH has provided an updated population PK model which describes the 
rufinamide PK data well. The new population PK analysis was performed on pooled data from 3 selected 
Phase 3 studies in LGS patients (Studies 022, 303 and 304) and 1 single-dose study in healthy subjects 
(Study E2080- E044-003). Both fixed and estimated allometric scaling for body weight effect on clearance 
and volume of distribution were evaluated during model development and the objective function with 
estimated allometric exponents (df=2) was only 3.4 points lower compared to that with fixed exponents 
(Report CPMS-E2080-004R-v1). A fixed allometric scaling exponent was chosen for the final PK model, 
which adequately captured rufinamide PK from all 4 studies. The goodness-of-fit plots and visual 
predictive checks all indicate an adequate model fit to data. Furthermore, the model parameters are in 
line with previously reported PK parameters for rufinamide. The model is deemed adequate for exposure 
predictions for all body weights (and subsequently all ages) and hence the exposure predictions can be 
used in the evaluation of exposure similarity between age groups and to support the proposed posology 
for Inovelon in LGS patients 1 to <4 years. 
Based on GOF plots and bootstrap findings, the initial model (003R) appeared to be qualified to describe 
already well the data. However, a clear tendency of under estimation of the individual predicted plasma 
concentrations over 20 ng/mL was observed. The predictive performances of the initial model (003R) 
showed clear mis-specifications on the basis of the produced graphs. However these concerns have been 
addressed by the applicant by developing the updated PK model (004R) which describes the rufinamide 
PK data sufficiently well and displays no major model misspecification for any of the included studies. 
The MAH has provided simulations of steady-state concentrations to support the proposed weight based 
dosing. The simulation method is considered adequate. It is agreed that the predicted steady-state 
concentration in LGS patients 1 to < 4 years largely overlap the observed concentrations in study 
CRUF331-022, with a slight tendency towards the lower range of observed concentrations. The proposed 
dosing regimen in combination with valproate is considered acceptable as the predicted exposure in 
patients 1 to <4 years of age does not fall outside of the observed exposure range. 
The Applicant has provided clear description on how weight based dosing will be handled in clinical 
practice when using the oral suspension and the tablet formulation. Dose administration instructions 
included in the SmPC section 4.2 are considered accurate and detailed enough by the CHMP. For each 
strength of the tablet formulation compliance with the requirement on subdivision of tablets according to 
the Ph Eur has been shown. The dose accuracy of the 20 ml oral syringe to be co-packed with the 
suspension has been satisfactorily demonstrated down to the lowest proposed dose volume of 1 ml. 
In line with the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev.2 the feasibility of administration through a feeding tube should be 
addressed. The particle size, viscosity, dosing and rinse volume(s), chemical compatibility of the oral 
medicinal product with the tube material and the risk of physical blockage of the tube should be 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 50/103 
 
  
  
considered. Dose recovery after extrusion needs to be demonstrated using feeding tubes and rinse 
volumes relevant to the target age group(s). The applicant is recommended to evaluate post approval the 
feasibility of administrating the rufinamide oral suspension via an enteral feeding tube; as reflected in 
their letter of recommendation.   
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A population PK model based on an enlarged data set from patients with LGS (including 24 patients 1-4 
years old), other forms of epilepsy and from healthy subjects was presented by the applicant. In order to 
address the CHMP concerns related to the shortcoming of this initial PK model the MAH has provided an 
updated  population  PK  model  which  describes  the  rufinamide  PK  data  well.  The  new  population  PK 
analysis was performed on pooled data from 3 selected Phase 3 studies in LGS patients (Studies 022, 303 
and 304) and 1 single-dose study in healthy subjects (Study E2080- E044-003). Both fixed and estimated 
allometric  scaling  for  body  weight  effect  on  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  were  evaluated  during 
model development and the objective function with estimated allometric exponents (df=2) was only 3.4 
points  lower  compared  to  that  with  fixed  exponents  (Report  CPMS-E2080-004R-v1).  A  fixed  allometric 
scaling exponent was chosen for the final PK model, which adequately captured rufinamide PK from all 4 
studies. The goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks all indicate an adequate model fit to data. 
Furthermore,  the  model  parameters  are  in  line  with  previously  reported  PK  parameters  for  rufinamide. 
The model is deemed adequate for exposure predictions for all body weights (and subsequently all ages) 
and  hence  the  exposure  predictions  can  be  used  in  the  evaluation  of  exposure  similarity  between  age 
groups and to support the proposed posology for Inovelon in LGS patients 1 to <4 years. 
The  proposed  dosing  regimen  in  combination  with  valproate  as  reflected  in  the  SmPC  section  4.2  is 
considered acceptable as the predicted exposure in patients 1 to <4 years of age does not fall outside of 
the  observed  exposure  range.  Dose  administration  instructions  are  considered  accurate  and  detailed 
enough by the CHMP. 
In addition, the applicant is recommended to evaluate post approval the feasibility of administrating the 
rufinamide oral suspension via an enteral feeding tube. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of rufinamide in the adjunctive therapy of LGS in patients older than 4 years of age has been 
previously established based on the results of the pivotal trial 022. Given that the disease expression of 
LGS is similar in adults, older and younger children, the MAH was of the view that efficacy as observed in 
the patients ≥4 years can be extrapolated to patients aged <4 years. 
Supportive data were available from study 303, an open-label safety and PK study in children aged 1 to 
less than 4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Efficacy was an exploratory objective. 
As discussed in section “2 Scientific discussion” above, an overview of the efficacy of rufinamide for the 
proposed paediatric population has been extensively discussed in the initial application 
EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037. No new data was submitted for the current Application. 
From the initial discussions, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy results of study 303 were largely 
inconclusive and did not support a clinically relevant effect of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years. This was mainly due to 
the small study size and the fact that the study was not adequately powered for the performed efficacy 
analyses. Nevertheless, given that LGS disease expression is similar in younger and older children, 
extrapolation of efficacy from patients aged > 4 years might in principle be acceptable. However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 51/103 
 
  
  
 
although the efficacy extrapolation strategy was considered acceptable, use of rufinamid in the targeted 
population is conditioned by the assessment and establishment of an adequate dose (see comments 
below in section 2.4.3). 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose-response studies were conducted which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The MAH stated that the dose regimen of rufinamide used in Study 303 was  shown to be well-tolerated 
and effective in subjects greater than or equal to 4 years of age, and is approved at these doses in the 
tablet form in the European Union and the United States of America, on the basis of results from Study 
022,  which  was  the  pivotal  trial  for  the  initial  approval  of  rufinamide,  using  the  same  dosing  regimen 
(starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day and target maintenance dose of 45 mg/kg/day). 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Title of Study 303: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the 
Cognitive Development Effects and Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Adjunctive Rufinamide 
Treatment in Pediatric Subjects 1 to Less Than 4 Years of Age with Inadequately Controlled 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.Methods 
This study was a 2-year evaluation of primarily the safety and PK of rufinamide as add-on treatment of 
seizures associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age compared to any other approved 
add-on AED of the investigator’s choice.  
The study consisted of 2 phases (see below also Figure 6):  
Pre-randomization Phase: Screening Period and a Baseline Visit (1 to 8 weeks)  
Randomization Phase: Titration + Maintenance (106 weeks), and Taper (2 weeks) Period.  
Only subjects on rufinamide participated in the Taper Period and only those that completed the Taper 
Period at the end of the study had a Final or Follow-up Visit. Subjects that discontinued rufinamide early 
were tapered (if deemed necessary by the investigator) before starting another add-on AED.

Study participants 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion  
•  Age 1 to less than 4 years. 
•  Clinical  diagnosis  of  LGS  at  screening,  which  might  have  included  the  presence  of  a  slow 
background  electroencephalogram  (EEG)  rhythm,  slow  spikes-waves  pattern  (<3  Hz),  the 
presence of polyspikes; care should have been taken not to include benign myoclonic epilepsy of 
infancy, subjects with a diagnosis of atypical benign partial epilepsy (pseudo-Lennox syndrome), 
or continuous spike-waves of slow sleep.  
•  On a fixed and documented dose of 1 to 3 concomitant regionally approved AEDs for a minimum 
of 4 weeks prior to randomization with an inadequate response to treatment.  
•  Consistent seizure documentation (ie, no uncertainty of the presence of seizures) during the 
Prerandomization Phase.  
Exclusion Criteria  
• 
Familial short QT syndrome. 
•  Prior  treatment  with  rufinamide  within  30  days  of  Baseline  Visit  or discontinuation  of  rufinamide 
treatment due to safety issues related to rufinamide.  
•  Any  history  of  or  concomitant  medical  condition  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would 
compromise the subject’s ability to safely complete the study. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 2:1 and received either rufinamide or any 
other approved AED of the investigator’s choice as an add-on to the subject’s existing regimen of 1 to 3 
AEDs for 106 weeks (Titration plus Maintenance Period). 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 53/103 
 
  
  
 
Test drug: Rufinamide oral suspension (40 mg/mL) was administered at a dose up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 
equally divided doses. During the Titration Period, rufinamide was initially administered at 10 mg/kg/day. 
It  was  subsequently  increased  at  10  mg/kg/day  increments  every  3  days  to  40  mg/kg/day,  and  then 
further increased by 5 mg/kg/day to the target maintenance level of 45 mg/kg/day. In case of tolerability 
issues, the drug could be titrated more slowly or titrated to a lower dose at the investigator’s discretion. 
The dose reached at the end of the Titration Period was the dose that the subject should have received 
during the entire Maintenance Period. However, during the Maintenance Period, the dose could have been 
adjusted according to the investigator’s discretion. At the end of the Maintenance Period, rufinamide was 
discontinued.  If  deemed  necessary  by  the  investigator,  discontinuation  could  have  been  done  gradually 
over a period of 2 weeks. 
Comparator: Administration of the add-on AED for subjects randomized to the any other AED treatment 
group  was  performed  according  to  the  investigator’s  usual  practice.  This  included  discontinuation  of  the 
selected add-on AED or replacement with another add-on AED if the initial add-on AED selected was not 
well  tolerated.  Tapering  or  discontinuation  of  the  investigator  selected  add-on  AED  was  performed 
according to the investigator’s usual practice.

• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the effect of 2 drug regimens consisting of either rufinamide or any other approved AED 
of  the  investigator’s  choice  as  an  add-on  to  the  subject’s  existing  regimen  of  1  to  3  AEDs,  on  the

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy variables were Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problems score and change 
from baseline in CBCL Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) treatment period. 
The CBCL is a 99-item questionnaire completed by a parent/legal guardian or appropriate caregiver 
(hereafter referred to as the rater) of the subject. Each item was rated with a 3-point scale indicating how 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 54/103 
 
  
  
often or characteristic it is of the subject. The 99 items were combined to produce scores for 8 problem 
area scales (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, 
attention problems, aggressive behaviour, and other problems) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, 
externalizing, and total problems). Each item should have been rated by the rater as best they can 
without providing any additional instructions other than to explain and clarify the wording of an item if 
needed. The purpose of the scale was to provide t-scores for all problem area scales and the summary 
scores to identify behavioural problems or developmental delays. The Total Problem score is the sum of 
all the problem areas plus 1 additional item. Internalization score is the sum of 4 problem areas that are 
problems within the self, and externalization consists of 2 problem areas involving conflict with other 
people and with their expectations of the child. The t-scores are standardized test scores that indicate the 
same degree of elevation in problems on each of the scales relative to the normative sample of peers. 
Higher scores are indicative of more problems. 
Exploratory  efficacy  variables included time  to  withdrawal  from  treatment,  seizure  frequency,  worsening 
of  seizures,  change  from  baseline  in  CBCL  sub-scores,  Language  Development  Survey  (LDS)  score,  and 
Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QoLCE) total and subscores: 
•  Time  to  withdrawal  from  either  rufinamide  or  investigator’s  choice  of  add-on  AED  because  of 
occurrence of AEs or for lack of efficacy 
•  Percent change in total seizure frequency and in frequency by individual seizure type per 28 days 
by  treatment  group  and  in  multiple  cohorts  of  subjects.  These  cohorts  included  patients  treated 
with  rufinamide  or other-AED  for  at  least  1,  2,  4, 6,  10,  14,  18, 22,  and  26.5  months.  Seizures 
were assessed and recorded by the subject’s parents (s)/caregiver(s). 
• 
Frequency per 28 days was defined as (S/D)*28 where, S = the sum of the seizures reported in 
the  Subject  Seizure  Diary  during  the  specified  time  interval  and  D  =  the  number  of  days  with 
non-missing seizure data in the Subject Seizure Diary for the specified study Phase. 
•  Worsening  of  seizures  (doubling  in  total  seizure  frequency  or  in  frequency  of  major  seizures 
[generalized  tonic-clonic,  drop  attacks]  or  occurrence  of  new  seizure  type)  by  treatment  group 
and  in  multiple  cohorts  of  patients.  These  cohorts  included  patients  treated  with  rufinamide  or 
other-AED for at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.5 months. 
•  Change from baseline in CBCL subscores 
•  Change from baseline in LDS score during Maintenance Period. 
•  The LDS consists of an 8-item questionnaire and a vocabulary list. The form was completed by a 
parent or caregiver who interacted with the subject on a consistent, daily basis. The LDS provided 
2  scores,  an  average  phrase  length  score  and  a  number  of  endorsed  vocabulary  words  score. 
Both  raw  scores  were  used  to  provide  2  normative  scores  based  on  the  child’s  age  in  months. 
Higher scores are indicative of better language development 
•  Change from baseline in total and subscores of QoLCE scale 
•  The  QoLCE  is  a  76-item  questionnaire  designed  specifically  to  measure  QoL  in  children  with 
epilepsy.  The  form  must  have  been  completed  by  a parent  or  caregiver  who  interacted  with  the 
child on a consistent, daily basis. The items were combined into 13 scales and 3 of the items were 
used to represent an overall score in 3 separate areas.

Sparse blood sampling was performed for the determination of plasma rufinamide concentrations during 
the Maintenance Period at Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24, respectively). See section 
2.2. for the results. 
Safety 
AEs  and  the  results  of  clinical  laboratory  assessments,  physical  examinations,  and  vital  signs  were 
employed to assess safety. See section 2.4. for the results. 
Sample size 
Originally, 75 subjects (rufinamide: n=50, any-other-AED: n=25) were planned to be recruited. 
Based on Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessement Preschool Forms & Profiles (Achenbach 
and Rescorla, 2000), the mean raw scores of the Total Problems is 58.8 for referred (with documented 
psychopathological issues) children and 33.4 for non-referred (normal controls) children with standard 
deviations of 26.5 and 18.8 respectively. Using a standard deviation of 23, a total sample size of 75 (50 
on rufinamide and 25 on non- rufinamide) would provide 84% power to detect a difference of 17, which is 
two thirds of the above difference of 58.8 and 33.4 (=25.4), using a two-sided t-test at alpha=0.05. 
The planned number of subjects was later revised to allow a minimum of 21 rufinamide-treated subjects 
(25 rufinamide-treated patients as per the PIP). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to treatments on the basis of a computerized randomisation scheme. Subjects 
were randomized to either rufinamide or any other approved AED in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization was 
performed centrally by Interactive Voice Response System.

Analysis Sets  
The Safety Set included all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of rufinamide or any other 
approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment. The 
Safety Set was based on actual treatment received. 
The PK Analysis Population consisted of all treated subjects who received rufinamide and had at least 1 
valid concentration measurement with adequately documented dosing history. 
The Full Analysis Set for primary efficacy variable included all randomized subjects who received 
rufinamide or any other approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had baseline and at least 1 
post-dose cognition measurement. 
The Full Analysis Set for other efficacy variable included randomized subjects who received rufinamide or 
any other add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had a baseline efficacy assessment and at least 1 
post-baseline efficacy assessment. 
The Full Analysis Sets were based on randomized treatment.

The 2 treatment groups were to be declared significantly different in favor of rufinamide, if the treatment 
effect p value was less than or equal to 0.05 using a 2-sided test, and if the least squares (LS) mean of 
the rufinamide group is less than the LS mean of the any-other-AED group over time (weeks). 
The primary statistical model for comparing the 2 treatment groups was a repeated measures mixed 
model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with compound symmetric covariance structure, with baseline 
score, age, and sex as covariates, and treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction as factors. 
Unstructured covariance was also used to test the sensitivity of the model. Descriptive statistics of the 
mean change from baseline by treatment group and week were presented. LS means differences between 
the 2 treatment groups at each of the scheduled visits were computed. 
To compare the 2 treatment groups at the End of Study, an ANCOVA model was used on the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) with baseline score and age as covariates, and sex and treatment as 
factors. This was done to test the effects of drop-outs on the results. To test the effect of time (week) on 
treatment, treatment groups were compared by excluding treatment by week interaction. 
The percent change in frequency of total seizures and by individual seizure types, per 28 days relative to 
baseline, was compared between treatment groups for each of the cohorts of subjects treated with 
rufinamide or any-other-AED using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with 2-sided 0.05 alpha level. The Hodges-
Lehmann 95% CI of the difference between treatment groups was presented. 
Incidence of worsening of seizures was summarized by treatment group. 
LDS and QoLCE scores were analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy endpoint Total Problems Score. The 
repeated measure mixed ANCOVA model failed to converge with the unstructured covariance structure 
due to small sample sizes. 
Time to withdrawal from treatment (excluding taper) because of occurrence of AEs or for lack of efficacy 
was summarized by treatment group and presented using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Safety Analyses 
Evaluation  of  safety  was  performed  on  the  Safety  Population.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events 
(TEAEs)  were  summarized  by  presenting,  for  each  treatment  group,  the  incidence  of  AEs.  Descriptive 
summary statistics (mean plus standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) of the laboratory, 
and  vital  signs,  and  changes  from  baseline  were  evaluated  by  treatment  group.  Details  on  the  safety 
analyses are provided in section 2.4. 
PK Analyses 
The plasma sample concentration values from this study were merged with comparable data from other 
studies to permit population PK modeling. Details on the PK analyses are provided in section 2.2.

A total of 43 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these 43 subjects, 6 were screening 
failures and 37 were randomized into the study. Of the 6 screen failures, 4 subjects failed to meet 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, 1 subject withdrew consent, and 1 subject was excluded for other reasons.  
All 25 subjects randomized to rufinamide received at least 1 dose of study drug. Of the 25 rufinamide-
treated subjects, 15 rufinamide-treated subjects completed the study. Ten subjects discontinued from the 
study and 1 subject discontinued from rufinamide treatment but completed the study (due to inadequate 
therapeutic effect). Primary reasons for discontinuation from study were due to AE (decreased appetite 
and vomiting, vomiting, SAE of pneumonia that resulted in death), withdrawal of consent, subject choice 
and inadequate therapeutic effect. 
All 12 subjects randomized to the any-other-AED group received at least 1 dose of study drug. Four 
subjects in the any-other-AED group completed the study. Of the 12 subjects treated with any-other-
AED, 8 subjects discontinued from the study. Primary reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow-up, subject choice, inadequate therapeutic effect, and other reason. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was screened on 16 June 2011 and the last subject had the last visit on 2 November 
2015. The study was conducted at 19 study sites in total; sites were in the US (8), Canada (1), France 
(1), Greece (2), Italy (4), and Poland (3).

Conduct of the study 
There  were  2  revisions  and  2  amendments  to  the  original  protocol  (24  Nov  2010,  v1.0).  The  revisions 
corrected  minor  mistakes  and  typographical  errors.  A  summary  of  the  two  amendments  is  provided 
below:  
•  26  Oct  2011,  v4.0  (Amendment  01):  to  satisfy  health  authority  requests,  added  a  minimum  of 
25%  of  rufinamide-treated  subjects  will  be  between  2  and  3  years  of  age  and  that  every  effort 
will be made to include a younger population (between 1 and 3 years of age); revised exclusion 
for prior use of rufinamide; added blood volume required; added instructions if screening visit is 
extended, added duplicate, consecutive electrocardiograms (ECGs) at Visit 2 and Visits 5, 6, and 
7  for  steady  state  and  maximum  observed  concentration  (Cmax);  baseline  ECG  prior  to  dosing 
and  Visits  5,  6,  and  7  approximately  4  to  6  hours  after  drug  administration;  changed  qualified 
designated  reader  to  central  reader  and  additional  clarification  for  screening  ECG;  added 
measurement of head circumference at baseline, Visits 8, 10, 13, and at Follow-up/Final Visit or 
early discontinuation  
•  03 Apr 2013, v5.0 (Amendment 02): reduced from 8 to 4 weeks the minimum required time on 
AEDs  before  randomization,  and  required  that  AED  doses  be  documented;  allowed  historical 
seizure diaries to satisfy inclusion criteria in lieu of seizure diaries that would be compiled during 
the Screening Period, thus allowing the Screening Period to be shortened to expedite recruitment; 
changed criterion for interim analysis compilation to allow reporting of data within the time frame 
requested by regulators, even if fewer than 75 patients have completed 6 months of treatment; 
added  amylase  and  lipase  samples  to  list  of  laboratory  tests  per  United  States  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) request for subject safety. 
Baseline data 
Most subjects were 12 to 35 months old (67.6%) and 32.4% were 36 to 48 months old; a similar 
distribution of age was present in the 2 treatment groups. Time to diagnosis and seizure type were also 
similar in both groups. Types of seizures were comparable in both groups, except for myoclonic seizures 
that were less frequent in percentage in rufinamide group (60.0%) compared to other-AED group 
(83.3%). The majority of subjects were white (86.5%); 10.8% were black or of African descent. The race 
and ethnicity of subjects randomized into this study was a reflection of the racial distribution of the 
patient population in the countries/sites participating in the study.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects with non-missing values in relevant treatment 
group. AED = antiepileptic drug, Max = maximum, Min = minimum. 
a: Age was calculated at date of informed consent. 
b: Subjects could have had more than 1 type of seizure. 
c: Although not specifically categorized as such in the listings, all "absence seizures" were atypical. 
Concomitant medication 
Overall, 8.1% of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were taking 1 AED, 37.8% were taking 2 AEDs, 
45.9% were taking 3 AEDs, 2.7% were taking 4 AEDs, and 5.4% were taking 5 AEDs at baseline. The 
most commonly taken AEDs (≥25% of the subjects in any treatment group) were valproic acid, 
levetiracetam, topiramate, diazepam, vigabatrin, and clobazam. The 2 treatment groups appeared to 
have a similar treatment profile with respect to AEDs other than rufinamide. Differences in percentage 
should be interpreted with caution taking into account the small number of patients. 
Add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization for subjects in the any other AED 
group were lamotrigine (5 [41.7%] subjects), clobazam and topiramate (2 [16.7%] subjects each), 
phenobarbital, valproic acid, and zonisamide (1 [8.3%] subject each).  
To compare the profile of AEDs (other than rufinamide) administered to subjects in both treatment 
groups, the add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization were added to the 
baseline AEDs for subjects in the any-other-AED group, and compared to the baseline AEDs taken by 
subjects in the rufinamide group.

Subjects with 2 or more medications within a class level and drug name were counted only once within that class level 
and drug name. 
AEDs at baseline were defined as AEDs starting prior to first dose date and ending on or after first dose 
date. WHO Drug Dictionary March 2013, version 2. 
AED = antiepileptic drug, WHO = World Health Organization. 
a: Add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization for subjects in the any-other-AED group. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 37 subjects were randomized to receive either rufinamide (n=25) or any other AED (n=12). All 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment and were 
included in the Safety Analysis Set. The Full Analysis Set for the primary efficacy variable and the Full 
Analysis Set for other efficacy variables included 24 of 25 rufinamide-treated subjects and 9 of 12 treated 
subjects in the any-other-AED group. One subject in the rufinamide group and 3 subjects in the in the 
any-other-AED group did not have post-baseline efficacy data and were thus not included. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Results  
The primary efficacy variable was CBCL Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) 
treatment period. The CBCL Total Problems t-Scores mean and mean change from baseline are 
summarized by week in Table 12. The results of the CBCL Total Problems Score treatment comparison at 
Week 106, over time (based on means across Weeks 24, 56, 88, and 106) and the Final Visit using an 
ANCOVA model based on LOCF, with baseline score and age as covariates, and sex and treatment as 
factors are presented in Table 13.

(62.8 [n=8] vs. 56.6 [n=24] with LS mean difference of -5.43).  
There  was  no  consistent  trend  in  change  from  baseline  in  CBCL  Total  Problems  Score  by  week  and 
overall.  LS  mean  of  the  CBCL  t-scores  for  subjects  after  2  years  of  treatment  were  53.75  for  the  any

Exploratory Efficacy Results  
Time to withdrawal  
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median overall survival time to withdrawal from treatment because of 
an AE or lack of efficacy was 142.0 weeks in the rufinamide group and 28.0 weeks in the any-other-AED 
group (Table 14).

a All randomized subjects who received rufinamide or any other approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and 
had baseline and at least 1 post-dose cognition assessment. 
Percent Change in Total Seizure Frequency 
The percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated for each cohort (i.e. patients 
treated with rufinamide or other-AED for at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.5 months) relative to 
baseline. Mean and median baseline seizure frequency was 752.02 and 449.54 in the rufinamide group 
(N=24) and 379.38 and 285.54 in the any other AED group (N=9). The overall median decrease (Min, 
Max) from baseline was 7.05% (79.2, 3644.1) in the rufinamide group and 20.15% (-83.3, 143.1) in the 
any other AED group. The median difference between the rufinamide group and the any other AED group 
was -14.4% (95%CI: -56.20, 15.50). The P value for the difference from the any-other-AED group was 
0.2731. 
Percent change in seizure frequency by individual seizure types (partial seizures, absences, typical 
absences, clonic seizures, tonic-atonic seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and other 
seizures) per 28 days across all cohorts relative to baseline showed no statistically significant differences 
between the 2 treatments groups. However, sample sizes (7-12 patients receiving rufinamide and 1-5 
patients receiving any other AED) were small, affecting the interpretability of these results. 
Worsening of seizures 
Worsening of seizures was summarized by the incidence of subjects with doubling in total seizure 
frequency, doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, drop attacks), or occurrence 
of new seizure type during each successive 3 to 4 month visit interval of the Maintenance Period relative 
to Baseline. 
Across all cohorts in the rufinamide group, 4 of 24 (16.7%) subjects reported a doubling in total seizure 
frequency, 5 of 24 (20.8%) reported a doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, 
drop  attacks),  and  no  subjects  reported  an  occurrence  of  a  new  seizure  type.  Across  all  cohorts  in  the 
any-other-AED  group,  1  of  9  (11.1%)  subjects  reported  doubling  in  total  seizure  frequency  and  a 
doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, drop attacks); no subjects reported an 
occurrence of a new seizure type. 
Change from baseline in LDS score during Maintenance Period 
LDS Average Phrase Length 
The LDS average phrase length can be categorized into delayed phrase development (≤ 20th percentile) 
or  no  delayed  phrase  development  (>20th  percentile).  It  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  total  number  of 
words across all phrases by the number of phrases with greater than 0 words; for subjects with no words, 
the  average  is  0.  At  baseline,  phrase  development  was  delayed  in  all  subjects.  The  delay  in  phrase 
development was severe; hence the baseline score was 0 for all except 3 subjects. 
The  LDS  average  phrase length  did  not  change  notably  in  either treatment  group  during  the  study,  and 
was  delayed  in  all  except  3  subjects  at  the  end  of  treatment;  the  end  of  treatment  score  was  0  for  all 
except  5  subjects.  When  comparing  LDS  average  phrase  length  between  the  2  treatment  groups  at  the 
End of Study using an ANCOVA model on the LOCF with baseline score and age as covariates and sex and 
treatment  as  factors,  the  resulting  treatment  difference  was  0.194  (95%  CI  -0.4,  0.8),  which  is  not 
statistically  significant  (P=0.5156).  When  compared  across  time  using  an  ANCOVA  mixed  model  for 
repeated  measures  with  baseline  score  and  age  as covariates  and  sex,  treatment,  week,  and  treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018

by  week  interaction  as  factors,  the  treatment  difference  of  0.222  (0.303)  (95%  CI  -0.4,  0.8)  is  not 
statistically significant (P=0.4693) 
LDS Vocabulary Score 
The LDS vocabulary score can be categorized into delayed vocabulary development (≤ 15th percentile) or 
no  delayed  vocabulary  development  (>15th  percentile).  Vocabulary  development  was  delayed  in  all 
except 1 subject at baseline, and all except 3 subjects at the end of treatment. The delay in development 
was severe, hence the baseline score was 0 for all except 7 subjects and the end of treatment score was 
0 for all except 9 subjects. 
The treatment difference of 12.450 (95% CI: -27.0, 51.9), when the 2 treatment groups was compared 
at the End of Study using an ANCOVA model on the LOCF with baseline score and age as covariates and 
sex  and  treatment  as  factors,  was  not  statistically  significant  (P=0.5237).  The  LDS  vocabulary  score  in 
the  2  treatment  groups  was  also  compared  across  time  using  an  ANCOVA  mixed  model  for  repeated 
measures  with  baseline  score  and  age  as  covariates  and  sex,  treatment,  week,  and  treatment  by  week 
interaction  as  factors.  The  treatment  difference  of  13.629  (95%  CI:  -10.0,  37.3)  was  not  statistically 
significant (P=0.2497). 
Change from Baseline in Total and Sub-Scores of QoLCE Scale 
At baseline, the mean total score of QoLCE was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 
little changes from the baseline by the end of treatment, mean (SD) changes at the end of treatment 
were -0.3 (7.87) for rufinamide and 1.4 (1.81) for any other AED.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In order to support the present application to expand the indication of Inovelon to paediatric patients 
from 1 year to less than 4 years of age, the MAH made reference to the established benefit-risk profile in 
patients 4 years of age and older and the fact that the clinical expression of LGS is similar in the younger 
population compared to older children and adults. Supportive data were available from a multicentre, 
multiple-dose, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel group study (study 303), which provides a 2-
year evaluation of the safety, PK, and cognitive/behavioural effects of rufinamide as add-on treatment for 
control of seizures associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age compared to any other 
approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice. 
Based on these data as well as pop PK modelling, extrapolation of the efficacy of rufinamide from older 
children and adults to younger children aged 1 to less than 4 years was proposed by the MAH. The CHMP 
agreed that the expression of LGS was similar in the younger population compared to older patients, and 
that there was no reason to expect that the effect of rufinamide on children between the ages of 1 and 4 
years would differ from that in older children and adults, although it was noted that the diagnosis of LGS 
can be challenging in the very young children. Thus, in principle, extrapolation of efficacy as previously 
established in children ≥ 4 years could be acceptable provided an adequate dose can be established. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 303 was included in the PIP of Inovelon and the design had previously been endorsed as 
appropriate to demonstrate the agreed objectives. The study aimed at to comparing the effect of 2 drug 
regimens consisting of either rufinamide or any other approved AED of the investigator’s choice as an 
add-on to the subject’s existing regimen of 1-3 AEDs on the overall safety and tolerability of rufinamide in 
subjects aged 1 to less than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS. Other objectives were to 
characterize age group-specific PK and to evaluate cognitive development and behavioural effects and 
other exploratory efficacy variables. 
The diagnosis of LGS was established according to the International League Against Epilepsy’s 
Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ILAE, 2010) except for the EEG criteria. The ILAE criteria were 
adapted from the requirement of presence of slow spike-and-waves and burst of fast rhythms to ‘a 
clinical diagnosis of at screening, which might have included the presence of a slow background EEG 
rhythm, slow spikes-waves pattern (<3 Hz), the presence of polyspikes (…)’. This widening of the 
inclusion criteria was done to account for the fact that at such an early age (1 to less than 4 years), 
diagnosis of LGS can be very difficult due to varying stages of brain maturation and disease development 
and not all the cardinal EEG signs and symptoms may be present at the same time in this age group. 
While the CHMP acknowledged the difficulties in diagnosis, the lack of specific EEG requirements created 
uncertainties in the recruited patient population and if patients with other epileptic syndrome than LGS 
could have been enrolled. To address this concern, the MAH retrospectively requested participating study 
sites to provide EEG documentation. Information from 27 subjects (72% of all enrolled patients) was 
received. All of these subjects had EEG and clinical features consistent with LGS, which was considered 
reassuring by the CHMP.

The originally planned study size of 75 patients was reduced to a total of 37 patients (25 treated with 
rufinamide) due to difficulties in the recruitment related to the rarity of the condition, the diagnostic 
process specifically in the younger age group and the availability of the product on the market. The 
difficulties were acknowledged by the CHMP; however, the small number of study subjects randomised 
(and even smaller number of subjects completing the 2-year treatment period of 15/24 subjects in the 
rufinamide group and 4/12 subjects in the any-other-other AED group) made it difficult to interpret the 
study results, in particular with regards to efficacy. 
Baseline distribution of age was similar in the 2 treatment groups; most subjects were 12 to 35 months 
old (67.6%) and 32.4% were 36 to 48 months old. Time to diagnosis and seizure type were also similar 
in both groups. Types of seizures were comparable in both groups, except for myoclonic seizures that 
were less frequent in percentage in rufinamide group (60.0%) compared to other-AED group (83.3%). In 
this context, the CHMP noted the high number of patients in the study with myoclonic seizures (68%) in 
the study which are not frequent in typical LGS syndrome. Finally, most patients were taking 2 (37.8%) 
and 3 (45.9%) concomitant AEDs at baseline. Both treatment groups appeared to have a similar 
treatment profile with respect to AEDs other than rufinamide. 
Dose recommendations 
In study 303, rufinamide was administered as oral suspension (40 mg/mL). During the Titration Period, 
rufinamide was administered at 10 mg/kg/day (administered in 2 equally divided doses) and the dose 
was increased at 10 mg/kg/day increments every 3 days to 40 mg/kg/day, then increased by 5 
mg/kg/day to the target maintenance level of 45 mg/kg/day. No dose finding study had been conducted. 
The choice of the dose in study 303 was the same as in study 022, the pivotal trial for the initial approval 
of rufinamide for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 
years of age and older. 
Indeed, in study 303, rufinamide was not administered as per the current EU approved dosing 
recommendations for patients <30 kg where a daily dose of 200 mg is recommended for treatment 
initiation. Rather rufinamide was dosed in line the FDA US labelling. This schedule was similar to the one 
used in study 022 (pivotal trial for the initial MAA of Inovelon), which formed the basis for the current EU 
posology in patients aged 4 years and older. However, as highlighted in the initial application, patients in 
study 303 weight substantially less (mean weight: 12.78 kg, Min, Max: 7.0, 19.0) than in study 022 
(mean weight: 42.3 kg, Min, Max: 15.5, 138.5). Maximum weight based doses in study 303 were thus 
always below the doses that would be achieved when applying the approved EU posology. Even if similar 
exposure in the younger children (1-4 years) compared to the older ones can be shown, the current EU 
approved dosing scheme is not optimal.  
Thus, the weight based dosing regimen for the younger children as applied in the studies 303 and 022 
and mentioned in the FDA US labelling (either dose/kg) would be appropriate. The proposed wording in 
the Product information is in line with the proposed weight based dosing regimen. 
As stated in the adopted PIP, the dose regimen of rufinamide used in this study was shown to be well-
tolerated and effective in subjects ≥ 4 years of age, and is approved at these doses in the tablet form in 
the EU and US, on the basis of results from Study CRUF331 0022 (efficacy and safety of rufinamide as 
adjunctive therapy in subjects with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS). Study 
CRUF331 0022 was the primary basis for approval of rufinamide, using this dosing regimen (45 
mg/kg/day for 28 days during the 3 year extension) and patient population (LGS). The oral suspension 
(OS) was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the tablet and well tolerated in studies comparing tablet 
and suspension formulations.

For the primary efficacy variable, LS mean difference in the CBCL Total Problems Score compared to 
baseline, the scores at the Final Visit (Week 106) were comparable in the rufinamide (56.35) and any 
other AED group (53.75) with slightly more problems for the rufinamide subjects compared with the any-
other-AED group (LS mean difference [95% CI]: +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928). Analyses across time 
(LS mean difference [95% CI]: -1.197 [95% -7.6, 5.3]; p =0.7083) and at the End of Study, based on 
LOCF (treatment difference [95% CI]: -2.776 [-13.3, 7.8]; p =0.5939) were not statistically significant 
either. The baseline mean score for the any other AED group was higher compared with the rufinamide 
group (62.8 [n=8] versus 56.6 [n=24] with LS mean difference of -5.43). Overall, there was no 
consistent trend for the change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems Score over time. There was also no 
major trend in mean CBCL sub-scores and mean change from baseline in CBCL sub-scores in the 2 
treatment groups throughout the study. 
Based on the sample size calculation, the CHMP noted that a minimum difference in CBCL Total Problem 
Score of at least 17 in favour of rufinamide was expected. This effect is rather large and a notable 
difference between the expected (-17) and observed (+2.6) outcome for the primary clinical endpoint 
was apparent. Based on the experience from other (not epilepsy) behaviour health studies, this change in 
CBCL total score was assumed to bring down the rufinamide score closer to normal values compared to 
the any other AED arm where scores were expected to be relatively steady. However, it appears that due 
to the lack of experience with the use of the CBCL scale in the paediatric population recruited in study 
303, this difference was overestimated and clearly out of reach. There was also a large variability in the 
scores of some patients in both treatment arms during and at the end of treatment. Due to the small size 
of the study, the results were considered inconclusive. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included time to withdrawal from treatment because of an AE or lack of 
efficacy, which was 142.0 weeks (median Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival) in the rufinamide 
group and 28.0 weeks in the any-other-AED group. However, a time-to-withdrawal analysis taking into 
account 2 of the reasons for discontinuation (adverse event and lack of efficacy) was not considered 
reliable by the CHMP. Too few of the targeted events have been observed in the course of the trial (2 
discontinuations in each arm). In response to a question by the CHMP, new analyses were performed 
including the taper period and considering all subjects who discontinued treatment for any reason (10 in 
the rufinamide arm and 5 in the any other AED arm). In this analysis, the median time-to-withdrawal in 
the any other AED arm was 62.9 weeks while it was not reached previously. On the contrary, when 
limiting the analysis again to AEs and lack of efficacy as withdrawal events (6 in the rufinamide arm and 3 
in the any other AED arm), no median time-to-withdrawal was reached in the any other AED arm (i.e. 
less than half of the subjects experienced AE or lack of efficacy) while it was 28 weeks in the original 
analysis. The results were considered difficult to interpret and overall inconclusive due to the small size of 
the trial. 
With regards to seizure outcomes, no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments groups 
in the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline was observed. The overall 
median decrease in total seizure frequency from baseline was lower in the rufinamide group (7.05%) than 
in the any other AED group (20.15%). The median difference between the rufinamide group and the any-
other-AED group was -14.4% (P value= 0.2731). This finding was explained by the MAH by the small size 
of the trial and variability of seizure frequency among different time-points. A comparison of the number 
of variables between the two treatment groups such as individual characteristics, number and type of 
AEDs at baseline, frequency of seizures at baseline, and time in the study did not reveal any other 
possible cause that account for the observed difference. Due to the small size of the study, the results 
were considered inconclusive. 
Concerning worsening of seizures, in the rufinamide group, 4 of 24 (16.7%) subjects reported a doubling 
in total seizure frequency, 5 of 24 (20.8%) reported a doubling in frequency of major seizures 
(generalized tonic-clonic, drop attacks), and no subjects reported an occurrence of a new seizure type. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 73/103 
 
  
  
the any other AED group, 1 of 9 (11.1%) subjects reported doubling in total seizure frequency and 1 of 9 
(11.1%) subjects reported a doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, drop 
attacks); no subjects reported an occurrence of a new seizure type. 
The LDS average phrase length did not change notably in either treatment group during the study. At the 
end of the study, the treatment difference of 0.194 (95% CI -0.4, 0.8) was not statistically significant 
(P=0.5156). The treatment difference of 12.450 (95% CI -27.0, 51.9) at the End of study in the LDS 
vocabulary score was also not statistically significant (P=0.5237). Finally, there were no notable changes 
from baseline in total score of QoLCE. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Rufinamide film-coated tablets were first approved in the EU via the Centralised Procedure in 2007 for 
use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years of age and 
older. In support of the sought broadening of the indication to include pediatric patients from 1 year to 
less than 4 the MAH has submitted the results of an open label safety study (Study E2080-G000-303; 
[Study 303]). All results should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample sizes and 
methodological limitations of the clinical design. 
As discussed above in section 2.4 Clinical efficacy, no new efficacy data have been submitted within this 
new application. Efficacy part is based on the previous submitted data and discussions. Thus, as 
concluded by the CHMP at the time of the first submission, efficacy results of study 303 were largely 
inconclusive and did not support a clinically relevant effect of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years. This was mainly due to 
the small study size and the fact that the study was not adequately powered for the performed efficacy 
analyses. Nevertheless, given that LGS disease expression is similar in younger and older children, 
extrapolation of efficacy from patients aged > 4 years might in principle be accepted. 
The weight based dosing regimen for the younger children as applied in the studies 303 and 022 and 
mentioned in the FDA US labelling (either dose/kg) would be appropriate provided that the newly 
proposed PK data analysis support a posology yielding similar exposure as in adults, where clinical 
efficacy was directly studied. Indeed, an update of the population-PK modelling including paediatric data 
(1-4 years) and other data collected in older children, adolescent and adults with LGS are also provided. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
As discussed above in section 2.4 Clinical efficacy, no new safety data have been submitted within this 
new application 
The primary safety data supporting the present application are data from study 303. Evaluation of safety 
was performed on the Safety Population. The Safety Set included all enrolled subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of rufinamide or any other approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had at least 
one post-dose safety assessment. 
Pertinent safety data consisted of previously collected and reviewed data from study 022, the pivotal trial 
supporting the initial marketing authorisation for Inovelon and its use as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years of age and older, and data from study 304, 
a Phase 3, controlled study in LGS conducted in Japan to support marketing application in that country 
(see Table 1 for an overview of clinical trials). 
In these studies, rufinamide treatment has been associated with CNS adverse reactions including 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 74/103 
 
  
  
dizziness, somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances. Other important identified risks in the RMP include 
status epilepticus, rash and hypersensitivity, decreased appetite and weight loss, diplopia and blurred 
vision and vomiting. In patients aged 4 years and older, the most common adverse reactions observed at 
a higher incidence than placebo in patients with LGS were somnolence and vomiting (both very 
commonly). The discontinuation rate in LGS due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving 
rufinamide and 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in 
discontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting. 
A summary of the key findings from study 303 is provided in this report section. Safety data from study 
303 are also compared to safety findings in older paediatric subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age from 
study 022. A brief summary of the safety data from study 304 is also given. 
Safety assessments in study 303 consisted of monitoring and recording all AEs and serious AEs (SAEs); 
regular monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry (including amylase and lipase), and urine values; 
periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and performance of physical examinations. 
AEs were graded by seriousness and severity. Relationship to study treatment was assessed based on 
temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment, the course of the 
event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as 
applicable, whether the event was known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments, the presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event, and the presence of non-study, treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event. A related AE was considered an event for which a causal relationship between 
the study drug and the AE is a reasonable possibility. 
Patient exposure 
All of the 37 subjects randomized in study 303 received at least 1 dose of study drug and thus together 
constituted the Safety Set (25 subjects receiving rufinamide and 12 subjects receiving any other AED). 
In the rufinamide arm, 22 (88%) of subjects had at least 16 weeks of exposure in the study, 21 (84%) 
subjects had at least 24 weeks of exposure, and 19 (76%) subjects had at least 56 weeks of exposure. 
The maximum exposure to rufinamide was 146.1 weeks. The total exposure to rufinamide was 2191.3 
subject-weeks. In the any-other-AED arm, 9 (75%) of subjects had at least 16 weeks of exposure in the 
study, 8 (66.7%) subjects had at least 24 weeks of exposure, and 6 (50%) subjects had at least 56 
weeks of exposure. The maximum exposure to any-other-AED was 107.9 weeks. The total exposure to 
any-other-AED was 653.7 subject-weeks. 
A total of 11 (44%) subjects had 106 weeks of exposure in the rufinamide arm compared to 4 (33%) 
subjects in the any other AED group. The mean duration of exposure was higher in the rufinamide group 
(87.65 weeks) compared with the any other AED group (54.48 weeks). 
The median average daily doses of rufinamide were 328.6 mg during the Titration Period, 518.1 mg 
during the Maintenance Period, and 213.9 mg during the Taper Period. During the Maintenance Period, 
79.2% of subjects received rufinamide at a dose of greater than or equal to 40 mg/kg/day. 
For an overview of demographic and baseline characteristics, including use of concomitant AEDs, see 
section 2.4.2 in this report. 
Adverse events 
Study 303 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar in the rufinamide group 
(22 of 25 subjects [88.0%]) and the any other AED group (10 of 12 subjects [83.3%]).

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment group (occurring in ≥10% of subjects) 
were  vomiting  (28.0%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (28.0%),  pneumonia  and  somnolence  (20.0% 
each),  and  sinusitis,  otitis  media,  diarrhoea,  cough,  and  pyrexia  (16.0%  each)  and  bronchitis, 
constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each). 
In  the  any  other  AED  group,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (33.3%),  diarrhea,  seizure,  and  pyrexia 
(25.0% each), and cough (16.7%) were the most common TEAEs (occurring in >1 subject). 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 76/103 
 
  
  
 
 
Approximately  half  of  all  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  (13  of  25  [52.0%]  in  the  rufinamide  group 
and  6  of  12  [50.0%]  in  the  any  other  AED  group)  experienced  TEAEs  that  were  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  drug.  Vomiting  (5  of  25  [20.0%]  subjects)  and 
somnolence (4 of 25 [16.0%] subjects) were the only treatment-related TEAEs reported in more than 2 
subjects in the rufinamide group. Pyrexia and upper respiratory tract infection (2 of 12 [16.7%] subjects 
each)  were  the  only  treatment-related  TEAEs  reported  in  more  than  1  subject  in  the  any-other-AED 
group. 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had TEAEs that were considered mild (4 of 25 [16.0%] 
in the rufinamide group and 4 of 12 [33.3%] in the any other AED group) or moderate (14 of 25 [56.0%] 
in  the  rufinamide  group  and  4  of  12  [33.3%]  in  the  any  other  AED  group)  by  the  investigators.  Both 
groups  had  similar  overall  incidences  of  severe  TEAEs:  4  subjects  (16.0%)  in  the  rufinamide  group 
experienced  severe  TEAEs  (1  bronchitis  and  pneumonia  aspiration,  1  encephalitis  and  pneumonia 
influenzal, 1 pneumonia, and 1 weight decreased) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (16.7%) (1 
seizure and 1 rash). 
Study 022 and study 304 
Amongst  the  subjects  4  to  less  than  12  years  of  age  in  study  022,  28  of  31  (90.3%)  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide group and 30 of 33 (90.9%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 TEAE. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment groups were pyrexia (25.8%), vomiting 
(22.6%),  somnolence  (16.1%),  and  diarrhea  (12.9%).  The  PK  analyses  revealed  that  patients  who 
experienced  somnolence,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  or  diarrhea  did  not  have  higher  rufinamide  exposure  than 
patients who did not experience these AEs. 
For  study  304, the  incidence  of  AEs  was  93.1%  (27 of  29  subjects)  in  the  rufinamide  group  and  70.0% 
(21 of 30) in the placebo group. Frequent AEs that occurred in the rufinamide group were nasopharyngitis 
(9  of  29  [31.0%]  subjects),  status  epilepticus  (8  of  29  [27.6%]  subjects),  decreased  appetite  (6  of  29 
[20.7%] subjects), somnolence (6 of 29 [20.7%] subjects), and vomiting (5 of 29 [17.2%] subjects). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious AEs 
Study 303 
Ten (10) of 25 (40.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 5 of 12 (41.7%) subjects in the any-other-
AED group had SAEs. SAEs reported by more than 1 subject were bronchopneumonia (1 subject in each 
group), seizure (1 subject in the rufinamide group and 3 subjects in the any other AED group), status 
epilepticus (2 subjects in the rufinamide group), and respiratory distress (2 subjects in the rufinamide 
group and 1 subject in the any other AED group). 
Treatment-related SAEs occurred in 3 subjects in the rufinamide group (pneumonia aspiration, status 
epilepticus, and bronchopneumonia) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (seizure and lethargy). 
Deaths 
In Study 303, an AE leading to death (pneumonia) occurred in 1 subject in the rufinamide group. Study 
drug was taken until death (994 days of treatment). The subject was a 23-month old male experiencing 
cough, fever, and being described as sleepy. He was subsequently hospitalized owing to an SAE of severe 
pneumonia and subsequently died despite treatment. The event was considered not related to study 
drug. 
Other significant AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 77/103 
 
  
  
Other significant AEs were defined as any AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug, AEs requiring 
study drug dose adjustment or interruption, AEs resulting in significant treatment-emergent laboratory 
abnormality, AEs associated with overdose and other treatment-emergent events of interest (ie, cardiac 
and ECG). 
Study 303 
A total of 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 of 12 (8.3%) subjects in the any-other-
AED group had TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation from study drug. In the rufinamide group, 1 subject 
discontinued treatment during the Maintenance Phase due to TEAEs of vomiting and decreased appetite 
and 1 subject discontinued treatment during the Titration Phase due to a TEAE of vomiting. In the any-
other-AED group, 1 subject discontinued treatment during the Titration Phase due to a TEAE of rash. 
Discontinuation due to AE was more frequent in the rufinamide group. 
A total of 8 out of the 25 (32.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 3 of the 12 (25.0%) subjects in 
the any other AED group had TEAEs requiring study drug dose adjustment or interruption. The most 
common TEAEs (occurring in more than 1 subject) in the rufinamide group resulting in dose adjustment 
or interruption were weight decreased (2 subjects) and decreased appetite (2 subjects). In the any other 
AED group, seizure (2 subjects) was the only TEAE that occurred in more than 1 subject and resulted in 
dose adjustment or interruption. 
Furthermore, 4 of 25 (16.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group had TEAEs resulting in significant 
laboratory abnormalities, as defined by the statistical analysis plan: blood bicarbonate decreased (2 
subjects), blood triglycerides increased (1 subject), haemoglobin decreased (1 subject), and 
hypoglycemia (1 subject). One of 12 (8.3%) subjects in the any other AED group had a TEAE of blood 
bicarbonate decreased. 
Other reported TEAEs of special interest in the rufinamide group were weight loss (2 of 25 [8.0%] 
subjects), skin reactions (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), somnolence (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), and fatigue 
(1 of 25 [4.0%] subjects). Reported TEAEs of special interest in the any other AED group were skin 
reactions and fatigue (1 of 12 [8.3%] subjects each). 
Study 022 and study 304 
Amongst the subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age in study 022, non-fatal SAEs occurred in 1 subject in 
the rufinamide group (diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting) and 2 subjects in the 
placebo group (sinusitis in 1 subject and petit mal epilepsy in 1 subject). No SAEs reported in this age 
group were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug and none resulted in 
discontinuation from study treatment. 
A total of 3 subjects in the rufinamide group (none in the placebo group) prematurely discontinued due to 
an AE: somnolence (related to study treatment), pneumonia (not related), and dermatitis (related). 
For study 304, non-fatal SAEs of drug eruption occurred in 1 subject each in the rufinamide group and 
the placebo group, both of which were determined by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
No other SAEs occurred during the study. 
A total of 4 subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 subject in the placebo group had TEAEs that resulted 
in discontinuation of study treatment. 
No data had been collected on TEAEs that required study drug dose adjustment or interruption from study 
and on AEs of special importance from either study 022 or study 304. 
No deaths had been reported during study treatment in either study.

Laboratory findings 
Findings  related  to  marked  abnormal  laboratory  values  are  summarized  below.  A  markedly  abnormal 
laboratory value was defined as, for phosphate, a post-baseline value with an increase from baseline to a 
grade of 3 or more and for all other parameters, a post-baseline value with an increase from baseline to a 
grade of 2 or more as defined in the statistical analysis plan. 
Haematology 
Notably low hemoglobin values were reported for 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and no 
subjects in the any other AED group. No other markedly abnormal hematology results were observed. 
Clinical chemistry 
Notably  low  values  were  observed  for  the  parameters  of  bicarbonate  (5  of  25  [20.0%]  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide  group,  4  of  12  [33.3%]  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group)  and  glucose  (1  of  25  [4.0%] 
subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group,  no  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group).  Notably  high  values  of 
potassium were observed in 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and no subjects in the any 
other AED group. No other markedly abnormal clinical chemistry results were observed. 
Urinalysis 
No changes of clinical importance were reported in mean urinalysis values over time, for any parameter. 
Vital Signs, Weight, Physical Examination Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Study 303 
Vitals Signs 
In  the  25  rufinamide-treated  subjects  and  12  subjects  treated  in  the  any  other  AED  group,  notably  low 
values  for  systolic  blood  pressure  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  were  observed  for  8  (32.0%)  and  7 
(28.0%)  subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  and  1  (8.3%)  and  2  (16.7%)  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED 
group,  respectively.  Notably  high  pulse  rates  were  observed  for  12  (48.0%)  subjects  in  the  rufinamide 
group  and  no  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group.  Although  there  were  single  instances  of  clinically 
notable  high  and  low  values  for  systolic  blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood  pressure,  and  pulse  rates, 
occurring  at  a  similar  incidence  in  both  treatment  groups,  none  were  sustained  and  none  required 
additional treatment. 
Weight 
Notably low and notably high weight values were observed for 7 (28.0%) and 17 (68.0%) subjects in the 
rufinamide  group  and  1  (8.3%)  and  9  (75.0%)  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group,  respectively. 
Amongst the 7 cases of  weight loss in the rufinamide group, 3 were considered by the MAH as possibly 
related  to  the  rufinamide  treatment.  These  events  were  all  associated  with  decreased  appetite  and/or 
vomiting, mild or moderated in intensity and spontaneously resolved. 
Mean (SD) weight values at baseline for subjects in the rufinamide group and any other AED group were 
12.47  (3.24)  kg  and  13.43  (2.81)  kg,  respectively.  Mean  increases  in  weight  from  baseline  to  end  of 
treatment  were  observed  for  subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  (2.50  [2.91]  kg)  and  the  any  other  AED 
group (2.79 [3.46] kg). 
ECG and Corrected QT Interval 
There  were  no  clinically  important  changes  in  mean  ECG  parameters  from  baseline  to  the  end  of 
treatment for any treatment group. There were no clinically significant results observed for corrected QT 
values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 79/103 
 
  
  
Study 022 and study 304 
For the subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age in study 022, mean and median changes in haematology, 
chemistry  and  urinalysis  values  and  vital  signs  between  baseline  and  the  termination  visit  were  small, 
similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups,  and  not  clinically  meaningful.  There  were  no  data  available  on 
laboratory  values  reported  as  AEs  from  study  022.  Vital  sign-related  AEs  were  observed  in  1  of  29 
subjects in the rufinamide group (blood pressure increased) and in 2 of 30 subjects in the placebo group 
(blood pressure increased and blood pressure decreased in 1 subject each). Results were similar between 
the rufinamide group and the placebo group. 
For study 304, there were no serious or significant AEs related to laboratory values. AEs related to 
laboratory values were observed in 1 of 29 subjects in the rufinamide group (gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased) and 3 of 30 subjects in the placebo group (blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, lymphocyte 
count decreased, platelet count decreased). Vital sign-related AEs were observed in 1 of 29 subjects in 
the rufinamide group (blood pressure increased) and in 2 of 30 subjects in the placebo group (blood 
pressure increased and blood pressure decreased in 1 subject each). There were no clinically relevant 
percent changes in any ECG variable in either treatment group. No ECG abnormalities were observed at 
any assessment time point. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information in relation to drug-drug interactions was derived from study 303.Analyses from 
previous studies have shown decreased clearance of rufinamide when co-administered with valproic acid. 
The effect of valproic acid on the PK of rufinamide may be clinically relevant in extreme circumstances 
(e.g., in children on high doses of both compounds) and may lead to clinically significant elevation of 
rufinamide levels (by 70% or more). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
See ‘other significant events’. 
Post marketing experience 
Rufinamide was first approved via the Centralised Procedure on 16 January 2007 (International Birth 
Date) in the EU, for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 
years and older. Cumulatively, rufinamide 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg tablets have been approved for 
marketing in over 40 countries, while rufinamide 40 mg/mL oral suspension (OS) has been approved for 
marketing in 34 countries. Rufinamide is sold under the trade names Inovelon and Banzel. 
The use of rufinamide in children aged 1 year and over was approved by the FDA in February 2015. 
As  highlighted  above,  no  new  safety/efficacy  data  was  submitted  as  part  of  this  application,  even  with 
respect  to  post-marketing  experience.  From  the  initial  application,  a  search  based  on  the  global 
rufinamide  adverse  event report  database  for  Spontaneous  Serious  and  Non-serious  and  Solicited  SADR 
Reports of Events in Paediatric Age (<4 Years of Age), when an age was provided by the reporter for the 
period 08 Jan 2015 through 31 August 2016, was provided.  
The  search  revealed  8  reports  (5  serious)  describing  18  adverse  events  received  in  this  age  group. 
According  to  the  applicant,  the  review  of  these  reports  is  consistent  with  the  underlying  disease  of  this 
patient  population  and  with  the  safety  profile  of  rufinamide  described  in  the  product  information  for 
children aged ≥ 4 years of age.

Moreover, data on cumulatively events was provided by the reporter from the IBD January 2007 through 
31 August 2016 (see Table 19 below). According to this database, it seems that there have been 36 
reports in this age group, 19 of which were serious.  
Review of these cases indicates that events in the SOCs of Nervous System Disorders and Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders appear to have the highest reporting rate in those younger than 4 years of 
age, consistent with the underlying disease of this patient population and with the safety profile of 
rufinamide described in the product information for children aged ≥ 4 years of age.

AT the CHMP’s request rufinamide post-marketing safety data (for Spontaneous Serious and Non-serious 
and  Solicited  SADR  reports)  contaning  reports  received  from  a  data  lock  point  (DLP)  of  31  Aug  2016 
through 13 Nov 2017 was submitted. 
During the reporting period of 31 Aug 2016 through 13 Nov 2017 there have been a total of 4 reports (all 
non-serious) associated with use in a child less than 4 years of age; 3 of the 4 reports were from a single 
literature  article.  Review  of  these  cases  indicates  that  events  in  those  younger  than  4  years  of  age 
continue to be consistent with the underlying disease of this patient population and with the safety profile 
of rufinamide described in the product information for children aged ≥ 4 years of age. These 4 cases are 
summarized in Table 20.

Children 4 to Less than 17 Years of Age 
At  the  time  of  the  initial  application,  the  search  returned  a  total  of  260  individual  case  safety  reports 
including 278 AEs. A total of 92 of the 163 reports met serious criteria. Most events were reported only 
once. The most frequently reported events were convulsion (27 reports), vomiting (20 reports), rash (13 
reports), nausea (9 reports), status epilepticus (7 reports), abnormal behavior and decreased appetite (6 
reports  each).  The  SAEs  reported  most  frequently  included  convulsion  (27  reports),  vomiting  (10 
reports), status epilepticus (7 reports), and rash (5 reports). Most patients had a complete recovery from 
the  event.  In  the  reports  where  dosage  was  provided,  800  mg  was  the  dose  at  which  most  patients 
experienced the event. Latency ranged from 1 day to 5 years. 
Children 1 to Less Than 4 Years of Age 
At the time of the initial application, the search returned a total of 26 individual case safety reports with 
49 AEs. A total of 13 of 26 reports met serious criteria. Most events were reported only once. The events 
reported  more  than  once  were  convulsion  (6  reports),  rash  (4  reports),  decreased  appetite  (3  reports), 
and  vomiting  (2  reports).  The  only  SAE  reported  more  than  once  was  convulsion  (6  reports).  Most 
patients  had  a  complete  recovery  from  the  event.  The  majority  of  the  reports  did  not  report  the  dose 
administered. The latency ranged from 1 day to 420 days. 
During  the  course  of  the  initial  procedure  an  update  of  post-marketing  experience  was  provided  for  the 
period of 08 Jan 2015 through 31 August 2016. In the age group of < 4 year olds, the search revealed 8 
reports (5 serious) describing 18 AEs. One case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 3-year old male patient 
with  positive  de-challenge.  The  investigator  classified  the  event  as  possibly  related  to  Inovelon  therapy. 
However, due to a past medical history significant for myotonia and concomitant medications which have 
the  potential  to  cause  rhabdomyolysis,  the  role  of  rufinamide  could  not  be  confirmed.  No  other  case  of 
rhabdomyolysis has been reported with rufinamide.

A  cumulative  summary  table  of  serious  reactions  from  spontaneous  sources,  as  well  as  serious  adverse 
reactions  from  non-interventional  studies  and  other  non-interventional  solicited  sources  that  have  been 
reported  from  marketing  approval  (IBD)  to  13  Nov  2017,  is  presented  below.  Cumulatively  there  have 
been  19  serious  reports  describing  43  serious  events  in  children  less  than  4  years  of  age,  with  ages 
ranging from 4 months to < 4  years of age. More than  half of the patients were male.  Latency ranged 
between hours to just over 1 year. None had fatal outcomes and the majority had outcomes of complete 
recovery  or  improvement.  Of  the  19  reports,  18  reported  concomitant  medications,  mostly  other  anti- 
epileptics;  in  4  of  these  18  cases  another  medication  was  considered  co-suspect.  One  of  the  19  reports 
(nephrotic syndrome) was considered to be ‘Not Related’ by the reporter. 
As  would  be  expected  for this  indication,  the  SOC  of  nervous  system  disorder has  the  highest  reporting 
rate  of  serious  adverse  reactions  in  those  younger  than  4  years  of  age.  The  most  commonly  reported 
serious  adverse  events  in  the  nervous  system  disorders  SOC  was  seizure  (8  events).  Serious  adverse 
events  reported  in  more  than  1  patient  included  2  reports  each  of  balance  disorder,  status  epilepticus, 
pyrexia, diarrhea and rash. Review of the serious cases indicates that most of the events occurred in one 
patient. 
An additional search of the global rufinamide adverse event report database was performed for all reports 
with an event coded to the SOCs of hepatobiliary disorders and renal and urinary disorders since the IBD 
through  13  Nov  2017  in  children  younger  than  4  years  of  age.  The  search  yielded  2  post  marketing 
reports where one patient experienced an event of nephrotic syndrome and another patient experienced 
events  of  acute  hepatic  failure,  cholestasis,  hepatitis  fulminant  and  ear  infection.  These  2  reports  are 
summarized below. 
The  report  of  fulminant  hepatitis,  and  acute  liver  failure  is  a  health  authority  report  that  describes  a  2 
year old female who received Inovelon for convulsions and was also treated with co-suspect anti-epileptic 
agent,  phenobarbital  (Gardenal),  and  an  antibiotic,  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  (Augmentin).  The  patient 
received  Inovelon  100  mg  twice  daily.  Days  later  following  a  diagnosis  of  bilateral  otitis  requiring 
hospitalization and antibiotic treatment the patient experienced fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and 
hepatic  cholestasis.  All  suspect  and  concomitant  medications  were  discontinued  and  the  events  abated.  
Concomitant  medications 
included: 
levocarnitine, 
clonazepam, 
amitriptyline 
hydrochloride, 
trihexyphenidyl  hydrochloride,  and  esomeprazole  magnesium.    Medical  history  consisted  of  Crisponi 
syndrome. 
The report of nephrotic syndrome is a physician and consumer report that describes a 3 year old female 
who received rufinamide (known as Banzel in the US) for the treatment of epilepsy. The patient received 
Banzel  120  mg  daily  which  was  titrated  up  to  320  mg/daily.  The  patient  experienced  a  urinary  tract 
infection  and  was  diagnosed  with  nephrotic  syndrome  associated  with  proteinuria  (urinary  protein  4+) 
and hypoalbuminemia albumin (3.3 gm/dl), following a 4 months latency period. The event of nephrotic 
syndrome was considered medically important by the company. Banzel therapy continued. The nephrotic 
syndrome  continues  and  the  patient  is  being  treated  with  prednisone  for  the  event.  The  reporting 
physician  considered  the  event  of  nephrotic  syndrome  to  be  not  related  to  the  Banzel  therapy. 
Concomitant medications included: clobazam, levetiracetam, and vigabatrin. Medical history consisted of 
congenital brain malformation/microcephaly. 
The SADRs observed in children younger than 4 years of age are consistent with the underlying disease in 
this patient population and with the safety profile of rufinamide described in the product information for 
children  aged  ≥  4  years  of  age.  There  is  no  single  adverse  event  or  grouping  of  adverse  events  that 
appears to be occurring at a higher than expected rate for this population or that indicates a new safety 
signal.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of rufinamide use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in 
patients 4 years of age and older at doses up to 1000 mg/day has previously been evaluated based on 
data from the pivotal trial 022 and was further supported by post-marketing data and data from study 
304. The safety profile in the proposed extended target population of children aged 1 to 4 years with 
inadequately controlled LGS was evaluated in study 303. In this study, rufinamide was given at doses up 
to 45 mg/kg/day, which was compared to any other AED at the investigator’s choice. The study provided 
long-term safety data up to 2 years of exposure. However, due to the small size of the trial, only limited 
support could be derived from the data.

In study 303, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in both treatment arms: 22 of 25 subjects 
(88.0%) in the rufinamide group and 10 of 12 subjects (83.3%) in the any other AED group reported 
TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide group (occurring in ≥10% of subjects) were 
vomiting (28.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (28.0%), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), 
and sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough, and pyrexia (16.0% each) as well as bronchitis, 
constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each). In the any other 
AED group, upper respiratory tract infection (33.3%), diarrhoea, seizure, and pyrexia (25.0% each), and 
cough (16.7%) were the most common TEAEs (occurring in >1 subject). Approximately half of all 
subjects in both treatment groups (13 of 25 [52.0%] in the rufinamide group and 6 of 12 [50.0%] in the 
any other AED group) TEAEs were considered to be possibly or probably related to study drug. 
Reported TEAEs of special interest in the rufinamide group were weight loss (2 of 25 [8.0%] subjects), 
skin reactions (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), somnolence (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), and fatigue (1 of 25 
[4.0%] subjects). Reported TEAEs of special interest in the any other AED group were skin reactions and 
fatigue (1 of 12 [8.3%] subjects each). 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had TEAEs that were considered mild (4 of 25 in the 
rufinamide group and 4 of 12 in the any other AED group) or moderate (14 of 25 in the rufinamide group 
and 4 of 12 in the any-other-AED group) by the investigators. Both groups had similar overall incidences 
of severe TEAEs including 4 subjects (16.0%) in the rufinamide group (1 bronchitis and pneumonia 
aspiration, 1 encephalitis and pneumonia influenza, 1 pneumonia, and 1 weight decreased). Except for 
the case that have presented encephalitis and pneumonia influenza, the other cases were considered 
possibly related to the study drug. 
SAEs reported by more than 1 subject were bronchopneumonia (1 subject in each group), seizure (1 
subject in the rufinamide group and 3 subjects in the any other AED group), status epilepticus (2 subjects 
in the rufinamide group), and respiratory distress (2 subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 subject in the 
any other AED group). Among the SAEs, 5 patients experienced SAEs considered possibly related or 
related to study drug, including 3 subjects in the rufinamide group (pneumonia aspiration, status 
epilepticus, and bronchopneumonia) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (seizure and lethargy). 
One death occurred in the rufinamide group, but this event (pneumonia) was considered not related to 
study drug. 
No new concerns arose from laboratory values, vital signs and ECGs conducted in patients receiving 
rufinamide. 
Overall, the data from study 303 were consistent with the known safety profile of Inovelon. No new or 
unexpected risks were identified. Pneumonia and influenza were already listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
of Inovelon as common adverse reactions. Likewise, anorexia, eating disorder, weight decreased, 
decreased appetite and vomiting are known adverse reactions (common or very common) and listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC as well as in the RMP as important identified risks. The SmPC furthermore 
includes a warning in relation to status epilepticus and possible treatment discontinuation as cases of 
status epilepticus have previously been reported in the clinical development involving older children. 
Precautionary statements in the SmPC furthermore refer to CNS adverse reactions including dizziness, 
somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances, as well as hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS (Drug 
Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Status epilepticus, 
rash and hypersensitivity as well as CNS adverse reactions were also recognised as important identified 
risks in the RMP. 
Of the 19 serious adverse events (SAE)cases reported post marketing (43 serious events), 18 cases were 
considered as related to rufinamide by the reporter. No signal was raised based on these SAE. All SAE are 
known with rufinamide and mentioned in the current SmPC.Post-marketing AEs reported in patients aged 
less than 4 years were consistent with those events that have been seen when rufinamide is used in older

patients. Safety data from Study 304 in Japanese patients also did not differ from the known safety 
profile of rufinamide in LGS patients.  
The MAH provided the 2 requested Cioms forms: 
-  One case of fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure reported in a 2 year old female patient 
also treated with amoxicilline/clavulanic acid. Hepatitis is a known ADR with amoxicillin. No further 
investigation is required.  
-  One case of nephrotic syndrome is reported in a 3 year old female who presented urinary tract 
infection 4 months after rufinamide treatment initiation. This infection could induce nephrotic 
syndrome. According to the reporter, diabetes could also be suspected. Some infection are known 
ADR with rufinamide (pneumonia, ear infection, sinusitis, and rhinitis). No further investigation is 
required at this stage. Renal disorders should be followed as part of routine pharmacovigilance until 
further available data on this risk.  
Finally, in study 303, patients received the approved rufinamide oral suspension, which contains 0.3 
mg/mL propylparaben. The MAH took the opportunity of this application to address a previous 
recommendation of the CHMP to consider development of a paraben-free formulation due to concerns 
around the potential reproductive toxicity of propylparabens in the paediatric population. With reference 
to the Reflection paper on the use of methyl- and propylparaben as excipients in human medicinal 
products for oral use (EMA/CHMP/272921/2012, adopted by CHMP on 22 Oct 2015), and given that the 
daily doses of propylparaben in rufinamide oral suspension are 13% to 23% of the acceptable daily intake 
specified in the reflection paper, reformulation of the oral suspension was not considered necessary. This 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP in line with a previous PRAC recommendation 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002671/201601).  In addition, the applicant provided a scientific rational based on 
literature and published data to discuss the metabolic differences and capacity of children (especially 
children less than 4 years of age) compared to adults. Based on these data, it appears that the main 
enzyme system responsible for metabolism/hydrolysis of parabens esters are the carboxylesterases in 
humans (hCE1 and hCE2 [human carboxylesterase]). Although there is some uncertainty around the 
nature and maturity of the metabolic routes of parabens in very young children, with a large variability 
among different age groups (less than 1 year of age, children [1-10 years old], and adults, evidence 
suggests that hCEs activity is approximately 50% of adult levels of activity by the age of 3 months. These 
data provides some reassurance on the capacity of young children to hydrolyze propylparaben via hCE in 
particular with regard to the proposed maximum dose of rufinamide. The CHMP considers that the 
content of propylparaben has been satisfactorily justified and no safety concerns in the proposed age 
group are foreseen.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The results of study 303 showed that rufinamide was well tolerated in subjects aged 1 to less than 4 
years. The safety profile of the younger paediatric subjects revealed no new safety concern compared to 
the known safety profile in older children, adolescents and adults. While the number of patients exposed 
was too limited to allow detection of rare event or realistic frequency estimations, the CHMP was of the 
view that the totality of the available safety data was sufficient to support the present application. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
In order to closely monitor this newly added population of children less than 4 years of age the PSUR 
cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP. 
Based on the above considerations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 90/103 
 
  
  
list for rufinamide needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should 
follow a 1 year cycle. This new frequency will take effect after the next data lock point currently published 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. The next PSUR, which will still maintain the previous frequency, should cover the period to 
15/01/2020 and be submitted within 90 days of the data lock point in accordance with the updated EURD 
list. Taking into account the new frequency, the data lock point for the following PSUR will be 
15/01/2021. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMP: 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 10.1 (dated 20 March 2018) is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the RMP version with the following contents.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of the new indication related to include the treatment of seizures associated with 
Lennox Gastaut syndrome in patients 1 year of age and older as adjunctive therapy, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.5, 5.1, 5.2 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Belgium and Luxemburg. 
The changes pertaining to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2 are indicated below (new text in bold, 
deleted text double strikethrough). The remaining SmPC changes are highlighted in the attached Product 
Information (PI) document. 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Inovelon is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome in patients4 1 years of age and older.

Posology and method of administration 
[…] 
Posology 
Use in children from one year to less than four years of age 
Patients not receiving valproate: 
Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided 
doses separated by approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the 
dose may be increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day every third day to a target dose of 
45 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 
12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum recommended dose is 45 mg/kg/day. 
Patients receiving valproate: 
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of 
Inovelon is recommended for patients being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be 
initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated by 
approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be 
increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day every third day to a target dose of 30 mg/kg/day 
administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. For this 
patient population, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg/kg/day. 
If the recommended calculated dose of Inovelon is not achievable, the dose should be given to 
the nearest whole 100 mg tablet. 
Use in children four years of age or older and less than 30 kg 
Patients <30 kg not receiving valproate: 
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, 
the dose may be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every two third days, up to a 
maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg/day. 
Doses of up to 3600 mg/day have been studied in a limited number of patients.

Patients <30 kg also receiving valproate: 
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is 
recommended for patients <30 kg being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a 
daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, after a minimum of 2 days the dose 
may be increased by 200 mg/day, to the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day. 
Use in adults, adolescents and children four years of age or older of 30 kg or over 
Patients >30 kg not receiving valproate: 
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, 
the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments, as frequently as every two other days, up to a 
maximum recommended dose as indicated in the table below.

Discontinuation of treatment rufinamide 
When rufinamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually. In clinical trials 
rufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two days 
(see section 4.4). 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of rufinamide in children new-born infants or infants and toddlers aged 4 
years and less has than 1 year have not yet been established. Currently No data are available data are 
described in(see section 4.8 and 5.21 but no recommendation on a posology can be made).

Method of administration 
Rufinamide is for oral use. ItThe tablet should be taken twice daily with water in the morning and in the 
evening, in two equally divided doses. As a food effect was observed, Inovelon should be administered 
with food (see section 5.2). If the patient has difficulty with swallowing, tablets can be crushed and 
administered in half a glass of water. Alternatively, use the score line to break the tablet into two 
equal halves.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
For patients on Inovelon treatment who have administration of valproate initiated, significant increases in 
rufinamide plasma concentrations may occur. The most pronounced increases were observed in patients 
of low body weight (<30 kg).Therefore, consideration should be given to a dose reduction of Inovelon in 
patients who <30kg are initiated on valproate therapy (see section 4.2).

2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, Pp=0.5939). However, due to the limitations of the available data the study 
was inconclusive in respect of efficacy.

Pharmacokinetic properties 
[…] 
Children (1-12 years) 
Children generally have lower clearance of rufinamide than adults, and this difference is related to body 
size with rufinamide clearance increasing with body weight.  
A recent population PK analysis of rufinamide on data pooled from 139 subjects (115 LGS 
patients and 24 healthy subjects), including 83 paediatric LGS patients (10 patients aged 
1 to < 2 years, 14 patients aged 2 to < 4 years, 14 patients aged 4 to < 8 years, 21 patients 
aged 8 to < 12 years and 24 patients aged 12 to < 18 years) indicated that when rufinamide is 
dosed on a mg/kg/day basis in LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, comparable exposure to that 
in LGS patients aged ≥ 4 years, in which efficacy has been demostrated, is achieved.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
User  consultation  of  Inovelon  PL  had  been  submitted  for  the  initial  Market  Authorisation  Application 
(treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in paediatric patients 4 year of age and 
older). A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
Rufinamide is authorized for the adjunctive treatment of LGS seizures in patients 4 years of age or older 
based on the results of study 022, which was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel trial comparing the safety and efficacy of rufinamide as add-on therapy relative to 
placebo in subjects aged 4 to 30 years with inadequately controlled LGS.  
Given that LGS disease expression is similar in younger and older children, there was no reason to expect 
that the effect of rufinamide on children with LGS between the ages of 1 and 4 would differ from that 
already demonstrated in older children and adults, although it was noted that the diagnosis of LGS can be 
challenging in the very young children.  
With the present application, results from study 303, a 2-year multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-
label study for evaluation of the safety, PK and efficacy of rufinamide as add-on treatment for control of 
seizures associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age compared to any other approved 
add-on AED of the investigator’s choice. 
The efficacy of Inovelon in the adjunctive seizure therapy of LGS patients 4 years of age or older had 
already been demonstrated in study 022. Rufinamide was administered orally as 100, 200, or 400 mg 
tablets twice daily. Dosing started at approximately 10 mg/kg/day, and was titrated to approximately 45 
mg/kg/day over a 1- to 2-week period. Superiority of rufinamide over placebo in all primary efficacy 
variables was demonstrated as percentage change in total seizure frequency; percentage change in tonic-
atonic seizure frequency; and the seizure severity rating. Subjects in the rufinamide-treatment group 
experienced a 32.7% median reduction in the total seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline 
compared to an 11.7% median reduction for the placebo-treatment group (P=0.0015). An improvement 
in seizure severity was observed in 53.4% of rufinamide-treated subjects versus 30.6% of placebo-
treated subjects (P=0.0041). The median percentage change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 
days was significantly higher for rufinamide-treated subjects (42.5) than for placebo-treated subjects 
(1.4) (P<0.0001). 
The primary efficacy variables in study 303 aiming at investigating cognitive and behavioural effects of 
rufinamide were the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problems score and change from baseline in 
CBCL Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) treatment period. LS mean of the CBCL 
Assessment report  
EMA/491276/2018 
Page 96/103 
 
  
  
 
Total Problems score for subjects after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 
56.35 for the rufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928), and the 
difference between treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, p=0.5939). 
Given that LGS disease expression is similar in younger and older children, there was no reason to expect 
that the effect of rufinamide on children with LGS between the ages of 1 and 4 would differ from that 
already demonstrated in older children and adults, although it was noted that the diagnosis of LGS can be 
challenging in the very young children. The efficacy of Inovelon in the adjunctive seizure therapy of LGS 
patients 4 years of age or older had already been demonstrated in study 022. 
During the procedure the MAH has provided an updated population PK model which describes the 
rufinamide PK data well. The goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks all indicate an adequate 
model fit to data. Furthermore, the model parameters are in line with previously reported PK parameters 
for rufinamide. The model is deemed adequate for exposure predictions for all body weights (and 
subsequently all ages) and hence the exposure predictions can be used in the evaluation of exposure 
similarity between age groups and to support the proposed posology for Inovelon in LGS patients 1 to <4 
years. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For the study 303, the originally planned study size of 75 patients was reduced to a total of 37 patients 
(25 treated with rufinamide) due to difficulties in the recruitment related to the rarity of the condition, 
and the diagnostic process specifically in the younger age group. 
In addition, the anticipated minimum difference in CBCL Total Problem Score of at least -17 in favour of 
rufinamide at the study planning stage was overestimated and clearly out of reach. A difference of +2.6 
was in fact observed for the primary clinical endpoint. 
The small number of study subjects randomised (and even smaller number of subjects completing the 2-
year treatment period of 15/24 subjects in the rufinamide group and 4/12 subjects in the any-other-other 
AED group) made it difficult to interpret the study results, in particular with regards to efficacy, and the 
efficacy results of study 303 were therefore largely inconclusive. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
Study 303 provided up to 2 years of exposure data and the safety evaluation revealed no new safety 
concern in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years with seizures associated with LGS compared to the 
established safety profile in older patients. In patients aged over 4 years, the most commonly reported 
adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse 
reactions observed at a higher incidence than placebo in previous studied in LGS patients were 
somnolence and vomiting. 
In study 303, the most frequently reported TEAEs in patients exposed to rufinamide were vomiting 
(28.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (28.0%), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), and 
sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough, and pyrexia (16.0% each) as well as bronchitis, constipation, 
nasal congestion, rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each). Similar to previous studies in 
patients aged 4 years and older, the majority of TEAEs in study 303 were mild to moderate in severity. 
Rufinamide was generally well tolerated. There were no new pertinent data concerning dermatological 
events and hypersensitivity or status epilepticus. Other important identified risks in the RMP also 
remained unchanged, including decreased appetite and weight loss, coordination abnormal (ataxia), 
Assessment report

somnolence, dizziness / vertigo, diplopia and blurred vision, and vomiting. Overall, adverse reactions 
observed in study 303 were already adequately covered by the current safety information in the product 
information and the RMP. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
While the safety profile of rufinamide observed in study 303 was consistent with the previously 
established profile in older patients, the study size was very small, which is explained by the rarity of the 
disease. The number of patients exposed was thus too limited to allow detection of rare event or realistic 
frequency estimations.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While the efficacy results of study 303 were difficult to interpret and largely inconclusive, mainly due to 
the small study size, the CHMP noted that LGS disease expression was similar in younger patients 
compared to older ones and thus, there was no reason to expect that the effect of rufinamide in children 
between the ages of 1 and 4 years would differ from that already demonstrated in older children and 
adults. As a consequence, efficacy as established in the adjuvant therapy of seizures in patients ≥ 4 years 
affected by LGS could in principle be extrapolated to patients aged <4 years, provided the dose was 
established. A population modelling approach was used to characterize the PK profile of rufinamide in 
subjects with inadequately controlled LGS and to compare exposure in the paediatric population aged 1 to

less than 4 years to older patients. Nevertheless, at the time of initial application 
(EMEA/H/C/000660/II/0037), the proposed models were not considered suitable to generate reliable 
exposure predictions, which would have been needed to derive sound dose recommendation in the new 
proposed age group. The CHMP recommended for the MAH to advance the knowledge of PK properties of 
the product and re-develop a qualified/validated population PK model with an adequate predictive power 
to describe the PK of rufinamide in children. In response, an update of the population-PK modelling 
including paediatric data (1-4 years) and other data collected in older children, adolescent and adults with 
LGS was provided (CPMS-E2080-004R-v1). The updated population PK model describes the rufinamide PK 
data well. The goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks all indicate an adequate model fit to 
data. Furthermore, the model parameters are in line with previously reported PK parameters for 
rufinamide. The model is deemed adequate for exposure predictions for all body weights (and 
subsequently all ages) and hence the exposure predictions can be used in the evaluation of exposure 
similarity between age groups and to support the proposed posology for Inovelon in LGS patients 1 to <4 
years. 
In terms of safety, rufinamide was well tolerated in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age. The findings of 
the safety evaluation in study 303 were consistent with the known safety profile of rufinamide established 
in LGS patients aged 4 years and older. No new or unexpected risks were identified. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
As concluded by the CHMP at the time of the first submission, efficacy results of study 303 were largely 
inconclusive and did not support a clinically relevant effect of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years. This was mainly due to 
the small study size and the fact that the study was not adequately powered for the performed efficacy 
analyses. Nevertheless, it is agreed that the expression of LGS is similar in the younger population 
compared to older patients, and that there was no reason to expect that the effect of rufinamide on 
children between the ages of 1 and 4 years would differ from that in older children and adults, although it 
was noted that the diagnosis of LGS can be challenging in the very young children. Thus, the result of 
efficacy trial performed in children > 4 years affected by LGS could be extrapolated in population <4 
years old provided the dose is established. 
A pooled PK model has been provided (CPMS-E2080-004R-v1) which is describes the rufinamide PK data 
well. The model is deemed adequate for exposure predictions for all body weights (and subsequently all 
ages) and hence the exposure predictions can be used in the evaluation of exposure similarity between 
age groups and to support the proposed posology for Inovelon in LGS patients 1 to <4 years. The results 
from study 303 after 2 years of exposure, demonstrated that rufinamide was well tolerated in subjects 1 
to less than 4 years of age. The safety profile of the younger paediatric subjects revealed no new safety 
signals. No new or unexpected risks were identified compared to older paediatric patients. 
The benefit-risk balance of Inovelon for the applied extension of indication in patients from 1 years of age 
to 4 years with LGS is currently considered positive. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Inovelon is positive.

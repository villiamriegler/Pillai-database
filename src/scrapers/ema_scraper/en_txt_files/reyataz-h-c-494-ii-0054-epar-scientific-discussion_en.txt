Antiviral activity in vitro 
The susceptibility of atazanavir was examined against single clinical isolates from subtypes A to G of 
the HIV-1 M group, as well as one primary strain from group O. The anti HIV activities of atazanavir 
were  performed  using  PBMC  cells  infected  with  these  clinical  isolates.  Atazanavir  exhibited  potent 
inhibitory activity against all 8 primary isolates tested, with EC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 6.9 nM. 
The anti-HIV activities of atazanavir were also measured against 4 isolates of HIV-2, with EC50 values 
ranging from 1.9 to 3.2 nM.  
A further analysis of clinical isolates was performed using recombinant viruses generated from virus 
from individuals involved in atazanavir clinical studies AI424007, AI424008 and AI424034. Subtype 
B  was  the  most  prevalent  subtype,  representing  174  (74%)  of  the  isolates  evaluated.  The  range  of 
atazanavir  susceptibilities  for  subtype  B  isolates  was  0.3  to  6.5.  The  non-B  subtypes  had 
susceptibilities ranging from 0.4 to 1.8, well within the range of protease susceptibilities observed for 
subtype B isolates (Table 1). These results indicate that atazanavir susceptibility is retained not only 
among B subtype viruses, but also viruses of the other subtypes.

In vitro resistance  
In vitro selection of resistance from WT HIV-1 virus 
Three  HIV-1  strains  (RF,  LAI,  NL4-3)  were  passaged  in  MT-2  cells  in  the  presence  of  increasing 
concentrations of atazanavir. Breakthrough virus was first observed by viral-induced cytopathic effect 
that  was  subsequently  confirmed  by  drug  susceptibility  analysis.  Table  2.1  provides  more  detailed 
information concerning the in vitro selection of resistance from WT HIV-1 virus.

Following 1 month of passage in drug concentrations up to 25 nM, the RF strain of HIV-1 showed a  
4-fold  decrease  in  susceptibility  to  atazanavir  (Table  2.1).  This  virus  contained  a  single  N88S 
substitution  in  the  protease  gene.  Additional  substitutions  accumulated  with  time  and  increased 
atazanavir concentrations as shown. LAI and NL4-3 viruses with reduced susceptibility to atazanavir 
took  longer  to  break  through,  but  viral  variants  did  appear  with  prolonged  drug  selection.  The  LAI 
viruses  that  emerged  at  2.6  and  4.7  months  displayed  36-  and  93-fold  decreases  in  susceptibility  to 
atazanavir, respectively. The NL4-3 viruses selected at 3.9 and 6 months post initiation of treatment 
displayed 4.6- and 96-fold reductions in susceptibility to atazanavir, respectively (Table 2.1). 
In vitro cross resistance of clinical isolates resistant to other drugs  
A  panel  of  950  HIV-1  recombinant  clinical  isolates  were  profiled  for  their  susceptibility  to 
amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir and atazanavir. The in vitro cross-resistance to 
clinical isolates resistant to other compounds of same drug class is summarised in Table 2.2.

DE NOVO MUTATIONS IN PATIENTS FAILING ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR 
De novo mutations in treatment experienced patients failing atazanavir/ritonavir 
De  novo  mutations  in  treatment-experienced  patients  failing  therapy  are  presented  in  Table  3.1  by 
frequency  (i.e.  >  20  %  or  10%  to  20%)  followed  by  a  short  description  of  correlation  observed 
between specific mutations and change in phenotypic sensitivity.

Viral resistance profiles were consistent with prior resistance assessments of antiretroviral-experienced 
atazanavir-treated patients who subsequently had virologic failure. Baseline phenotypic resistance to 
atazanavir,  ritonavir  and  lopinavir  were  low  in  both  treatment  regimens.  Few  on-study  substitutions 
occurred in  viral strains from  these  subjects  with  virologic  failure.  De  novo  mutations  emerged  at a 
frequency of > 20% in a minority of virologic failure subjects. Five substitutions emerged de novo in 
> 20% of subjects and none of these substitutions are specific to atazanavir. A greater number of de 
novo substitutions were present in 10% to 20% of subjects. Similar to the more frequently observed 
substitutions,  none  are  specific  to  atazanavir.  These  new  substitutions  may  reflect  re-emergence  of 
archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study AI424045 treatment-experienced population. 
De novo mutations in treatment naïve patients failing atazanavir/ritonavir 
In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naïve patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L 
substitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution 
for  atazanavir.  Resistance  levels  to  atazanavir  ranged  from  3.5-  to  29-fold  without  evidence  of 
phenotypic  cross  resistance  to  other  PIs.  In  clinical  trials  of  antiretroviral  treatment  naive  patients 
treated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI 
substitutions.  The  N88S  substitution  has  been  rarely  observed  in  patients  with  virologic  failure  on 
atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir 
when it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead 
to phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ziextenzo is intended to be used for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic 
myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
The applicant claims the authorisation for Ziextenzo (also referred to as LA-EP2006 in this report) as a similar 
product to Neulasta (EU) which was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 22 of August 2002. The 
proposed indication for Ziextenzo is the same as for the reference product Neulasta (EU). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its subsequent infectious complications represent the most common 
dose-limiting toxicity of cancer therapy. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of treatment-naïve 
patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient population; the dosage, timing and 
type of chemotherapy used1. The severity of febrile neutropenia depends on the dose intensity of the 
chemotherapy regimen, the patient’s prior history of either radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and 
comorbidities.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The principal regulator of physiological granulopoiesis human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that has been shown to 
regulate the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, mediated via a single affinity 
extracellular receptor. By binding and signalling through granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor 
(G-CSFR), G-CSF has multiple effects on circulating neutrophils and on neutrophil precursors in bone marrow2.  
Stimulation of precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow leads to an increase in the total mass of 
G-CSFR-expressing cells, which serves as a negative regulator of G-CSF levels through accelerated clearance of 
G-CSF 3 . 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a significant dose-limiting toxicity in cancer treatment and a major risk 
factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of 
treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient population; the 
dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used1. The occurrence of febrile neutropenia often necessitates 
chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen hospital stay; increase monitoring, diagnostic, 
and treatment costs; and reduce patient quality of life.

2.1.5.  Management 
Primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors, CSFs, reduces the frequency of chemotherapy induced4 
neutropenia, all-cause mortality during chemotherapy, and need for hospital care e.g. in breast cancer. The 
administration of G-CSF can accelerate the development of neutrophils from committed progenitors, thereby 
reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of neutropenia5 . Forms of G-CSF such as filgrastim and 
lenograstim including biosimilars, are administered by a course of daily injections, whereas pegfilgrastim allows 
once-per-cycle administration and may avoid suboptimal daily dosing.   
EORTC 2010 guidelines cover use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF, to reduce the incidence of 
chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adult patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and solid 
tumours. Prophylaxis with a CSF is recommended for: 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with >20% risk of FN 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with 10% to 20% risk of FN, subject to patient specific risk factors 
such as elderly age (≥65 years) and neutrophil count 
• 
Patients with a previous episode of FN  
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduced duration of the neutropenic 
phase in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim was initially approved for the prevention of 
infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The pivotal study in patients with small cell lung carcinoma receiving 
cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of Grade 4 neutropenia, as well as statistically significant 
reductions in the incidence of hospitalizations and IV antibiotic usage6. Subsequent indications for filgrastim 
included engraftment following bone marrow transplantation, mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells 
and engraftment following transplantation, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid 
leukemia, and severe chronic neutropenia. Because of its relatively short half-life of 3.5 hours, filgrastim is 
administered once daily by SC administration no less than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continuing until 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within each cycle of treatment. Shortcomings of filgrastim include the 
requirement for either daily visits to the clinic or home injections by the patient during the period of 
administration, frequent ANC monitoring, the possibility of missed doses, and suboptimal duration of treatment 
(either too short or too long). Efforts to overcome these limitations led to the PEGylation of the G-CSF protein. 
The subsequent PEGylation of the G-CSF protein filgrastim altered the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, resulting in 
slower clearance and a prolonged half-life (between 15 and 80 hours), thus permitting a single injection per 
cycle of chemotherapy7. Pegylation of filgrastim increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for 
renal clearance. Due to its high molecular weight, pegfilgrastim exhibits limited transport into the blood 
capillaries after SC administration and enters the systemic circulation via an indirect route, through the 
lymphatics.

With a long half-life and target-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until the bone 
marrow neutrophil precursors start to come back after chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) was first 
authorized for marketing in the EU and US in 2002. 
About the product 
The active substance is a recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) covalently linked 
to a single 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG). The applicant intends to claim the same therapeutic indications as 
granted for Neulasta in the European Union (EU). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this application is Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Section 4, Part II, Annex I of said

GMP 
The GMP compliance status of the manufacturing sites has been confirmed.  
GLP 
Except for one exploratory (LA-EP-06-001) and one dose range finding study (LA-EP-06-009) which were 
conducted according to local laws, all other LA-EP2006 nonclinical studies were conducted in accordance with 
the international GLP principles. 
However, the study parts on dose formulation analytics and toxicokinetics were not performed under GLP and 
are therefore excluded from the statement of compliance (this applies to the following toxicity studies: 
LA-EP2006-003, LA-EP2006-005, LA-EP2006-006 and LA-EP-06-011). 
GCP 
All studies were designed and conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of 
Helsinki. A GCP inspection was conducted by EMA for the clinical study LA-EP06-103. The inspected sites were 
the clinical facility BE/BA at PRA Health Sciences (Netherlands), the Analytical and Clinical Laboratory BE/BA at 
Nuvisan GmbH (Germany) and the Sponsor Hexal AG (TMF located in Germany). The overall GCP-compliance 
was judged acceptable. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ziextenzo is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(r-met-HuG-CSF, filgrastim) covalently linked to a 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG). The filgrastim protein part 
of the molecule is produced by recombinant-DNA technology in E. coli. Through conjugation of PEG to filgrastim, 
renal clearance is decreased translating to an increased half-life. The company code for this product is 
LA-EP2006. 
Ziextenzo has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Neulasta (Amgen Europe B.V.). 
The finished product is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection containing 6 mg8/0.6 ml of 
pegfilgrastim as active substance. Other ingredients are: sodium acetate, sorbitol (E420), polysorbate 20, and 
water for injections. 
The product is supplied in a pre-filled syringe (Type I glass), with a plunger stopper, a plunger rod, a stainless 
steel needle and a needle cap with an automatic needle guard (device part). Each pre-filled syringe contains 0.6 
mL of solution for injection. The pack size comprises one pre-filled syringe in blistered packaging.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
LA-EP2006 (INN: pegfilgrastim) has been developed and is manufactured by Sandoz. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent 
conjugate of recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (r-met-HuG-CSF, filgrastim) with a 
single 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG).  
Filgrastim is an E. coli-derived rhG-CSF with an additional N-terminal methionine and compared to the native 
human form with the lack of an O-glycosylation at Thr133. It consists of 175 amino acids, with the N-terminus 
covalently linked to a single 20 kDa PEG (overall relative molecular mass of approx. 40 kDa). It contains five 
Cys-residues, with two intra-molecular disulphide bonds, as shown in the Figure 1 below. 
Figure 1: Filgrastim structure 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The LA-EP2006 active substance (pegylated filgrastim) is manufactured by pegylation of filgrastim 
intermediate, tested and released by Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. (a Sandoz company), Kolodvorska 27, SI-1234 
Menges, Slovenia. Additionally, contract partners are involved in quality control testing of the intermediate and 
active substance bulk solution. Copies of valid GMP certificates and Manufacturing Authorisations are included in 
the dossier.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Filgrastim is produced in transformed E.coli bacteria, and purified using established biotechnology procedures. 
After fermentation and harvesting the target protein is isolated and purified in a sequence of downstream 
processing steps including several dilution, filtration and chromatography steps. During this process, a single 20 
kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to a target protein in a pegylation reaction. A pegylated and purified 
product solution is concentrated to the desired bulk concentration and diafiltered into the final formulation 
buffer. The final drug substance solution is filtered, filled into the storage containers and stored.  
The proposed container is suitable, with components complying with Ph.Eur.  
Control of materials 
Raw materials are controlled by appropriate specifications and obtained from established suppliers. Upon 
receipt, these products are tested according to pharmacopoeia monographs or internal test procedures. With 
regard to the PEG material attributes, their effects on LA-EP2006 active substance quality and process 
performance were assessed within a raw material risk assessment. As requested in a Major Objection PEG has 
been re-classified as an intermediate (and not as a starting material). Accordingly, an updated QP declaration 
has been provided which is considered sufficient to confirm GMP compliant production of PEG. Within the 
response to the Major Objection detailed information on the manufacture and control of PEG has been 
submitted. Thus, the Major Objection is resolved.  
No human or animal derived raw materials are used in the manufacturing process of the active substance and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials used in the establishment of cell substrate.  
A two-tiered cell bank system has been established. The working cell bank (WCB) is prepared from a master cell 
bank (MCB). The MCB and WCB were subjected to extensive testing and characterisation to verify identity, 
purity and stability of the cell substrate. Plasmid integrity was investigated for end of production cells at the end 
of five production scale fermentation runs in the main fermentation step. In addition, genetic stability of the 
strain up to the post production stage was demonstrated. The applicant has therefore provided sufficient 
information regarding the generation, characterisation and testing of the MCB and WCB. A protocol for 
preparation of future WCBs has been included in the dossier. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process controls performed during manufacture of LA-EP2006 active substance have been categorised in two 
main groups: operational parameters = input (process) parameters and performance parameters = output 
parameters (in-process controls). Process parameters as well as in-process controls are further divided into 
critical, key and non-key parameters. Operating ranges and acceptance ranges are defined for process 
parameters, acceptance, action and alert limits are established for in-process controls. 
Classification of the process parameters was performed taking into account the existing product and process 
knowledge and experimental data. All adaptations of ranges for process parameters (PP) and in-process controls 
(IPC) are subject to internal change control management according to cGMP guidelines. Operational ranges 
(OR), acceptable ranges (AR), acceptance criteria (AC), action limits (AL) and alert limits (ALL) are defined. The 
critical PP and IPC for each manufacturing step are defined and do include appropriate control of 
sterility/bioburden and endotoxin. If acceptance criteria are not met, the batch will be rejected.  
Specifications for the PEG and filgrastim intermediates include appropriate tests for appearance, identity, purity, 
content, potency, determination of pH, microbiological attributes, selected process related substances, HCP and 
host cell DNA.

Process validation 
The upstream (fermentation and isolation) process and all steps of the downstream purification process were 
validated. The critical process parameters and in-process controls were considered. Data have been obtained for 
each step investigated and confirmed that all parameters and in-process controls met their pre-defined 
specifications. Clearance of cell substrate impurities has been successfully demonstrated. Microbial control is 
shown to be effective. Removal and control of process related impurities and product related variants was 
successfully shown. The performance of chromatography resins used in the purification processes was 
evaluated.  
Satisfactory transport simulation runs have been conducted and real time transport data are provided.  
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development, which includes site transfers and scale ups, has been adequately 
described. The applicant has performed a comprehensive process characterisation exercise as part of process 
development, encompassing fermentation, isolation and purification of the filgrastim intermediate and 
LA-EP2006 active substance purification. The outcome of these studies has led to greater process knowledge 
and improved process control. An overview of the studies and a detailed description of the process 
characterisation methodology is provided in the dossier. 
Characterisation 
The active substance was thoroughly characterised on the physicochemical level and at the level of biological 
activity using an array of analytical procedures to investigate all the relevant attributes of the molecule both 
regarding identity and purity. These included orthogonal separation methods probing hydrophobicity, charge 
and size, measurements of the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, and assessments of 
biological properties of the active substance.  
Potential process related impurities from the unpegylated intermediate can be identified using established 
methods. These include host cell DNA and proteins, endotoxin and solvents. They are removed during the 
purification process or are well controlled at the level of the intermediate. Potential process related impurities 
from the pegylation step are removed during the purification process or well controlled at the level of the active 
substance.  
Product-related substances and impurities have also been thoroughly characterised. 
Presented data showed there is no safety concern regarding potential leachables/extractables from plastic 
materials used during the manufacture or from the primary packaging. 
 Specification 
The release specifications for the active substance release include appropriate tests for appearance, identity, 
purity, content, potency, acetate content, determination of pH, microbiological attributes and selected process 
related substances. HCP and host cell DNA are controlled at the filgrastim intermediate stage. 
The biological potency of the active substance is determined by measuring its ability to stimulate proliferation of 
NFS-60 cells compared to the LA-EP2006 in-house reference material.  
Analytical methods 
Validation of non-compendial methods is adequately described.  
Batch analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 17/127 
  
  
Batch analysis data of pilot and commercial lots have been provided. Two of these batches were used in clinical 
efficacy and safety studies. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
Two types of reference materials are used for manufacturing and testing of LA-EP2006. The filgrastim reference 
materials are used as reference for testing of unpegylated filgrastim samples. The LA-EP2006 reference material 
was established as a reference for testing of N-terminal monopegylated filgrastim.  
The bioactivity unitage of the in-house reference material complies with the second WHO international standard 
NIBSC 09/136. 
During the development of LA-EP2006, three reference materials were established. The in-house reference 
materials were prepared from representative LA-EP2006 active substance lots, as described in ICH Q6B.  
As part of this reference system, the in-house primary reference material will be compared to available 
international standard for pegfilgrastim. 
Stability 
Stability data has been presented for several active substance batches which were produced at commercial scale 
according to the fully developed manufacturing process at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. Studies 
were conducted according to ICH Q5C and ICH Q1A(R2). Samples were stored in representative containers at 
intended, accelerated and stress conditions. In addition, freeze / thaw studies were conducted applying up to 
three cycles of freezing and thawing. A photostability study with forced degradation and confirmatory conditions 
was also performed.  
Based on the presented results a shelf life at -20 ± 5°C for up to 36 months is justified for the active substance. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Supporting comparability studies were performed to link materials from different stages of the development 
program to the final manufacturing process. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is a clear and colourless solution for subcutaneous injection containing 6 mg/0.6 mL 
pegfilgrastim as active substance. The solution is provided in 1.0 ml pre-filled glass syringes (colourless Type I 
glass) with fixed needle and rigid needle shield closed with a rubber stopper. A low overfill of the nominal volume 
is justified by the dead volume of the syringe and the capability of the filling process. All container closure 
components are made of well-established materials for the packaging of medicinal products and are in line with 
USP and Ph. Eur. The finished product is presented as ready-for-use product for single use application 
assembled with the following functional secondary packaging components: a plunger rod and a needle safety 
device (BD UltraSafe Passive X100L) as a safety mechanism to reduce occurrence of accidental needle sticks. 
The passive needle shield system constitutes a medical device and a declaration of conformity with the relevant 
essential requirements of Annex I of the Council Directive 93/42/EEC as amended has been provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 18/127 
  
  
The composition of the finished product is identical to that of the reference product Neulasta except for the 
polysorbate 20 content which is slightly lower. The LA-EP2006 DP is formulated with the following excipients: 
acetic acid as buffer, sorbitol as tonifying agent, polysorbate 20 as surfactant and water for injection as diluent. 
LA-EP2006 drug product is pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide (if necessary). The well-known excipients are 
standard excipients for biopharmaceuticals for subcutaneous administration; they comply with the respective 
Ph. Eur. monographs and the compendial requirements for parenteral use. No excipients of human or animal 
origin are used.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was established to guide development. Target ranges for relevant 
quality attributes (QA) were derived by testing multiple batches of EU-approved Neulasta and US-licensed 
Neulasta. A comprehensive set of quality attributes of LA-EP2006 was systematically evaluated for their 
criticality, i.e. their impact on efficacy, PK/PD, immunogenicity, and safety, using a risk ranking approach as 
outlined in ICH Q9.  
Formulation development 
Formulation studies including stress studies (mechanical stress, temperature stress) were carried out using 
different buffer systems and pH values, tonifiers, and surfactants at different concentrations and based on the 
analytical results (SEC, RP-HPLC, content) the formulation was defined. The selected formulation was used 
throughout clinical development. No overage is required for commercial manufacturing.  
Process development 
Standard materials for the primary packaging of medicinal products which are in line with pharmacopoeial 
requirements have been selected for primary packaging of the finished product. Integrity of the container 
closure system and compatibility with LA-EP2006 was adequately demonstrated. Assessment of potential 
leachables and extractables for the primary packaging and for process materials coming into contact with the 
finished product is regarded sufficient. Development data demonstrating reliable functionality of the pre-filled 
syringe (i.e. break-loose/gliding force) over the entire shelf life have been provided. 
For the integral device, i.e. the needle safety device (NSD) which consists of a needle guard assembly and 
plunger rod, comprehensive technical and scientific information has been provided. Detailed information on 
design and safety features, shelf-life, transport validation, the assembly and packaging process of the final 
assembled product including IPC and release tests, process validations, functional testing, technical drawings, 
and a check for compliance with the essential requirements/ essential principles as outlined in Annex I of 
Directive 93/42/EEC and GHTF/SG1/N68:2012 is presented in the dossier.  
The manufacturing process development, which includes site transfers and scale ups, has been adequately 
described. The implemented changes are adequately justified and are deemed unlikely to impact the quality of 
the final product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured, tested, assembled with the device parts, and packaged at two intended 
commercial manufacturing sites. Sandoz GmbH Schaftenau, Austria is responsible for batch release. Several 
(contract) laboratories are involved in quality control testing. Valid GMP certificates/manufacturing 
authorisations are available.  
The finished product is produced using standard manufacturing steps. The resulting compounded finished 
product solution is sterile filtered and aseptically filled into syringes. The stoppered filled syringes are 100% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 19/127 
  
  
visually inspected, labelled and stored at 2-8°C. The labelled pre-filled syringes are assembled with a needle 
safety device/plunger rod, labelled, and packaged. The assembled product is stored at 2 - 8°C.  
The effective batch size is defined by the amount of active substance used and by the pegfilgrastim content in 
the active substance batch. Active substance batches (up to a defined number) may be pooled to manufacture 
one batch of finished product. The batch formula is presented in the dossier.  
Based on the physicochemical and microbiological hold times determined during small-scale studies and process 
validation, the storage and processing times were adequately defined. Process parameters and in-process 
controls with adequate limits have been satisfactorily established for the critical process steps which ensure 
consistent process performance and quality of the product. The process design as well as the process and control 
limits are sufficiently justified and supported by process development studies, validation data and product 
knowledge.  
A traditional process validation approach was applied. For the validation runs all process parameters were 
executed within the operating ranges and all analytical data of IPC testing complied with the acceptance ranges 
valid at time of testing. All validation batches complied with the release specifications valid at time of testing and 
the proposed commercial release specification. The presented analytical data from batch release, IPC testing, 
and additional sampling demonstrate that the manufacturing process is reliable and delivers product of 
consistent quality. Aseptic manufacturing is regularly confirmed by media fills.  
The assembly, labelling, and packaging process was validated at both commercial sites by consecutive 
processing of three batches of pre-filled syringes under routine conditions.  
Adequacy of the established shipment conditions was verified by transport validation studies. 
Product specification 
The proposed release and shelf life specifications for the finished product include test methods for identity, 
purity/impurities including microbiological attributes, content, potency, and general attributes. The 
specifications are overall in line with ICH Q6B and Ph.Eur. 0520 (parenteral preparations). The panel of 
analytical methods appears appropriate to ensure that only product of adequate quality will be released to the 
market.  
Identity is verified by two orthogonal methods, variants and impurities are adequately controlled by three 
orthogonal chromatographic methods and microbiological tests. General attributes include coloration, clarity, 
pH, extractable volume, appearance of container, and osmolality. Tests for process related impurities HCP and 
residual DNA are carried out at the filgrastim intermediate stage and hence testing at finished product release is 
not required. Taking into account that the concentration of polysorbate 20 is controlled by an IPC, and the 
consistent data from process validation, omission of a release test for the stabiliser polysorbate 20 is acceptable. 
The concentrations of acetate and sorbitol are indirectly monitored by pH and osmolality.  
In addition to the panel of analytical methods for release testing, the shelf-life specification comprises a 
container closure integrity test (CCIT) by dye ingress. For several attributes wider specification limits have been 
set in the shelf-life specification and osmolality is not tested. The proposed release and shelf-life specification 
limits are deemed acceptable. 
The specifications and their limits are based on compendial requirements, batch release and stability data for 
LA-EP2006, and results for the reference product and are agreeable.  
Analytical methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 20/127 
  
  
Most of the test methods are identical to those used for control of the active substance. The analytical methods 
specific for finished product testing are sufficiently described. If applicable, references to compendial 
monographs are given. Validation of the CCIT has been carried out in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1). Suitability 
of the bioburden test and the sterility test has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of several batches manufactured throughout the development of LA-EP2006 including large 
scale batches which have been manufactured according to the intended commercial process and at both 
commercial manufacturing sites are presented. These batches have been produced for (pre)clinical studies, tech 
transfer, stability studies, and for process validation purposes. All batches manufactured at the intended 
commercial sites comply with the specifications valid at time of testing and the proposed commercial finished 
product specifications (in some instances results are not available as the corresponding parameter was not part 
of the specification at time of release). The batch analysis data demonstrate that the manufacturing process 
reliably delivers a consistent and uniform product.  
Reference materials 
Reference materials are described in the active substance section. 
Container closure system 
Well-established materials of compendial quality are used as primary packaging materials. The primary 
container closure system consists of a sterile, non-pyrogenic, syringe barrel made of transparent, type I glass 
with an attached 27 Gx 1/2 “ stainless steel needle, a needle shield, and a rubber stopper. A polypropylene rigid 
needle shield covers the needle shield without direct product contact. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from several finished product batches in pre-filled syringes including clinical and validation batches 
have been provided. These include validation batches manufactured according to the commercial process at 
commercial scale. Supportive stability data for the batches used for the initial, failed PK/PD study LA-EP06-101 
are presented as well. No stability data are provided for the assembled final product with the needle safety 
device. However, considering that the device parts have no direct contact with the finished product/sterile fluid 
path it is considered acceptable to determine the shelf-life of the assembled combination product based on the 
stability data for finished product in PFS.  
The stability studies encompassed storage of finished product for 36 months at the intended long term 
conditions (5 ± 3°C) including out-of-fridge (OOF) stability studies with pre-filled syringes that were kept for one 
or two weeks at accelerated conditions prior to long term storage at intended conditions, storage for 6 months 
at accelerated conditions, and storage for 1 month at stress conditions. Furthermore, photostability studies as 
outlined in ICH Q1B and freeze/thaw studies were performed to assess the impact of exposure to light and of 
freeze/thaw. 
The stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines Q1A and Q5C; statistical evaluation of 
stability data was performed according to ICH guideline Q1E. The analytical programme resembled the shelf-life 
specifications and included appropriate stability indicating methods.  
The claimed shelf life of 36 months at 5 ± 3°C is supported by the presented stability data. At intended 
conditions including OOF conditions all results complied with the shelf-life specification. Considering that all 
results obtained at accelerated conditions after six months and the results of the out-of-fridge study complied 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 21/127 
  
  
with the shelf life specification the proposed short term storage for one week at 25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH seems 
reasonable. 
Photostability studies confirmed that the finished product is sensitive to light stress; however, the secondary 
packaging protects the finished product adequately against light-induced deterioration. When the finished 
product was subject to 3 freeze/thaw cycles essentially no change could be observed for any parameter tested. 
Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
Overall, relevant quality attributes including stability were evaluated and the data presented in the 
comparability assessment demonstrate comparability of the finished product throughout the development 
stages. It should be noted that except for the initial, failed PK study EP-LA06-101 all clinical trial materials were 
manufactured at one of the intended commercial sites. 
For the most critical, recent transfer between the two intended commercial manufacturing sites a dedicated 
analytical comparability exercise comprising release testing, additional characterisation testing with orthogonal 
state-of-the-art analytical methods, and evaluation of stability data from intended, accelerated and stress 
conditions was conducted in line with ICH Q5E. This transfer included a moderate scale up and several technical 
adaptations which are unlikely to impact the quality of the final product. Indeed, for most attributes no relevant 
differences are evident between finished products originating from the two intended commercial manufacturing 
sites.  
Adventitious agents 
No raw materials of animal or human origin are used during the production of the finished product and therefore 
it is considered that any risk of contamination with viral adventitious agents introduced by the raw materials or 
excipients can be excluded. The active substance is manufactured in E. coli, which does not support the growth 
of viruses. A TSE statement of compliance with Note for Guidance EMA/410/01 rev.3 has been provided. 
Controls at various process stages provide for an adequate control of potential bacterial and fungal 
contaminations. 
Biosimilarity 
A global development program was designed in a stepwise approach for demonstrating biosimilarity between 
LA-EP2006 and the reference product Neulasta. The demonstration of analytical comparability between 
LA-EP2006 and EU-approved Neulasta (Neulasta EU) is the first step and foundation for demonstrating 
biosimilarity. To this end, the applicant has generated and submitted an extensive set analytical data as outlined 
below. Data from US-licensed Neulasta (Neulasta US) has also been presented and is considered supportive. 
The pivotal clinical data supporting the LA-EP2006 application is however generated using Neulasta EU. 
The approach for criticality assessment and classification quality attributes has been described and is 
scientifically sound. The criticality score is the basis for classification of quality attributes into different tiers for 
which different statistical approaches are applied in the course of the biosimilarity assessment. 
Comparability evaluation 1: Analytical data from large scale LA-EP2006 finished product batches and Neulasta 
EU and Neulasta US batches analysed over a period of several years were subjected to a statistical evaluation of 
comparability. As regards sampling of Neulasta batches, the applicant clarified that all Neulasta batches were 
randomly purchased as available on the market. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 22/127 
  
  
Quality attributes were categorised into different tiers as indicated above. Different statistical approaches were 
applied for the quality attributes of different tiers.  
In principle, the application of methods with different stringency depending on the relevance of the quality 
attribute (as defined by the tiers) is supported, descriptive evaluation (including graphs) and reporting of the 
raw data is endorsed.  
Comparability evaluation 2: In a second step a confirmatory head-to-head comparability study was performed.  
Batches of LA-EP2006 finished product were compared with batches of the reference product (Neulasta EU) and 
of the comparator product (Neulasta US). The relevant physicochemical (including PEG protein linker chemistry) 
and biological quality attributes have been characterised by a panel of highly sophisticated and state-of-the art 
methods.  
The head-to-head comparability aims to confirm the conclusions of the statistical evaluation.  
Additionally, stability of LA-EP2006 finished product at intended, accelerated, and temperature stress conditions 
as well as mechanical stress conditions was compared to that of Neulasta EU and Neulasta US 
Equivalence was demonstrated for potency (bioactivity), content and abundance of di-pegylated pegfilrastim. 
Dimer/high molecular weight variants/aggregates (HMWV), acidic variants (wrongly pegylated/deamidated 
species), were found to be lower in LA-EP2006 than in Neulasta EU and Neulasta US, while unpegylated 
filgrastim and wrongly pegylated filgrastim were also slightly lower. An array of, state-of-the-art methods for 
physicochemical characterization were used. The comparability was confirmed based on intact molecular mass 
(MALDI-TOF-MS), primary structure (peptide mapping with UV and mass detection), secondary structure (CD 
spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy), molecular size (SEC, SDS-PAGE, SEC-MALLS, and AFF-MALLS), charge 
(CEX), and hydrophobicity (RP-HPLC). Correct N-terminal pegylation was shown by peptide mapping and 
MALDI-TOF-MS. Comparability of the PEG portion of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta (EU and US) was demonstrated by 
MALDI-TOF MS, SEC & AF4 – MALLS and intact mass ESI-MS. Using micro flow imaging (MFI), similar amounts 
of sub-visible particles were observed for LA-EP2006, Neulasta EU/Neulasta US.  
Oxidised species were also generally lower in LA-EP2006. Overall, LA-EP2006 demonstrates a slightly ‘purer’ 
profile than Neulasta, and the minor differences are not considered to be meaningful in terms of potential to 
affect potency or safety. 
Despite their apparent comparability in terms of quality attributes, an overexposure under LA-EP2006 treatment 
as compared to the reference was observed in the clinical studies between LA-EP2006 and Neulasta. The 
applicant analysed the potential impact of even slight differences in quality attributes in terms of their potential 
to affect PK. Overall, LA-EP2006 contains less product-related variants than Neulasta. The observed difference 
in deamidated variants cannot, however, explain the PK results, as these variants have full bioactivity. Three 
quality attributes with a potential impact on PK, showed slight differences compared to Neulasta, namely levels 
of di-pegylated filgrastim, unpegylated filgrastim and HMWV. The levels of di-pegylated filgrastim and 
unpegylated filgrastim are however too low to explain the PK results. The slightly lower levels of HMWV in 
LA-EP2006 would support a lower PK, which is in contrast to the clinical results. The difference in PK results for 
LA-EP2006 and Neulasta cannot be explained by differences in quality attributes. From a quality perspective, 
LA-EP2006 can be considered comparable to Neulasta. 
The tables below provide an overview of the comparability exercise performed at the quality level.

In summary, the applicant has provided an in-depth characterisation of the physiochemical and characteristics 
and biological activity of LA-EP2006 batches throughout development as well as of Neulasta EU and Neulasta US. 
A comprehensive head-to-head comparability exercise was also performed. The biosimilarity exercise was 
conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines.  
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
The applicant initially considered the PEG moiety as starting material and a major objection was raised in this 
regard. In line with ICH Q11 and the Reflection paper on the requirements for selection and justification of 
starting materials for the manufacture of chemical active substances (EMA/448443/2014), the PEG moiety has 
been re-defined as an intermediate. This re-definition included provision of the additional information on the 
manufacture and control of PEG.  
Regarding biosimilarity, the applicant has conducted a robust and extensive overall biosimilarity exercise 
including a panel of highly sophisticated and state-of-the art methods, which characterises and compares the 
relevant physicochemical and biological quality attributes of the pegfilgrastim molecule. The data derived from 
these studies demonstrate similarity to the reference medicinal product.  
From a quality point of view the marketing authorisation application for Ziextenzo is considered approvable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a non-clinical development programme that included in vitro studies and in vivo studies 
on rats, rabbits and dogs in order to determine similarity between LA-EP2006 and the reference product 
Neulasta. Comparative PD in vivo studies were performed in naïve and neutropenic rats and in non-neutropenic 
rabbits and dogs. Comparative PK studies were assessed in naïve and neutropenic rats. Toxicology studies were 
performed in rats and rabbits.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
The potency of LA-EP2006 was assessed by determining the proliferative effect on NFS-60 cells.

In vivo studies 
The studies were conducted in rats, rabbits and dogs and the subcutaneous (s.c.) route of administration was 
selected in accordance with the Neulasta Summary of Product Characteristics (Neulasta SmPC) and the intended 
route of administration for LA-EP2006. The primary endpoints of studies performed on rodent (neutropenic and 
non-neutropenic) were the measurement of ANC or PD parameters derived from ANC, respectively AUEC (Area 
under effect curve) and Emax (Maximum response of efficacy achieved).

Repeat dose toxicity 
Table 9:  
Summary of findings in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats 
No mortality occurred in the animals assigned to the studies. 
LA-EP06-003 findings: 
A marked increase in leukocytes, mainly due to a very marked increase in neutrophils but also to marked 
increases in basophils, monocytes and large unstained cells, and an increased number of high fluorescent 
reticulocytes was noted in both sexes at all dose levels for both products. 
An increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(ASAT) and creatine kinase (CK), changes in plasma protein levels and decreased levels of phospholipids were 
noted in both sexes mainly at all dose levels. Decreased triglyceride levels (all dose levels) and increased 
calcium concentration (1000 mcg/kg) were noted in males only, and increased phosphorus concentration in 
females only at all dose levels. 
Increased spleen weights were recorded in both sexes at all dose levels at necropsy, along with decreased heart 
and seminal vesicle weights in males at all dose levels and decreased thymus weights in females at 500 µg/kg 
LA-EP2006 and 1000 µg/kg LA-EP2006 or Neulasta. Macroscopic findings consisted of enlarged spleens in both

sexes at all dose levels and thickened ankle joints in males given 100 µg/kg LA-EP2006 and in both sexes at all 
other dose levels of LA-EP2006 or Neulasta.  
Microscopically, these findings correlated with increased granulopoiesis in the spleen in both sexes at all dose 
levels, and myelofibrosis, osteomyelitis and arthritis/periostitis in the ankle joints in males given 100 µg/kg 
LA-EP2006 and in both sexes at all other dose levels of LA-EP2006 or Neulasta.  
Further microscopic findings related to the treatment and observed at all dose levels were increased 
granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, emperipolesis in megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen, 
granulocytosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, and myelofibrosis and osteomyelitis in the 
epiphyseal ossification area in femur with stifle joint. At 1000 µg/kg, impaired ossification in the growth plate 
region and arthritis/periostitis of the stifle joint was seen in several animals. 
Beyond the above mentioned clinical signs, other findings were noted in single animals, including scabs or 
localized hair loss. 
After 4 weeks of recovery, most findings had completely or almost completely reversed. 
LA-EP06-005 findings: 
At necropsy, an enlarged spleen was noted in the male rats treated subcutaneously with 100 μg LA-EP2006/kg 
every other day for 13 days or with 50, 75 or 100 μg/kg every other day for 29 days (15 applications). 
Furthermore, 75 or 100 μg/kg every other day for 29 days (15 applications) revealed swollen left and/or right 
ankle joints of the hind legs. 
The histological examination of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric) and the bone marrow 
revealed test item-related changes in the male rats treated subcutaneously with LA-EP2006 every other day at 
doses of 100 µg/kg for 13 days, 12.5, 25, 50, 75 or 100 µg/kg for 29 days or with 1000 µg LA-EP2006/kg every 
week for 29 days, which are considered to be related to the administration of pegfilgrastim. 
Test item related organ changes were noted in form of activation of hematopoiesis, especially the cytopoiesis of 
the granulocytes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, which are considered to be pharmacodynamic effects of 
the test item. A dose-related activation of hematopoiesis was noted for the 4-week treatment except for 
individual outliers. 
Furthermore, subcutaneous treatment with 100 µg LA-EP2006/kg every other day for 13 days or with 50, 75 or 
100 µg/kg every other day for 29 days revealed a focal osteodystrophy. This finding appeared to be test 
item-related, but did not occur in the high dose group of 1000 µg LA-EP2006/kg. Probably, the high dose group 
was not affected due to the larger time interval of treatment. 
LA-EP06-006 findings: 
Changes in form of swollen ankle joints and/or feet (hindlegs) were noted for animals of all test or reference 
item-treated groups. In addition, swollen forepaws were noted for some animals treated with 200 μg LA-EP2006 
or Neulasta/kg b.w. every other day for 4 weeks. 
The number of leucocytes was increased for all test or reference item-treated animals compared to the control. 
This increased number of leucocytes was predominantly caused by an increased number of neutrophilic 
granulocytes but also by an increased absolute number of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes, 
large unstained cells and basophilic granulocytes compared to the control. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018

Increased plasma activities of alkaline phosphatase (aP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) were noted for the rats treated subcutaneously with LA-EP2006 or Neulasta compared to 
the control of test day 30. 
At histopathological examination, test item-related organ changes in form of increased granulocytopoiesis were 
noted in the bone marrow. Activation of haematopoiesis /granulocytopoiesis was noted in the spleen, liver and 
adrenal glands. Further, granulocytosis was noted in the lungs. These changes are considered to be 
pharmacodynamic effects of the test item.  
Test item-related pathological changes in form of oedema, inflammation of soft tissue, destruction of joint, 
arthritis and bone destruction and fibreosseous proliferation were noted in the ankle joints and feet. In addition, 
bone remodelling of the femur and tibia was observed.

b.w. (q2d for 4 weeks) or of 1000 µg/kg b.w. (once weekly for 5 weeks) were also assessed regarding local 
tolerance in the male and female rats. This did not reveal any signs of intolerance.  
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity: 
The blood sample for the screening for binding anti-Pegfilgrastim antibodies was taken two weeks after the last 
application of study medication from animals treated with all regimens except Regimen 3 and 8 (100 Pg/kg q2d 
for 2 weeks) from which no samples were taken. Animals from the main allocation group “TK/PD Profile 2” were 
killed right after the antibody screening sample had been taken. 
A total of 287 serum samples from preclinical study no. LA-EP06-006 was analysed by ELISA to determine 
anti-Pegfilgrastim antibodies in serum.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2) which states that proteins are exempted from the need to submit studies because 
they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment due to their nature, the applicant submitted a 
justification for not submitting an environmental risk assessment. 
Pegfilgrastim is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated. The PEG moiety of Pelmeg is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment 
because of metabolic breakdown before excretion in patients9, 10 and a rapid biodegradation in the 
environment11, 12. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Biosimilarity regarding receptor binding (SPR based approach) and in vitro functionality (NFS-60 cell-based 
proliferation assay) was shown. Additionally, in vivo studies in beagles, rabbits and rats were performed 
indicating no differences in terms of PD parameters. Although studies in naïve and neutropenic rats suffered 
from high inter-individual variability, an overly susceptible rat strain (Wistar) and potential differences in 
myelosuppressive effects induced by 5-FU or CPA, no relevant differences were observed between the 
treatments.  
Regarding non-clinical PK, a higher exposure was observed in four of the seven studies in naïve animals (rabbit, 
dog and rat). Further four studies examining PK in states of neutropenia in the rat, showed as well a higher 
exposure for LA-EP2006 compared to EU-authorized Neulasta. While the PK studies suffered from

inter-individual variability, there were no relevant differences between the test and the reference product and as 
as such the preclinical PK data support the totality of evidence for biosimilarity. 
The toxicological assessment has been conducted and indicated no toxicological differences between LA-EP2006 
and Neulasta. No new unexpected toxicities were identified for LA-EP2006. Some minor differences were 
observed what could be attributed to inter-individual variability but this has no impact on the overall 
biosimilarity.  
Secondary  PD,  Safety  pharmacology,  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies,  single  dose  studies, 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproduction, fertility and developmental toxicity studies are not required for a 
biosimilar  development  program 
in  accordance  with  EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005  Rev.  1  and 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005. 
The  justification  for  not  submitting  environmental  risk  assessment  studies  is  acceptable.  It  is  unlikely  that 
residues  of  pegfilgrastim  would  persist  in  the  environment  or  cause  inadvertent  environmental  effects.  The 
approval of Ziextenzo is not expected to cause increases in environmental exposure above existing levels for this 
active substance or result in any additional hazards to the environment during storage, distribution, use and 
disposal. Considering the expected exposure and the nature of the product, the absence of formal environmental 
risk assessment studies for Ziextenzo is considered justified. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology for Ziextenzo have been well 
characterised and are considered acceptable. There were no further changes to the SmPC and the product 
information is aligned with the reference product Neulasta.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of LA-EP2006. One study was a randomized, three-arm, 
parallel group PK/PD (study LA-EP06-101) in 279 healthy volunteers, using Neulasta EU and Neulasta US as 
active comparators. The second PK/PD study (LA-EP06-103) was initiated after failure of study LA-EP06-101, as 
the similarity of LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta could not be demonstrated for the primary endpoint AUC0-tlast 
as well as the secondary endpoints Cmax and AUCo-∞. This was a randomised, two-period cross-over PK/PD 
study in 184 healthy volunteers, using only Neulasta EU as comparator. The third study was an exploratory PK 
sub-study of the confirmatory efficacy and safety study LA-EP06-302, where 60 patients with breast cancer 
were included. 
Absorption 
Study LA-EP06-101 
Design: 
This was a randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group study to determine the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics and safety of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta (EU- and US registered) in healthy subjects 
A parallel design was chosen by the applicant due to the long half-life of the product, anticipated period effects 
and the complexity to attribute immunogenicity results to specific products. 
Study period: 24-Jun-2010 to 28-Dec-2010 
Population: 
The study was powered to demonstrate PK equivalence of LA-EP2006 and both Neulasta products, assuming an 
inter-subject variability of 35%. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 10% to achieve 84 completers per treatment

arm, a total of 279 Caucasian subjects, 156 (55.9%) male and 123 (44.1%) female aged 18 to 55 years were 
randomized at a single centre in Germany with 93 subjects per treatment group (1:1:1). 
Treatment: 
Each enrolled subject received a single dose of pegfilgrastim 6 mg LA-EP2006 or EU sourced Neulasta or US 
sourced Neulasta into the abdominal area, which is the only dose approved and currently used for the 
comparator product. Randomization was stratified by body weight (weight bands of 10 kg were applied, i.e. 
50.0-59.9 kg, 60.0-69.9 kg, 70.0-79.9 kg, 80.0-89.9 kg, and 90.0-99.9 kg) and gender. The randomisation plan 
is considered adequate. 
The test product used was from a pre-commercial production process. A comparable quality profile of the 
LA-EP2006 batch used in this PK/PD study with the intended commercial material has been provided, which is 
considered sufficient. 
The study was performed in a -blinded manner. The measures taken to organise and keep the blinding are 
considered adequate. 
Sampling time points: 
• 
PK: 24 blood samples for measurement of serum pegfilgrastim will be taken pre-dose and 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48 , 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 264 and 336 h (d 14) post dose.   
• 
Immunogenicity: Blood samples will be collected at 15 minutes pre-dose on Day 1, and on Days 15 and 
28 for detection of antibody formation against pegfilgrastim. 
• 
Laboratory and urinalysis: Blood and urine samples will be taken for laboratory safety tests at screening, 
and in the morning on Days –1, 3, 7 (±1 day) and 15 (follow-up visit). 
The sampling time points are adequate to reflect the characteristics of pegfilgrastim and gain respective data for 
a comparative evaluation of the critical PK parameters.

PK values were generally higher for LA-EP2006 with a mean AUC0→last of 8215 h ng/mL (Neulasta EU: 7276.7

pegfilgrastim concentration was below LLOQ at the last sampling time point at day 15, therefore mean AUC0→∞ 
values were only slightly different to the mean values of AUC0→last. The median tmax ranged between 16 and 
24 hours among all three pegfilgrastim products with LA-EP2006 showing the highest value. The elimination rate

Study LA-EP06-103 
This was a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single subcutaneous administration of LA-EP2006 and a single 
subcutaneous administration of Neulasta (EU-authorized) in healthy subjects. 
Study period: 18 February 2016 to 16 January 2017 
Subjects were randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences, in a ratio of 1:1.  
- Treatment sequence 1: LA-EP2006 (test treatment) in Period I, followed by Neulasta EU (reference treatment) 
in Period II 
- Treatment sequence 2: Neulasta EU (reference treatment) in Period I, followed by LA-EP2006 (test treatment) 
in Period II 
Randomization was stratified by body weight and gender. 
Population: 
A total of 446 subjects were screened. Of these, a total of 185 subjects were randomized and 184 subjects, with 
92 subjects per treatment sequence, received study medication. 
The study was initially planned to randomize approximately 130 subjects (65 per treatment sequence) at a 
single investigational site. After a discussion during a meeting with European Health Authorities in June 2016, 
the sample size was re-estimated and was increased to approximately 184 subjects (92 per treatment 
sequence). 
Treatment: 
In each period, a single 6 mg s.c. dose of LA-EP2006 or Neulasta EU was administered into the s.c. tissue of the 
lower abdomen of healthy volunteers by the same unblinded investigator per dosing day and throughout the 
study. There was a wash-out period of at least 8 weeks between the 2 IMP administrations. 
The study was performed in a blinded manner. The measures taken to organise and keep the blinding are 
considered adequate. 
Sampling time-points 
• 
• 
PK/PD: 19 blood samples for measurement of serum pegfilgrastim will be taken pre-dose (-15 min) and 
, 4, 8, 12,  24, 36, 48 , 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 264 and 336 h (d 14) post dose.   
Immunogenicity: Blood samples will be collected at 15 minutes pre-dose on Day 1, and on Days 15 and 
28 for detection of antibody formation against pegfilgrastim. 
A positive ADA screening assay result (result above the screening assay cut-point) resulted in exclusion from 
participation in the study without further conducting a confirmatory assay. 
• 
Laboratory and urinalysis: Blood and urine samples will be taken for laboratory safety tests at screening, 
and on Days –1, 3, 7 (±1 day) and 28 (follow-up visit).

In both periods, the baseline characteristics were similar for both treatment groups. For most baseline 
characteristics, mean values were also similar at the start of Period I and Period II.  
One subject randomized to receive Neulasta EU / LA-EP2006 did not receive study medication due to major 
difficulties in obtaining blood samples.

Table 16:  
Subject disposition including screening failures- Study LA-EP06-103 
In total 15 of 184 dosed subjects withdrew from the study due to various reasons; 6 subjects (7%) in the 
LA-EP2006 / Neulasta EU treatment sequence group, and 9 subjects (10%) in the Neulasta EU / LA-EP2006 
treatment sequence group. They included withdrawal by subject (n=1 and n=5 for LA-EP2006/Neulasta and 
Neulasta/LA-EP2006 respectively), discontinuation due to AEs (n=2 for both treatment arms) and 
discontinuation due to other reasons (n=3 and n=2 for LA-EP2006/Neulasta and Neulasta/LA-EP2006 
respectively). Other reasons were positive drug screening test, positive ADAs and differing body weight (all prior 
beginning of Period II) and were pre-specified.   
The last sampling time points for three subjects were excluded for the calculation of PK parameters in Period I 
because the terminal phase could not be properly defined (as they had values above the LLOQ after 5, 5 and 4 
values, respectively, below the LLOQ). Individual concentration profiles were provided.  
There were four protocol amendments.  
Results 
PK biosimilarity has been demonstrated as all the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio of all 
primary PK parameters (AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax) are entirely contained in the pre-specified [80-125%] 
interval. Point estimates and respective 90 % CIs for the ratios of the geometric means for LA-EP2006 and 
Neulasta EU were 1.14 [1.06 – 1.22] for AUC0-inf, 1.14 [1.06 – 1.23] for AUC0-last, 1.11 [1.03 – 1.19] for 
Cmax. 
The extrapolated portion of AUC0-inf was <5% of the AUC in most subjects, confirming that the sampling period 
was sufficiently long. One subject showed an extrapolated part of AUC0-inf >20% and was excluded from the 
primary analysis of AUC0-inf. Intra- and inter-individual variation were around 40% and 60-80%, respectively, 
which was within the expected range.

Following administration of single 6 mg s.c. doses of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU, quantifiable serum 
concentrations of pegfilgrastim were present from the first sampling time point 4 hours post dose. The 
pegfilgrastim concentrations increased rapidly, with maximum concentrations reached between 12 and 36 
hours. Thereafter, the mean pegfilgrastim concentrations decreased very slowly until 48 hours post dose and 
then more rapidly from then on. By Day 6 (120 hours post dose), for more than 50% of subjects the 
pegfilgrastim serum concentrations had fallen below the LLOQ. From Day 8 (168 hours post dose), pegfilgrastim 
serum concentrations were below the LLOQ in all samples. 
Descriptive statistics were also provided: mean pegfilgrastim serum concentrations were numerically higher 
following LA-EP2006 treatment. Median tmax was 12 hours for both treatments. Mean (SD) t½ was 17.9 (18.9) 
hours for LA-EP2006 and 18.2 (20.4) hours for Neulasta EU.  Compared to results from study -101, tmax and 
t1/2 showed lower values (median tmax: 24 and 20 hours; mean t1/2 [SD]: 42.9 [16.1] and 44.6 [19.7] hours 
for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU respectively).

PK Sub-Study LA-EP06-302 
Design:  
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-center Phase III study in patients with 
histologically proven breast cancer having an indication for neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment with TAC 
(Taxotere [docetaxel] in combination with Adriamycin [doxorubicin] and Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide]) 
chemotherapy, eligible to receive six cycles of chemotherapy. 
PK is to be evaluated in a PK/ECG subgroup. 
Study population of PK-Subset: 
The evaluation of PK and triplicate ECG assessment during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy were performed on a subset 
of 58 study patients randomized 1:1 in Neulasta or LA-EP2006 treatment arm, stratified by chemotherapy 
category (adjuvant or neo-adjuvant) and weight class (< 65kg; ≥ 65kg to < 80kg; ≥ 80kg). 
A total of 60 patients were randomised to the PK subgroup. 
The ECG/PK subgroup had specific additional cardiac exclusion criteria concerning significant cardiac disease, 
arrhythmias, QTCF >480 ms or concomitant use of medications known to have effect on any of the above ECG 
parameters and primary or secondary endpoints. 
Treatments: 
Patients received LA-EP2006 or Neulasta EU at a dose of 6 mg/0.6 mL s.c. on day 2 following TAC (Taxotere 
[docetaxel 75 mg/m2] in combination with Adriamycin [doxorubicin 50 mg/m2] and Cytoxan 
[cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2]) chemotherapy on day 1 for up to six cycles. 
PK Endpoints (secondary objective within this study): 
• 
PK profile consisting of a pre-dose measurement of PEG-filgrastim serum and daily measurements after 
the first administration of study drug in cycle 1 of chemotherapy. 
• 
Cmax and AUC0-last of pegfilgrastim concentrations within 24 hours after the first administration of 
study drug in cycle 1 of chemotherapy. 
• 
Trough concentrations on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6. 
Sampling time points: 
• 
Cycle 1: PK profile pre-dose on Day 1, on Day 2 and on the following days until Day 15 prior to 
pegfilgrastim administration. 
• 
Subsequent cycles: Trough concentrations on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6 
For Cmax and AUC0-last, the ratio between LA-EP2006 and Neulasta and a 90% CI were to be calculated. 
Descriptive statistics were to be determined for Cmax and AUC0-last, the daily pegfilgrastim concentrations in 
Cycle 1, as well as Ctrough from Cycle 1 to Cycle 6.

Patient flow: 
60 patients were included (29 LA-EP2006 vs. 31 Neulasta) in the ECG/PK subset.  
58 patients had valid PK profiles, 2 Subjects (both LA-EP2006) were excluded from the PK analysis due to major 
protocol deviations: One Subject had a delayed drug administration on Day 3, another subject showed 
concentrations below LLOQ at most time points. 
After data base lock, further protocol deviations were identified, all of which were felt not to have led to exclusion 
of patients from the PP set.

Pegfilgrastim concentrations in Cycle 1 showed similar time-courses, but were numerically higher in patients 
allocated to LA-EP2006 than in patients allocated to Neulasta. Tmax were similar for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta 
(31.91h and 35.61h respectively). Afterwards, pegfilgrastim concentration slowly declined to approach pre-dose 
values. The ratio between LA-EP2006 and Neulasta for AUC0-last was 121.22% with a 90% CI of [81.62%; 
180.05%] and the ratio for Cmax was 123.22% with a 90% CI of [84.59%; 179.47%]. 90% CIs were wide due 
to a small sample size and the high variability in the PK.

The primary PD comparisons of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU are summarized in Table 28. The 95% CIs for the 
ratios (LA-EP2006/Neulasta EU) of geometric means of AUEC0-last and Emax were contained within the 
predefined equivalence limits (0.8 to 1.25). The medians for tmax.E were approximately 60 hours for both 
treatments. The mean baseline corrected ANC versus time profiles were similar for the two treatments.

Following the administration of a single 6 mg s.c. dose of either LA-EP2006 or Neulasta EU, mean baseline 
corrected ANC increased steadily to a maximum change from baseline of approximately 32×109 cells/L (32.24
×109 cells/L for LA-EP2006 and 32.23×109 cells/L for Neulasta EU) after approximately 60 hours. 
Maximum mean values for absolute ANC were 35.08×109 cells/L for LA-EP2006 and 34.97×109 cells/L for 
Neulasta EU, respectively, at 60 hours post dose. After reaching the peak, ANC decreased gradually until counts 
had returned to baseline values approximately on Day 15 (336 hours post dose).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of LA-EP2006. One study was a randomized, three-arm, 
parallel group PK/PD (study LA-EP06-101) in 279 healthy volunteers, using Neulasta EU and Neulasta US as 
active comparators. The second PK/PD study (LA-EP06-103) was initiated after failure of study LA-EP06-101, as 
the similarity of LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta could not be demonstrated for the primary endpoint 
AUC0-last as well as the secondary endpoints Cmax and AUCo-∞. This was a randomised, two-period cross-over 
PK/PD study in 184 healthy volunteers, using only Neulasta EU as comparator. The third study was an 
exploratory PK sub-study of the confirmatory efficacy and safety study LA-EP06-302, where 60 patients with 
breast cancer were included. The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, elimination, 
dose-proportionality and time dependencies, special populations, pharmacokinetics interaction studies, 
pharmacokinetics using biomaterials and mechanism of action. This is acceptable as according to the guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, these studies are not required. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
In the first PK/PD study, biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta could not be demonstrated for the 
primary endpoint AUC0-last as well as the secondary endpoints Cmax and AUCo-∞.  The point estimate of the 
geometric mean ratio (LA-EP2006 vs. Neulasta) for AUC0-last was: 109.95% with a 90% confidence interval of 
88.90 – 135.98%. Also Cmax and AUC0-∞ exceeded the pre-determined acceptance limits: 101.71% (81.24 – 
127.32%) and 110.54% (90% CI: not presented, the 95% CI was reported with 85.81-142.41) respectively. Of 
note, the observed variability of the PK parameters by far exceeded the variability assumed for sample size 
planning (CV% was in the range of 77.3-91.5% for AUC0-last). 
In the second PK/PD study, PK biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU has been demonstrated as all the 
90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio of all primary PK parameters (AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax) 
are entirely contained in the pre-specified [80-125%] interval. Point estimates and respective 90 % CIs for the 
ratios of the geometric means for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU were 1.14 [1.06 – 1.22] for AUC0-inf, 1.14 [1.06 
– 1.23] for AUC0-last, 1.11 [1.03 – 1.19] for Cmax.  
Despite falling within the usually applied [80 - 125 %] acceptance boundaries for showing equivalence in PK, the 
CIs in this case do not cover 100% for all primary PK parameters investigated.  The extrapolated portion of 
AUC0-inf was <5% of the AUC in most subjects. Intra- and inter- individual variations were around 40% and 
60-80%, respectively, which was in the expected range. 
In study LA-EP06-103, PK biosimilarity has been formally demonstrated as all the 90% confidence intervals of 
the geometric mean ratio of all primary PK parameters (AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax) are entirely contained in the 
pre-specified [80-125%] interval. It is important to note that the higher exposure does not appear to be caused 
by a difference in elimination of the biosimilar as compared to the reference product, since the t1/2 values 
seems to be comparable (i.e. 17.9±18.9 and 18.2±.20.2 h, respectively). Median tmax was 12 hours for both 
treatments. Mean (SD) t½ was 17.9 (18.9) hours for LA-EP2006 and 18.2 (20.4) hours for Neulasta EU.  
Compared to results from study -101, tmax and t1/2 showed much lower values.  The lower values of t1/2 could 
be derived from an underestimation of the terminal half-life resulting from an increase of the LLOQ of the 
pegfilgrastim serum concentration assay from 150 pg/mL in study -101 to 1500 pg/mL in study -103. Overall, 
this does however not seem to significantly impact the outcome of the study.  
Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  excluding  from  the  AUC0-inf  analysis  all  AUC0-inf  values  where  the 
adjusted r2<0.75 and including ANC baseline values as a covariate: all results were similar to the results of the 
primary analysis.

Page 58/127 
  
  
A root cause analysis showed that a major factor contributing to the failure of study -101 was the unexpected 
high inter-subject variability and conduct as parallel group design. The high inter-subject variability has been 
addressed by using a cross-over design for study -103. In addition, sample heterogeneity has been further 
reduced by formulating stricter ANC and BMI requirements for inclusion at baseline, which are acknowledged as 
key drivers of pegfilgrastim PK. This was accepted by the CHMP.  
The total evidence from both studies indicates that the bioavailability is not increased by more than 20-25% and 
that the positive study i.e. LA-EP06-103 can be considered robust and the pivotal study for the comparison of 
the biosimilarity exercise. In the end, narrower confidence intervals for the primary endpoints in study -103 
were observed, as expected, and at the same time the point estimates (by and large) further confirmed results 
of the first, failed study -101 which hints at (desirable) concordance in terms of sensitivity between the two 
experimental settings. AUC and Cmax values were increased by around 10-14% under LA-EP2006 treatment as 
compared to reference in studies -101 & -103. A comparable increase has also been observed in breast cancer 
patients although these findings are subject to large variability (geometric mean ratio of AUC0-last = 1.21, 90% 
CI [0.82-1.80]).  
Uncertainty is however generated by the period-specific estimation of geometric mean ratios: the ratio of 
geometric means (Ziextenzo/Neulasta) of AUC and Cmax markedly differs between the two study periods. As 
the reported point estimates for the primary analysis (Cmax: 1.11, AUCinf: 1.14) are “average” values over 
these distinct quantities, conclusion of PK similarity based on interpretation of the overall study result seems 
difficult. Further analyses have been carried out to search for factors that may have contributed to the 
differential effects in the two periods. The source of this methodological issue was further narrowed down by 
period-specific subgroup analyses of male and female subjects. These results showed a treatment-by-period   
effect seems to be entirely driven by the PK data from the female subset but not in the males’ subset. Without 
further evidence of a different treatment effect based on gender or other biological characteristics, this may be 
considered a chance finding.  
Pharmacodynamics: 
Biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 was formally concluded to reference product Neulasta with respect to AUEC0→last of 
the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in both PK/PD studies.  
For study LA-EP06-101, the point estimates as well as the 95%CI were well within the predefined acceptance 
range of 87-115%. ANC AUEC0-last for LA-EP2006 vs. Neulasta EU was 100.75 [94.04-107.94] (non-baseline 
corrected values). For Study LA-EP06-103, the point estimate for ANC AUEC0-last for LA-EP2006 vs. Neulasta EU 
and  95%  CI  were  101.55  [99.48-103.66]    (baseline  corrected,  ANC  baseline  as  covariate)  and  101.61 
[99.96-103.30] (absolute values).  For the clinical efficacy studies LA-EP06-301 and-302, PD similarity could 
also be shown, using the proposed margin for the PK/PD studies (87% - 115%) for the area under the ANC effect 
curve (AUEC0-last) during Cycle 1. Ratio of the geometric means of AUEC0-last for LA-EP2006 versus Neulasta: 
study  -301:  103.26  95%  CI  (92.93-114.72),  study  -302:  102.58,  95%  CI  (94.89-110.89)  (exploratory 
analysis).  
CD34+ cell count was not assessed in the second PK/PD study, therefore no conclusions can be drawn on the 
results from study LA-EP06-101 (lower CD34+ cell counts for LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta EU).  
The observed small PK differences of LA-EP2006 compared to reference do not seem to translate into altered

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  LA-EP2006  has  been  well  characterised.  From  a  PK  perspective,  the  claim  of 
bioequivalence is acceptable since the GMR both the primary and secondary PK parameters were fully contained 
within the acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00% in the pivotal study LA-EP06-103.  
Therefore, overall PK/PD data from the two studies show that similarity between Ziextenzo and the reference 
product Neulasta could be demonstrated.

Treatments 
Figure 13: Design of study LA-EP06-301 
Patients were treated in two groups: 
•  Group 1: LA-EP2006 (investigational drug treatment) 
•  Group 2: Neulasta (control drug treatment) 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta was to be injected subcutaneously on Day 2 of each of the six chemotherapy cycles, at 
least 24 hours after chemotherapy administration in a concentration of 6 mg pegfilgrastim in 0.6 mL. 
No dose adjustments and/or interruptions were permitted. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  LA-EP2006  compared  to  Neulasta  (EU-authorized)  with 
respect to the mean duration of severe neutropenia (DSN), defined as the number of consecutive days with 
Grade  4  neutropenia  (absolute  neutrophil  count  [ANC]  less  than  0.5  ×  109/L),  during  Cycle  1  of  the 
neo-adjuvant  or  adjuvant  TAC  regimen  (Taxotere  [docetaxel  75  mg/m2]  in  combination  with  Adriamycin 
[doxorubicin 50 mg/m2] and Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2]) in breast cancer patients. 
The secondary objectives were to further compare LA-EP2006 and Neulasta with respect to the efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of both products. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean duration of Grade 4 neutropenia during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy, 
defined as the number of consecutive days in which a patient had an ANC < 0.5 × 109/L. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints  
Efficacy assessments 
• 
Incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), defined as oral temperature ≥ 38.3◦C while having an ANC < 0.5 × 
109/L (both measured on the same day) by cycle and across all cycles 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 62/127 
  
  
 
 
•  Number of days of fever, defined as oral temperature ≥ 38.3◦C, for each cycle (the analysis of this efficacy 
assessment was modified as specified in Section 9.8.3) 
•  Depth of ANC nadir, defined as the patient’s lowest ANC in Cycle 1 
• 
• 
Time to ANC recovery, defined as the time in days from the chemotherapy administration until the patient`s 
ANC increased to ≥ 2 × 109/L after the nadir, in Cycle 1 
Frequency of infection by cycle and across all cycles 
•  Mortality due to infection 
Safety assessments 
• 
Incidence, occurrence, and severity of adverse events (AEs) 
•  Assessment of local tolerability at the injection site 
•  Systemic tolerance (physical examination and safety laboratory assessments) 
•  Safety follow-up four weeks and six months after the last administration of the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) 
Immunogenicity assessments 
•  Development of binding and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies upon IMP injection. 
Sample size 
The following assumptions were made for the sample size determination based on available literature (Holmes 
et al 2002, Green et al 2003): 
• 
• 
Equivalence/non-inferiority limit: ±1 day / -0.6 days 
Expected difference in the means: 0 days 
•  Common standard deviation: 1.6 days 
• 
Power: 90% 
•  Significance level: 2.5% 
•  Randomization ratio: 1:1 (LA-EP2006:Neulasta) 
Based on these assumptions, 302 evaluable subjects were considered to be sufficient to achieve at least 90% 
power for each set of hypothesis tests, i.e. for testing equivalence with respect to a margin of ± 1 day using a 
two one-sided test procedure (TOST) for equivalence in means where each test was performed at the 2.5% level 
as well as for the two-group 2.5% one-sided t-test to assess non-inferiority with respect to a margin of -0.6 
days. Since the primary analysis will be based on the FAS population, no drop-out and/or protocol violator rate 
was considered for the sample size calculation. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 using an interactive voice response system/interactive web-based randomization 
system. Randomization was stratified by chemotherapy category (adjuvant or neoadjuvant) and region (study 
301: Europe/Asia/America). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 63/127 
  
  
Blinding (masking) 
Due to a different appearance of the primary packaging of the used IMP, pre-filled syringes of LA-EP2006 and of 
Neulasta, a full double-masking is technically not possible. An unblinded drug administrator (such as a study 
nurse) injected the entire volume of the IMP. The investigator and the patient were kept blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Patients were grouped into five analysis populations as defined below: 
Safety analysis (SAF) Set: Consists of all patients who received at least one dose of IMP (LA-EP2006 or 
Neulasta) and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. 
Full Analysis (FAS) Set: All randomized patients who received at least one dose of IMP, i.e. of either 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta. Following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, patients were analyzed according to the 
treatment they had been assigned to at randomization. 
Per Protocol (PP) Set: The PP set is a subset of the FAS including all patients who completed the first 
chemotherapy cycle without major protocol deviations. 
FAS-C Set: The FAS-C set is a subset of the FAS including all patients who received only assigned IMP 
throughout the study. 
SAF-C Set: The SAF minus C (SAF-C) population is a subset of the SAF who received only assigned IMP 
throughout the study and was additionally utilized in the analysis of the 6-month SFU period. 
The testing procedure was set up in a hierarchical structure, where first equivalence between LA-EP2006 and 
Neulasta was assessed (margin ±1 day) and only if this was successfully established, non-inferiority between 
the two products was tested using a tighter margin of -0.6 days. 
Step 1: Equivalence assessment 
The following set of hypotheses was tested at a two-sided significance level of 5%: 
H10: | μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 | ≥ 1 day 
H11: | μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 | < 1 day 
(μ = mean DSN under Neulasta and LA-EP2006, respectively) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed by means of an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with the factors 
treatment group, strata_all, and the co-variate “baseline ANC count”, with the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) based on the residual standard error and adjusted least-square means of the ANCOVA. 
The mean DSN in each treatment group and the difference of means were to be presented as well as the 95% 
confidence limit of the difference between mean DSNs in each treatment group. Equivalence was proven, if the 
CI lied entirely within the equivalence margins of ±1 day. 
Step 2: Non-inferiority assessment 
The following set of hypotheses was tested at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%: 
H20: μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006≤ -0.6 days 
H21: μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006> -0.6 days 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 64/127 
  
  
The non-inferiority analyses were conducted by means of the same ANCOVA as described for the equivalence 
assessment (Step 1), but comparing the lower bound of the 95% CI with the non-inferiority margin of -0.6 days. 
Non-inferiority of LA-EP2006 was to be concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the treatment 
difference did not exceed the -0.6 day margin (meaning that the lower bound was to lie entirely above the 
non-inferiority margin of -0.6 day). This approach was equivalent to the calculation of a one-sided 97.5% CI. 
No missing values were imputed. For the determination of DSN, the following rules applied: 
The missing value imputation refers only to the determination of severe neutropenia and not to the replacement 
of the ANC value itself. In case an ANC value is missing the following rules may be used: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The ANC before and after the missing day is ≥ 0.5 x 109/L: the day can likely be ignored as a potential 
day of severe neutropenia. However, there were exceptions to this rule, in case the potential of the 
missing ANC to fulfill the severe neutropenia definition was high, e.g. if the missing ANC value could 
have  been  the  nadir.  Such  cases  were  reviewed,  decided  upon  and  documented  at  the  BDRM  in  a 
completely blinded way. 
If  at  both  neighbouring  days  the  ANCs  are  <  0.5  x  109/L,  then  set  the  missing  day  to  severe 
neutropenia. 
If the day before is < 0.5 x 109/L and the day after ≥ 0.5 x 109/L, then the missing day is set to severe 
neutropenia. 
If the day before is ≥ 0.5 x 109/L and the day after < 0.5 x 109/L, then the missing day is set to severe 
neutropenia. 
If  any  of  the  neighbouring  days  (i.e.  2  or  more  missing  values  in  a  row)  is  also  missing,  severe 
neutropenia cannot be determined automatically. These cases were discussed in the BDRM.

Results 
Participant flow 
Eight additional patients completed the 6-month SFU period, but the visit or the visit date was not entered into 
the data base. Most patients who did not complete the 6-month SFU period refused to visit the site or were lost 
to follow-up. One patient in the LA-EP2006 treatment group died due to disease progression. 
Recruitment 
This was a multi-center, multinational trial conducted in 42 sites in Brazil, India, Mexico, Romania, Russia, and  
Ukraine. 
The first patient entered the study on 28-Jun-2012 and the last completed the treatment period of the study on 
07-Sep-2013; last patient last visit after the 6-month SFU was on 11-Feb-2014.

Table 25: Screening and randomisation status (all patients screened) 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended once.  
Amendment 1 (03-Sep-2012), issued approximately 10 weeks after first patient first visit, introduced the 
following changes: 
• 
• 
Extension of patients’ maximum screening period from 15 to 21 days 
Implementation of patients’ re-screening procedures 
•  Changes to the wording of inclusion criterion 11 and exclusion criteria 4 and 12 
•  Addition of serum sample collection at the safety follow-up visit 
•  Addition of protocol specific SAE documentation requirements 
•  Administrative corrections/ corrections of typing errors 
The informed consent was updated to reflect the amendment. 
The amendment was not considered to have affected the interpretation of study results as they occurred prior 
to study unblinding. 
In total, 22 major protocol deviations occurred in 21 patients (LA-EP2006: 13 patients, Neulasta: 8 patients). 
Most frequent reasons for the exclusion of patients from the PP set were use of commercial (peg)filgrastim, 
IMP-related reasons, and missing ANC data.

Treatments 
Figure 15: Design of study LA-EP06-302 
Patients were treated in two groups: 
•  Group 1: LA-EP2006 (investigational drug treatment) 
•  Group 2: Neulasta (control drug treatment) 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta was to be injected subcutaneously on Day 2 of each of the six chemotherapy cycles, at 
least 24 hours after chemotherapy administration in a concentration of 6 mg pegfilgrastim in 0.6 mL. 
No dose adjustments and/or interruptions were permitted. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta 
(EU-authorized) with respect to the mean duration of severe neutropenia (DSN), defined as the number of 
consecutive days with grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] less than 0.5 × 109/L), during 
Cycle 1 of the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant TAC regimen (Taxotere [docetaxel 75 mg/m2] in combination with 
Adriamycin [doxorubicin 50 mg/m2] and Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2]) in breast cancer patients. 
The secondary objectives were to further compare LA-EP2006 and Neulasta with respect to the efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of both products. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the mean duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during Cycle 1 
of chemotherapy, defined as the number of consecutive days in which a patient had an ANC < 0.5 × 109/L. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints – the depth of ANC nadir, defined as the patient’s lowest ANC in Cycle 1, and 
time to ANC recovery, defined as the time from the chemotherapy administration until the ANC increased to ≥ 
2 × 109/L after the nadir – were also assessed during Cycle 1. 
Other secondary endpoints:

• 
Incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), defined as oral temperature ≥ 38.3◦C while having an ANC < 0.5 ×

•  Number of days of fever, defined as oral temperature ≥ 38.3◦C, for each cycle 
•  Depth of ANC nadir, defined as the patient’s lowest ANC in Cycle 1

ANC increased to ≥ 2 × 109/L after the nadir, in Cycle 1 
Frequency of infection by cycle and across all cycles 
•  Mortality due to infection 
Safety assessments 
• 
Incidence, occurrence, and severity of adverse events (AEs) 
•  Assessment of local tolerability at the injection site 
•  Systemic tolerance (physical examination and safety laboratory assessments) 
•  Safety follow-up including immunogenicity assessment four weeks after the last administration of the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
Immunogenicity assessments 
•  Development of binding and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies upon IMP injection.  
Sample size 
The following assumptions were made for the sample size determination based on available literature (Green et 
al 2003, Holmes et al 2002): 
• 
• 
Equivalence limit / non-inferiority limit: ±1 day / -0.6 days 
Expected difference in the means: 0 days 
•  Common standard deviation: 1.6 days 
• 
Power: 90% 
•  Significance level: 2.5% 
•  Randomization ratio: 1:1 (LA-EP2006 : Neulasta) 
Based on these assumptions, 302 evaluable subjects were considered to be sufficient to achieve at least 90% 
power for each set of hypothesis tests, i.e. for testing equivalence with respect to a margin of ± 1 day using a 
two one-sided test procedure (TOST) for equivalence in means where each test was performed at the 2.5% level 
as well as for the two-group 2.5% one-sided t-test to assess non-inferiority with respect to a margin of -0.6 
days. Since the primary analysis was based on the FAS set, no drop-out and/or protocol deviator rate was 
considered for the sample size calculation.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 using an interactive voice response system/interactive web-based randomization 
system. Randomization was stratified by chemotherapy category (adjuvant or neoadjuvant) and region 
(US/Asia/rest of world). 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to a different appearance of the primary packaging of the used IMP, pre-filled syringes of LA-EP2006 and of 
Neulasta, a full double-masking is technically not possible. An unblinded drug administrator (such as a study 
nurse) injected the entire volume of the IMP. The investigator and the patient were kept blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Patients were grouped into 6 analysis populations as defined below: 
Safety analysis (SAF) Set: Consists of all patients who received at least one dose of IMP (LA-EP2006 or 
Neulasta) and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. 
Full analysis (FAS) Set: All randomized patients who received at least one dose of IMP, i.e. of either 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the 
treatment they had been assigned to at randomization. 
Per protocol (PP) Set: The PP set is a subset of the FAS including all patients who completed the first 
chemotherapy cycle without major protocol deviations. 
FAS-C Set: The FAS-C set is a subset of the FAS including all patients who received only assigned IMP 
throughout the study. (This set is referred to as “Valid Case” (VC) set in the SAP. However, in order to clarify that 
it is by nature a subset of the FAS, the name was changed accordingly after SAP finalization.) 
PK Analysis (PK) Set: All patients who participated in the PK sub-study with a valid (as defined during the 
blind data review meeting [BDRM]) PK profile. 
ECG Analysis (ECG) Set: All patients who participated in the ECG sub-study with at least one available 
baseline triplicate measurement and at least one on-treatment ECG triplicate measurement (after IMP 
administration), and all patients without violation of the cardiac exclusion criteria. 
The testing procedure was set up in a hierarchical structure, where first equivalence between LA-EP2006 and 
Neulasta was assessed (margin ±1 day) and only if this was successfully established, non-inferiority between 
the two products was tested using a tighter margin of -0.6 days. 
Step 1: Equivalence assessment 
The following set of hypotheses was tested at a two-sided significance level of 5%: 
H10: | μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 | ≥ 1 day 
H11: | μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 | < 1 day 
(μ = mean DSN under Neulasta and LA-EP2006, respectively) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed by means of an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with the factors 
treatment group, region, chemotherapy (adjuvant vs. neoadjuvant), and the co-variate “baseline ANC count”, 
Assessment report

with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the residual standard error and adjusted 
least-square means of the ANCOVA. 
The mean DSN in each treatment group and the difference of means were to be presented as well as the 95% 
confidence limit of the difference between mean DSNs in each treatment group. Equivalence was proven, if the 
CI was entirely within the equivalence margins of ±1 day. 
Step 2: Non-inferiority assessment 
The following set of hypotheses was tested at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%: 
H20: μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 ≤ -0.6 days 
H21: μNeulasta – μLA-EP2006 > -0.6 days 
The non-inferiority analyses were conducted by means of the same ANCOVA as described for the equivalence 
assessment (Step 1), but comparing the lower bound of the 95% CI with the non-inferiority margin of -0.6 days. 
Non-inferiority of LA-EP2006 was to be concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the treatment 
difference did not exceed the -0.6 days margin (meaning that the lower bound was to lie entirely above the 
noninferiority margin of -0.6 days). This approach was equivalent to the calculation of a onesided 97.5% CI.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
For the combined efficacy analysis, data from studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 were pooled (Pool 1) as 
both studies were overall identical in design. The factor “study” was taken into account in this pooled analysis, 
and a Poisson regression was performed as a sensitivity analysis.  The total number of patients in Pool 1 was 
624. Number of patients in each study and analysis set defined for combined analyses are presented. 
Number of patients in Pool 1, LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 
The clinical data cut-off for Pool 1 was the end of the follow-up period, which occurred 4 weeks after the last 
study drug administration for LA-EP06-302 and 6 months after the study drug administration for LA-EP06-301.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant compared clinical efficacy and safety of LA-EP2006 with that of Neulasta EU in two independent 
double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multi-center studies of nearly identical design. Studies 
[LA-EP06-301] and [LA-EP06-302] were both designed to assess equivalence and non-inferiority of LA-EP2006 
to Neulasta EU in 302 female patients with breast cancer treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (TAC). 
The applicant recruited women of 18 years or older with histologically proven breast cancer who were eligible for 
six cycles of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment with TAC chemotherapy for both studies, which was deemed 
acceptable. 
The applicant states that due to transient shortages of IMP in the two studies, 70 patients in study LA-EP06-301 
(LA-EP2006: 28 patients; Neulasta EU: 42 patients) and 73 patients in study LA-EP06-302 (LA-EP2006: 32 
patients; Neulasta EU: 41 patients) received one or more administrations of commercial G-CSF containing 
product instead of IMP. In case this happened in treatment cycle 1 (before the primary endpoint) this was 
considered a major protocol deviations and patients were excluded from the PP set. To characterise the impact 
of the use of commercial G-CSF the applicant implemented a FAS-C, where all patients who received the 
commercial product at some point, were excluded. Most patients completed Cycle 1 without temporarily 
“switching” to commercial products. The results of the PP and FAS-C are consistent with the FAS. It can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 94/127 
  
  
 
 
agreed that the exclusion of this low number of patients is not considered to compromise the validity of the 
primary endpoint.  
In both studies, 38 major protocol deviations were noted in 36 patients. The deviations occurred in 19 patients 
from the LA-EP2006 treatment arms and in 17 of the Neulasta treatment arms. Most frequent reasons for the 
exclusion of patients from the PP set were use of commercial (peg)filgrastim, IMP-related reasons, and missing 
ANC data. The distribution of major protocol deviations between the treatment groups  of studies LA-EP06-301 
and LA-EP06-302  does not suggest an impact on the analysis of efficacy. 
The choice and definition of the primary measure is derived from the EMA Guideline on Biosimilar GCSF and has 
also been accepted during EMA scientific advice. Equivalence margins have been discussed regarding their 
clinical relevance and possible preservations of clinical effect. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The applicant demonstrated similarity between the biosimilar candidate and Neulasta-EU in terms of efficacy as 
measured by the duration of severe neutropenia. 
The primary endpoint, duration of severe neutropenia, has been analysed and compared in both LA-EP06-301 
and LA-EP06-302. In general the mean duration of SN was lower in study LA-EP06-301, however both studies 
(and all treatment arms) presented comparable median values (1,00d). The 95% CI of the difference in DSN 
was easily preserved within the predefined equivalence margins of +/- 1d and consecutively within the more 
narrow NI margin (-0,6d) for both studies in the FAS. Sensitivity analyses using the same ANCOVA for the 
per-protocol (PP) set and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) corroborated the results of the primary endpoint. 
Similarity for the primary measure was also shown in the pooled analysis across the two trials(-0.04 [-0.19, 
0.11]). Not only the duration of SN was comparable but also its respective incidence and timing. 
The applicant also presented comparative data of predefined secondary measures for both efficacy trials. The 
presented data was mainly derived from the FAS set, however, especially for measures, that look beyond cycle 
one, such as frequency of infections, mortality due to infections, and incidence of fever as well as febrile 
neutropenia, the FAS set alone is not considered the relevant analysis set. It includes patients, who were treated 
with commercial GCSF due to shortages of IMP.  Looking at the whole study duration, the FAS-C set is 
considered most sensitive, since it excludes all patients with major protocol deviations or treated with 
commercial products. The company has additionally provided tables for the FAS-C set widely confirming the 
results seen in the FAS set.  
Incidence of febrile neutropenia and incidence of fever can be considered similar between treatments and across 
trials.  
The incidence of febrile neutropenia suggests a small trend towards a lower incidence for the biosimilar 
candidate, a trend, that in both trials originates from numerical differences observed in Cycle one, while after 
that, the trend vanishes or slightly reverses (without meaningful differences however).  
The depth of ANC nadir was comparable between treatments with rather high SD and was in most cases reached 
around day 7. Interestingly the mean for this measure for both treatments was about 2-3 fold lower in study 
LA-EP06-302. [(Study LA-EP06-301, mean (± standard deviation [SD]) ANC nadir was 1.102 (± 1.5398) × 
109/L in patients treated with LA-EP2006 and 0.921 (± 1.1771) × 109/L in patients treated with Neulasta EU.)  
In study LA-EP06-302, ANC nadir was 0.490 (± 0.7205) × 109/L in patients treated with LA-EP2006 and 0.444 
(± 0.5684) × 109/L in patients treated with Neulasta EU)]. Time to ANC recovery was almost identical between 
treatments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 95/127 
  
  
The applicant has compared the FAS set with PP and FAS-C set and no relevant differences between analysis sets 
were observed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical data in the trials LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy has 
shown comparable efficacy between Ziextenzo and Neulasta in reducing the duration of severe neutropenia. 
Hence, Therapeutic equivalence has been robustly shown for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU-sourced in two clinical 
studies conducted in the target population, which support the claim for biosimilarity. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The studies or sources of data which contributed to the assessment of safety comprised: 
•  One PK/PD study in healthy volunteers comparing LA-EP2006 with Neulasta EU and Neulasta US 
(LA-EP06-101) 
•  One PK/PD study in healthy volunteers comparing LA-EP2006 with Neulasta EU (LA-EP06-103) 
• 
Two confirmatory efficacy and safety studies in patients with breast cancer comparing 
Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious adverse events, 
the monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry, and urine, and the regular monitoring of vital signs, and 
physical condition. 
Study LA-EP06-101: 12-lead ECGs were performed at Screening, at pre-dose and 1 and 4 hours post dose on 
Day 1, and in the morning on Days 2, 3, 7 (±1 day) and 15 (Follow-up visit). For a part of the subjects additional 
ECG recordings were performed in triplicate. 
Local tolerability at the injection site was evaluated by the subjects themselves using a VAS and by the 
Investigator using the ISR Score. 
Study LA-EP06-103: 12-lead ECGs were performed at Screening, at pre-dose and at the follow-up visit 28 days 
post dose. Hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis were additionally evaluated at Days 3 and 7. Local 
tolerance (via VAS and ISR Score) was assessed ad Day 1 (pre dose and at 1 and 4 hours post dose), 2, 3 and 
7+-1 day. 
LA-EP2006 with Neulasta EU (LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302) 
In studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302, the safety assessments were performed during treatment with 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta EU administered as prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients with breast cancer 
receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy as neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Study LA-EP06-301 included a 
6-month safety follow-up (SFU) as required by “Guidance on similar medicinal products containing recombinant 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005) and CHMP/EMA Initial Scientific 
Advice (EMEA/H/SA/1419/1/2009/III, 19-Nov-2009). 
The potential effects of LA-EP2006, Neulasta EU and Neulasta US on cardiac repolarization and morphology were 
evaluated in healthy volunteers in study LA-EP06-101 and that of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU in a subset of 
patients in study LA-EP06-302. Study LA-EP06-101 assessed the safety of LA-EP2006 in comparison with both 
Neulasta EU and Neulasta US in healthy volunteers at a dose of 6 mg after a single subcutaneous (s.c.) 
administration. Safety of LA-EP2006 was monitored through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory

testing, vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG. Immunogenicity was assessed in all studies in terms of 
monitoring for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure in healthy volunteers 
In study LA-EP06-101 in healthy volunteers, 279 subjects were included, 93 of whom received LA-EP2006, 93 of 
whom received Neulasta EU and 93 of whom received Neulasta US. The planned dose of all three pegfilgrastim 
products was 6 mg, administered s.c. as a single injection. In the three treatment groups, actual mean (± 
standard deviation, SD) doses were 6.09 (± 0.17) mg for LA-EP2006, 6.00 (± 0.19) mg for Neulasta EU , and 
6.08 (± 0.21) mg for Neulasta US. 
In study LA-EP06-103, a total of 184 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of study medication (6 mg s.c. 
LA-EP2006 and/or 6 mg s.c. Neulasta EU). In total, LA-EP2006 was administered to 176 subjects and Neulasta 
EU was administered to 178 subjects. Of the 184 subjects exposed to study medication, 170 subjects received 
both LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU, divided over 2 treatment sequences: 86 subjects received LA-EP2006 in 
Period I and Neulasta EU in Period II and 84 subjects received Neulasta EU in Period I and LA-EP2006 in Period 
II. 
Exposure in patients with breast cancer 
A summary of the overall number of patients exposed and the overall cumulative dose in patients with breast 
cancer is presented in Table 56 and Table 57. This dataset included 624 patients, 314 of whom received 
LA-EP2006 and 310 of whom received Neulasta EU. Each patient received single s.c. administrations of 6 mg 
LA-EP2006 or Neulasta EU for up to six cycles.

Overall, n=715 (95%) TEAES related to study drug were observed under La-EP2006 treatment as compared to 
n=698 (96%) observed after Neulasta administration. No serious AEs or deaths occurred. The incidence of 
moderate severity TEAEs was similar following LA-EP2006 (19 TEAEs reported by 17 [10%] of subjects) and 
Neulasta EU (16 TEAEs reported by 13 [7%] of subjects). Except for 3 TEAEs, all TEAEs recovered/resolved 
without sequelae. One subject showed neutropenia of mild severity following Neulasta EU administration with 
suspected relationship to study drug (no follow-up occurred). The overall incidences of TEAEs can be considered 
comparable when comparing LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU.

Table 56: Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events by severity and outcome by treatment 
group and treatment period - Study LA-EP06-103 (Safety Analysis Set) 
A detailed safety profile classified by period was asked to be provided from period It appears that, overall, 
LA-EP2006 presents a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs compared to Neulasta, especially for the following 
disorders: 
-  musculoskeletal disorders (98 versus 93%), where particularly back pain (42 versus 30%) and  
arthralgia (13 versus 9%), and, to a less clear extent, bone pain, neckpain, pain in extremity, muscle 
twitching, groin pain and muscle fatigue were more abundant in the LA-EP2006 arm. In contrast, 
myalgia and musculoskeletal stiffness was observed more frequently in the Neulasta arm than in the 
LA-EP2006 arm (55 versus 46% / 9 versus 16%). 
-  General disorders (54% versus 46%), especially non-cardiac chest pain (23 versus 9 %) 
-  Nervous system disorders (68 versus 64%), especially headache (64 versus 58%) 
Gastrointestinal disorders were slightly more frequently observed in the Neulasta arm (20 versus 16%). An 
imbalance was also observed for blood lymphatic disorders, especially for the PT neutropenia (4 versus 8 %) and 
lymphadenitis (0 versus 4 %), for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta respectively. 
Breast Cancer Patients 
Studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 had almost identical designs. A brief side-by-side presentation of the 
TEAEs in both studies is presented below.

Table 57: Overview of adverse events in patients with breast cancer - Pool 1 (SAF and SAF-C sets) 
Incidence and severity were roughly comparable between Neulasta-EU and LA-EP2006. Slightly more TEAES 
(overall and study drug related) occurred in the LA-EP2006 group in both individual studies and consequently 
also in the pooled data of both trials. The incidence of study drug related TEAES in the pooled data was 
71(22,6%) in the LA-EP2006 group versus 66 (21,3%). The difference of 1,3% roughly stays the same when 
looking at the more sensitive SAF-C set (1,2%).

Table 58: TEAEs with a suspected causal relationship to IMP in healthy volunteers, by preferred 
term - Study LA-EP06-101 (Safety population) 
Even though only a single dose trial, the sensitivity of the healthy volunteer trial in terms of safety (no 
chemotherapy involved) has to be acknowledged. In study -101, the most frequently affected SOC (i.e. >10% 
of subjects in any treatment group) was musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (primarily back pain, 
myalgia and arthralgia), followed by nervous system disorders (primarily headache), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (primarily chest pain and pain), and gastrointestinal disorders (primarily nausea, 
diarrhea and vomiting). Nasopharyngitis was the only infection and infestations event reported by more than 1 
subject in any treatment group.When looking at TEAES in terms of SOC the incidence is in most of SOCs equal

or smaller for the biosimilar candidate, with some exceptions: For general disorders and administration site 
conditions the incidence  was 16 (17,20%) for LA-EP2006 versus 10 (10,75%) for Neulasta EU. There was hardly 
any difference between US originator and biosimilar 17(18.28%). A similar picture is observed for the SOC 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” which are 3,22% more abundant for the biosimilar candidate compared to Neulasta 
EU, while again, the highest incidence is observed for Neulasta US. When looking at TAES organized after 
“preferred term” the difference in Gastrointestinal Disorders is most likely derived from a 3.22% higher 
incidence in vomiting and a 1.07% (1 patient) higher incidence in diarrhoea.  
The most frequently reported TEAE was back pain, followed by headache, myalgia, and arthralgia, all of which 
were reported with frequencies >10% across the treatment groups. All other TEAEs were reported with 
frequencies < 10% by subjects in a treatment group. The most frequently reported TEAEs (back pain, myalgia 
and arthralgia) are reflective of the pharmacological effects of pegfilgrastim.

In study -103, the most frequently affected SOC (i.e. >10% of subjects in any treatment group) was 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (primarily bone pain, myalgia, back pain and musculoskeletal 
stiffness), followed by nervous system disorders (primarily headache), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (primarily injection-site pain and non-cardiac chest pain), and gastrointestinal disorders (primarily 
nausea, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain and diarrhoea).  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported by 93% (LA-EP2006) and 90% (Neulasta EU) of 
subjects, respectively; nervous system disorders were reported by 61% following both treatments; and general 
disorders and administration conditions were reported by 45% (LA-EP2006) and 42% (Neulasta EU), 
respectively. The most common (reported in >10% of subjects) drug-related TEAEs by preferred term were 
bone pain (73%), headache (74%), myalgia (60%), back pain (45%), injection site pain (22%), non-cardiac 
chest pain (19%), musculoskeletal stiffness (17%), fatigue (14%), pain in extremity (14%), nausea (13%), 
arthralgia (12%), and neck pain (11%). 
When classified by period, for period 1 LA-EP2006 presents a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs compared to 
Neulasta, especially for the following disorders: 
- 
 musculoskeletal disorders (98 versus 93%), where particularly back pain (42 versus 30%) and  
arthralgia (13 versus 9%), and, to a less clear extent, bone pain, neckpain, pain in extremity, muscle 
twitching, groin pain and muscle fatigue were more abundant in the LA-EP2006 arm. In contrast, 
myalgia and musculoskeletal stiffness was observed more frequently in the Neulasta arm than in the 
LA-EP2006 arm (55 versus 46% / 9 versus 16%). 
-  General disorders (54% versus 46%), especially non-cardiac chest pain (23 versus 9 %) 
-  Nervous system disorders (68 versus 64%), especially headache (64 versus 58%) 
Gastrointestinal disorders were slightly more frequently observed in the Neulasta arm (20 versus 16%). An 
imbalance was also observed for blood lymphatic disorders, especially for the PT neutropenia (4 versus 8 %) and 
lymphadeninits (0 versus 4 %), for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta respectively. 
Studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 independently showed comparable safety results: The overall incidences 
and pattern of TEAEs were widely similar in the LA-EP2006 treatment groups compared with the Neulasta EU 
treatment groups in both studies. Expectably, TEAEs with the highest incidences were typical chemotherapy 
induced events (alopecia, nausea, asthenia, and vomiting). The most frequently affected SOC (i.e. >10% of 
patients in either treatment group) in Pool 1 was “gastrointestinal disorders” (primarily nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea), followed by “general disorders and administration site conditions” (primarily asthenia, fatigue and 
pyrexia), “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (primarily alopecia), “blood and lymphatic system disorders” 
(primarily neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and febrile neutropenia), “musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders”, “infections and infestations”, “nervous system disorders”, “metabolism and nutrition disorders”, 
“respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders”, and “investigations”. The remaining SOCs affected were 
reported by <10% of patients in either treatment group. Findings in the SAF-C set were similar to that of the SAF 
set. 
The most common treatment related AEs were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (10,2% for 
LA-EP2006 vs 9,7% in Neulasta EU). Also other IMP related SOCs like GI disorders, General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions and Nervous system disorders, Investigations, Skin and sc. Disorders, as well as 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders display similar incidences.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No death occurred in the healthy volunteer studies. Seven patients receiving LA-EP2006 and 4 patients receiving 
Neulasta EU died during studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302. One of the 7 patients treated with LA-EP2006 
died during the 6-month SFU period of the LA-EP06-301 study. None of the TEAEs leading to death as outcome 
were suspected to be related to study drug. 
Serious adverse events 
No SAEs were observed in the healthy volunteer trial. However, in breast cancer patients, several SAEs 
occurred. Overall, serious TEAEs were reported with slightly lower frequency in the LA-EP2006 than in the 
Neulasta EU treatment group (45 [14.3%] vs. 53 [17.1%]). The most frequently affected SOCs were “blood and 
lymphatic system disorders” (primarily febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), “gastrointestinal disorders” 
(primarily abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting), “infections and infestations” (primarily neutropenic sepsis), 
and “general disorders and administration site conditions” (primarily pyrexia). Serious TEAEs that were recorded 
in ≥ 2% of patients in a treatment group were febrile neutropenia and neutropenia. 
Serious TEAEs with a suspected causal relationship to study drug as per investigator assessment occurred with 
a low incidence in both treatment groups. Overall, febrile neutropenia was reported with similar frequencies in 
the two treatment groups (LA-EP2006: 8.0%; Neulasta EU: 10.0%;), however were considered more frequently 
to be related to IMP in the LA-EP2006 treatment group as compared to the Neulasta EU treatment group (5 
[1.6%] vs 0) (as per investigator assessment). All serious AEs were linked to neutropenia, and all were 0,3% to 
1,6% more common in the La-EP2006 group.

Laboratory findings 
Healthy volunteers: 
Hematology 
Study LA-EP06-101: In the three treatment groups, the mean number of leucocytes was markedly elevated due 
to the pharmacological effect of pegfilgrastim at the 48- and 72-hour post-dose assessments but was within 
normal ranges again at the Follow-up Visit, 14 days post-dose. The proportion of lymphocytes, monocytes, 
basophils and eosinophils tended to be reduced whereas the proportion of neutrophils was elevated at 48 and 72 
hours post-dose. These observations were similar and in the same range for all pegfilgrastim products. All other 
hematological parameters assessed showed no clinical significant abnormal hematological values in any subject. 
Study LA-EP06-103: An increase in leukocyte and neutrophil counts was observed following both treatments 
due to the pharmacological effect of pegfilgrastim. Mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts measured as part of 
the clinical laboratory safety assessments peaked on Day 3 at values of approximately 3 to 4 times the ULN. On 
Day 28, mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts had returned to values within the normal range. Consistent with 
these changes, transient increases in mean values for lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils were 
observed on Day 3 and Day 7 of the study. Mean platelet counts were slightly lower on Day 3 and Day 7 
compared to baseline following both treatments. On Day 28, mean platelet counts had recovered to values 
slightly above baseline. The observed changes in mean hematology parameters were similar for LA-EP2006 and 
Neulasta EU. 
Clinical chemistry and urinalysis 
Study LA-EP06-101: Values of LDH which were elevated at the 48- and 144-hour post-dose assessments 
decreased at follow-up. There were no differences among the treatment groups and no LDH elevations in any 
single subject which were categorized as CTCAE Grade 3 or 4. 
All other clinical biochemistry and urinalysis parameters showed only incidental deviations from normal ranges 
which were of no clinical significance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 110/127 
  
  
 
 
In study LA-EP06-103, transient increases in mean values of ALP and lactate dehydrogenase were observed. 
Mean concentrations peaked on Day 7 at approximately 2x baseline values, but had returned to baseline by Day 
28. The mean peak values exceeded the ULN. In addition, small, transient increases from baseline in mean 
gamma glutamyltransferase, ALT, and AST were observed on Day 7. Mean values remained within normal 
ranges. The observed increases in mean values were similar following both treatments and were not considered 
clinically significant. No clinically important abnormalities or trends were detected in the urinalysis parameters. 
Patients with breast cancer 
In studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302, clinical laboratory evaluations for safety purposes were performed at 
screening, within 3 days before chemotherapy administration in each cycle and at end of treatment (EOT) (CBC 
for hematology efficacy parameters was measured more frequently in Cycle 1.) Clinically significant findings 
were reported as TEAEs. 
Hematology 
In both studies, numbers of patients in the SAF with clinically significant values in hematological parameters 
were similar between the treatment groups at all time points, and there were no considerable differences in 
absolute and relative changes from baseline between the treatment groups. Except for leukocytes, neutrophils 
and hemoglobin in study LA-EP06-301 and leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets in study LA-EP06-302, few 
patients (< 6%) in either treatment group had hematological parameters that were abnormal and clinically 
significant:

platelets (Cycle 1, Day 8): LA-EP2006: 3.3%; Neulasta EU: 8.1% 
Similar numbers of patients in the LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU treatment groups were observed with shifts from 
normal to abnormal values of hematological parameters. In study LA-EP06-301, differences > 4% were 
observed in hemoglobin, neutrophils, and monocytes. 
In study LA-EP06-302, differences > 4% were observed in hemoglobin, erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, and 
eosinophils. 
Clinical chemistry 
Numbers of patients in the SAF with clinically significant values in clinical chemistry parameters were similar 
between the treatment groups and small in either treatment group (≤ 2%) at any time point, and there were no 
considerable differences in absolute and relative changes from baseline between the treatment groups. Similar 
numbers of patients were observed with shifts to normal/abnormal values of clinical chemistry parameters.

Immunological events 
Healthy volunteers: 
In study LA-EP06-101, serum samples for the assessment of immunogenicity were collected at 15 minutes 
pre-dose on Day 1 and on Days 15 and 28. Subjects with a positive confirmatory result in the binding 
anti-pegfilgrastim antibody ELISA are summarized in Table 71. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected at any 
time point. 
Table 65: Immunogenicity in healthy volunteers - Study LA-EP06-101 (safety population) 
The general incidence of ADAs was low in in study -101. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. 
3 patients in the Neulasta EU group had positive ADA titers at baseline, compared to none in the biosimilar 
group. 5 patients (5,4%) developed ADA at day 15 in the biosimilar group out of which 2 remained positive till 
day 28, whereas only one patient (1,1%) remained positive in the Neulasta EU group. The small numerical 
difference of non neutralizing antibodies is not considered to be relevant. 
In study LA-EP06-103, blood samples for the assessment were collected during screening and, during each 
period, within 2 hours prior to dosing on Day 1, and on Days 15 and 28. At the study eligibility screening visit, 
35 subjects with a positive ADA screening assay result (result above the ADA screening assay cut-point) were 
not randomized in the study unless ADA positivity was excluded in a confirmatory assay. Two subjects which 
were tested positive for ADA at Day 28 (Period 1) were excluded from further participation as per protocol.  
One subject treated with LA-EP2006 was tested positive for filgrastim specific ADA (the overall test result was 
inconclusive as the subject was tested negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies) and another one treated with 
Neulasta was tested positive for combination of pegfilgrastim and PEG specific ADA).  None of the subjects 
developed Nabs.

IMP (Cycle 1, Day1), on Day 15 of Cycle 6, on the EOS visit 4 weeks after the last administration of the IMP, and 
– in case of early termination – on the Early Termination visit. In study LA-EP06-301, an additional sample was 
collected on the 6-month SFU visit.

In study LA-EP06-301, one patient treated with LA-EP2006 had combination positive antipegfilgrastim and 
anti-PEG antibody samples at EOS; as no pre-dose sample was taken, the immune status of the patient at the 
start of the study could not be evaluated. All samples were tested negative in the neutralizing antibody assay. 
Three patients in the LA-EP2006 treatment group had positive ADA binding at 6-month SFU: One patient had 
combination positive anti-pegfilgrastim and anti-PEG antibody samples at the 6-month SFU. This patient was 
already tested positive for anti-pegfilgrastim and anti-PEG antibody at Cycle 1, Day 1, i.e. at pre-dose. Two 
patients had anti-filgrastim positive samples at the 6-month SFU visit. One of the patients was also tested 
positive at EOT, but not at Cycle 1, Day 1 and EOS. The second patient was tested negative at all other time 
points. However, all three patients were tested negative for anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies at the respective 
visits. All samples were tested negative for neutralizing anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. 
In study LA-EP06-302, 1 patient in the Neulasta EU group was tested positive for antifilgrastim binding 
antibodies at all sampling time points. However, neutralizing antibody results of this patient were negative. One

patient in the LA-EP2006 treatment group had a positive neutralizing antibody result at Cycle 1, Day 1, i.e. at 
pre-dose The characterization of the ADA response in the binding assay had demonstrated that ADAs were 
targeted against pegfilgrastim and/ or PEG, but not filgrastim. All post-dose sampling time points of this patient 
were determined negative for binding ADA. All neutralizing antibody results of the other patients with confirmed 
positive results for ADA binding were negative.

No Adverse event leading to discontinuation occurred in healthy volunteers in study -101. In study -103, when 
classified by study site/stage 1 and 2, no subject at site 2 discontinued due to treatment emergent adverse 
events  (TEAEs), whereas at study site 1, 2 subjects discontinued due to TEAEs (arthralgia, following LA-EP2006 
and thrombocytopenia, after Neulasta administration). Both AEs were of mild severity and with suspected causal 
relationship to the study drug. In breast cancer patients discontinuations due to AEs happened sporadically in 
both treatment arms, after events which were mostly not considered related to the IMP. Of note two cases 
(0,6%) under LA-EP2006 treatment in the pooled analysis discontinued, after events of febrile neutropenia, vs 
0 under Neulasta treatment.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The studies investigating safety and immunogenicity of LA-EP2006 are the PK/PD studies LA-EP06-103 and 
LA-EP06-101, both in healthy subjects, and the efficacy and safety studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 in 
female patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  The number of subject exposed 
to study drug is considered sufficient to support safety assessment of LA-EP2006. 
Healthy volunteers 
The most common adverse events were back pain, bone pain, headache and myalgia. When analysed by period, 
the most common adverse events were bone pain, headache, myalgia, backpain and non-cardiac chest pain 
(period 1). There were no issues of clinical relevance with respect to clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECG 
recordings, local tolerability or immunogenicity (except for the PD effect on neutrophils). The immunogenicity 
evaluation confirmed the very low immunogenicity of pegfilgrastim. Overall, the majority of antibodies was 
detected pre-dose and directed against PEG; the presence of anti-PEG antibodies in normal subjects is known 
from the literature. A low anti-pegfilgrastim response was detected in a few healthy subjects (2.5%, equally 
distributed across treatment arms); none was neutralising. Both LA-EP2006 and Neulasta were equally tolerated 
as demonstrated by the pain severity at the injection site and the injection site reaction. There were some minor 
differences in TEAEs in study -101, gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, diarrhea) and unspecific pain were 
slightly more abundant in the LA-EP2006 group. Furthermore, in study -103, there was a slightly higher 
incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially back pain (42% versus 30%), arthralgia (13% versus 9 %) 
and, to a less clear extent, bone pain, neck pain, pain in extremity, muscle twitching, groin pain and muscle 
fatigue as well as general disorders and nervous system disorders, whereas a lower incidence for myalgia and 
musculoskeletal stiffness was observed for LA-EP2006( 55 versus 46% / 9 versus 16%). However, these 
differences are considered not clinically relevant. 
Breast Cancer Patients 
Studies LA-EP06-301 and LA-EP06-302 independently showed comparable safety results: The overall incidences 
and pattern of TEAEs were widely similar in the LA-EP2006 treatment groups compared with the Neulasta EU 
treatment groups in both studiesTEAEs with the highest incidences were typical chemotherapy induced events 
(alopecia, nausea, asthenia, and vomiting). The most frequently affected SOC (i.e. >10% of patients in either 
treatment group) in Pool 1 was “gastrointestinal disorders” (primarily nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), followed 
by “general disorders and administration site conditions” (primarily asthenia, fatigue and pyrexia), “skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders” (primarily alopecia), “blood and lymphatic system disorders” (primarily 
neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and febrile neutropenia), “musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders”, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 116/127 
  
  
“infections and infestations”, “nervous system disorders”, “metabolism and nutrition disorders”, “respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders”, and “investigations”. The remaining SOCs affected were reported by <10% 
of patients in either treatment group. Findings in the SAF-C set were similar to that of the SAF set. The most 
common treatment-related AEs were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (10,2% for LA-EP2006 vs 
9,7% in Neulasta EU). Incidences were in general similar.  
Most “prominent” (>1%) differences in TEAEs occured in the SOC Blood and lymphatic tissue disorders 
(16/5,1% vs10/3,2%) and where the incidence of the AE Neutropenia was about double the count for 
LA-EP2006 (4/1,3% vs 2/0,6%). However, these differences are not considered clinically relevant. 
Serious TEAEs with a suspected causal relationship to study drug as per investigator assessment occurred with 
a low incidence in both treatment groups.  
In absolute numbers, there were 7 deaths in LA-EP2006 treated patients and 4 deaths in Neulasta EU treated 
patients. One death case in the LA-EP2006 group had previously received commercial product. Most deaths 
were due to cardiovascular events or infections, and were likely related to severity of the chronic underlying 
diseases or concomitant chemotherapy.  
The general incidence of ADAs was low in healthy volunteers. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. The 
small numerical difference of non neutralizing antibodies is not considered to be relevant, especially when 
considering the observed PK overexposure of the biosimilar candidate. 
In breast cancer patients, the immunogenicity results evaluated by binding ADA and neutralizing antibody 
formation were similar in both treatment groups across both studies. In both treatment groups, varying 
amounts of patients tested positive for pegfilgrastim specific or peg specific ADAs. In the pooled data analysis 
from both studies, at baseline, 23 (7,3%) of patients were tested positive for pegfilgrastim specific antibodies in 
the biosimilar groups 29(9,4%) in the Neulasta EU group. 9,9% tested positive for PEG antibodies vs. 12,3 in the 
Neulasta EU group. The incidence antibodies present at baseline decreased or vanished during the treatment 
period. At end of study only one patient (0,7%) still tested positive for anti pegfilgrastim antibodies vs 0 in the 
Neulasta group.  
Therefore, the overall ADA incidence in breast cancer patients and healthy volunteers was low (higher at 
baseline, than end of study) and similar between treatments. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No  unexpected  safety  signals  were  observed  with  LA-EP2006  and  no  deaths  occurred  during  the  studies  in 
healthy volunteers and cancer patients that were considered related do the product. 
The safety of Ziextenzo was comparable with the safety of Neulasta and there were no clinically relevant 
differences observed. As to immunogenicity, no meaningful differences were observed across treatment 
sequences. Generally, the observed AEs were in line with the SmPC for Neulasta. Therefore, the safety data 
overall support the biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 and reference product EU-Neulasta.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The claimed indication is identical to the reference product Neulasta: “Reduction in the duration of neutropenia 
and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes)”. Clinical studies supporting 
the application were carried out in healthy volunteers and in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy as 
part of the biosimilarity exercise. The clinical programme of Ziextenzo comprises of 2 PK studies and 2 phase III 
studies.  
The claim of biosimilarity is based on the totality of the evidence including analytical, nonclinical and clinical 
data.  
The applicant has utilized a stepwise approach to develop LA-EP2006 as a biosimilar to Neulasta consistent with 
the recommended approach by European Medicines Agency (EMA) as noted in the Guidance documents and in 
line with feedback received during the development program.  
A comprehensive biosimilarity exercise was performed on the quality profile of the proposed biosimilar with its 
EU sourced reference medicinal product to characterise and compare relevant quality attributes of pegfilgrastim. 
This panel included analytical tests for physicochemical features as well as biological characteristics.  
In addition, a comparable quality profile of biosimilar material produced at the different stages of development 
and at the different manufacturing sites has been demonstrated.  
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
A similar quality profile between LA-EP2006 and reference medicinal product was demonstrated for the majority 
of physicochemical and biological quality attributes. Of note, a slightly improved purity profile for LA-EP2006 
was measured. This observed difference does however not preclude the biosimilarity claim. Furthermore, a 
comparable quality profile of biosimilar material produced at the different stages of development and at the 
different manufacturing sites has been established. 
Non-Clinical 
The submitted non-clinical dossier included relevant comparative in vitro studies where the results of the in vitro 
binding assay (SPR) show that binding of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta to the G-CSF receptor is highly similar 
(dissociation constants KD of 92 to 106 pM or 92 to 98 pM for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta, respectively). The results 
of the cell based bioassay, which also requires binding of the products to the G-CSF receptor on NFS-60 cells to 
initiate signalling pathways that lead to their proliferation, are considered highly similar: With potencies ranging 
from 96 to 103% and 95 to 104% for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta, respectively. Well-powered in vivo studies in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 123/127 
  
  
 
naïve and neutropenic animals did not indicate any relevant differences between Ziextenzo and Neulasta, 
supporting the claim of biosimilarity. 
Clinical: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
Results from study LA-EP06-103 demonstrate PK comparability, as all the 90% confidence intervals of the 
geometric mean ratio of all primary PK parameters (AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax) are entirely contained in the 
pre-specified [80-125%] interval. Point estimates and respective 90 % CIs for the ratios of the geometric means 
for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU were 1.14 [1.06 – 1.22] for AUC0-inf, 1.14 [1.06 – 1.23] for AUC0-last, 1.11 
[1.03 – 1.19] for Cmax. 
Biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 could be formally concluded to reference product Neulasta with respect to 
AUEC0→last of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in both PK/PD studies. For study LA-EP06-101, the point 
estimates as well as the 95%CI were well within the predefined acceptance range of 87-115%. AUEC0-last for 
LA-EP2006 vs. Neulasta EU: 100.75 [94.04-107.94]. For study LA-EP06-103, the point estimates as well as the 
95%CI fell within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%. AUEC0-last for LA-EP2006 vs. Neulasta EU was 
101.61 (99.96-103.30) (absolute values). PD similarity was also demonstrated for the maximum effect 
attributable to the study drug (Emax) of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC).  
Findings of both PK/PD trials seem consistent, as demonstrated by the concordance of the point estimates for 
the primary PK/PD endpoints.  
Consistent results were also demonstrated in both efficacy studies LA-EP06-301 and -302: PD similarity could be 
shown for both studies, using the proposed margin for the PK/PD studies (87% - 115%) for the area under the 
ANC effect curve (AUEC0-last) during Cycle 1. The latter study (-302) also demonstrated a higher exposure of the 
biosimilar candidate compared to reference in a subset of 60 patients (point estimates around 120% and the 
upper limits of the 90% CI lay around 180 % for AUC0-last and Cmax). 
Clinical: Efficacy 
The applicant has shown similarity in terms of efficacy in two confirmatory phase III trials of nearly identical 
design between the biosimilar candidate and Neulasta-EU across primary and secondary endpoints. The studies 
were adequately designed for a biosimilar exercise and the population included was appropriate. Both studies 
(and all treatment arms) presented comparable median values (1,00d) for the primary endpoint, duration of 
severe neutropenia. The 95% CI of the difference in DSN was easily preserved within the predefined equivalence 
margins of +/- 1d and consecutively within the more narrow NI margin (-0,6d) for both studies. Similarity for 
the primary measure was also shown in the pooled analysis across the two trials (-0.04 [-0.19, 0.11]). Not only 
was the duration of SN comparable but also its respective incidence and timing. Results of the secondary 
measures support results of the primary endpoint. 
Clinical: Safety 
The comparative safety results of the studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with breast cancer support 
biosimilarity of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta EU, as no major differences in the occurrence of unfavourable effects 
across studies were observed. 
The general incidence of ADAs was low in healthy volunteers. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. 
The small numerical difference of non-neutralizing antibodies was not considered to be relevant. 
In breast cancer patients, the immunogenicity results were similar in both treatment groups across both studies. 
No neutralizing antibodies were developed. No serious AEs were observed. The AEs described from the clinical 
trials with Ziextenzo are similar to those described in the SmPC for Neulasta.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of biosimilarity of 
Ziextenzo and Neulasta. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Comparability between material derived from the different development stages and manufacturing sites as well 
as similarity between the biosimilar candidate and its reference medicinal product was established. However, 
some data derived from the biosimilarity exercise indicate a slightly lower level of impurities for the biosimilar 
candidate, in particular lower levels of de-amidated variants, high molecular weight variants, di- and 
non-pegylated variants of filgrastim and acidic variants by CEX-HPLC have been measured for LA-EP2006. 
Within the initially submitted dossier, the applicant had thus analysed the potential impact of even slight 
differences in quality attributes in terms of their potential to affect PK. 
Summarizing the findings, LA-EP2006 contains less product-related variants than Neulasta. The biggest 
observed difference in deamidated variants cannot, however, explain the PK results, as these variants have full 
bioactivity. Three quality attributes with a potential impact on PK showed slight differences compared to 
Neulasta, namely levels of di-pegylated filgrastim, non-pegylated filgrastim and HMWV. The levels of 
di-pegylated filgrastim and non-pegylated filgrastim are demonstrably too low to explain the PK results. The 
slightly lower levels of HMWV in LA-EP2006 would support a lower PK, which is in contrast to the clinical results. 
The difference in PK results for LA-EP2006 and Neulasta in cannot be explained by differences in quality 
attributes. From a quality perspective, LA-EP2006 can be considered comparable to Neulasta. 
From the preclinical perspective, the results of the in vitro data and in vivo animal studies showed that 
LA-EP2006 and Neulasta are highly similar in terms of binding to the G-CSF receptor, potency as well as no 
relevant differences were observed between LA-EP2006 and Neulasta in naive and neutropenic rats. Based on 
these results it can be concluded that LA-EP2006 and Neulasta generate comparable effects and the non-clinical 
data support the claim of biosimilarity between the test and reference product. 
From a clinical view, the demonstration of biosimilarity at PK/PD level is the most important and sensitive step 
to confirm that the slight differences detected on analytical and non-clinical levels do not have impact on the 
clinical efficacy and safety. Overall, the results from study LA-EP06-103 demonstrated PK comparability. The PK 
differences in females and the observed overexposure of LA-EP2006 do not translate into altered PD, efficacy or 
immunogenicity. In addition, the occurrence of major unfavourable effects also seems to be balanced between 
treatments and the AEs captured in the comparative clinical studies are known AEs that are described in the 
SmPC for Neulasta.  
Overall, similarity has been convincingly demonstrated at the quality, non-clinical and clinical efficacy level. The 
observed PK differences are not considered clinically relevant and have no impact on the PD, efficacy or safety 
data. Therefore, considering the totality of the evidence on the quality, non-clinical and clinical data, 
biosimilarity of Ziexteno with the reference product EU Neulasta can be concluded. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The claimed indication is the only indication currently approved for EU-Neulasta (“Reduction in the duration of 
neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for 
malignancy [with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes”]).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/706001/2018 
Page 125/127 
  
  
Therefore no extrapolation to other indications is needed for this biosimilar application. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Ziextenzo is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Ziextenzo is favourable in the following indication: reduction in the duration of 
neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for 
malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).

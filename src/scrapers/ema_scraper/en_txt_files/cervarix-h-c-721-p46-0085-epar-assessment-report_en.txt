1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:  
Extension study of the primary vaccination study, study HPV-013 and subsequent follow-up study Ext 
HPV-013  designed  to  evaluate  the  long-term  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the  HPV-16/18  VLP  L1 
AS04 vaccine in pre-teen and adolescent females aged 10 to 14 years at the time of first vaccination, 
for  a  period  of  approximately  10  years  after  first  HPV  vaccination  in  the  primary  study  (study  HPV-
013). The current report presents the results of the interim analysis up to Month 108 (Year 9).

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 
This extension study of the primary vaccination study, study HPV-013 and subsequent follow-up study 
Ext HPV-013 was designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the HPV-16/18 VLP 
L1  AS04  vaccine  in  pre-teen  and  adolescent  females  aged  10  to  14  years  at  the  time  of  first 
vaccination,  for  a  period  of  approximately  10  years  after  first  HPV  vaccination  in  the  primary  study 
(study  HPV-  013).  The  current  report  presents  the  results  of  the  interim  analysis  up  to  Month  108 
(Year 9). No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary or secondary objectives. 
At Month 108, all subjects were still seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies. In the  ATP 
cohort, in subjects who were initially seronegative, GMTs at Month 108 were 1949.2 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1776.8 – 2138.5] for HPV-16 and 739.1 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 669.9 – 815.3] for HPV-18. 
The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titers in ATP baseline seronegative subjects were 4.66 and 3.05 fold 
higher, respectively, than the titers observed at an equivalent timepoint (i.e. Month 107 – Month 113 
during  the  plateau  phase)  in  female  subjects  aged 15-25  years  at the  time  of  enrolment  in  the  HPV-
001/007/023 study. 
The  HPV-16  and  HPV-18  antibody  titers  in  ATP  baseline  seronegative  subjects  were  65.41  and  32.56 
fold  higher,  respectively,  than  those  associated  with  natural  infection  found  in  subjects  aged  15-25 
years at the time of vaccination in study HPV-008. 
During the follow-up period from Month 96 to Month 108, 15 subjects reported 22 SAEs, none of which 
were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. No fatal SAEs were reported 
during the follow-up period from Month 96 to Month 108. 
In conclusion, the results from this interim analysis confirm the sustained immunogenicity of the HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine up to 108 months after administration of the first dose in subjects aged 10 
- 14 years at the time of first vaccination both in terms of anti-HPV-16/18 GMTs and seropositivity and 
with an acceptable safety profile. 
The  submission  of  the  final  analysis  at  month  120  to  fulfill  the  commitment  FUM.019  is  currently 
planned by December 2015. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The MAH Discussion is generally endorsed. The results of this annual update report were in agreement 
with previous annual reports. The results are in line with expectations. The MAH’s overall conclusions

are  endorsed  and  no  further  actions  are  required  for  this  PAM  at  Month  108.  No  further  regulatory 
action  is  considered  necessary  based  on  these  results.  The  final  results  of  this  study  are  expected  at 
month  120.  A  complete  safety  profile of  this  long  term  follow  up  is  expected  at  the  end  of  the  study 
including all subjects from the TVC that were originally selected for inclusion in HPV025 EXT-13. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Humira contains adalimumab, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the biological 
function of TNF. The product is currently approved for treatment of several conditions, e.g. rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), active ulcerative colitis (UC) and chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps). 
Humira is also approved for use in paediatrics in all of these indications, with the lowest age limit being 2 
years in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  
A variation application for an extension of the indication of Humira to adults with active moderate to 
severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) was approved on 28 July 2015 (procedure EMEA/H/C/481/II/137). 
The current application is a type II variation application to extend the indication for Humira also to the use 
in adolescents from 12 years of age with HS.  
HS is a serious, chronic, inflammatory skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents with painful, 
deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, such as the axillary, 
inguinal and anogenital regions. The disease is characterized by recurrent inflamed nodules and 
abscesses, which may rupture to form fistulas and ooze purulent drainage and lead to scarring. HS is 
associated with several complications like the development of anal, urethral and rectal strictures and 
fistulas. Scarring and fibrosis can lead to contractures and limitations in limb mobility. HS has a severely 
negative impact on quality of life, which is often worse compared to other skin diseases.  
Prevalence and similarities between HS in adolescents and adults 
Since no EU-based population sampling has been utilized to assess the prevalence of HS, data from a 
large insured administrative database in the US were used to determine the prevalence of HS in 2009 in 
the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) P/0121/2013 for the use of adalimumab in HS. The overall 
prevalence of HS was 0.19% (7,472 patients diagnosed with HS out of 3,950,936 patients continuously 
eligible in 2009).  The prevalence of HS in the paediatric population was found to be less than one-fifth of 
that in the adult population. The prevalence of HS in the adult population was 0.23% (7,162 adult 
patients diagnosed with HS out of 3,157,445 adult patients).  In comparison, the prevalence of HS in the 
paediatric population was 0.04% overall (310 paediatric patients diagnosed with HS out of 793,491 
paediatric patients). Of these patients, the prevalence among infants less than 2 years of age was 0.00%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 5/39 
 
 
 
 
 
the prevalence among prepubescent children between 2 and 11 years of age (inclusive) was 0.00% (12 
children diagnosed with HS out of 433,354 total children sampled), and the prevalence among 
adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age (inclusive) was 0.09% (298 adolescents diagnosed with HS 
out of 328,634 total adolescents sampled). 
A questionnaire-based survey of hospital-identified HS patients in the United Kingdom (UK) found the 
mean age of onset of HS to be 21.8 years, the mean duration from onset to maximal severity to be 6.4 
years, and that the severity of HS generally increases over several years. Onset of HS typically occurs in 
the second or third decade of life. The virtual absence of HS in children below the age of 12 suggests that 
hormonal factors and puberty may play an important role in its pathogenesis. 
There is virtually no literature available on adolescents with HS due to the rarity of the disease in this 
population; however, review of the available literature provides no suggestion that the key clinical 
features of HS are distinguishable in adolescents and adults.  One source indicates that HS in children and 
adolescents generally shares the same overall presentation of characteristic clinical features of HS 
observed in adults (i.e., inflammatory nodules, abscesses, draining fistulas, and scarring). In support of 
this assertion, in the approved EU adalimumab HS PIP, the EMA agreed with the extrapolation analyses 
from adults to adolescents with HS based on the similarity of HS disease in these populations. Therefore, 
it would appear that HS development in adolescence represents the same disease process seen in 
adulthood, similar to other inflammatory skin disorders that affect both adolescents and adults, such as 
chronic plaque Ps. The impact of HS on quality of life observed in adults (pain and discomfort from 
physical symptoms, social stigma, and long term psychological impact, including depression and anxiety) 
is profound and expected to also greatly impact adolescents with HS. 
There are no published case reports describing use of adalimumab in adolescent HS patients.  
Treatment options for moderate to severe HS in the paediatric population 
No therapeutic studies have been published in paediatric subjects with HS. As a consequence, current 
treatments are driven primarily by expert opinion, case reports, and/or extrapolation of treatments used 
in adult patients. Treatment of HS in this population depends largely on the extent and activity of disease, 
and possible endocrine co-morbidities and obesity should be considered in determining appropriate 
treatment.  
The primary aim of medical treatment in HS is to control inflammation and reduce symptoms, most 
notably pain.  Therapies used for HS include medical treatments (e.g., systemic combination therapy with 
clindamycin and rifampicin, intralesional triamcinolone, systemic cyclosporine, anti-androgen treatment 
in females, metformin, and systemic retinoids), surgical treatments (radical excision, marsupialization, 
and deroofing), and laser treatment (CO2 laser and Nd:YAG laser). Evaluation of the effectiveness of 
these interventions is difficult because efficacy has not been rigorously established using adequately sized 
controlled trials with validated instruments, or controlling for severity of disease. In addition, none of the 
medical treatments are approved for use in HS and several have the potential for major toxicities e.g. oral 
retinoids and anti-androgens.  
Surgical and laser treatment can be associated with significant post-procedure morbidities, including pain 
and scarring that may further restrict limb mobility, and a considerable percentage of these patients who 
undergo surgical or laser treatment for their HS experience persistent disease due to inadequate removal 
of involved tissue at the surgical site or due to the presence of disease at sites other than where surgery 
has been performed. 
Understanding of the pathogenesis of HS has progressed rapidly in the last several years.  The fact that 
adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, has proven efficacy in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 6/39 
 
 
 
 
treating adult HS confirms that TNF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease; however, 
treatment efficacy in adolescent patients with HS has not been tested.  Most experts believe that bacterial 
infection is a secondary event in the disease process, and that antibiotics do not cure the disease but may 
relieve symptoms through either an antibacterial or an anti-inflammatory effect.  
Until recently, the only published guidelines for the management of HS were national guidelines from 
Germany and the Netherlands, and there were no formal widely accepted treatment guidelines for HS 
either in the adult or the paediatric literature. However, treatment guidelines for HS were recently 
published in the EU. The guidelines concluded, "It is recommended that HS is treated based on the 
subjective impact and objective severity of the disease. Locally recurring lesions can be treated surgically, 
whereas medical treatment either as monotherapy or in combination with surgery is more appropriate for 
widely spread lesions. Medical therapy may include antibiotics and immunosuppressants." These 
guidelines also do not provide details specific to adolescents or children. 
In moderate to severe HS in adolescent and adult patients alike, a multifaceted approach may be 
adopted, where surgical therapy is used to remove the chronic components of HS which are not expected 
to respond to medical therapy (e.g., scarring, fistulas, and sinus tracts), and long-term systemic medical 
therapy is used to treat the acute or sub-chronic manifestations of HS (e.g., abscesses and inflammatory 
nodules). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment update is included in this application which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
In accordance with the CHMP guideline EMA Ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 entitled ‘Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human use’, proteins are exempted because 
they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Adalimumab (Humira) is a human 
anti-human TNFα monoclonal antibody (IgG1) - a composite of 100% human antibody sequences. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
No new clinical trials were submitted in support of this variation application. The clinical studies referred 
to have been previously evaluated in other submissions.  
Since the overall prevalence of HS is low (<1%) and the prevalence of HS in the paediatric population is 
even lower (less than one-fifth of that in the adult population), the conduct of clinical studies in paediatric 
HS patients was not considered feasible by the MAH. Hence, the present application is based on 
extrapolation, using PK-PD modelling and simulation.  
The application for the HS indication in adults was based on data from four studies (Studies M10-467, 
M11-810, M11-313, and M12-555). 
The extrapolation of the indication hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) from adult patients to adolescents is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 7/39 
 
 
 
 
based on: 
•  Determination of adalimumab exposure response relationship using population PK-PD modeling 
based on data from the initial double-blinded period of Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and 
M11-810) in adult HS patients. 
•  Use of the previously developed adalimumab paediatric population PK model (pJIA, ERA 
Enthesitis-related arthritis, paediatric Ps, and paediatric CD) to determine a dosing regimen in 
adolescent HS patients that will achieve serum adalimumab concentrations similar to those 
observed in adult HS patients. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population (Adolescents with HS) has not been studied. Instead the MAH 
has carried out a pooled population PK analysis to describe the dose-exposure relation in children and 
adolescents. 
Data from paediatric Ps (Study M04-717), JIA (Studies DE038 and M10-444), ERA (Study M11-328), and 
paediatric CD (Study M06-806) were used to develop the paediatric population PK model. Data from all 
subjects (age 2 – 18 years) enrolled into the 5 paediatric studies that received adalimumab and had at 
least one adalimumab concentration above the lower limit of quantitation were included in the population 
PK analysis (N = 524). 
The final paediatric population PK model was a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination, combined additive and proportional residual error model, and exponential inter-individual 
variability terms on CL/F and V2/F. The stepwise forward selection backward elimination covariate 
selection process resulted in AAA status, BSA, baseline albumin, and methotrexate co-administration as 
significant covariates on adalimumab CL/F and BSA as a significant covariate on adalimumab V2/F. The 
final model parameter estimates are presented in the table below.

Simulation of adalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients 
The final paediatric population PK model was used to simulate serum adalimumab exposure in adolescent 
HS subjects. Before conducting the PK simulations, subject demographics (weight, BSA, age, albumin) for 
adolescent HS subjects were extrapolated based on data from adolescent Ps subjects (Study M04-717). 
Baseline albumin levels and BSA distribution in adolescent HS subjects were assumed to be similar to 
those observed in adolescent Ps subjects enrolled in Study M04-717 (Median [range]: Albumin: 4.8 g/dL 
[3.9 – 5.4 g/dL], BSA: 1.68 [1.29 – 2.29]). This assumption was based on the observation of similar 
distribution of albumin and BSA between adult Ps and HS subjects in the Phase 3 studies. A 6.5% AAA+ 
rate was assumed for adolescent HS subjects similar to that observed in adult HS subjects receiving at 
least one dose of adalimumab in Phase 3 trials. Although methotrexate use was a significant covariate on 
adalimumab CL/F in the final paediatric population PK model, the effect of its co-administration was not 
included in the adolescent HS simulations since it is not an approved treatment for HS and was not used 
in the adult HS Phase 3 trials. A dataset including 458 virtual adolescent HS subjects was created (similar 
number of subjects to adult PK dataset) and 100 replicates were simulated in NONMEM for a total number 
of simulated subjects of 45,800. A weight-based dose of 0.8 mg/kg eow was first simulated similar to the 
approved dose in paediatric Ps subjects. Given the expected weight range for adolescent HS subjects (≥ 
35 kg) based on observed weight distribution in adolescent Ps subjects (38 – 108 kg), a 40 mg eow fixed 
dose for all subjects was also simulated and results were compared to those obtained after 0.8 mg/kg eow 
dosing. 
Simulated adalimumab concentrations in adolescent HS subjects (summarized as median and 90% 
prediction interval) were compared to those observed in adults in Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and 
M11-810) to determine a dosing regimen for adolescent subjects that would achieve serum 
concentrations similar to those observed in adults. The result is shown in the figure below. 
Figure 1.  Simulated adalimumab concentrations in adolescent HS subjects (summarized as median and 
90% prediction interval) were compared to those observed in adults in Phase 3 studies (Studies 
M11-313 and M11-810) 
To address the CHMP comment on the appropriateness of the use of the paediatric Ps population 
demographics for adolescent HS in the PK extrapolations, the MAH compared the body weight (BW) of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 9/39 
 
 
 
 
 
adult subjects in the two disease population (HS and Ps) across different age groups enrolled in the Phase 
3 studies (Studies M11-313 and M11-810 for adult HS and Study M03-656 for adult Ps) and also between 
the adolescent HS subjects (12 – 17 years) from the ongoing HS Disease Based Registry and adolescent 
Ps subjects (12 – 17 years) in Study M04-717. 
As shown in Figure below, BWs are comparable between adult HS and adult Ps subjects across different 
age groups.  The BW of subjects in the two disease populations was also comparable in the younger adult 
subjects (18 – 19 years) in both populations, suggesting that the BW of the two populations would be 
expected to be generally comparable in the adolescent age group. 
Figure 2.  Comparison of Body Weight between Adult HS (Studies M11-313 and M11-810) and Adult Ps 
Subjects (Study M03-656) 
In 62 adolescent HS patients (12 – 17 years) from the ongoing HS Disease Based Registry (H13 – 147), 
the median (range) BW was 75 kg (42 – 145 kg), which is higher than the observed weight distribution in 
adolescent Ps subjects (12 – 17 years) in Study M04-717 (60 kg [38 – 108 kg]).  However, a difference 
of 15 kg in the median BW between the two populations would result in only a small increase of 
approximately 12% in the predicted median adalimumab clearance values in adolescent HS patients.  
These data suggest that the plasma exposure in adolescent HS patients is expected to be similar to those 
obtained by extrapolation from the adolescent Ps population. 
As part of the application, the CHMP also raised a concern regarding the proposed posology. Indeed, the 
Applicant proposed a different posology in HS patients 12 to 18 years of age compared to the adult 
patients. A maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week was suggested instead of the adult 40 mg every 
week regimen. Further, the adult induction dose regimen (adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at 
Week 2) was not included in the suggested posology for adolescents.  
A similar posology as in several other paediatric indications, in which no loading dose is recommended, 
was proposed by the MAH. However, in Crohn´s disease (which has a similarly intense dosing schedule at 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 10/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initiation of therapy as for HS in adults), loading dose regimens are recommended both in paediatric 
patients and in adults. 
In the CHMP’s opinion, there was an obvious risk of underdosing with the proposed regimen. Indeed, the 
dose proposed is a flat dose (40 mg for all patients) and it is expected that the weight range can be rather 
wide in the intended age range 12-17 years. Based on this, there is a concern that particularly patients in 
the upper age range (16-17 years), especially those who are obese, will achieve a too low exposure with 
the proposed posology.  
Based on the concerns raised by the CHMP, the Applicant has proposed a revised proposal for dosing of 
Humira in adolescent HS subjects together with the following justifications:  
Induction Dose Evaluation 
The proposed posology included a dosing regimen of 40 mg every other week (eow) with the first two 
doses given weekly, to try to achieve steady state concentrations early in treatment.  Based on concerns 
raised by CHMP, the MAH has further evaluated the use of a higher induction dose at Week 0, followed by 
the proposed maintenance dose of 40 mg eow in adolescent HS patients starting at Week 1 as shown in 
Figure below (left panel).  The use of an induction dose of 80 mg at Week 0 helps achieve adalimumab 
steady-state concentrations more rapidly compared with a 40 mg induction dose.  The simulated (median 
and 90% prediction interval) steady-state concentrations after an induction dose of 80 mg followed by 40 
mg eow starting at Week 1 in adolescent HS subjects were similar to the adalimumab concentrations 
observed in adult HS subjects in Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and M10-810) and were slightly higher 
when compared to the originally proposed induction dose of 40 mg at Week 0.  These results demonstrate 
that the use of an induction dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 is an appropriate 
dosing regimen to achieve similar steady-state concentrations in adolescent HS subjects in a similar time 
frame to those observed in adult HS subjects, especially at earlier time points. 
The use of a maintenance dose of 40 mg every week (ew) in adolescent subjects were predicted to result 
in higher adalimumab concentrations in adolescent HS subjects compared to those observed in adult HS 
subjects (Figure below, right panel).  The use of a higher loading dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at 
Week 2 followed by 40 mg ew starting at Week 4 (similar to the dose regimen approved in adult HS 
subjects) would similarly result in overexposure in adolescent HS subjects when compared to adult and is 
not regarded as an appropriate dose in adolescents with HS.

The blue dashed lines represent the median and 95% confidence interval of observed adalimumab concentrations in adult 
HS subjects in Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and M11-810).  Black solid line and grey shaded area represent the 
median and 95% prediction interval for simulated concentrations in adolescent HS subjects following an induction dose of 
160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg ew starting at Week 4.  Green dashed lines represent the median and 95% 
prediction interval for simulated concentrations in adolescent HS subjects following an induction dose of 40 mg SC at 
Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1. 
The simulated serum adalimumab concentrations following an induction dose of 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 
mg eow starting at Week 1 in adolescent HS subjects were subsequently used together with the 
population PK/PD model to simulate HiSCR response rate in adolescent HS subjects for the 80 mg 
induction dose regimen and compared with those predicted under the originally proposed 40 mg induction 
dose regimen and observed HiSCR response rates in adult HS subjects.  As shown in the figure below, the 
predicted HiSCR response rate in adolescents under the 80 mg induction dose regimen was similar to the 
overall response rate observed in Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and M11-810) in adult subjects, 
especially at Week 2.  The use of an induction dose of 80 mg is expected to achieve a higher HiSCR 
response rate in adolescent HS subjects earlier when compared to the induction dose of 40 mg, consistent 
with the PK differences observed with the two dosing regimens at earlier time points.  The simulated 
HiSCR rate in adolescent HS subjects further confirms the appropriateness of the use of an induction dose 
of 80 mg along with the proposed maintenance regimen of 40 mg eow starting at Week 1.

Supporting Data for 30 kg Lower Weight Limit 
The lowest weight observed in adolescent HS patients from the ongoing HS Disease Based Registry 
(Study H13-147) was 42 kg.  In addition, there was only 1 subject with BW below 40 kg among the 
adolescent Ps subjects (12 – 17 years) in the Paediatric Ps Study M04-717 (BW of 38 kg).  Based on these

data, the epidemiology of HS, and the general understanding that HS most commonly develops in 
patients in their early 20s, it appears very unlikely that an HS subject would weigh less than 30 kg.  
Therefore, the MAH proposed as part of the application a lower weight limit of 30 kg for use of 
adalimumab in adolescent HS subjects.  Providing simple dosing instructions reduces label complexity 
and potential for dosing errors. 
It is also important to ensure that the adolescent HS patients weighing 30 – 40 kg are not overexposed 
under the proposed dose of 40 mg eow.  Due to the limited availability of demographic information in 
adolescent Ps subjects in Study M04-717 weighing < 40 kg (only one subject), use of the population PK 
model to predict adalimumab concentrations for subjects 12 – 17 years of age weighing 30 – 40 kg will 
have limited confidence.  Therefore, the MAH has utilized the demographic data from paediatric Ps 
subjects (below 12 years of age) from Study M04-717 to estimate the predicted adalimumab exposures 
in subjects in the weight range of 30 – 40 kg who would receive 40 mg eow under the proposed dosing 
regimen. 
The median (95% Prediction Interval) for the simulated serum trough concentrations in subjects with BW 
of 30 – 40 kg was predicted to be 8.02 µg/mL (0.19 – 24.9 µg/mL).  These values are comparable to the 
adalimumab exposures expected in adolescent HS subjects with BW > 40 kg and are within the 
concentration range observed in other studies with adalimumab in paediatric populations, including 
paediatric Crohn's disease (CD), paediatric Ps, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). 
The use of the proposed dosing regimen in adolescent HS subjects weighing 30 – 40 kg is further 
supported by the data showing that there is no apparent relationship between adalimumab 
concentrations and adverse event (AE) rates in paediatric patients with Ps (Study M04-717), JIA (Studies 
M10-444, M11-328 and DE038), and CD (Study M06-806), as shown in the figure below.

Concern for Underdosing in Older Adolescent HS Subjects 
The MAH further evaluated the appropriateness of the proposed dose of 40 mg eow for all patients (≥ 30 
kg) by comparing the predicted adalimumab steady state concentrations in adolescent HS subjects across 
different BW ranges.  Body weight ranges were selected for this analysis, since body weight is a better 
predictor of adalimumab pharmacokinetics than age.  The predicted adalimumab steady-state 
concentrations in adolescent HS subjects were also compared to those observed in adult HS subjects in 
the Phase 3 studies (Studies M11-313 and M11-810). 
In addition, PK simulations were performed for an increase in dosing frequency for patients with a BW ≥ 
90 kg to address the concern of potential low exposures in the upper age/weight range.  This upper 
weight cut-off was selected based on the observed median BW in adult HS subjects in the Phase 3 studies 
(93 kg).  In addition, a BW cut-off of 90 kg allowed for the evaluation of predicted adalimumab 
concentrations in the heaviest patients to address the concern that older, heavier patients are more likely 
to be under-dosed.  Under this potential dosing regimen, patients with BW in the range of 30 – < 90 kg 
would receive an induction dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 and 
patients weighing ≥ 90 kg would receive an induction dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg ew 
starting at Week 1 (similar to the maintenance dose approved in adult HS subjects). 
As shown in the Figure below, the predicted adalimumab steady state trough concentrations were 
comparable across all BW bins in adolescent HS subjects following the proposed dosing regimen of 80 mg 
at Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1.  The predicted concentrations of adalimumab following the 
40 mg eow dosing regimen in adolescent HS subjects were also comparable to those observed in adult HS 
subjects in the respective weight groups with the exception of the subjects in the lowest BW bin (≤ 38 – 
< 60 kg); however, the sample size in adult HS subjects in this weight range was small (N = 8).  These 
results demonstrate the appropriateness of the flat dosing regimen of 40 mg eow for all adolescent HS 
patients and that the risk of underdosing is unlikely with this proposed regimen across all weight groups. 
The use of a more frequent dosing regimen of 40 mg ew in adolescent HS patients weighing ≥ 90 kg would 
result in higher exposures in these patients when compared to the use of 40 mg eow dosing in these 
patients.  The predicted concentrations in the adolescent HS patients weighing ≥ 90 kg would also be

higher than those observed in adult subjects in the same weight group (Figure below, purple bar for 
patients weighing ≥ 90 kg).  Based on these results, the more frequent dosing regimen of 40 mg ew 
would be predicted to result in similarly higher exposures in patients across all the weight ranges.

Dosing Regimens Compared to Observed Concentrations in Adult HS Subjects by Body Weight

Note: 
Data represent predicted adalimumab steady state trough concentrations in adolescent HS subjects following 40 mg at 
Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 (blue bar), 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 (orange bar), 80 
mg at Week 0 and 40 mg eow (for patients < 90 kg) or 40 mg ew (for patients ≥ 90 kg) starting at Week 1 (purple bar), and 
observed adalimumab steady state trough concentrations in adult HS subjects in Phase 3 Studies M11-313 and M11-810 
receiving 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg ew starting at Week 4 (green bar). 
To further confirm the appropriateness of the proposed dose of 40 mg eow for all patients (≥ 30 kg), the 
MAH compared the predicted HiSCR response rates in adolescent HS subjects across different BW bins 
following the different dosing regimens.  As shown in the figure below, the predicted HiSCR response 
rates were comparable across the different BW bins in adolescent HS subjects following an induction dose 
of 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1, and were also comparable to those observed in 
adult HS subjects (who received 40 mg ew) in the respective weight groups.  The use of a more frequent 
dosing regimen of 40 mg ew in adolescent HS patients weighing ≥ 90 kg is predicted to result in modest 
improvement in efficacy in these patients when compared to the use of 40 mg eow dosing (Figure below, 
purple bar for patients ≥ 90 kg).

starting at Week 1 (blue bar), 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 (orange bar), 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 
mg eow (for patients < 90 kg) or 40 mg ew (for patients ≥ 90 kg) starting at Week 1 (purple bar), and observed HiSCR 
response rates in adult HS subjects in Phase 3 Studies M11-313 and M11-810 receiving 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 
mg at Week 2, and 40 mg ew starting at Week 4 (green bar). 
The HiSCR response rates in Studies M11-313 and M11-810 represent the primary efficacy endpoints in adult HS 
subjects in the Phase 3 Studies. 
Based on these results, the MAH considers that the proposed flat dose regimen of 80 mg at Week 0 
followed by 40 mg eow starting at Week 1 is an appropriate dosing regimen for the overall adolescent HS 
population. 
In addition, the MAH acknowledges that patients mature at different rates/ages and that certain 
adolescent patients may be more similar to adults in their handling of adalimumab and associated 
benefit:risk balance.  Considering that 40 mg ew dosing has demonstrated clinically important 
advantages when compared with 40 mg eow dosing for the treatment of HS in adults, the MAH proposed 
the option to increase dosing to 40 mg ew in patients not responding adequately to Humira 40 mg eow.

The proposed addition to the posology of a 40 mg ew dosing regimen in adolescent HS patients with 
inadequate response to treatment with 40 mg eow dosing is supported by safety data in paediatric 
patients with CD that support the approved option in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
to increase maintenance dosing frequency to 40 mg ew in paediatric patients with severe CD weighing ≥ 
40 kg who experienced insufficient response to the recommended 40 mg eow dosing regimen. 
This option to increase dosing frequency in paediatric CD patients was approved based on the results of 
Study M06-806, a multi-center, randomized, DB, safety, efficacy, and PK study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy of 2 adalimumab dosage regimens in the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in 
paediatric subjects with moderate to severe CD between the ages of 6 and 17 inclusive. 
It should be noted that at least 60% of all subjects in this study population used concomitant 
immunosuppressant (IMM) medications (azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate 
[MTX]) during the study (Study M06-806; table below), and that these medications affect the safety 
profile of adalimumab in this study, as reflected by an increase in the overall proportion of subjects 
experiencing AEs compared to studies in other paediatric indications. 
In Study M06-806, after receiving open-label (OL) induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline 
BW, all subjects were randomized by their BW at Week 4 to either the Low-Dose or High-Dose eow DB 
maintenance regimens, as shown below.

Subjects who received DB ew dosing were also evaluated from a safety standpoint.  Although the number 
of study subjects receiving 40 or 20 mg ew dosing was relatively small compared to the number receiving 
40 or 20 mg eow dosing, overall safety profiles, as represented by the proportion of subjects with AEs, 
were similar between dosing regimens.  An increased incidence of severe AEs and serious AEs 
(SAEs)/100 PYs in subjects receiving adalimumab ew versus eow dosing was mainly due to a higher 
number of CD (flare or worsening) events reported as a severe AE or SAE.  It should be noted that no 
SAEs at least possibly related to adalimumab were reported in subjects receiving ew dosing and that the 
incidence of AEs at least possibly related to adalimumab was very similar between subjects receiving ew 
or eow dosing.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Serum adalimumab concentrations and Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) response 
rates from Period A of the Phase 3 Studies M11-313 and M11-810 were used to develop a continuous time 
Markov Chain PKPD model for adalimumab in adult HS subjects. In addition, adalimumab 
exposure-response relationship during the first 12 weeks of treatment in the OLE Study M12-555 was 
evaluated using serum adalimumab concentrations and HiSCR response rates. 
Individual PK parameters were generated from the previously developed population PK model (Studies 
M10-467, M11-313, and M11-810) and were then applied as the input functions of the PD model to 
describe the relationship between adalimumab exposure and efficacy. A continuous time Markov Chain 
modeling approach was employed to describe the time course of adalimumab concentration effect on 
achievement of HiSCR. The schematic of the model is shown in the figure below.

[NB the parameter names in the model schematic are different from the parameter names used in tables and text; K01 
corresponds to P01 in the model schematic, etc.] 
The transition states of the Markov chain were defined as: No Response = State 0, Achieving HiSCR = State 1, and 
Dropout = State D. 
Baseline Sartorius score was found to influence the rate of transition from HiSCR non-responder to 
responder status. Higher baseline Sartorius scores resulted in a lower rate of transition and hence a lower 
probability of achieving HiSCR. This effect was independent of adalimumab treatment and affected both 
treatment arms equally. No significant covariates were identified on the drug effect parameter [PREF, 
“Drug effect” and capital greek letter theta 1 used interchangeably]. The functional form of the covariate 
effects on the K01 parameter is shown below

The ability of the model to describe the percentage of HiSCR response and dropout over time was 
evaluated by use of Visual Predictive Check, VPC (see below). Although the model slightly underpredicted 
the HiSCR response rate at Week 2, it accurately predicted HiSCR response rates for all subsequent study 
visits.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical studies in adolescents with HS have not been performed and no data is available on the efficacy, 
safety or exposure in this population. In order to extrapolate the efficacy of adalimumab from the source 
population (adult HS) to the target population (adolescent HS) it is assumed that the relation between 
dose, exposure and response is similar in adults and adolescents. 
The exposure to adalimumab in adolescent HS patients has not been determined. PK data obtained in 
children and adolescents in other indications (pJIA, ERA, paediatric Ps, and paediatric CD) has been 
integrated in a population PK model. The drug disposition (distribution and elimination) is not different 
between indications according to the model. The influential factors are anti-drug antibodies (AAA), body 
size, serum albumin level and concomitant methotrexate treatment. With respect to adolescent HS 
patients, the model does not provide any reason to expect different exposure compared to other 
paediatric indications. Thus, the pooled paediatric PK model is adequate for the purpose of simulation of 
exposure in adolescents with HS. 
Efficacy and exposure data are available from clinical studies in adult HS patients. These data have been 
integrated in an exposure-response model which used to simulate the response to a different posology in 
adolescents. Since only one dose level was studied in the adult patients, the modelled exposure-response 
needs to be interpreted with caution due to the risk of confounding factors.  
It should be noted that the main support /arguments in this application are based on the fact that the new 
target population is fairly similar to the adult population and that the plasma adalimumab exposure 
seems to be reasonably well matched to the adult exposure in HS. The modelling approach is appreciated 
and valuable as supportive evidence for extrapolation. 
Adolescent psoriasis vs. adolescent HS patients for PK extrapolations 
In adults, psoriasis and HS patients had rather similar body weights across different age groups. In 
adolescents, HS patients tended to have higher body weights compared with psoriasis patients, based on 
a HS Disease based registry. A 15 kg body weight difference was expected to result in an approximately 
12% higher CL of adalimumab in adolescent HS patients, which may not be of large relevance for the 
overall conclusions.  
As part of the application, the CHMP raised a concern regarding the proposed posology. In the CHMP’s 
opinion, there was an obvious risk of underdosing with the proposed regimen. Based on the concerns 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/676652/2016  
Page 21/39 
 
 
 
 
 
raised by the CHMP, the Applicant has proposed a revised proposal for dosing of Humira in adolescent HS 
subjects together with a justification; the CHMP assessment is as follows:  
Induction dose evaluation 
The lack of a loading dose (LD) regimen in adolescent HS patients as compared to adult HS patients was 
questioned by the CHMP. In the response, the Applicant has provided simulations of different regimens, 
with and without an LD, with a similar LD regimen as in adults (160 mg + 80 mg) and with an every other 
week (eow) vs. every week (ew) maintenance dose regimen. Based on these simulations, an LD regimen 
with an 80 mg dose was found the best match the adult exposure, as observed in the pivotal adult HS 
studies. 
With the dose regimen approved in adults (160 mg week 0, 80 mg week 2 and 40 mg ew from week 4), 
adolescent HS patients were predicted to achieve higher adalimumab concentrations compared with 
adults. Similarly, an every week (ew) maintenance dose regimen was predicted to result in higher 
exposure compared with adults. 
Based on the simulations, using exactly the same dosing regimen in adolescent HS patients as in adult HS 
patients was claimed to result in overexposure in the overall adolescent group (12-18 years). However, 
within this group, there can be large differences between a 12-year old and a 17-year old patient, for 
instance in body weight. There may also be young HS patients (12-13 years) with a high body weight. 
Nevertheless, a more cautious initiation of therapy (LD 80 mg instead of 160 mg + 80 mg) may be 
sensible in adolescents, but with a possibility to increase the maintenance dose to the adult 40 mg ew 
dose, if needed.  
Lower weight limit cut-off of 30 kg 
It was considered adequate to include a lower weight limit in the posology and a cut-off of 30 kg has been 
suggested by the Applicant. Indeed, providing simple dosing instructions reduces label complexity and 
potential for dosing errors. It is agreed that it seems unlikely that an HS subject would weigh less than 30 
kg. From predictions based on paediatric psoriasis patients, it seems unlikely that HS patients in the 
weight range 30-40 kg would be at risk of achieving too high exposures.  
Concern for underdosing in older adolescent HS subjects 
Considering the risk of underdosing, the Applicant has also introduced a statement that the dose may be 
increased from 40 mg eow to 40 mg ew in case of insufficient response in older adolescent HS subjects. 
This proposal was supported by different simulations of adalimumab concentrations across different 
weight spans. It is difficult to understand why the predicted exposure in adolescent HS subjects changes 
only minimally across weight categories, while the exposure in adult HS subjects is more clearly related 
to body weight. Based on the simulations, the Applicant does not propose an adult posology in all “old” 
adolescent HS patients, but has introduced the possibility to increase the dose to the adult maintenance 
dose (40 mg ew) in case of insufficient response. Use of a 40 mg ew regimen in adolescents has some 
support from use in paediatric Crohn´s disease, albeit with limited data from clinical trials. It is, however, 
agreed that there is precedent to allow patients with insufficient response to 40 mg eow to increase 
dosing to 40 mg ew, e.g. in adult patients with RA and Ps and paediatric patients with CD.  It is also 
agreed that any obvious relationship between adalimumab dose or exposure with safety has not been 
observed.  A somewhat higher incidence of severe AEs and SAEs/100 PYs in subjects receiving 
adalimumab ew versus eow dosing was observed, but was mainly due to a higher number of CD flares or 
worsening events. Hence, the proposed possibility to increase the dose is endorsed by the CHMP.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
As a result of the CHMP’s assessment, the MAH has updated the proposed posology for adolescent HS 
subjects as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Introduction of a weight limit for adolescents from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg 
Introduction of a dose of 80 mg at Week 0 
Possibility to increase the dosing frequency to 40 mg every week in adolescent patients with 
inadequate response to 40 mg eow 
The revised dosing regimen is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
As mentioned above, no new clinical trials were submitted to support the extension of the indication to 
include adolescents with HS. The application is based on modelling and simulation, with extrapolation of 
efficacy and safety of adalimumab from adults with HS and extrapolation of PK data from other paediatric 
indications for adalimumab to adolescents with HS. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No information about dose response of adalimumab in adolescents with HS is available. The proposed 
dose is based on modelling and simulation, described and assessed in the Clinical Pharmacology section. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
No studies with adalimumab in adolescents with HS are available. The approval of the HS indication in 
adults was based on data from four studies, of which Studies M11-810 and M11-313 were pivotal. These 
were both multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period studies with the aim to 
determine the clinical safety and efficacy of adalimumab compared to placebo in subjects with moderate 
to severe HS.  
Both studies included an initial 12-week double-blind treatment period and a subsequent 24-week 
double-blind treatment period. In both studies, a loading dose regimen was used, with adalimumab 
160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 followed by 40 mg ew or matching placebo starting at Week 4. In the 
second part of the studies, subjects in the adalimumab arm were re-randomized to receive adalimumab 
40 mg ew (i.e. continue with 40 mg ew treatment), adalimumab 40 mg eow (i.e. reduced dosing 
frequency) or matching placebo (i.e. withdrawal of active treatment). The primary end-point in both 
studies was the “Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response”, HiSCR, developed by the applicant. HiSCR 
is defined as at least a 50% reduction in the AN (abscess and inflammatory nodule) count with no increase 
in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count, at Week 12 relative to baseline.  
The main results of the HS studies in adults are summarized in the table below, for reference.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The application for Humira in the adults HS indication was supported by two adequately designed and 
performed phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe HS. Both studies met the primary efficacy 
end-point (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response, HiSCR), albeit with different size of the effect vs. 
placebo (42% and 59%, respectively, for HiSCR at week 12 vs. 26-27% for placebo). For the three, 
ranked secondary end-points, only one study (M11-810) met all these endpoints. In contrast, none of

these end-points achieved statistical significance in the second study (M11-313), although most 
outcomes were numerically in favour of adalimumab ew. Other secondary end-points in both studies 
generally mirrored the results of the primary and ranked secondary end-points. Outcomes related to 
patient-reported Quality of Life showed an effect of adalimumab vs. placebo, e.g. for DLQI. 
Thus, it was concluded that the efficacy of adalimumab in adults with moderate to severe HS was deemed 
clinically relevant, including positive outcomes related to patient-reported QoL. The indication approved 
in adults is a second line indication, in patients with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS 
therapy. A second line indication is presently applied for adolescents.  
No new clinical trials were submitted to support the extension of the indication to include adolescents with 
HS. The application is based on modelling and simulation, with extrapolation of efficacy and safety of 
adalimumab from adults with HS and extrapolation of PK data from other paediatric indications for 
adalimumab to adolescents with HS. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of PK and PKPD modelling to extend the adult HS indication to adolescents is considered the best 
option available considering the very low prevalence of HS in adolescents and is also in accordance with 
the PIP for Humira in HS. Even if the condition is rare, in particular in the adolescent group, it does exist 
in adolescents and well-studied treatments are overall few in HS. Hence, the CHMP endorsed from an 
efficacy perspective the indication in HS for adolescents. 
2.5.  Clinical safety  
No clinical data are available on the use of Humira in adolescents with HS. In the assessment of the adults 
HS indication, it was concluded that the safety profile of adalimumab in HS did not appear different from 
what that previously observed with adalimumab in other indications, except for rather frequent reporting 
of hidradenitis as an AE. The rate or severity of infections, including SSTIs, with Humira in HS did not give 
cause for concern in comparison with the experience in other indications. For AESI other than infections, 
no new or unexpected findings were overall observed in the HS studies; however, several events of 
worsening/new onset psoriasis were reported. Serious AEs were reported in 11% of subjects (e.g. 
anemia, cellulitis, ectopic pregnancy, hidradenitis, non-cardiac chest pain, palpitations, pilonidal cyst, 
pneumonia, postoperative wound infection, sepsis). Two deaths on adalimumab were reported in the HS 
clinical studies; none of which were considered related to adalimumab.  
Adalimumab has a well-established safety profile based on clinical trial and post-marketing data gained in 
multiple indications for more than 10 years.  As of 31 December 2015, adalimumab has been evaluated 
in more than 33,000 subjects in clinical trials. The estimated cumulative post-marketing patient exposure 
since the international birth date (31 December 2002) through 31 December 2015 is approximately 
4.3 million patient years. 
In the EU, adalimumab is approved for the treatment of paediatric patients with pJIA (> 2 years), ERA 
(≥6 years), CD (≥6 years), and Ps (>4 years). The incidence of treatment emergent AESI is similar across 
these paediatric indications. In addition, the safety profile across these paediatric indications is similar or 
consistent with the expected rates due to underlying disease and has not revealed any new safety signals 
compared with adults. 
To comply with the US FDA's post-marketing requirement for TNF-α blockers, the MAH performs 
enhanced safety surveillance for reports of malignancy in paediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients 
(≤30 years of age). Cumulative malignancy data in paediatric patients treated with adalimumab for 
varying diseases also do not reveal any new signals in the paediatric patient population.

As discussed previously, the CHMP was of the opinion that a posology for adolescents more in line with the 
adult HS posology seems more adequate.  Based on that, the MAH was asked to provide and discuss 
available safety data for adalimumab when a loading dose regimen is used in paediatric patients, e.g. 
based on data from Crohn's disease for which a loading dose is applied also in paediatric patients. 
The MAH proposed to update the recommended posology for adolescent HS patients (from 12 years of 
age and weighing at least 30 kg) to include an 80 mg induction dose at Week 0, followed by a 40 mg eow 
maintenance dosing regimen starting at Week 1. 
The proposed induction dosing regimen for the adolescent HS indication is supported by safety data in 
paediatric CD subjects from 6 years of age in which similar or higher induction doses were used (Study 
M06-806).  The approved recommended dosing regimen for the paediatric CD indication is based on this 
safety data. 
The recommended induction dosing regimen for paediatric CD subjects weighing < 40 kg is 40 mg at 
Week 0 followed by 20 mg at Week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the 
regimen of 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 can be used.  The typical recommended induction dose 
regimen for paediatric subjects ≥ 40 kg with moderately to severely active CD is 80 mg at Week 0 
followed by 40 mg at Week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 
of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 has also been approved for treatment. 
The paediatric CD dosing regimen, including induction dosing, was approved based on the results of 
Study M06-806.  In Study M06-806, all subjects received OL induction therapy at a dose based on their 
Baseline BW:  160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects weighing ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 
mg, respectively, for subjects weighing < 40 kg. 
With regard to AEs in this study, in general, proportions of subjects reporting AEs in the 2 induction 
dosing groups were similar (Table below).

Since the dose regimens including an 80 mg or 160 mg induction dose at Week 0 were generally well 
tolerated, and since the higher induction dose is used on Day 1 in the approved adult HS indication, it 
would follow that the 80 mg induction dose would be appropriate from a safety standpoint as proposed for 
the adolescent HS indication. 
Moreover, the use of an induction dose regimen in adolescent HS subjects is also supported by 
exposure-safety analyses during the induction phase of paediatric CD Study M06-806.  As shown in 
Figure below, there is no apparent relationship between adalimumab concentration and total AE and 
infectious AE rates in paediatric CD subjects receiving induction dosing across a large range of 
adalimumab concentrations.  It should be noted that an 80 mg induction dose is used for paediatric CD 
patients weighing between 30 and 40 kg.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adalimumab has been approved for more than 10 years and its safety profile is well characterized at this 
stage, with infections and risks related to malignancies being well-known risks. The proposed dosing 
schedule for Humira in adult HS is quite high, and HS is one of the highest dosed indications for Humira. 
Still, the safety profile of adalimumab in the adult HS studies did not appear different from what that 
previously observed with adalimumab in other indications, except for rather frequent reporting of 
hidradenitis as an AE. This included the rate or severity of infections, including SSTIs.  
As mentioned above, no clinical data are available in adolescents with HS. Hence, extrapolation is made 
from use in other indications. 
Adalimumab is approved for use in children and adolescents in other indications, e.g. for the treatment of 
paediatric patients with pJIA (> 2 years), ERA (≥6 years), CD (≥6 years), and Ps (>4 years). The 
maximal dosing regimens (40 mg eow) are similar to that proposed for adolescent HS. However, in 
paediatric CD, an intense loading dose regimen (160 mg + 80 mg) and maintenance dose (40 mg ew) 
may be used in certain cases. The incidence of treatment emergent AESI was found similar across these 
paediatric indications and no new safety signals compared with adults have been identified. 
At the CHMP’s request, the Applicant presented safety data in paediatric CD subjects from 6 years of age 
in which similar or higher induction doses were used. No unexpected safety findings were observed in this 
group and no apparent relationship between adalimumab exposure and total AE or infectious AE rates in 
paediatric CD subjects was observed. The extent of paediatric data is rather limited; however, the safety 
data from adult indications also supports the intense loading dose regimen and a 40 mg ew regimen. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Humira in adolescent HS is likely not to be substantially different for this age group 
and indication compared with those already approved. Humira can be used in children as young as 2 years 
in other indications, so there is experience from use in paediatric patients. The target group for this 
indication is adolescents 12-17 years old, thus, not a very young population, so large differences vs. 
adults are not expected.

The experience of use of high loading dose regimens in paediatric patients is not large; however, no 
unexpected safety findings were observed in in paediatric CD subjects from 6 years of age in which similar 
or higher induction doses were used and no apparent relationship between adalimumab exposure and 
total AE or infectious AE rates in paediatric CD subjects was observed.  
Use of a 40 mg ew regimen in adolescents has sufficient support from use in paediatric Crohn´s disease, 
albeit with limited data from clinical trials. In addition, sufficient reassurance is given from the use of 
Humira 40mg ew in adult patients with RA and Ps with insufficient response to 40 mg eow.   
In addition, no relationship between adalimumab dose or exposure with safety has not been observed.  
In conclusion, the safety profile in this new indication with the revised regimen is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 12.1.1 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 12.1.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes to the section 4.1 are highlighted below; for full changes please refer to the Product information. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults and adolecents patientsfrom 12 years of age with an inadequate response to 
conventional systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
“No additional consultation with target patient groups is included in this application, since the changes to 
the package leaflet proposed are minimal, and similar to information already presented in the package 
leaflet for the adult hidradenitis suppurativa indication and other indications.”

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
HS is a serious, chronic, inflammatory skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents with painful, 
deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, such as the axillary, 
inguinal and anogenital regions. The disease is characterized by recurrent inflamed nodules and 
abscesses, which may rupture to form fistulas and ooze purulent drainage and lead to scarring. HS is 
associated with several complications like the development of anal, urethral and rectal strictures and 
fistulas. Scarring and fibrosis can lead to contractures and limitations in limb mobility. HS has a severely 
negative impact on quality of life, which is often worse compared to other skin diseases.  
Humira (adalimumab) was approved in the HS indication in adults in 2015. There are few randomized, 
controlled trials of medical therapies or other interventions in the treatment of HS. Thus, treatments vary 
widely and are not well characterized. These include medical treatments (e.g. systemic therapy with 
clindamycin and rifampicin, tetracyclines, intralesional triamcinolone and others), surgical treatments 
and laser treatment.  
The application for Humira in the adults HS indication was supported by two adequately designed and 
performed phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe HS. Both studies met the primary efficacy 
end-point (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response, HiSCR), albeit with different size of the effect vs. 
placebo (42% and 59%, respectively, for HiSCR at week 12 vs. 26-27% for placebo). Thus, it was 
concluded that the efficacy of adalimumab in adults with moderate to severe HS was deemed clinically 
relevant, including positive outcomes related to patient-reported QoL. The indication approved in adults 
is a second line indication, in patients with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. 
A second line indication is presently applied for adolescents.  
To prevent the risk of overdosing, a loading dose regimen in adolescents of 80mg has been proposed by 
the MAH. The MAH has also proposed to introduce the possibility to increase the dose to the adult 
maintenance dose (40 mg ew) in case of insufficient response. This dosing regimen is considered 
satisfactory by the CHMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The current application relates to an extension of the adult HS indication to include adolescents from the 
age of 12 years with HS. This application is based solely on extrapolation and no clinical data are available 
in adolescents with HS. In order to use an extrapolation approach, it has to be assumed with reasonable 
certainty that the PK/PD relationship is similar in adults and adolescents. Due to the rarity of the 
condition, there is limited information to support this view; however, since the condition seems to occur 
mainly after onset of puberty and likely has a hormonal component, it seems reasonable that the 
condition is similar in adolescents and adults. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adalimumab has been approved for more than 10 years and its safety profile is well characterized at this 
stage, with infections and risks related to malignancies being well-known risks. The proposed dosing 
schedule for Humira in adult HS is quite intense, and HS is one of the highest dosed indications for 
Humira. Still, the safety profile of adalimumab in the adult HS studies did not appear different from what 
Assessment report

that previously observed with adalimumab in other indications, except for rather frequent reporting of 
hidradenitis as an AE. This included the rate or severity of infections, including SSTIs.  
Adalimumab is approved for use in children and adolescents in other indications, e.g. for the treatment of 
paediatric patients with pJIA (> 2 years), ERA (≥6 years), CD (≥6 years), and Ps (>4 years). The 
maximal dosing regimens (40 mg eow) are similar to that proposed for adolescent HS. However, in 
paediatric CD, an intense loading dose regimen (160 mg + 80 mg) and maintenance dose (40 mg ew) 
may be used in certain cases. The incidence of treatment emergent AESI was found similar across these 
paediatric indications and no new safety signals compared with adults have been identified. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As mentioned above, no clinical data are available in adolescents with HS. Hence, the safety profile in the 
population targeted in this extension application is based on extrapolation from use in other indications.  
The experience of use of high loading dose regimens in paediatric patients is not large; however, no 
unexpected safety findings were observed in in paediatric CD subjects from 6 years of age in which similar 
or higher induction doses were used and no apparent relationship between adalimumab exposure and 
total AE or infectious AE rates in paediatric CD subjects was observed.   
Use of a 40 mg ew regimen in adolescents has sufficient support from use in paediatric Crohn´s disease, 
albeit with limited data from clinical trials. In addition, sufficient reassurance is given from the use of 
Humira 40mg ew in adult patients with RA and Ps with insufficient response to 40 mg eow.     
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The use of PK and PKPD modelling to extend the adult HS indication to adolescents is considered the best 
option available considering the very low prevalence of HS in adolescents and is also in accordance with 
the PIP for Humira in HS. Even if the condition is rare, in particular in the adolescent group, it does exist 
in adolescents and well-studied treatments are overall few in HS. 
To prevent the risk of overdosing, a loading dose regimen in adolescents of 80mg has been proposed by 
the MAH. The MAH has also proposed to introduce the possibility to increase the dose to the adult 
maintenance dose (40 mg ew) in case of insufficient response. This dosing regimen is considered 
satisfactory by the CHMP. 
From a safety perspective, the safety profile isn’t expected to be substantially different for this age group 
and indication compared with those already approved. Humira can be used in children as young as 2 years 
in other indications, so there is experience from use in paediatric patients. The target group for this 
indication is adolescents 12-17 years old, thus, not a very young population, so large differences vs. 
adults are not expected. No specific safety issues are foreseen for this new target group. Use of a loading 
dose regimen and an every week posology (if needed) has support from safety data in other indications. 
In addition, no relationship between adalimumab dose or exposure with safety has been observed. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The current application relates to an extension of the adult HS indication to include adolescents from the 
age of 12 years with HS. This application is based solely on extrapolation and no clinical data are available 
in adolescents with HS.

hidradenitis suppurativa for adolescents from 12 years of age.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma France submitted on 9 October 2020 an 
application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tavneos, through 
the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility 
to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 12 December 2019. 
Tavneos, was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 19 November 2014 in the following 
conditions: “Treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis” (EU/3/14/1373) and “Treatment of 
microscopic polyangiitis’’ (EU/3/14/1372). 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Tavneos is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0103/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0103/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance avacopan contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

PRIME assistance 
ChemoCentryx obtained priority medicines (PRIME) designation for avacopan (CCX168) in treatment of 
patients with GPA or MPA on 26 May 2016. 
A  Conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  (CMA)  was  submitted  to  EMA  by  the  applicant  ChemoCentryx 
based on the Phase 2 data (studies CL002_168 and CL003_168). Given the near-term availability of the 
pivotal Phase 3 data, ChemoCentryx decided to withdraw the CMA on 22 January 2019 and refocused 
efforts on completion of the Phase 3 ANCA associated vasculitis study.  
The  Phase  3  trial  CL010_168  has  been  completed  (last  patient  last  visit:  November  2019)  and  the 
resulting data provides the basis to establish benefit/risk in support of the current MAA. 
ChemoCentryx  and  Vifor  Fresenius  Medical  Care  Renal  Pharma  France  (VFMCRP)  have  established 
contractual agreements enabling VFMCRP to be the applicant for the MAA of  avacopan in EU Member 
States and certain other countries. Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma France (VFMCRP) is now 
the applicant for avacopan hard capsules. Avacopan is currently not in a PRIME scheme.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tavneos was proposed by the applicant for “treatment of adult patients with granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)”. 
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a multisystem autoimmune 
condition that occurs due to production of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. The disease is 
characterised by generalised inflammation of small to medium sized blood vessels that can affect many 
different organ systems but commonly involves the kidneys. The two main forms of the disease are 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).  
GPA can affect any organ or tissue but has a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory tracts and 
the kidneys, with >75% of patients having renal involvement that is associated with progressive 
glomerular nephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with ANCA positivity by immunofluorescence 
and positive testing for the proteinase 3 (PR3)-antigen. MPA can be distinguished from other forms of 
small vessel vasculitides by the absence of granuloma formation, and by the predominance of 
perinuclear ANCA staining by immunofluorescence and positive testing for the myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
antigen. If left untreated, 80% of patients with GPA or MPA die within 2 years of disease onset and 
mortality is higher for patients with renal involvement. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAVs) are classified as orphan diseases, with an incidence of about 20 per 
million population per year estimated for Europe and North America; there is a slight male 
preponderance and incidence rate increases with age. Annual reported incidence rates for ANCA-
associated glomerulonephritis in Europe are between 1.2 and 1.3 per 100,000 adults, with a similar 
incidence seen in Japan, as described in the scientific literature. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
AAV are characterised by the production of circulating autoantibodies against the neutrophil-expressed 
antigens myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) and involve complement activation and C5a 
production. The applicant stated that central role of C5a and its receptor C5aR has been proposed in 
the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, as per the published literature, and that C5a primes 
neutrophils and enhances ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Neutrophils activate the alternative 
complement pathway through endogenous properdin secretion and neutrophils also release C5a when 
stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor α. The C5a, acting on C5aR, has 
been reported to be a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and agonist, which triggers homotypic 
neutrophil aggregation via interactions of the tumour necrosis factor activated αMβ2 (Mac-1)-integrins 
with intercellular adhesion molecule-3 or inactivated complement fragment 3b on bystander 
neutrophils. Deformability is important for non-activated neutrophils for unperturbed movement 
through small blood vessels such as in the glomeruli. The C5a decreases neutrophil deformability, 
particularly in the presence of ANCA. ANCA bound to endothelial-adherent neutrophils activate the 
classical complement pathway, and lastly, C5a activates endothelial cells, promoting retraction and 
increased permeability.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Patients with all forms of AAV commonly present with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as 
sinusitis, dyspnoea, rhinitis, nasal polyps and conductive deafness. Renal involvement is present in the 
majority of patients with MPA and GPA and is asymptomatic until advanced renal failure occurs. 
According to the EULAR recommendations, a diagnosis should be supported by a biopsy from affected 
organ. 
2.1.5.  Management 
A treatment algorithm guiding the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis based on the European 
League Against Rheumatism and European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant 
Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) recommendations is presented below. 
Algorithm for the Management of New ANCA-Associated Vasculitis 
Source: Yates et al, 2016. 
Cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids or rituximab plus glucocorticoids are currently considered the 
standard of care for ANCA-associated vasculitis. Cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids or rituximab 
plus glucocorticoids are considered the standard of care induction therapy for organ or life-threatening 
AAV. Patients typically receive 0.5 to 1 g IV glucocorticoids, followed by oral glucocorticoids, 1 
mg/kg/day, tapered according to local practice and treatment response. Chronic glucocorticoid use is 
associated with an increased risk of new onset/worsening of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of bone, glaucoma, cataracts, psychiatric disorders, and other 
debilitating side effects. Cyclophosphamide is given for 3-6 months with variable remission rates 
Assessment report  
Page 10/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
depending on the definition used. Patients are often switched from cyclophosphamide to azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate due to toxicity concerns with long-term cyclophosphamide 
use. 
Rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody which depletes B lymphocytes, in combination 
with glucocorticoids, was shown to be non-inferior to cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids in inducing 
remission in AAV in two randomised controlled trials. Rituximab plus a glucocorticoid has been 
approved for treatment of patients with GPA or MPA.  
Maintenance treatment includes immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate 
mofetil, or methotrexate. Glucocorticoid treatment is also often used during maintenance. Adjuvant 
treatment includes plasmapheresis in patients with severe progressive renal failure. 
Due to the serious side effects associated with current therapies, including glucocorticoids, there is a 
major unmet medical need in AAV. There is need for safer, convenient therapeutic agents that are able 
to rapidly bring disease activity under control, and that can safely maintain remission.  
About the product 
Avacopan (previously known as CCX168) is proposed to selectively inhibit the binding of complement 
5a (C5a) to the C5a receptor (C5aR, also called CD88): C5a is a terminal component of the 
complement cascade. Avacopan is being developed as new, orally administered, first in class C5aR 
antagonist treatment for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. 
The recommended dose of Tavneos is 30 mg avacopan (3 hard capsules of 10 mg each) taken orally 
twice daily. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 10 mg of avacopan as active substance.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
General information 
The chemical name of avacopan is (2R,3S)-2-[4-(cyclopentylamino)phenyl]-1-(2-fluoro-6-
methylbenzoyl)-N-[4-methyl-3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperidine-3-carboxamide corresponding to the 
molecular formula C33H35F4N3O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 581.64 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of avacopan was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated by a 
combination of elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, 
mass spectrometry, and specific optical rotation. Single crystal x-ray diffractometry was used for 
definitive structure determination. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) and particle size distribution. 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline solid. It is practically 
insoluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. The manufacturing process ensures that 
the most stable polymorphic form is isolated. Due to the low aqueous solubility, the finished product is 
a solid solution within a capsule in which avacopan is present in amorphous form. 
Avacopan exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres (2R,3S configuration). 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Avacopan is synthesised convergently in several steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The starting materials were defined in line with scientific advice provided by 
CHMP. The process ensures the correct absolute and relative stereochemistry around the piperidine 
ring. 
Several critical steps were identified during development and investigated by extensive uni- and multi-
variate experiments. Certain steps were optimised through extensive design of experiments (DoE) 
studies. Critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified and optimised following a further DoE 
study. However, no design spaces are claimed. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Assessment report  
Page 12/109 
 
 
 
 
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified.  
The primary contact materials comply with EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (FTIR, 
HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric impurity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
elemental impurities (ICP-MS), water content (KF) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Elemental and solvent 
impurities are controlled according to accepted ICH limits. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 12 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance from the intended 
commercial manufacturer are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. Supportive data from 4 batches from a different manufacturer used earlier in 
development, using a different synthetic route, also complied with the specifications in place at the 
time. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities (including the enantiomer) and 
water content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested attributes remained within their specifications and no trends were observed. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted in order to demonstrate the stability indicating nature of 
the analytical procedures. Samples were exposed to aqueous acid, base or peroxide or extreme 
temperature (solid state). Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was also performed. 
Extensive degradation was observed under all 3 aqueous conditions. Slight degradation was observed 
on exposure to extreme heat or light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at not more 
than 25ºC in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a size 0 hard capsule containing 10 mg avacopan as active substance. The 
capsules are light orange/yellow opaque bicolour printed with “CCX168” in black ink with a clear gelatin 
sealing band. Qualitative composition is listed in SmPC and section 2.2.1 
The aim of development was an immediate release oral dosage form able to meet clinical, safety, 
quality and commercial requirements. A quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined according to 
ICH Q8 and formed the basis of development work. 
Formulation development and development of manufacturing process have been discussed. Drug 
product manufactured by from previous suppliers and was used to supply the Phase 2 clinical trials. In 
2016, the drug product formulation, manufacturing process, and supporting analytical methods were 
transferred to a new manufacturer for the manufacture of the Phase 3 clinical supplies and in 
preparation for commercialisation. 
The active substance is practically insoluble in aqueous media, irrespective of pH, but highly permeable 
and is thus considered a BCS class 2 molecule. Therefore, a solubility enhancing formulation was 
needed in order to provide acceptable bioavailability. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The relative amounts of 
active substance and excipients was set in order to ensure the active substance is fully dissolved 
during formulation and storage. 
The size 0 gelatine capsule is quite big, and the posology generally requires 6 capsules to be ingested 
per day. Therefore, the CHMP recommended further work in order to develop a formulation with an 
increased active substance load [REC 001]. This would reduce the need for patients to swallow so 
many large capsules daily and improve compliance. 
Dissolution method development was conducted in parallel with formulation and process development. 
The specification was set in line with clinical batch data.  
Discriminatory power was investigated using formulations with different excipient ratios (to reduce 
solubility) or containing a proportion of crystalline active substance. Incomplete dissolution was 
observed in these formulations, indicating that the method is suitably discriminatory. 
The manufacturing process was designed to dissolve the active substance in a heated molten excipient 
solution Critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified and ranges were established to ensure 
complete dissolution of avacopan into the fill solution. 
The primary packaging is an HDPE bottle with child-resistant closure and induction seal. The material 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: melting and dissolution of the capsule contents; 
encapsulation; drying; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
Page 14/109 
 
 
 
 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 consecutive production scale batches 
of finished product. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The CPPs including mixing temperature 
and time are sufficiently controlled and reported. The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form including appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC) and water content (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits for impurities have been appropriately justified. The discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method has been demonstrated. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data, no additional for elemental impurities are deemed necessary. 
A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). The applicant tested several batches of 
finished product and of active substance for common low molecular weight nitrosamines using an 
appropriately sensitive, validated GC-MS/MS method which did not detect any nitrosamine impurities. 
Based on the information provided, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 14 pilot to production scale batches from the proposed 
commercial manufacturer, along with 6 pilot scale batches from manufacturers used earlier in 
development, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market, through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 9 pilot to production batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 36 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 65% 
RH)    and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging representative of that proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution  and  water  content.  All 
attributes  remained  within  their  specification  and  no  significant  changes  were observed,  other  than  a 
small increase in water under accelerated conditions. 
Assessment report  
Page 15/109 
 
 
 
 
In addition, samples were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No change was observed for capsules stored within the HDPE bottle. 
However, capsules stored outside the bottle underwent some degradation, with an increase in impurities 
and  a  decrease  in  assay.  The  finished  product  is  more  photosensitive  than  the  active  substance  and 
should thus be stored in its container. 
An  in-use  stability  study  was  conducted  on  samples  stored  under  either  long  term  or  accelerated 
conditions. At the start of the study, the bottles had been stored sealed for 9 months under long term 
conditions. Bottles were opened daily and tested at regular intervals for up to 180 days. No significant 
trends were observed, other than an increase in water under accelerated conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and stored within the HDPE bottle 
in order to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to the development of a more patient-friendly 
formulation with a higher active substance load. This point is put forward and agreed as a 
recommendation for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to develop a more patient-friendly formulation with a higher 
active substance load in order to reduce the number of large capsules to be swallowed daily.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro 
The antagonistic properties of avacopan and/or the metabolite CCX168-M1 were evaluated in 
chemotaxis assays, ligand binding assays, and calcium mobilisation assays. In a myeloid human cell 
line, avacopan functionally inhibits C5a-mediated chemotaxis  with an IC50 of 0.92 nM. Additionally, 
avacopan displaces 125I-C5a from hC5aR with an IC50 of 0.45 nM. When tested on freshly isolated 
human neutrophils, avacopan inhibits  the C5a-mediated increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels with 
an IC50 of 0.2 nM. 
Avacopan was evaluated for its ability to inhibit C5a-mediated effects on neutrophils in freshly isolated 
human whole blood. First, in a C5a-mediated neutrophil migration assay in  whole blood, avacopan 
produced 50% inhibition (IC50) at a concentration of 1.7 nM;  90% inhibition required an avacopan 
concentration of 15.4 nM. Second, in a C5a-mediated upregulation assay of the adhesion molecule 
CD11b on the surface of neutrophils in freshly isolated whole blood, avacopan treatment made 
neutrophils two-fold less sensitive to C5a stimulation at a concentration of 4.8 nM; in whole blood, 
90% inhibition required an avacopan concentration of 43 nM. 
Avacopan also inhibits C5aR in cynomolgus monkeys and hamsters with potencies in a similar range 
to that observed with human whole blood. However, avacopan possesses moderate potency for rabbit 
C5aR (IC50  ~4 µM) and lacks affinity for mouse or rat C5aR (IC50  >10 µM). 
One major human metabolite, CCX168-M1, has been identified in human plasma in a Phase I study, 
(CL001_168). This metabolite is equivalent to avacopan in its potency towards hC5aR. CCX168-M1 
has an IC50 of 3 nM for inhibition of C5a-mediated whole blood neutrophil chemotaxis and a potency 
of 7 nM for  inhibition of C5a-mediated neutrophil CD11b upregulation in whole blood. Like  avacopan, 
the metabolite CCX168-M1 has comparable potency for cynomolgus monkey,  hamster, and human 
C5aR, moderate potency against rabbit C5aR (IC50 ~3 µM) but lacks  affinity for mouse or rat C5aR 
(IC50  >10 µM). 
In vivo 
As avacopan retains little, if any, potency for C5aR expressed by mice or rats, the applicant 
generated a human C5aR knock-in (hC5aR KI) mouse strain in which the mouse C5aR gene was 
replaced with the human C5aR gene. The model seems validated by data indicating that the innate 
immune cells of these hC5aR KI mice respond normally to human (or mouse) C5a and in a highly 
sensitive manner to avacopan (i.e that the human C5aR in these transgenic mice is fully functional). 
In vitro, avacopan blocks hC5a-mediated chemotaxis of leukocytes freshly isolated from these  hC5aR 
KI mice with an IC50 of 13 nM in 100% mouse plasma.  
Avacopan has been evaluated in mechanism-based studies in monkeys and in the hC5aR KI mouse 
model evaluating the effect of avacopan on hC5a-induced neutropenia. Ex vivo, the effect of avacopan 
on C5a-mediated CD11b upregulation on blood leukocytes from the hC5aR KI mouse was evaluated. 
Finally, avacopan was studied in an ANCA disease model in hC5aR KI mice. In the mechanism-based 
monkey model, avacopan caused a complete inhibition of hC5a-induced neutropenia at plasma 
Assessment report  
Page 17/109 
 
 
 
 
concentrations of ~230 nM (134 ng/mL) i.e. above the cynomolgus whole blood IC90 (162 nM), while 
concentrations of ~38 nM (22 ng/mL) around the cynomolgus whole blood IC50 (18 nM) resulted in 
~50% inhibition. Hence, in this model, avacopan can significantly reduce C5a-induced neutropenia in 
monkeys. 
In the hC5aR KI mouse model, an intravenous dose of 20 µg/kg hC5a robustly induced leukopenia 
(>50% drop from baseline) within one minute after injection. Pre-treatment of these mice with an 
oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg avacopan resulted in a plasma concentration of  approximately 75 nM at one 
hour which almost completely blocked the C5a-induced leukopenia. A dose of 0.03 mg/kg avacopan, 
corresponding to a plasma concentration of 15 nM (~9 ng/mL)  resulted in a 50% reduction in the 
C5a-induced leukopenic response. 
The amount of avacopan required to hinder C5a-mediated CD11b upregulation on blood leukocytes in 
plasma was evaluated further with an ex vivo assay using hC5aR KI mice. Following an orally 
administered dose of vehicle or avacopan, blood was collected and stimulated in vitro with increasing 
concentrations of hC5a, resulting in increased CD11b expression on blood neutrophils. The potencies 
(EC50) of hC5a for CD11b upregulation on neutrophils from vehicle and avacopan-treated mice were 
compared in the context of the measured avacopan plasma concentration. C5a inhibition was generally 
proportional to avacopan in this assay. On average, a plasma concentration of 38 nM (~22 ng/mL) 
avacopan was required to shift the C5a EC50 value 10-fold. 
ANCA disease is a small vessel vasculitis perpetrated by autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasm-
expressed proteins such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3). Complement C5a has a 
critical role in this disease process. In a manner that requires activation of the alternative complement 
pathway, passive transfer of antibodies to MPO (anti-MPO) induces ANCA necrotising and crescentic 
glomerulonephritis in mice that closely mimics human disease. In this anti-MPO-induced mouse disease 
model, antibody-mediated blockade of C5a prevents disease. Moreover, knocking out the C5a receptor 
makes mice resistant to ANCA disease in this model system. In this ANCA vasculitis mouse model, 
anti-MPO antibodies were injected intravenously into 10-week old female hC5aR KI mice on Day 0. The 
mice were dosed orally with 0 (vehicle), 0.1, 1, 10 (2x5) or 37.5 mg/kg avacopan for 7 days. On Day 
7, mice were euthanised and kidneys were evaluated histologically for glomeruli containing necrosis 
and crescents. In addition, serum and urine samples were analysed for indicators of kidney 
dysfunction. Vehicle-treated mice developed glomerular crescents and necrosis, the primary hallmarks 
of disease, by Day 7. Mice treated at 10 (2x5) and 37.5 mg/kg/day showed significant reductions in 
the incidence of glomerular crescent formation and necrosis relative to vehicle-treated mice. At the 
same dose levels, the mice exhibited significant reductions in indicators of kidney dysfunction, 
including urinary protein levels and urinary leukocyte and erythrocyte numbers. An avacopan dose of 
37.5 mg/kg q.d., reduced the percentage of glomeruli with crescents by 93% on average, and the 
percentage of glomeruli with necrosis by 100% on average. At 37.5 mg/kg, avacopan mean plasma 
concentrations range from 4380 ng/mL (at 1 hour) to 276 (at 24 hours). Thus, the effective avacopan 
plasma concentrations seem to be between 200 and 4000 ng/mL. The mean steady-state trough 
avacopan plasma concentration at the intended therapeutic dose in humans is ~204 ng/mL. The active 
dose levels of 10 and 37.5 mg/kg corresponds to HEDs of 0.8 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. Thus, the 
dose span (HED of 0.0024 to 3 mg/kg) investigated seems relevant to the human recommended dose 
of 60 mg/day (~1 mg/kg/day). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Avacopan displays ~10,000-fold or greater selectivity for hC5aR relative to most other chemotactic 
receptors, and 6,700-fold for CCR5 and 8,000-fold for CCR10. These include CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, 
Assessment report  
Page 18/109 
 
 
 
 
CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CCR12, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6, 
CXCR7, C5L2, C3aR, ChemR23, GPR1, and FPR1. 
Avacopan was further evaluated against a panel of 55 unrelated receptors and membrane-associated 
proteins. At 10 µM (~5.8 µg/mL) avacopan showed weak activity on the human Adenosine A2a (42% 
inhibition) and A3 receptors (33% inhibition), as well as on the sodium channel (site 2).The weak 
activity of avacopan was observed at exposures >16,000-fold the clinical Cmax (unbound) for avacopan 
of 0.349 ng/mL. The metabolite CCX168-M1 was tested against a panel of 17 related chemotactic 
receptors and a panel of 56 unrelated receptors and membrane-associated proteins. Only weak activity 
was detected at 10 µM (~6 µg/mL); 53% inhibition at cannabinoid receptor type 1, 64% inhibition at 
sodium channel (binding site 2), and 51% inhibition at GABA-gated chloride channel. The weak activity 
of metabolite CCX168-M1 was observed at exposures around 49,000-fold the clinical Cmax (unbound) 
for CCX168-M1 of 0.122 ng/mL. 
As patients with the indications being pursued who may receive avacopan may also be receiving 
glucocorticoids as part of their treatment, the ability of avacopan and CCX168-M1 to block the 
glucocorticoid receptor was evaluated using radio-ligand binding assays. No antagonist activity was 
observed for either compound in these assays. Furthermore, avacopan and CCX168-M1 were evaluated 
for their ability to inhibit cellular proliferation of lymphocytes, either alone or together with 
cyclophosphamide. Neither avacopan nor CCX168-M1 affected the ability of cyclophosphamide to 
inhibit cellular proliferation; by themselves, avacopan and CCX168-M1 also did not affect cellular 
proliferation. Neither avacopan nor CCX168-M1 had any activity on 11β-HSD2, an enzyme involved in 
the metabolism of corticosteroids. Both compounds were thus found to be inactive in these assays, 
indicating low potential for interference with the biological effects or metabolism of either 
cyclophosphamide or corticosteroids. 
Safety pharmacology 
Avacopan was tested in the following battery of safety pharmacology assays: 
CNS, respiratory and renal systems: Evaluation of behaviour, blood pressure, ECG and respiratory 
assessments were included in the monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies. No effects on behaviour, 
respiratory rates, and  kidney function were noted in the monkey studies at dose levels up to 30/45 
mg/kg/day and avacopan and CCX168-M1 exposures corresponding to ~5.2- and 4.4-fold the clinical 
AUC, respectively.  
Cardiovascular system: Cardiovascular effects of avacopan and CCX168-M1 were evaluated in vitro 
and in vivo. In vitro data indicate that avacopan inhibited hERG ionic conductance by 26% at a 
concentration of 2.3 μM (~1.3 µg/mL), the maximal concentration testable due to solubility 
constraints. The major human metabolite CCX168-M1 inhibited hERG ionic conductance by 37% at a 
concentration of 3 μM (~1.8 µg/mL), the maximal concentration of the compound achievable without 
precipitation. Exposure margins for avacopan and CCX168-M1 of about 4000- and 14000-fold, 
respectively, relative to human Cmax,free plasma levels. Based on these data, a low risk of pro-
arrhythmic/torsadogenic effects is predicted for avacopan and CCX168-M1. 
In the telemetry study in conscious monkeys, there were no effects on cardiovascular (blood pressure) 
and electrocardiographic parameters (P, PR, QRS, QT and QTc intervals, and R amplitude) following 
single oral doses up to 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. At 50 mg/kg, blood pressure values were 
slightly reduced (≤12%) versus vehicle. This slight effect was not statistically significant and all mean 
and individual values were within the range of normal biologic variation. At the highest dose tested (50 
mg/kg), the mean avacopan plasma concentration at 4 hrs (approximate Tmax) post-dose was 1182 
ng/mL, corresponding to about 3.3-fold the Cmax at MRHD (349 ng/mL). 
Assessment report  
Page 19/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, no evidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities was seen in vivo in the 28-day, 20-
week, and 44-week repeat-dose monkey studies.  Mean plasma levels of 1845 and 2470 ng/mL 
(avacopan) and 573 and 548 ng/mL (CCX168-M1) were achieved in the 20-week and 44-week studies, 
respectively. These exposures represent 5.2- to 7.0-fold (avacopan), and 4.4- to 4.6-fold (CCX168-M1) 
the clinical AUC.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. This is considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, clearance, distribution, and metabolism properties of avacopan and its major 
metabolite CCX168-M1 were evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Absorption: Avacopan is highly permeable across the Caco-2 monolayer membrane and is not a 
substrate of  efflux transporters. Following intravenous dosing, avacopan showed moderate total body 
clearance (30 to 50% of liver blood flow) in mice, rats and dogs. The terminal elimination half-life 
ranged from approximately 2 hours in mice and rats to 14.2 hours in dogs. Following oral dosing of the 
crystalline neutral form at 2 mg/kg in a suspension, avacopan was rapidly absorbed in mice and rats 
with low to moderate bioavailability (17% to 27%). When dosed orally as a solution, bioavailability of 
50% to 100% was observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg in rats. Several organic vehicles were explored 
for rat, rabbit, hamster, and cynomolgus monkey oral pharmacokinetics at several dose levels; the 
maximum exposure following single oral administration was reached at 100 mg/kg. 
Distribution: Both avacopan and its metabolite CCX168-M1 are plasma protein bound  reversibly at 
>99.9% in plasma of mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, dogs, monkeys and humans over the 
concentration range of 2.5 to 50 µM. Avacopan is reversibly bound to human albumin and α1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) at >99.9%, while CCX168-M1 is reversibly bound to human albumin and AAG at 
99.9% and ~99%, respectively. Avacopan and CCX168-M1 do not selectively partition to red blood 
cells. The tissue distribution profile of a single oral dose of [14C]-avacopan in rats showed that the 
radioactivity was rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed into tissues and organs. Distribution 
profiles were similar in non-pigmented (male) and pigmented (male/female) rats. In non-pigmented 
male and female rats, the tissues with the highest [14C]-avacopan-related  radioactivity 
concentrations were liver, brown fat, white adipose, adrenal glands, urinary bladder  (male), 
Harderian gland (male), preputial gland (male), pancreas (female) and myocardium  (female). In the 
pigmented (male and female) rats, the tissues with the highest concentrations were liver, brown fat, 
white adipose, adrenal glands, Harderian gland, pancreas, kidney and renal  substructures (male), 
cecum (female), and small intestine (male). The Cmax  of [14C]-avacopan-derived radioactivity was 
greater in white adipose than for most other tissues from 8 through 72  hours post dose. Distribution 
trends in the pigmented uveal tract suggested that [14C]-avacopan-related radioactivity associated 
with the melanin-containing tissues of the eye; this association was slowly reversible. The total 
exposure to radioactivity was low to moderate when compared to other non-melanin containing 
tissues. Radioactivity levels in the skin were similar in pigmented and non-pigmented rats and were 
measurable through 72 and 336 hours post dose, except in pigmented male rats, where levels were 
BLQ at 336 hours post dose. The total exposure to radioactivity was moderate when compared to other 
non-melanin containing tissues. The elimination of radioactivity from pigmented skin and non-
pigmented skin occurred at a similar rate, suggesting that there was no apparent selective affinity of 
[14C]-avacopan-derived radioactivity for integumentary melanin. 
Assessment report  
Page 20/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution to placenta was not investigated.  
Metabolism: When incubated with cryogenically preserved hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, and 
humans, avacopan demonstrated low to moderate intrinsic clearance. In hepatocytes and liver 
microsomes of several species (mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, dog, monkey, or human), the most 
abundant metabolite was CCX168-M1, identified as a product of methyl hydroxylation of avacopan. 
Several minor metabolites, including CCX168-M6, were also observed, all primarily products of 
Phase I biotransformation of avacopan. 
Definitive in vivo metabolite profiling studies with an oral dose of [14C]-avacopan in rats, monkeys, and 
humans showed that avacopan was the most abundant radioactive component in plasma across these 
species, while CCX168-M1 was the only major circulating metabolite. This metabolite is equivalent to 
avacopan in its potency towards hC5aR. In human plasma, avacopan and metabolite CCX168-M1 
accounted for 18% and 11.9% of the total plasma radioactivity, respectively. CCX168-M1 is considered 
qualified as adequate exposure has been achieved in the evaluation of safety pharmacology, general 
toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies. This major metabolite was also qualified in the 
carcinogenicity studies. 
Excretion: Mass balance studies were carried out in rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and healthy human 
subjects, with oral administration of [14C]-avacopan. Results from the rat and human studies showed 
high total radioactivity recovery (>97% in rats and >86% in humans), while the monkey mass balance 
was approximately 72% due to complications from diarrhoea caused by PEG-400 in the dosing vehicle. 
In all three species, the major elimination pathway is metabolism through CYP3A4-mediated oxidation 
in the liver, and the metabolites are primarily excreted into faeces via bile. Hepatic or renal direct 
excretion of the unchanged avacopan is minimal. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of avacopan has been evaluated in a set of non-clinical studies including 
repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in hamsters, up to 26 weeks rats and up to 44 weeks 
monkeys; in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity; fertility and early embryonic development (hamster) and 
embryo-fetal development (EFD) (hamster and rabbit) and pre- and post-natal development 
(hamster); in vitro phototoxicity and in silico and in vitro impurity qualifying studies. Two-year 
carcinogenicity studies (hamster and rat) were submitted during the evaluation.  
The hamster and Cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent toxicology 
species as justified by pharmacology and pharmacokinetic data showing that avacopan binds to 
cynomolgus monkey and hamster C5aR with potencies similar to those seen for human C5aR, and that 
these species are relevant from a metabolism perspective. Toxicity studies in rats were designed to 
assess off-target adverse effects. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single-dose toxicity study in rats showed that oral administration of avacopan up to 100 mg/kg was 
well tolerated with no significant effects in any of the investigated parameters.  
Assessment report  
Page 21/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Avacopan has been evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in hamsters (up to 13 weeks with 4 
weeks recovery), rats (up to 26 weeks with 6 weeks recovery) and monkeys (up to 44 weeks with 6 
weeks recovery). No dose-limiting effects or target organ of toxicity were noted in the chronic studies 
and therefore, the toxicology of avacopan is not considered fully explored.  However, the maximum 
dose levels employed were the maximum feasible dose levels based on dose volume and formulation 
concentration constraints, and/or formulation tolerability. To further maximise exposure, twice daily 
dosing was used in all chronic studies. Additionally, a saturated absorption was seen in hamsters and 
monkeys. Thus, the repeat-dose toxicity profile has been explored to the extent feasible. 
Avacopan was well tolerated at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in hamsters, 200 mg/kg/day in rats and 
45-50 mg/kg/day in monkeys. These doses were associated with maximal systemic exposure following 
oral administration in each species after optimizing the formulation. Observations in the chronic (26-
week and 44-week) toxicology studies were limited to vehicle-related clinical observations of 
gastrointestinal effects in monkeys and minor clinical pathology effects in rats at doses >100 
mg/kg/day, none of which were considered adverse based upon their magnitude, direction of change, 
reversibility, and absence of any other clinical or microscopic correlate(s). 
Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with ICH S2(R1) guidance have been 
performed with avacopan. In the bacterial reverse mutation assay, avacopan did not cause an increase 
in the mean number of revertants per plate with any tester strains, either in the presence or absence of 
microsomal activation prepared from Aroclor-induced rat liver. Also, avacopan was found to be negative 
for inducing forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK) locus in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. 
The maximum concentrations evaluated in the in vitro studies were limited by solubility and the top 
dose was ~300 µg/plate in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and 300 µM in the mouse lymphoma 
test. 
In vivo, avacopan was negative in the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay, following two consecutive 
daily oral doses up to the dose limit of 2000 mg/kg/day. TK analysis, reported in a separate non-GLP 
study, indicated that avacopan and CCX168-M1 exposure plateaued at the 500 mg/kg dose. Thus, the 
avacopan and CCX168-M1 AUC exposures up to 95930 ng·h/mL and 13825 ng·h/mL, respectively were 
evaluated in the study, correlating to 17-fold, and 5-fold, respectively, the clinical AUC. Distribution to 
the bone marrow was confirmed in the quantitative whole-body autoradiography studies in rat where 
the [14C]-avacopan derived radioactivity in bone marrow was approximately similar to that in blood. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of avacopan was evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and 
hamsters. 
In rats, avacopan treatment was generally well tolerated with no dose-limiting effects observed. Given 
that the TK analysis revealed a saturated exposure, it is agreed that the dose level selection seems 
appropriate. The study was terminated during Weeks 97 and 92 for males and females, respectively, 
due to lower survival in the water or vehicle control groups. This is not considered to impact on the 
assessment of carcinogenic potential as the number of animals evaluated and study duration are 
sufficient.

A slight increased incidence of focal C-cell hyperplasia in the thyroid was noted in males administered 
100 mg/kg/day. The incidences were 11% (6/55), 11% (6/57), 11% (6/57), 12% (7/57) and 19% 
(11/57) at 0 (vehicle), 0 (water), 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. In Covance’s historical 
control dataset, the total incidence in male rats was 2.6% (46/1766) with a range of 0.0 to 21.7%.  
There were no clear indications on neoplasms of an unusual incidence or nature. A slight increased 
incidence of benign C-cell adenoma in the thyroid was however noted in males at 100 mg/kg/day. The 
incidences were 13% (7/55), 11% (6/57), 16% (9/57), 16% (9/57) and 23% (13/57) at 0 (vehicle), 0 
(water), 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. In Covance’s historical control dataset, the total 
incidence thyroid focal C-cell adenomas in male rats was 11% (189/1766) with a range of 2.2 to 
25.5%. Thus, the incidence of thyroid focal C-cell adenomas in male rats at 100 mg/kg/day is above 
the mean total incidence but within the range of the historical controls. In Week 4, the mean AUC0-24h 
values for avacopan was 11500, 25600 and 17400 in males at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, 
respectively, corresponding to 1.6-, 3.6- and 2.5-fold the clinical AUC exposure. In females, the mean 
AUC0-24h values for avacopan was 13600, 33400 and 21400 at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively 
corresponding to 1.9-, 4.8- and 3-fold the clinical AUC exposure. 
In hamsters, avacopan treatment was also well tolerated with no dose-limiting effects observed. No 
saturation of avacopan exposure was observed in hamsters at the selected dose levels. However, 
previous data from the 13-week hamster study indicate saturation of exposure at dose levels above 
100 mg/kg/day. Thus, the dose level selection seems appropriate. 
The study was terminated during Weeks 98 and 92 for males and females, respectively, due to lower 
survival in the water or vehicle control groups. This is not considered to impact on the assessment of 
carcinogenic potential as the number of animals evaluated and study duration are sufficient.  
Administration of 30 or 100 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of mineralisation in the 
ovaries of females and the majority of findings were of minimal severity degree.  The toxicological 
significance is unknown. The study report mentions that this finding has not been noted in previous 
long-term studies in hamsters at the test site and is not reported as a common non-neoplastic 
observation in Syrian hamsters (Kamino et al., 2001, McInnes et al 2015). Mineralisation in ovaries has 
not been observed in rats (up to 2-years) or monkeys (up to 44 weeks).  
Administration of the control article  irrespective of the dose of avacopan, resulted in higher incidence 
and/or severity of pigment in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, colon, and cecum; pigmented 
macrophages in the liver; cystic glands in the rectum; and chronic progressive nephropathy. 
There were no clear indications on neoplasms of an unusual incidence or nature. However, a further 
discussion is requested on the potential increased incidence of benign adrenal phaeochromocytoma in 
female hamsters at 100 mg/kg/day. The incidences were 4.6% (3/65), 4.6% (3/65), 0% (0/65), 3.1% 
(2/65) and 9.2% (6/65) at 0 (vehicle), 0 (water), 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. In 
published data from three 2-year hamster studies, benign adrenal phaeochromocytoma was reported 
in 1.6% (4/250) control females with the highest individual study incidence of 3.3% (2/60). Thus, the 
incidence at 100 mg/kg/day is outside of this published spontaneous background incidence.  
In Week 26, the mean AUC0-24h values for avacopan was 5560, 21600 and 42000 in males at 10, 30 
and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, corresponding to <1, 3.1- and 6-fold the clinical AUC exposure. In 
females, the mean AUC0-24h values for avacopan was 4290, 24500 and 35600 in at 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day, respectively corresponding to <1, 3.5- and 5.1-fold the clinical AUC exposure.

Reproduction Toxicity 
In the fertility and early embryonic development study in hamsters, there were no significant effects 
on male or female fertility or early embryonic development parameters when tested up to doses of 
1000 mg/kg/day corresponding to 6-fold the expected clinical AUC. In addition, avacopan did not affect 
reproductive organ weights, or caused macroscopic or histopathological findings in reproductive organs 
in any of the investigated species in repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Embryo-foetal developmental studies were performed in hamsters and rabbits. In the pivotal hamster 
study, there were no signs of maternal toxicity, and no alterations in the uterine and ovarian 
examination. The foetal evaluation revealed no external, visceral or skeletal malformations, but there 
was a significant increase in the number of litters and foetuses with skeletal variations, principally 
short thoracolumbar supernumerary ribs, at 1000 mg/kg/day. The applicant is of the opinion that short 
thoracolumbar supernumerary ribs have been demonstrated to be transient and resolve with further 
development of the animal. As such, it is unclear why no directed evaluation of the skeleton was 
included in the pre- and post-natal development study. In the absence of post-natal skeletal data, and 
any other signs of maternal toxicity (i.e. clinical signs or effects on food consumption or body weight), 
the skeletal variations cannot be attributed to maternal toxicity and are considered adverse. Thus, the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 1000 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 5.2-fold the clinical AUC. Based on 
the increased incidence of supernumerary ribs at 1000 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for embryo-foetal 
development is 100 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 5.2-fold the clinical AUC. 
In the pivotal rabbit study, maternal toxicity as seen by an increased incidence in abortions and clinical 
signs were observed at the highest dose tested, 200 mg/kg/day. There were no alterations in the 
uterine and ovarian examination, and there were no avacopan-related gross external, soft tissue or 
skeletal foetal alterations (malformations or variations). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 30 
mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for embryo-foetal development is 200 mg/kg/day, both NOAELs 
corresponding to ~0.6-fold clinical AUC exposure. 
In the pre- and post-natal development hamster study, oral administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day 
avacopan was given from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. Treatment was generally well-tolerated 
in female hamsters during the gestation and lactation periods. No deaths, clinical signs, body weight or 
food consumption differences, gross lesions or changes in organ weights were attributed to avacopan. 
In the F1 generation, there were no findings considered avacopan-related in any of the parameters 
evaluated with exception of the male sexual maturation. There was a small statistically significant 
increase in the preputial separation day values for the male F1 generation offspring at 30, 100 and 
1000 mg/kg/day in comparison with the control group values. The effect may indicate a general 
developmental delay, however, the body weight at the time of preputial separation was similar in all 
study groups indicating that such explanation is unlikely. In general, preputial separation is known to 
be androgen dependent and consequently delays could potentially indicate an estrogenic or anti-
androgenic effect.  
On the basis of these data, the maternal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day, corresponding to ~4-fold 
clinical AUC exposure.  
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetic characteristics of avacopan and its metabolites were determined in the pivotal 
reproductive toxicity studies. 
Assessment report  
Page 24/109 
 
 
 
 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were submitted which is acceptable. The intended route of administration of 
avacopan is oral and local tolerance has been adequately evaluated within the performed non-clinical 
studies. Vehicle-related clinical observations of gastrointestinal effects were observed in monkeys and 
in rabbits. This is not considered a concern in the clinical situation. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity: Avacopan absorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290 to 700 nm) with a peak 
MEC of 2989 L mol-1 cm-1 at 290 nm. The study report concludes that avacopan has potential to be 
photoreactive between 290 and 370 nm. In rat QWBA studies, [14C] avacopan-derived material was 
widely distributed following an oral dose. Distribution trends in the pigmented uveal tract suggested 
that [14C]-avacopan-related radioactivity associated with the melanin-containing tissues of the eye; 
this association was slowly reversible. The total exposure to radioactivity was low to moderate when 
compared to other non-melanin containing tissues. Radioactivity levels in the skin were similar in 
pigmented and non-pigmented rats. 
Based on criteria established in ICH S10, further experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential is 
warranted and the applicant has performed an in vitro phototoxicity study concluded as negative. 
However, the Atlas Xenon lamp used emits light wavelengths in the 300 to 800 nm range 
corresponding to a range noted for all sunlight approximating emitters listed in the OECD guidance, 
while avacopan shows a peak absorption at 290 nm. However, given that avacopan levels in the skin 
were considered moderate and comparable to other tissues and declined at a rate similar to non-
melanin containing tissues and that no adverse reactions in skin are reported in the phase 3 clinical 
trial, further testing is not warranted. In addition, UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a concern for 
pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure since UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis as 
noted in ICH S10. 
In conclusion, the testing strategy is considered acceptable and it can be concluded that avacopan is 
considered as negative for phototoxic potential under the conditions tested. 
Immunotoxicity: The potential immunotoxicity of avacopan has been evaluated by standard 
assessments in repeat-dose toxicology studies and by evaluation of T-cell dependent antibody 
responses induced by KLH in rats and monkeys. However, as avacopan has no activity on the rat C5aR, 
the rat study data are not considered informative. In addition, immunophenotyping of peripheral blood 
was included in the 44-week monkey study.  
In monkeys, avacopan had no effect on T-cell dependent antibody responses or on relative or absolute 
values for peripheral blood immunophenotyping (total T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or natural killer cells). In monkey repeat-dose studies, there were no 
observed histopathological changes in lymphoid organs or alterations in clinical pathology parameters. 
Dependence: No drug dependence studies were submitted. This is considered as acceptable as 
avacopan has a limited distribution to CNS and there was no evidence of CNS effects in safety 
pharmacology or toxicology studies. The intended mechanism of action, antagonism of the C5aR is also 
not suggesting abuse liability. 
Metabolites: In humans, metabolite CCX168-M1 was characterised as a major metabolite (~12 % of 
total plasma radioactivity). This metabolite is equivalent to avacopan in its potency towards hC5aR. 
Metabolite CCX168-M1 is also a metabolite in all non-clinical species and adequate exposure of 
CCX168-M1 has been achieved in the evaluation of safety pharmacology, general toxicity, genotoxicity 
and reproductive toxicity studies. Carcinogenicity studies have been performed in hamsters and rats.

Impurities: Impurities have been evaluated in accordance with ICH M7.  
In vitro, the drug substance intermediate and one impurity did not induce bacterial reverse mutations 
in the presence or absence of metabolic activation with rat liver S9 and are thus considered non-
mutagenic. 
From a non-clinical perspective, no new or additional risks have been identified.

standard Phase IIA risk assessment. The log KOW of avacopan was determined to ≥4.9 (OECD 
TG117), and to 6.98-7.12 (OECD123) at environmental relevant pH values triggering a PBT hazard 
assessment (log KOW ≥4.5). 
A stepwise PBT assessment has been provided. With regards to persistence, avacopan does not 
demonstrate a readily biodegradation profile in activated sludge according to OECD TG301B indicating 
a certain degree of persistence. The degradation and distribution of avacopan in two water-sediment 
systems under aerobic conditions was investigated according to test guideline OECD 308. The 
avacopan degradation rates (DT50) in the sediment and in the total system of one of the two water-
sediment systems are higher than the threshold value of 180 days for the half-life in water-sediment 
systems, as defined as very persistent criterion by ECHA. Thus, avacopan is very persistent (vP) in 
water-sediment systems. Regarding bioaccumulation, a bioconcentration study in rainbow trout was 
conducted according to OECD 305. The steady-state and lipid-normalised growth-corrected kinetic 
bioconcentration factors (BCFSS and BCFklg) of avacopan were in maximum 664 L/kg and hence below 
the bioaccumulation criterion (B) of 2000 L/kg according to ECHA.  Thus, avacopan is not considered 
bioaccumulative. Consequently, avacopan has not to be classified as a PBT substance, since the 
criteria bioaccumulative (B) and vB are not fulfilled. 
In summary, avacopan PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Avacopan is 
considered as vP but is not a PBT substance. Considering the rarity of the indications, the 
environmental exposure will be negligible. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical characteristics of avacopan has been characterised in pharmacology, pharmacokinetic 
and toxicology studies in agreement with relevant guidelines. 
Pharmacology: Avacopan has been developed as a selective antagonist of the complement 5a receptor 
(C5aR) thereby inhibiting the binding of complement 5a (C5a), a terminal component of the 
complement cascade, to the C5aR. 
In vitro, the antagonistic properties of avacopan and its major human metabolite CCX168-M1 were 
evaluated in chemotaxis assays, ligand binding assays, and calcium mobilisation assays. In these 
studies, avacopan and CCX168-M1 were found to be potent antagonists of human, hamster, and 
monkey C5aR, moderately potent against rabbit C5aR, but to be non- or minimally active against 
mouse, rat or rabbit C5aR.  
In vivo, avacopan caused a dose-dependent inhibition of hC5a-induced neutropenia in monkeys and in 
hC5aR KI mice at plasma concentrations of relevance for the clinical situation.  In the ANCA disease 
model in hC5aR KI mice, avacopan caused dose-dependent and significant reductions in the incidence 
of glomerular crescent formation and necrosis relative to vehicle-treated mice, and significant 
reductions in indicators of kidney dysfunction, including urinary protein levels and urinary leukocyte 
and erythrocyte numbers. Overall, in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology data support the 
intended clinical use. Moreover, the in vivo models and the avacopan dose ranges studied are 
considered relevant for the clinical situation.  
Regarding the proposed mechanism of action in SmPC section 5.1, the included statements have been 
supported by data. 
Based on the secondary pharmacology screens, the data indicate a low potential for off-target effects 
of both avacopan and the metabolite CCX168-M1. 
Evaluation of effects on CNS, respiratory and renal systems was performed in rats. As avacopan lacks 
affinity for the rat C5aR, the potential safety pharmacology effects of C5aR antagonism are not 
Assessment report  
Page 27/109 
 
 
 
 
considered evaluated in these rat studies. However, as avacopan and its metabolite CCX168-M1 have 
similar pharmacological activity on human and cynomolgus monkey C5aR, and as safety pharmacology 
parameters including evaluation of behaviour, blood pressure, ECG and respiratory assessments were 
included in the monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies, these data supplement the results from the rat 
pharmacology studies. In short, no avacopan-related effects were observed in any of these parameters 
at the dose levels tested. Based on the in vitro hERG data, a low risk of pro-arrhythmic/torsadogenic 
effects is predicted for avacopan and CCX168-M1. In the telemetry study in conscious monkeys, there 
were no effects on heart rate and electrocardiographic parameters (P, PR, QRS, QT and QTc intervals, 
and R amplitude) following single oral doses up to 50 mg/kg although a slight reduction in blood 
pressure was observed. At the highest dose tested (50 mg/kg), the mean avacopan plasma 
concentration at 4 hrs (approximate Tmax) post-dose was 1182 ng/mL, corresponding to about 3.3-fold 
the Cmax at MRHD (349 ng/mL). Additionally, no evidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities was 
seen in vivo in the repeat-dose monkey studies at exposures represent 5.2- to 7.0-fold (avacopan), 
and 4.4- to 4.6-fold (CCX168-M1) the clinical AUC.  
Overall, based on the available data avacopan and its major metabolite CCX168-M1 have a low 
potential for adverse QT-effects at the intended therapeutic exposure. However, it should also be noted 
that supra-therapeutic exposures have not been evaluated in vivo.  
Pharmacokinetics: Distribution of avacopan to placenta was not investigated. In addition, excretion into 
milk has not been evaluated. However, based on data from the hamster PPND study, avacopan is 
considered likely excreted in maternal milk. 
Toxicology: The toxicology study package is acceptable and has been performed according to relevant 
guidelines. The selection of the main toxicology species, hamster and Cynomolgus monkeys is justified 
based on pharmacology and pharmacokinetic data. 
In chronic studies, no dose-limiting effects or target organ of toxicity were noted and therefore, the 
toxicology of avacopan is not considered fully explored.  However, the repeat-dose toxicity profile has 
been explored to the extent feasible. Exposures of avacopan reached in the pivotal toxicology studies 
exceeded the expected exposures reached with 30 mg b.i.d. in humans. The AUC exposure margins 
relative to the human AUC exposure are approximately 4, 15 and 4 in hamsters, rats and monkeys, 
respectively. 
Questions on species selection, study designs, and timing of carcinogenicity studies were discussed in 
scientific advices given by CHMP in 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3340/1/2016/PA/SME/III and 
EMEA/H/SA/3340/2/2016/PA/SME/III). The species selection (hamster and rat) and the carcinogenicity 
study designs were endorsed. Regarding the proposal to submit these data post-approval, CHMP 
clarified that from a risk point of view, it may be acceptable to have the rodent carcinogenicity data 
available post-approval. However, since safety advantages compared to current therapies are targeted, 
conducting carcinogenicity testing before an approval would provide further support.  
The two-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and hamsters have been submitted as part of the 
responses to the CHMP’s request and showed that the life-time treatment of avacopan was generally 
well tolerated in both species. There were also no clear indications on neoplasms of an unusual 
incidence or nature in neither species. However, a slight increased incidence of benign C-cell adenoma 
in the thyroid was noted in male rats. The finding is likely to be of low toxicological significance but is 
presented in SmPC section 5.3. 
In the pre- and post-natal development hamster study, oral administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day 
avacopan was given from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. Treatment was generally well-tolerated 
in female hamsters during the gestation and lactation periods. No deaths, clinical signs, body weight or 
food consumption differences, gross lesions or changes in organ weights were attributed to avacopan. 
Assessment report  
Page 28/109 
 
 
 
 
In the F1 generation, there were no findings considered avacopan-related in any of the parameters 
evaluated with exception of the male sexual maturation. There was a small statistically significant 
increase in the preputial separation day values for the male F1 generation offspring at 30, 100 and 
1000 mg/kg/day in comparison with the control group values. The effect may indicate a general 
developmental delay, however, the body weight at the time of preputial separation was similar in all 
study groups. In general, preputial separation is known to be androgen dependent and consequently 
delays could potentially indicate an estrogenic or anti-androgenic effect. As requested, a further 
discussion on the delayed preputial separation has been provided. The applicant is of the opinion that 
this is a chance event. It is agreed that there is no evidence for any oestrogenic or anti-androgenic 
effect of avacopan observed by evaluation of standard parameters throughout the provided study 
package.  However, such effects could potentially be subtle and transient. 
Historical background data has been provided and show that the mean preputial separation values in 
vehicle controls and treatment groups were above those obtained in any treatment group in the 
avacopan PPND study, indicating that the day of preputial separation in hamsters is highly variable or 
potentially that the historical controls are not fully relevant to the hamsters included in the avacopan 
study. Moreover, the historical data also show a higher within group variation than in the avacopan 
PPND study. While it is possible that the particularly small variability of the age of preputial separation 
in the control group may be a confounding factor, it is also noted that the overall variability in the 
avacopan-treated groups were smaller than the historical controls. Given these apparent differences 
between the avacopan study data and the historical control data, it is concluded that the within study 
control groups are considered the most relevant. After a further clarification, the CHMP concluded that 
the delayed preputial separation observed at or above dose levels of 30 mg/kg/day in comparison with 
the control groups is considered possibly related to avacopan administration.  The finding is likely to be 
of low toxicological significance but is described in SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3. On the basis of these 
data, the maternal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day, corresponding to ~4-fold clinical AUC exposure. The 
developmental NOAEL in male and female hamsters was 10 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the submitted non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data is adequate. No 
post-marketing investigations were considered necessary by the CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data has been gathered from studies performed in healthy subjects and in the 
target population. Avacopan is extensively metabolised and the most abundant metabolite in plasma is 
M1, which showed similar potency against the C5a receptor (C5aR) compared to avacopan. In the 
mass balance study, avacopan and M1 accounted for 18% and 12% of the total plasma radioactivity, 
respectively. As the protein binding is high (>99.9%) for both avacopan and M1 (Study PC0632_168), 
relative contribution to the in vivo pharmacological effect of avacopan and M1 is difficult to conclude. 
Consequently, in terms of guideline requirements, both avacopan and M1 are considered to be major 
pharmacologically active moieties. Avacopan and metabolite M1 concentrations in human plasma and 
urine samples were analysed by validated LC-MS/MS methods. 
Population PK analysis was based on data obtained from a total of seven clinical studies (Phase 1 
studies CCX1101, CL013_168, CL007_168 and CL008_168, Phase 2 studies CL002_168 and 
CL003_168, and Phase 3 study CL010_168). A total of 368 subjects were included in the model 
development with 232 subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis and 136 subjects in the Phase 1 
studies. 
Two three-compartment models with linear clearance were found to each best describe the PK of 
avacopan and metabolite M1 in subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis as well as in healthy subjects 
in Phase 1 studies treated with avacopan doses up to 100 mg BID. Overall, the population PK model of 
avacopan included food effect on all absorption parameters, body weight as scaling factor on systemic 
and peripheral PK parameters, renal and hepatic biomarkers (i.e., eGFR and ALT, respectively) and age 
on CL/F and serum albumin on Vc/F. In addition, the effects of health status were also evaluated on 
absorption duration and lag time, and on CL/F and Vc/F. The effect of health status on CL/F and Vc/F 
was evaluated. The effect of covariates on CL/F and Vc/F are described below. The PK models were 
used to predict full individual avacopan and M1 concentration-time profiles, which were subsequently 
used in non-compartmental analysis to derive individual Cmax, AUC and Cavg values. 
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of avacopan is unknown, and it is uncertain whether avacopan is a high or 
low permeable compound. Regarding solubility, avacopan is practically insoluble (less than 10 μg/mL) 
across a wide range of conditions (pH 1.1-12.0, SGF and FaSSIF). Consequently, avacopan is 
formulated in a solubility enhancing formulation (50/50 Cremophor RH40 /PEG-4000 capsule). The 
final formulation was used in the clinical Phase II (CL002_168; CL003_168) and III (CL010_168) 
studies in AAV patients. The same formulation was also used in six Phase I studies e.g. CL001_168

impairment; CCX1101 ethnobridging; CL014_168 thorough QT. Based on the poor solubility, avacopan 
is a BCS 2 or 4 compound.  
Avacopan pharmacokinetics profile is approximately dose linear, with a dose-proportional increase in 
systemic exposure in the dose range of 10 to 30 mg and a slightly more than dose-proportional 
increase in the dose range 30 to 100 mg. Across studies performed during fasting conditions, 
absorption occurred with median Tmax at approximately 2 hours. Administration of a high-fat, high-
calorie meal increased avacopan AUC by approximately 70% compared to administration under fasted 
conditions in study CL007_168. Cmax was more comparable, with only an 8% increase under fed 
conditions compared to fasted. Tmax was delayed by approximately 3 hours. The AUC of M1 under fed 
conditions was comparable to when administered under fasted conditions while Cmax was 
approximately 50 % lower under fed administration relative to fasted. A similar food effect on 
avacopan PK (fed/fasted AUC ratio 2.1) was also observed in the ethnobridging study (CCX1101) with 
Japanese subjects given a 30 mg single-dose avacopan with a low fat meal except that Tmax was 
delayed to a lesser extent by only 1 hour in the fed state. Metabolite M1 AUC in Study CCX1101 stayed 
the same in the fed state while its Cmax decreased about 40%. 
The result from the food interaction study CL007_168 is presented below: 
Summary of Statistical Comparisons of Plasma avacopan 
Summary of Statistical Comparisons of Plasma M1 
Distribution 
Mean Vz/F was in the range of 3,000 to 11,000 L following a single oral dose of 30 mg avacopan in 
healthy subjects in Studies CL001_168, CCX1101, CL007_168 and CL013_168. Both avacopan and M1 
were protein bound at >99.9% in plasma over the concentration range of 2.5 – 50 μM. Avacopan 
steady state Cmax at the proposed clinical dose is approximately 0.3 µM. Based on both in vivo and in 
Assessment report

vitro data, blood-to-plasma ratios were less than 1, suggesting that both compounds have limited 
penetration into red blood cells. 
Elimination 
Liver metabolism, followed by biliary and renal excretion of the metabolites, is the primary route of 
elimination for the absorbed avacopan, while biliary and renal excretion of the unchanged parent drug 
plays a negligible role. The results from the mass balance study indicate that avacopan was the 
primary component present in plasma, accounting for approximately 18% of the total radioactivity. 
There was one major metabolite in plasma, M1, which accounted for approximately 12% of the dose. 
The metabolic pathway responsible for conversion of avacopan into M1 was studied using human liver 
microsomes and was found to be mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree by CYP2C19 and 
CYP2D6. In healthy subjects, the steady state was achieved after approximately 5 days of twice daily 
dosing. The ratio of steady state AUC0-τ vs single-dose AUCinf is in the range of 1.5 – 2.2, suggesting 
a modest degree of time-dependent PK.  
According to population PK analysis the typical apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of avacopan is 13.1 - 
21.1 L/h at the therapeutic dose of 30 mg b.i.d. The median terminal elimination half-life of avacopan 
is 21 days. In ANCA-associated vasculitis subjects receiving twice daily 30 mg avacopan for 52 weeks 
(CL010_168), steady-state trough plasma concentrations of avacopan and metabolite M1 appear to be 
reached by Week 13.  
Based on the ADME study, approximately 87% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the excreta 
within 14 days, with faeces as the primary route of elimination, accounting for 77% of the dose, and 
urine as the secondary route, accounting for 9.5% of the dose. In faeces, unchanged avacopan 
accounted for approximately 7% of total radioactivity. The remainder of the dose was excreted as 
metabolites, with M1 as the most abundant metabolite in faeces, accounting for approximately 7% of 
the dose. Approximately 0.02% of the dose was excreted unchanged in urine. Several metabolites 
were detected in urine, but none accounted for more than 3% of the total dose. 
Special populations 
Regarding renally impaired patients, the applicant has not performed a dedicated renal impairment 
study. The applicant refers to the mass balance study where approximately 0.02% of the dose was 
excreted unchanged in urine. The effect of renal impairment was evaluated in the population PK 
analysis where 237 patients with renal impairment, over the range of mild to severe impairment, were 
included. Based on the population PK analysis results, avacopan CL/F decreased modestly with 
moderate renal impairment (RI) and moderately with severe renal impairment: Subjects with 
moderate RI (eGFR of 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and severe RI (eGFR of 15-30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are 
expected to have 33%-15% and 47%-33% lower CL/F values a typical subject with eGFR of 94 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Based on the estimate of eGFR effect on CL/F of  M1,  moderate  (eGFR=30-60 
ml/min/1.73 m2)  and  severe (eGFR=15-30 ml/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment would decrease the 
clearance of M1 by 10-24% and 24-35%, respectively. 
In a study in subjects with hepatic impairment there was only a minor effect on total concentrations of 
avacopan and M1 in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. 
The effect on unbound concentrations could not be evaluated due to the very high plasma protein 
binding. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not included in the study.  
No clinically relevant effects on avacopan PK due to gender, race, old age or weight are expected.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The in vitro results indicate that CYP3A4 metabolism is an important elimination pathway. This was 
confirmed in vivo in study CL008_168 where co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
itraconazole resulted in a 2-fold increase in avacopan AUC. In vivo, upon co-administration with 
multiple doses of rifampicin (enzyme inducer), avacopan AUC and Cmax were significantly reduced. 
Avacopan AUC decreased by 93% and Cmax by 79% respectively.  
The in vitro results indicate a possible CYP3A4 time dependent inhibition. No induction is seen for 1A2 
and 2B6 in the relevant concentration range of avacopan. For 3A4 borderline induction is seen in the 
concentration range relevant for induction of systemically expressed enzymes (up to 0.2 µM) and 
inconclusive results at concentrations relevant for intestinal. The net effect is described in vivo where 
avacopan was administered concomitantly with a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam). Avacopan increased 
midazolam AUC approximately 1.8-fold which suggests that avacopan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 in 
vivo. An in vivo study has been performed where avacopan was administered concomitantly with a 
CYP2C9 substrate (celecoxib). The effect of avacopan on celecoxib was small and mainly related to 
Cmax. The CYP2C9 inhibitory potential of avacopan is thus considered to be minor. Further, the 
celecoxib in vivo interaction study showing no effect supports that avacopan is not a PXR-inducer in 
vivo. 
On the transporter side, avacopan showed negligible to weak inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, 
OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1 and OAT1 in vitro. Furthermore, avacopan was not a 
substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp or BCRP in vitro. In vitro, M1 did not inhibit the transporters P-
gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Based on in vitro data M1 
might be a substrate of P-gp. M1 was not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BCRP in vitro. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The primary PD effects of avacopan were investigated in the Studies CL001_168 and CL002_168. The 
cardiodynamic effects of avacopan were surveyed in the Study CL007_168 and Study CL014_168. 
Mechanism of action 
Avacopan selectively inhibits the binding of complement 5a (C5a) to the C5a receptor (C5aR, also 
called CD88); C5a is a terminal component of the complement cascade. Based on literature data, C5a 
and its receptor C5aR has a central role in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis; C5a primes 
neutrophils and enhances ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Neutrophils activate the alternative 
complement pathway through endogenous properdin secretion and neutrophils also release C5a when 
stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor α. The C5a, acting on C5aR, is a 
potent neutrophil chemoattractant and agonist, which triggers homotypic neutrophil aggregation via 
interactions of the tumour necrosis factor activated αMβ2 (Mac-1)-integrins with intercellular adhesion 
molecule-3 or inactivated complement fragment 3b on bystander neutrophils. Deformability is 
important for non-activated neutrophils for unperturbed movement through small blood vessels such 
as in the glomeruli. The C5a decreases neutrophil deformability, particularly in the presence of ANCA. 
ANCA bound to endothelial-adherent neutrophils activate the classical complement pathway. Lastly, 
C5a activates endothelial cells, promoting retraction and increased permeability. 
Assessment report  
Page 35/109 
 
 
 
 
Murine models have shown that alternative complement pathway activation is critical to development 
of MPO ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis. Anti-C5 treatment can prevent this glomerulonephritis, as 
can depletion of complement using cobra venom factor. Furthermore, complement factor B (an 
essential factor for alternative pathway activation) knockout mice are protected against development 
of ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis. Importantly, blocking the C5aR with avacopan prevents the 
development of ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis in the anti-MPO murine model.  
The applicant claimed that plasma C5a was significantly higher in patients with active ANCA vasculitis 
compared with patients in remission, as described in the literature. The C5a was increased in the 
plasma and urine of patients with active ANCA vasculitis in another study. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Phase I study CL001_168 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period study in 
which 48 subjects received either avacopan or placebo (3:1 ratio) as a single dose and as multiple 
once daily or twice daily doses. In Period 1, single doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg avacopan were 
studied; 6 subjects in each dose cohort received avacopan and 2 received placebo, except in cohort 1 
in which 5 subjects received avacopan and 3 received placebo. In Period 2, avacopan doses of 1, 3, 
and 10 mg once daily for 7 days, and 30 and 50 mg twice daily for 7 days, were studied. The effect of 
avacopan on neutrophil migration and C5a-induced CD11b upregulation was studied. Two functional 
assays were developed and tested on blood samples. Specifically, blood samples were collected from 
subjects in the 10, 30, and 100 mg dose cohorts from the single-dose period, and the 30 mg BID dose 
cohort from the multi-dose period. The relationship between the avacopan plasma concentration and 
the inhibition of C5aR-dependent upregulation of the integrin CD11b in peripheral blood neutrophils 
and inhibition of C5aR-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis was determined. 
Blood neutrophils from avacopan-treated, but not placebo-treated, subjects were impaired in their 
ability to functionally respond to exogenously added recombinant C5a, indicating that avacopan 
effectively blocked C5aR in the treated subjects. The level of blockade correlated strongly with 
avacopan plasma concentrations. The 30 mg BID dose of avacopan resulted in extended (>12 hour) 
inhibition of C5aR, indicating that 30 mg BID dose regimen provides around-the-clock coverage of the 
C5aR, see figure below. Inhibition of C5a-mediated migration of neutrophils in blood taken from these 
subjects was also observed. Therefore, 30 mg avacopan BID was selected as the dose regimen 
subsequent clinical trials in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

The placebo group (in red solid line) showed no shift in the C5a concentration vs. granulocyte CD11b expression 
curve, whereas the avacopan 30 mg BID group (in blue dashed line) showed a >10-fold shift in the curve at both 
the 2-hour and 12-hour (trough level) time points. 
When investigating secondary pharmacology in the phase I studies Study CL001_168, a slight 
decrease in mean WBC and neutrophil count was observed more frequently in subjects receiving 
CCX168 compared to placebo. Adverse events of white blood cell decreased occurred only in the 
avacopan group. Low White Blood Cell Counts were observed also in the phase II and phase III studies 
and will be discussed in the Clinical Safety section. 
Effect on complement: In phase II study CL002_168, in addition to the samples from treated vasculitis 
patients, plasma samples (matched for age, gender, and ethnic background) were collected from 
healthy subjects for use as a control group. The following was measured: Bb, C3a, C5a, sC5b-9 and 
Properdin. Patients with active AAV (n=66) had higher baseline levels of complement activation 
products in circulation than healthy controls (n=20). The levels of Bb, C3a and C5a were significantly 
reduced in patients treated with standard of care but did not return to healthy control levels for C3a 
and C5a. Decreases were also observed in the group treated with avacopan with low dose prednisone. 
No changes, considered as statistically significant, occurred in the five complement fragments in 
avacopan only treated patients. The outcome for plasma sC5b-9 levels (at baseline as compared to 
healthy controls and during treatment) are provided in the tables below.

used in both analyses. Both studies covered the expected therapeutic concentration range. In study 
CL014_168 the preferred Fridericia’s correction factor (correction factor 1/3), ΔQTcF, was used in the 
analysis, whereas in study CL007_168 an individual correction factor (mean correction factor 0.34), 
ΔQTcI, was used. Nonetheless, in both studies no apparent trends towards QT prolongation with 
increased plasma avacopan or M1 plasma concentrations were detected. 
The risk of drug-drug interactions between avacopan and other concurrent medications in the intended 
patient population is  considered to be low based on a series of biochemical studies conducted in vitro; 
these studies included assessment of serum protein binding, red blood cell partitioning, hepatocyte 
metabolism, cytochrome (CYP) inhibition and induction, effects of avacopan on cyclophosphamide 
metabolic activation, prednisone metabolism, and Caco-2 monolayer permeability. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A population PK analysis was performed with a pooled dataset of phase 1, 2 and 3 studies. Due to 
model complexity, parent compound (avacopan) and the major metabolite (M1) were modelled 
separately and previously developed structural models were used as the basis for the present model 
development. Overall, the three-compartment structural models described avacopan and M1 data 
sufficiently well. The covariate selection was based on visual screening as well as clinical and scientific 
plausibility. Covariates that were selected to be included in the model was judged statistically 
significant if the confidence interval for the covariate effect did not include null. The covariate 
modelling methodology, also called the full covariate approach, is accepted. Avacopan is chiral and has 
two chiral centres and the applicant has performed analysis of some plasma samples in study 
CL014_168 using a chiral liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method and the 
chiral analysis only detected avacopan and not the enantiomer or any of the diastereomers and 
suggests no inter-conversion in vivo. 
The absorption, distribution and elimination characteristics of avacopan and M1 have been sufficiently 
described. 
The applicant did not perform a dedicated renal impairment study, but the effect of renal impairment 
was evaluated in the population PK analysis which is considered acceptable since 237 patients with 
renal impairment, over the range of mild to severe impairment, were included in the analysis dataset. 
The  
population PK analysis detected a maximum 47% decrease in avacopan CL/F and 35% decrease in 
metabolite M1 CL/F due to renal impairment. Thus, the increase in exposure due to renal impairment is 
not substantial and supports the conclusion that no dose adjustment based on renal function is 
warranted, as reflected in the SmPC. 
Since avacopan is primarily cleared through hepatic metabolism, a hepatic impairment study has been 
performed. The applicant has presented individual Child Pugh scores for subjects with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment and the individuals included in the study are not fully representative of 
the moderate Child Pugh class and the effect on avacopan could be underestimated in subjects with 
moderate HI that have effects on albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time. However, three subjects in 
the moderate HI group had impairment in serum bilirubin or serum albumin and the plasma exposure 
were not higher than the healthy control group. This supports that no dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with mild and moderate Child-Pugh and the proposed SmPC wording is acceptable. 
The in vitro results indicate that CYP3A4 metabolism is an important elimination pathway. This was 
confirmed in study CL008_168 where co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in avacopan AUC, which is considered acceptable. Co-administration with 
Assessment report  
Page 38/109 
 
 
 
 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is advised to be used with caution. The applicant also discussed non-clinical 
safety data from the thorough QT-study CL014_168 and exposure-safety data. Taken all together, a 
doubling of the plasma exposure could be accepted by the CHMP. The suggested SmPC text with the 
advice of caution and monitoring for potential increase of side effects when concomitant administration 
of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is supported. 
In vivo, upon co-administration with multiple doses of rifampicin (enzyme inducer), avacopan AUC and 
Cmax were significantly reduced. Avacopan AUC decreased by 93% and Cmax by 79% respectively. 
These results indicate that avacopan is strongly affected by enzyme inducers and co-administration of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers with avacopan should be avoided according to the SmPC which is acceptable. 
Avacopan increased midazolam AUC with approx. 81% which suggests that avacopan is a weak 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo. Nevertheless, avacopan may have clinically relevant effects on CYP3A4 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus). Information regarding this risk is appropriately 
included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Literature data indicate that the excipient Cremophor RH40 could inhibit P-gp and literature reports 
that Cremophor RH40 increased digoxin systemic exposure in vivo in humans after an oral dose. The 
currently observed increase in digoxin exposure of about 22% might not be clinically relevant, but at 
the same time it is indicative of P-gp inhibition in the intestine, which could be even more pronounced 
for other P-gp substrates with lower oral bioavailability. A clinically relevant effect of Cremophor RH40 
on sensitive P-gp substrates with relatively low bioavailability cannot be excluded. Information 
regarding the risk of interaction between Cremophor RH40 and sensitive P-gp substrates is included in 
section 4.5 in the SmPC. 
The results of the studies assessing the primary PD effect of avacopan support the proposed 
hypothesis of mechanism of action, selective inhibition of the binding of complement 5a (C5a) to the 
C5a receptor. It was shown in the Study CL001_168, that the ability of the neutrophils to functionally 
respond C5a-induced activation is impaired with simultaneous administration of avacopan. This 
response was measured by the inhibition of the upregulation of CD11b by the neutrophils. The 
response correlated with the avacopan plasma concentrations. The results of the second assay 
investigating the chemotaxis of neutrophils were also supportive indicating trend towards decreased 
chemotaxis of neutrophils.  
The  phase  2  study  CL003_168  and  the  phase  3  study  CL10_168  included  collection  of  PD  markers. 
Reports of PD markers from these studies are not included in the submission. The PD reports of these 
studies will be submitted as a post-approval measure. 
In both, the healthy controls and in subjects with AAV, avacopan was associated with a decrease in 
WBC, as discussed in the section on Clinical Safety. Concentration-QTc relationships were evaluated on 
study CL007_168 and CL014_007 data. Both avacopan and M1 plasma concentrations were included in 
the evaluations and no statistically significant relationship between plasma concentration and QT 
prolongation was detected.  
Overall, the available pharmacology data are considered adequately described in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology testing concerning PK, PD effects of avacopan is sufficient and results are 
adequately reflected in the product information. The CHMP considers that the following measure is 
necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-finding studies have been conducted. The avacopan dosing of 30 mg twice a day used 
in the phase 2 studies is based on the PD results of the study CL001_168 in healthy subjects. A dose of 
50 mg b.i.d. for 7 days was also used in study CL001_168, but PD assessment was conducted neither 
for that higher dose nor for subjects with AAV. However, since the findings of study CL001_168 support 
the chosen dose, the lack of specific dose-finding studies can be accepted. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
One  Phase  3  clinical  trial  (CL010_168,  ADVOCATE)  has  been  conducted  and is  considered  the  pivotal 
study. Two Phase 2 clinical trials (CL002_168 and CL003_168) were conducted evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of avacopan for AAV.

Study CL010_168: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of CCX168 (avacopan) in Patients with Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody 
(ANCA)-Associated Vasculitis Treated Concomitantly with Rituximab or Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine 
Methods 
Study CL010_168 was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled 
clinical study assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of avacopan in subjects with newly-
diagnosed or relapsing active ANCA-associated vasculitis when administered against a standard 
background cyclophosphamide or rituximab regimen. The study treatment period was 52 weeks with 
an 8-week follow-up period. Av overview of the study design is shown below.

Study Participants  
Key inclusion criteria were:  
1.  Had a clinical diagnosis of GPA (Wegener's) or MPA, consistent with Chapel-Hill Consensus 
Conference definitions; 
2.  Aged at least 18 years, with newly-diagnosed or relapsed ANCA-associated vasculitis where 
treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab was needed; where approved, adolescents (12 
to 17 years old) may have been enrolled.  
3.  Tested positive for anti-PR3 or anti-MPO (current or historic) antibodies;  
4.  Had at least one major item, or at least three minor items, or at least the two renal items of 
proteinuria and haematuria in the BVAS;  
5.  Had an eGFR ≥15 mL/minute/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] 
method for adults, and modified Schwartz equation for adolescents) at screening. 
Among key exclusion criteria were: 
1.  Alveolar haemorrhage requiring invasive pulmonary ventilation support anticipated to last 
beyond the screening period of the study 
2.  Other known multi-system autoimmune disease including eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), systemic lupus erythematosus, immunoglobulin (Ig)A vasculitis 
(Henoch-Schönlein), rheumatoid vasculitis, Sjögren's syndrome, anti-glomerular basement 
membrane disease (GBM), or cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis; 
3.  Required dialysis or plasma exchange within 12 weeks prior to screening;  
4.  Had been taking an oral daily dose of a glucocorticoid of more than 10 mg prednisone-
equivalent for more than 6 weeks continuously prior to the screening visit. 
Treatments 
Prior to randomisation, subjects were stratified based on standard background treatment (intravenous 
[IV]  cyclophosphamide,  oral  cyclophosphamide,  or  IV  rituximab),  ANCA  positivity  status,  and  ANCA-
associated vasculitis disease status (newly diagnosed or relapsed disease).  
Following stratification, subjects were subsequently randomised using the stratification factors, in a 1:1 
ratio  to  one  of  two  study  treatments:  avacopan  or  placebo.  Adult  subjects  were  to  receive  30  mg 
avacopan or matching placebo twice per day (BID). For subjects who were 12 to 17 years old, initial 
avacopan or placebo doses were selected based on body weight and further refined based on avacopan 
plasma exposure. 
Group A (comparator group): 
•  Avacopan-matching placebo (3 tablets) twice daily orally for 52 weeks (364 days) 
•  Oral prednisone tapering regimen over 20 weeks (140 days)  
The prednisone tapering schedule is presented below.

Group B (avacopan group): 
•  Avacopan 30 mg (three 10 mg tablets) twice daily orally for 52 weeks (364 days) 
•  Oral prednisone-matching placebo tapering regimen over 20 weeks (140 days) 
Subjects in both Groups A and B also received either IV or oral cyclophosphamide followed by oral 
azathioprine, or IV rituximab, as follows: 
• 
IV cyclophosphamide 15 mg/kg IV up to 1.2 g maximum was given on Day 1 and also at the 
Week 2, 4, 7, 10, and 13 study visits.  
•  Oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 200 mg/day) was given orally starting on Day 
1 and continuing up to the day before Week 15.  
•  Oral and IV cyclophosphamide dose was adjusted based on the subject’s age, eGFR, and WBC 
count according to protocol-specified criteria 
Note: For subjects in either the oral or IV cyclophosphamide stratum, starting at Week 15, all 
received oral azathioprine at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day, with titration up to a target dose 
of 2 mg/kg/day at 2 weeks. If azathioprine was not tolerated, mycophenolate mofetil at a target 
dose  of  2  g/day  may  have  been  given.  If  mycophenolate  mofetil  was  not  tolerated  or  not 
available, enteric coated mycophenolate sodium may have been given at a target dose of 1440 
mg/day. 
• 
IV rituximab on Day 1, and then Weeks 1, 2, and 3 at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at each visit for a 
total of 4 weekly infusions  
o  Glucocorticoid pre-medication for the rituximab IV infusions was allowed. 
Prior glucocorticoid use of up to 3 g methylprednisolone equivalent IV within the 4 weeks before 
screening or 10 mg prednisone-equivalent per day oral for not more than 6 continuous weeks was 
allowed Per Protocol (PP). During the screening period (of up to 14 days), IV glucocorticoids were 
allowed as long as the cumulative dose did not exceed 3 g methylprednisolone equivalent for both the 
screening and pre-screening periods. If a subject received oral glucocorticoids during the screening 
period, the dose needed to be tapered to ≤20 mg prednisone equivalent by Day 1 of the study. 
During the treatment period, subjects receiving ≤20 mg prednisone equivalent on Day 1, were tapered 
to no glucocorticoid use over a 4-week period. In cases of adrenal insufficiency, a prednisone

equivalent dose of ≤10 mg per day could be used. Subjects who experienced relapse during the study 
could receive IV glucocorticoids (typically 0.5 to 1 g methylprednisolone per day over 3 days) and/or 
oral glucocorticoids, tapered according to the subject's condition. Glucocorticoid pre-medication for 
rituximab infusion, typically 100 mg methylprednisolone equivalent IV, was permitted. Subjects who 
experienced worsening disease during the study that involved a major BVAS item could be treated with 
IV glucocorticoids (typically 0.5 to 1 g methylprednisolone per day for 3 days) and/or oral 
glucocorticoids, tapered according to their condition. Worsening of disease not involving a major BVAS 
item could be treated with a short (≤2 weeks) burst of oral glucocorticoids at a maximum dose of 20 
mg prednisone equivalent. Any glucocorticoid use was recorded in the case report form. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan to induce and sustain remission in 
subjects with active ANCA-associated vasculitis, when used with cyclophosphamide followed by 
azathioprine, or with rituximab (non-inferiority vs prednisone). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were as follows:  
1.  The proportion of subjects achieving disease remission at Week 26. 
Disease remission at Week 26 was defined as: 
a.  Achieving a BVAS of 0 as determined by the Adjudication Committee (AC); 
b.  No administration of glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis within 
4 weeks prior to Week 26; 
c.  No BVAS >0 during the 4 weeks prior to Week 26 (if collected for an unscheduled 
assessment).  
2.  The proportion of subjects achieving sustained disease remission at Week 52. 
Sustained remission at Week 52 was defined as: 
a.  Disease remission at Week 26 as defined above;  
b.  Disease remission at Week 52 defined as a BVAS of 0 at Week 52 as determined by the 
AC and no administration of glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis 
within 4 weeks prior to Week 52;  
c.  No disease relapse between Week 26 and Week 52 as determined by the AC.  
Please refer to the statistical section for further details on the testing strategy. 
Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) version 3 was used for evaluation of activity of systemic 
vasculitis for definition of remission, sustained remission, and relapse.  
The BVAS has been previously validated. There are 9 organ systems, plus an “Other” category in the 
BVAS, each of which is given a numerical value according to its perceived clinical relevance as decided 
by expert consensus. Only symptoms/signs ascribed to the presence of active AAV (GPA or MPA) were 
to be reported in the standardised form.  
One modification was made to the BVAS version 3 for the purpose of this study: For the Week 4 BVAS 
assessment, disease activity present within the 7 days, instead of 28 days, prior to the visit was to be 
Assessment report  
Page 44/109 
 
 
 
 
recorded. This was done to avoid inclusion of the baseline visit (which could have occurred within the 
prior 28 days) from the BVAS assessment at Week 4. The “persistent” disease aspect of the BVAS version 
3 was not used, since for the purpose of this study, only the presence or absence of disease activity was 
assessed. The calculation of BVAS was be performed programmatically. A total score was calculated from 
the individual organ system scores as described below. 
BVAS Organ Systems, Individual Items and Scoring 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows (not controlled for type 1 error): 
1.  Glucocorticoid-induced toxicity as measured by change from baseline over the first 26 weeks in 
the glucocorticoid toxicity index;  
2.  BVAS of 0 at Week 4, regardless of whether the subjects received glucocorticoids during this 
period of time and based on assessment by the blinded AC; 
3.  Change from baseline over 52 weeks in health-related quality of life as measured by the 
domains and component scores of the SF-36v2 and EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and 
index;  
Assessment report  
Page 45/109 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  Proportion of subjects and time to experiencing a relapse after previously achieving remission 
at Week 26 in the study; relapse was defined as occurrence of at least one major item in the 
BVAS, or three or more minor items in the BVAS, or one or two minor items in the BVAS 
recorded at two consecutive visits, after having achieved remission at Week 26 (BVAS = 0 and 
no glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis within 4 weeks) in the study;  
5.  In subjects with renal disease at baseline (based in the BVAS renal component), the change in 
eGFR from baseline over 52 weeks;  
6.  In subjects with renal disease at baseline (based in the BVAS renal component), the percent 
change in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline over 52 weeks;  
7.  In subjects with renal disease at baseline (based in the BVAS renal component), the percent 
change in urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1):creatinine ratio from baseline 
over 52 weeks;  
8.  Change in the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) from baseline over 52 weeks, including the Week 
26 and Week 52 time points. 
Sample size 
The proportion of subjects in the prednisone group achieving clinical remission at Week 26 was 
estimated to be ~60%, a blended proportion of 64% and 53% observed in the rituximab and 
cyclophosphamide/azathioprine groups, respectively, in the largest prior registration study in ANCA-
associated vasculitis. A non-inferiority margin of -20 percentage points was derived for the difference 
between avacopan and prednisone groups, and a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. This non-inferiority 
margin was based on a thorough review and meta-analysis of all previous clinical studies conducted in 
subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis, as well as precedent. A sample size of 150 subjects per 
group (300 in total) was estimated to provide more than 90% power for the non-inferiority test. This 
sample size provided 90% power to detect approximately 18% superiority in the proportion of subjects 
achieving clinical remission at Week 26 if the control group remission rate was 60%. The proportion of 
subjects in the prednisone group with sustained remission at Week 52 was estimated to be ~45%, a 
blended proportion observed in a prior study comparing rituximab and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine 
in ANCA-associated vasculitis (Specks et al, 2013). A sample size of 150 subjects per group (300 in 
total) was estimated to provide 85% power to detect approximately 18% superiority if the control 
group sustained remission rate at Week 52 was 45%. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed centrally via an IRT system and minimisation algorithm, using the 
stratification factors: 1) IV rituximab, IV cyclophosphamide, or oral cyclophosphamide use (selection of 
treatment at the discretion of the Investigator prior to randomisation); 2) anti-PR3 or anti-MPO ANCA-
associated vasculitis, and 3) newly-diagnosed or relapsed disease. The study was double-blind, double 
dummy, i.e., placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the avacopan capsules, and prednisone 
capsules also had matching placebo capsules.

associated vasculitis, and 3) newly-diagnosed or relapsed disease. The study was double-blind, double 
dummy, i.e., placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the avacopan capsules, and prednisone 
capsules also had matching placebo capsules.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis compared the remission rates for the two primary efficacy endpoints for the ITT 
population based on the stratification variables that were the same factors used in the randomisation 
and included standard of care immunosuppressant regimen, ANCA positivity, and ANCA-associated 
vasculitis status. The primary endpoint analyses were based on the adjudicated BVAS remission at 
Week 26, and adjudicated BVAS sustained remission at Week 52 results. For the purpose of analysis of 
these endpoints, glucocorticoid use refers to both, study supplied (i.e., the prednisone study 
medication) and non-study supplied medication (i.e., glucocorticoid use other than the prednisone 
study medication). The same analyses as described for the Primary Analysis was also conducted for the 
Per- Protocol population. 
For the two primary efficacy endpoints, the proportion of subjects achieving disease remission at Week 
26 and sustained disease remission at Week 52, and the two-sided 95% confidence (CIs) for the 
difference in proportions (avacopan minus prednisone) was estimated for the comparison between the 
avacopan group and the comparator group. For both the noninferiority and superiority tests, the one-
sided P-values are presented. Statistical significance was claimed based on the one-sided type-I error 
of 0.025. The non-inferiority margin was -20%. 
Confidence intervals for the stratified analysis were calculated using inverse-variance stratum weights 
and Miettinen-Nurminen (score) confidence intervals and for un-stratified analyses Wald confidence 
limits were used. The Clopper–Pearson exact interval is provided for single proportion data. 
For secondary endpoints of glucocorticoid toxicity, analysis of change from baseline was performed in 
the ITT population using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). Separate models for 
GTI-CWS and GTI-AIS will incorporate treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction and 
stratification factors as covariates. The stratification factors will be the same factors as used in the 
randomisation stratification. In the MMRM model, missing data will not be imputed, using a missing at 
random (MAR) assumption. 
Analysis populations were defined as follows: The Randomised Population included all subjects who 
provided written informed consent and were randomised in the study. The ITT Population included all 
subjects who were randomised in the study and who received at least one dose of blinded study drug. 
The PP Population consisted of all subjects in the ITT population who were compliant with taking 
avacopan/placebo and who did not have major protocol deviations that could have significantly 
affected the interpretation of the results.  Other protocol deviations, and immunosuppressant use, 
were imputed as non-remission in the PP population.  
The two primary endpoints were first tested for noninferiority and then for superiority according to a 
prespecified multiplicity procedure. A successful study was to be declared if (at minimum) non-
inferiority was achieved for the avacopan group versus the comparator group for remission at Week 
26.  
Secondary endpoints were tested in parallel and nominal p-values provided. For the primary endpoints, 
missing data at Week 26 and Week 52 were imputed as not achieving remission (Week 26) or 
sustained remission (Week 52), respectively, for the ITT population analyses. Tipping point analyses 
for missing data Week 26 and Week 52 were provided.  No imputation was performed for other time 
points. No imputation was performed for missing safety endpoints, including safety laboratory values,

In response to CHMP’s request, the applicant provided baseline characteristics per stratum, see table 
below. The following differences of subjects’ baseline characteristics in the CYC/AZA stratum compared 
with the RTX stratum were identified: 
•  Higher mean age 
•  More males than females 
• 
Predominantly newly diagnosed versus relapsed subjects 
Assessment report  
Page 50/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Consistent with a higher proportion of newly diagnosed subjects, a substantially shorter 
disease duration 
•  Higher BVAS 
•  Worse renal function based on eGFR 
In summary, the patients in the CYC stratum exhibited characteristics associated with a more severe 
disease and worse outcomes compared with the patients in the RTX stratum at the time of 
randomisation to avacopan or prednisone.

The applicant also provided additional results for the proportion of patients with BVAS=0 by study visit, 
irrespective of relapses and irrespective of GC use within the 4-week period prior to Weeks 26 and 52. 
These sensitivity analyses were requested by the CHMP to be provided for confirmation of the efficacy 
results, especially since the results at Week 52 differed between the RTX and CYC strata. Due to the 
high impact of intercurrent events on the response rates and the fact that sustained response at Week 
52 is defined from a single time point (Week 26) onwards, it was considered relevant to see the results 
on BVAS without these restrictions. Overall, a great majority (>80%) of patients had BVAS = 0 from 
Week 16 onwards in both study arms.

Proportion of patients with BVAS=0 by study visit, overall population 
In the rituximab stratum (Table below), the proportion of subjects with BVAS = 0 fluctuated over time, 
being alternately higher in the comparator and the avacopan arms. From Week 26 onwards, there 
appears to be no clear difference between the arms despite the fact that the comparator group was 
using placebo after end of induction treatment.  
Proportion of patients with BVAS=0 by study visit, overall population, rituximab stratum 
 In the cyclophosphamide stratum, fluctuation in the proportion of subjects with BVAS = 0 is also seen. 
(Table below). At Week 52, the proportions are similar: 48/75 subjects (84.2%) in the prednisone arm 
and 49/59 subjects (83.1%) in the avacopan arm. 
Proportion of patients with BVAS=0 by study visit, overall population, cyclophosphamide stratum 
Hence, at Week 52, in the rituximab stratum, 84.1% of subjects in the comparator arm had BVAS = 0 
vs. 88.8% in the avacopan arm.  
The applicant also included tables regarding remitters and non-remitters by reason causing non-
remission as is shown below.

Glucocorticoid toxicity index 
The glucocorticoid toxicity index (GTI) was comprised of individual measurements including body mass 
index (BMI), glucose tolerance, blood pressure, lipids, steroid myopathy, skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric 
toxicity, and infection. Both a cumulative worsening score (CWS) and aggregate improvement score 
(AIS) were determined at both Week 13 and 26, see below.

The EuroQuality of Life-5 Domains-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic health-related quality of life 
instrument designed to capture overall quality of life. Two scores are calculated, the first based on a 
visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 and the second based on a population norm-based 
index. 
The findings of the EQ-5D-5L analyses are summarised here:

Time to relapse 
Relapse in ANCA-associated vasculitis was defined as the occurrence of at least one major BVAS item, 
at least 3 non-major items, or 1 or 2 non-major items on at least 2 consecutive visits after remission 
had been achieved. Two analyses were performed, the first in subjects who achieved remission at 
Week 26 and the second in subjects who achieved BVAS=0 at any time during the treatment period. 
The incidence of adjudicated relapse after remission had been achieved at Week 26 was 14 of 115 
subjects (12.2%) in the comparator group and 9 of 120 subjects (7.5%) in the avacopan group 
(P=0.081). The applicant also performed a post-hoc analysis on relapses over the entire duration of 
the study starting from the baseline. A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse from this post-hoc analysis 
is shown below.

Glucocorticoid use over the course of the study is shown below. There was a marked difference in GC 
use between study arms from baseline to Week 26; mainly due to the protocol-defined 20-week course 
of prednisone tapered down from an initial dose of 60 mg/d in the comparator group. The use of GCs 
was closely similar between study arms from end of Week 26 to Week 52.

Persistence of efficacy 
Phase 3 Study CL010_168 included an 8-week follow-up period. The number of subjects experiencing 
relapses during the follow-up period was similar between the two groups (7 in the comparator group 
compared to 6 in the avacopan group). 
Ancillary analyses 
Relevant ancillary analyses are described above. 
Summary of main study 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. This should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the 
benefit risk assessment.

For the two primary efficacy endpoints, the proportion of subjects achieving 
disease remission at Week 26 and sustained disease remission at Week 52 
were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure; the two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals for the difference in proportions (Avacopan minus control) 
will be greater than -0.20 for the non-inferiority and greater than 0.0 for the 
superiority.

The efficacy data from CL002_168, CL003_168 and CL010_168 have not been integrated, given the 
substantial differences in the primary efficacy endpoints, treatment regimens, and the treatment

Supportive studies 
Two supportive Phase 2 clinical trials (CL002_168 and CL003_168) in 109 patients with ANCA-
associated vasculitis (AAV) were conducted evaluating the efficacy and safety of avacopan for AAV. 
Phase 2 study CL002_168: Clinical trial CL002_168 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of avacopan in subjects with newly-
diagnosed or relapsing active ANCA-associated vasculitis when administered in combination with 
guideline recommended immunosuppressants, cyclophosphamide or rituximab (Yates et al., 2016). 
The primary efficacy objective was improvement from baseline in the BVAS of at least 50% with no 
worsening in any organ system. The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of avacopan in subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis receiving cyclophosphamide or 
rituximab treatment. 
Subjects were randomised to one of three treatment groups: 
•  The full-dose comparator group: subjects received avacopan-matched placebo plus 
cyclophosphamide or rituximab and the full starting dose (60 mg per day) of 
prednisone 
•  The avacopan + low-dose comparator group: subjects received avacopan 30 mg twice 
daily plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab plus a one-third starting dose (20 mg per 
day) of prednisone  
•  The avacopan + no comparator group: subjects received avacopan 30 mg twice daily 
plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab plus prednisone-matching placebo 
Cyclophosphamide was administered at 15 mg/kg (up to 1.2 g) IV every 2 to 4 weeks and rituximab at 
375 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 12 weeks, with a subsequent 12-week 
follow-up period. Results for the primary efficacy endpoint, BVAS response, is shown in table below.

Analysis of Clinical Remission Based on Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score at Day 85 – ITT Population 
in study CL002_168 
Phase 2 study CL003_168: The Phase 2 study CL003_168 enrolled 42 patients with active ANCA-
associated vasculitis to evaluate the safety of avacopan when given on top standard of care treatment, 
consisting of glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Study CL003_168 was a prospective, 
randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate safety in the 
target population. Treatment duration was 12 weeks, with a subsequent 12-week follow-up period. All 
patients received high dose steroids, and the study does not provide any supportive efficacy data for 
the proposed dose regimen.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Avacopan is intended in combination with a cyclophosphamide or rituximab regimen for the treatment 
of adult patients with active, severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA). Three clinical studies have been included in support of this claim; two phase 2 studies 
(CL002_168 and CL003_168) including a total of 109 patients, and one pivotal phase 3 study 
(CL010_168) including 331 patients. The first study, CL002_168, met its primary endpoint as 
avacopan, with or without reduced dose of prednisone, was non-inferior to the comparator (full dose 
prednisone) regarding BVAS response at day 85. There were, however, uncertainties regarding the 
statistical analyses affecting the reliability of these results. After 12 weeks of follow-up, the response 
rate for both avacopan groups was inferior to the comparator, questioning the efficacy of avacopan 
over time. There was also a concern on the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint, as there is a 
general consensus that the aim of vasculitis induction therapy is not the induction of response, but 
rather the induction of remission. For the secondary endpoint of BVAS remission, avacopan with or 
without low-dose prednisone appeared inferior to the comparator. The second phase 2 study, 
CL003_168, was primarily a safety study and did not provide additional supportive efficacy data for the 
proposed avacopan dose regimen.  
Phase 3 study, CL010_168 
CL010_168 was a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical study assessing the efficacy and 
safety of avacopan in subjects with newly diagnosed or relapsing active ANCA-associated vasculitis 
when administered against a standard background cyclophosphamide or rituximab regimen. The study 
Assessment report  
Page 70/109 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment period was 52 weeks with an 8-week follow-up period. Eligible patients had a clinical 
diagnosis of GPA or MPA consistent with the well-established Chapel-Hill Consensus Conference 
definitions, were 12 years and above and had positive anti-PR3 or anti-MPO antibodies. Patients 
needed to have active disease defined by at least one major item, or at least 3 minor items, or at least 
the 2 renal items of proteinuria and haematuria in the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) and 
a clinical need for treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Hence, mild cases were excluded. In 
addition, subjects with very severe AAV requiring invasive pulmonary ventilation support due to 
alveolar haemorrhage or with dialysis or plasma exchange with 12 weeks prior to screening were 
excluded. Therefore, the study participants did not represent the entire spectrum of AAV, as subjects 
with mild disease and, on the other hand, subjects with severe progressive disease were excluded. 
Acknowledged are the limitations in the study design which hinder the non-inferiority assessment. One 
issue is that the primary endpoint was assessed at Week 26, even though the other medications in the 
induction treatment combinations had ended prior to Week 26 whereas avacopan was continued. 
Rituximab ended after 4 weekly injections, prednisone taper in the comparator arm continued up to 
Week 20, and cyclophosphamide ended after Week 15 (IV until week 13, oral until week 15), when it 
was substituted by azathioprine or mycophenolate. Especially in the comparator arms, treatment 
response may have started to decrease after cessation of induction therapies, which might favour the 
avacopan group. Efficacy and safety results are affected also by use of non-study defined 
glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants in this setting. Consequently, the magnitude of the 
contribution of avacopan to the observed efficacy is difficult to quantify. 
The originally proposed indication was: “Tavneos is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).” 
In the clinical studies, avacopan was administered in combination with rituximab or cyclophosphamide 
(followed by azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). This was raised as a major issue by the CHMP. In 
response, the applicant revised the indication to include information on the combination with rituximab 
or  cyclophosphamide,  and  to  include  that  only  patients  with  severe,  active  disease  are  eligible  for 
therapy. The treatment duration was 12 months and there are no data available for long-term treatment: 
“Tavneos, in combination with a rituximab or cyclophosphamide regimen, is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA) (see section 4.2).” 
Patients with severe life- or organ-threatening disease such as alveolar haemorrhage requiring invasive 
pulmonary ventilation support, and patients with GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or in need of dialysis or 
plasma exchange were excluded from the study. Consequently, section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated 
on request of the CHMP to adequately reflect that there are no data in patients with GFR <15 
mL/minute/1.73 m2 or in need of dialysis.  
The Chapel-Hill Consensus Conference definitions include histopathological signs of necrotising 
vasculitis. The applicant was asked to confirm that the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy in all 
patients and summarise from which organs these biopsies were taken. The applicant clarified that the 
diagnosis of AAV in the pivotal study was based on a positive test for antibodies against either PR3 or 
MPO, and that a biopsy was not mandatory for patients to be included in the pivotal study. Renal 
biopsy results at baseline were available for a total of 80 subjects (48.8%) and 79 subjects (47.6%) in 
the prednisone and avacopan groups, respectively. 
According to the “EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated 
vasculitis”, “Histopathological evidence of vasculitis, such as pauci-immune glomerulonephritis or 
necrotising vasculitis in any organ, remains the gold standard for diagnostic purposes”. Although the 
Assessment report  
Page 71/109 
 
 
 
 
 
lack of diagnostic biopsy is considered to be a limitation of the study, the issue is not considered 
meaningful to be further pursued at this stage.  
 Patients were randomised to one of two treatment groups: 
•  Comparator group: full starting dose of prednisone (60 mg/day (if ≥ 55 kg) or 45 mg/day (if 
<55 kg)), followed by prednisone tapered according to a pre-specified protocol to reach 10 mg 
at day 71, 5 mg at day 99 and 0 mg at day 141.  
•  Avacopan group: avacopan 30 mg twice daily  
It should be noted that, according to the protocol, steroids were allowed also in the avacopan group. 
All patients received background treatment with standard of care with either rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV 
once weekly over 4 weeks or cyclophosphamide (oral or IV) for ~14 weeks followed by azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil. The induction and maintenance doses of cyclophosphamide and azathioprine 
are in line with the EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated 
vasculitis. Regarding rituximab, however, the applicant states that the dose of 375 mg/m2 IV once 
weekly over 4 weeks was based on the approved rituximab label at the time of initiating of the trial. 
However, in 2018, rituximab was approved also for maintenance treatment and hence, the applicant 
was asked to comment on this, and whether patients in the rituximab stratum can be considered sub-
optimally treated beyond 6 months. In their response, the applicant clarified that RTX was dosed 
according to the Mabthera SmPC at time of study start, when Mabthera was only approved for 
induction treatment, and that one of the goals of the ADVOCATE study was to evaluate whether 
avacopan (as monotherapy) could sustain remission at Week 52. The applicant’s comment that there is 
no general consensus about RTX use in the maintenance setting is not completely agreed on. The 
SmPC for Mabthera includes a clear recommendation on 500 mg IV infusions every 6 months up to at 
least 24 months, which is also reflected in the EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations.  
Thus, for maintenance of remission after induction treatment, the comparison in the rituximab stratum 
was between avacopan and placebo. Nonetheless, it is agreed that the results for avacopan in the RTX 
stratum, where RTX treatment was limited to 4 weekly infusions, are compelling and that remission 
achieved with induction with RTX seems to be sufficiently maintained by avacopan in monotherapy. 
Maintenance of remission was achieved by a higher proportion of patients treated with 
avacopan/rituximab, than in all other treatment groups.  
In the cyclophosphamide stratum, however, avacopan combined with azathioprine (or mycophenolate) 
was compared with azathioprine (or mycophenolate) alone. Therefore, in the cyclophosphamide 
stratum, also the comparator arm received maintenance treatment (with azathioprine or 
mycophenolate). Nevertheless, also in this stratum, the comparison of sustained remission was in 
practice between avacopan and placebo, since these were the treatments combined with azathioprine 
or mycophenolate.  
In the protocol assistance, the CHMP considered there was a risk that the steroid dose in the control 
arm was suboptimal. Following this, the applicant suggested to add criteria to the protocol allowing 
more corticosteroids to patients in need of more, which has been implemented. Although the steroid 
dosing in the comparator arm is largely in line with the EULAR recommendation and patients were 
given extra steroids as rescue if needed, the applicant was asked to further justify that subjects in the 
prednisolone arm were not sub-optimally treated. A clear summary of the glucocorticoid regimens used 
in other clinical trials in AAV was presented, and it was noted that the steroid tapering regimen in the 
ADVOCATE study is very similar to the tapering regimens used in the other trials. It is agreed with the 
applicant that patients in the control group in the ADVOCATE study were adequately treated with 
glucocorticoids.

Prior to randomisation, subjects were stratified according to three standard treatments: IV rituximab, 
IV cyclophosphamide, or oral cyclophosphamide, selection of treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator. After stratification, subjects were randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to receive prednisone 
according to a tapering plan + avacopan-matching placebo or avacopan + prednisone-matching 
placebo. Randomisation was performed centrally via an IRT system and minimisation algorithm, using 
the stratification factors: 1) IV rituximab, IV cyclophosphamide, or oral cyclophosphamide use; 2) anti-
PR3 or anti-MPO ANCA-associated vasculitis, and 3) newly diagnosed or relapsed disease.  
The study included two primary endpoints: 1) disease remission at week 26, and 2) sustained disease 
remission at week 52. Disease remission was defined as BVAS of 0, no glucocorticoids within 4 weeks 
prior to the timing of the endpoint, and no BVAS >0 during the 4 weeks prior to Week 26 (if collected 
for an unscheduled assessment). Additionally, to fulfil sustained remission, no relapse was allowed 
between week 26 and 52. BVAS remission and off steroids is a clinically relevant endpoint and has 
been widely used in previous clinical trials. The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a 
gatekeeping procedure to preserve the overall Type 1 error rate at the 5% level, according to the 
following sequence: (1) non-inferiority at Week 26, (2) non-inferiority at Week 52, (3) superiority at 
Week 52, and (4) superiority at Week 26. The non-inferiority margin was -20%.  
The primary endpoint definition at week 26 was endorsed by the CHMP; however, the CHMP requested 
that patients were treated and followed for 52 weeks to evaluate also the duration of remission, and 
that the primary efficacy endpoint was only considered to be achieved if patients have both been off 
steroids and had a BVAS score of 0 for the past 4 weeks. 
The definition of the second primary endpoint (sustained remission at week 52) is very close to what 
was requested from the CHMP and is considered highly clinically relevant. Hence, the deviation from 
the CHMP advice is not considered to have relevantly affected the obtained results. 
The NI margin is considered wide, and a 20% difference in response rates would unlikely be considered 
not clinically meaningful. The NI margin has been discussed at a previous Scientific Advice and the CHMP 
recognised  the  limitations  related  to  a  narrower  margin,  in  particular  related  to  a  study  with  ~900 
patients. Hence, the study was planned with a NI margin of 20% and the assessment is based on the 
totality of data. 
Important secondary endpoints were glucocorticoid toxicity index, BVAS remission at week 4, quality of 
life assessments, proportion of subjects with and time to relapse, change in eGFR, reduction of 
proteinuria, and change in vasculitis damage index. 
None of the secondary endpoints in study CL010_168 were multiplicity controlled.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 331 patients were enrolled and randomised in the study, whereof 330 were included in the 
ITT population (prednisone n=164, avacopan n=166). The proportion of patients discontinuing study 
drug due to AEs was relatively high: 17.6 % in the comparator group and 15.7 % in the avacopan 
group. It is unclear how patients discontinuing study medication were handled in the primary analysis 
due to the differences of the definition of non-responder given in the SAP, CSR and SCE. Missing data 
was imputed as non-remission in the ITT analysis, and protocol deviations were imputed as non-
remission in the PP analysis. The applicant provided tipping point analyses for missing data and study 
discontinuation; these results were robust. The applicant also provided more detailed information on 
imputation of data in the PP populations for intercurrent events such as immunosuppressant use OR 
non-compliance. In the PP analysis 109/161 in the comparator group and 110/162 in the avacopan 
group had disease remission at for week 26. Immunosuppressant use and non-compliance were coded 
Assessment report  
Page 73/109 
 
 
 
 
as non-remission in this non-inferiority analysis. The applicant has provided a comprehensive 
description of coding of these intercurrent events. There was some numerical difference in between the 
treatment and control group at week 26, primarily driven by non-compliance imputation, 8 in the 
avacopan group and 4 in the control (Prednisone) group. This difference was however to a 
disadvantage for the avacopan group. Remission Status changed from Yes to No due to IS use OR 
non-compliance imputation in 9 for the Avacopan group and 6 for the control group. Since the 
discrepancy between these numbers is larger than the discrepancy in the total numbers for the PP 
analysis, and to the disadvantage of the avacopan group, it should not have masked differences 
between groups. The applicant claims that patients who discontinued treatment or study did not do 
well clinically. However, according to the CSR, adverse events seem to be a common reason as well.  
The mean age of the patients was ~60 years, and the majority were of Caucasian ethnicity. A total of 
70% were newly diagnosed. Around 55% had a diagnosis of GPA and 45% had a diagnosis of MPA, 
which was balanced across the groups. The proportion of male subjects was slightly higher in the 
avacopan group (59%) than in the comparator group (53.7%), but the difference is not considered to 
be clinically meaningful. The most frequent induction treatment agent was rituximab (65% in both 
groups). The remaining patients received either oral or IV cyclophosphamide. At baseline, the 
proportion of subjects with prior glucocorticoid use was higher in the comparator group compared with 
avacopan (82.3% versus 75.3%). This is somewhat unexpected in a randomised trial. The applicant 
was asked to clarify and explain in detail the root cause for the difference and whether there is a 
systemic error in the reporting and analysis of concomitant medications or whether there is an issue 
related to randomisation. Furthermore, the applicant was asked to discuss the potential implication of 
the root cause on reporting of concomitant medications also during the treatment period and provide 
updated results as appropriate. Following the response evaluation, it was agreed that the noted 
numerical difference in prior GC use was a chance finding. However, 7% difference is not negligible 
and the difference may have affected the use of GC in the study arms during the study. At week 26, 
the difference in achieving remission at week 26 was 14% in the group not using GCs during screening 
in favour of the avacopan group. On the contrary, in subjects who used GCs during screening, the 
difference in achieving remission at Week 26 was 1.6% in favour of the control group. At week 52, 
sustained remission was also achieved by a slightly larger proportion of subjects not having used GCs 
during screening and belonging to the avacopan group vs. control group (13.5% vs. 9.1%) than in the 
majority having used GCs during screening. Hence, GC use during screening may have partly masked 
the effect by avacopan during the first part of the trial. However, the issue was not pursued further. 
The first primary endpoint, BVAS remission at week 26, was achieved by 115 of 164 subjects (70.1%) 
in the comparator group compared to 120 of 166 subjects (72.3%) in the avacopan group. Non-
inferiority was met (estimate of common difference in percentages 3.4%, p<0.0001, 95% CI: -6; 
12.8). Avacopan was not statistically superior to prednisone (p=0.2387). 
The second primary endpoint, sustained BVAS remission at week 52, was achieved by 90 of 164 
subjects (54.9%) in the comparator group compared to 109 of 166 subjects (65.7%) in the avacopan 
group (estimate of common difference in percentages 12.5%, non-inferiority p<0.0001, 95% CI: 2.6; 
22.3). Both non-inferiority and superiority (p=0.0066) was met. 
The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure according to the 
following sequence: (1) non-inferiority at Week 26, (2) non-inferiority at Week 52, (3) superiority at 
Week 52, and (4) superiority at Week 26, and the difference for the first three analyses was thus 
statistically significant. The results were similar in the per protocol analyses. The results are considered 
clinically relevant.  
In the pre-defined subgroups of ANCA subtype (PR3 or MPO), newly diagnosed or relapsed disease, 
and disease subtype (GPA or MPA), the results were similar as in the primary analysis. For the second 
Assessment report

primary endpoint of sustained remission, the results in all subgroups were numerically in favour of 
avacopan. The efficacy of the treatment regimen including avacopan combined with rituximab was 
higher than the efficacy of the treatment regimen including avacopan combined with 
cyclophosphamide, both at week 26 and week 52. Furthermore, the safety profile seems more 
favourable in the rituximab stratum. This could partially be explained by the fact that choice of 
background therapy was made at the discretion of the investigator. This led to an imbalance in 
baseline characteristics, with patients with more severe vasculitis receiving treatment with CYC. 
Mixing of active and placebo and placebo only comparators after the induction treatment regimens in 
the rituximab and cyclophosphamide strata compromise interpretation of the joint treatment effect 
estimate; especially since the obtained results in the two strata were different: the observed 
superiority in the joint analysis was driven by the rituximab stratum.  
The efficacy of avacopan in combination with AZA in terms of promoting maintenance of achieved 
vasculitis remission does not seem impressive when compared to the efficacy of AZA alone in the later 
parts of the study, i.e. adding avacopan to azathioprine or mycophenolate did not seem to increase the 
proportion of patients who manage to remain in remission until Week 52. Hence, the decisions 
regarding efficacy in the cyclophosphamide stratum were based on results on secondary endpoints. 
Most importantly, the reduction in cumulative steroid dose between the active and control arms is 
considered clinically meaningful. Also, considering the limited treatment options in patients with AAV, it 
might be beneficial to have an alternative to prednisone with a different safety profile.  
The efficacy was overall consistent across subgroups of race, age and sex. 
Secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity.  
The glucocorticoid toxicity index (GTI) was comprised of individual measurements including body mass 
index (BMI), glucose tolerance, blood pressure, lipids, steroid myopathy, skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric 
toxicity, and infection. The applicant provided a literature review considered adequate for verification 
of clinical usefulness of the GTI. The measure is relatively new, with only 3 published trials to date 
using the score. It is however agreed that the cited literature and the results of the study CL010_168 
overall support the potential of GTI to reflect GC related toxicity. Even though the MCID of GTI in AAV 
is not known, the results are deemed clinically relevant. The GTI was only followed up to Week 26. 
However, the GC use after Week 26 was similar in the avacopan and comparator arms in the RTX 
stratum, and the slightly higher CG use in the comparator arm of the CYC stratum is small. Hence, the 
GTI would not be likely to differ from Week 26 to 52. For the secondary endpoint of BVAS 0 at week 4, 
avacopan was numerically inferior to prednisone. This could be due to a more rapid effect of 
prednisone.  
Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) changes were assessed based on the Medical Outcomes Survey 
Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) and EuroQuality of Life-5 Domains-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) in the 
avacopan group compared to the comparator group. The HRQoL increased markedly in both treatment 
arms during the study, and the differences in improvement between arms were small. Based on SF-
36v2, the avacopan arm of the study had statistically significantly better results on the SF-36-PCS 
score at 52 weeks and already at 26 weeks; but not in the SF-36 MCS. However, there were in both 
PSC and MCS individual domains with better result in the avacopan arm compared with the prednisone 
arm of the study. The results on the total SF-36v2 score were submitted by the applicant upon 
request. An improvement of 11.4 at Week 26 and 13.7 at Week 52 was observed in the avacopan arm 
from a baseline of 56.7. In the comparator arm, the increase was slightly lower:  7.2 at Week 26 and 
9.5 from a baseline of 55.8. The results were overall similar in the RTX and CYC/AZA strata. 
At the predefined primary analysis time point (change from baseline to 52 weeks), the improvement in 
HRQoL as measured by the EQ-5D-5L was larger in the avacopan group than in the comparator group. 
Assessment report  
Page 75/109 
 
 
 
 
At 26 weeks, the difference was not yet significant between the study arms. The applicant was in day 
120 LoQ requested to discuss the clinical relevance of the results and provide the MCID for EQ-5D-5L 
and VAS. Based on the response, EQ-5D-5L increased markedly during the study in both study arms, 
however, the differences between avacopan and comparator arms were minor even though in favour of 
avacopan, and similar in both RTX and CYC strata of the study. The differences between study arms in 
the change from baseline to Week 52 in the EQ-5D-5L VAS were 4.7 in the RTX stratum and 7.9 in the 
CYC stratum from the baseline values of 63.2 and 64.6 in the RTX stratum and 63.7 and 67.9 in the 
CYC stratum. 
The incidence of relapse after remission had been achieved at Week 26 was numerically higher in the 
comparator group (14 of 115 subjects, 12.2%) than in the avacopan group (9 of 120 subjects, 7.5%). 
Furthermore, the applicant’s post-hoc analysis on time to relapse over the entire study duration 
favours avacopan-containing regimens compared to the comparator regimens. The difference in time 
to relapse is mostly achieved prior to Week 26 but maintained thereafter. 
In patients with renal disease, the mean increase from baseline to week 52 was 4.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 
the comparator group and 7.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the avacopan group. This difference in eGFR of 
around 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 between the study arms is small taking in account baseline of 56.6 
ml/min/1.73 m2 in the RTX stratum and 42.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the CYC/AZA stratum. Mean reduction 
of proteinuria was numerically slightly larger for prednisone (-77) than for avacopan (-74), however, 
also this difference is small. It should be noted that the secondary endpoints on relapse and on change 
in eGFR were not conducted between randomised groups, since relapses were only compared between 
subjects with initial remission and change in eGFR only between subjects who had renal disease at 
baseline.  
Regarding vasculitis damage index, both treatment groups showed a similar mean increase in LSM 
change in VDI from baseline to Week 52 (1.17 in the avacopan group and 1.15 in the comparator 
group). 
As expected, the cumulative steroid dose was by far higher in the comparator group than in the 
avacopan group (3846.9 mg versus 1675.5 mg, respectively). However, it needs to be highlighted that 
a significant amount of steroids was actually needed also in the avacopan group. During the procedure, 
concern was raised on a potential interaction between avacopan and prednisone. Following the 
applicant’s response, it was concluded that there is no clinically significant interaction and that the 
difference in cumulative steroid dose corresponds to a “true” steroid-sparing effect of avacopan. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  52-week  results  demonstrate  overall  statistical  superiority  of  the  avacopan  regimens 
compared with the so-called “prednisone arm”. The results are driven by the numerical superiority in the 
rituximab stratum. Although a cautious approach is warranted when interpreting the outcome of efficacy 
data from subgroup analyses, the benefit of avacopan in combination with CYC/AZA/MMF, in terms of 
promoting  sustained  disease  remission,  seems  more  limited  as  compared to the  benefit  of  combining 
avacopan with RTX. Rather, clinical value dependent on other benefits than remission must be shown. 
It is agreed with the applicant that some of the secondary endpoints provides some further support for 
the efficacy of avacopan, however the lack of control for type 1 error hampers full reliability of these 
results. The most important support for the efficacy of avacopan in this stratum is its steroid-sparing 
effect. 
Taken together, the efficacy of avacopan in combination with rituximab is considered established. 
Although the efficacy of avacopan in combination with AZA is not fully impressive when compared to 
the efficacy of AZA alone in the later parts of the study in terms of sustained remission, the reduction

in cumulative steroid dose is still considered clinically meaningful supporting efficacy of avacopan in 
both strata. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Subject Enrolment by Study in the Avacopan Clinical Study Programme 
In the seven Phase I clinical trials, all subjects were healthy volunteers, except for study CL013_168, 
in which mild or moderate impairment of liver function was studied. Avacopan doses up to 100 mg 
twice daily have been tested in Phase 1 studies, with the longest duration of dosing being 17 days. 
Overall, in the avacopan clinical study programme (as of 24 March 2020), 482 subjects received at 
least one dose of avacopan. Of the 239 subjects received avacopan in the phase II and phase III 
vasculitis studies, 226 were exposed to the proposed dose of 30 mg BID. 
The main focus of the safety assessment is placed on the relatively large 52-week phase III study. In 
this study, subjects were randomised to either avacopan 30 mg x 2 (n=166) or full starting dose of 
Assessment report  
Page 77/109 
 
 
 
 
  
prednisone (n=165 randomised, 164 in the Safety population). Both treatments were given on top of 
cyclophosphamide→ azathioprine or rituximab.  
Supportive clinical safety data for this application comes from the two phase II studies. Treatment 
duration was 12 weeks+12-week follow-up. In these studies, different background therapy and 
avacopan doses were explored.  Patients in the control groups of both the phase II studies (n=23 in 
study CL002_168 and n=13 in study CL003_168) received full SOC treatment (i.e. placebo plus a full 
starting dose of 60 mg prednisone + either cyclophosphamide→ azathioprine or rituximab). In the 
phase II study CL003_168, patients in the active group received either 10 mg x 2 (n=13) or 30 mg x2 
(n=16) avacopan on top of full SOC (including full starting dose of steroids). In contrast, in study 
CL002_168, patients in the active group received 30 mgx2 avacopan on top of reduced SOC; either 
with reduced starting dose of 20 mg prednisone per day (n = 22 subjects) or no prednisone (n = 22).  
Pooling of data: The safety data sets from the Phase 2 clinical studies in ANCA-associated vasculitis 
were pooled and summarised separately to support the Phase 3 data to complement the safety data 
set for the target patient population. In addition, descriptive analysis of the Phase 1 studies and Phase 
2 studies in other indications is available. Pooling of the two Phase 2 studies and the Phase 3 study 
was performed to evaluate the exposure-adjusted rate of all deaths, serious adverse events, 
withdrawal of study medication due to adverse events, and events of interest (infections, hepatic 
enzyme abnormalities, WBC count decreases (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and hypersensitivity 
events. The Safety Population in the Phase 3 study CL010_168 included all subjects who were 
randomised and received at least one dose of study medication in the study. Safety Population in 
Phase 2 studies in AAV includes all subjects who were randomised and received at least one dose of 
study medication in either study CL002_168 or CL003_168. 
Adverse events 
An overview of AEs reported in the Phase III study CL010_168 is presented in the table below. A total 
of 1779 TEAEs were reported by 164 subjects (98.8%) in the avacopan group while a total of 2139 
TEAEs were reported by 161 subjects (98.2%) in the comparator group. There were in total 166 SAEs 
in the comparator group reported in 74 subjects (45.1%) and 116 SAES in the avacopan group 
reported in 70 subjects (42.2%) in the phase III study. 
Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in the phase III Study CL010_168 (Safety Population) 
An overview of AEs in the Phase II study pool (based on CL002_168 and CL003_168) is presented in 
the table below. In the phase II data, 311 TEAEs were reported in the comparator group and 556 
TEAEs in the avacopan group. There were 13 SAEs in the comparator group and 34 SAEs in the 
avacopan group.

Overview Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Phase II Studies in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis 
(Pooled Safety Population) 
Only one of the clinical studies (CL003_168) investigated multiple doses and this study investigated 
only two doses. Numerically more SAEs were observed in the higher dose group vs the low dose group 
and for events belonging to the following SOCs: general disorders and administration site conditions, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue, skin and subcutaneous tissue, cardiac and endocrine. Both in 
phase II and phase III, the SOC with the highest subject incidence in the avacopan treated subjects 
were Infections and Infestations and Gastrointestinal Disorder. See below table for phase III that 
summarizes TEAEs by SOC reported in ≥5% of subjects in either treatment group.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class in the Phase III Study CL010_168 (Safety 
Population) 
In the Phase III study, nausea was the most frequently reported TEAE in the avacopan group. 
Peripheral oedema was the most frequently reported TEAE in the comparator group. Those TEAEs with 
a subject incidence ≥2% higher in the avacopan group compared with the comparator group for TEAEs 
≥5% in either treatment group were nausea, headache, vomiting, and rash. Nausea and vomiting were 
reported predominantly in subjects in the cyclophosphamide stratum.  
Incidences of TEAEs possibly related to avacopan/matching placebo were 103 subjects (62.8%) in the 
comparator group compared with 100 subjects (60.2%) in the avacopan group. In addition, prior to 
unblinding, all TEAEs were reviewed to identify those considered possibly related to glucocorticoid use 
based on European League Against Rheumatism-recommended search terms. The incidence of TEAEs 
considered possibly related to glucocorticoid use was 80.5% in the comparator group compared with 
66.3% in the avacopan group. A higher subject incidence in the comparator group compared with the 
avacopan group was observed for AEs of weight increased, insomnia, hyperlipidaemia, adrenal 
insufficiency, increased blood glucose, and irritability.  
Potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs): The following methodology was applied to identify potential 
ADRs based on: the incidence or rate of events compared with the control group; biologic plausibility; 
clinical impressions of individual cases; statistical assessment of the strength and magnitude of the 
Assessment report

observed effect; dose relationship (limited because most subjects received 30 mg avacopan twice 
daily); event severity; consistency of findings across studies; consistency of findings from similar 
events; consistency of findings from similar compounds (limited because avacopan is the only member 
of its class); and clinical relevance. In addition, all TEAEs were reviewed in a stepwise manner to 
identify potential ADRs based on their incidence and the relative incidence in the comparator group and 
whether it was a pre-specified event of interest i.e. infection, increase in liver function tests, decrease 
in WBC count [neutropenia and lymphopenia], and hypersensitivity/angioedema. 
The ADRs, as classified by the applicant, are summarised under the following headings as well as data 
for Infections, Low WBC and Cardiac manifestations that were viewed as items that could also be 
considered for inclusion as ADRs. 
Liver function test increased (proposed ADR): There were exclusion criteria and suspension of 
medication-criteria with regards to deranged liver tests in the clinical studies. Both AEs of hepatic 
function test and SAEs of hepatic function test were more frequent in the avacopan group vs the 
steroid group in the pooled phase II/phase III data and in the phase III data, please refer to table 
below. 
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Associated with Elevated Hepatic Function Tests by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term in the phase III Study CL010_168 (Safety Population) 
Of the 22 subjects in the avacopan group with any liver function test AE, 7 discontinued study 
medication (1 had an interruption and then discontinuation) and 2 subjects interrupted their study 
medication as a result of the liver function test AE. The time to onset of liver function test AEs was 
within 4 days of treatment onset in 1 subject, within 5 to 90 days of treatment onset in 15 subjects, 
and more than 90 days after start of treatment in 6 subjects. The AEs resolved in all cases; the event 
was “ongoing” in 1 subject who subsequently died due to worsening of GPA. In 7 of the 22 cases, the 
event was considered as severe. Confounding factors were present in many of the cases.  
In response the CHMP’s request, it was clarified that AEs potentially representing signs or symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity are spread across multiple SOCs. In order to specifically investigate hepatotoxicity, the 
AEs of particular interest were assessed together as “hepatic events” irrespective of which SOC they 
coded to. The PTs reported in the study were pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan prior to 
unblinding and included drug-induced liver injury, hepatic function abnormal, hepatocellular injury, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood bilirubin

increased, blood bilirubin unconjugated increased, hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test 
abnormal, liver function test increased, transaminases increased, and hepatitis cholestatic. Using this 
definition, a total of 19 (11.6%) subjects in the comparator group and 22 (13.3%) subjects in the 
avacopan group experienced a hepatic event, see below figure which also displays the frequency in 
each background treatment stratum. 
Number of Subjects Experiencing Hepatic Disorder in different stratum 
Study medication was interrupted or discontinued in 3 of 6 cases of hepatic function test SAEs in the 
comparator group and 6 of 9 cases in the avacopan group in the phase III study. All events resolved. 
According to the CSR, none of the cases of liver enzyme elevations in the avacopan group met Hy’s law 
criteria. In both treatment groups, several of the subjects with SAEs of hepatic function tests had a 
documented increased bilirubin around the time of the event. In addition, in both treatment groups, 
several (but not all) of the subjects with SAEs of hepatic function tests had a documented increased 
ALP in relation to the event. One subject in each treatment group had elevated liver function tests at 
baseline. In the prednisolone group 2/6 subjects belonged to the cyclophosphamide stratum while 4/6 
belonged to the rituximab stratum. In the avacopan group, 6/9 belonged to the cyclophosphamide 
stratum (at least one of those received MMF) while 3/9 belonged to the rituximab stratum. The 
Hepatobiliary disorders SOC included 6 events in the avacopan group and 1 in the comparator group. 
In the avacopan group the PTs were: Hepatic function abnormal, Cholelithiasis, Drug-induced liver 
injury, Hepatitis, Hepatitis cholestatic and Hepatocellular injury. It is also reported that, in the phase 
III study, the incidence of hepatobiliary disorders leading to study medication discontinuation was 5 of 
166 subjects (i.e. 3.0%) in the avacopan group compared with none (0.0%) in the comparator group.  
Study medication was, according to the CSR, paused or discontinued permanently due to hepatic 
enzyme abnormalities in 5 subjects (3.0%) in the comparator group and 9 subjects (5.4%) in the 
avacopan group in the phase III study. 
Angioedema (proposed ADR): Two events of angioedema occurred in the phase III study in the 
avacopan group (2/166=1.2%) vs none in the comparator group (0/164=0.0%). In the first case, 
study medication was discontinued, anti-allergic treatment was given, and the event resolved without 
sequelae. In the second case, study medication was interrupted, and the event resolved. Study 
medication was then re-started, the angioedema did not recur, and the event was not considered 
related to study medication.

Overall, in this study, 70 subjects (42.7%) in the comparator group and 68 subjects in the avacopan 
group (41.0%) had any TEAEs of hypersensitivity. The majority of the hypersensitivity events were 
mild in severity.    
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased (proposed ADR): The incidence in the phase III study was 1 of 
164 subjects (0.6%) in the comparator group and 6 of 166 subjects (3.6%) in the avacopan group, 
please see table below.  No blood creatine phosphokinase increases were reported as SAEs in this 
study. No events of rhabdomyolysis or myositis were observed. There appeared to be no association 
between creatine phosphokinase increase and cardiac TEAEs, with no cardiac AEs observed at the time 
of creatine phosphokinase elevation in these subjects.

In the Phase II studies, 3 subjects in the avacopan group had TEAEs of increased blood creatine 
phosphokinase; none of the events were serious. 
Headache, Nausea, Vomiting (proposed ADR): These events were reported more often in the avacopan 
group vs the comparator group in the phase III study. The frequency for nausea among avacopan-
treated was 23.5%, for headache 20.5% and for vomiting 15.1%.  
Cardiac manifestations; cardiac failure: In the phase III study, there were 4 subjects in the avacopan 
group and no subjects in the comparator group in the phase III study with cardiac failure. The 
applicant states that the 4 subjects all had a medical history of cardiovascular disease and the 
incidence of serious major cardiovascular events was higher in the comparator group. Two SAEs each 
of angina pectoris and cardiac failure were observed in the avacopan group, see further below. The 
events related to the SOC cardiac disorders were overall somewhat more frequent in the avacopan

group vs the comparator group across the phase II and phase III studies. In addition, there were 
several cardiac SAEs in studies in other studied indications (unstable angina, cardiac asystole that 
resulted in deaths, atrial fibrillation). 
Infections: The incidence of infections in the phase III study is presented in the table below. 
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Infection in the phase III Study CL010_168 (Safety Population) 
Eleven subjects (6.7%) had serious opportunistic infections in the comparator group compared with 6 
subjects (3.6%) in the avacopan group. PTs of opportunistic infections in the avacopan arm included 
pneumonia (n=3) infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease, Campylobacter 
gastroenteritis and hepatitis B. In the phase III study, Otitis Media was reported with a frequency of 
0.6% in the comparator group and 2.4% in the avacopan group while Cellulitis was reported in 0.0% in 
the comparator group and 2.4% in the avacopan group. In the pooled phase II studies, the overall 
incidence of infection was 41.7% in the comparator group and 52.1% in the avacopan group. No 
Neisseria meningitidis infections were reported.  
Low White Blood Cell Count: Overall, the incidences of this event across the phase III and the phase II 
studies were generally not higher than in the comparator group i.e. the steroid group.  
In the phase III study, 39 subjects (23.8%) in the comparator group and 31 subjects (18.7%) in the 
avacopan group had TEAEs associated with low WBC count. A total of 8 subjects (4.9%) in the 
comparator group had serious TEAEs of neutropenia or lymphopenia compared with 4 subjects (2.4%) 
in the avacopan group; in all of these cases the event resolved, in 3 of the cases (2 comparator group 
and 1 in the avacopan group) treatment was interrupted or discontinued.  
Assessment report

However, in the phase II study, the incidence of Grade 3 lymphopenia was 23.3% in the avacopan 
group compared with 5.9% in the comparator group, but no Grade 4 lymphopenia events were 
observed in the Phase II studies. The higher incidence of Grade 3 lymphopenia seen in the avacopan 
treatment group in the Phase II studies is inconsistent with results from the Phase III study, where the 
incidence was similar for both groups (30.1% in the comparator group and 28.3% in the avacopan 
group). Moreover, the incidence of Grade 4 lymphopenia was higher in the comparator group in the 
Phase 3 study (8.0% vs. 2.4% in the avacopan group). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths: During the phase III study, 2 subjects (1.2%) in the avacopan group and 4 subjects (2.4%) in 
the comparator group died. In the avacopan group, the causes of death were GPA for 1 subject and 
pneumonia for the other. These 2 subjects were not receiving avacopan at the time of death. The two 
discontinuations occurred on Day 236 in one subject who died on Day 315 and on Day 50 in one 
subject who died on Day 160. In the comparator group the causes of death in the phase III study were 
diarrhoea, vomiting, and fungal infection; infectious pleural effusion; death of unknown cause; and 
acute myocardial infarction. 
Serious adverse events: The most common SAEs by SOC in the phase III study were Infections and 
Infestations, which occurred in 25 subjects (15.2%) in the comparator group and 22 subjects (13.3%) 
in the avacopan group. The only SOC with an SAE incidence of ≥2% in the avacopan group compared 
with the comparator group was Hepatobiliary Disorders (see above). Serious adverse events reported 
by ≥1% of subjects both treatment groups are presented in the table below.

In the phase III study, the most common SAE was anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive 
vasculitis (worsening), with 25 events reported in 20 subjects (12.2%) in the comparator group and 12 
events in 12 subjects (7.2%) in the avacopan group. When all preferred terms referring to vasculitis 
worsening were combined, i.e., anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive vasculitis/granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis, the incidence was higher in the comparator group, 23 of 164 
subjects (14.0%), compared to the avacopan group, 17 of 166 subjects (10.2%). The other most 
Assessment report

common SAEs in the avacopan group were pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and urinary tract infection. 
Regarding the cases of acute kidney injury or serum creatinine increase (3 in the comparator group 
and 4 in the avacopan group), all 7 cases resolved, none were considered related to study medication, 
and in all four cases in the avacopan group, the eGFR was similar or higher at the end of treatment 
compared to baseline. 
In the phase III study, 2 SAEs each of angina pectoris and cardiac failure were observed in the 
avacopan group, with none in the comparator group. With respect to the major cardiac AEs (defined as 
nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death) there were 3 in the 
comparator group compared with 1 in the avacopan group. There were two non-fatal myocardial 
infarction and one fatal myocardial infarction in the comparator group and one non-fatal myocardial 
infarction in the avacopan group. 
In an integrated analysis of subject incidence of all SAEs by SOC and PT in Phase II and III studies, the 
exposure-adjusted overall subject SAE incidence was 82 of 200 subjects (39.4%) in the comparator 
group and 94 of 239 subjects (39.9%) in the avacopan group. The overall SAE first incidence rate was 
60.1 per 100 subject-years in the comparator group and 61.6 per 100 subject-years in the avacopan 
group. The overall SAE event rate was 91.5 per 100 subject-years in the comparator group and 70.7 
per 100 subject-years in the avacopan group; the difference in event rate was -20.8 (95% CI -38.3, -
3.3). 
In the combined phase II study pool, SAEs were most commonly reported in the Infections and 
Infestations, Renal and Urinary Disorders, and Vascular Disorders SOCs. Serious adverse events 
reported in ≥2 subjects and with a >1% higher incidence in the avacopan group were respiratory tract 
infection, renal impairment, vasculitis, and increased C-reactive protein. 
No serious adverse events were observed among avacopan-treated subjects in the Phase I studies. 
Laboratory findings 
Decreases in mean leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts were noted both in 
phase III and phase II. Also, grade 3-4 severity shifts in lymphocyte counts occurred both in the 
avacopan group and the comparator group. Mean change from baseline in Liver Function Test 
Parameters in the avacopan group was, according to the applicant, overall consistent with the changes 
in the comparator group in the phase III study. Increases in creatine phosphokinase were noted in 
both treatment groups in the phase III study; however, the magnitude of these increases was greater 
in the avacopan group at several visits.  
In the phase III study, at baseline, both creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels (mean and median) 
were above the ULN for both treatment groups. For both parameters, decreases in mean and median 
values were observed over time and maintained for the duration of the study. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings and Other Observations in the phase II and phase III studies: Changes 
from baseline in vital sign parameters were generally similar for avacopan and control groups in the 
clinical studies. However, body mass index (BMI) appeared to increase more in the comparator group 
compared with the avacopan group in the phase III study and the phase II study CL002_168. In the 
phase III study, a total of 20 subjects had an abnormal ECG finding that were considered clinically 
significant during the study, comprising 8 subjects in the comparator group and 12 subjects in the 
avacopan group.  
Cardiovascular Safety: A thorough QT/QTc study, CL014_168, was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
therapeutic (30 mg twice daily) and supratherapeutic (100 mg twice daily) doses of avacopan on 
cardiac electrophysiology, including the QTc interval. This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo- 
Assessment report  
Page 88/109 
 
 
 
 
and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin), double-dummy, parallel-group, multiple-dose study in 58 
healthy subjects with a nested crossover comparison between avacopan, moxifloxacin, and placebo. 
Subjects in the avacopan cohort received 30 mg avacopan twice daily for 7 days, followed by 100 mg 
twice daily for another 7 days. Avacopan showed no clinically meaningful effects on cardiac 
repolarisation, i.e., QT/QTc intervals, or cardiac conduction.  
The primary ECG endpoint was change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF). Mean change-from-baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) on avacopan was according to the applicant similar to ΔQTcF on placebo on Days 1, 7, and 14, 
ranging across all 3 days from −5.5 to 3.5 ms on avacopan and from −6.9 to 1.4 ms on placebo. Mean 
placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (∆∆QTcF) across all 3 days ranged from −1.0 to 4.9 ms. The upper bound of 
the 90% CI of ∆∆QTcF was below 10 ms at all postdose time points on all days. After dosing with 400 
mg moxifloxacin, a clear increase of mean ∆∆QTcF was observed with a peak value of 15.8 ms (90% 
CI: 10.84 to 20.77) at 3 hours post-dose. 
There were no deaths or subject discontinuations due to AEs reported in the study. One subject in 
receiving avacopan placebo and moxifloxacin experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transverse 
myelitis.  The percentage of subjects reporting AEs was 38% following multiple supratherapeutic doses 
of avacopan and 21% following multiple therapeutic doses. No treatment- or dose-related trends were 
observed with respect to clinical laboratory, vital sign, ECG, or physical examination safety 
assessments. 
The potential effect of avacopan and its main metabolite CCX168-M1 on cardiac safety was also 
evaluated in 16 healthy volunteers in study CL007_168. The CSR concluded that there was no 
exposure-response relationship between CCX168, CCX168-M1, or CCX168 plus CCX168-M1 and QTcI 
observed in this study across a broad concentration range.  Overall, there were no remarkable 
observations in the categorical analysis and cardiodynamic ECG abnormalities were overall minimally 
reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The AE data from adult subjects by gender, age, race, renal function (eGFR), ANCA status, vasculitis 
stage (newly diagnosed vs. relapsing), vasculitis type (GPA vs. MPA), and hepatic function, in both the 
phase 2 and 3 studies were analysed and summarised. Avacopan is not recommended for subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (SmPC sec. 4.2), but no dose-adjustment is proposed with regards to renal 
function. The recommendations are based on PK-data from patients with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment and population PK analysis examining exposures in mild to severe renal impairment, 
please refer to PK-assessment. In the phase III study, there was an increasing trend with increasing 
age in the incidence of infections and infestations both in the avacopan and comparator groups. An 
increasing trend with increasing age was also noted for hepatobiliary disorders in the avacopan group 
(2.5% in those aged <65 years, 6.7% in those aged 65 to 74 years, and 15.4% in those aged ≥75 
years) but not in the comparator group (2.2%, 0.0%, and 4.0% respectively). A comprehensive 
presentation of the safety data in the elderly, summarised as per the standard table was not provided 
with the initial submission. Data is almost exclusively derived from adults.  
Regarding the race, in the phase III study, comparison of TEAE incidence by race was limited by the 
disparity in sample size between White and non-White subjects (>80% of all subjects enrolled in the 
Phase 3 study were White). Hepatic enzyme increase occurred in 0.0% (0/138) of White subjects vs. 
17.9% (5/28) of non-White subjects in the avacopan group compared with 2.9% (4/140) and 12.5% 
(3/24) respectively in the comparator group.

Extrinsic Factors 
With regards to Background Immunosuppressive Therapy, in the phase III study, the TEAE incidence 
across many SOCs was higher in the cyclophosphamide compared with the rituximab stratum for both 
treatment groups including Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders.  
For Infections and infestations, 76.3% of the subjects that received avacopan + cyclophosphamide had 
such event compared to 63.6% of subjects that received avacopan +rituximab. In the comparator 
group, 82.5% that received the combination with cyclophosphamide had such event compared to 
72.0% that received the combination with rituximab.  
The SOCs that had a ≥5% difference in subject TEAE incidence between the two strata in the avacopan 
group but did not show the same trend in the comparator group, included Cardiac disorders, and 
Hepatobiliary disorders.  
For cardiac disorders, the incidence was 25.4% in the cyclophosphamide vs. 10.3% in the rituximab 
strata in the avacopan group and 12.3% vs. 13.1% in the comparator group. Angina pectoris, cardiac 
failure, and palpitations appeared to be more common in the cyclophosphamide compared with the 
rituximab stratum in the avacopan group.  
Regarding Hepatobiliary disorders, the incidence was 10.2% in the cyclophosphamide vs. 3.7% in the 
rituximab strata in the avacopan group and 0.0% vs. 2.8% in the comparator group. 
The AEs potentially representing signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity are spread across multiple SOCs. 
In order to specifically investigate hepatotoxicity, the AEs of particular interest were assessed together 
as “hepatic events” irrespective of which SOC they coded to. Using this definition, a total of 19 
(11.6%) subjects in the comparator group and 22 (13.3%) subjects in the avacopan group 
experienced a hepatic event. Focusing on the CYC/AZA stratum, a total of 6 (10.5%) subjects in the 
comparator group and 12 (20.3%) subjects in the avacopan group experienced a hepatic event. In the 
Pred/RTX-stratum, 13 (12.1%) had such an event and in the avacopan/RTX stratum, 10 (9.3%) 
subjects had such event. 
Furthermore, in the phase II study studies, the TEAE incidence for many SOCs was higher in the 
cyclophosphamide compared with the rituximab stratum in both treatment groups. 
Analysis for SAE, AESI and discontinuations occurring during the first 20 Weeks (the period during 
which prednisone was administered to the prednisone control group) and during the weeks from week 
21 to the end of the phase IIII study was also performed. During the first 20 Weeks, the overall 
subject SAE incidence was 54 of 164 subjects (32.9%) in the comparator group and 49 of 166 subjects 
(29.5%) in the avacopan group. From week 21 to the End of Study, the overall subject incidence of 
SAEs was 44 of 164 subjects (26.8%) in the comparator group and 32 of 166 subjects (19.3%) in the 
avacopan group. During the First 20 Weeks, the overall subject incidence of discontinuation of study 
medication due to a TEAE was 19 of 164 subjects (11.6%) in the comparator group and 22 of 166 
subjects (13.3%) in the avacopan group. From Week 21 to the End of Study, the overall subject 
incidence of discontinuation of study medication due to a TEAE was 9 of 164 subjects (5.5%) in the 
comparator group and 5 of 166 subjects (3.0%) in the avacopan group. During the First 20 Weeks, the 
overall subject incidence of infection was 90 of 164 subjects (54.9%) in the comparator group and 82 
of 166 subjects (49.4%) in the avacopan group. From Week 21 to the End of Study, the overall subject 
incidence of infection was 86 of 164 subjects (52.4%) in the comparator group and 73 of 166 subjects 
(44.0%) in the avacopan group. During the First 20 Weeks, the overall subject incidence of hepatic 
test AEs was 13 of 164 subjects (7.9%) in the comparator group and 19 of 166 subjects (11.4%) in 
the avacopan group. From Week 21 to the End of Study, the overall subject incidence of hepatic test 
Assessment report  
Page 90/109 
 
 
 
 
AEs was 7 of 164 subjects (4.3%) in the comparator group and 4 of 166 subjects (2.4%) in the 
avacopan group. 
Avacopan is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception, as adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Immunological events 
Immunological events have not been reported by the applicant. This is acceptable as avacopan is not a 
biological medical product and issues with anti-drug antibodies are not foreseen. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pharmacokinetic safety related interactions have been discussed above. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the phase III study, the incidence of hepatobiliary disorders leading to study medication 
discontinuation was higher in the avacopan group (5 of 166 subjects i.e. 3.0%) compared with none 
(0.0%) in the comparator group. Integrated analysis of the subject incidence of TEAEs leading to study 
medication discontinuation in Phase II and III studies showed that the overall subject incidence of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study medication was 32 of 200 subjects (15.6%) in the 
comparator group and 35 of 239 subjects (14.9%) in the avacopan group. The overall incidence rate of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study medication (first incidence rate) was 18.0 per 100 subject-
years for the comparator group and 18.2 per 100 subject-years for the avacopan group, with a 
difference in rate of 0.2 (95% CI -8.4, 8.9). The overall rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study medication was 21.5 per 100 subject-years in the comparator group and 21.7 per 100 subject-
years in the avacopan group, with a difference in rate of 0.2 (95% CI -8.8, 9.2). 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable as avacopan was not authorised in any region at the time of this assessment. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
General features of the submitted safety data and exposure  
This application concerns a first-in-class, small molecule, C5aR inhibitor with the following currently 
intended indication: “Tavneos, in combination with a rituximab or cyclophosphamide regimen, is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) 
or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (see section 4.2).”  
The proposed posology is 30 mg twice daily taken as capsules. 
Inhibitors of C5 have been associated with an increased risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria, 
such as Neisseria meningitidis. However, avacopan does not significantly affect membrane attack 
complex formation, as claimed by the applicant.  
Regarding non-clinical data, no dose-limiting effects or target organ of toxicity were noted in the 
chronic studies and, therefore, the toxicology/safety of avacopan is not considered fully explored and 
will be further characterised in the post-marketing phase (PASS).  
Assessment report  
Page 91/109 
 
 
 
 
The human safety data to support the application derives from 7 Phase I studies, 2 Phase II studies 
(CL002_168 and CL003_168) and 1 Phase III study (CL010_168). The main focus of the safety 
assessment is placed on the relatively large 52-week phase III study. In this study, subjects were 
randomised to either avacopan 30 mg x 2 (n=166) or full starting dose of prednisone (n=165 
randomised, 164 in the Safety population). Both treatments were given on top of cyclophosphamide→ 
azathioprine or rituximab. Thus, this study compared SOC (full dose steroids) vs avacopan in the 
currently applied for posology.  
Supportive clinical safety data for this application comes from the two phase II studies. Treatment 
duration was 12 weeks+ 12-week follow-up. In these studies, different background therapy and 
avacopan-doses were explored.  Patients in the control groups of both the phase II studies (n=23 in 
study CL002_168 and n=13 in study CL003_168) received full SOC treatment (i.e. placebo plus a full 
starting dose of 60 mg prednisone + either cyclophosphamide→ azathioprine or rituximab). In the 
phase II study CL003_168, patients in the active group received either 10 mg x 2 (n=13) or 30 mg x2 
(n=16) avacopan on top of full SOC (including full starting dose of steroids). In contrast, in study 
CL002_168, patients in the active group received 30 mgx2 avacopan on top of reduced SOC; either 
with reduced starting dose of 20 mg prednisone per day (n = 22 subjects) or no prednisone (n = 22). 
The interpretation of the safety data from the phase II studies is thus limited by the fact that in: 1) 
some subjects in the active group received a lower avacopan dose that this application concerns and 2) 
many of the subjects in the avacopan groups of these studies also received scheduled doses of 
steroids. 
For the safety assessment it is important to note that all subjects in the phase II and phase III studies 
received either a background treatment with cyclophosphamide/azathioprine or rituximab. 
Cyclophosphamide is associated with myelosuppression, infections, urinary tract and renal toxicity as 
well as cardiotoxicity. Hepatoxicity is also among reported adverse reactions. Azathioprine is 
associated with bone marrow suppression, infections and hepatoxicity. Rituximab is associated with 
infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infusion related reactions and some cardiac disorders. It is 
further noted that in the phase III study, if azathioprine was not tolerated, mycophenolate mofetil or 
mycophenolate sodium may have been given instead. Similarly, in the phase II studies, after the initial 
cyclophosphamide treatment, mycophenolate mofetil or potentially also methotrexate or could have 
been used by subjects in case azathioprine was not tolerated. These medicinal products are also known 
to potentially affect the liver, cause cytopenias and an increased risk for infections. In the phase III 
study 44 patients used AZA in combination with avacopan, 15 subjects used mycophenolate mofetil 
and 2 subjects used mycophenolate sodium in combination with avacopan. Only very few subjects 
were treated with methotrexate and with mycophenolate as non-protocol specified medications. 
Overall, in the avacopan clinical study programme, 482 subjects received at least one dose of 
avacopan. Of the 239 subjects received avacopan in the phase II and phase III vasculitis studies, 226 
who were exposed to the proposed dose of 30 mg BID. Regarding 1-year exposure, the phase III trial 
was the only study with that length of exposure and in this study 166 patients were randomised to 30 
mg avacopan twice daily. Of those 166 subjects 37 subjects had early discontinuation of study 
medication and therefore, a total of 129 subjects completed the 52-week treatment period of the 
Phase 3 study. 
Exposure is limited and will affect the ability to capture less frequently occurring events but can be 
accepted given the rarity of this condition. Two further caveats should be noted: 
• 
• 
Patients with very severe disease were largely excluded from the clinical trials as well as 
patients with severe hepatic impairment.  This is reflected in the SmPC. 
The studies conducted to date are far too limited with regards to follow-up time and total 
exposure to provide any reassurance vid regards to the risk for malignancy. As this is not an 
Assessment report  
Page 92/109 
 
 
 
 
unreasonable concern considering the mechanism of action (and so far also without complete 
preclinical data addressing the issue), this is included as a safety concern (with expected 
latency) and addressed post-marketing and also reflected in the SmPC. There is a planned 
PASS, which will be conducted after the approval. 
Overview of Adverse Events and proposed ADRs 
In the phase III study, the subject incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and TAES leading to study medication 
discontinuation was similar in the avacopan group as compared to the comparator group. Also, in the 
phase II data, these incidences were similar, but the incidence of SAEs was numerically higher in the 
avacopan group as compared to the steroid group. The total number of TEAEs in the phase III study 
was higher in the comparator group as compared to the avacopan group: 2139 TEAEs vs 1779 TEAEs, 
as claimed by the applicant.  However, in the phase II data, the opposite was noted; 311 TEAEs were 
reported in the comparator group and 556 events in the avacopan group. A similar pattern was seen 
for SAEs. There were in total 166 SAEs in the comparator group and 116 SAEs in the avacopan group 
in the phase III study. In the phase II data, there were 13 SAEs in the comparator group and 34 SAEs 
in the avacopan group. Because of the limitations of the safety data derived from the phase II studies 
(as highlighted above) the data from the relatively large phase III study with longer duration will be 
given more weight.  
With the data provided, it is not straightforward to assess if the risks associated with avacopan are 
generally dose dependent. Only one of the clinical studies investigated two doses. It is noted that 
numerically more SAEs were observed in the higher dose group vs the low dose group and for events 
belonging to the following SOCs: general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue, skin and subcutaneous tissue, cardiac and endocrine. However, conclusions are 
hampered by the low number of subjects in the study and the heavy background treatment. 
It should be noted that there is no requirement to demonstrate fulfilment of an unmet need, such as a 
steroid-sparing effect leading to overall safety benefits (as compared to SOC). Nonetheless, the 
potential safety benefits of any steroid-sparing effect, is still a major area of interest. Steroids may, 
according to the phase III study protocol, be given also in the avacopan arm (subjects who 
experienced a relapse of their ANCA-associated vasculitis may have been treated with IV 
glucocorticoids and/or oral glucocorticoids, these subjects may have continued study drug treatment 
and were to continue in the study). In the clinical data, there were indeed indications of a decreased 
frequency of AEs typically attributed to steroids such as weight increase, insomnia, increased blood 
glucose in the avacopan group vs the steroid group.  
Both in phase II and phase III, the SOC with the highest subject incidence in the avacopan treated 
subjects were Infections and Infestations and Gastrointestinal Disorder. Based on these data, the 
applicant initially proposed that the following items should be listed as ADRs in the summary table in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC: Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Liver function test increased and Blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased and Angioedema (see further discussion below).  
Overall, since the numbers of subjects with TEAEs are overlapping between avacopan and comparator 
groups and as the comparator group is not a placebo group, omission of any ADRs from section 4.8 
based on lower frequency in the avacopan group as opposed to comparator group was not deemed 
acceptable by the CHMP. In response to the CHMP, the applicant reanalysed and provided a discussion 
of TEAEs occurring at >2%, and evaluated the possible causal relationship, between avacopan and the 
adverse events. The current presentation of the ADRs includes: all infections occurring in >2% of 
patients in the avacopan group, neutropenia, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain 
upper, liver function test abnormal, angioedema, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, leukopenia, 
and white blood cell count decreased, and is reflected in the SmPC.

Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of avacopan in this rare target indication, is considered acceptably characterised by 
the submitted safety data, in particular by the data from the relatively large 52-week phase III study. 
However, some concerns need to be followed post-marketing such as malignancy and infections. Thus, 
a robust post marketing follow-up is critical. There is a planned PASS, which the applicant agreed to 
conduct. 
From the currently available data it is apparent that: 1) a CYC/AZA/MMF-regimen in itself has a 
hepatotoxic potential (based on previous knowledge, which is reflected in current PIs of these drugs 
and to some extent confirmed by the data in the limited avacopan clinical dataset) and 2) that 
avacopan in itself has a hepatotoxic potential (based on data from the overall avacopan programme). 
Based on this, there seems to be a risk (which is also to some extent supported by data from the 
limited avacopan clinical dataset) that the additive effect of these drugs on the liver may further 
increase the risks as compared to when the drugs are given as monotherapy. In addition, knowing that 
avacopan is intended for a population that may also have additional factors that contribute to their risk 
for a hepatic injury, this will be monitored in the post-marketing setting (PASS, PSUR).  
However, the view of the CHMP is that the risks associated with avacopan-treatment, also in 
combination with a CYC/AZA/MMF-regimen, will be mitigated to an acceptable level by the currently 
proposed comprehensive SmPC wordings, see separate SmPC document. Further, the risks will be 
followed post-marketing. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
“Avacopan Real World Evidence in ANCA Associated Vasculitis”: Characterisation of the safety 
concerns of avacopan (i.e. liver injury, serious infections, malignancies and cardiovascular 
events) beyond the known safety profile based on clinical trial data limited to 52 weeks of 
exposure.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of avacopan with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. The CHMP, based on the available data, 
considers avacopan to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling (i.e. outer carton) for the purpose of providing statutory 
and additional information has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: link to a website (URL: 
www.tavneos-patient.eu) providing the package leaflet (statutory information) and a dose reminder 
card (additional information). 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tavneos (avacopan) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Assessment report  
Page 97/109 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tavneos is proposed “in combination with a rituximab or cyclophosphamide regimen, for the treatment 
of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA)”. 
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a multisystem autoimmune 
condition that occurs due to production of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. The disease is 
characterised by generalised inflammation of small to medium sized blood vessels that can affect many 
different organ systems but commonly involves the kidneys. The two main forms of the disease are 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).  
GPA can affect any organ or tissue but has a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory tracts and 
the kidneys, with >75% of patients having renal involvement that is associated with progressive 
glomerular nephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with ANCA positivity by immunofluorescence 
and positive testing for the proteinase 3 (PR3)-antigen. MPA can be distinguished from other forms of 
small vessel vasculitides by the absence of granuloma formation, and by the predominance of 
perinuclear ANCA staining by immunofluorescence and positive testing for the myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
antigen. If left untreated, 80% of patients with GPA or MPA die within 2 years of disease onset and 
mortality is higher for patients with renal involvement. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The basic principles of AAV treatment is: 
1.  Remission induction with potent immunosuppressive drugs 
followed by 
2.  Remission maintenance with less potent immunosuppressive drugs 
Cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids or rituximab plus glucocorticoids are considered the standard of 
care induction therapy for organ or life-threatening AAV. Maintenance treatment includes 
immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate. 
Glucocorticoid treatment is also often used during maintenance. Adjuvant treatment includes 
plasmapheresis in patients with severe progressive renal failure. Due to the serious side effects 
associated with current therapies, including glucocorticoids, there is a need for new therapeutic agents 
in AAV.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Key design features of the single pivotal trial (CL010_168) and the two supportive phase-II trials 
(CL003_168 and CL002_168) are described below: 
The pivotal study was a phase III, randomised, active-controlled study comparing avacopan (n=166) 
vs. prednisone (n=164) in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
vasculitis treated concomitantly with rituximab or cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal study CL010_168 
In the main clinical trial CL010_168, avacopan combined with IV rituximab or IV or oral 
cyclophosphamide was compared to standard treatment with a an oral 20-week regimen of prednisone 
starting from 60 mg daily and tapered to zero by Day 141 combined with IV rituximab or IV or oral 
cyclophosphamide. 
Primary endpoints: The study had two primary endpoints, both tested for non-inferiority and 
superiority. The first primary endpoint, non-inferiority in BVAS remission at week 26, was achieved by 
115/164 patients (70.1%) in the comparator group and 120/166 (72.3%) in the avacopan group (95% 
CI: -6.0, 12.8, p<0.0001 (non-inferiority) and 0.2387 (superiority)). The second primary endpoint, 
sustained remission at week 52, was achieved by 90/164 patients (54.9%) in the comparator group 
and 109/166 patients (65.7%) in the avacopan group (95% CI: 2.6, 22.3, p=<0.0001 (non-
inferiority), 0.0066 (superiority)).  
Assessment report  
Page 99/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints: None of the secondary endpoints were controlled for multiplicity. The incidence 
of relapse after remission had been achieved at Week 26 was numerically higher in the comparator 
group (14 of 115 subjects, 12.2%) than in the avacopan group (9 of 120 subjects, 7.5%). 
The proportion of patients using glucocorticoids beyond week 26 was 27.1% in the avacopan group vs 
39% in the comparator group. 
The glucocorticoid toxicity index (GTI) includes individual measurements including body mass index 
(BMI), glucose tolerance, blood pressure, lipids, steroid myopathy, skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric 
toxicity, and infection. Both a cumulative worsening score (CWS) and aggregate improvement score 
(AIS) were determined at both Week 13 and 26. At week 13, the Cumulative Worsening Score (GTI-
CWS) was  25.7 ± 3.40 (LSM ± SEM) in the avacopan group and 36.6 ± 3.41 in the comparator group. 
At week 26, the cumulative worsening score was 39.7 ± 3.43 in the avacopan group and 56.6 ± 3.45 
in the comparator group.  
The aggregate improvement score (GTI-AIS) was at week 13 9.9 ± 3.45 in the avacopan group and 
23.2 ± 3.46 in the comparator group. At week 26, the aggregate improvement score was 11.2 ± 3.48 
in the avacopan group and 23.4 ± 3.50 in the comparator group.  
Additional endpoints: The cumulative steroid dose was 3846.9 mg in the comparator group and 1675.5 
mg in the avacopan group. 
Relevant subgroups: In the pre-defined subgroups of background therapy (RTX or CYC), ANCA subtype 
(PR3 or MPO), newly diagnosed or relapsed disease, and disease subtype (GPA or MPA), the results for 
the first primary endpoint were similar as in the overall analysis. The response rate was higher in the 
rituximab stratum than in the cyclophosphamide stratum, in both treatment arms (RTX/predn: 75.7%, 
RTX/avacopan: 77.6%, CYC/predn: 59.6%, CYC/avacopan: 62.7%). For the second primary endpoint 
of sustained remission, the response rate in all subgroups were numerically higher for avacopan. The 
difference was most prominent in the rituximab stratum (RTX/predn: 56.1%, RTX/avacopan: 71.0%, 
CYC/predn: 52.6%, CYC/avacopan: 55.9%). 
The majority of subjects had renal disease at baseline: 95/135 and 99/134 subjects in the prednisone 
and avacopan groups, respectively. Of those with renal disease at baseline, subjects receiving 
avacopan showed a greater improvement in eGFR over the course of the 52-week treatment period. In 
the comparator group, change from baseline eGFR (mean 45.6 ml/min/1.73 m2) to Week 52 was 
4.1±1.03 (n=125); and in the avacopan group, change from baseline (mean 44.6 ml/min/1.73 m2) to 
Week 52 was 7.3±1.05 (n=119).  
Supportive studies 
The phase 2 studies included only a 12-week treatment period. This is too short for a reliable 
assessment of the remission-inducing efficacy. The remission rate was higher in the pivotal study 
(72% in BVAS remission at week 26) than in phase II study CL002_168 (19% in BVAS remission at 
week 12). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The exact effect size of avacopan is difficult to quantify because of the study design with background 
induction treatment and concomitant use of steroids in both treatment arms. The interpretation is 
further complicated by the different treatment regimens in the active and comparator arms and, in 
particular, the fact that the responses at week 26 were induced through different combination 
therapies.  
Assessment report  
Page 100/109 
 
 
 
 
It is not evident that remission at week 26 is the optimal, sensitive time point to demonstrate non-
inferiority between the active and control arms in response rates. Avacopan treatment was continued 
until week 26 whereas the other components of induction therapy were discontinued at weeks 4, 13 
(15) and 20 for RTX, CYC IV (oral) and prednisone, respectively. RTX and CYC where included in both 
arms; prednisone in the comparator arm. Furthermore, AZA maintenance therapy was started already 
at week 15 in the CYC stratum in both groups. For these reasons, interpretation of results at week 26 
is not straightforward as it is not evident which components of the treatment regimen have induced 
the observed responses.  
The week 52 endpoint measures sustained remission, that is, whether patients who were in response 
at week 26 are still in response at week 52. In the CYC stratum, patients received AZA in both arms 
and in the active arm avacopan in addition. In the RTX stratum, the comparator arm received placebo 
and the active arm avacopan. Superiority was demonstrated, mainly driven by the efficacy in the RTX 
stratum.  
The efficacy of the combination of avacopan with azathioprine was similar compared to azathioprine 
alone in maintaining remission after induction treatment with cyclophosphamide combined with 
avacopan or high-dose prednisone. Hence, the conclusion of efficacy of the avacopan regimen used in 
the cyclophosphamide stratum of the study at week 26 was based on non-inferiority, but the efficacy 
for sustained remission at week 52 had to be made based on other findings including secondary 
endpoints. The main basis for acceptance of the treatment regimen in the CYC stratum was the 
steroid-sparing effect by avacopan, which was mostly confined to first 26 weeks of the trial.  
Prior to Week 26, the difference is partly due to protocol-mandated prednisone course in the 
comparator arm, which is standard therapy. However, as glucocorticoids were allowed to be used 
according to need in both active and comparator arms, it is expected that GCs were used when needed 
in the avacopan group; therefore, the observed difference in glucocorticoid use is partly due to efficacy 
of avacopan. Additionally, some of the non-multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints support efficacy 
of avacopan also in this regimen, even if the noted benefit in, e.g., renal endpoints and PROs is small.  
It is noteworthy that the actual number of patients who relapsed between weeks 26 and 52 is very 
small across the strata and treatment arms, which brings some uncertainty to the sensitivity of the 
endpoints and duration of follow up and complicates the interpretation of results. In the CYC stratum, 
the number of relapses after Week 26 was even similar between active and comparator arms (3 in 
both arms). However, the applicant’s post-hoc analysis on relapses over the entire duration of the 
study shows a difference in relapses prior to Week 26 in favour of avacopan. Furthermore, there is no 
obvious reason to believe that the pharmacological effect of avacopan would depend on the 
combinations used, since the mode of action is new and different from other immunosuppressive 
treatments. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal phase III study, a total of 1779 TEAEs were reported by 164 subjects (98.8%) in the 
avacopan group while a total of 2139 TEAEs were reported by 161 subjects (98.2%) in the comparator 
group. There were in total 166 SAEs in the Comparator group reported in 74 subjects (45.1%) and 116 
SAES in the avacopan group reported in 70 subjects (42.2%) in the phase III study. 
In phase III, six subjects died during the study, comprising 2 subjects (1.2%) in the avacopan group 
and 4 subjects (2.4%) in the comparator group; one additional death occurred during the screening 
period. In the avacopan group, the causes of death in the phase III study were GPA for 1 subject and 
pneumonia for the other; these subjects were not receiving avacopan at the time of death. No deaths 
occurred in Phase I or Phase II studies. 
Assessment report  
Page 101/109 
 
 
 
 
Both in phase II and phase III, the SOCs with the highest subject incidence in the avacopan treated 
subjects were infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorder. Headache, nausea and vomiting 
were reported more often in the avacopan group vs the comparator group in the phase III study. The 
incidence of infections in the phase III study was 75.6% in the comparator group vs 68.1% in the 
avacopan group. For serious infections the incidences in the phase III study were 15.2% in the 
comparator group vs 13.3% in the avacopan group. Eleven subjects (6.7%) had serious opportunistic 
infections in the comparator group compared with 6 subjects (3.6%) in the avacopan group. PTs of 
opportunistic infections in the avacopan arm included pneumonia (n=3) infective exacerbation of 
chronic obstructive airways disease, Campylobacter gastroenteritis and hepatitis B. No Neisseria 
meningitidis infections were reported. 
In the Phase III study, the incidence of TEAEs considered possibly related to glucocorticoid use was 
80.5% in the comparator group compared with 66.3% in the avacopan group. A higher subject 
incidence in the comparator group compared with the avacopan group was observed for AEs of weight 
increased, insomnia, hyperlipidaemia, adrenal insufficiency, increased blood glucose, and irritability.  
Both AEs of hepatic function test and SAEs of hepatic function test were more frequent in the avacopan 
group vs the steroid group in the pooled phase II/phase III data and in the phase III data.  
In the phase III study, there were 22/166 subjects in the avacopan group (13.3%, n=16 for SOC 
Investigations and n=6 for SOC Hepatobiliary disorders) compared to 19/164 subjects in the 
comparator group (11.6%, n=18 for SOC Investigations and n=1 for SOC Hepatobiliary disorders) with 
Any liver function test AE in the pivotal phase III study.  The AEs resolved in all cases; the event was 
“ongoing” in 1 subject (who subsequently died due to worsening of GPA).  
In the CYC/AZA stratum, a total of 6 (10.5%) subjects in the comparator group and 12 (20.3%) 
subjects in the avacopan group experienced a hepatic event. In the prednisone/RTX-stratum, 13 
(12.1%) had such an event and in the avacopan/RTX stratum, 10 (9.3%) subjects had such event. 
Liver function test increased occurred with an SAE incidence of 6 of 164 subjects (3.7%) in the 
comparator group and 9 of 166 subjects (5.4%) in the avacopan group in Phase III study. Study 
medication was interrupted or discontinued in 3 of 6 cases of hepatic function test SAEs in the 
comparator group and 6 of 9 cases in the avacopan group in the phase III study. All events resolved. 
According to the CSR, no liver enzyme elevations in the avacopan group met Hy’s law criteria. 
However, in both treatment groups, several of the subjects with SAEs of hepatic function tests had a 
documented increased bilirubin around the time of the event. In the prednisolone group 2/6 subjects 
belonged to the cyclophosphamide stratum while 4/6 belonged to the rituximab stratum. In the 
avacopan group, 6/9 belonged to the cyclophosphamide stratum while 3/9 belonged to the rituximab 
stratum.  
It is also reported that, in the phase III study, the incidence of hepatobiliary disorders leading to study 
medication discontinuation was 5 of 166 subjects (i.e. 3.0%) in the avacopan group compared with 
none (0.0%) in the comparator group. Study medication was, according to the CSR, paused or 
discontinued permanently due to hepatic enzyme abnormalities in 5 subjects (3.0%) in the comparator 
group and 9 subjects (5.4%) in the avacopan group in the phase III study. 
Two events of angioedema occurred in the phase III study in the avacopan group (2/166=1.2%) vs 
none in the comparator group (0/164=0.0%). In the first case, study medication was discontinued, 
anti-allergic treatment was given, and the event resolved without sequelae. In the second case, study 
medication was interrupted, and the event resolved, study medication was then re-started on Day 83 
and the angioedema did not recur.  
Creatine phosphokinase increases occurred more often among avacopan treated subjects than among 
subjects in the steroid control group both in phase II and phase III. The incidence in the phase III 
Assessment report  
Page 102/109 
 
 
 
 
study was 1 of 164 subjects i.e. 0.6% in the comparator group and 6 of 166 subjects i.e. 3.6% in the 
avacopan group. Associated milder symptoms from muscles or joints/back were reported in many of 
the cases but no serious events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported and treatment could often be 
continued. The majority of the events resolved.   
In the phase III study, there were 4 subjects in the avacopan group and no subjects in the comparator 
group in the phase III study with cardiac failure. The applicant states that the 4 subjects all had a 
medical history of cardiovascular disease and the incidence of serious major cardiovascular events was 
higher in the comparator group. Two SAEs each of angina pectoris and cardiac failure were observed in 
the avacopan group, with none in the comparator group. For 3 of the 4 events it was reported that 
study medication was interrupted but restarted and the subject completed the study, for 1 subject it 
was reported that the study medication was discontinued, and the event resolved. 
Events related to the SOC cardiac disorders was overall somewhat more frequent in the avacopan 
group vs the comparator group across the phase II and phase III studies. 
The incidences of low white blood cell count were generally not higher than in the comparator group 
i.e. the steroid group. In the phase III study, 39 subjects (23.8%) in the comparator group and 31 
subjects (18.7%) in the avacopan group had TEAEs associated with low WBC count.  A total of 8 
subjects (4.9%) in the comparator group had serious TEAEs of neutropenia or lymphopenia compared 
with 4 subjects (2.4%) in the avacopan group; in of all these cases the event resolved, in 3 of the 
cases (2 comparator group and 1 in the avacopan group) treatment was interrupted or discontinued. 
In the phase I study CL001_168, a slight decrease in mean WBC and neutrophil count was, according 
to the CSR, observed more frequently in the healthy subjects receiving CCX168 compared to those 
receiving placebo. 
With regards to background immunosuppressive therapy, in the phase III study, the TEAE incidence 
across many SOCs were higher in the cyclophosphamide compared with the rituximab stratum for both 
treatment groups including infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic 
system disorders. SOCs that had a ≥5% difference in subject TEAE incidence between the two strata in 
the avacopan group, but did not show the same trend in the comparator group included cardiac 
disorders, and hepatobiliary disorders. Also, in the phase II study studies, the TEAE incidence for many 
SOCs was higher in the cyclophosphamide compared with the rituximab stratum in both treatment 
groups. 
Further, the applicant provided analyses, comparing those occurring in the whole study and those 
during the first 20 weeks of the pivotal study (the period during which prednisone was administered to 
the prednisone control group); and similarly comparing those occurring in the whole study to those 
occurring in the time period from Week 21 to the end of the study. The safety results of the entire 
pivotal study, as a whole, and safety results of the ‘on-treatment’ period of the study, showed 
comparable results. Also, when analyses were conducted according to different descriptive comparative 
subgroup analyses, including analyses of safety data (TEAE by SOC, PT, and SAEs) in time periods 
before the cut off time points 26- and 15-weeks, analyses in all subjects, by treatment group and by 
treatment groups strata (RTX and CYC strata), no new significant safety issues that could be 
interpreted as distinct safety signals, in any of the comparisons performed were revealed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
In the non-clinical data, no dose-limiting effects or target organ of toxicity were noted in the 
chronic studies and therefore, the toxicology of avacopan is not considered fully explored; 
Assessment report  
Page 103/109 
 
 
 
 
however, the repeat-dose toxicity profile is considered to have been explored to the extent 
feasible and completes the non-clinical profile of avacopan. 
•  With the data provided it is difficult to assess if the risks associated with avacopan are 
generally dose dependent. Just one of the clinical studies investigated multiple doses and this 
study investigated only two doses. The conclusions that can be drawn is hampered by the low 
number of subjects in the study. The fact that this cannot be fully assessed influences the 
assessments of some of the risks associated with avacopan such as hepatotoxicity. Appropriate 
measures have been reflected in the product information and the RMP. 
•  Considering the heavy background treatment given in both the avacopan groups and the 
comparator groups in the clinical studies, the attribution of avacopan itself to the observed 
unfavourable effects are not always possible to delineate. The safety profile of avacopan as 
monotherapy is somewhat uncertain, but the regular PSUR reports in the post-authorisation 
phase will be monitored by the PRAC. 
• 
• 
Patients with very severe disease (manifested as alveolar haemorrhage requiring invasive 
pulmonary ventilation support and patients with GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or requirement 
for dialysis or plasma exchange) were largely excluded from the clinical trials as well as 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, as reflected in the PI. 
Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies. However, the 
clinical studies conducted to date are far too limited with regards to follow-up time and total 
exposure to provide any substantial reassurance with regards to this risk. Currently, long-term 
safety data up to 52 weeks derives only from the single pivotal study and data beyond this 
time point is so far missing. There is a post-authorisation safety study planned and agreed.  
•  The significance of the observed imbalance in the events related to cardiac disorders in the 
avacopan group vs the comparator group across the phase II and phase III studies is still not 
fully known. The applicant agreed to conduct a post-authorisation PASS.  
• 
There are several limitations of the data that precludes a definitive evaluation of the 
assessment of the risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. These include an overall limited 
clinical safety data base, very limited data from any other dose than 30 mg (which precludes 
an evaluation of dose-dependence), numerous potentially confounding factors and the 
uncertainty of the magnitude of risk increase when avacopan is combined with CYC/AZA 
(MMF).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
ANCA-associated vasculitis is a serious and potentially organ- and life-threatening disease. Standard 
remission induction treatment includes cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with high doses 
of steroids, the latter associated with severe side effects of for example infections, osteoporosis, 
hypertension and diabetes. There is a high unmet need for steroid-sparing agents.  
In the pivotal clinical trial CL010_168, avacopan combined with IV rituximab or IV or oral 
cyclophosphamide  followed by azathioprine (or mycophenolate, if azathioprine was not tolerated) was 
compared to standard treatment with a an oral 20-week regimen of prednisone starting from 60 mg 
daily and tapered to zero by Day 141 combined with IV rituximab or IV or oral cyclophosphamide. The 
primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan to induce and sustain remission in subjects 
with active ANCA-associated vasculitis, when used with cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine, or 
with rituximab. The study included the two primary endpoints, disease remission at week 26 and 
sustained remission at week 52. The two primary endpoints were first tested for noninferiority and 
then for superiority according to a prespecified multiplicity procedure. 
Non-inferiority,  but  not  superiority,  compared  to  the  comparator  arm  was  achieved  at  week  26  with 
respect to induction of remission. Superiority was reached at week 52 for sustained remission. Thus, the 
objectives of the studies were met. The non-inferiority margin of 20% may seem large, but it should be 
noted that the lower 95% CI was -6%. Non-inferiority at week 26 was reached despite a lower GC-dose 
in  the  avacopan  arm.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  observation  is  supported  by  the  outcome  of  the 
secondary endpoint “glucocorticoid toxicity scale”.  
The absolute difference between treatment arms for sustained remission was not large (12.5%), but 
was of clear statistical significance. This superiority analysis at week 52 was the third level in a 
hierarchical testing where the first two levels (non-inferiority at week 26 and non-inferiority at week 
52), was met. The definition of the primary endpoints included the requirement “no glucocorticoid use 
during the last 4 weeks”; a criteria of high clinical relevance (supported by previous CHMP SA). 
However, remission irrespective of glucocorticoid use was included as a pre-specified sensitivity 
analysis. In the sensitivity analysis of remission (BVAS=0) irrespective of glucocorticoid use, avacopan 
was non-inferior to high dose prednisone.  In conclusion, this superiority of avacopan vs high dose 
prednisone at week 52 is considered to be statistically robust and to be the most reliable analysis for 
the efficacy assessment.  
Analyses  of  the  primary  endpoints  in  strata  divided  by  background  treatment  (RTX  or  CYC/AZA) 
demonstrated that the results obtained with avacopan on sustained disease remission at Week 52 were 
consistent  with  the  results  in  the  total  study  population  in  the  rituximab  stratum  (which  comprised 
approximately  2/3  of  total  study  population).  In  the  cyclophosphamide/AZA  stratum,  the  efficacy  of 
avacopan added to azathioprine or mycophenolate seemed less pronounced compared to the total study 
population for sustained remission. However, this stratum was small, and the CI was wide. In addition, 
the proportion of patients needing steroids during the maintenance phase of the study was lower in the 
avacopan  arm  compared  to  the  comparator  arm,  indicating  that  also  these  patients  benefitted  from 
continued treatment after w 26. However, this analysis was not included in the type I error control. 
Patients  were  treated  with  avacopan  for  12  months  and  there  are  no  data  available  for  long-term 
treatment.  
Importance of the unfavourable effects 
Assessment report

An important observation is that in the pivotal phase III study, the subject incidence of TEAEs, SAEs 
and TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation was similar in the avacopan group as compared 
to the comparator group i.e. to current standard of care for ANCA-associated vasculitis. The incidence 
of infections was numerically lower in the avacopan group vs the comparator group (68.1% vs 75.6%). 
Also, not unexpected, TEAEs considered possibly related to glucocorticoid use was lower in the 
avacopan group vs the prednisolone group (66.3% vs 80.5%). Given these data, avacopan may 
provide a useful alternative to steroid treatment in the remission induction and maintenance treatment 
of ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, a requirement for this is that the observed and potential risks 
if avacopan are adequately reflected in the product information and followed post-marketing.  
As the safety database is considered reasonable for an initial MA risk assessment in this rare indication 
but still too limited to for a complete characterisation of many important concerns, the post-marketing 
follow-up beyond 52 weeks is important. Further, it should be noted that patients with very severe 
disease (manifested as alveolar haemorrhage requiring invasive pulmonary ventilation support and 
patients with GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or requirement for dialysis or plasma exchange) were 
largely excluded from the clinical trials. This is, however, adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Infection is an important concern. As infections have the potential to be fatal, it is of outmost 
importance that appropriate risk-mitigating recommendations are included in the SmPC. Such wording 
includes a recommendation for pneumocystis prophylaxis and also address the risk for reactivation of 
hepatitis. In addition, the risks of TB, HIV and the risks associated with having received a recent live 
vaccination has been reflected. Further, recommendations for monitoring of WBC has been included. In 
addition, based on the mechanism of action, the potentially increased risk of infections with Neisseria 
meningitidis was also addressed in the product information. 
Cardiac safety and hepatotoxicity are also important concerns, they are appropriately reflected in the 
SmPC.  
In addition, to further characterise the safety profile of avacopan a  PASS “Avacopan Real World 
Evidence in ANCA Associated Vasculitis” will be conducted, The PASS is included as a Category 3 study 
within the risk management plan together with agreed  milestones, including protocol submission 3 
months post European Commission Decision. In addition, as a first step of planned PASS based on 
existing disease registries, the MAA should conduct a complete feasibility assessment (to be submitted 
post EC decision), including an assessment of the potential data sources from national vasculitis 
registries to ensure feasibility of the requested analyses. 
With regards to background immunosuppressive therapy, in the phase III study, the TEAE incidence 
across many SOCs were higher in the cyclophosphamide/AZA (MMF) stratum compared with the 
rituximab stratum for both treatment groups including infections and infestations, gastrointestinal 
disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders. Adequate information and precautions have been 
included in the SmPC. 
For the theoretical risk for malignancies, the studies conducted to date have a too short follow-up time 
and limited total exposure to provide any substantial reassurance. This concern is thus included in the 
RMP for post-marketing follow-up and is also addressed in the SmPC.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The pivotal phase III study met its primary objective. Avacopan+background therapy was non-inferior 
to prednisone+background therapy at week 26 (despite a lower dose of glucocorticoids in the avacopan 
arm) with respect to induction of remission and reached superiority at week 52 for sustained remission. 
The  absolute  difference  at  week  52  is  modest,  but  statistically  robust  and  of  clinical  relevance. 
Assessment report  
Page 107/109 
 
 
 
 
Hepatoxicity  is  an  identified  risk,  in  particular  in  combination  with  CYC/AZA  (MMF).  Precautions  are 
included in the product information and a PASS will be performed to further characterise avacopan safety 
profile. The B/R of avacopan for the claimed indication is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tavneos is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tavneos is favourable in the following indication: 
Tavneos, in combination with a rituximab or cyclophosphamide regimen, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (see section 4.2). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Assessment report

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avacopan is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan PIP P/0103/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Tavneos as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:

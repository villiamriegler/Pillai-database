2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The virus first emerged as a 
human pathogen in Wuhan province in China and has spread world-wide causing a pandemic. The WHO 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and causes a 
broad spectrum of respiratory infection from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS). 
BNT162b2 is intended for active immunisation against SARS CoV-2, thereby preventing Covid-19. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
The COVID-19 pandemic puts virtually the entire global population at risk of infection as there is no pre-
existing immunity to the SARS-CoV2 virus. Following infection some but not all individuals develop protective 
immunity in terms of neutralising antibody responses and cell mediated immunity. However, it is currently 
unknown to what extent and how long this protection lasts. 
According to the WHO 80% of infected individuals recover without need for hospital care, while 15% develop 
more severe disease and 5% need intensive care.  
Increasing age and underlying medical conditions are considered risk factors for developing severe disease. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The SARS-CoV2 virus has been circulating globally since 2020. It first emerged as a human pathogen in 
Wuhan, China. Like other coronaviruses it is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the 
Spike protein is a surface protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host 
cells. Therefore, the Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been 
shown that antibodies to the Spike protein neutralises the virus and prevents infection. 
2.2.  About the product 
This line extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044/G) concerns the addition of a new strength and 
pharmaceutical form of Comirnaty (referred to as the ‘Ready-To-Use’ or ‘Tris-Sucrose’ formulation) grouped 
with a number of minor variations to update the product information of the currently authorised Comirnaty 
concentrate for dispersion for injection (referred to as ‘PBS-Sucrose’ formulation) and to introduce the INN 
‘Tozinameran’ to the product information of Comirnaty.  
The precise scope of this application is as follows: 
• 
Extension application to add a new pharmaceutical form (dispersion for injection) with a new strength 
(0.1 mg/ml). 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021

• 
• 
• 
• 
To update sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC, section 5, 6 and information for healthcare 
professionals of the PL, section 1 of the Carton Box Label as well as section 1 and 5 of the Vial Label 
to ensure the correct handling by providing dose verification information about strength, age range, 
colour information of the flip-off plastic cap and greyscale images.  
To update sections 4.2 of the SmPC ensure the correct handling in accordance to interchangeability of 
the medicinal product.  
To update section 8 of Carton Box Label to clarify expiry date “EXP” by adding storage temperature 
“(at -90°C to -60°C)” to ensure the correct handling of the medicinal product. 
To change the name of the active substance from COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) to 
Tozinameran. 
The marketing authorisation holder has taken the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes. 
The new Ready-to-Use (RTU) formulation is based on the current approved vaccine except that: 
- 
- 
- 
The formulation buffer has been changed from phosphate buffered saline to Tris buffer without 
sodium chloride and potassium chloride while maintaining the same target pH. 
The RNA concentration is lower. 
The finished product does not require dilution for administration. 
There are no changes to the active substance, or the lipids used to produce the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in 
the bulk finished product. 
Both the applied RTU formulation (Tris/Sucrose finished product) and the approved concentrate (PBS/Sucrose 
finished product) are administered intramuscularly (IM), 30 µg doses (0.3 mL). 
The application strategy is summarised in Table 1 below. The Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) 
strategy has changed from the strategy initially proposed. A network PPQ strategy with PPQ lots from both 
Puurs and Kalamazoo was initially proposed, however this strategy was revised to separate Puurs and 
Kalamazoo in two phases. The initial strategy was to provide data in this Roll 2 from 2 PPQ runs at Puurs with 
2.25 mL vial filling (30 μg doses) and 1 PPQ run at Puurs filled at 1.3 mL and 0.4 mL (10 and 3 μg doses, 
respectively for future paediatric use). However, a revised strategy was executed providing 3 PPQ runs with 
2.25 mL vial filling. 
The current strategy, completed with this Roll 2 submission, is to provide the data from 3 PPQ lots from 
Puurs filled at 2.25 mL per vial. A separate variation will subsequently provide the data from 3 PPQ lots from 
Kalamazoo also filled at 2.25 mL per vial, to support registration of Kalamazoo as an additional site of 
manufacture of the finished product.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 - 
Extensions of marketing authorisations. 
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations. 
Accelerated assessment 
The submission of the application is foreseen for accelerated assessment and is submitted as a so-called 
“rolling submission”, see Table 1 above. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Comirnaty received a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14(7) of the above 
mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria:  
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. In the final efficacy analysis of Phase 2/3 data, among 
participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, 
vaccine efficacy (VE) against confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 95.0%. 
Overall, based on Phase 3 data from approximately 38,000 participants with a median of 2 months of 
follow-up after Dose2 in Study C4591001, BNT162b2 at 30 µg was safe and well-tolerated in 
participants ≥16 years of age. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. COMIRNATY has shown 
efficacy in the pivotal clinical study. Collecting and understanding vaccine effectiveness once it is 
available for use in a broader population in the real-world will, in conjunction with long-term real-
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 12/28 
 
 
 
world safety surveillance of vaccinees, provide information that can be used to conduct a more 
informed determination of risk-benefit for vaccination in various sub-populations. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as there have been, over 66 million cases and >1,524,000 
deaths worldwide as of 5 December 2020. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral drugs approved 
in EU Member States (except UK) to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infections or its associated disease 
COVID-19 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. COVID-19 is a serious and potentially fatal or life-threatening 
human infection. Efficacy of COMIRNATY to prevent COVID- 19 was overwhelmingly demonstrated at 
the final analysis of 170 cases, with a VE of 95%. Potential risks include mostly mild reactogenicity, 
low incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safety observations or safety 
concerns. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The vaccine contains the SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid 
nanoparticles (LNPs). The INN of the active substance is tozinameran, and the common name is COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified). It is also referred to throughout the application as COVID-19 Vaccine 
(BNT162b2). 
The Tris/Sucrose finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of LNPs in an aqueous 
cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular administration. It is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA and administered 
without dilution. One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of tozinameran.  This Line Extension submission 
is for a (6-dose) multi-dose vial only.* 
Other ingredients are: ALC-0315((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), ALC-
0159 2-[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide), DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine), cholesterol, sucrose, trometamol (Tris), trometamol hydrochloride and water. 
The product is available in glass vial (Type 1 borosilicate glass or aluminosilicate glass) sealed with a 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with flip-off plastic cap, in pack sizes of 195 vials or 10 
vials. 
*a single dose vial is planned in future but not included in this current submission.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished product is identical to that used for the 
currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. The same active substance manufacturing sites are used 
for both products. Consequently, there are no changes to the active substance sections and full reference is 
made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection, 
(EMEA/H/C/005735). 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 13/28 
 
 
A Type IA variation is submitted to change the name of the active substance from ‘COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine 
(nucleoside modified)’ to the approved INN ‘Tozinameran’. The variation is considered approvable for the 
currently authorised product. This line extension and future extension / variation applications will use the 
approved INN when referring to the active substance. The product information has been updated accordingly. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product – (0.1 mg/ml) dispersion for injection 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles in an 
aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular injection. The finished product is a multidose vial 
presentation, containing 2.25 mL, intended for 6 doses. No overages are applied to the formulation of the 
finished product. 
The composition of the finished product, including quality standard, function, concentration and amount per 
dose are given in Table 2. 
Table 2 Composition of BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose Finished Product, Multi-dose Vial (225 μg/vial) 
All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, the structural lipid DSPC and the buffer 
component TRIS HCl comply to Ph. Eur. grade. The functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 and the 
structural lipids DSPC and cholesterol are all used in the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product 
Comirnaty. The buffer components Tris base and Tris HCl are commonly used excipients in several already 
approved parenteral medicinal products. 
ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 are novel excipients. In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure 
comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished 
product, additional information was requested as specific obligations (SO) for the PBS/Sucrose finished 
product. These SOs are included in the ongoing variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G. It is confirmed that 
changes to the lipids also will be implemented for the Tris/Sucrose formulation. 
The container closure system for the commercial BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I 
borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm bromobutyl stopper. 
The processing aids used in the manufacture have been specified in the composition together with a foot note 
that they are essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as ingredients 
(excipients).

Pharmaceutical development 
The currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product Comirnaty, is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile, 
multidose concentrate of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles formulated in phosphate buffered saline and 
sucrose, to be diluted for intramuscular administration. The finished product is diluted with 1.8 mL sterile 
0.9% sodium chloride solution to provide 6 doses, each containing a 30 μg active dose in a 0.3 mL dose 
volume. 
The formed RNA-containing LNPs are solid particles relatively homogeneous in size, largely spherical in shape 
and having a nearly neutral surface. Furthermore, the accumulated batch-data to date of the currently 
approved PBS/Sucrose finished product show consistent manufacturing of lipid nanoparticles both with 
respect to size and polydispersity. 
schematic illustration of an exemplary LNP nanoparticle: 
This line extension introduces a Ready To Use (RTU) formulation, referred to as the Tris/Sucrose finished 
product, that is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of LNPs in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for 
intramuscular administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL mRNA in 10 mM 
Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, at a pH of 7.4. Furthermore, the Tris/Sucrose finished product is administered 
without dilution. 
The four lipid excipients, ALC-0315, ALC-0159, DSPC, cholesterol and the sucrose used in the manufacture of 
the Tris/Sucrose finished product are the same as those used for the current PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
Two new excipients, Tris base and Tris HCl, are used in RTU formulation to achieve the desired product pH. 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was developed for the Tris/Sucrose finished product as a basis for 
development based upon the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
Formulation development 
The development of the Tris/Sucrose finished product showed quality attributes highly comparable and also 
within the clinical ranges of the current approved PBS/Sucrose finished product but with an improved stability 
profile in support of increased storage times at -20 °C and 2-8 °C that would simplify transport and 
administration. 
The proposed Tris/Sucrose formulation is equivalent to the current PBS/Sucrose formulation but with the 
following differences: formulation buffer system (Tris vs PBS), mRNA concentration (0.1 mg/mL vs 0.5 
mg/mL) and with an advantage that the proposed Tris/Sucrose finished product does not require dilution 
upon administration. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 15/28 
 
 
 
The section on formulation development describes and justifies the chosen Tris/Sucrose formulation and is 
sufficiently comprehensive. 
Results are provided in the section on formulation development on both 0.5 mL/vial (single-dose vial) and 
2.25 mL/vial (multidose vial) fill volumes. The data provided for a possible future single-dose presentation 
with a fill-volume of 0.5 mL/vial are considered as supportive data only since it should be noted that this line 
extension application only includes the multi-dose presentation and that a future introduction of a single dose 
presentation needs to be applied for via a variation application. 
There are no formula overages in the finished product, only an overfill which has been acceptably justified 
ensuring that six doses can be withdrawn from the multi-dose vial. 
The information given on physicochemical and biological properties is found sufficient. 
Manufacturing process development 
Comparison of manufacturing process design 
The manufacturing process used to produce the Tris/Sucrose finished product includes the same active 
substance and has the same initial steps as for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose formulation, including 
the steps of DS thaw and LNP formation and stabilisation. At the Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) step, Tris 
buffer is introduced instead of PBS buffer, and the concentration adjustment and cryoprotectant addition step 
are modified for the Tris/Sucrose formulation. Subsequent steps of sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
capping/crimping, labelling and freezing for storage are essentially the same between the Tris/Sucrose and 
PBS/Sucrose finished products with minor adjustments to reflect the different filling volume. 
Demonstration of comparability 
A comparability study has been performed for three primary Tris/Sucrose finished product lots for ICH 
stability testing compared to the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. Comparisons used to 
evaluate comparability were made using the finished product specification acceptance criteria, to pre-
determined comparability acceptance criteria from historical release test data for 94 PBS/Sucrose finished 
product lots as well as to extended characterization testing including a well-characterized reference lot 
(EL8983).  
Tris/Sucrose finished product release data and the extended characterization testing results demonstrated 
that the Tris/Sucrose finished product lots are comparable to the registered PBS/Sucrose lots, with only few 
and minor differences noted that are not expected to impact efficacy and safety. All three Tris/Sucrose 
finished products lots for stability testing met all of the release specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished 
product. These three lots also met the established acceptance criteria for the extended characterization 
testing.  
The design of the comparability study utilized for the ICH stability lots has been repeated for three 
commercial scale PPQ lots. The release data and the extended characterization testing results demonstrated 
that the Tris/Sucrose PPQ lots product lots are comparable to the registered PBS/Sucrose lots, with only few 
and minor differences noted that are not expected to impact efficacy and safety. All three Tris/Sucrose PPQ 
lots met all of the release specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished product. These three PPQ lots also met 
the established acceptance criteria for the extended characterization testing. 
It is noted that during the PPQ campaign, one PPQ lot () manufactured with split fill with lower fill volumes, 
had an OOS. This PPQ batch is not included in support of the process validation. Details of the OOS result and 
an investigation report have been provided in section 3.2.P.3.5. The investigation concluded that no specific 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 16/28 
 
 
cause could be attributed to the OOS result and two additional PPQ lots were manufactured to complete the 
validation at 2.25 mL/vial as well as the split fill with lower fill volumes. The conclusions drawn from the 
investigation report and the actions taken to manufacture a fourth and fifth PPQ batch is supported. This is 
found acceptable. 
In conclusion, the analytical comparability assessment performed demonstrated that the Tris/Sucrose 
finished product (manufactured at Pfizer, Puurs as primary finished product lots for ICH stability testing (Roll 
1 submission) and the three commercial scale PPQ lots (Roll 2 submission)) are comparable to the currently 
approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
This is found acceptable. 
Quality attributes 
The quality attributes for the Tris/Sucrose finished product are identical as those for the currently approved 
PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
Process risk assessment strategy 
The process risk assessment strategy for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is a continuation of the strategy 
implemented for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose formulation. 
Process development and characterization 
Process development and characterization studies have been sufficiently performed for the unique steps for 
the Tris/Sucrose formulation. 
Lot genealogy and usage 
Batch data for the three Tris/Sucrose primary stability lots (approximately 7-17% of the planned commercial 
scale) and the three PPQ lots of finished product are found in section 3.2.P.5.4 and all these lots met all of 
the release specifications. The batch data also includes both single-dose (1 lot) and multi-dose presentations 
(2 lots), with the only difference being the fill volume, which is 0.48 mL for single-dose vials and 2.25 mL for 
the 6 dose multi-dose vials. However, it should be noted that this line extension application only includes the 
multi-dose presentation and introduction of a single-dose presentation needs to be performed via a variation 
application. 
Control strategy 
The control strategy for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is based upon and comparable to the control 
strategy of the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. This is found acceptable. 
Analytical method evolution 
The analytical testing strategy for the Tris/Sucrose finished product assessed each analytical procedure to 
determine whether changes were required for testing of the Tris/Sucrose finished product. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the commercial BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I 
borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm bromobutyl stopper. 
Microbiological attributes and compatibility 
Sufficient information is provided on microbiological attributes. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 17/28 
 
 
Results for compatibility support physicochemical stability of the Tris/sucrose finished product in unopened 
thawed vials for up to 24 hours at 30 °C, and in syringes for up to 24 hours at 2-8 °C and 12 hours at 30 °C. 
Furthermore, a microbial in-use hold time study was performed by a challenge test including five compendial 
micro-organisms. No significant growth was observed for any of the microorganisms within 12 hours of 
inoculation of storage at 20-25 °C. 
In conclusion, compatibility of the Tris/sucrose finished product is acceptably demonstrated by the 
compatibility studies provided on physicochemical stability and microbial in-use hold time. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The dossier lists the sites that have responsibilities for the production and testing of Tris/Sucrose finished 
product and their specified functions. All manufacturing sites are already used as manufacturers for the 
currently approved Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection (EMEA/H/C/005735, conditional 
approval 21 Dec 2020). Appropriate proof of GMP compliance of the sites have been provided. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk finished 
product formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. 
The manufacturing process for Tris/Sucrose finished product is identical to that for the PBS/Sucrose 
formulation through LNP formation and stabilization, with subsequent process changes including buffer 
exchange into Tris buffer instead of PBS, concentration adjustment to 0.1 mg/mL RNA instead of 0.5 mg/mL 
and fill volume of 2.25 mL instead of 0.45 mL, allowing for administration without dilution. 
The Tris/Sucrose finished product is manufactured by Pfizer Puurs. Some supportive data are provided from 
the manufacturing site Pfizer Kalamazoo which is planned to become a European supply site at a later time 
point and will by then be submitted as a variation application. 
The commercial batch size is 700 – 1600 L of finished product solution corresponding to approximately 311 
000 – 711 000 vials at 2.25 mL fill volume. 
Sufficient and acceptable in-process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
Process validation has been performed on three Process Performance Qualification batches  at 1600 L batch 
scale and of 2.25 mL fill volume. All data complies with the pre-specified criteria and sufficiently demonstrate 
that the manufacturing process is robust and provide a finished product with adequate quality. The same 
filling lines and similar hold times and filling times are used for Tris/Sucrose finished product as for the 
approved PBS/Sucrose finished product and therefore, no new media fill validation has been performed. The 
applied hold times and the sterilising filters are sufficiently validated. A shipping validation study is performed 
supporting the transport conditions. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specifications at release and shelf life include tests for Appearance (Visual), Appearance 
(Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size 
(Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence 
assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), ALC-0315 content (HPLC-CAD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD), 
DSPC content (HPLC-CAD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-CAD), vial content (volume) (USP), Lipid identities 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 18/28 
 
 
 
(HPLC-CAD), Identity of encoded RNA sequence (RT-PCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow 
cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) 
and Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). For all quality attributes tested on stability except for RNA 
integrity and LNP size, the acceptance criteria for release and stability testing throughout shelf life are the 
same. 
Specification and justification of specifications 
The specifications document for the Tris/Sucrose finished product in section 3.2.P.5.1 includes a 
comprehensive set of relevant tests along with corresponding acceptance criteria. The specifications and 
justification of specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished product are based on the specifications established 
for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. The acceptance criteria that differ between the 
Tris/Sucrose finished product and the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product include osmolality, 
RNA content, lipid content and vial content: 
Osmolality: the osmolality is adjusted to reflect the change in buffer system from PBS- to Tris-buffer. 
RNA content and lipids content: they are adjusted to the 5-fold difference in concentration and consequential 
difference in RNA content and lipids content. 
Vial content: the acceptance criterion is set to ensure that each vial can deliver six doses and it is 
approximately 5-fold higher for the Tris/Sucrose finished product compared to the PBS/Sucrose finished 
product. 
Since the acceptance criteria for the Tris/Sucrose finished product are based on the currently approved 
PBS/Sucrose finished product for the majority of the test attributes, the acceptance criteria for test attributes 
are considered as clinically qualified to ensure quality, efficacy and safety. 
In conclusion, the proposed acceptance criteria in the specifications document in section 3.2.P.5.1 are found 
acceptable and adequately justified for all quality attributes included and no issues are raised. 
Analytical procedures 
Several of the analytical procedures are identical to the corresponding procedures for the already approved 
PBS/Sucrose finished product, while others have been updated for analysis of the Tris/Sucrose presentation. 
Updates include minor modifications in sample preparation and in some cases sample volumes to account for 
the difference in mRNA concentration between the PBS/Sucrose and Tris/Sucrose presentations. The updated 
analytical procedures are deemed validated for testing the Tris/Sucrose finished product. 
Batch analyses 
Batch analysis data have been provided for the three Tris/Sucrose primary finished product lots for ICH 
stability testing as well as for three PPQ batches, all these lots have been manufactured with the commercial 
manufacturing process at the commercial site Pfizer, Puurs. The manufacture of these lots has been detailed 
and their genealogies are provided in Section 3.2.P.2.3. All three Tris/Sucrose finished products lots and all 
three PPQ lots met all of the release specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished product. Furthermore, the 
analytical comparability assessment demonstrated that the Tris/Sucrose finished product lots are comparable 
to the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product with only few and minor differences noted that are 
not expected to impact efficacy and safety. In addition, stability data for the three Tris/Sucrose primary 
finished product lots for ICH stability testing are provided in section 3.2.P.8.  
Characterization of impurities 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 19/28 
 
 
The impurity profile is primarily based on the impurity profile of the materials that are used for the 
manufacturing as well as the lipid impurities. 
The risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamine initially performed for the PBS/Sucrose finished product 
has been updated for the Tris/Sucrose finished product. The conclusion is that there is no risk of the 
Tris/Sucrose vaccine containing nitrosamine impurities of concern. 
A summary of risk assessment on elemental impurities in line with the ICH Q3D, including analytical data, 
has been provided. The conclusion is that there is no risk of the Tris/Sucrose vaccine with respect to 
elemental impurities.  
Reference standard 
The active substance reference material detailed in Section 3.2.S.5.1 Reference Standards or Materials for 
the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product is also used for the Tris/Sucrose finished product for 
release and stability testing with the Fluorescence assay. 
Reference material for the lipids (ALC-0315, ALC-0159, DSPC and cholesterol) is identical to the approved 
PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
The information provided in section P.6 Reference standards or materials is found acceptable. 
Container closure system 
Tris/Sucrose finished product is filled in a Type I borosilicate glass vial or an aluminosilicate glass vial. Both 
these vials are new for use with Tris/Sucrose finished product, but the same stoppers and seals/caps are 
used as for the PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed initial shelf-life for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is 6 months when stored at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -90 to -60 °C. 
The applicant has provided stability results for up to 3 months for three primary stability lots of the 
Tris/Sucrose finished product as well as initial stability results (release) for the three PPQ lots stored at long 
term storage condition at -90 to -60 °C. Furthermore, up to 3 months data are provided for the primary 
stability lots and 1 month data for the PPQ lots at accelerated/additional (-50 ± 5 °C, -20 ± 5 °C, 5 ± 3 °C) 
and stressed storage conditions as well as for temperature cycling and photostability studies.  
The three primary stability lots of the Tris/Sucrose finished product have been manufactured with the 
commercial manufacturing process at the commercial site and with approximately 7-17% of the planned 
commercial scale. It is agreed that these batches can be considered as representative of the proposed 
commercial process for the Tris/Sucrose finished product. 
The stability studies are performed in accordance with ICH Q5C (Quality of biotechnological product: Stability 
testing of biotechnological/biological products) using stability-indicating analytical methods and the same or 
representative container-closure system as will be used for commercial lots are used in these stability 
studies. 
All stability results for the three primary stability lots stored at -90 to -60 °C and at -20 ± 5 °C complies with 
the stability acceptance criteria in the finished product specifications document in section 3.2.P.5.1. Overall, 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 20/28 
 
 
the provided 3 months stability results for the three primary stability lots indicate no signs of degradation, 
significant trends or changes in terms of quality. 
For storage at accelerated/additional storage conditions (-50 ± 5 °C, -20 ± 5 °C, 5 ± 3 °C), the 1 to 3 
months stability data met all acceptance criteria. 
With regards to photostability, based on the stability results, the SmPC section 6.4 reads “Store in the 
original package in order to protect from light. During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.” and section 6.3 states “Thawed vials can be handled in room 
light conditions.” 
For storage at stressed conditions, the 1 month stability data were out of specifications for some quality 
attributes such as in vitro expression and RNA integrity. These data indicate that the Tris/Sucrose finished 
product has limited stability at these temperatures studied. This finding is also seen for the currently 
approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
Section 6.3 in the SmPC states the following: “The vaccine may be received frozen at -90 °C to -60 °C or 
at -25 °C to -15 °C. Frozen vaccine can be stored either at -90 °C to -60 °C or 2 °C to 8 °C upon receipt.” 
This statement is supported by the overall picture of the Tris/Sucrose finished product stability based on the 
provided stability data in section 3.2.P.8 on long-term (at -90 to -60 °C) and additional storage conditions (at 
-20 ± 5 °C and 2 to 8 °C), the temperature cycling studies as well as the transport validation data provided 
in section 3.2.P.3.5. 
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment 
A minimum of one lot of the Tris/Sucrose finished product will be added at long-term storage condition of -90 
to -60 °C to the on-going post-approval stability program annually. The applicant has confirmed that they will 
continue all the ongoing stability studies at long-term conditions until completion. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported. 
Concluding remarks on the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions 
The proposed initial shelf-life for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is 6 months when stored at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -90 to -60 °C.  
The initial shelf life is based primarily on the established stability for the PBS/Sucrose finished product and 3 
months of data for the Tris/Sucrose primary stability finished product lots. Additionally, the stability data 
generated to date on the BNT Tris/Sucrose primary stability lots also support short term storage at 5 ± 3°C 
for up to 3 months (within the 6 month shelf life). As discussed, and concluded in sections 3.2.P.2.3 and 
3.2.P.5.4, it is agreed that the analytical comparability assessment performed has demonstrated that the 
three Tris/Sucrose finished product lots manufactured at Pfizer, Puurs as primary finished product lots for ICH 
stability testing (Roll 1 submission) and the three full commercial scale PPQ lots (Roll 2 submission) are 
comparable to the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
Therefore, it is agreed that the provided results for Tris/Sucrose formulation combined with the prior 
knowledge on stability of the PBS/Sucrose formulation support the proposed 6 months shelf-life at -90 to -60 
°C and 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use within the 6 months shelf-life, as stated and proposed 
in section 6.3 in the SmPC. 
In addition, the following statement in section 6.3 is also supported by the submitted stability data: “The 
vaccine may be received frozen at -90 °C to -60 °C or at -25 °C to -15 °C. Frozen vaccine can be stored 
either at -90 °C to -60 °C or 2 °C to 8 °C upon receipt.”

As discussed above. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished product is identical to that used for the 
currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. Consequently, there are no changes to the active 
substance sections and full reference is made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate for 
dispersion for injection, (EMEA/H/C/005735). Adequate testing for bioburden, endotoxins and sterility are 
also included at appropriate stages of the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
2.4.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.1.  Finished Medicinal Product – (0.5 mg/ml) concentrate for dispersion for

concentrate for dispersion for injection; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Type IB C.I.z - To update sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC, section 5, 6 and information for 
healthcare professionals of the PL, section 1 of the Carton Box Label as well as section 1 and 5 of the 
Vial Label to ensure the correct handling by providing dose verification information about strength, 
age range, colour information of the flip-off plastic cap and greyscale images.  
Type IB C.I.z - To update sections 4.2 of the SmPC ensure the correct handling in accordance to 
interchangeability of the medicinal product.

Type IA A.3 - To change the name of the active substance from COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside 
modified) to Tozinameran. 
The proposed changes to product information (SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet) are found acceptable. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This line extension introduces a Ready To Use (RTU) formulation, referred to as the Tris/Sucrose finished 
product, that is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of LNPs in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for 
intramuscular administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL mRNA in 10 mM 
Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, at a pH of 7.4. Furthermore, the Tris/Sucrose finished product has been 
developed to provide a vaccine with an improved stability profile and greater ease of use at administration 
sites. 
The section on formulation development describes and justifies the chosen Tris/Sucrose formulation and is 
sufficiently comprehensive. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and variations  
EMA/594686/2021 
Page 22/28 
 
 
The analytical comparability assessment performed demonstrated that lots manufactured as primary finished 
product lots for stability testing and the commercial scale PPQ lots of the Tris/Sucrose finished product are 
comparable to the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product.  
The manufacturing process for Tris/Sucrose finished product is identical to that for the PBS/Sucrose 
formulation through LNP formation and stabilization, with subsequent process changes including buffer 
exchange, concentration adjustment, and fill volume. The manufacturing process has been acceptably 
described. 
The specifications document for the Tris/Sucrose finished product includes a comprehensive set of relevant 
tests and the proposed acceptance criteria are found acceptable and adequately justified for all quality 
attributes included and no issues are raised.  
The proposed 6 months shelf-life for the finished product at -90 to -60 °C and 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at 
the point of use within the 6 months shelf-life is agreed. 
The proposed changes to product information (SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet) of the currently 
approved Comirnaty concentrate formulation are found acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided in rolling review 2 (RR2) submission, the 
CHMP considers that this line extension application to register Comirnaty 0.1 mg/ml (30 micrograms/dose) 
dispersion for injection is approvable from the quality point of view. 
Furthermore, the grouped Type IB variations included in the submission to amend the current SmPC, label 
and package leaflet of the approved Comirnaty 0.5 mg/ml (30 micrograms/dose) concentrate formulation and 
the Type IA variation to change the active substance name from ‘COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside 
modified)’ to the INN ‘Tozinameran’ are approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.4.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable, reference is made to the data of Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection,

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in 
the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, causing WHO to

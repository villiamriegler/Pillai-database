2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Pemetrexed Sandoz 100 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion has the 
same active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts the centrally approved reference 
medicinal product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002). 
The claimed indications for this generic application are: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma:  
• Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naive patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.  
Non-small cell lung cancer:  
• Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology.  
• Pemetrexed is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has 
not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy.  
• Pemetrexed is indicated as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
As monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin the recommended dose of Pemetrexed Lilly is 500 mg/m2 of 
body surface area (BSA) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-
day cycle. 
Both Pemetrexed Sandoz and the originator product Alimta must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to 
use. After reconstitution, each strength of the proposed product contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed.

About the product 
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial folate-
dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
Mode of action 
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate 
synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), 
which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. 
Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein 
transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms 
by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.  
The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 
Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser 
extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in 
prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg/vial, 
500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial of pemetrexed (as disodium salt hemipentahydrate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are mannitol, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in clear, colourless, type I glass vials with chlorobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium 
crimp caps with flip-off caps as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. Two ASMFs support the application for Pemetrexed Sandoz. 
The chemical name of pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-
pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid disodium salt hemipentahydrate  and has the 
following structure and properties: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 7/20 
 
  
  
Molecular formula: C19H21N5Na2O6.[H2O]2.5   -   Relative molecular mass: 516.4 gmol-1 
The active substance is a white to off-white hygroscopic crystalline solid, freely soluble in water but 
practically insoluble in organic solvents. It has one chiral centre which originates in one of the starting 
materials and which is tested in the active substance by specific optical rotation and chiral HPLC. 
Two polymorphs of pemetrexed disodium are known. The heptahydrate has a Ph. Eur. monograph whilst the 
hemipentahydrate used in this product is routinely produced by the given manufacturing processes. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis of pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is documented in two ASMFs supporting this 
procedure. Each uses a different manufacturing route. One employs one manufacturer to make an 
intermediate and another to convert this to the active substance. The second has two manufacturers 
employing different routes to make an intermediate and a third which converts it to the active substance. All 
manufacturing routes start from well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Starting materials in both ASMFs were re-defined during the procedure as a result of major objections, thus 
ensuring that steps critical to the quality of the active substance are described in the dossier. Active 
substance from both sources is released against the same set of specifications. Batch data indicates that 
active substance from both sources performs equivalently in secondary manufacture and produces finished 
product of equivalent quality. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. Potentially genotoxic impurities were demonstrated not to be detected in the active 
substance and are thus not routinely tested for. 
The active substance is packaged in either double heat-sealed polyethylene bags sealed inside a heat-sealed 
aluminium bag or doubly heat-sealed LDPE bags with an intermediate silica gel pouch, packed inside a triple 
laminated  sunlight  barrier  bag  and  stored  inside  an  HDPE  drum,  depending  on  the  source.  All  materials 
comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 8/20 
 
 
  
  
Specification 
A unified specification is provided for active substance from both sources by the finished product 
manufacturer, and is based on the Ph. Eur. monograph for the heptahydrate salt. The active substance 
specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC, sodium test (Ph. Eur.), colour, clarity and pH 
of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), optical isomer content (chiral HPLC), chloride (Ph. 
Eur.), sulfate (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the reference standards has 
been provided in both ASMFs. 
Batch analysis data on six production scale batches of active substance from one manufacturer and three 
from the other substance were provided. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from one ASMF holder stored in 
packaging simulating the proposed commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5±3 
ºC), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (15 ºC / 60% RH), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. Out of specification results were 
observed for impurities under accelerated conditions, but no significant trends were observed under 
intermediate or long term conditions. Forced degradation studies including photostability studies following the 
ICH guideline Q1B were performed showing the active substance is sensitive to acid, base, light and oxidation 
but stable to thermal degradation. No racemisation occurred under any condition. The active substance from 
this source has a re-test period of 36 months when stored at 5±3 ºC in the original packaging. 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the other ASMF holder stored in 
packaging simulating the proposed commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5±3 
ºC) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Samples were tested for appearance, identity, clarity and colour of solution, specific optical rotation 
and optical isomer, impurities, water content, bacterial endotoxins and microbial limits. In addition, 
supportive stability data was provided on an additional seven batches of active substance for up to 24 
months under long term conditions and for four of these, for up to 36 months at -20 ºC (a further long term 
condition).  An out of specification result was observed for one impurity at 5±3 ºC and for several impurities 
under accelerated conditions. Forced degradation studies show the active substance is sensitive to oxidation. 
Active substance from this source has a re-test period of 24 months when stored at -20 ºC and 12 months 
when stored at 5±3 ºC in the original packaging. 
Although the amount of stability data generated is different for each supplier, the trends are aligned. Stability 
commitments have been provided by each ASMF holder in order to generate additional data from one batch 
per year according to GMP and to continue the on-going studies until their planned conclusion. The finished 
product manufacturer stores the active substance in the original packaging at 5±3 ºC for up to the prescribed 
time from each supplier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 9/20 
 
  
  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest periods at 5±3 ºC in the proposed containers. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to produce a finished product equivalent to Alimta which is a lyophilised powder 
containing only the active substance, mannitol, and the pH adjusting agents HCl or NaOH. Pemetrexed 
Sandoz uses a different hydrate form to the reference medicinal product, but since it is fully solubilised during 
formulation, this has no impact. It is however more unstable and thus needs to be stored under controlled 
conditions. The excipients used are the same as for the reference medicinal product and are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients whose quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. An 
over-fill of vials is used in order to ensure the claimed amount can be withdrawn from vials following 
reconstitution. The reconstitution method is adequately described in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
Since the finished product is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution in the same concentration as 
Alimta, the excipients are qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent, and the active substance is freely 
soluble in aqueous media, no bioequivalence study was required. 
The active substance is unstable to oxygen and heat once in solution. Thus, all manufacture is carried out 
under a nitrogen atmosphere and temperature is limited to 2-8 ºC for processing times beyond four hours at 
25 ºC. Terminal sterilisation by heat or radiation was demonstrated to be unsuitable due to instability of the 
finished product. Thus, the finished product is manufactured sterile filtration followed by aseptic processing. 
The lyophilisation was optimised during development to afford a stable and elegant cake. This had to be re-
optimised following scale-up in commercial equipment and the manufacturing process subsequently 
underwent further refinement to ensure proper control of headspace oxygen content. 
The primary packaging is clear, colourless type I glass vials with chlorobutyl rubber stoppers. The vials are 
sealed with aluminium crimp caps with a flip-off caps. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: compounding and pre-filtration; sterile filtration and 
filling; lyophilisation; stoppering and further packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. Of note, 
the pH, clarity, bioburden and oxygen content of solutions are checked during compounding, filters are 
checked for integrity before and after use, and the headspace of the sealed vials is checked by NIR for 
oxygen content. 
Process validation was carried out on four batches of the 100 mg/ml strength, seven batches of the 500 
mg/ml strength, and three batches of the 1000 mg/ml strength. The process was subsequently re-validated 
on two batches of each strength due to changes implemented late in development. The combination of data 
provided demonstrates that the major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated. It has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 10/20 
 
  
  
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of the intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
description of cake, reconstitution time, description of solution, clarity, colour and pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), 
visible and sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), identification (UV, HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
water content (KF), optical isomer content (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and headspace oxygen (NIR). Limits are set in line with the relevant 
ICH guidelines and batch data. Tests are designed to ensure the product is equivalent to the innovator 
product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards of the active substance and 
impurities has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four production scale batches of 100 mg/vial presentation, seven 
production scale batches of the 500 mg/vial strength, and three production scale batches of the 1000 mg/vial 
presentation confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. These batches were manufactured before the introduction of the revised vial 
closure process. Batch analysis data on an additional two production scale batches of each strength were 
provided, meeting all specifications including the newly added test for headspace oxygen. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on four production scale batches of the 100 mg/vial strength, seven batches of the 500 mg/vial 
strength and three batches of the 1000 mg/vial strength, all manufactured at production scale stored for up 
to 36 months under refrigerated conditions (5±3 ºC), for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC 
/ 60% RH), for up to 36 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Other than 
the subsequent change in vial stoppering process, the batches of Pemetrexed Sandoz were identical and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Vials were stored in both upright and inverted 
positions. Batches of each strength were manufactured using active substance from both suppliers. Samples 
were tested according to the release specifications with the omission of the test for headspace oxygen. No 
significant changes were observed to any of the measured parameters other than an increase in impurities 
under intermediate and accelerated conditions in some samples. These studies were instigated before the 
revision of the vial stoppering process and a correlation between oxygen ingress and an increase in impurities 
has been demonstrated. New stability studies on two batches of each strength manufactured using the new 
process are underway under all conditions. After six months, all measured parameters remained well within 
their specifications and no trends were observed. 
In addition, the finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were observed to appearance of the 
solid or solutions thereof, nor to assay and impurity levels. It can be concluded that the finished product is 
not photosensitive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 11/20 
 
  
  
Forced degradation studies were carried out with reconstituted samples treated with heat, acid, base, light 
and or an oxidant. The product is unstable under each condition. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. 
Thermal cycling studies were also carried out in order to assess the impact of brief temperature excursions. 
Samples were stored at -20 ºC and 40 ºC for 3 x 48 hours at each extreme, then stored under long term 
conditions for up to 6 months. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed, 
indicating the low impact of brief temperature excursions. 
Finally, in use stability studies were carried out as reconstituted and in infusion solutions in either 5% glucose 
or 0.9% sodium chloride at concentrations of 4 and 10 mg/ml. Samples were stable for up to 4 days at 5±3 
ºC without light protection. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions and as stated 
in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 12/20 
 
  
  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Pemetrexed Sandoz manufactured by Sandoz is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all pemetrexed containing products and the exposure of the environment to the 
active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.  
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of pemetrexed are well known. No non-
clinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is considered of 
suitable quality.  
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing pemetrexed.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of pemetrexed based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Exemption  
Pemetrexed Sandoz has the same active substance,excipients, indications, route of administration, dosage 
form and posology as Alimta.  
Alimta is available in two presentations in the European market: 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial of pemetrexed 
(as pemetrexed disodium). 
The proposed presentations of Pemetrexed Sandoz are: 100 mg/vial, 500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial. 
The composition of Pemetrexed Sandoz 100 mg and 500 mg vial and Alimta 100 mg and 500 mg vial is 
qualitatively identical, with small quantitative differences only. A quantitative composition comparison of the 
applied and the reference product is provided below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 13/20 
 
  
  
The qualitative composition of the new presentation, 1000 mg/vial, is comparable to the composition of the 
100 mg and 500 mg vials. 
Both products are intended for intravenous use and must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to use. 
After reconstitution each presentation of both the proposed product and the originator product contains 
25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
Biowaiver 
No bioequivalence studies have been submitted. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), bioequivalence 
studies are generally not required if the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution 
containing the same active drug substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product. 
Pemetrexed Sandoz is to be administered as an intravenous aqueous solution and contains the same active 
drug substance at the same concentration as the reference product (25 mg/mL) therefore, no bioequivalence 
studies are required. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
The two lowest strengths (100 mg and 500 mg) of the medicinal product have been authorised in Chile since 
June 2014. No post-marketing data were submitted for this application, and the applicant has confirmed that 
no such data are available.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pemetrexed Sandoz, 100 mg and 500 mg, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, has the same 
active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts as the reference medicinal product, Alimta. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 14/20 
 
 
  
  
Furthermore, Pemetrexed Sandoz has the same indications, posology, pharmaceutical form, route of 
administration and strength after reconstitution as Alimta. 
Although a new presentation of 1000 mg is introduced by the Applicant compared to the reference product, 
the application is still considered to be a generic application as the reconstituted product has the same 
concentration as the reference product regardless of the presentation. Therefore, the introduction of the 
1000 mg presentation is considered acceptable. 
There are no concerns with Pemetrexed Sandoz from a clinical efficacy point of view. 
No new studies have been conducted and none are required under the provisions of the Note for Guidance on 
the investigation of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev. 1): “Bioequivalence 
studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous 
solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product”. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that there are no objections to approval of Pemetrexed Sandoz 100 mg, 500 mg and 
1000 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion from a clinical point of view. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The 1000 mg strength does not exist for the reference originator Alimta. Therefore, PRAC and CHMP estimate 
that, even if not listed as a specific risk in the RMP of Pemetrexed Sandoz, the risk of medication error should 
be under specific surveillance by the MAH. Should a significant increase in the frequency of reported 
medication errors be detected, the MAH should report this as a signal. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Pemetrexed Sandoz is a generic product of the centrally approved medicinal product Alimta 
(EU/1/04/290/001-002). 
The proposed product information (PI) for Pemetrexed Sandoz is almost identical to the PI of the reference 
product. There are minor differences due to the adaptation of the PL to the last version of the QRD template. 
However, these changes do not affect the results of the previous readability test, therefore the bridging 
statement to the Alimta PI is considered acceptable 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
The reference product Alimta is indicated for  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has not 
progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. However, the applicant provided a clinical overview 
on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature which was considered sufficient. 
Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the Guideline on the 
investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1) since the product is to be administered as 
an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the 
currently authorised product 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product Alimta can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/467935/2015 
Page 18/20 
 
  
  
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Pemetrexed Sandoz in the following indications: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed Sandoz in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer

Maternal immunisation has proved its benefit in protecting 
relation to the frequency of adverse reactions 
somnolence (from uncommon to very common) and 
fatigue (from very common to uncommon) and to 
update the safety and immunogenicity information in 
infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa during pregnancy; based on data generated 
from DTPA-048 and DTPA-049; these are phase IV, 
open-label, non-randomised, multicentre studies 
aimed to provide immunological responses to 
Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection status for 
diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), HBs antigen, inactivated 
poliovirus (IPV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b 
(Hib) antigens (PRP) and in terms of vaccine or 
booster responses to the pertussis antigens, 1 month 
neonates against (severe) pertussis disease during the first 
months of life. 
Based on data generated from DTPA-048 and DTPA-049, 
post-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological 
data did not show clinically relevant interference of 
maternal vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, acellular 
pertussis (dTpa) on the infant’s and toddler’s responses to 
diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. 
Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens 
post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-booster (PT, 
FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers 
Page 19/93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after the last dose of the primary vaccination or the 
booster dose.  
The MAH took the opportunity to update the 
posology information in the package leaflet to align it 
with the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.1.

B.II.d.2.d - Change in test procedure for the finished 
product - Other changes to a test procedure 
born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy. 
The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations 
from the pre-booster to the 1-month post-booster time 
point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born 
to mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, 
demonstrating effective priming of the immune system. In 
the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the 
clinical relevance of these observations remains to be fully 
understood. However, current epidemiological data on 
pertussis disease following the implementation of dTpa 
maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical 
relevance of this immune interference. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the frequency 
for “Fatigue” (from very common to uncommon) and 
“Somnolence” (from uncommon to very common) as a 
result of the reencoding “Drowsiness” under the MedDRA 
Preferred Term from “Fatigue” to “Somnolence”.

13/01/2020 
SmPC 
Long-term persistence of seroprotective antibody 
information on the persistence of immunity against 
hepatitis B up to 14-15 years of age, based on 
results from study DTPa-HBV-IPV-115. This was a 
phase IV, open-label, multicentre study to assess the 
long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis 
B and the immunogenicity and safety of a challenge 
dose of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B Kinder 
SKF103860) in children aged 14-15 years, previously 
primed and boosted in the first two years of life with 
four doses of GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 
(Infanrix hexa SB217744) vaccine. 
In addition, in line with the SmPC Guideline, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce in section 4.1 of 
the SmPC a statement regarding the use of Infanrix 
hexa in accordance with official recommendations.

concentrations against HBV was observed in approximately 
half of the adolescents aged 14-15 years who received 4 
doses of Infanrix hexa during infancy. Despite half of the 
subjects having antibody levels below the seroprotection 
threshold of ≥10 mIU/ml, an anamnestic response to a 
challenge dose of monovalent HBV vaccine was shown in 
more than 90% of subjects. The results suggested that 
protective immune memory persists in the majority of 
subjects up to 14-15 years of age. In addition, the results 
indicated that the long-term immune response to hepatitis 
B component of the Infanrix hexa vaccine is comparable to 
the immune response to monovalent HBV vaccine.

appetite lost and irritability when Infanrix hexa was co-
administered with MenB vaccine and 7-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, separate vaccinations can 
be considered when possible.

The MAH has also taken the opportunity to make 
some changes in relation to the QRD template, 
formatting changes and typos correction. The details 
of the Czech and Maltese local representatives are 
also revised in the package leaflet. Annex A is also 
revised to provide a more precise value for the 
quantity of tetanus toxoid carrier contained in the 
effectiveness of the Hib component against Hib disease. 
The study covered the years 2001-2007 (seven years of 
surveillance associated to the use of the hexavalent 
vaccines). 
The effectiveness of the Hib component of two hexavalent 
vaccines, of which one was Infanrix hexa, was 89.6% (95% 
CI: 74.4-95.8) for a full primary series and 100% (95% CI:

irrespective of the Hib vaccine used for priming. 
Effectiveness was 78.9% (95% CI: 47.2-91.5) for an 
incomplete primary series, and 100% (95% CI: 99.7-
100.0) for a 2nd year dose without full immunisation. 
Vaccine effectiveness for DTaP-IPV-HB/Hib combination 
vaccines against invasive Hib was 92.8% (95% CI: 82.3-
97.1) for children vaccinated according to their age and to 
the German recommended vaccination schedule. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the

with relevant guidelines. The PL was updated 
accordingly. In addition, the previously agreed class 
wording on apnoea was reflected in the PL as 
requested by the CHMP in July 2008. The MAH also 
took the opportunity to update all annexes (including 
labelling and annex II) in line with the latest version 
of the EMEA/QRD templates and to update the 
contact details of some local representatives in the 
PL (Romania, Slovakia).

Premature infants might be vaccinated. However, a lower 
immune response may be observed. A warning was 
included to remind prescribers that the level of protection 
in these premature infants is currently not known.  
The undesirable effects section was fully reorganised in 
accordance with the frequency and seriousness of the 
events that have been reported. This means that some 
events were moved, reworded or deleted if not applicable. 
The following adverse events were added as reported in the 
post marketing setting: apnoea, in line with the warning 
which had been added following a variation that affected all 
infant vaccines; and injection site vesicles, 
lymphadenopathy and angioedema, as some cases were 
reported for which an alternative cause could not be 
established.  
Wording on persistence of protective antibodies against 
Hepatitis B was included in the product information.  
Further to the SPC update regarding the potential risk of 
apnoea in very premature infants, the PL was updated to 
inform that in babies born very prematurely (at or before 
28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between 
breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. 
All annexes (SPC, annex II, labelling and PL) were updated 
in line with the latest version of the EMEA/QRD templates. 
The contact details for Romania and Slovakia were 
updated.

follow-up (1997-2005) showed that acellular pertussis 
vaccines are effective in infants vaccinated according to the 
3-5-12 month vaccination schedule (i.e. primary 
vaccination at 3 and 5 months, booster dose at 12 
months). However, protection against pertussis may be 
waning at 7-8 years of age with. Therefore, a second 
booster dose of pertussis vaccine may be needed in 
children aged 5-7 years who have previously been 
vaccinated according to this schedule.

and of another hexavalent vaccine was assessed via a 
surveillance study on Haemophilus influenzae disease in 
Germany. Over five years of follow-up (2001-2005), the 
effectiveness of hexavalent vaccines against invasive Hib 
infection was 68.4% for children receiving less than 3 
doses in the first year of life without booster (i.e. 
incomplete primary series) and 90.4% for the full primary 
series. For the second year dose, vaccine effectiveness was 
100.0% (regardless of priming). These results confirmed 
the high effectiveness of hexavalent vaccines against 
invasive Hib disease.

infants after immunisation the CHMP recommended a class 
labelling on apnoea for all vaccines in very premature 
infants.  
The SPC was updated to include information about  the 
potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory 
monitoring for 48-72h, when the primary immunisation 
series is administered to very premature infants (born ? 28 
weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a 
previous history of respiratory immaturity. Nonetheless, 
preterm infants should not be withdrawn from the 
immunisation scheme because the benefit of vaccination 
outweighs the risk of apnoea.

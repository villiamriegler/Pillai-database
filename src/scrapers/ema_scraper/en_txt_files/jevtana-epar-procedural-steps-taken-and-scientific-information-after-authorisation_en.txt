SmPC 
In a non-inferiority, multicenter, multinational,  
order to add information from completed study 
EFC11785 (Randomized, open-label multicenter 
study comparing cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m2 and at 25 
mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with 
prednisone for the treatment of metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen). In 
addition, the MAH is proposing to modify the wording 
in section 4.1 of the indication from “hormone 
refractory” to “castration resistant” prostate cancer 
to reflect current terminology of the disease in the 
clinical practice. The RMP is updated accordingly and 
in accordance with the request from the latest PSUR 
procedure 
(EMEA/C/H/002018/PSUSA/000476/201506) 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
randomized, open label phase III study (EFC11785 study), 
1200 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate 
cancer, previously treated with a docetaxel-containing 
regimen, were randomized to receive either cabazitaxel 25 
mg/m2 (n=602) or 20 mg/m2 (n=598) dose. Overall 
survival (OS) was the primary efficacy end-point. The study 
met its primary objective of demonstrating the non-
inferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 in comparison with 25 
mg/m2 (see table 4). A statistically significantly higher 
percentage (p<0.001) of patients showed a PSA response 
in the 25 mg/m2 group (42.9%) compared to the 20 
mg/m2 group (29.5%). A statistically significantly higher 
risk of PSA progression in patients with the 20 mg/m2 dose 
with respect to the 25 mg/m2 dose was observed (HR 
1.195; 95%CI: 1.025 to 1.393). There was no statistically 
difference with regards to the other secondary endpoints 
(PFS, tumour and pain response, tumour and pain 
progression, and four subcategories of FACT-P). 
The safety profile of cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 observed in 
study EFC11785 was qualitatively and quantitatively similar 
to that observed in the study EFC6193. Study EFC11785 
demonstrated a better safety profile for the cabazitaxel 20 
mg/m2 dose. 
If patients continue to experience any of the reported 
reactions at 20 mg/m2, further dose reduction to 15 
mg/m2 or discontinuation of JEVTANA may be considered. 
Data in patients below the 20 mg/m2 dose are limited.

of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and

benefit/risk profile of Jevtana continues to be favourable. 
The CHMP considers that the safety profile of Jevtana and 
in particular the risk of neutropenia and its complications, 
the risk of bleeding and respiratory disorders, should

continue to be closely monitored. Additional safety data 
have been requested and are being assessed as part of the 
PSURs. In addition, the post-marketing study EFC11785 
comparing cabazitaxel dosage of 20 mg/m² versus 25 
mg/m² in combination with prednisone for the treatment of 
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen is still ongoing 
and the results are expected to yield important new safety 
and efficacy data to optimise cabazitaxel dosage. Based on 
the assessment of the PSURs and the results of study 
EFC11785 the need for additional pharmacovigilance 
activities and/or risk minimisation measures will be 
reviewed. Therefore, considering the overall safety profile 
of Jevtana and the need for further data, an additional 
renewal is recommended.

affect cabazitaxel’s pharmacokinetics in vivo. Therefore, the 
MAH carried out a drug interaction study (TCD10870) to 
include the risk of interaction between cabazitaxel and a 
strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) as well as the 
interaction between cabazitaxel and a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor (ketoconazole) on the pharmacokinetics of 
cabazitaxel in cancer patients. Cabazitaxel AUC increases 
about 25% when administered concomitantly with 
ketoconazole, whereas with rifampicin, it decreases about 
17%.Therefore the concomitant administration of strong 
inhibitors and inducers should be avoided.The safety 
studies showed that the co-administration of a P-gp 
inhibitor with cabazitaxel was not a risk factor for CNS 
toxicity.

a separate cohort (cohort 5) in patients with normal hepatic

combination of a single dose of cabazitaxel with a single 
dose of oral midazolam altered the plasma exposure of

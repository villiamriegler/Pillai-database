Retrospective cohort study - pharmacokinetics and exposure outcome in neonates 
administered lacosamide, report ep0155 
Description 
Methods 
EP0155 was a retrospective cohort study that used electronic healthcare record (EHR) data from the 
Pediatric Network (PEDSnet) data network. The primary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and effectiveness outcomes in neonates exposed to any dose of LCM in clinical practice. The 
secondary objectives were to estimate the incidence of the selected medical events of interest 
(6 system organ classes and 2 Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries). 
EP0155 used EHR data from the PEDSnet multi-institutional database and University of Michigan C.S. 
Mott’s Children’s Hospital. Data from both databases are stored in the Patient-Centered Clinical 
Research Network (PCORnet®) database common data model (Version 5.1), where all elements are in 
a structured format. 
Electronic healthcare record data from 01 Jan 2009 to 29 Feb 2020 were extracted from the PCORnet 
database. Patients were selected for inclusion in EP0155 based on LCM exposure only (ie, they did not 
have to have a diagnosis of epilepsy). Lacosamide could have been used as monotherapy or adjunctive 
to a prior antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy during an intensive care or in-hospital stay. Patients were 
followed for a maximum of 30 days.

Study participants 
Inclusion criteria:  
• Neonates <30 calendar days of age (or gestational age equivalent) on index date  
• At least 35 weeks gestational age   
• Treated with LCM (iv or oral, any dose) on index date  
Exclusion criteria:  
• Patients outside the neonatal age range at index date, as they did not fit the criteria of a neonate at 
treatment onset.   
• Patients born very preterm (<35 weeks) as these babies did not have the same seizure etiology 
which would respond to AED.  
Treatments 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives: 
1. To obtain measurements of pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (plasma concentration) by obtaining 
drug dosing with time stamps and blood tests with time stamps at any time during the first observable 
episode of exposure to lacosamide and thereafter up to 30 days. 
2. To assess effectiveness outcomes in a noncomparative design, evaluating endpoints within 30 days 
of drug start. 
Secondary objectives 
1. To estimate the incidence of the selected medical events for 6 System Organ Classes (SOC) namely: 
i) Cardiac disorders; ii) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; iii) Nervous system disorders; iv) 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders; v) Administration site conditions and injury; vi) Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders. 
2. Plus 2 Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries (SMQs) namely: i) Drug 
rash - reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome; ii) Severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Sample size 
The study analyzed data from a convenience sample of patients from both databases. No formal  
sample size computation was done. A feasibility assessment identified at least 40 patients ever  
exposed to iv LCM who were < 30 days of age. The study selection criteria were not very restrictive, so 
it was assumed that the sample size would not be significantly reduced. This sample size was sufficient 
to evaluate the primary objective of the study which was purely descriptive in nature.

In most cases, electroencephalography (EEG) data were only available for up to 3 days, as this was 
what was deemed clinically necessary for these patients. Therefore, it was considered more 
appropriate to define outcomes as EEG outcomes rather than effectiveness outcomes.

Electroencephalography data were available for 34 patients on Day 1, for 26 patients on Day 2, and for 
21 patients on Day 3, respectively.  
On Day 1, in the 31 patients with electrographic seizures, the effectiveness assessment showed that 
<11 patients  had any improvement, <11 patients  had no change, and 13 patients (42.0%) had 
unknown responses. A total of <11 patients  had an improvement in seizure burden of >50%.  
On Day 2, in the 17 patients with electrographic seizures, <11 patients  showed improvement, <11 
patients  showed no change, and <11 patients  had unknown responses.  
On Day 3, in the 12 patients with electrographic seizures, <11 patients  showed no change in seizure 
burden, and the response was unknown in the remaining <11 patients. 
PK results 
Pharmacokinetic data were not available in patient charts for most patients (ie, only <11 patients had 
any PK data). Given the small number of values, a meaningful analysis of PK data was not possible.

(<11), cerebral ischemia (<11), cerebral ventriculomegaly (<11), thalamic infarction (<11), broken 
skin (<11), candidiasis of skin (<11), cellulitis of upper limb (<11)  
The median duration of follow up for safety evaluations was 12.0 days. During the follow-up period, 
<11 patients  died; none of the deaths were ascribed to LCM in the patients’ charts.  
Among the AESI for LCM, cardiac arrest was observed in <11 patient, with a crude incidence rate per 
1000 person-days of 1.39 (95% CI: 0.04 to 7.74). For other adverse event categories, crude incidence 
rates per 1000 person-days ranged from 2.81 (95% CI: 0.34 to 10.16) each for blood or lymphatic 
system disorders and nervous system disorders to 12.46 (95% CI: 5.38 to 24.55) for morbidity 
diagnoses. No adverse events were attributed to LCM by the treating physician. 
No adverse events were attributed to LCM by the treating physicians. 
Overall, no new safety concerns were observed, and the results of the study do not impact the current 
benefit-risk balance of LCM.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In this retrospective study, effectiveness and safety of LCM was evaluated in the acute treatment of 
neonatal seizures. 
Forty-seven neonates (<30 days of age) met the study eligibility criteria. Almost all of the neonates 
received their first dose of LCM in the ICU (n=46; 97.9%), and three-fifths of patients (n=29; 61.7%) 
received more than four administrations of LCM. The median (IQR) number of

days on LCM was 10.0 (1.0 - 28.0) days. Phenobarbital (n=37; 78.7%), fosphenytoin (n=29; 61.7%) 
and LEV (n=27; 57.4%) were the most commonly used AEDs before index date. 
Approximately 94% and 40% of the study patients had history of seizure and status epilepticus, 
respectively, before index date. About 21% of patients had status epilepticus on the index date. 
Reported underlying conditions were suspected epilepsy or seizure (n=16; 34%), intracranial 
hemorrhage (27.7%), sepsis (<11%), and meningitis (<11%). 
In most cases, EEG data were available for up to 3 days, as this was what was deemed clinically 
necessary for these patients. EEG data were available on day 1, day 2 and day 3 for 34, 26 and 21 
patients, respectively. In patients who were on LCM and did not receive any new AED,electrographic 
seizures were present on days 1, 2 and 3 in 31, <11 and <11patients, respectively. On days 1 and 2, 
any improvement in seizures was observed in <11 neonates and <11 neonate, respectively. 
The population included in this study was critically ill. During the median duration of follow up, ie, 12.0 
(7.0 - 28.0) days, <11 patients died. Cardiac arrest was observed in one patient. 
Various AEs occurred, the majority only in one patient. Hypotension and adrenal cortical hypofunction 
were reported in <11 patients each, congestive heart failure, hypertension, acute injury of the kidney 
and diabetes insipidus in <11 patients each. None of these events or deaths were attributed by the 
treating physician to LCM. No evidence of new safety concerns was found. 
The current study has limitations, ie, retrospective design, small sample size and the lack of a control 
arm. Comparative studies are required to enable any conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of 
LCM in neonatal seizures. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46, the MAH has provided the final study report of “Retrospective cohort 
study - pharmacokinetics and exposure outcome in neonates administered lacosamide”. In this 
retrospective study the primary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and effectiveness 
outcomes in neonates exposed to any dose of LCM in clinical practice and the secondary objectives 
were to estimate the incidence of the selected medical events of interest. 
Of the 47 patients in EP0155, the mean age at the index date was 13.9 days and the mean birthweight 
was 3.0 kg, respectively. The most common aetiology of first seizure was suspected epilepsy (34.0%), 
followed by intracranial haemorrhage (27.7%), and sepsis and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy 
(<11%each). On the index date, <11%of patients had status epilepticus. 
PK data was not available in the patient charts for most patients, only for <11 patients. No PK data is 
presented which is accepted, however in a future submission it is encouraged that the PK observations 
are reported.  
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of follow up for the effectiveness evaluation was 1.0 
(1.0 to 6.0) days and the median (IQR) duration of follow up for the adverse event evaluation was 
12.0 (7.0 to 28.0) days. Approximately 70% of patients had LCM used as a second or third line of 
therapy. The most commonly used (non-benzodiazepine) AEDs before the index date were 
phenobarbital (PB) (78.7%), fosphenytoin (61.7%), and levetiracetam (LEV) (57.4%). In most cases, 
electroencephalography (EEG) data were only available for up to 3 days, as this was what was deemed 
clinically necessary for these patients. The effectiveness based on EEG outcome was not possible to 
determine due to a small sample size and a high percentage of missing data.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/690309/2022

During the safety follow-up period of a median 12 days, <11 patients died, however none of the 
deaths were deemed related to lacosamide treatment but probably related to the severe background 
diseases (see above) for which lacosamide was given.  
The MAH considers that no change of the label is deemed necessary and that the results of the study 
do not impact the current benefit-risk balance of LCM. This is concurred.  
The Rapporteur concludes that the MAH has fulfilled its obligation to submit data from this paediatric 
study in accordance with Art 46. However, the small sample size, effectiveness evaluation based only 
on EEG data and a short safety follow up do not allow any evaluation of effectiveness or safety and 
accordingly, the results do not have any impact on the B/R balance of lacosamide. No further actions 
are required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

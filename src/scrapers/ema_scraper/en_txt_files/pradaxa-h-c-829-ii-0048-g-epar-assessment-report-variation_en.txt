Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0228/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the 
application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In 2008, dabigatran etexilate(DE) was approved in the EU for the primary prevention of VTE after total 
elective hip- or knee-replacement surgery. In 2010, DE was approved in the US and Canada to reduce 
the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (SPAF) and 
subsequently its US package insert has been changed to reflect that DE (150 mg twice daily) is superior 
in reducing ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes relative to warfarin (W). It was approved for SPAF in the 
EU, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in 2011.  
Within current grouped variation the results of 4 pivotal studies (1160.53 (RE-COVER), 1160.46 (RE-
COVER II), 1160.47 (RE-MEDY), and 1160.63 (RE-SONATE)) were submitted that according to the MAH 
established the effectiveness and safety of dabigatran etexilate (DE) for the:  
1. Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of 
related death ([aVTEt], RE-COVER I and II) 
and 
2. Prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and related 
death ([sVTEp], RE-SONATE and RE-MEDY).

The four pivotal studies in the development program were all randomized, double-blind Phase III studies, 
three of which were active-controlled (one warfarin- and one placebo- (P) controlled). The replicate 
studies 1160.53 (1,274 DE and 1,265 W patients treated) and 1160.46 (1,279 DE and 1,289 W patients 
treated) evaluated the efficacy and safety of DE for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) (DVT with or without PE). The other two studies, 1160.47 (1,430 DE and 1,426 W patients treated) 
and 1160.63 (681 DE and 662 P patients treated), evaluated the efficacy and safety of DE for the 
reduction of risk of recurrent VTE. The DE dose regimen was 150 mg b.i.d. for patients in these four 
studies. 
The plan for the aVTEt/sVTEp development program took into account the scientific advice feedback from 
the French and Swedish health authorities as well as scientific advice given during multiple interactions 
with the FDA. 
2.2.  Clinical pharmacology aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No clinical pharmacology studies or dose-response studies were performed to specifically support the 
sought indications. The efficacy of DE was demonstrated in four randomized, double-blind Phase III 
studies; three were active-controlled and one was placebo; two support the aVTEt indication, and two 
support the sVTEp indication. The figure presented below shows the overall design of the four studies and 
the patient flow from the acute studies to the prevention studies. 
GCP 
All clinical trial protocols were approved by institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. 
The trials followed the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and were conducted in 
accordance with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) standard operating procedures. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all patients. The CHMP has during the review of the dossier not identified any issues 
regarding GCP non-compliance requiring a triggered GCP inspection. 
Overview of clinical studies  
The efficacy and safety of DE was documented in four randomized, double-blind Phase III studies; three 
active controlled (warfarin) and one placebo-controlled. Two of the studies support the aVTEt indication, 
and two of the studies supported the sVTEp indication. 
The four studies are depicted below.

2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
There are no new data addressing absorption. No new formulations are introduced. 
Distribution 
There are no new data addressing distribution. 
Elimination 
There are no new data addressing elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
There are no new data addressing dose proportionality. Only one dose was investigated in the clinical 
trials (150 mg b.i.d.). In the PK/PD analysis of the RE-COVER study, the median trough plasma 
concentrations of total dabigatran for patients in the dabigatran group were consistent between Visit 4 
(58.7 ng/mL) and Visit 9 (60.2 ng/mL). There are no other new data addressing time dependency. 
Target population and special populations 
Since the PK/PD characteristics of DE in patients with non-valvular AF have been described in the 
previous submissions, only data from patient studies in the VTE indications sought in the current 
submission are presented. The review is further limited to one of the four pivotal Phase III studies, 
1160.53 (RE-COVER), since only in RE-COVER was PK/PD evaluated. 
The RE-COVER study was randomized, double blind (double dummy technique including use of sham 
INR), parallel-group, active-controlled study comparing two treatment groups (DE vs. warfarin) for 6 
months in 2500 patients, evenly randomized to the treatments warfarin (target INR 2.0 - 3.0) or DE 150

mg b.i.d. Patients received 150 mg DE b.i.d. after a minimum of 5 days previous therapy with a 
parenteral anticoagulant. Trough samples for PK and PD analysis were collected on Day 30 (Visit 4) and 
Day 180 (Visit 9), the last dosing. In addition to the scheduled sampling, unscheduled PK sampling was 
performed as soon as a symptomatic DVT, PE, MBE or acute renal failure was suspected. The primary 
goal of the investigations on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is the assessment of the PK/PD 
relationship of dabigatran in patients receiving DE for the treatment of acute symptomatic VTE of the leg 
or PE.  
The number of treated patients overall was 2539. Of those 1274 received DE, and from 850 patients at 
Visit 4 and 746 at Visit 9 PK/PD samples were taken. The median trough plasma concentrations of total 
dabigatran for patients in the DE group were consistent between Visit 4 (58.7 ng/mL) and Visit 9 (60.2 
ng/mL). The trough concentration of total dabigatran was associated with the creatinine clearance 
(CLCR), namely those with lower CLCR having higher dabigatran trough concentrations. At Visit 4, the 
gMean trough concentrations were 170 ng/mL in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLCR of 30 to 
<50 mL/min), 85.5 ng/mL in patients with mild impairment (CLCR of 50 to < 80 mL/min) and 50.5 
ng/mL in patients with normal renal function (CLCR of ≥80 mL/min). 
The trough concentration also increased with age, without further consideration of renal function; the 
lowest age group of 18 to < 40 years had the lowest gMean trough concentration (43.3 ng/mL) while 
patients of ≥75 years had the highest gMean trough concentration (121 ng/mL). Differences in the trough 
concentration of total dabigatran were also recorded for sex and body weight, though of clinically 
unimportant magnitude compared with renal function. The effect of covariates is summarized in Table 
2.1: 1, below. 
Assessment report

Page 7/146 
  
  
 
 
 
In summary, increased trough total dabigatran plasma concentrations were found in patients ≥75 years 
of age and patients with renal impairment CLCR <50 mL/min.  
Comparing CLCR subgroups of the RE-COVER patient population with AF patients from RE-LY, receiving 
DE at a dose of 150 mg b.i.d., it became apparent that the magnitude of effect by renal impairment was 
highly comparable between both patient populations (see Table 1.3.1: 1 below).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction study was conducted for the current application. The following results 
on drug-drug interactions are all from the PK/PD analysis of the RE-COVER study. The influence of proton 
pump inhibitor (PPI) co-medication on the resulting total dabigatran trough concentrations is outlined in 
Table 2.1: 2, below. In contrast to the expected effect of a reduced bioavailability, in RE-COVER the 
dabigatran trough levels were increased in patients on PPI co-medication. However, the effect on median 
trough levels never exceeded 25% and the 80% confidence interval was almost identical between both 
subgroups. 
P-gp inhibitor co-medication usage was relatively uncommon in this patient population. Only 27 treated 
patients (3.2%) had a P-gp inhibitor comedication at PK Visit 4 with verapamil being the most common P-
gp inhibitor used (N = 14 subjects on verapamil at Visit 4 and 11 subjects at Visit 9, respectively). The 
use of verapamil was associated with increased gMean dabigatran trough concentrations, as observed at 
Visit 4 and 9 (no verapamil use: 59.4 and 59.1 ng/mL, verapamil use: 82.4 and 97.3 ng/mL). Since only

patients on verapamil represented a sufficiently large sub-group in RE-COVER only effects by verapamil 
and all P-gp inhibitor co-medication are discussed. Consistent with previous data in RE-LY or from 
dedicated Phase I studies, verapamil or P-gp inhibitors increased dabigatran trough concentrations. The 
effects in RE-COVER are displayed in Table 2.1: 3. The verapamil effect also drives the date for all P-gp 
inhibitors as amiodarone does not (Visit 4, N = 3) or only marginally increase dabigatran troughs by at 
maximum 26.6% (Visit 9, N = 2). The magnitude of the effect by verapamil co-medication in RE-COVER 
was larger compared with RE-LY. 
It had been shown previously that the magnitude of interaction effect is dependent on relative dosing 
time (DE in relation to verapamil), the time being on verapamil (first dose different to multiple dosing of 
verapamil) and the formulation used (immediate- vs. extended release verapamil). With the available 
data it cannot be clarified whether a higher percentage of patients in RE-COVER had initiated verapamil, 
more of the verapamil immediate release formulation was used or whether more patients had taken 
verapamil concomitant or before DE. 
The inter-subject variability in the group of patients receiving verapamil or any P-gp inhibitor co-
medication is clearly increased (see Table 2.1: 3, below).

2.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dabigatran is a synthetic, non-peptide, competitive, oral direct thrombin inhibitor (oral DTI), that 
specifically and reversibly inhibits thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The mechanism 
of action of dabigatran involves the binding to exosite 1, the active site on thrombin. This binding 
subsequently prevents cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin and hence blocks the final step of the coagulation 
cascade and thrombus development. It reversibly inhibits fibrin-bound thrombin, free circulating thrombin 
and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. DE (DE) is the oral pro-drug of the active moiety dabigatran 
and does not possess any anticoagulant activity. The pro-drug DE is used in its salt form DE mesilate.  
No new data on mechanism of action have been submitted with the current application. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new data on primary pharmacology have been submitted with the current application. 
2.2.4.  PK/PD Modelling 
No PK/PD modelling was carried out as such. However, to further elucidate the exposure (i.e. total 
dabigatran trough plasma concentration) response relationship for the target indication, VTE, trough 
concentrations from Study 1160.53 (RECOVER), were related in a time to event analysis (over an 
observational period of 174 days) with the following two endpoints: 
1. For safety, major bleeding events (MBE) 
2. For efficacy, time to first recurrent symptomatic VTE and death related to VTE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 11/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The risk of a MBE was dependent on the trough concentration while no correlation could be observed 
between trough concentration and the prevention of recurrent VTE and VTE related death. The median 
trough concentration was consistently higher (Visit 4 and 9) in patients with major bleeding events (MBE) 
(79.9 and 100 ng/mL) than in patients without bleeding event (58.6 and 59.9 ng/mL).  
2.2.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP noted the extensive information about the pharmacokinetic performance of DE and dabigatran 
from  other  indications/development  programmes.  Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  samples  were  only  obtained  in 
one  of  the  four  pivotal  studies  supporting  the  sought  indication:  the  RE-COVER  study.  The  timing  and 
frequency of the PK sampling, the selection of subgroups and the overall presentation of the PK data are 
acceptable.  
The  PK  analysis  of  the  RE-COVER  study  is  largely  in  line  with  results  from  the  RE-LY  study.  Trough 
dabigatran  concentrations  by  the  three  categories  of  renal  function  are  similar  to  the  ones  obtained  for 
the 150 mg dose in the RE-LY study. The high dependence of dabigatran clearance on renal function, age 
and  P-gp  activity  is  confirmed.  Also  the  effect  of  gender  and  body  weight  on  dabigatran  is  in  line  with 
previous experience. The Applicant has provided a further analysis and discussion of the PK results of the 
RE-COVER  study.  There  was  a  more  than  2-fold  increase  in  dabigatran  exposure  in  patients  aged  80 
years or more compared to non-elderly patients, an about 3-fold increase in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) compared to patients without renal impairment, and an about 1.5-fold 
increase  in  patients  taking  verapamil  compared  to  patients  not  taking  verapamil.  Based  on  these  PK 
results and the clinical outcome data, the MAH agreed with reduced dose recommendations (daily dose of 
220 mg taken as two 110mg capsules) for patients aged 80 years or above and for patients who receive 
concomitant verapamil. 
Dabigatran  is  pharmacologically  well-characterized  with  regard  to  the  sought  indications.  Therefore,  the 
submitted new PK/PD information is very sparse. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Unlike the 
RE-LY study, the RE-COVER study only showed a relationship between trough dabigatran concentrations 
and  safety  (major  bleeding  events).  A  relationship  between  dabigatran  concentrations  and  efficacy 
(recurrent VTE, VTE related death) was not evident. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There  is  extensive  information  about  the  clinical  pharmacological  properties  of  DE  and  dabigatran  from 
other  indications/development  programmes.  Additional  information  from  the  current  programme  is 
limited. PK samples were only obtained in one of the four pivotal studies supporting the sought indication 
(RE-COVER  study).  The  PK  analysis  of  the  RE-COVER  study  is  consistent  with  results  from  the  RE-LY 
study. The high dependence of dabigatran clearance on renal function, age and P-gp activity is confirmed. 
The study showed a relationship between trough dabigatran concentrations major bleeding events, but a 
relationship between concentrations and efficacy endpoints (recurrent VTE, VTE related death) could not 
be shown. The dose recommendations in subgroups were challenged by the CHMP, and subsequently the 
Applicant accepted to align the dose recommendations for the aVTEt and sVTEp indications with those of 
the atrial fibrillation indication, i.e. a lower dose (110 mg BID) for patients aged 80 years and over and 
patients treated with verapamil, and this lower dose should also be considered for other subgroups, e.g. 
patients with moderate renal impairment. This was accepted by the CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.3.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose finding studies were performed. 
The clinical efficacy and safety data collected from the studies in orthopaedic surgery and atrial fibrillation 
(BISTRO-2, PETRO, and PETRO-EX), supplemented with pharmacokinetic and anticoagulation biomarker 
data, reassured the Applicant that DE at a dose of 150 mg b.i.d. would provide the right balance of 
efficacy and safety for the acute treatment of VTE and the prevention of its recurrence in the Phase III 
clinical studies; excessive bleeding had been noted at doses of 225 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg b.i.d in these 
Phase II studies, while there were no excess thromboembolic events at a dose of 150 mg b.i.d. 
2.3.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy and safety of DE was documented in four randomized, double-blind Phase III studies; three 
active controlled (W) and one placebo-controlled. Two of the studies support the aVTEt indication (acute 
studies), and two of the studies supported the sVTEp indication (prevention studies).

Methods 
The pivotal aVTEt studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II, replicate, active-controlled 
studies) were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies of the efficacy and safety of oral DE (150

mg b.i.d.) compared towarfarin(target INR 2.0-3.0) for 6 months of treatment of acute symptomatic 
venous thromboembolism following initial treatment (5-10 days) with a parenteral anticoagulant 
approved for this indication. The pivotal aVTEt studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 are replicate studies and will 
be described together as well as individually described where relevant. 
The study design and flowchart for the aVTEt studies are shown graphically below. 
Study participants 
Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with acute symptomatic unilateral or bilateral DVT of the leg involving 
proximal veins, and/or acute symptomatic PE confirmed by definitive objective clinical testing for whom at 
least 6 months of anticoagulant therapy was considered appropriate by the investigator and who provided 
written informed consent. 
Treatments 
The treatment period included a single-dummy period; patients were to receive parenteral therapy plus 
either warfarin or warfarin placebo for a planned 5 to 10 days or until INR values were ≥2.0 at 2 
consecutive measurements. Patients were then to enter a double-dummy period, during which they were 
to be randomized to receive either DE/W placebo or DE placebo/W while parenteral therapy was stopped.

Objectives 
To compare the safety and efficacy of oral DE (150 mg b.i.d.) and (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) for 6 month 
treatment of acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) following initial treatment (at least 5 
days) with a parenteral anticoagulant approved for this indication in patients with acute symptomatic 
unilateral or bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg involving proximal veins and / or pulmonary 
embolism (PE). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and deaths related to VTE. VTE was defined as the composite 
incidence of DVT (detected by venous compression ultrasonography or venography) and PE (detected by 
ventilation-perfusion lung scan, pulmonary angiography, or spiral [helical] CT). 
A VTE could be a DVT, a PE, both DVT and PE in the same patient, or a death resulting from one of those 
events. For DVT, diagnosis could be confirmed at autopsy or by either of 2 imaging modalities: a) 
compression ultrasound (CUS), a non-invasive assessment of venous blood flow in the veins of the pelvis 
and legs; and b) venography, an invasive technique in which radio-opaque contrast material was injected 
into the veins to determine if venous blood flow had been impaired or stopped by a thrombus. PE was to 
be diagnosed at autopsy or by using either non-invasive imaging with spiral computed tomography (CT), 
ventilation/perfusion radionuclide imaging (V/Q scan), or invasive pulmonary angiography, where radio-
opaque contrast material was injected into the pulmonary arterial circulation to determine if an occlusion 
was present. 
Secondary endpoints 
For the four pivotal studies, the following were investigated as secondary endpoints: 
•  Recurrent symptomatic VTE and all-cause deaths 
•  Recurrent symptomatic VTE excluding unexplained deaths (only for Study 1160.63) 
•  Symptomatic DVT 
•  Symptomatic PE 
•  VTE-related deaths 
•  All-cause deaths 
•  Unexplained deaths (only for Study 1160.63)* 
•  Note: Study 1160.63 excluded unexplained deaths from the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
“composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and VTE-related deaths.” Thus, the endpoint “unexplained 
deaths” was analyzed separately at the study level.  
Sample size 
For both studies 1160.53 and 1160.46, at least 2550 patients (1275 per treatment group) were to be 
included to obtain a minimum of 46 patients with confirmed recurrent VTE events. In a time-to-event 
analysis, the power is dependent on the number of observed events. In a study with a fixed duration of 
treatment, the number of observed events is dependent on the number of recruited patients, the event 
rate in the reference group, and the difference between treatment groups. These three factors also 
determine the power in an analysis of rates. The sample size of 1275 patients per treatment group was 
originally derived to achieve a sufficient power of at least 90% to claim non-inferiority with a hazard ratio 
margin of 2.75 for the 2% warfarin hazard rate over 6 months. The warfarin hazard rate of 2% was

Page 15/146 
  
  
 
 
 
based on the recent THRIVE study and similar to the rates observed in Levine et al., 1995 and Schulman 
et al., 1995. The power was based on one-sided tests with α = 0.025, and the dabigatran hazard rate is 
also assumed as 2% with an overall drop out of 20% during 6 months. The calculation utilized simulation 
assuming independent exponential distributions for events and drop-outs. 
Randomisation 
Patients found to be eligible were to be randomised within 72 hours of enrolment. Randomisation was 
performed at Visit 2, using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Patients were randomly assigned 
to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (W / DE placebo or W placebo /DE); the randomisation ratio was 1:1. 
Randomisation was stratified by active cancer at baseline and symptomatic PE at baseline (4 strata: 
'active cancer and symptomatic PE', 'active cancer, no symptomatic PE', 'no active cancer, symptomatic 
PE', 'no active cancer, no symptomatic PE') and was to be performed in blocks of 4 to prevent unequal 
treatment allocation. Active cancer was defined as a diagnosis of cancer (other than basal-cell or 
squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years before enrolment; any treatment for cancer within 5 
years before enrolment; or recurrent or metastatic cancer. During the conduct of the trial, the sponsor 
received knowledge that 'forced' randomization occurred at individual sites. This occurred when a site 
contacted IVRS to randomise a patient; however there was not sufficient blinded drug supply in storage 
at that site for one of the blinded treatment arms. As a result, forced randomisation of the patient to the 
other treatment group took place using the available study medication. The IVRS provider Almac Clinical 
Technologies then notified the TCM, but not the site, about the forced randomisation. The sponsor had 
allowed this process in the IVRS charter, but the IVRS provider was to avoid such cases by following up 
on the registering of drug supply by the site. Overall, such forced randomisation occurred for 18 patients; 
a list of these patients and the corresponding sites is stored in the CTMF. 
Blinding (masking) 
Since the 2 treatments differed in their appearance, blinding was achieved by using a doubledummy 
design with DE-matching placebo capsules and W-matching placebo tablets. INR values had to be 
monitored to guide the warfarin therapy; a sham INR procedure was used to prevent unintentional 
unblinding. INR measurements were to be performed using a point of care (POC) device. Note that in 
cases where the use of a POC device was not feasible for the monitoring of INR values, the INR could be 
measured in an unblinded manner by pre-specified individuals who then forwarded the unblinded INR to 
the IVRS. 
Statistical methods 
Rationale for the choice of the non-inferiority margins in aVTEt studies 
When the initial aVTEt studies were being designed, a superiority study over placebo was deemed 
unethical in this indication due to the life-threatening consequence of non-treatment. Further, a 
superiority study over warfarin was impractical as warfarin is known to be very effective. Therefore, non-
inferiority studies were planned, although at that time clinically defined non-inferiority margins had not 
been established in this indication. A non-inferiority margin derived by statistical methods is commonly 
based on estimates obtained from placebo-controlled studies. For aVTEt, oral anticoagulant therapy 
following initial therapy with heparin has been established, as evidenced by publications dated as early as 
1972. Therefore, due to the lack of placebo-controlled studies, BI decided to use the estimates of the 
effect of long-term warfarin treatment vs. short-term treatment as a conservative alternative for the 
aVTEt studies. A confidence interval (CI) from the meta-analysis of short-term warfarin (STW) vs. 
Assessment report

Page 16/146 
  
  
 
 
 
placebo, together with CI from the meta-analysis of long-term warfarin (LTW) vs. STW were used to 
determine an indirect estimate of LTW vs. placebo (Table 1.3.3: 3 presents details for RD and Table 
1.3.3: 4 for HR). Short-term was 4-6 weeks with a RD vs. placebo (P – STW) of 15.6% (6.8, 24.5) (Table 
1.3.3: 3); long-term was 3-6 months with a RD (STW – LTW) of 8.2% (5.7, 10.7) (Table 1.3.3: 3). The 
resulting RD for long-term warfarin vs. short-term placebo was indirectly estimated as (P – LTW) 23.8% 
(14.6, 33.0) (Table 1.3.3: 3). For the HR (and its 95% CI), short-term warfarin vs. placebo was 0.107 
(0.013, 0.854) with inverse 9.34 (1.17, 74.5) (Table 1.3.3: 1). Long-term vs. short-term was 0.146 
(0.071, 0.300), and the inverse short term/long term: 6.83 (3.34, 14.0) (Table 1.3.3: 2). The HR of long-
term vs. placebo was therefore indirectly estimated as 0.082 (95% CI 0.034, 0.195), and for placebo 
over W, the inverse, as 12.2 (95% CI 5.14, 29.2) (Table 1.3.3: 4). Therefore, using the terminology of 
the Draft FDA guidance for NI studies, M1=14.6% for RD of placebo minus W, and M1=5.14 for HR of W 
vs. placebo, for the acute VTE treatment studies, which correspond to the 95-95 fixed-margin approach. 
Tables 1.3.3: 1 through 1.3.3: 4 below show the historical data and meta-analyses for RD and HR.

Risk difference in aVTEt studies 
A margin of 3.6% (=M2) in RD was selected for these studies, preserving at least 75% of the effect of W, 
anchored at the lower boundary of the 95% CI (14.6%). This non-inferiority margin for the RD was in line 
with the margins that were used in other clinical studies in the same indication. Indeed, one portion of 
the analyses (first 4 weeks of warfarin therapy vs. placebo) utilized two studies that had 23 to 35 patients 
per arm. This small number of patients resulted in a wider CI for the estimate of warfarin effect over 
placebo. This, together with the fact that the overall effect had to be obtained as a combined estimate 
over two periods (LT vs. ST and ST vs. placebo), produced what was believed to be an appropriate NI 
margin at the time of the design of these studies. For example, comparison with putative placebo showed 
that the number of events being prevented is quite large even by a very low estimate of placebo rate 
derived from the lower bound of 95% in RD between warfarin and placebo. Another aspect contributing to 
the belief that a conservative margin was selected stemmed from the characteristics of the two small 
studies that were used to estimate the effect of ST W. One study compared warfarin over insufficiently 
effective treatment (heparin), not placebo; the other included distal DVT patients who are known to have 
a lower risk for recurrence. However, the use of these comparisons resulted in under-estimation of the 
effect of warfarin and, consequently, a very large sample size. In this sense, 2/3 of the bound, and even 
1/2 of the bound, was too conservative and would have led to a sample size which was beyond the 
feasibility limit for this indication. 
Hazard ratio in aVTEt studies  
Based on a review of the literature, BI proposed that 57% of the lower bound of the 95% CI in HR would 
be planned to be preserved. Thus, using the 95-95 fixed margin approach, M1=5.14 and M2=2.75, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 18/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
is defined as the non-inferiority margin. This margin required 1275 patients per group (a total of 2550) to 
have 90% power to declare non-inferiority with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 assuming a 2% 
event rate and 20% drop-out rate. The total sample size of 2550 patients was at the edge of the 
feasibility limit and slightly larger than in the THRIVE study, the largest study completed at the time the 
aVTEt studies were being designed. In addition, this non-inferiority margin for the HR was in line with the 
margins that were used in other clinical studies in the same indication. Details of the meta-analyses that 
were consulted, patient populations reviewed, and a summary of published results of relevant studies are 
provided in Sections 10.2.1 through 10.2.3 of the study protocols for Study 1160.53 and Study 1160.46. 
Based upon the historical meta-analysis data, which were included in the respective protocols for Studies 
1160.53 and 1160.46, and the actual results for these 2 studies, the amount of warfarin effect preserved 
is presented in Section 3.2.1.9, comparing the actual results with those of the historical meta-analysis.  
In conclusion, studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 were designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of DE vs. 
warfarin and, if non-inferiority could be demonstrated, to allow demonstration of superiority of DE over 
W. The tests for non-inferiority and superiority were performed in hierarchical order. Both analyses of the 
primary endpoint - RD at the end of treatment based upon Kaplan-Meier estimates, and HR based upon 
the Cox regression model - had to have the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI less than the pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin of 2.75 in order to meet non-inferiority according to these pre-defined thresholds. 
A margin of 3.6% (=M2) in RD was selected for these studies, preserving at least 75% of the effect of W, 
anchored at the lower boundary of the 95% CI (14.6%). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Study 1160.53 was a multi-centre, multinational study. Overall, 2630 patients were enrolled in 231 
centres in 29 countries worldwide; thereof, 228 centres randomised patients. Initially, there were 213 
centres in 27 countries. Due to slow recruitment, 37 centres in 3 countries (India, Israel, Turkey) were 
additionally initiated in 2008. Finland did not enrol any patients and stopped participation in this study in 
January 2008. The majority of randomised patients came from European countries. 
Stduy 1160.46 was an international, multi-centre study. Overall, 2701 patients were enrolled and 2589 
patients were randomised in 208 centres in 31 countries worldwide.  
There were 5331 enrolled patients in the pooled aVTEt studies. Of these, 178 patients (3.3%) were not 
randomized. Approximately 3 quarters of the 178 did not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria of their 
study and were appropriately not randomized; other reasons for not randomizing patients were loss to 
follow-up, consent withdrawn, adverse event, and “other.” Of the 5107 treated patients, 757 (14.8%)

prematurely discontinued study drug; similar frequencies discontinued in each treatment group. 
Discontinuations of study drug were most frequently due to AEs. Details are presented in Table 3.1.2.1: 
1. 
Roll-over status for aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46: Roll-over from the aVTEt studies into a sVTEp 
study was an option offered to patients whose investigators deemed that they would benefit from 
continuing anticoagulation therapy in 1 of the sVTEp studies. Of the 5107 patients treated in the pooled 
aVTEt studies, 1146 (22.4%) rolled over into Study 1160.47, with about equal numbers coming from the 
2 different treatment groups. Roll-over patients were re-randomized upon entering Study 1160.47. Of 
those who rolled over, about half were randomized to the opposite treatment arm in Study 1160.47 and 
half remained on the same treatment to which they had been randomized in the aVTEt study. A median 
duration of 1 day for DE patients and 2 days for warfarin patients elapsed between last dose of study 
drug in the aVTEt study and first dose in Study 1160.47; elapsed time was ≤30 days for > 95% of roll-
over patients. 
Recruitment 
In Study 1160.53, the first patient was entered on 7 April 2006; the last visit date for the last patient was 
22 May 2009. 
In Study 1160.46 the first patient was randomised on 17 June 2008; the last visit of the last patient was 
on 5 May 2011.

Conduct of the study 
Study 1160.53 (RECOVER) 
The original trial protocol (dated 18 November 2005) was amended globally on 4 occasions.  
Protocol Amendment 1 allowed alternative means of INR monitoring if use of the POC device was not 
feasible. In such cases, the INR could be measured in an unblinded manner by authorised personnel who 
then forwarded the unblinded INR value to the IVRS, while strictly maintaining the blinded status of all 
study site personnel involved in the conduct of the study (other than those assessing INRs in an 
unblinded manner); clarified that results of all central assessments by the HRP and ACS / AC were to be 
provided to the DSMB as soon as the adjudication results were available; and also Protocol Amendment 1 
(dated 27 March 2006) clarified that in patients who decided to participate in the RE-MEDY trial, 
participation in RE-COVER was concluded with the last intake of trial medication. Since Protocol 
Amendment 1 was issued before the first patient was enrolled (7 Apr 2006), the communication of 
adjudication results for LFT increases and ACS events followed the specifications made in this 
amendment.  
The main purpose of Protocol Amendment 2 was to contraindicate the concomitant administration of 
quinidine; If a moderate to strong Pglycoprotein inhibitor was to be concomitantly administered, it was 
recommended to separate the administration of dabigatran and the P-glycoprotein inhibitor by several 
hours. A list of Pglycoprotein inhibitors was added to the ISF.  
In amendment 3 (18 July 2008) an additional guidance was provided regarding the management of 
patients who required surgery or invasive procedures during the treatment period.  
Protocol Amendment 4 provided guidance on the concomitant administration of verapamil. 
Study 1160.46 (RE-COVER II) 
The original trial protocol (dated 8 October 2007) was amended globally on 6 occasions.  
The protocol amendment 1 clarified that the haematology and biochemistry variables needed to assess 
the patient's eligibility to participate in the study (serum creatinine, haemoglobin, platelet count, ALT, and 
AST) were to be obtained from a local laboratory. The results were to be documented on the CRF. This 
amendment became effective before the first patient was enrolled into the study on 17 June 2008.  
The main purpose of Protocol Amendment 2 was to contraindicate the concomitant administration of 
quinidine; a warning was added with regard to the potential role of P-glycoprotein inhibition on 
dabigatran plasma levels and subsequent tolerability.  
Protocol Amendment 3 was an additional guidance regarding the management of patients who required 
surgery or invasive procedures during the treatment period.  
Protocol Amendment 4 provided guidance on the concomitant administration of verapamil.   
Protocol Amendment 5, the systemic use of the P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole was contraindicated and the 
amendment also provided an updated list of substances tested in drug-drug interaction studies with DE. 
Further guidance for administration of strong P-gp-inducers was provided, stating that rifampicin and 
other strong P-gp inhibitors, such as carbamazepine and St. John’s Wart, were to be used with caution 
and only when no suitable alternative is available.  
Following Protocol Amendment 6, the recruitment period was extended by 5 months, hereby changing the 
planned end of trial date from February 2011 to July 2011.

Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics were similar among the 4 pivotal studies and between the treatment 
groups within studies. About half of the patients in the pivotal studies were male. No important 
differences were present between studies with regard to mean age (range: 54.6 yrs to 55.8 yrs) or mean 
BMI (range: 28.4 to 29.1 kg/m2). The percentages of White patients ranged from 77.6% to 94.8%. The 
highest percentage of Asian patients (20.9%) was in Study 1160.46, the lowest (2.6%) in Study 1160.53. 
The percentages of Asian patients in sVTEp Studies 1160.47 and 1160.63 were similar (7.9% and 9.3%). 
About 1.5% to 2.6% of patients per study were Black. Over half of the patients in each study were 
recruited in Western (17.4% to 55.2%) and Central Europe (25.0% to 34.1%).The demographic 
characteristics in the pooled aVTEt studies were nearly identical in the DE and warfarin groups.

In the pooled aVTEt studies, the patients' medical history was similar between the treatment groups. The 
two most common categories of conditions noted were hypertension (35.5%) and diabetes mellitus 
(9.0%). There were no important between-group differences for any of the categories. 
Concomitant medications in the pooled and individual aVTEt studies 1160.46 and 1160.53 
Assessment report

In the pooled aVTEt studies, 28.7% of patients used antithrombotic medication, platelet inhibitors, or 
NSAIDs concomitantly with study drug (DE: 30.2%, W: 27.3%). The most frequently used concomitant 
medications were NSAIDs (21.7%) and ASA (9.2%). Cardiovascular medications: In the pooled aVTEt 
studies, 52.4% of patients used cardiovascular therapy concomitantly; most frequently reported were 
vasodilators (28.5%), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (24.7%), serum lipidreducing 
agents (19.1%), beta-blocking agents (14.8%), and calcium-channel blockers (9.7%). P-gp 
inhibitors/inducers: In the pooled aVTEt studies, concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors was reported by few 
patients (2.0%); most frequent were verapamil (1.2% overall) and amiodarone (0.4% overall). The 
concomitant use of P-gp inducers (0.7% overall) was less frequent.  
The use of concomitant antithrombotic medication, platelet inhibitors, NSAID, cardiovascular medications 
and P-gp inhibitors/inducers was similar between treatment groups as well as in the individual aVTEt 
studies. 
Risk factors for recurrent VTE  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 24/146 
  
  
 
 
 
Risk factors for recurrent VTE are presented below in Table 3.1.3.3:1: 
The total number of patients with risk factors for VTEs was similar for Studies 1160.53 (69.4%) and 
1160.47 (66.7%). Previous VTE accounted for the greatest proportion of the risk factors in the pivotal 
studies. The frequency of previous VTE as a risk factor was highest in patients in Study 1160.63 (99.9%), 
followed by patients in Studies 1160.47 (53.4%) and 1160.53 (25.6%). In total, 17.5% of patients in 
Study 1160.46 reported previous VTE; however, only in this study did the investigators clearly exclude 
the qualifying VTE event from the number of previous VTE according to the eCRF. In the other 3 pivotal 
studies the qualifying event could have been excluded from or included in the number of previous VTEs. 
Characteristics of the qualifying VTE event in aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46: In the pooled aVTEt 
studies, 68.5% of patients had only symptomatic DVT as their qualifying VTE event, 22.2% had only 
symptomatic PE, and 9.1% had both symptomatic DVT and PE. The index event was not confirmed by 
objective clinical testing by the investigator for 6 patients (0.1%) with symptomatic DVT or symptomatic

PE at baseline. For the individual aVTEt studies, there were no major differences between studies or 
between treatments within each study. 
Compliance 
In the pooled aVTEt studies, the rates of non-compliant patients (outside the range of 80% to 120% for 
at least 2 consecutive visits) were low for patients who received DE and DE-matching placebo (2.1% 
each). Comparable rates were observed for the individual aVTEt studies.  
Warfarin patients had a mean of 1.9 INR measurements per month. The overall mean TTR (INR 2.0-3.0) 
was 58.0% (median 60.6%) (Table 3.1.7: 1). Periods during which warfarin was withheld (unless the 
reason was “INR too high or too low”) were excluded from the calculation of TTR. For the INR range of 
1.8 to 3.2, the overall mean TTR was 72.9% (median 77.2%), and was 90.6% (median 96.2%) for the 
INR range of 1.5 to 4.0.

Outcomes and estimation 
The main objectives of the pooled analysis of aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 were the overall 
estimate of the HR (Cox proportional hazards model) and its 95% CI for the incidence of VTE and VTE-
related death between DE and W. Additionally, KM plots were prepared for the primary endpoint, defined 
as the composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and VTE-related deaths.  
Both analyses of the primary endpoint - RD at the end of treatment based upon Kaplan-Meier estimates, 
and HR based upon the Cox regression model - had to have the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI less 
than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin in order to meet non-inferiority according to these pre-
defined thresholds. 
A non-inferiority margin of 2.75 in hazard ratio and 3.6% in RD was selected for these studies, preserving 
at least 75% of the effect of W, anchored at the lower boundary of the 95% CI (14.6%).  
The primary endpoint occurred at a similar rate in both treatment groups (DE: 2.7%; W: 2.4%). The 
heterogeneity p-value was non-significant; homogeneity was assumed and a common treatment effect 
was used for both studies. The HR of DE vs. W was 1.09 with an accompanying 95% CI of 0.77 to 1.54. 
Both treatments were, therefore, assumed to be similar with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Results for the ITT analysis and other sensitivity analyses were consistent with those reported here. The 
KM curves for the primary endpoint were nearly congruent and crossed at multiple points (Figure 3.2.1.2: 
1). For both treatment groups, the curves indicated a higher risk of VTE recurrence in the 2-month period 
immediately after the initial symptomatic VTE. The KM curves for the ITT analysis and other sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with those presented below. An excess of 0.4 events (VTE and VTE-related 
deaths) in 100 patient-years of treatment would be expected for patients on DE vs. Warfarin (Table 
2.1.5.1 below).

Results from the individual studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 are presented below:  
In Study 1160.53, the primary endpoint occurred at a similar rate in both treatment groups (DE: 2.7%; 
W: 2.5%). The HR was 1.05 with a corresponding p-value for non-inferiority <0.0001. The upper 
boundary of the CI was well below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 2.75 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.70). 
The KM curves for the primary endpoint were nearly congruent (Figure 3.2.1.3: 1). For both treatment 
groups, the curves were steeper in the first 2 months and became flatter thereafter. The cumulative risk

for the primary endpoint at 6 months was 2.4% in the DE group and 2.2% in the W group (Table 3.2.1.3: 
1). The RD was 0.4% (95% CI −0.7, 1.5). The upper limit of the CI of the RD was below the pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin of 3.6%. The p-value for the test for non-inferiority was <0.0001. Based on the RD 
of 0.4, one would expect an excess of 0.2 events (VTE and VTE-related deaths) in 100 patient-years of 
treatment on DE vs. W.  
In Study 1160.46, the primary endpoint, recurrent symptomatic VTE and VTE-related deaths (excluding 
unexplained deaths) until the end of post-treatment period, occurred at a similar rate in both treatment 
groups (DE: 2.7%; W: 2.3%). The HR vs W was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.85). The p-value for non-
inferiority was 0.0002. The cumulative risk for the primary endpoint at 6 months was 2.4% in the DE 
group and 2.2% in the warfarin group (Table 3.2.1.4: 1). The RD was 0.2% (95% CI -1.0, 1.3). The p-
value for the test for non-inferiority was 0.0001. Based on the RD of 0.2, one would expect an excess of 
0.6 events (VTE and VTE-related deaths) in 100 patient-years of treatment on DE vs. W.

Ancillary analyses 
With regard to the key secondary endpoint of symptomatic VTE and all-cause death, DE was non-inferior 
to warfarin in the 3 active-controlled studies and superior to placebo in Study 1160.63. 
Pooling of aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 
The secondary endpoint, recurrent symptomatic VTE and all-cause deaths (including unexplained deaths), 
occurred at a similar rate in both treatment groups (DE: 4.3%; W: 4.1%). The HR of DE vs. W was 1.04 
with an accompanying 95% CI of 0.80, 1.37. There was no statistically significant treatment difference 
between DE and warfarin in the pooled aVTEt studies. The test for heterogeneity resulted in a p-value of 
0.6049; thus it can be concluded that the effect of treatment was similar in both aVTEt studies. 
The KM curves of the 2 treatment groups for the key secondary endpoint were nearly congruent and 
crossed multiple times (Figure 3.2.2.1: 1). For both treatment groups, the estimated cumulative risk 
increased slowly and continuously over the course of the study. The composite endpoint of VTE and all-
cause deaths was also assessed by incidence of the most severe component. The incidences of each 
component were similar among the treatment groups. Death accounted for most of the events (DE: 
2.00%, W: 2.04%), followed by symptomatic DVT (DE: 1.45%, W: 1.21%) and PE (0.82% each).

In Study 1160.53, the cumulative risks and RDs were also assessed by stratification factor and stratum. 
As expected, the cumulative risk for the key secondary endpoint was higher for patients with initial 
symptomatic PE (DE, 5.2%; W, 4.4%) than for patients without PE (3.2% each). Patients with active 
cancer at baseline had a higher cumulative risk for the key secondary endpoint (DE: 13.0%, W: 14.3%) 
than patients without active cancer at baseline (3.4% vs. 3.0%), which was also as expected. For the RD 
between treatment groups in patients with/without initial symptomatic PE and with/without cancer, all CIs 
included 0, indicating that there was no important statistical difference in cumulative risks between 
treatment groups. 
In Study 1160.46, the cumulative risks and RDs were also assessed by stratification factor and stratum. 
The cumulative risk for the key secondary endpoint was lower for patients with initial symptomatic PE 
(DE: 3.5%, W: 3.5%) than for patients without PE (DE: 4.3%, W: 3.9 %). Patients with active cancer at 
baseline had a higher cumulative risk for the key secondary endpoint (DE: 24.8%, W: 24.9%) than 
patients without active cancer at baseline (3.2% vs. 2.9%), which was as expected. For the RD between 
treatment groups in patients with/without initial symptomatic PE and with/without cancer, all CIs included 
0, indicating that there was no important statistical between-treatment difference in cumulative risks. 
The composite endpoint of VTE and all-cause deaths was also assessed by incidence of the most severe 
component. The incidences of each component were similar among the treatment groups. Death 
accounted for most of the events (DE: 2.00%, W: 2.04%), followed by symptomatic DVT (DE: 1.45%, W: 
1.21%) and PE (0.82% each), (Table 2.2.5.1):

Other secondary endpoints: 
•  Symptomatic DVT 
•  Symptomatic fatal and non-fatal PE 
•  VTE-related deaths 
•  All-cause deaths 
The frequencies of the different secondary endpoints were similar for the DE and warfarin groups in the 
pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 and in the individual Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 (Table 
3.2.3.1: 1). The CIs widely overlapped for each of the secondary endpoints.

Comparison of results in sub-populations 
The analyses of efficacy in pre-specified subgroups were performed for the primary endpoint VTE and 
VTE-related deaths.  
Subgroup analyses were performed to detect interactions between treatment and the following 
demographic/baseline characteristics:

No interactions were detected between treatment and any of the factors analyzed (nominal p-values were 
all >0.10), except for items 1 through 4 below. None of these exceptions were considered clinically 
important, and all but item 3 below may be chance findings since multiple comparisons have been made: 
1.  In pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 a possible interaction was detected between treatment 
and age <75 vs. ≥75 years for those who experienced VTE or VTE-related death (p=0.0517). Among 
those <75 years old, 65/2265 (2.9%) DE patients and 52/2239 (2.3%) warfarin patients experienced 
VTE or VTE-related death. Among those ≥75 years old, 3/288 (1.0%) DE patients and 10/315 (3.2%) 
warfarin patients experienced VTE or VTE-related death. The same interaction was detected for 
individual Study 1160.46 (p=0.1046). 
2.  In pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 a possible interaction was detected between treatment 
and age <80 vs. ≥80 years for those who experienced VTE or VTE-related death (p=0.0956). Among 
those <80 years old, 67/2418 (2.8%) DE patients and 57/2429 (2.3%) warfarin patients experienced 
VTE or VTE-related deaths. Among those ≥80 years old 1/135 (0.7%) DE patients and 5/125 (4.0%) 
warfarin patients experienced VTE or VTE-related deaths. 
3.  To confirm that there were no age groups in which the efficacy of warfarin was significantly different 
from that of DE, age as a continuous variable was also analyzed. In aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 
1160.46 and in sVTEp Study 1160.47 there appeared to be a tendency for DE to have better efficacy 
at higher ages but it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions because at all ages, the 95% CIs for 
the estimated hazard ratio included 1.0, and the interaction was not statistically significant. In the 
pooled aVTEt studies and in the individual aVTEt studies, when age was analyzed as a continuous

variable, compared with W, the efficacy of DE was lower in younger patients and higher in older 
patients, with equal efficacy at about age 60 (Figure 3.3.1:1): 
4.  In pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 a possible interaction was detected between treatment 
and history of smoking for VTE and VTE-related death (p=0.0430; from Wald Chi square test of 
treatment-by-smoking-status interaction effect). In this pooling the percentages of DE patients who 
never smoked, were ex-smokers, or current smokers who had events were 1.9% (26 patients), 3.2% 
(21 patients), and 3.8% (21 patients) vs. 2.3% (31 patients), 3.4% (23 patients) and 1.4% (8 
patients), respectively, for warfarin patients. This finding appears to be driven by Study 1160.46, in 
which VTE and VTE-related death occurred among current smokers in 4.3% of the DE-treated 
patients compared to 1.1% of W-treated patients. This finding was not apparent in Studies 1160.63 
or 1160.47. Inspection of the frequency data showed no especially high rates of VTE or VTE-related 
deaths, or of PE, associated either with particular subgroups receiving the same treatment or 
differences in the occurrence rates in subgroups receiving different treatments. Likewise, the Cox 
Regression analysis showed no additional interaction factors between treatment and subgroup (all p-
values from the Chi-square tests for treatment interaction factor effect were >0.05). 
Subgroups based on characteristics associated with the index event 
Subgroup analyses were performed to detect potential interactions between the following 4 characteristics 
associated with the index event and: a) the primary outcome of VTE and VTE-related death, and b) the 
secondary outcome of PE: 
•  Asymptomatic PE at baseline 
•  Symptomatic PE as index event 
•  Open-label parenteral therapy for the index event (used ≤9 days or > 9 days);  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 37/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Only one of the analyses detected a possible interaction between treatment and any of the 4 
characteristics associated with the index event, either for VTE and VTE-related deaths or for PE; nominal 
p-values were all >0.10 except for asymptomatic PE at baseline in aVTEt Study 1160.46. 
In aVTEt Study 1160.46, a possible interaction was detected between treatment and asymptomatic PE at 
baseline for those who experienced VTE or VTE-related death (p=0.0580). Among those without 
symptomatic PE at baseline, 23/881 (2.6%) of DE patients and 20/874 (2.3%) of warfarin patients, 
experienced VTE or VTE-related death. Among those with asymptomatic PE at baseline, 11/393 (2.8%) of 
DE patients and 12/391 (3.1%) of warfarin patients, experienced VTE or VTE-related deaths. This may be 
a chance finding since multiple analyses have been performed. 
Risk factors for VTE 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to detect potential interactions between treatment and medical 
histories known to constitute risk factors for recurrent VTE for a) the primary outcome of VTE and VTE-
related death; b) the secondary outcome of PE; and c) VTE and VTE-related deaths.  
Previous VTE prior to index event 
Thrombophilia (Note: many patients were not tested for thrombophilia) 
•  Active cancer at any time (at baseline or newly diagnosed during study) 
• 
• 
•  History of venous insufficiency (in aVTEt studies only) 
•  History of prior significant coronary artery disease 
•  History of prior MI 
•  History of diabetes mellitus 
•  History of bleeding events (history of major or clinically relevant bleeding events, history of rectal 
bleeding, history of frequent nose bleeds, or history of hematuria) 
• 
Idiopathic VTE (no identified risk factors such as active cancer at any time, previous VTE, 
thrombophilia, history of venous insufficiency, prolonged immobilization, long distance travel, 
surgery/trauma, recent systemic use of estrogens, and recent pregnancy). 
There were no interactions between treatment and the other risk factors analyzed with the following 
exceptions, none of which were considered clinically important, and all of which may be chance findings 
since multiple comparisons have been made:  
Of the patients without prior VTE, 44/1978 (2.2%) of DE patients and 51/2130 (2.5%) of warfarin 
patients were reported with the endpoint VTE or VTE-related death. Of those with prior VTE, 24/575 
(4.2%) of DE patients and 11/524 (2.1%) of warfarin patients were reported with the endpoint VTE or 
VTE-related death.  
In the pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46, a possible interaction was detected between 
treatment and history of prior coronary artery disease for VTE and VTE-related deaths (p=0.0445). Of 
those with prior coronary artery disease, 2/165 (1.2%) of DE patients and 9/184 (4.9%) of warfarin 
patients were reported with the endpoint VTE and VTE-related death. 
No drug-drug interactions were detected between treatment and the 4 categories of concomitant 
medications analyzed: 
P-gp inhibitors 
• 
•  ASA 
•  NSAIDS 
•  Anticoagulants 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 38/146 
  
  
 
 
 
Nominal p-values were >0.10 for all analyses of drug-drug interactions with one exception. In aVTEt 
Study 1160.53, a possible interaction was detected between treatment and concomitant use of NSAIDs 
for those who experienced VTE or VTE-related death (p=0.1070). Among those who did not take NSAIDs 
concomitantly, 26/980 (2.7%) of DE patients and 30/1018 (2.9%) of warfarin patients, experienced VTE 
or VTE-related death. Among those who received NSAIDs concomitantly 8/294 (2.7%) of DE patients and 
2/247 (0.8%) of warfarin patients experienced VTE-or VTE-related death. 
Multivariate subgroup analyses 
Multivariate subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint, centrally adjudicated 
VTE and VTE-related deaths, for the pooled aVTEt Studies 1160.46 and 1160.53. A Cox proportional 
hazards model included the factors age, gender, geographical region, race, BMI, and creatinine clearance 
as main effects and interaction with treatment. Age, BMI and creatinine clearance were included in the 
model as continuous variables. The final model was selected using the backward elimination technique 
with a p-value criterion of 0.2 for the likelihood ratio test. Main effects that had significant interactions 
were not removed from the model. Gender, BMI and race were eliminated from the final model. Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation among age, BMI, and creatinine clearance to 
validate the variable selection procedure. 
The Cox regression analyses indicated no interactions. Within the frequency tables, values over the 10% 
threshold had only very small numbers of patients in individual data cells, with no apparent trends and 
minimal difference between the treatment groups. The estimates of the HR for adjudicated VTE and VTE-
related deaths for different ages derived from the final model decreased with increasing age, although the 
95% CIs included 1.0. 
Prevention Study 1160.47 (RE-MEDY) 
Methods 
Study 1160.47 (RE-MEDEDY, active-controlled study) evaluated the secondary prevention of recurrent 
VTE (sVTEp)  (treatment duration: 6-36 months) and enrolled adult patients with acute symptomatic 
proximal DVT or PE who had received anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 12 months or who had completed 
participation in studies 1160.53 or 1160.46. 
The study design and flowchart for the study is shown graphically below.

Study participants 
Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with objectively confirmed symptomatic uni- or bilateral DVT of the leg 
involving proximal veins or PE, treated with an approved anticoagulant therapy or with study drug taken 
during participation in the RE-COVER trial for 3 to 6 months at the time of screening, considered at 
increased risk of recurrent VTE (proximal veins are: trifurcation area, popliteal, superficial femoral, deep 
femoral, common femoral and iliac vein). 
Following Protocol Amendment 2, dated 15 March 2007, the specified duration of prior anticoagulant 
therapy was changed to 3 to 12 months. Following Protocol Amendment 6, dated 12 December 2008, 
patients who had completed the RE-COVER II trial were allowed to enter into RE-MEDY. 
Treatments 
The investigational product in this trial was DE 150 mg b.i.d.. Warfarin was the active comparator. Table 
9.4.1.1: 1 summarises the information about the investigational product used in this trial.

Objectives 
This trial aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority of DE compared with warfarin for the secondary prevention 
of symptomatic VTE. If non-inferiority could be demonstrated, this trial also aimed to establish superiority 
of DE over W.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and deaths related to VTE. 
VTE was defined as the composite incidence of DVT of the leg (including the inferior vena cava) and PE. 
All recurrent VTEs required objective verification by definitive diagnostic evaluation. All suspected DVTs 
had to be confirmed by venous compression ultrasonography (CUS) or venography. All suspected PEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 41/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
required confirmation by one of the following: ventilation-perfusion (VQ) lung scan, pulmonary 
angiography, or spiral (helical) CT. 
In case of death, autopsy was an additional way to confirm VTE. All objective tests for suspected VTE 
were to be centrally adjudicated by an Independent Central Adjudication Committee (ICAC/VTE). In 
addition, all deaths were to be reviewed for evidence of fatal PE or bleeding, and all events that 
contributed to the primary endpoint (or its components) were adjudicated. Adjudicated results were used 
in the analyses.  
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are listed below. 
•  Composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE (fatal and non-fatal) and all deaths 
•  Symptomatic DVT 
•  Symptomatic PE (fatal or non-fatal) 
•  Deaths related to VTE (i.e. fatal PE) 
•  All deaths 
Statistical methods and sample size 
The tests for non-inferiority and superiority were performed in hierarchical order. The non-inferiority 
margins were chosen to be 2.85 for the hazard ratio (δr) and 2.8% for the risk difference (δd). By 
requiring fulfilment of both margins, it was assured that DE preserved at least 70% of the warfarin effect 
versus placebo (based on the point estimate) with regard to the hazard ratio and at least 2/3 with regard 
to the risk difference (based on the lower bound of 95% confidence interval) if proven to be not inferior to 
W. This margin required a sample size of 1000 patients per group (a total of 2000) to have a power of at 
least 85% with one-sided α=0.025. 
Please also refer to description of statistical methods for the aVTEt studies. 
Randomisation 
An IVRS was used to randomly assign patients to one of 2 treatment groups with a randomisation ratio of 
1:1. Randomisation was stratified into 4 cells resulting from the combination of 2 stratification factors 
active cancer (yes/no) and symptomatic PE (yes/no). To prevent unequal treatment allocation, blocks of 
4 were used and the blocks were assigned to strata. Active cancer was defined as a diagnosis of cancer 
(other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years before the enrolment; any 
treatment for cancer within 5 years; or recurrent or metastatic cancer. The randomisation schedule was 
generated using validated software and verified by a Boehringer Ingelheim statistician who was not 
involved in the planning or performance of the trial. The access to the randomization code was to be 
supervised by Clinical Trial Support (Medical Data Services). 
Blinding (masking) 
Study 1160.47 employed a double-blind design; neither the patient nor the investigator was informed 
about the allocated treatment. In addition, the personnel involved in the conduct or assessment of the 
study were unaware of the treatment allocation for the entire duration of the study until the final 
database was locked. Since the 2 treatments differed in their appearance, blinding was achieved by using 
a double-dummy design with DE-matching placebo capsules and W-matching placebo tablets. INR values

had to be monitored to guide the warfarin therapy; a sham INR procedure was used to prevent 
unintentional unblinding. INR measurements were to be performed using a POC device or alternative. 
Results 
Participant flow 
RE-MEDY was an international, multi-centre study. Overall, 2918 patients were enrolled in 261 centres in 
33 countries worldwide. The majority of randomized patients came from European countries. Centres in 
Asian countries joined later in the trial and recruited more patients towards the end of the trial. Of the 
2918 patients enrolled, 52 patients (1.8%) were not randomised. The most frequent reason for non-
randomisation was a violation of the inclusion or exclusion criteria (1.1%). A total of 2866 patients were 
randomised to either DE (1435 patients) or warfarin (1431 patients). Of the randomised patients, 10 
patients were not treated with study medication (5 patients of each treatment group): 5 patients refused 
to take study medication and 1 patient was non-compliant with the study protocol (patient no. 9469 took 
part in a different clinical trial). Four patients were reported with 'other' reasons. Of the 2856 treated 
patients, 93.8% completed the planned observation time, and there were no between-group differences 
for those patients who did not (Table 10.1: 2).

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled into this study on 26 July 2006; the last visit of the last patient in this study 
was on 8 October 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
The original trial protocol (dated 20 January 2006) was amended globally on 9 occasions. As per original 
trial protocol, INR measurements during the study were to be performed using a sponsor-supplied POC 
device, which provided an encryptet INR. Study site personnel had to obtain an unencrypted INR value by 
calling into an IVRS system (true INR for patients randomized to warfarin / sham INR for patients 
randomized to warfarin placebo). 
Protocol Amendment 1 allowed alternative means of INR monitoring if use of the POC device was not 
feasible. In such cases, the INR could be measured in an unblinded manner by authorized personnel who 
then forwarded the unblended INR value to the IVRS, while strictly maintaining the blinded status of all 
study site personnel involved in the conduct of the study (other than those assessing INRs in an 
unblinded manner). In addition, Amendment 1 introduced several clarifications and corrections of minor 
errors.  
Protocol Amendment 2 extended the required time period of previous anticoagulant therapy prior to entry 
into the RE-MEDY trial from 3 to 6 months to 3 to 12 months. This change follows the guidelines of the 
7th ACCP Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy, which state that for patients at highest risk 
of recurrent VTE, a minimum of 6 to 12 months therapy is recommended. Secondly, the investigator was 
given the option of using bridging therapy with LMWH for patients who had just completed participation in 
RE-COVER or RE-COVER II and were beginning participation in RE-MEDY.  
Protocol Amendment 3 extended the recruitment period by 7 months, thereby changing the planned end 
of trial date from December 2009 to July 2010. The schedule of Liver Function Test (LFT) Monitoring was 
changed, with Mandatory Visits 5, 7 and 8 being replaced by mandatory phone calls.  
Protocol Amendment 4 was introduced with the main purpose to contraindicate the concomitant 
administration of quinidine. A warning was added regarding the potential role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
inhibition on DE plasma levels and subsequent tolerability.  
Protocol Amendment 5 provided additional guidance regarding the management of patients who required 
surgery or invasive procedures during the treatment period. Clarifications were made regarding the 
discontinuation of study treatment for patients with severe renal dysfunction.  
Protocol Amendment 6 changed the planned treatment duration from 18 months to 6 to 36 months, and 
the number of patients to be recruited was increased, with recruitment to occur through no later than 
31st of December 2009. Based on the protocol-specified review of the overall primary endpoint event 
rate, this amendment was undertaken to ensure a power of 80 %. As a result, 3 'cohorts' of patients were 
included in the study. First, patients who completed the trial prior implementation of this amendment or 
those not willing to consent to participate as per this amendment; such patients had a planned treatment 
duration of 18 months. Second, patients who were randomised prior to implementation of this 
amendment and who consented to trial participation as per this amendment; such patients had a planned 
treatment duration of between 18 and 36 months. Third, patients randomised after implementation of 
this amendment but enrolled within 18 months of the planned study close-out; these patients had a 
planned treatment duration of 6 to <18 months. Because of the changes in planned trial duration and 
patient recruitment, the visit schedule was changed. Protocol Amendment 6 specified the statistical 
Assessment report

methods to be used for non-inferiority and superiority testing in this trial given the changes in the 
planned treatment duration and patient recruitment. The second major change introduced by Protocol 
Amendment 6 was to allow inclusion of patients of RE-COVER II (Study 1160.46), a replicate trial of RE-
COVER. Thirdly, clarifications regarding physical examination requirements were provided. 
Protocol Amendment 7, 8 and 9 provided guidance on the concomitant administration of the P-gp 
inhibitor verapamil (Protocol Amendment 7), contraindication of the systemic use of the P-gp inhibitor 
ketokonazole and guidance regarding co-administration of the P-gp inducer rifampicin and an updated list 
of substances tested in drug-drug interaction studies with DE (Amendment 8), and updated guidance for 
administration of strong P-gp-inducers stating that rifampicin and other strong P-gp inhibitors, such as 
carbamazepine and St. John’s Wort, were to be used with caution and only when no suitable alternative is 
available (Amendment 9). 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were balanced with regard to their demographics and baseline characteristics, with 
an overall mean age of 54.6 years (range: 18 to 93 years). More than half of all patients (61.0%) were 
male and most patients (90.1%) were of white ethnicity (Table 11.2.1: 1). Concomitant medication is 
presented in Tables 11.2.6.2:1-4.

Compliance: The rates of non-compliance with DE / matching placebo capsules were low in both 
treatment groups. The percentage of non-compliant patients was 2.0% in the DE treatment group and 
1.8% in the warfarin group; the weighted mean compliance for the on-treatment period was 97.1% in the 
DE group and 96.7% in the warfarin group. Mean TTR during the first month of therapy was 51.9%. The 
mean percentage of patient time in the INR target range increased over time. The mean and median TTR 
over the entire study was 61.5% and 65.3%, respectively. For an overview of the percentage of patients' 
time within TTR in the different time periods refer to Table 11.3: 1.

Outcomes and estimation 
The number of patients with events contributing to the primary endpoint during the planned treatment 
period was 26 in the DE group and 18 in the warfarin group. The primary outcome event was most 
commonly symptomatic DVT (17 vs. 13 patients), followed by symptomatic PE (10 vs. 5 patients). One 
DE patient had 2 primary outcome events at the same day (while no warfarin patient did): patient no. 
7275 had a symptomatic DVT and a symptomatic PE at the same day. Two patients (1 in each treatment 
group) were reported with a VTE-related death (i.e. fatal PE): patient no. 7275 (DE group) died 3 days 
after the onset of the symptomatic DVT and PE; patient no. 9100 (W group) died 1 month after the onset 
of a symptomatic PE. For both patients, the onset of the symptomatic VTE event (and not the date of 
death) was counted in the time- to-event analysis of the primary endpoint. A summary of patients with 
events and events contributing to the primary endpoint is given in Table 11.4.1.1.1: 1.

The 44 patients with primary outcome events during the planned treatment period were assigned to the 
cohorts as follows: 32 patients were in Cohort 1 (DE: 18 patients, W: 14 patients), 7 patients were in 
Cohort 2 (4 vs. 3 patients), and 5 patients were in Cohort 3 (4 vs. 1 patients). Because of the low 
number of events in Cohorts 2 and 3, not all strata and cohorts were evaluable separately as planned for 
the meta-analysis approach of the primary analysis. Cohorts 1 and 2 were pooled to obtain the risk 
differences per stratum; for Cohort 3 the risk difference was estimated overall and not per stratum. The 
hazard ratio between DE and warfarin was estimated within each cohort (with treatment and symptomatic 
PE as factors in the Cox regression model) as planned. 
The hazard ratio of the primary endpoint of DE versus warfarin was 1.44 (95% CI 0.78, 2.64). Since the 
upper bound of the confidence interval was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 2.85 (p-value 
for non-inferiority: 0.0137), the null hypothesis of inferiority of DE versus warfarin could be rejected. 
Based on the results for the hazard ratio, it was concluded that DE was non-inferior to W. Table 
11.4.1.1.1: 2 summarises the results. 
The cumulative risk for the primary endpoint at 18 months was 1.74% in the DE group and 1.38% in the 
warfarin group (Table 11.4.1.1.1: 3). The risk difference for DE vs. W was 0.38% (95% CI -0.50, 1.25). 
The upper limit of the confidence interval of the risk difference was below the pre-defined non-inferiority 
margin of 2.8%; the p-value for the test for non-inferiority was <0.0001. The null hypothesis of 
inferiority of DE versus warfarin could be rejected based on the evaluation of the risk difference. Thus, it

could be demonstrated based on both the hazard ratio and risk difference that DE was non-inferior to W. 
Table 11.4.1.1.1: 3 summarizes the results.  
Since non-inferiority of DE versus warfarin was demonstrated for both hazard ratio and risk difference, 
superiority was investigated. Superiority of DE over warfarin for the primary endpoint could not be 
demonstrated. The KM curves for the primary endpoint together with the number of patients at risk are 
shown in Figure 11.4.1.1.1: 1. 
Ancillary analyses 
Primary endpoint using pooled cohorts 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint was analysed after pooling all 3 cohorts. The analysis was 
performed using the same censoring principles and the same patient set ('FAS as randomised') as for the 
Assessment report

Page 51/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
primary endpoint. The hazard ratio between DE and warfarin was estimated overall, with treatment, 
cohort, and baseline stratification factors (cancer at baseline and symptomatic PE) as factors in the Cox 
regression model. The hazard ratio of DE versus warfarin for the primary endpoint using pooled cohorts 
was 1.47 (95% CI 0.80, 2.68), see Table 11.4.1.1.2: 1. Both the point estimate and the confidence 
interval were similar to the results of the primary analysis. 
The risk difference between DE and warfarin was first to be estimated for each stratum separately. 
Because of the low number of events, not all strata were evaluable separately. The stratification variable 
'active cancer at baseline' would have resulted in strata without events. Therefore only the 2 strata from 
the stratification variable 'symptomatic PE as qualifying event' were considered in the analysis. The 
cumulative risk at 18 months was 1.74% in the DE group and 1.38% in the W group (Table 11.4.1.1.2: 
2). The risk difference between DE and W was 0.26% (95% CI -0.72, 1.23). The cumulative risks and risk 
differences by stratum were comparable with the results by stratum for the primary analysis, again with 
the confidence interval in both strata including 0.0. 
Primary endpoint by stratification factor (active cancer at baseline, initial symptomatic PE) 
The primary endpoint was also assessed by stratification factor and stratum. As expected, the proportion 
of patients with a primary VTE event was higher for patients with initial symptomatic PE than for patients 
without PE. The hazard ratios for the primary endpoint were 2.10 (95% CI 0.85, 5.20) in patients with 
initial symptomatic PE and 1.07 (95% CI 0.47, 2.43) in patients without PE. The hazard ratios for the 
primary endpoint were 1.91 (95% CI 0.17, 21.06) in patients with cancer and 1.42 (95% 0.76, 2.64) in 
patients without cancer at baseline (Table 11.4.1.1.2: 3). For all 4 strata, the 95% confidence intervals 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 52/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
for the hazard ratios included 1, indicating that the observed numerical differences between treatment 
groups were not statistically significant. 
The cumulative risk for the primary endpoint was higher for patients with initial symptomatic PE (DE: 
2.9%, W: 1.4%) than for patients without PE (1.3% vs. 1.2%). Patients with active cancer at baseline 
had a higher cumulative risk for the primary endpoint (DE: 3.3%, W: 1.7%) than patients without active 
cancer at baseline (1.8% vs. 1.2%), which was also expected. Considering the 4 strata, the cumulative 
risks were highest in the stratum of patients with initial symptomatic PE and active cancer at baseline, 
and lowest in patients without PE and cancer, as expected (Table 11.4.1.1.2: 3). Within each stratum, 
there were numerical between-group differences in the numbers of patients with events and in the 
cumulative risks. 
Primary endpoint using unadjusted models 
An unadjusted analysis was performed based on pooled cohorts, using the same censoring principles and 
the same patient set ('FAS as randomised') as the primary analysis. The hazard ratio between DE and 
warfarin was estimated overall, using an unadjusted Cox regression model. In addition, the incidence 
density was calculated as the ratio of the number of patients with an event and the total time at risk. The 
resulting values between the treatment groups were compared between treatment groups and expressed 
as relative risk. The hazard ratio of DE versus warfarin for the primary endpoint using pooled cohorts and 
an unadjusted Cox model was 1.43 (95% CI 0.79, 2.62). Both the point estimate and the confidence 
interval were similar to the results of the primary analysis. The incidence density was 1.3 events per 100 
patient-years in the DE group and 0.91 events per 100 patient-years in the warfarin group. The relative 
risk for DE vs. warfarin was 1.43 (95% CI 0.79, 2.61). 
On-treatment analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 53/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The on-treatment analysis was performed using the 'FAS as treated' and using the same statistical 
methodology as for the pooled analysis. However, all patients were censored on the day following the day 
of last intake of study drug. Twenty patients in the DE group and 15 patients in the warfarin group had a 
primary outcome event while on-treatment. The on-treatment event was symptomatic DVT in 14 patients 
in the DE group and in 11 patients in the warfarin group; symptomatic PE in 7 and 4 patients, 
respectively, and VTE-related death (i.e. fatal PE) in 1 patient in the DE group. The on-treatment hazard 
ratio of DE versus warfarin for the primary endpoint was 1.35 (95% CI 0.69, 2.64), see Table 11.4.1.1.3: 
1. Both the point estimate and the confidence interval were similar to the results of the primary analysis. 
Note that the upper boundary of the confidence interval was below the non-inferiority margin defined for 
the primary analysis. Thus, the on-treatment analysis was consistent with the primary analysis. 
The cumulative risk at 18 months was 1.45% in the DE group and 1.24% in the warfarin group (Table 
11.4.1.1.3: 2). The risk difference between DE and warfarin was 0.14% (95% CI -0.81, 1.09) and 
therefore slightly smaller than in the primary analysis. 
Entire study period 
The primary analysis was repeated, considering all patient data collected during the entire study period 
(i.e. up to the date the patient was last contacted to check VTE status). Outcome events were not 
systematically collected after trial termination. However, all outcome events that were reported to the 
sponsor until the database was locked on 3 December 2010 were entered into the trial database. The 
number of patients with a primary outcome event up to the last contact date was 27 in the DE group and 
Assessment report

22 in the warfarin group. The primary outcome event was most commonly symptomatic DVT (18 vs. 14 
patients), followed by symptomatic, nonfatal PE (10 vs. 8 patients). The additional events after the 
planned treatment period were 1 DVT in each treatment group and 3 PEs in the warfarin treatment group. 
All 5 outcome events occurred shortly (4 days to 2 months) after the end of study treatment. All 5 
patients did not receive anticoagulant medication between the end of study treatment and the onset of 
the outcome event. The hazard ratio of DE vs. W was 1.24 (95% CI 0.71, 2.18). The upper limit of the 
confidence interval was below the non-inferiority margin defined for the primary analysis. The cumulative 
risk for the primary endpoint at 18 months was 1.73% in the DE group and 1.37% in the warfarin group. 
The risk difference between treatment groups was 0.25% (95% CI -0.71, 1.22).  
Per-protocol analysis 
The per-protocol analysis of the primary endpoint included all patients of the FAS who had no major 
efficacy-related protocol violation. The same statistical methods as for the pooled analyses were applied 
for the PPS analysis. The hazard ratio on DE vs. W was 1.42 (95% CI 0.77, 2.60). This was almost 
identical to the result of the primary analysis. The cumulative risks of the primary endpoint in the PPS at 
18 months were 1.70% and 1.41% in the DE and warfarin group. The risk difference was 0.16% (95% CI 
−0.81, 1.14). The results of the perprotocol analyses confirmed the robustness of the primary analysis for 
the hazard ratio and the risk difference. 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed to evaluate the consistency of the treatment 
effect across a variety of subgroups identified by demographic and baseline characteristics, and risk 
factors for recurrent VTE. The risk difference at 18 months was estimated using the KM estimate for the 
pooled cohorts and pooled strata within each subgroup. The hazard ratio was obtained from the Cox 
model including the subgroup-by-treatment interaction, without the stratification variables due to the 
small number of events. For all subgroups, the p-values for subgroup-by-treatment interactions were not 
statistically significant, indicating the lack of statistical evidence to demonstrate that the treatment 
difference varies across the subgroup categories. For all but 2 subgroups, the confidence intervals for risk 
differences included 0.0. These were the subgroup of BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (360 patients, RD: 3.11, 95%CI 
0.40, 5.81) and the subgroup of CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min (617 patients; RD: 2.04, 95%CI 0.40, 3.67). As 
the number of patients in these subgroups was relatively low and the p-values for subgroup-by-treatment 
interactions were close to 1 (BMI: 0.9969, CrCl: 0.9727), these observations were not considered of 
clinical relevance. In conclusion, because of the small event numbers and the lack of power, the results 
from the subgroup analyses cannot be considered to provide as robust information as the results from the 
primary efficacy analyses. Figure 11.4.1.1.6: 1 provides an overview of the analysis of the primary 
endpoint in key subgroups.

Comparison between central adjudication and local assessment 
All outcomes that contributed to the primary endpoint or secondary endpoints were to be adjudicated by 
the ICAC/VTE which was blinded to the treatment allocation of patients. To characterise the consistency 
of the endpoint classification, the data as recorded by the investigators on the CRF were compared with 
the events as classified by the ICAC/VTE. The rate of confirmation by the ICAC/VTE for locally suspected 
events (i.e. the percentage of events for which the adjudication result was the same as the local 
assessment) was 90.5% overall. For the different types of outcome events, the confirmation rates were 
similar to the overall rate (suspected recurrent DVT: 90.4%, suspected recurrent PE: 90.8%). The 
confirmation rates were similar between treatment groups. 
Of those locally suspected events that were also locally confirmed by objective clinical testing, the 
ICAC/VTE confirmed 63.6% of symptomatic DVTs, 77.8% of symptomatic PEs, and 67.7% of all primary 
outcome events. The proportion of locally confirmed events which were confirmed by central adjudication 
was slightly higher in the DE treatment group than in the warfarin group (78.8% vs. 55.1%). One patient 
(in the DE group) had a suspected recurrent DVT event that was locally confirmed by objective clinical 
testing but was considered as 'non-evaluable' by central adjudication. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints comprised an additional composite endpoint (recurrent symptomatic 
VTE and all deaths) and separate analyses of the components of the composite endpoints: symptomatic 
DVT, symptomatic PE (fatal and non-fatal), deaths related to VTE (i.e. fatal PE), and all deaths. Events 
were taken into account up to the end of the planned treatment period. The analyses of the secondary 
endpoints were based on all patients randomised and treated; patients were allocated to the treatment 
groups as randomised, regardless of the actual medication taken ('FAS as randomised'). All 3 cohorts 
were pooled for these analyses. For all secondary endpoints except the composite endpoint, strata were 
pooled for the risk difference analysis because of the low number of events.  
Composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and all deaths 
The number of patients who experienced recurrent symptomatic VTEs or died due to any reason was 42 
patients in the DE group and 36 patients in the warfarin group (Table 11.4.1.2.1: 1). For patients with 2 
centrally confirmed events that were components of the composite of recurrent VTE and all deaths, only 
Assessment report

the first event was used for the time-to-event analysis. The hazard ratio of DE vs. W for recurrent 
symptomatic VTE or death due to any reason was 1.18 (95% CI 0.75, 1.84). 
The cumulative risk for the composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and all deaths at 18 months was 
2.86% in the DE group and 2.53% in the warfarin group. The risk difference was 0.09% (95% CI -1.11, 
1.28), see Table 11.4.1.2.1: 2.  
The KM curves for the composite of recurrent VTE and all deaths together with the number of patients at 
risk are shown in Figure 11.4.1.2.1: 1. Events were observed throughout the treatment period, although 
events seemed to be more frequent between 18 and 24 months of treatment, as indicated by steeper 
slopes of the KM curves. In the first 9 months, the estimated cumulative risk was slightly higher in the DE 
group than in the warfarin group. Thereafter, the curves were almost overlapping, until they somewhat 
diverged again at around 18 months. Note that the number of patients at risk was relatively low after 18 
months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 58/146 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The cumulative risks for the composite of VTE and all deaths were highest for patients with initial 
symptomatic PE and active cancer at baseline (DE: 18.2%, W: 10.0%) and for patients with active cancer 
but without PE (11.4% vs. 9.1%). Patients with initial symptomatic PE without cancer at baseline had a 
lower risk for recurrent VTE and death (3.4% vs. 2.0%); patients with neither initial symptomatic PE nor 
cancer at baseline (1.8% vs. 2.3%) had the lowest risk. Note that the strata of patients with active 
cancer and with or without PE included a very low numbers of patients. None of the confidence intervals 
for the risk differences indicated a statistically significant between-treatment difference within any of the 
strata. 
Symptomatic DVT 
The number of patients with acute symptomatic DVT was 17 patients in the DE group and 13 patients in 
the warfarin group. The hazard ratio of DE vs. W for symptomatic DVT was 1.32 (95% CI 0.64, 2.71); 
see Table 11.4.1.2.2: 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 59/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
At 18 months, the number of patients with an acute symptomatic DVT was 15 in the DE group and 12 in 
the warfarin group. The cumulative risks were 1.17% and 0.98%, respectively. The resulting risk 
difference was 0.19% (95% CI -0.63, 1.00). A summary of the results is shown in Table 11.4.1.2.2: 2. 
Symptomatic PE 
The number of patients with a symptomatic, fatal or non-fatal PE was 10 in the DE group and 5 in the 
warfarin group. The hazard ratio of DE vs. W was 2.04 (95% CI 0.70, 5.98), as shown in Table 
11.4.1.2.3: 1. 
At 18 months, the cumulative risks for symptomatic PE were 0.66% in the DE group and 0.40% in the 
warfarin group (Table 11.4.1.2.3: 2). The risk difference was 0.26% (95% CI -0.32, 0.84). 
Deaths related to VTE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 60/146 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
One patient in the DE group and 1 patient in the warfarin group died from PE. The hazard ratio of DE vs. 
W for VTE-related death was 1.01 (95% CI 0.06, 16.22). The cumulative risks at 18 months were 0.08% 
and 0.07%, respectively, in the DE group and the warfarin group. The risk difference was 0.01% (95% CI 
-0.20, 0.23). 
All deaths 
The number of patients who died during the planned treatment period was comparable between the 
treatment groups (DE: 17 patients; W: 19 patients). The most frequent adjudicated cause of death was 
cancer for about half of the patients (DE: 7 patients, W: 9 patients). The hazard ratio of DE vs. W for all 
deaths was 0.90 (95% CI 0.47, 1.72). Details of the analysis are shown in Table 11.4.1.2.5: 1. 
The  cumulative  risks  for  death  at  18  months  were  1.22%  in  the  DE  group  and  1.24%  in  the  warfarin 
group; the resulting risk difference was -0.02% (95% CI -0.89, 0.84), see Table 11.4.1.2.5: 2. 
Prevention Study 1160.63 (RE-SONATE) 
Methods 
Study 1160.63 (RE-SONATE) evaluated the secondary prevention of recurrent VTE (sVTEp) and was a 
placebo-controlled study that enrolled patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT of the leg and/or 
acute symptomatic PE (treatment duration: 6 months), who had been treated for 6 to 18 months with an 
oral VKA or study drug in Study 1160.53. 
The study design and flowchart for the study is shown graphically below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 61/146 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Study participants 
Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with confirmed symptomatic PE or proximal DVT who had been treated for 6 
to 18 months with therapeutic dosages (intended INR between 2-3) of an oral VKA (e.g. W, 
acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, or fluindione) up to the moment of randomisation for the current study.  
After the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 30 May 2008) also patients completing the RE-
COVER study could be enrolled. 
Treatments 
The investigational product in this trial was DE 150 mg b.i.d. Placebo was the control treatment. 
When the required number of centrally confirmed recurrent symptomatic VTE events was reached (i.e. at 
least 36 events), as pre-specified, the trial close-out process was initiated, including termination of 
patient recruitment. Patients who had not completed the 3-month visit at trial close-out (on 30 
September 2010) ended treatment at the 3-month visit. All other patients were to continue double-blind 
treatment for the intended (planned) treatment period of 6 months. All patients, including those 
randomised but not treated, were to be followed up for the intended treatment period. There was to be a 
follow-up visit 30 days later for all patients. With the introduction of Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 30 
May 2008) the follow-up period was extended to 12 months for all patients. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate whether DE was superior to placebo in the long-term 
prevention of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with symptomatic deep 
Assessment report

vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) who had completed 6 to 18 months of treatment with 
a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was symptomatic recurrent VTE, defined as the composite of symptomatic 
DVT, non-fatal and fatal PE during the intended treatment period. Deaths that were unexplained were 
considered as fatal PEs for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint was analysed in 
terms of the time to first occurrence. Secondary efficacy endpoints were:  
• 
• 
The composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE, and fatal 
PE). Unexplained deaths were not included in this endpoint. 
The individual components of the primary efficacy endpoint: 
o  Symptomatic DVT 
o  Symptomatic PE 
o  Unexplained death 
Statistical methods and sample size 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed in terms of the time to first occurrence using a Cox 
proportional hazards model including the main effect of treatment. The DE-to-placebo hazard ratio (HR) 
and its corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Superiority of the DE group 
over placebo was to be concluded if the upper 95% confidence limit of the HR was less than 1. Kaplan-
Meier plots stratified by treatment were produced for efficacy endpoints that occurred during the intended 
treatment period. Patients who did not experience an event were censored. The log-rank test was 
performed as a sensitivity analysis. The composite endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE without 
unexplained death was analysed as described for the primary efficacy analysis. The frequencies of the 
individual components contributing to the primary efficacy endpoint were summarised by treatment 
group, 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper- Pearson method, and Fisher’s exact test was used to 
compare the 2 treatment groups. The cumulative incidence of recurrent symptomatic VTE events (with 
and without unexplained deaths) from randomisation up to the end of the 12-month extended follow-up 
period, after the intended treatment period, was determined. Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by treatment 
were produced, and log rank p-values and HRs were determined. Also, risk differences for recurrent 
symptomatic VTE events were estimated at 180, 220, 365, and 540 days after randomisation. Kaplan-
Meier curves, log rank p-value, and HR were also determined for recurrent symptomatic VTEs including 
unexplained death and including use of non-study anticoagulant medication during follow-up as an event. 
Assuming a 70% risk reduction in the DE group compared to the placebo group, a total of 36 events 
would give a power of 95% to demonstrate that DE was superior to placebo (two-sided type I error = 
0.05). Assuming a 3% frequency for the placebo group, approximately 900 patients per group were 
needed. 
Randomisation 
Each eligible patient was randomly assigned to either fixed dose (150 mg b.i.d.) DE or to placebo. 
Assignment of study treatment was via an IVRS with an allocation ratio of 1:1 for DE : placebo. 
Randomisation was stratified by centre using permuted blocks (block size: 4) to prevent a series of 
imbalanced treatment allocations. Randomisation was to take place 6 to 18 months after the index PE or

DVT event. All patients were to continue treatment with an oral VKA or RE-COVER study medication up to 
randomisation (or until screening, after Protocol Amendment 2 dated 30 May 2008 was implemented). 
Patients could only be randomised if their INR was ≤2.3. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study employed a double-blind design; neither the patient nor the investigator was informed about 
the allocated treatment. To ensure appropriate blinding, an IVRS was used for the assignment of patients 
to treatment groups. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The patient flow is shown in table below. 
Recruitment 
The recruitment period was December 2007 to December 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 7 global amendments to the trial protocol for Study 1160.63. 
The main purpose of Protocol Amendment 1 was to contraindicate the concomitant administration of 
quinidine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 64/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Amendment 2 introduced an extension of the follow-up period and eligibility criteria for roll-over patients 
from 1160.53. 
Amendment 3 updated the information regarding the management of patients requiring surgery.  
Amendment 4 updated the guidance concerning the concomitant use of verapamil and Amendment 6 
about the administration of ketoconazole and rifampicin and Amendment 7 about concomitant 
administration of other P-gp inducers (carbamazepine and St. Johns Wort).  
Amendment 5 introduced changes to administrative aspects of the trial.   
Local amendments in Germany 
In Local Protocol Amendment 1 in Germany (dated 24 October 2007), for safety reasons, an exclusion 
criterion was added to exclude patients with a contraindication to systemic anticoagulation. Local Protocol 
Amendment 2 in Germany (dated 26 June 2008) was introduced to amend the exclusion criteria 
regarding excessive risk of bleeding (because of anticipated need for quinidine), to allow previous study 
medication from the RE-COVER trial to have been used, and to exclude patients with active cancer. These 
changes were to ensure the protocol was consistent with the changes introduced with the global clinical 
trial Protocol Amendments 1 (11 February 2008) and 2 (30 May 2008). 
Local amendment in Sweden 
In Local Protocol Amendment 1 in Sweden (dated 15 October 2007), exclusion criterion 11 was amended 
because combined systemic hormonal contraceptives were contraindicated in Sweden for women with a 
history of venous thromboembolism. Combined oral contraceptives were added to the list of restricted 
concomitant medications. The concomitant use of gestagen-only systemic hormonal contraception 
required a risk benefit assessment by the investigator. 
Only Protocol Amendment 2 had an impact on the statistical analysis of the trial. This amendment, dated 
30 May 2008, was implemented for the following reasons:  
• 
• 
To determine whether or not there was an increase in VTE recurrence following discontinuation of 
study treatment by inclusion of a long term, open label follow-up period 
To clarify patients eligibility if bridging therapy was given during the previous 6 to 18 months of oral 
VKA therapy 
•  Clarification of timing of initiation of study medication relative to last dose of VKA 
• 
• 
To allow inclusion of patients after participation in RE-COVER (Study 1160.53) 
Exclusion of patients with known active cancer 
•  Reducing scheduled LFT monitoring frequency, which was done following a DSMB recommendation. 
•  Correction of typographical errors 
The major changes from the amendment with an impact on the statistical analysis were the inclusion of 
the extended follow-up period and allowing patients to roll-over into RE-SONATE after participation in RE-
COVER (Study 1160.53). Due to inclusion of patients rolling over from RE-COVER, the randomisation was 
changed in the protocol to allow for stratification within centres of patients by participation in RECOVER. 
This resulted in a number of changes to the statistical analysis plan (please refer to study report for 
further details).

Outcomes and estimation 
The incidence of the events of the primary endpoint was 0.4% in the DE group compared with 5.6% in 
the placebo group.  
The HR for DE versus placebo was 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.25). Superiority was therefore demonstrated for 
DE versus placebo.

Secondary endpoints  
The composite endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE events without unexplained death was analysed in 
the same way as the primary endpoint. The incidences of recurrent symptomatic VTE excluding 
unexplained death were 0.4% in the DE group and 5.3% in the placebo group. The HR for time to first 
occurrence of an event for DE versus placebo was 0.08, (95% CI: 0.03, 0.27). Superiority was therefore 
demonstrated for DE versus placebo since the upper 95% confidence limit of the HR was less than 1. 
Since there were only 2 unexplained deaths (both in the placebo group), these findings were similar to 
the primary analysis of efficacy. 
Ancillary analyses 
Consistent with the incidence of the composite endpoint, the incidences of DVTs, non-fatal PEs, and 
unexplained deaths were all lower for the DE group than for the placebo group.

The per-protocol analysis of the primary endpoint was consistent with the primary analysis of efficacy.  
Symptomatic recurrent VTE and unexplained deaths stratified by participation in RE-COVER 
In total, 27 patients rolled over from the RE-COVER trial (DE: 15 patients; placebo: 12 patients). None of 
the patients in the DE group and 2 patients in the placebo group who continued into RE-SONATE from the 
RE-COVER trial had centrally confirmed VTE events during the intended treatment period. Of the 2 
placebo patients with events, 1 patient had been treated with DE during RE-COVER (No. 22954) and had 
the event on Day 72 and 1 patient (No. 22956) previously treated with warfarin had an event on Day 28 
of the RE-SONATE trial.  
Subgroup analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 71/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint in an exploratory manner based on the 
following baseline characteristics: previous participation in the RE-COVER study, age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
geographical region, type of qualifying VTE event, history of multiple VTEs, and CrCl at baseline. Some 
subgroups had very small numbers of patients with events and as such, interpretation of these analyses 
is limited. Incidences of symptomatic recurrent VTE and unexplained deaths, HRs, and 95% CIs are 
summarised by subgroup in Figure 11.4.1.1.5:1. DE was effective versus placebo in all age subgroups, in 
males and females, and regardless of whether the qualifying event was DVT, PE, or both DVT and PE. 
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed, introducing each of the baseline covariates 
as a main effect (previous participation in the RE-COVER study, age, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical 
region, type of qualifying VTE event, history of multiple VTEs, and CrCl at baseline) together with the 
main effect of treatment in separate Cox regression models:

Cumulative symptomatic recurrent VTE events according to duration of previous VKA therapy (0 to 
≤6; >6 to ≤12 months, and >12 months) was determined. Kaplan-Meier plots of time to the first 
centrally confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE event, including unexplained death, in the intended 
treatment period indicated no noteworthy difference in the cumulative occurrence, regardless of the 
duration of previous VKA treatment. 
Symptomatic recurrent VTE events in the extended follow-up period 
Kaplan-Meier plots of time to the first centrally confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE events, including 
unexplained death, in the entire study period indicated no marked rebound in VTE events after 
discontinuation of DE treatment. In the 3-day washout period immediately after discontinuation of study 
treatment, the incidence of VTE events was lower in the DE group (0.1%) than in the placebo group 
(1.5%). Thereafter, during follow-up, there was an increase in the number of events in the DE group, but 
the HR at the end of the entire study period measured 0.61 (95% CI 0.42, 0.88). Superiority was 
therefore demonstrated for DE versus placebo at the end of the extended follow-up period.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The scope of the application was to evaluate the effect of DE in the treatment of acute VTE (aVTEt) and 
secondary prevention of recurrent VTE (sVTEp). VTE was defined as a composite of DVT and PE.  
No  dedicated  dose-finding  study  was  performed  to  support  the  aVTEt  and  sVTEp  indications.  A  dose  of 
150 b.i.d. DE showed a promising benefit risk ratio in several dose finding trials for patients undergoing 
orthopaedic surgery and patients with NVAF. The similarity in the profile of this regimen to warfarin at the 
same  target  INR  in  another  patient  population  (SPAF)  supports  the  use  in  patients  with  VTE.  Subgroup 
analysis  of  efficacy  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  in  patients  with  VTE  did  not  reveal  any 
subgroup-by-treatment interactions. 
In  all  populations  studied  with  DE  150  mg  b.i.d,  plasma  levels  correlated  well  with  the  anticoagulant 
activity. Data from previous studies showed that doses of DE 50 mg bi.d. and DE 150 mg o.d. seemed to 
be  less  effective  than  warfarin  with  a  target  INR  of  2-3.  DE  300  mg  b.i.d.  resulted  in  more  bleeding 
events than the comparator in phase II trials in orthopedic surgery patients and patients with NVAF, and 
the  choice  of  DE  150  mg  b.i.d.  seemed  more  reasonable  from  a  safety  point  of  view.  An  exposure-
response  analysis  was  performed  in  patients  in  VTE  Study  1160.53,  which  demonstrated  that  up  to  a 
trough DE concentration of 159 ng/mL, the upper bound of the 95% CI DE major bleeding event rate was 
below  the  observed  major  bleeding  event  rate  on  warfarin  (2%).  For  most  subgroups  analysed  (age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, geographic region, creatinine clearance [CrCl] at baseline, active cancer at 
any time, and history of bleeding) the incidence of bleedings were similar to warfarin or less. 
In conclusion, the dose of DE 150 mg b.i.d. was chosen because a higher dose of 300 mg b.i.d. resulted 
in  increased  rates  of  bleeding  events  and  that  dose-finding  trials  found  the  dose  of  150  mg b.i.d.  to  be 
favourable  in  patients  undergoing  orthopaedic  surgery  and  NVAF.  Similarities  in  study  populations

suggested  that  the  dose  could  be  extrapolated  to  patients  with  VTE.  The  Applicant’s  rationale  for  dose 
selection was largely considered acceptable. However, a lower dose may be more appropriate for certain 
subpopulations  (elderly,  patients  with  moderate  renal,  patients  treated  with  P-gp  inhibitors).  The  MAH 
subsequently proposed a posology identical to that of the atrial fibrillation indication. i.e. recommendation 
of  a  reduced  dose  recommendations  (daily  dose of  220  mg taken  as  two  110  mg  capsules)  for  patients 
aged 80 years or above and for patients who receive concomitant verapamil, as well as recommendations 
to consider this dose for other subgroups.  
The  effect  of  DE  was  demonstrated  in  four  randomized,  double-blind  Phase  III  studies;  three  active 
controlled  (W)  and  one  placebo-controlled.  Two  of  the  studies  support  the  aVTEt  indication,  and  two  of 
the studies supported the sVTEp indication. Studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II) 
were W-controlled 6-month studies enrolling patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism. 
These aVTEt studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 were replicate studies. 
Study  1160.47  (RE-MEDY)  was  warfarin-controlled  and  had  a  treatment  duration  of  6-36  months.  It 
evaluated  the  secondary  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE  (sVTEp)  and  enrolled  adult  patients  with  acute 
symptomatic proximal DVT or PE who had received anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 12 months or who had 
completed participation in Study 1160.53 or 1160.46. 
Study  1160.63  (RE-SONATE)  was  placebo-controlled  and  had  a  treatment  duration  of  6  months.  It 
evaluated  the  secondary  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE  (sVTEp)  and  enrolled  patients  with  acute 
symptomatic  proximal  DVT  of  the  leg  and/or  acute  symptomatic  PE,  who  had  been  treated  for  6  to  18 
months with an oral VKA or study drug in Study 1160.53.  
Overall,  the  studies  were  well  designed  to  fulfill  their  objective  and  according  to  relevant  regulatory 
guidelines. The number of protocol amendments was quite high in the development programme, but this 
is  acceptable  when  considering  the  size  and  complexity  of  the  programme.  Some  of  the  amendments 
were a result of the decision to include patients completing the aVTEt studies into the sVTEp studies. 
The design of the individual studies is discussed further below. 
Studies supporting the aVTEt indication: 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II) 
The pivotal aVTEt studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II) were randomized, double-
blind,  parallel-group  studies  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  oral  DE  (150  mg  b.i.d.)  compared  to  warfarin 
(target INR 2.0-3.0) for 6 months of treatment of acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism following 
initial  treatment  (5-10  days)  with  a  parenteral  anticoagulant  approved  for  this  indication.  The  pivotal 
aVTEt studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 were replicate studies. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria overall reflected the patient population in which DE is intended to be 
used. The patients were randomized according to active cancer and symptomatic PE at baseline. Baseline 
characteristics,  medical  history  and  concomitant  medications  were  comparable  between  the  treatment 
groups.  Risk  factors  for  VTE  were  previous  VTE,  smoking,  immobilization,  estrogen  use  and 
surgery/trauma and were balanced between treatment groups.  
The  primary  endpoint  of  aVTEt  studies  (as  well  as  the  active-controlled  sVTEp  Study  1160.47)  was  the 
composite  of  recurrent  symptomatic  VTE  and  VTE-related  deaths  (excluding  unexplained  deaths,  i.e., 
deaths  which  could  not  be  attributed  to  a  documented  cause  and  for  which  PE/DVT  could  not  be  ruled 
out).  This  composite  endpoint  is  the  endpoint  recommended  for  a  non-inferiority  design  in  the  relevant 
EMA  guidelines  (Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  venous 
thromboembolic disease [CPMP/EWP/563/98] and Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products 
for  the  prophylaxis  of  venous  thromboembolic  risk  in  non-surgical  patients  [CPMP/EWP/6235/04]).  The 
Assessment report

choice  of  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  is  acceptable.  The  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  for  the 
primary endpoint for hazard ratio was 2.75 and for risk difference 3.6%. 
Studies supporting the sVTEp indication 
Two studies supported the sVTEp indication. One study (1160.47, RE-MEDY) was in patients at high risk 
of  recurrence.  The  other  study  (1160.63,  RE-SONATE)  included  patients  at  presumed  low  risk  of 
recurrence, hence justifying the placebo control arm. 
Study 1160.47 (RE-MEDY) 
Study  1160.47  (RE-MEDY)  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  active-
controlled,  multi-centre  study  to  assess  whether  DE  could  show  non-inferiority  to  warfarin  on  long-term 
prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism. It included patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT or 
PE who had received anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 12 months or who had completed participation in the 
aVTEt studies. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  overall  reflect  the  patient  population  in  which  DE  is  intended  to  be 
used. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered relevant, sufficient and appropriate. 
As  indicated  above,  the  primary  endpoint  was  the  composite  of  recurrent  symptomatic  VTE  and  VTE-
related  deaths  (excluding  unexplained  deaths).  The  choice  of  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  is 
acceptable. The pre-defined non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint for hazard ratio was 2.85 and 
for risk difference 2.80%. 
Study 1160.63 (RE-SONATE) 
Study  1160.63  (RE-SONATE)  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled,  multi-
centre  study  to  assess  whether  DE  was  superior  to warfarin  in  the  prevention  of  recurrent  symptomatic 
VTE.  It  included  patients who  had  had  a  PE  or  DVT,  for  which  the  patients  had  received  treatment  with 
oral  VKA  in  6-18  months  prior  to  enrolment  in  Study  1160.63.  The  patients  could  also  roll-over  from 
Study 1160.53 (RE-COVER), being re-randomised entering Study 1160.63. The planned treatment period 
was 180 days followed by a 30 day wash-out period (double-blind treatment). The follow-up period was 
11 months.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were different from those of the RE-MEDY study since patients were at 
low  risk of  recurrence.  This  justified  the  placebo-controlled  design.  In  light of the  objective of  the  study 
and in the context of the RE-MEDY study, the criteria are deemed acceptable. 
The primary endpoint, a composite of symptomatic DVT, non-fatal and fatal PE, was analysed using the 
Cox proportional hazards model. In contrast to the other three studies, unexplained deaths were defined 
as fatal PEs. The design and conduct of the study was acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Studies supporting the aVTEt indication: 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II) 
The  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  between  the  two  aVTEt  studies  and  also  across  the  two 
treatment arms in the respective studies.  
In Study 1160.53, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.70). The p-value 
for non-inferiority was <0.0001. The cumulative risk for the primary endpoint at 6 months was 2.4% in 
the DE group and 2.2% in the warfarin group. The RD was 0.4% (95% CI −0.7, 1.5). The upper limit of 
the CI of the risk difference was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 3.6%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 77/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In Study 1160.46, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.85). The p-value 
for non-inferiority was 0.0002. The cumulative risk for the primary endpoint at 6 months was 2.4% in the 
DE group and 2.2% in the warfarin group. The risk difference was 0.2% (95% CI -1.0, 1.3).  
Use  of  DE  in  the  treatment  of  VTE  was  non-inferior  to  warfarin  under  the  conditions  given,  i.e.  a  non-
inferiority margin (NIM) of 2.75 for the hazard ratio and 3.6% in risk difference. The upper limits of the 
95% confidence limits were never above the NIM of 2.75. However, patients treated with DE experienced 
consistently  more  events  than  patients  treated  with  warfarin  although  the  numbers  were  small  (excess 
VTEs  in  the  DE  group  of  0.2  events  per  100  person  years  in  Study  1160.53  and  0.6  events  per  100 
person years in Study 1160.46). 
The  mean  time  in  therapeutic  range  (TTR)  in  the  aVTEt  studies  were  58%,  and  the  median  TTR  was 
60.6%. This was a concern since higher levels can probably be achieved in several EU/EEA countries, and 
suboptimal  TTR  may  present  a  bias  disfavouring  W.  In  its  response  to  these  concerns,  the  Applicant 
provided  a  survey  of  TTR  data  from  a  real  world  setting  and  from  several  historical  VTE  studies.  It  is 
accepted that TTR data from a real world setting are scarce and that TTR results may vary considerably 
depending  on  indication  for  VKA  treatment  and  experience.  Generally,  the  TTR  in  the  VKA  group  of  the 
aVTEt  studies  for  DE  was  slightly  lower  than  in  the  corresponding  studies  for  other  new  oral 
anticoagulants. However, the mean TTR in the VTE studies for DE was in the same range as other recent 
VTE studies.  
The Applicant also presented the primary efficacy endpoint and one secondary efficacy endpoint (VTE and 
all  death)  by  five  approximately  equally  sized  groups  (quintiles)  of  patients  according  to  their  TTR: 
<40%,  40-<57%,  57-<67%,  67-<78%  and  ≥78%  (see  table  below).  There  was  no  clear  relationship 
between  TTR  range  and  the  two  efficacy  endpoints.  Somewhat  unexpected,  the  quintile  for  the  aVTEt 
studies with the highest number of events was the one with the best TTR.  In contrast, bleeding events 
quite clearly occurred more frequently in the quintile with the poorest TTR (please see safety section).

In summary, the analysis of the effect of TTR on the efficacy results for warfarin did not reveal any clear 
impact on efficacy.  
It  is  noteworthy  that  both  aVTEt  studies  (along  with  the  active-referenced  sVTEp  study  RE-MEDY 
discussed below) showed warfarin to be numerically superior to DE – although the preset non-inferiority 
criteria were met. 
The key secondary endpoint, recurrent symptomatic VTE and all-cause deaths, occurred at a similar rate 
in both the DE in warfarin group in the replicate studies 1160.53 and 1160.46. The HR of DE vs. warfarin 
was  1.04  (95%  CI  of  0.80,  1.37).  In  both  studies,  the  differences  in  the  cumulative  risks  and  risk

differences in patients with/without symptomatic PE and with/without cancer in the two treatment groups 
were not significantly different. The incidences among the treatment groups of the individual components 
of  the  composite  endpoint  (death,  symptomatic  PE  and  DVT)  were  similar,  with  death  as  the  most 
frequent event followed by DVT and PE. 
Univariate and multivariate subgroups analysis did not show any clinically relevant interactions regarding 
baseline characteristics variables. 
Studies supporting the sVTEp indication 
Study 1160.47 (RE-MEDY) 
The  two  treatment  arms  of  the  study  were  comparable  with  regard  to  demographic  profile  and  other 
baseline characteristics. The rate of non-compliance was low in both study arms.  
Slightly more patients in the DE treatment arm experienced events contributing to the primary endpoint 
(26) compared to the warfarin arm (18). However, overall the numbers were low. The upper limit of the 
confidence  interval  of  the  hazard  ratio  (1.44,  95%  CI  0.78-2.64)  was  below  the  pre-defined  non-
inferiority  margin  of  2.85  (p=0.0137  for  non-inferiority),  and  thus  non-inferiority  could  be  claimed.  The 
cumulative  risk  for  the  primary  endpoint  at  18  months  were  slightly  higher  in  the  DE  treatment  arm 
(1.74%) compared to the warfarin treatment arm (1.38%). 
The upper limit of the confidence interval of the risk difference (0.38, 95% CI -0.50-1.25) was below the 
pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 2.8% (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority), and thus non-inferiority could 
be claimed.  
The  time  in  therapeutic  range  (TTR)  was  low  (51.9%)  during  the  first  study  month  increasing  gradually 
during  the  study.  The  mean  TTR  was  61.5%  and  the  median  TTR  was  65.3%.  This  was  raised  as  a 
concern.  However,  the  above  discussion  on  the  Applicant’s  response  with  regard  to  TTR  for  the  aVTEt 
studies is also applicable to the RE-MEDY study.  
A number of sensitivity analyses, such as using pooled cohorts and per-protocol analysis, yielded results 
that were comparable to the primary analysis.  
All  subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  had  p-values  that  did  not  indicate  statistical  significance 
and thus the data indicate that the treatment does not vary across subgroups. In all subgroups but 2, the 
confidence  intervals  for  risk  differences  included  0.0.  These  were  the  subgroup  of  BMI  ≥35  kg/m2  (360 
patients,  RD:  3.11,  95%CI  0.40,  5.81)  and  the  subgroup  of  CrCl  50  to  80  mL/min  (617  patients;  RD: 
2.04,  95%CI  0.40,  3.67).  As  the  number  of  patients  in  these  subgroups  was  relatively  low  and  the  p-
values  for  subgroup-by-treatment  interactions  were  close  to  1  (BMI:  0.9969,  CrCl:  0.9727),  these 
observations were not considered of clinical relevance. In conclusion, because of the small event numbers 
and the lack of power, the results from the subgroup analyses cannot be considered to provide as robust 
information as the results from the primary efficacy analyses. This is regarded as acceptable. 
All three cohorts were pooled for the analyses of secondary endpoints. 42 patients (DE) compared to 36 
patients (W) experienced recurrent VTEs or died due to any reason. The hazard ratio of DE vs. warfarin 
was 1.18 (95% CI 0.75-1.84). The cumulative risk for the composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE and 
all deaths at 18 months was 2.86% in the DE group and 2.53% in the warfarin group. The risk difference 
was 0.09% (95% CI -1.11, 1.28). 
The  cumulative  risks  for  the  composite  of  VTE  and  all  deaths  were  highest  for  patients  with  initial 
symptomatic PE and active cancer at baseline (DE: 18.2%, W: 10.0%) and for patients with active cancer 
but without PE (11.4% vs. 9.1%). This is in accordance with expectations.

Comparable numbers of patients experienced DVT in the two treatment arms (DE: 17, W 13). The hazard 
ratio of DE vs. W was 1.32 (95% CI 0.64, 2.71). At 18 months, 15 patients (DE) vs. 12 patients (W) had 
experienced an acute symptomatic DVT. The cumulative risks were 1.17% and 0.98%, respectively. The 
resulting risk difference was 0.19% (95% CI -0.63, 1.00). 
More patients experienced symptomatic, fatal or non-fatal PE in the DE group (10) vs. in the W group (5). 
The hazard ratio of DE vs. warfarin was 2.04 (95% CI 0.70, 5.98). At 18 months, the cumulative risks for 
symptomatic  PE  were 0.66%  in the  DE  group  and 0.40% in  the  warfarin  group.  The  risk  difference  was 
0.26% (95% CI -0.32, 0.84). 
One  patient  in  each  group  died  from  PE.  The  hazard  ratio  of  DE  vs.  W  for  VTE-related  death  was  1.01 
(95%  CI  0.06,  16.22).  The  cumulative  risks  at  18  months  were  0.08%  (DE)  and  0.07%  (W).  The  risk 
difference  was  0.01%  (95%  CI  -0.20,  0.23).  A  comparable  number  of  deaths  of  all  causes  during  the 
planned treatment period were observed in the two groups (DE: 17, W: 19).  
Study 1160.63 (RE-SONATE) 
More  patients  receiving  placebo  (15%)  discontinued  the  study  compared  to  patients  receiving  DE 
(10.4%). Discontinuations were primarily due to adverse events (n=81 in the placebo group and n=50 in 
the DE group). Of these adverse events n=49 in the placebo group was symptomatic DVT or PE compared 
to n=4 in the DE treated group. DE treated patients experienced more bleedings (n=11) compared to the 
placebo group (n=4). Overall, 85-90% did no discontinue from study drug which is acceptable. The rate 
of non-compliance was low in both study arms.  
Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups. The frequencies of baseline 
conditions  were  reasonably  balanced  between  treatment  groups,  with  a  few  exceptions  that  are  not 
considered to impact the overall results.  
Superiority of DE over placebo for the secondary prevention of VTE (composite of recurrent DVT or fatal 
or  non-fatal  PE  and  unexplained  deaths)  was  shown  in  the  study.  The  DE  treated  group  experienced  3 
symptomatic  VTEs  compared  to  37  symptomatic  VTEs  in  the  6  month  treatment  period.  The  HR  for  DE 
versus placebo was 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.25). The analysis of the individual components of the primary 
composite  endpoint  showed  that  for  all  components  the  frequency  was  lower  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
per-protocol analysis of the primary endpoint was consistent with the primary analysis of efficacy. DE was 
effective  versus  placebo  in  all  age  subgroups,  in  males  and  females,  and  regardless  of  whether  the 
qualifying event was DVT, PE, or both DVT and PE. Age, sex and baseline CrCL adjusted Cox regression 
model did not alter the overall HR (HR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.024, 0.251) compared to the primary analysis. It 
appears that the effect of DE compared to placebo was sustained in the study-drug free 12 month follow-
up period with a HR of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.88) at the end of the entire study period. 
The results show that at least 25% of patients in the placebo group needed anticoagulant therapy at the 
end  of  the  study  treatment  period.  This  high  number  of  patients  is  quite  remarkable  for  a  placebo-
controlled study. This confirms that some patients included still were in need of anticoagulant therapy.

Uncertainties regarding the results 
During the assessment, the CHMP expressed a concern that up to about half of the effect of warfarin may 
be lost as evidenced by the results of the RE-MEDY study combined with the excess of ACS events and 
the fact that the advantage over warfarin in terms of bleedings appear to diminish in warfarin-treated 
patients who are managed reasonably well (i.e. disregarding patients with the poorest INR control). It 
was acknowledged by the CHMP that the efficacy looks more favourable in the acute treatment studies 
(RE-COVER and RE-COVER II). The CHMP considered that it would be highly problematic to grant a 
treatment indication without also granting a prevention indication. 
The Applicant further justified the positive benefit-risk balance of DE in both the acute treatment and the 
prevention indication. The Applicant explained that the three warfarin-controlled studies with DE in 
(acute) venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment (RE-COVER, RE-COVER II) and in secondary VTE 
prevention (RE-MEDY) clearly met the predefined non-inferiority (NI) margins with regard to recurrent 
VTE for both the hazard ratios (HRs) and risk differences (RDs), demonstrating consistent efficacy for 
both VTE treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE. In addition, a positive net clinical benefit was 
demonstrated with DE against warfarin, which was not driven by poor levels of INR control in the warfarin 
patients.  Finally, the placebo-controlled study with DE in long-term prevention of recurrent VTE (RE-
SONATE) unequivocally demonstrated the efficacy of DE in the VTE prevention setting. 
In clinical studies with very low incidences of efficacy endpoint events, as observed in the RE-MEDY 
study, the RD was considered statistically more appropriate than the HR to measure any difference in the 
effect size between the treatment groups. The RDs for the primary efficacy endpoint of recurrent VTE and 
VTE related deaths events in RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, and RE-MEDY were comparable at 0.4%, 0.2% 
and 0.4%, respectively. This clearly indicates that there is no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy 
between treatments for both (acute) VTE treatment and secondary VTE prevention. Retrospective 
calculations showed that the three warfarin-controlled trials independently demonstrated that more than 
85% of the warfarin effect was preserved, demonstrating comparability across trial results which is not as 
clearly observed when comparing HRs alone. The amount of preserved effect is in line with the literature, 
which recommends 50% preservation of the effect in terms of the confidence interval (classical 95-95 
rule) or 2/3 of the effect. 
In addition to comparable efficacy to warfarin, the incidence of all categories of major bleeding events 
(MBE) was lower for DE patients compared to warfarin for both studies of short (6 months in RE-
COVER/RE-COVER II) and longer duration (up to 36 months in RE-MEDY). Based on the study results, 
one would expect a reduction of 1.5 events less (MBE) in 100 patient-years of treatment with DE vs. 
warfarin in patients treated for (acute) VTE, and 0.6 events less (MBE) in 100 patient-years in patients 
treated for secondary VTE prevention.  To better represent clinical situations, adding clinically relevant 
bleeding events (CRBE) to MBE demonstrated a  reduction of 7.7 events less (MBE and CRBE) in 100 
patient-years of treatment with DE vs. warfarin in patients treated for (acute) VTE, and 3.8 events less 
(MBE and CRBE) in 100 patient-years in patients treated for secondary VTE prevention. These bleeding 
reductions were considered clinically meaningful.  
To put the rate of ACS events into a broader perspective, a composite net clinical benefit endpoint was 
applied. The composite endpoint of non-fatal recurrent VTE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal 
systemic embolism, all-cause death and MBE was very similar between DE and warfarin for both the 
pooled RE-COVER/RE-COVER II studies as well as for RE-MEDY, with HRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.81-1.27) 
and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.75-1.46), respectively. Furthermore, when both MBEs and clinically relevant non 
major bleeding events (CRBEs) were included into this analysis, a statistically significant benefit for DE 
over warfarin was shown for both the pooled RE-COVER/RE-COVER II studies as well as for RE-MEDY, 
with HRs of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.95) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59-0.91) respectively.

The benefit of warfarin is dependent on the patient’s time in therapeutic range (TTR). Hence, it was 
questioned whether the positive results in the DE trials were partly driven by poor control of INR in 
warfarin patients. The MAH therefore analysed the association of the clinical effect of dabigatran to the 
quality of warfarin control by using the centre TTR (cTTR), which is the mean TTR of all warfarin patients 
in each centre. In all these analyses for both the pooled RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY studies, it 
was shown that there was no clear dependency between the clinical efficacy, clinical safety and the net 
clinical benefit results of DE to the centre TTR.  This demonstrated that the positive results of DE in the 
VTE programme were not driven by the poor levels of INR control in the warfarin patients.  
Consistency of overall efficacy results 
The objective of all three warfarin-controlled trials with DE (RE-COVER, RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY) was 
to show non-inferiority to warfarin in both hazard ratio (HR) and risk difference (RD). For the (acute) VTE 
treatment studies, RE-COVER and RE-COVER II, based on data from previous published studies in this 
therapy area, an NI margin of 2.75 in HR and 3.6% in RD was selected, corresponding to preservation of 
at least 57% and 75% of the effect of full-dose W, respectively. The individual studies, RE-COVER and 
RE-COVER II, showed comparable HRs, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.70) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.85) 
respectively, demonstrating consistent efficacy of DE in two independent studies during the first six 
months of therapy after an index VTE event. The primary endpoint results of both trials, RE-COVER and 
RE-COVER II, with regard to the upper limit of the 95% CI of the HR (1.70 and 1.85, respectively) were 
well below the pre-specified NI margin of 2.75 and it is important to note that these results were also 
below the more restrictive margin of non-inferiority of  2.0, used in the pivotal trials for rivaroxaban, 
EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE.  The RDs for both the studies were consistent, and were also well below 
the pre-specified NI margin of 3.6%. The RDs was 0.4% (95% CI, -0.7 to 1.5) for the RE-COVER study 
and 0.2% (95% CI, -1.0 to 1.3) for the RE-COVER II study. The results of the HRs and RDs from RE-
COVER and RE-COVER II studies indicate a clear relationship between HR and RD.   
For the secondary VTE prevention study RE-MEDY, an NI margin of 2.85 in HR and 2.8% in RD was 
selected, corresponding to preservation of at least 70% and 67% of the effect of full-dose W, 
respectively. These pre-specified criteria for declaring non-inferiority for the HR and RD were met in the 
RE-MEDY study: HR 1.44 (95% CI: 0.78, 2.64) and RD 0.4% (95% CI: -0.5, 1.2). Even though the HR 
was above 1 in RE-MEDY, the effect of low event rates on the HR can be seen, as the between-group RD 
was still small  and similar to the rate seen in the RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies. Having a relatively 
large HR (upper limit 95% CI was 2.64) while having a small RD of 0.4% can be explained by the very 
low rate of recurrent VTEs and VTE-related deaths in this study (22 VTE events (1.7%) in the DE group, 
17 VTE events(1.4%) in the warfarin group). As a result, each incremental event had a significant impact 
on the HR, but the event rates and RD remained low and indicate that both DE and warfarin are effective.  
Based on the yearly event rates calculation, one would expect an excess of 0.4 events (VTE and VTE-
related deaths) per 100 patient-years of treatment with DE vs. warfarin in patients treated for secondary 
VTE prevention, and also 0.4 events (VTE and VTE-related deaths) per 100 patient-years of treatment 
with DE vs. warfarin in patients treated for (acute) VTE. This shows the consistency of results between 
the three warfarin-controlled studies indicating that there is no clinically meaningful difference between 
the effect of DE in the treatments for both (acute) VTE treatment and secondary VTE prevention. 
From further analyses of the different components of the primary efficacy endpoint one can expect an 
excess of 0.35 events (symptomatic DVT) and 0.07 events (fatal and non-fatal PE) per 100 patient-years 
of treatment with DE vs. warfarin patients treated for (acute) VTE. For patients treated for secondary VTE 
prevention one can expect an excess of 0.15 events (symptomatic DVT) and 0.25 events (fatal and non-
fatal PE) per 100 patient-years of treatment with DE vs. warfarin. This again shows the consistency of

results between studies, and confirms that risk differences for more severe events (PE events) are very 
small in both the (acute) VTE and secondary VTE prevention studies. 
In addition, the clinical efficacy of DE in the secondary VTE prevention indication is further supported by 
the results from the RE-SONATE study. In the RE-SONATE study, which was a placebo-controlled, 
secondary VTE prevention study, DE was clearly shown to be superior than placebo in terms of the 
primary endpoint (VTE, VTE-related and unexplained deaths) with a HR of 0.08 (95% CI , 0.02 to 0.25; 
p<0.001). This result is comparable to the primary efficacy endpoint result from the EINSTEIN-Extension 
study. (HR 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39). 
Efficacy results and association with warfarin INR control 
The benefit of warfarin is dependent on the quality of the INR control and this can be deduced from the 
patient’s time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR between 2.0 and 3.0). It was questioned whether the 
positive results in the DE trials were partly driven by the poor control of the INR in the warfarin patients. 
Therefore an analysis on the association of the clinical effect of DE to the quality of the INR control in the 
warfarin patients was performed. For this analysis, the quality of the INR control is represented by the 
centre TTR (cTTR), which is the mean TTR of all the individual warfarin patients in each centre. Centers 
were then divided into five groups (quintiles) according to their mean TTR values. DE patients were 
assigned to the five groups based on the assignment of their individual center. The quintiles were 
determined for the pooled RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY studies separately.  
The analysis of the primary clinical efficacy endpoint according to the cTTR, for both the RE-COVER/RE-
COVER II and the RE-MEDY studies showed no obvious clear pattern between the clinical efficacy and 
cTTR quintiles, therefore confirming that the clinical efficacy effect of DE does not diminish when 
compared to warfarin-treated patients who are managed reasonably well. 
Clinical benefit of overall safety results 
In addition to comparable efficacy to warfarin, the incidence of all categories of MBEs (consisting of MBEs, 
adjudicated MBEs with a fatal outcome, TIMI major bleeding, and intracranial MBEs) as well as life-
threatening bleeding events, MBEs and CRBEs, and any bleeding events (MBEs, CRBEs, and 
nuisance/trivial bleeding) were lower for DE patients compared to warfarin for both studies of short (6 
months in RE-COVER/RE-COVER II) and longer duration (up to 36 months in RE-MEDY). Based on the 
study results one would expect a reduction of 1.5 events less (MBE) per 100 patient-years of treatment 
with DE vs. warfarin in patients treated for (acute) VTE, and 0.6 events less (MBE) per 100 patient-years 
in patients treated for secondary VTE prevention, and a reduction of 7.7 events less (MBE and CRBE) per 
100 patient-years of treatment with DE vs. warfarin in patients treated for (acute) VTE, and 3.8 events 
less (MBE and CRBE) per 100 patient-years in patients treated for secondary VTE prevention. These 
bleeding reductions were considered clinically meaningful. 
Further analyses were conducted to ascertain the effect of cTTR on the bleeding results (MBE, MBE and 
CRBE). For both the RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and the RE-MEDY studies no obvious clear pattern could 
according to the Applicant be observed between the bleeding risk and cTTR quintiles, therefore showing 
that the advantage over warfarin in terms of bleeding does not appear to diminish when compared to 
warfarin-treated patients who are managed reasonably well.  
Net clinical benefit in RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY 
The benefit-risk balance of DE compared to warfarin in both the (acute) VTE treatment and the secondary 
VTE prevention indications was further explored by evaluating the net clinical benefit. This was evaluated 
using two approaches. The first more conservative approach to this composite endpoint includes non-fatal 
Assessment report

Page 87/146 
  
  
 
 
 
recurrent VTE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal systemic embolism, all-cause death, and MBE. 
With the second approach, MBE and CRBE are also included, which gives a comprehensive analysis 
applicable to real-world clinical practice situations.   
The first composite net clinical benefit endpoint (non-fatal recurrent VTE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
non-fatal systemic embolism, all-cause death, MBE) calculated for the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER 
II studies is shown in table 1.4.1.1.1.1 below (please note that in the tables, the composite net clinical 
benefit endpoint is presented as “composite cardiovascular endpoint”). With a HR close to 1, the net 
clinical benefit is similar for DE and warfarin treatment (HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.81-1.27)). However, when 
MBEs and CRBEs were included in the calculation of the net clinical benefit (endpoint non-fatal recurrent 
VTE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal systemic embolism, all-cause death, MBE/CRBE), a 
statistically significant difference was evident favouring DE over warfarin (HR 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.95)) 
(Table 1.4.1.2.1.1 below).
The analyses performed for the RE-COVER studies were also applied to the RE-MEDY study. As with the 
pooled RE-COVER/RE-COVER II studies, the first composite net clinical benefit endpoint analysis showed 
similar net clinical benefit between DE and warfarin, with a HR close to 1 (HR 1.05 (95% CI: 0.75-1.46)). 
However, in the second composite net clinical benefit endpoint analysis where MBEs and CRBEs were 
included, a statistically significant difference was again evident favouring DE over warfarin (HR 0.73 (95% 
CI: 0.59-0.91)). (Tables 1.4.1.1.1.4 and 1.4.1.2.1.4 below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 88/146 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The results of the net clinical benefit analyses therefore shows that overall, when compared to warfarin, 
DE has a positive impact to the clinical outcome of the patients treated for acute VTE and also for 
secondary VTE prevention. 
Net Clinical Benefit stratified by cTTR: 
For the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies, in both the net clinical benefit endpoint analyses, no 
clear pattern was according to the Applicant obvious between cTTR quintiles and the net clinical benefit, 
indicating that the positive benefit of DE over warfarin is not dependant on the quality of the INR control 
in the warfarin patients. 
For the RE-MEDY study, the results again showed no clear pattern. For the net clinical benefit including 
MBEs and CRBEs, it is worth noting that for all the cTTR quintiles, all the HRs are below 1, numerically 
favouring DE over warfarin.  
According to the Applicant, the results of the net clinical benefit analyses according to cTTR therefore 
showed that overall, when compared to warfarin, the positive impact of DE to the clinical outcome of the 
patients treated for acute VTE and also for secondary VTE prevention, is not dependant to the quality of 
INR control in the warfarin treated patients. 
The MAH concluded that the three active-controlled studies with DE, two of which in (acute) VTE 
treatment (RE-COVER, RE-COVER II) and the third in secondary VTE prevention (RE-MEDY) robustly 
demonstrated therapeutic equivalence compared to warfarin. No clear dependency between clinical 
efficacy, clinical safety and net clinical benefit and the cTTR levels was detected demonstrating that the 
positive results were not driven by the poorly controlled warfarin patients. Furthermore, DE in the long-
term prevention of recurrent VTE (RE-SONATE) was unequivocally superior to placebo in terms of clinical 
efficacy. According to the MAH, the totality of the data demonstrates that DE is safe and efficacious and 
can serve as a valuable alternative to warfarin for both the (acute) treatment of VTE and secondary VTE 
prevention. 
The CHMP largely agreed with the response of the Applicant. The Applicant argued that because of the 
low number of events in the RE-MEDY study, the risk difference  was a more appropriate calculation. The 
CHMP agreed that the absolute difference between DE and warfarin in the RE-MEDY study was small. 
Looking at the results of the RE-MEDY study in the perspective of the aVTEt studies and the lack of a 
plausible explanation as to why the efficacy of DE compared to warfarin would be less in the prevention 
setting than in the acute setting as well as the convincing placebo-controlled prevention study (RE-
SONATE), the CHMP considered that the efficacy also for the prevention indication was acceptable – also 
in light of the advantages in terms of bleedings. While the CHMP did consider that poorly managed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 89/146 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
patients on warfarin had more major bleedings than other warfarin patients, it was agreed that the 
advantage of DE in terms of major bleeding events was also evident when comparing to warfarin-treated 
patients in other TTR categories, including patients with TTR levels similar to those typically seen in 
Europe. 
Correlation between DE exposure and clinical events in VTE patients  
In addition the CHMP expressed the opinion that no assessment of efficacy results related to exposure 
was performed in RE-COVER due to the low number of ischaemic events. The Applicant was asked to 
further assess the correlation between DE exposure in VTE patients and clinical events in order to be able 
to define the target range of PK values where it is necessary to perform drug monitoring (in a bleeding or 
emergency setting for example).  
The Applicant provided a response were it was argued that in VTE patients, due to the low number of 
endpoint  events and the availability of PK only in the RE-COVER study (N = 850 patients had PK at visit 
4), a limited exposure-response analysis (only on MBE, no sub-group analyses [U12-3388]) could be 
done. Although the correlation was weaker (especially at higher concentrations) in RE-COVER than in the 
more robust RE-LY analysis these data confirm consistency in the exposure-bleeding relationship across 
VTE and NVAF (non-valvular atrial fibrillation) patients. Additionally, a high consistency could be observed 
between RE-LY and RE-COVER patients when comparing dabigatran trough plasma concentrations from 
patients stratified by age, renal function or verapamil co-medication. The clinical phase III study in NVAF 
patients, RE-LY, is considered to have a robust and more informative data set in terms of exposure-
response. A trough concentration exceeding 200 ng/mL, which is exceeding the 90th percentile in RE-LY, 
may be associated with a presumably increased risk of bleeding also for VTE patients if the comorbidities 
and co-medications influencing bleeding risk are also similar. The Applicant clarified that the available 
information is reflected in the current SmPC for the approved indications. The SmPC was proposed to be 
changed to reflect this information for both indications, SPAF and DVT/PE treatment and secondary 
prevention. Assessment of dabigatran plasma concentrations may be helpful to avoid excessive high 
exposure to dabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors for bleeding. The Applicant pointed out, 
that this information is included the SmPC, section 4.4 and will also apply to DVT/PE patients: 
Pradaxa does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring. However, the measurement of 
dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to avoid excessive high exposure to dabigatran in the 
presence of additional risk factors. The INR test is unreliable in patients on Pradaxa and false positive INR 
elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. Diluted thrombin time 
(dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may provide useful 
information, but the tests are not standardised, and results should be interpreted with caution (see 
section 5.1).  
This information is further detailed in the DVT/PE prescriber guide.  
In general, DE does not qualify for a narrow therapeutic index drug (NTI) according to the commonly 
accepted definitions (see also Am J Health Syst Pharm 1997; 54: 1630-2 [R09-6026]). According to the 
Applicant, DE has been proven to be safe and efficacious in several fixed dose clinical trials in orthopaedic 
surgery (OS) patients, patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and patients with DVT/PE (VTE) 
and results of all clinical studies with dabigatran across indications, so far, do not point to the need of 
regular therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and dosing guided by TDM. In terms of safety (major bleeding 
events, MBE) in VTE patients fixed dose dabigatran was shown to have even less MBEs than INR 
controlled warfarin. The Applicant was thus, of the opinion that the submitted label contains sufficient 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 90/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
information including quantitative information on dabigatran concentrations and PD to safeguard the 
therapy with DE. The Applicant concluded that although the determination of the anticoagulation activity 
may be helpful in some situations (in a bleeding or emergency setting for example), DE does not qualify 
for a drug which requires regular drug monitoring as has been consistently shown in multiple trials across 
indications in comparison to INR monitored warfarin. The need for drug monitoring is further limited by 
the fact that the current label would allow dose adjustment due to patient characteristics such as age and 
renal function, further mitigating the risk of excessive anticoagulation and bleeding. With respect to any 
definition of a “target therapeutic range” even the multitude of clinical data in RE-LY did not allow for 
clearly defined boundaries, making any chosen value questionable. It is, thus, not expected that any 
further clinical trial in the VTE indication would allow for a more precise estimation of a presumed 
“therapeutic range”. In terms of bleeding, the Applicant considered it reasonable to communicate the 
dabigatran plasma concentrations which may be indicative of dabigatran-induced bleeding in case of an 
emergency. As the pathophysiology for bleeding is regarded as not different between the two patient 
populations of VTE and NVAF patients, the levels already reported in the current SmPC (see Table 2 from 
the section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions) are overall applicable. It is, thus not expected that any 
further study would provide substantial new information to change the current information based on the 
data from RE-LY in over 18,000 patients and confirmed by the data from RE-COVER. 
The CHMP agreed in general with the conclusions provided by the Applicant. Due to the low number of 
endpoint events in VTE patients and the availability of PK only in the RE-COVER study (N = 850 patients 
had PK at visit 4), a limited exposure-response analysis, could be done showing only a dose-response 
relationship for MBE. It is acknowledged that the PK data from the RELY study are more robust, due to 
the higher number of included patients in this study. However, this does not preclude, in the future, 
further PK analyses in smaller studies, in order to collect information from different clinical settings for 
example, and thus be able to check the consistency of results between studies or no, since it is an 
important issue with this product. The consistency between RE-COVER and RE-LY was demonstrated as 
assessed by the CHMP. Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the proposition of the MAH to extend the current 
information provided in the SmPC for SPAF indication to DVT/PE indication: trough concentration > 200 
ng/ml associated with a presumably increased risk of bleeding.  
The Applicant assumed that only plasma concentrations which may be indicative of dabigatran-induced 
bleeding are of value, in case of an emergency for instance. The CHMP considered however that the 
detection of low plasma concentrations which may indicate insufficient efficacy (and therefore correlated 
with increased risk ischemic events) are also of value. Such values could be useful indeed, when 
dabigatran has to be temporarily discontinued, before surgery for instance, in order to check that patients 
are not under-anticoagulated and may need a switch to parenteral anticoagulation. Therefore, it was 
recommended that the Applicant should continue to perform PK analyses in the ongoing and upcoming 
clinical trials to check the consistency of the results between studies on the correlation of PK data to MBE 
events and ischaemic events and provide the results of these analyses within the upcoming PSURs.  
An important concern pertained to the dose recommendations originally proposed by the Applicant. Based 
on the four pivotal studies forming the basis of the DVT/PE application, the Applicant initially 
recommended no posology changes based on an age criteria or in the event of concomitant treatment 
with P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil. While it may be argued that the SPAF population represents a 
more frail subgroup as compared to the DVT/PE population, posology changes and dose reduction of DE 
based on an age criterion such as over 80 years might be considered relevant. Similarly, the CHMP 
assumed that P-gp inhibition with verapamil might in general affect patients equally, irrespective of the 
presence of a diagnosis of SPAF or DVT/PE.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 91/146 
  
  
 
 
 
Thus, even in the DVT/PE population, a different posology recommendation in these subgroups was 
considered relevant. In contrast, the possible consequence of suboptimal treatment might be perceived 
as being greater in the SPAF population as compared with the DVT/PE population. Accordingly, a greater 
risk of bleeds may be accepted in the SPAF population to achieve optimal anticoagulation. Nevertheless, it 
is within this (SPAF) indication that reduced dosing regimens of DE are recommended.   
Finally, following the discussion, the Applicant subsequently accepted a posology identical to that of the 
SPAF indication. i.e. recommendation of a reduced dose recommendations (daily dose of 220 mg taken as 
two 110 mg capsules) for patients aged 80 years or above and for patients who receive concomitant 
verapamil, as well as recommendations to consider this dose for other subgroups. It should noted that 
this lower dose was not tested in the aVTEt and sVTEp programme, and the low number of patients in 
these subgroups in the completed studies with 150 mg BID did not allow firm conclusions based on 
clinical outcomes. However, pharmacokinetic data indicated that alignment with the posology for the 
SPAF indication was the most appropriate solution, and it was supported by the CHMP. 
The percentage of patients with cancer enrolled in warfarin-controlled trials was 4.5% for the pooled RE-
COVER trials and 4.2% for RE-MEDY. In all the warfarin-controlled trials, active cancer was defined as a 
diagnosis of cancer, other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, within five years before 
the enrolment, any treatment for cancer within five years or recurrent or metastatic cancer. 
The results show that there was a significantly higher frequency of recurrent VTE or VTE-related mortality 
among patients who had cancer compared to patients who did not have cancer, independently of the 
anticoagulation treatment received. Amongst the cancer patients, the efficacy of DE was not different 
from W. In terms of safety, the incidence of bleeding events in cancer patients treated with dabigatran 
was comparable to those treated with W. 
Given the limitations of the small samples sizes of patients with cancer enrolled in the VTE programme 
with DE and the heterogeneity of cancer, the Applicant acknowledged that it is adequate to include the 
warning in the SmPC section 4.4 for Pradaxa 110 mg and 150 mg that the efficacy and safety have not 
been established for DVT/PE patients with active cancer. 
During the assessment the CHMP suggested that the current algorithm in section 4.2 of the SmPC for 
switching from DE to VKA could be revised as a patient could receive VKA for 5 days without monitoring 
which may be too long, especially in the case of acenocoumarol. 
The MAH explained that the current SmPC wording was driven by the fact that INR testing to assess 
anticoagulation status when taking DE is unreliable and in some patients false positive INR elevations 
have been reported. Hence, even a declining, residual effect of dabigatran may still elevate the INR level 
during the switching period. The Applicant agreed with the comment that the current wording (Because 
Pradaxa can contribute to an elevated INR, INR testing should not be performed until Pradaxa has been 
stopped for at least 2 days) should be revised.  
At the end it was agreed to modify the wording as follows:  
Because Pradaxa can increase INR, the INR will better reflect VKA’s effect only after Pradaxa has been 
stopped for at least 2 days. Therefore, INR testing is not recommended until Pradaxa has been stopped 
for at least 2 days.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
As no dedicated dose-finding study was performed to support the aVTEt and sVTEp indications,the dose 
of DE 150 mg b.i.d. was chosen because a higher dose of 300 mg b.i.d. resulted in increased rates of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 92/146 
  
  
 
 
 
bleeding events, and dose-finding trials that were conducted for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery 
and NVAF found the dose of 150 mg b.i.d. to be favourable.. Similarities in study populations suggested 
that the dose could be extrapolated to patients with VTE. The Applicant’s rationale for dose selection was 
largely considered acceptable. The MAH subsequently accepted a posology identical to that of the SPAF 
indication, i.e. recommendation of a reduced dose recommendations (daily dose of 220 mg taken as two 
110 mg capsules) for patients aged 80 years or above and for patients who receive concomitant 
verapamil, as well as recommendations to consider this dose for other subgroups. This is acceptable. 
Overall, all four main studies the studies were well designed and conducted. The warfarin treatment was 
not optimal in the three active-referenced studies, and time in the therapeutic range (TTR) fell below 
what can be achieved in some EU/EES countries. This was a concern since it may have presented a bias 
disfavouring the warfarin treatment arms. However, the TTR levels in the DE studies were comparable to 
other recent VTE studies. Further, the Applicant also presented the primary efficacy endpoint and one 
secondary efficacy endpoint (VTE and all death) by five approximately equally sized groups (quintiles) of 
patients according to their TTR. There was no clear relationship between TTR range and the two efficacy 
endpoints.  
In all three studies, warfarin outperformed DE numerically – although non-inferiority was formally shown 
in the studies. It has been sufficiently documented that the efficacy of DE is similar to that of warfarin 
and thus acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical safety 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Brief summary of existing safety profile 
In the four actively controlled VTE prevention trials in orthopaedic surgery, more than 5,000 were treated 
with 150 mg or 220 mg daily of DE (DE), while about 400 received doses less than 150 mg daily and 
about 1,200 received doses in excess of 220 mg daily. In the pivotal study investigating the prevention of 
stroke and SEE in patients with atrial fibrillation (the RE-LY study), about 12,000 patients were 
randomized to DE. About half were treated with 150 mg b.i.d., and about half received 110 mg b.i.d. 
About 9 % of patients treated for elective hip or knee surgery (short-term treatment for up to 42 days) 
and 22 % of patient with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE (long-term 
treatment for up to 3 years) experienced adverse reactions. 
As expected with an anticoagulant, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were bleedings 
occurring in approximately 14 % of patients treated short-term for elective hip or knee replacement 
surgery, and 16.5 % in patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and SEE. 
Bleedings, in particular gastrointestinal bleedings, have been the most prominent adverse effects of DE, 
also in the post-marketing setting. 
In addition to gastrointestinal bleedings, other gastrointestinal adverse effects such as abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, dyspepsia and nausea are commonly attributed to treatment with DE. 
Safety analyses in the aVTEt and sVTEp programme 
All four studies (studies 1160.53 and 1160.46 (RE-COVER and RE-COVER II), Study 1160.47 (RE-MEDY) 
and Study 1160.63 (RE-SONATE) were combined efficacy and safety studies.  
Safety was assessed based on:

1.  Incidence of bleeding events 
a.  Major Bleeding Events (MBEs) 
b.  MBEs and Clinically Relevant Bleeding Events (CRBEs) 
c.  any bleeding events (MBEs, CRBEs, and nuisance bleeding events) 
2.  Adverse Events (AEs; including findings in the physical examination) 
3.  Discontinuation of study treatment due to Aes 
4.  Laboratory measures, especially Liver Function Tests (LFTs) 
5.  Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) 
6.  Vital signs 
All safety analyses were based on the treated set, which consisted of all randomised patients who were 
documented to have taken at least 1 dose of study drug. The safety data for these patients were 
analysed according to the treatment they actually received. In case a patient received more than one 
treatment in a study, the first medication kit used by the patient determined the treatment group 
assignment.  
The definition for the main safety endpoint, MBEs, followed the recommendations of the International 
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). 
All bleeding events were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee that was blinded with regard 
to the treatment allocation of patients. Adjudicated results were used in the analyses of bleeding events. 
The analyses of bleeding events for all four pivotal studies include those reported from the first intake of 
active study drug in the sVTEp studies (1160.46 and 1160.53) and from the start of oral only treatment 
(double-dummy treatment) in the aVTEt studies (1160.47 and 1160.63) up to 6 days after the last intake 
of study drug. 
According to clinical practice, oral treatment with warfarin was initiated while receiving parenteral 
treatment in the aVTEt studies. In contrast, patients randomised to DE, were immediately switched from 
parenteral anticoagulant therapy to DE (i.e., no overlap between both treatments necessary). To ensure 
blinding, patients randomised to DE received W-placebo in the overlapping period of parental and oral 
treatment, and this period is mentioned as the “Single-dummy period”. When parental treatment was 
stopped, all patients received treatment with study-medication and this period is mentioned as the 
“Double-dummy period”. Due to this difference, three counting scenarios for adverse events (AEs) are 
possible (Figure 6.3.1:1).

The MAH states that the preferred analyses of all bleeding events from the aVTEt studies (1160.46 and 
1160.53) included those that were reported after first intake of study drug at the start of oral only 
treatment (double-dummy treatment). This comparison has the advantage of avoiding differences which 
are created by the nature of uptitration with warfarin (which leads to an overlap with the parenteral 
drug), which DE does not need. In order to provide a complete analysis, two alternative methods of 
counting bleeding events (from first intake of any active treatment [DE or W] and from first intake of any

treatment [parenteral, DE or DE-placebo, warfarin or W-placebo]; Table 6.3.1: 1) were also explored for 
the aVTEt studies. The safety database for DE 150 mg b.i.d. comprises all patients included in the two 
aVTEt studies (1160.53 and 1160.46) and all patients included in the two sVTEp studies (1160.47 and 
1160.63). Including all patients from these studies, provides the ability to assess the safety profile of DE 
in the two indications for which marketing authorisation is being sought. Furthermore, the safety of DE 
following continuous treatment from an aVTEt study to a sVTEp study was also evaluated as well as the 
safety of DE after patients were re-allocated from DE to warfarin or from warfarin to DE. 
Patient exposure 
All patients included in the pivotal studies and randomised to DE were treated with the dose of 150 mg 
b.i.d., which is also the dose sought for in both indications.The two aVTEt studies (1160.46 and 1160.53) 
provide data for the safety of DE used in the acute treatment of VTE, whereas the two sVTEp studies 
(1160.47 and 1160.63) provide data for the safety of DE used in the prophylactic treatment of recurrence 
of VTE as well as the long-term safety (12-36 months) for use in the sought indications. Table 1.2.1:1 
shows the number of patients randomised and treated in each of the pivotal studies. 
A total of 8,197 unique patients were randomised in the four pivotal studies and 8,132 (99.3%) were 
treated with study drug. Across the studies, a total of 4,667 patients were treated with DE, 3,980 were 
treated with warfarin and 659 were treated with placebo.  
The aVTEt studies (1160.46 and 1160.53) included 5,153 randomised and 5,107 treated patients. A total 
of 1,175 patients included in one of the aVTEt studies continued into one of the sVTEp studies (1160.47 
and 1160.63) and were re-randomised (rollover patients), and 3,044 non-rollover patients were 
randomised into the sVTEp studies (1160.47 and 1160.63).  
Table 1.2.3:1 shows the patients disposition for all four pivotal studies.

Table 1.2.2:1 shows the duration of exposure to study drug after randomisation in the double-dummy 
period during the treatment period in the four pooled pivotal VTE studies. 
Table 1.2.2:2 shows the exposure to study drug during the double-dummy period in the pooled aVTEt 
studies (1160.46 and 1160.53), and Tables 1.2.2:3 and 1.2.2:5 show the exposure to study drug during 
the double-dummy period in the two sVTEp studies (1160.47 and 1160.63). 
As seen from the tables, median exposure to any study medication was 174 days in the two pivotal aVTEt 
studies (1160.46 and 1160.53), 534 days in the long-term sVTEp Study 1160.47, and 182 days in the 
short-term sVTEp Study 1160.63.  
Mean treatment duration for the pooled VTE studies was 278 days for DE, 298 days for warfarin and 162 
days for placebo. The maximum duration of continuous treatment for any patient treated with DE was 
1,210 days (~40 months).  
Safety data beyond 6 months were available for 2,214 (67.6%) DE patients, 1,670 (45.0%) warfarin 
patients and 445 (67.6%) placebo patients. Safety data >12 months were available for 1,043 (23.8%) 
DE patients, 1,034 (27.9%) warfarin patients and 0 placebo patients (Table 1.2.2:1). 
As the safety set is the same as the treated set, patient disposition and patient demographic for patients 
included in the safety set did not differ from the patients included in the efficacy data set, please refer to 
relevant efficacy sections. Demographic characteristics were generally similar among the four pivotal 
studies and also between the treatment groups within those studies.

Overall, there was no meaningful difference in demographic characteristics between the treatment 
groups. Moreover, the demographic characteristics were generally similar among the 4 pivotal studies 
and between the treatment groups within those studies. Mean age in the pivotal studies was 
approximately 55 years, around 30% of all included patients were >65 years of age and an acceptable 
amount of patients (8-9%) were >75 years old. Overall, 60% were males and the majority (>85%) of 
the included patients were white. Most patients (>75%) had a normal kidney function, with mean GRF 
above 100 ml/min, 72% of all included patients had a GFR ≥80 ml/min and 22% had a GFR 50- <80 
ml/min.  
The patients' medical history was in general similar between the treatment groups. Slightly more patients 
in the DE group in Study 1160.47 had hypertension (DE: 40.7%, W: 36.5%), diabetes mellitus (DE: 
10.5%, W: 7.6%) and coronary artery disease (DE: 8.4%, W: 6.1%).  
Concomitant medication use in the pivotal studies reflected the medical conditions present in the patient 
populations. Accordingly, cardiovascular medication use was reported for approximately half of all 
patients for each pooling of the data, with no difference between treatment groups. An exception was 
Study 1160.63 where concomitant cardiovascular medication was used more often in the DE group 
(52.5%) than the placebo group (45.1%). In contrast, in Study 1160.47 where more patients in the DE 
group had concomitant cardiovascular diseases, there was no clinically relevant difference in the 
percentage of patients with use of any cardiovascular medication of special interest (53.0% vs. 53.5%). 
Antithrombotic agents, platelet inhibitors, or NSAIDs use was reported for 19.7% – 29.3% of patients in 
the four VTE studies, with similar use in both treatment groups. Only few patients reported the use of P-
gp inhibitors (around 2% in the different studies) and inducers (<1% in all studies) with no notable 
difference between the treatment groups.  
At least one risk factor for recurrent VTE was reported for the majority (70.7%) of patients in the pooled 
pivotal VTE studies. The most frequently reported risk factor was previous VTE (41.0%), which, as would 
be expected, also had a lower incidence in the pooled aVTEt studies (21.5%) versus the individual sVTEp 
studies (Study 1160.47: 53.4%, Study 1160.63: 99.9%). The high percentage in Study 1160.63 reflects 
that prior VTE was an inclusion criterion.

The majority of patients (66.2-67.0%) in the four pivotal studies had a qualifying event of DVT only; PE 
only was the qualifying event in 22.8-27.2% of patients, and DVT+PE was the qualifying event for 6.7-
10.3% of patients. 
Adverse events 
Patients received DE 150 b.i.d. in all 4 pivotal studies, warfarin as a comparator in studies 1160.53, 
1160.46 (the two 6-month aVTEt studies), and 1160.47 (one of the two sVTEp studies, treatment 
duration of up to 36 months), and placebo as a comparator in 1160.63 (the other sVTEp study with 
treatment duration of 6 months).  
An overall summary of AEs in the combined pool of all four VTE studies (aVTEt + sVTEp) is provided in 
Table 2.3.1.2: 1. 
Across all the active-controlled studies 66-72% of patients treated with DE and 67-72% of patients 
treated with warfarin experienced an AE. There was a small difference in favour of DE in the percentage 
of AEs between the two treatment groups across the active controlled studies. In the placebo-controlled 
Study 1160.63, fewer patients experienced an AE 49-51% in the two treatment groups compared to the 
active controlled studies, with no difference between the two treatment groups.  
In all four studies, AEs most often were within the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections and 
infestations and Muscoloskeletal and connective tissues disorders. The most frequent reported AEs were 
headache and pain in extremities. 
A summary of the most common (≥1% in any group) AEs in the pooled pivotal studies is presented in 
Table 2.3.1.2: 2.

As seen from the table 2.3.1.2:2, more patients treated with warfarin compared to patients treated with 
DE experienced AEs within the following SOCs: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 103/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (13.5% vs. 16.7%) which was mainly due to more 
patients with epistaxis in the warfarin group (2.8% vs. 6.1%).  
Injury poisoning and procedural complications (10.3% vs. 13.4%) which were mainly due to more 
patients with contusions in the warfarin group (2.7% vs. 4.3%). 
Vascular disorders (9.8% vs. 11.7%) which were mainly due to more patients with haematomas in the 
warfarin group (1.6% vs. 2.9%). 
Renal and urinary tract disorders (4.2% vs. 6.5%) which were mainly due to more patients with 
haematuria in the warfarin group (1.8% vs. 3.7%). 
More patients treated with DE compared to patients treated with warfarin experienced AEs within the 
following SOC: 
Gastrointestinal disorders (24.7% vs. 22.7%) which were mainly due to more patients with dyspepsia 
(4.5% vs. 3.8%) and rectal haemorrhage (2.7 vs. 4.3%) in the DE group.  
Overall, dyspepsia-/gastritis-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rectal bleeding were the 
most frequently reported GI AEs in DE patients and were all (with exception of nausea and vomiting) 
seen more commonly among patients treated with DE compared with patients treated with warfarin and 
placebo. Other bleeding disorders including conjuntival haemorrhage, epistaxis, haemopthysis, 
haematuria, menorhagia and haematomas were all seen more often in the warfarin group compared with 
the DE group. No difference was seen in the frequency of anaemia (1.2% and 1.3% respectively in the 
DE and the warfarin groups) and elevated alanine aminotransferase was also reported equally in the two 
active treatment groups (1.1% and 1.3% respectively in the DE and the warfarin groups).  
Pulmonary embolism was reported slightly more frequent in the DE group (1.0%) compared to the 
warfarin group (0.7%). There was a small difference in the frequency of DVT between the two treatment 
groups (1.4% vs. 1.6% in the DE and the warfarin group respectively). These results are discussed in the 
efficacy section of this assessment report. 
The GI system was the SOC with the highest incidence of investigator-reported drug-related AEs (DE: 
7.0%; W: 5.7%). Also AEs within the SOC of “Infection and infestation” and “Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders” were commonly reported. The two most commonly reported AEs were the 
preferred terms headache and pain in extremities 
In the pooled pivotal studies cardiac disorders were reported equally in the two active treatment groups; 
3.9% and 4.0% in the DE and warfarin group respectively.  
Suspected cardiovascular adverse events occurred more often in the active controlled studies (0.9 - 2.0% 
in the DE group and 0.6 - 1.3% in the warfarin group) compared to the placebo-controlled study (0.4% 
and 0.3% in the DE and placebo group respectively). The lower number seen in the placebo-controlled 
study is probably due to the more restricted inclusion criteria.  
Most investigator-reported AEs were mild or moderate in intensity for all treatment groups in all pivotal 
studies. The proportion of patients with severe AEs was similar in the two active treatment groups (9.1% 
in the DE group and 10.1% in the warfarin group). Most severe AEs were reported in ≤0.2% of patients 
in any treatment group. The only severe AEs that occurred in ≥0.5% of patients in any treatment group 
included investigator-reported AEs of DVT (DE: 0.5%, W: 0.5%, placebo: 1.1%) and PE (DE: 0.5%; W: 
0.4%; placebo: 1.4%).  
aVTEt studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 104/146 
  
  
 
 
 
The AE profile for the pooled aVTEt studies was generally similar to the profile for all pooled pivotal 
studies (Table not shown). In the DE group 66.7% of all patients reported any AEs compared with 69.8% 
in the warfarin group. More patients in the warfarin group (20.3%) had an investigator-defined drug-
related AE compared with patients in the DE group (15.3%). Severe AEs were reported for 13.0% in the 
DE group and 12.4% in the warfarin group.  
Overall, the most frequently reported AEs (incidence of at least 5%) in the DE group in the pooled aVTEt 
studies were extremity pain (5.5%) and headache (5.4%) both of which occurred at a comparable 
incidence in the warfarin group (extremity pain 4.6% and headache 6.2%). As was the case in the pooled 
pivotal studies, PE was seen more often in the DE group (1.3% vs. 0.9% in the warfarin group). 
Dyspepsia, gastritis, gastrointestinal reflux disease and rectal haemorrhage were also reported more 
often in the DE group compared to the warfarin group. Minor non-GI bleeding disorders including 
conjuntival haemorrhage, epistaxis, haemopthysis, haematuria, menorhagia and haematomas were all 
reported more often in the warfarin group compared with the DE group. Anaemia was also reported more 
often in the DE group compared with the warfarin group (1.0% vs. 1.5%). No difference was seen in the 
frequency of elevated alanine aminotransferase (1.2% in both treatment groups), whereas INR, as could 
be expected, was increased more often in the warfarin group compared to the DE group.  
sVTEp studies 
Reported AEs in the long-term active-controlled sVTEp Study 1160.47 are presented in Table 2.3.1.4:1.  
Generally more gastritis-like symptoms and rectal haemorrhage were reported in patients treated with DE 
compared to patients treated with W. Minor non-GI bleeding disorders were reported more often in 
patients treated with W.  
Patients were allowed to roll-over from each of the aVTEt studies (Study 1160.53 or 1160.46) into the 
active-controlled sVTEp Study 1160.47 but could also enter the study directly. Overall, 1,097 patients 
randomised patients in Study 1160.47 were roll-over patients from one of the previous aVTEt studies. For 
these patients, AEs were analysed by prior treatment assignment in an aVTEt study (i.e. previous 
treatment with DE or W). 
The incidence of patients with any AE was similar between the DE and warfarin groups for patients who 
had previously received DE, patients who had previously received W, and for non-roll-over patients (Table 
2.3.1.5: 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 105/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Patients remaining on the same therapy after rolling over (i.e., DE→DE or W→W) had fewer severe AEs, 
serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs with fatal outcomes than patients changing 
therapies.  
The incidence of any AE (70.7% and 69.9% respectively) and severe events was the same (10.0% and 
10.6% respectively) between the DE and warfarin groups for non-roll-over patients. The incidence of 
drug-related AEs was lower in the DE group compared to warfarin for non-roll-over patients.  
Patients who were allocated to a different treatment (DE→W or W→DE) exhibited some differences in 
their patterns of reported AEs. Patients who started with DE and were reallocated to warfarin (DE→W) 
had more haematomas, ecchymosis, haemarthrosis, menorrhagia, and contusions than W→DE patients. 
Lower GI bleeding was more common in W→DE patients when compared to DE→W patients. 
Study 1160.63 was a placebo-controlled sVTEp study with an intended treatment period of 6 months and 
a 12-month extended follow-up period after the last intake of study drug. During the treatment period, 
the incidence of most types of investigator-reported AEs (any AE, severe AEs, and other significant AEs) 
was similar between the DE and placebo groups in Study 1160.63. The incidence of drug-related AEs was 
higher in the DE group (11.5%) compared to placebo (6.5%). Conversely, the incidence of patients with 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation (7.3% vs. 12.3%) and SAEs (7.3% vs. 9.4%) was lower in the 
DE group compared to placebo. This was mainly due to a higher incidence of investigator-reported AEs of 
DVT (5.3% vs. 0.4%) and PE (3.2% vs. 0.3%) in placebo patients compared to DE. 
The SOC with the highest incidence of investigator-reported AEs in patients treated with DE was GI 
disorders. The overall incidence of patients with GI disorders was 16.7% in DE patients and 9.1% in 
placebo patients. The most frequently reported AEs (incidence of at least 3%) in the DE group were 
dyspepsia (4.1% vs. 1.2%), back pain (3.1% vs. 1.5%), extremity pain (3.2% vs. 3.6%), and headache 
(3.1% vs. 3.0%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 106/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence of most of the common non-bleeding GI AEs (dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastritis, abdominal 
pain and vomiting) was higher in patients treated with DE compared to placebo. Likewise, the incidence 
of the most common investigator-reported AEs associated with minor bleeding (haematoma, epistaxis, 
rectal haemorrhage, and contusion) was also higher in patients treated with DE compared to placebo. 
In the pooled pivotal studies as well as in the individual studies, mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure results were generally 1 to 2 mmHg lower than baseline throughout the trials, with no clinically 
meaningful differences between treatment groups.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
As the dose of DE in all pivotal was 150 mg b.i.d., all serious adverse events (SAEs) below refer to this 
dose. In the pooled pivotal VTE studies, SAEs were reported in 13.8% of patients treated with DE, 14.5% 
of patients treated with warfarin and 9.4% of patients treated with placebo. Across the three active-
controlled pivotal studies (1160.46, 1160.53 and 1160.47), 11.8-15.9% patients experienced an SAE. In 
all three studies slightly more patients in the DE group (12.2-15.9%) experienced an SAE compared to 
the warfarin group (11.8-15.7%) and in all three studies slightly more patients treated with DE (0.7-
1.0%) compared to patients treated with warfarin (0.4-0.8%) experienced DVT. The same pattern was 
seen for PE, DE: 0.6-1.1% vs. W: 0.2-0.9%.  In the placebo-controlled study (1160.63) more patients 
treated with placebo compared to DE experienced SEAs (6.9% vs. 9.1%). This was mostly due to more 
patients in the placebo group experienced DVT and PE (DVT: 0.3% vs. 2.3%; PE: 0.1% vs. 2.4%). In all 
four pivotal studies, the most frequently reported SAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and 
infestations, neoplasms and DVT and PE. In Study 1160.47, also (acute) myocardial infarctions was 
frequently reported (see below). Accordingly, SAEs most frequently occurred within the SOCs 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and also Infections and 
infestations and Neoplasms.  
Bleedings 
The risk of bleedings is the most important safety topic related to the use of DE. Bleedings are described 
and assessed in this section even if some of them are do not fulfill the criteria for being SAEs.This section 
provides an assessment of adjudicated bleeding events (confirmed MBEs, CRBEs and any bleeding events 
[includes MBEs, CRBEs and nuisance/trivial bleeding]) for the four pivotal VTE studies. CRBEs generally 
reflect bleeding events that required medical evaluation/intervention/testing and, thus, in addition to 
inconveniencing patients by requiring visits to emergency departments or physician's offices also required 
expenditures of funds. 
The site of all bleeding events (for MBEs, CRBEs, and nuisance/trivial bleeding) presented in this 
assessment are based on the investigator’s assessment, except for Study 1160.63 where the bleeding 
location was categorized by the independent adjudication committee. Four events of minor bleeding with 
a location of intracranial (the events were, e.g., nose bleeds, all in warfarin patients) did not technically 
meet the definition of an ICH and were therefore not counted as MBEs. The analyses of bleeding events 
reported in the aVTEt studies (1160.53 and 1160.46) were performed based on 3 possible counting 
scenarios, as described previously in section 4.1. For the sVTEp studies, bleeding events are analyzed for 
the period starting with first intake of active study drug or placebo through 6 days after last intake of any 
study drug. Different counting scenarios were not investigated for the sVTEp studies as these studies only 
had one treatment period and patients in both treatment groups started dosing at the same time. The 
preferred counting scenario is the one including bleeding events from the aVTEt studies that were 
reported after first intake of study drug at the start of oral only treatment (double-dummy treatment).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 107/146 
  
  
 
 
 
Hence, the main focus of the following presentation and assessment of results is bleeding events that 
were reported after the first intake of study treatment (for the aVTEt studies, from start of doubledummy 
treatment) or placebo, up to 6 days after last intake of any study drug, except for rollover patients.  
aVTE studies – by different counting scenarios 
Bleeding events (MBEs, life-threatening MBEs, intracranial MBEs, MBEs/CRBEs, and any bleeding events) 
were analyzed using all 3 counting methods for the aVTEt studies and are presented in Table 2.1.1: 1. 
Using the preferred counting scenario (double-dummy treatment), the DE:W HR for MBEs was in favor of 
DE (0.60) and was statistically significant. The DE:W HRs also favored DE for both MBEs/CRBEs (0.56) 
and any bleeding (0.67), and the differences were statistically significant. 
However, also when using the two alternative counting scenarios, the DE:W HR was generally in favour of 
DE with the exception of life-threatening bleedings using the “Any treatment” scenario where the 95% 
confidence interval was wide. 
Major bleeding events (MBEs) 
MBEs are presented for all four studies individually and for the pooled aVTEt studies in Table 6.3.3: 1. 
MBEs were reported less frequently in DE patients compared to warfarin patients in the pooled aVTEt 
studies (1.0% vs. 1.6%, respectively from the start of oral only treatment [doubledummy treatment]) 
and in Study 1160.47 (0.9% vs. 1.8%, respectively). The HR of DE over warfarin for MBEs from the start 
of oral only treatment (double-dummy treatment) was statistically significant for the pooled aVTEt 
studies, but only for one of the individual aVTEt studies. While the HRs favored DE over W, in Study 
1160.47 the result was not statistically significant. In the placebo-controlled Study 1160.63, there were 2 
(0.3%; 2/684) DE-treated patients and 0 (0%; 0/659) P-treated patients with an MBE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 108/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In the pooled analysis of all four VTE studies, MBEs occurred less frequently in DE patients compared to 
warfarin patients for all categories of MBEs (MBEs, MBEs with a fatal outcome, intracranial MBEs, and 
TIMI major bleeding) as well as for life-threatening bleeding in the pooled all pivotal VTE studies (Table 
2.1.3.1: 2). The pool of all pivotal trials includes the placebo-controlled Study 1160.63, in which 2 of 684 
DE treated patients had an MBE (0.3%) and none of 659 placebo treated patients had an MBE (Table 
6.3.3: 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 109/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In the pooled aVTEt studies, from the start of double-dummy treatment, the rate of MBEs was lower in 
DE patients compared to warfarin patients (2.1 vs. 3.6 MBEs/100 pt-years). The incidence of MBEs was 
lower in the DE group compared to the warfarin group for all categories of MBEs (MBEs, adjudicated MBEs 
with a fatal outcome, intracranial MBEs, and TIMI major bleeding) and the same for life-threatening 
bleeding (where there was a difference of 2 patients) (Table 2.1.3.2: 2). The incidence of MBEs/CRBEs 
was also lower in the DE group (4.4%) than the warfarin group (7.7%). 
With regard to bleeding location for MBEs, investigator-reported GI bleeding was the most common MBE 
bleeding location for patients treated with DE. GI and urogenital bleeding were the most common MBE 
bleeding locations for patients treated with W. From the start of double-dummy treatment, the incidence 
of GI MBE bleedings was 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively (Table 2.1.3.2:4). GI bleeding (MBEs and any 
bleeding) is discussed later. 
Assessment report

Page 110/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In the active-referenced sVTEp study (1160.47), investigator-reported GI bleeding was the most common 
MBE bleeding location for patients treated with W. The most common MBE bleeding locations for patients 
treated with DE were GI and intraocular. The incidence of patients with GI MBEs was lower in the DE 
group (0.3%) compared to the warfarin group (0.6%) in this study (Table 2.1.3.3: 3).

Clinically relevant bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) 
MBEs/CRBEs are presented for all four studies individually and for the pooled aVTEt studies in Table 
6.3.4: 1. Consistent with the results for MBEs, the incidence of patients with an MBE or a CRBE was also 
lower in DE patients than warfarin patients in the pooled aVTEt studies (4.4% vs. 7.7%, from the start of 
oral only treatment [double-dummy treatment]) and in the sVTEp Study 1160.47 (5.6% vs. 10.2%). The 
DE to warfarin HR for MBEs/CRBEs was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.71) from the start of oral only treatment 
(double-dummy treatment) in the pooled aVTEt studies and was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.72) in the sVTEp 
Study 1160.47. The HR of DE over warfarin for MBEs/CRBEs was statistically significant for both analyses.

Any bleeding events 
Any bleeding events are presented for all four studies individually and for the pooled aVTEt studies in 
Table 6.3.5: 1. Any bleeding events include MBEs, CRBEs, and nuisance/trivial bleeding events. DE-
treated patients had fewer any bleeding events than those receiving warfarin and more any bleeding 
events than placebo. For the pooled aVTEt studies, any bleeding events from the start of oral only 
treatment (double-dummy treatment) were reported less frequently in patients receiving DE (14.4%), 
compared to those receiving warfarin (20.4%) with a HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.59, 0.77). Patients treated 
with DE in the sVTEp Study 1160.47 also had a lower any bleed rate (19.4%) compared to those 
receiving warfarin (26.2%), with a DE:W HR for any bleeding of 0.71 (95% CI 0.61, 0.83). 
In the placebo-controlled Study 1160.63, any bleeding events were reported more often in patients 
treated with DE (10.5%) than those treated with placebo (6.1%) with an HR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.20, 
2.61).  
Gastrointestinal bleedings 
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings are of particular interest because DE in other indications have been 
associated with an excess of GI bleedings. GI bleedings may belong to any of the categories MBE, 
MBE/CRBE or any bleeding.  
GI bleedings are presented for all four studies individually and for the pooled aVTEt studies in Table 
2.1.5: 1. The incidence of any bleeding events in the GI system was higher in patients treated with DE 
compared to warfarin (2.9% vs. 2.2% from start of double-dummy treatment for aVTEt pooled, and 3.1% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014

vs. 2.2% Study 1160.47). However, the incidence of MBEs in the GI system in DE patients was similar to 
or lower than patients treated with warfarin for both the aVTEt pooled analysis (0.4% vs. 0.5% from start 
of double-dummy, for aVTEt studies) and for the sVTEp Study 1160.47 (0.3 vs. 0.6%). 
The rate/100 pt-years for GI MBEs was similar for DE and warfarin for the aVTEt pooled (from start of 
double-dummy treatment, 0.9 vs. 1.1) and sVTEp Study 1160.47 (0.2 vs. 0.4) analyses. For the analysis 
of any GI bleeding, the rate/100 pt-years was higher in DE patients compared to warfarin patients in the 
aVTEt pooled (any treatment, 6.7 vs. 5.3 and double-dummy, 6.3 vs. 4.9) and in sVTEp Study 1160.47 
(2.4% vs. 1.7%). 
The incidence of any GI bleeding events was higher in DE patients compared to placebo (0.7% vs. 0.3%) 
in the sVTEp Study 1160.63.

Acute Coronary Syndrome 
All suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) events were reviewed by independent adjudication 
committees in a treatment-blinded fashion in each of the 4 pivotal studies and include cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction and coronary ischemia (Study 1160.53, 1160.46, 1160.47, and 1160.63). 
Table 2.2:1 shows the adjudicated coronary syndrome events for the pivotal studies.

The incidence of definite or likely MI during intake of study drug (+1 day) was lower in warfarin patients 
than DE patients in the pooled aVTEt studies (0.2% vs. 0.4%) and in sVTEp Study 1160.47 (0.1% vs. 
0.8%). When compared with placebo in Study 1160.63, there was one patient in each treatment group 
(DE and placebo) with an MI. Across all studies, one patient with a definite or likely cardiac death during 
intake of study drug (+1 day) was reported, this patient received W 
Table 2.2:1 above only refers to adjudicated ACS event during intake of active study drug + one day. The 
numbers below refer to ACS events reported during the entire study period, thus including events during 
and after intake of active study medication.  
In all four pivotal studies more suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events were seen among 
patients treated with DE compared to patients treated with warfarin or placebo:  
Study 6011.46: DE: 11 (0.9%) patients vs. W: 8 (0.6%) patients  
Study 6011.53: DE: 24 (1.9%) patients vs. W: 17 (1.3%) patients 
Study 6011.47: DE: 30 (2.0%) patients vs. W: 15 (1.0%) patients 
Study 6011.63: DE: 3 (0.4%) patients vs. placebo: 2 (0.3%) patients   
Likewise, more patients treated with DE were adjudicated to have a definite ACS event: 
Study 6011.46: DE: 5 (0.4%) patients vs. W: 1 (0.1%) patients 
Study 6011.53: DE: 11 (0.9%) patients vs. W: 5 (0.4%) patients 
Study 6011.47: DE: 12 (0.8%) patients vs. W: 2 (0.1%) patients 
Study 6011.63: DE: 3 (0.4%) patients vs. placebo: 2 (0.3%) patients   
In the study (116047) where the difference between DE and warfarin was most pronounced, there was a 
statistically significant difference in the risk of definite ACS events during the on-treatment period, with a 
HR of DE vs. warfarin of 4.35 (95% CI 1.24, 15.27) and a p-value of 0.0217. There was a greater 
baseline prevalence of cardiac risk factors in the DE treatment group than in the warfarin treatment 
group. As a post-hoc analysis, the incidence of ACS events adjudicated as definite was analysed for 
patient subgroups. No relevant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed for the any subgroup 
evaluated, including history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. 
The Applicant was requested to further investigate the cardiovascular benefits and risks of DE using a 
composite cardiovascular outcome endpoint. The composite consisted of non-fatal recurrent VTE, non-
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal systemic embolism and all-cause death and was a slight adaptation of 
the one used in the HOKUSAI-VTE study. Consistently across all three warfarin-controlled studies, there 
was a higher incidence in patients on DE compared to warfarin-treated patients although the hazard ratio 
was not statistically significantly different from 1. 
Deaths 
All deaths were adjudicated by the ICAC/VTE/death. The overall incidence of reported AEs with an 
outcome of death for all VTE studies is presented in Table 2.3.2: 1. In the pooled pivotal VTE studies, the 
incidence of investigator-reported AEs with an outcome of death during the treatment period was lower in 
the DE group (1.1%) compared to the warfarin group (1.5%) and was lowest in the placebo group 
(0.3%).  
A summary of investigator-reported AEs with an outcome of death in 2 or more patients in any treatment 
group during the treatment period is presented in Table 2.3.2.1: 1 for the pooled pivotal VTE studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 116/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence of investigator-reported AEs with fatal outcomes was similar between DE and warfarin 
patients in the pooled aVTEt studies and was lower in DE patients than warfarin patients in Study 
1160.47 (0.8% vs. 1.3%). In the placebo-controlled sVTEp study (1160.63), 1 DE patient and 2 placebo 
patients had an investigator-reported AE with an outcome of death. 
Neoplasms were the most frequently reported AEs with an outcome of death. The second most common 
cause of deaths was respiratory disorders: 11 (0.3%) DE patients including 5 patients with PE and 5 
(0.1%) warfarin patients including 4 patients with PE. Overall, PE was the most frequent investigator-
reported AE with an outcome of death in the DE group. Four of the five PE in the DE patients and three of 
the four PE in the warfarin patients occurred in the two aVTEt studies. 
Overall, 2 DE patients and 5 warfarin patients had bleeding events with a fatal outcome during the 
treatment period (onset of bleeding event was within 6 days of the last intake of study drug). Four of 
these patients (1 DE and 3 W) had adjudicated major bleeding events (MBEs) with a fatal outcome 
according to the ICAC/BE during the treatment period and 2 additional warfarin patients had MBEs with a 
fatal outcome according to the ICAC/VTE/Death. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 117/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Investigator-reported AEs of cardiac disorders with an outcome of death were rare (DE: 0.1%, W: 0.2%, 
P: 0.2%) in the pooled VTE studies, and only one adjudicated ACS event had a fatal outcome.  
For the roll-over patients in Study 1160.47, there appeared to be a higher incidence of investigator-
reported AEs with an outcome of death for patients who were allocated to a different treatment in Study 
1160.47 compared to those who continued with the same treatment (DE→W: 2.3%, W→DE: 2.3% 
compared to DE→DE: 0%, W→W: 1.1%).  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory parameters, introduction 
All analyses of laboratory data were based on normalised values. Safety laboratory parameters were 
analysed by descriptive statistics (each visit, categorised time windows, last value on treatment, worst 
value on treatment, and changes from baseline), by transitions relative to reference range (low, normal, 
high) at baseline and last value on treatment (and worst value on treatment for liver function test 
results), and by possible clinically significant abnormalities (increase or decrease from baseline).  
In the following, analysis of liver parameters is described separately.  
Laboratory parameters, liver function parameters 
Analyses of liver function tests results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were 
periodically performed to evaluate the potential for drug-induced liver injury according to the FDA 
Guidance for Industry, Drug-Induced Liver Injury: pre-marketing clinical evaluation. Liver function 
parameters and transitions relative to the reference range from baseline to worst and last value on 
treatment and possibly clinically significant abnormalities including the number of patients whose 
laboratory parameters returned to a normal range were summarised based on actual local or central 
laboratory results and reference ranges. 
Results from the early registration studies as well as post marketing experience do not indicate any 
hepatotoxic effect of DE.  
Mean changes from baseline and transitions relative to reference range 
In all four pivotal studies, no clinically relevant treatment differences were observed for the means of the 
baseline value, last value on treatment, and the maximum post-baseline value for ALT, AST, ALP and 
bilirubin. Neither did analysis of the transitions relative to reference ranges from baseline to the last value 
of treatment and the maximum value on treatment reveal any meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups in any of the four pivotal studies.  
For ALT, AST, and ALP the incidence of transitions to above the reference range from baseline to the last 
on-treatment value and to the worst on-treatment value were higher in the DE and warfarin groups 
compared with the placebo group. For bilirubin, the incidence of transitions to above the reference range 
from baseline to the last on-treatment value was similar among the three treatment groups whereas the 
incidence of transitions to above the reference range from baseline to the worst on-treatment value was 
higher in the DE and warfarin groups compared with the placebo group.  
Additional analyses of LFT elevations of individual parameters and review of cases with ALT >3 x ULN by 
Hepatic Review Panel 
The majority of patients with elevated LFT values had only minor elevations in ALT and/or AST and values 
of ≥2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were infrequent in all four studies. Table 3.1.4: 1 shows the 
frequencies and magnitudes of LFT values elevation >3 x ULN for the pooled pivotal studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 118/146 
  
  
 
 
 
As seen, LFT elevations in the different ULN categories were reported more frequently for the DE and 
warfarin groups compared with the placebo group. Numerically more patients treated with warfarin had 
ALT and AST values elevation >5 x ULN. 
In Study 1160.47 and 1160.53, cases with ALT >3 x ULN were reviewed by a Hepatic Review Panel 
(HRP). In these two studies, a total of 68 patients treated with DE and 82 patients treated with warfarin 
were assessed by the HRP for their causal relationship of the ALT elevations with any study drug. In 4 DE 
treated and 2 warfarin treated patients the assessment was “probably related” (defined as a good 
temporal relationship with study drug intake was present and no other obvious potential cause for the 
elevations was identified).  
Possible clinically significant abnormalities and potential Hy’s law cases  
Possible clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) were specified by the Investigator applying MAH (BI)’s 
standard definitions of PCSAs.  
No relevant differences in the frequencies of PCSAs between the treatment groups were observed for any 
of the four liver function parameters in any of the four pivotal studies. In all four studies, PCSAs were 
most frequently reported for ALT, followed by AST.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 119/146 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Overall, PCSAs were reported at similar or slightly lower frequencies in the DE group (0.6%-2.3% within 
the different liver function test results [LFT] results) compared with warfarin (0.7%-2.9% within the 
different LFTs), but more frequently than placebo (0%-0.8% within the different LFTs) for all LFT results 
(Table 3.1.3: 1). 
Possible clinically significant abnormalities in LFT values resolved in 44% (ALP) to 77% (ALT) among 
patients treated with DE and for 47% (ALP) to 70% (ALT) among patients treated with W.  
Hy’s law is (a prognostic indicator of a pure drug-induced liver injury) is defined as patients with 
elevations of ALT or AST >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) who had also elevations of total bilirubin of >2 
x ULN ± 30 days of the transaminase elevation. In the four pivotal studies, 6 patients treated with DE, 7 
patients treated with warfarin and 0 patients treated with placebo experienced elevation in liver function 
test values fulfilling the criteria for potential Hy’s law cases. For all patients treated with DE and 6 of the 
7 patients treated with warfarin there was a good explanation for the elevation of ALT and bilirubin. The 
last patient (included in Study 1160.46) treated with warfarin had concomitant disease (MRCP confirmed 
cholecystolithiasis) as well as he was treated with medication also know to be able to induced elevated 
liver parameters (atorvastatin and ampicillin/sulbactam) thus, overall, there was no strong evidence of a 
Hy’s law case in any of the pivotal studies. 
Abnormal laboratory liver function parameters reported as adverse events 
Only few cases of abnormal laboratory liver function parameters were reported as adverse events. The 
most frequently reported AE was increase in ALT, which was reported in less than 1% of the patients in 
all four studies and with no difference between treatment groups. Increased AST levels were reported in 
0.2%-0.5% in all patients groups also with no clinically meaningful difference between treatment groups. 
Only in very few cases, the AEs were leading to study drug discontinuation or reported as SAEs.  
Liver function parameters, conclusion 
Mean changes from baseline were small and no clinically relevant difference between DE and warfarin was 
seen. Most changes from baseline were not considered to be clinically relevant and there were no 
differences in the frequencies of possible clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) between the 
treatment groups in any of the 4 liver function parameters in any of the four pivotal studies. The most 
frequent reported PCSA was elevated ALT followed by elevated AST. In total less than 20 cases fulfilled 
the criteria for potential Hy’s law cases however, review of the cases showed other more likely 
explanations for the elevated LFT values, thus there was no strong evidence of a Hy’s law case in any of 
the pivotal studies. Only few cases of abnormal laboratory liver function parameters were reported as 
(serious) adverse events.

Laboratory parameters other than liver function parameters 
Standard haematology and clinical chemistry parameters were analysed descriptively for changes from 
baseline to the last on treatment value and for the worst value on treatment for studies 1160.53, 
1160.46, and 1160.47. Transitions relative to the reference range from baseline to worst and last value 
on treatment and possibly clinically significant abnormalities including the number of patients whose 
laboratory parameters returned to a normal range were summarised based on normalised values. 
Regarding creatinine clearance, the Cockcroft-Gault formula was used to estimate creatinine clearance in 
all four pivotal studies.  
Due to the few patients having other parameters than liver function parameters tested during the trial of 
1160.63, comparison of DE with placebo is not possible. 
There were no clinically relevant important differences in median haematology, electrolyte, creatinine, 
and urea values between the DE and warfarin groups.  
Changes in the median values from baseline to the last on-treatment value and to the worst on-treatment 
value were generally small and did not show any clinically important differences between the DE and 
warfarin groups. Specifically, no differences were seen in creatinine. 
Possible clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) in laboratory values (other than liver function 
parameters) were in general low in all studies (1160.46, 1160.47 and 1160.53) and with no clinically 
relevant difference between the DE and the warfarin groups. Decrease in haematocrit was the most often 
reported PCSA and was reported in 3.5% (Study 1160.53) – 4.4% (Study 1160.46) of patients in the DE-
groups and in 4.6% (Study 1160.47) – 4.9% (Study 1160.46) of patients in the W-groups.  
Increase in creatinine was reported in 1.6% (Study 1160.46) – 2.5% (Study 1160.47) of DE treated 
patients with no difference as compared with warfarin (1.7% - 2.9%).   
Changes in white blood cell counts, platelets, sodium and potassium considered as PCSAs was reported in 
<1% of all patients in both treatment groups.   
Safety in special populations 
The intrinsic factors of primary interest for DE are renal function and age. Also gender, ethnicity and BMI 
are briefly presented. Further analyses of intrinsic factors were investigated for bleedings. These are 
summarised at the end of this section.  
Renal function 
A summary of bleeding events by renal impairment category is presented in Table 6.3.6: 1. All presented 
data are from the start of oral only treatment (double-dummy treatment). 
Few patients had CrCl <30 mL/min at baseline in the pooled aVTEt studies or in Study 1160.47. None of 
these patients had MBEs. Administration of DE to patients with CrCl <30 mL/min is contraindicated. 
In VTE patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl of 30 to <50 mL/min), the incidence of MBEs in the 
pooled aVTEt studies was higher for DE patients (6/106; 5.7%) compared to warfarin (5/114; 4.4%). The 
difference between the groups is 1 patient. Additionally, DE-treated patients had a higher percentage of 
MBEs/CRBEs in VTE patients with moderate renal impairment compared to W, although numerically they 
were the same. The incidence of bleeding events in VTE patients with moderate renal impairment was 
lower in DE patients compared to warfarin patients in all other instances (MBEs and MBEs/CRBEs in Study 
1160.47, and any bleeding in aVTEt pooled and Study 1160.47). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 121/146 
  
  
 
 
 
For patients with CrCl of 50 to <80 mL/min and ≥80 mL/min, the incidence of patients with MBEs, 
MBEs/CRBEs, and any bleeding events was lower in DE patients compared to warfarin patients in the 
pooled aVTEt studies and sVTEp Study 1160.47. 
Age 
A summary of bleeding events by renal impairment category is presented in Table 5.1.1.2: 1. Data from 
start of any treatment as well as from the start of oral only treatment (double-dummy treatment) are 
presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 122/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence of bleeding events appears to increase with age for both DE and warfarin patients. The 
incidence of bleeding (MBEs, MBE/CRBEs, and any bleeding) was lower in DE patients compared with 
warfarin in the pooled aVTEt studied and sVTEp Study 1160.47, in most age subgroups analyzed – with 
the exception of MBEs in patients more than 75 years (aVTEt) and in MBEs and MBEs/CRBEs in patients in 
the age range 65-75 years (sVTEp Study 1160.47).

Page 123/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Gender 
Overall, 59.2% of patients were men in the pooled pivotal VTE studies. Women tended to have a slightly 
higher frequency of investigator-reported AEs compared with men in the DE (70.6% and 64.1%, 
respectively) and warfarin groups (74.1% and 69.6%). Conversely, men had a higher frequency of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 124/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
investigator-reported AEs compared with women in the placebo group (51.4% and 47.1%, respectively). 
The overall frequency of investigator-reported AEs was higher in active treatment groups compared with 
the placebo group for both genders. 
The overall pattern of AE frequencies by gender was mostly similar to those reported in the overall 
assessment of investigator-reported AEs. However, GI disorders were reported at a higher frequency in 
women than men for both the DE group and the warfarin group, and the difference was more pronounced 
in the DE group. 
Ethnicity 
The overall frequency of investigator-reported AEs appeared to be higher in African patients compared 
with Caucasian or Asian patients. However, the majority of patients (86.8%) were Caucasian and there 
were fewer than 100 African patients per treatment group. Similarly, the majority of patients were non-
Hispanic (95.4%) and there were fewer than 200 Hispanic patients per treatment group. These small 
numbers of patients precluded an accurate assessment of potential differences by race or ethnicity. 
BMI 
The BMI category with the most patients was 25 to 30 kg/m2. Patients with a BMI >35 kg/m2 had a 
higher frequency of investigator-reported AEs in the DE and warfarin groups compared with the lower 
BMI categories. The overall pattern of AE frequencies by BMI category was mostly similar to those 
reported in the overall assessment of investigator-reported AEs. For all categories of BMI the reported 
overall AE frequencies were always numerically lower for the DE group compared with the warfarin group. 
Further analyses of intrinsic factors for bleedings 
There were generally fewer MBEs reported for patients treated with DE compared with those treated with 
warfarin in the pooled aVTEt studies, across all subgroups of patients. In the pooled aVTEt studies, from 
the start of doubledummy treatment, the incidence of MBEs in DE patients was lower compared with 
warfarin patients for the intrinsic risk factors of all age categories except 80 years or more, creatinine 
clearance categories >50 mL/min (i.e. not severe and moderate renal impairment), patients of non-
Hispanic ethnicity or Asian race, and patients in regions other than Asia and "other", regardless of 
gender.  
Also in the sVTEp Study 1160.47, there were generally fewer MBEs reported for patients treated with DE 
compared with those treated with W. The incidence of MBEs in DE patients was lower compared with 
warfarin patients for most age categories (but not for the age range 65-75 years), creatinine clearance 
categories >50 mL/min (i.e. not severe and moderate renal impairment), and patients of non-Hispanic 
ethnicity and Caucasian race, regardless of gender. 
The Applicant was requested to analyse the influence of a combination of risk factors. The only 
meaningful analysis was the combination of age over 75 years and moderate renal impairment. The 
incidence of bleedings was numerically higher in patients on DE with this combination of risk factors 
compared to patients on DE not having this combination of risk factors. This was particularly true for 
major bleeding events. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
In the VTE program, few patients reported concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in the pooled aVTEt studies 
(DE: 2.2%, W: 1.7%) or in sVTEp Study 1160.47 (DE: 2.8%, W: 2.5%). The most frequently reported P-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 125/146 
  
  
 
 
 
gp inhibitors taken concomitantly with DE were verapamil (1.3% and 1.2%) followed by amiodarone 
(0.3% and 0.8%) in the aVTEt studies and sVTEp Study 1160.47, respectively. 
Overall, a smaller proportion of patients were taking P-gp inhibitors in the VTE studies than in the SPAF 
studies with DE. 
Major bleeding events were reported for no DE patients and 1 (2.7%) warfarin patient who concomitantly 
used a P-gp inhibitor. In 1160.47, major bleeding events were reported for no patients in the DE group 
and 1 patient (3.6%) in the warfarin group who concomitantly used a P-gp inhibitor. The incidence of 
MBEs/CRBEs for patients who took concomitant P-gp inhibitors was lower in DE patients compared to 
warfarin patients in the pooled aVTEt studies and in sVTEp Study 1160.47. Further, DE patients taking 
concomitant P-gp inhibitors did not experience more bleeding events (MBEs or MBEs/CRBEs) than DE 
patients not receiving P-gp inhibitors. 
In the aVTEt studies and in 1160.47, the incidence of any bleeding events was similar between the DE 
and warfarin groups with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors. 
Antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents and NSAIDs 
In the VTE studies, the incidence of bleeding events (MBEs, MBEs/CRBEs, any bleeding) did not generally 
increase in DE-treated patients with co-administration of ASA, NSAIDs, or anticoagulants. The incidence 
of MBEs was lower for DE patients than warfarin patients with concomitant use of ASA, but the difference 
in incidences varied depending on the time of starting to count the bleeding events (from start of any 
treatment vs. double-dummy treatment), with slightly more DE-treated patients than warfarin patients 
having an event with concomitant use of an NSAID, an anticoagulant, or parenteral therapy for the index 
event > 9 days. These subgroups were small as was the number of events. The 2 DE patients in Study 
1160.63 who had MBEs did not use ASA, NSAIDs, or anticoagulants concomitantly. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In general, AEs were the cause of discontinuation in 7-12% in the four pivotal studies. Most common AEs 
causing discontinuation of study drug were related to vascular disorders, respiratory disorders and GI 
disorders.  
In the pooled pivotal studies, discontinuations of study drug due to AEs were more common among DE 
patients (9.6%) compared to warfarin patients (8.8%). The highest frequency was seen among the 
placebo-treated patients (12.3%).  
Overall DVT caused discontinuation in 0.4-1.4% of patients treated with DE and in 1.1-1.3% in patients 
treated with W. PE caused discontinuation in 0.6-1.2% of patients treated with DE compared to 0.2-0.6% 
in patients treated with W. The discontinuation rates due to investigator-reported cardiac disorder AEs 
were low across all treatment groups: 0.6% for DE patients, 0.3% for warfarin and 0.5% for placebo.  
As presented in the tables in the bleeding subsection (in 4.4), discontinuations due to MBEs, MBEs/CRBEs 
and any bleeding were consistently fewer in patients treated with DE compared to patients receiving W. 
In the pooled aVTEt studies, investigator-reported AEs were the cause of discontinuation of study drug in 
8.9% of patients in the DE group vs. 7.8% of patients in the warfarin group. PE led more often to 
discontinuation in patients treated with DE (26 patients; 1.0%) than those receiving warfarin (15 
patients; 0.6%). Investigator-reported AEs of DVT leading to discontinuation occurred at the same rate 
(1.4%) in both treatment groups. More patients treated with DE compared with patients treated with 
warfarin discontinued treatment due to infections and infestations (16 (0.6%) patients and 6 (0.2%) 
patients respectively) and due to blood and lymphatic disorders (9 (0.4%) patients and 2 (0.1%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 126/146 
  
  
 
 
 
respectively). In both treatment groups, discontinuation due to cardiac disorders was infrequent (0.4% in 
both study groups).  
Fewer DE patients than warfarin patients discontinued study drug due to adjudicated bleeding events in 
the pooled aVTEt studies: MBE (0.3% vs. 1.0%), combined MBEs or CRBEs (MBEs/CRBEs) (0.6% vs. 
1.2%), any bleeding (0.7% vs. 1.3%). 
In Study 1160.47, 10.1% of patients treated with DE experienced an investigator-reported AE leading to 
discontinuation of the study drug compared to 8.8% of those receiving W. There was a higher incidence 
of investigator-reported cardiac disorders leading to discontinuation in the DE group (1.0%) than in the 
warfarin group (0.2%) largely resulting from more frequent instances of acute MI, MI, coronary artery 
occlusion, and coronary artery stenosis in the DE treatment group compared to those receiving W. 
Investigator-reported AEs of PE leading to discontinuation were infrequent, but occurred at a higher rate 
in those receiving DE (0.4%) compared to those receiving warfarin (0.1%). There were slightly fewer 
investigator-reported AEs of DVT leading to discontinuation of study drug in patients receiving DE (0.8%) 
compared to those receiving warfarin (1.1%).  
Infections and infestations led to discontinuation in 0.3% and 0.6% of patients treated with DE and 
warfarin respectively. 
Fewer DE patients than warfarin patients discontinued study drug due to adjudicated bleeding events in 
Study 1160.47: MBE (0.3% vs. 1.3%), MBE/CRBE (1.0% vs. 2.5%), any bleeding (1.3% vs. 2.7%). 
When assessed by roll-over status in Study 1160.47, there appeared to be a tendency for patients to be 
more likely to experience an AE leading to discontinuation of the study medication if they were allocated 
to a different treatment in Study 1160.47 (frequencies of 8.3% for the DE→DE treatment sequence 
group, 8.0% for the W→W group, 10.2% for the DE→W group, and 10.9% for the W→DE group). 
In Study 1160.63, more patients in the placebo group (12.3%) discontinued study medication due to AEs 
compared with patients in the DE group (7.3%). Investigator-reported PE and DVT was more often 
leading to discontinuation of study drug in the placebo group (2.9% and 4.9% respectively) compared to 
the DE group (0.1% and 0.4% respectively). For most other AEs leading to discontinuation the incidence 
was comparable between the DE and placebo groups; cardiac disorders caused discontinuation of study 
drug in 0.4% and 0.5% treated with DE and warfarin respectively. 
Discontinuations due to bleeding events were higher in DE patients than P patients: MBE 0.1% vs. 0.0%, 
MBE/CRBE 1.5% vs. 0.6%, and any bleeding 1.8% vs. 0.6%. 
Post marketing experience 
DE (DE) was first authorised on 18 March 2008 in all member states of the European Economic Area 
(EEA) via the centralised procedure. The indication obtained was “Prevention of venous thromboembolic 
events in patients who have undergone major orthopaedic surgery”, and in 2011 the indication of 
“Prevention of stroke, systemic embolism and reduction of vascular mortality in patients with AF” was 
approved in EU.  
Outside Europe, DE is approved in the US and Canada since 2010 and in Japan, Australia, and New 
Zealand since 2011. Overall, marketing authorisation for DE has been received in more than 90 countries 
worldwide.

Source: The Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulation of ADRs from  
post-marketing sources; PSUR #9, cut-off date 18 Mar 2013. 
In general, the most common reported preferred terms ADRs are related to bleedings several of these 
with a potential serious outcome (e.g. GI haemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents). Other common 
reported ARDs are GI-related and general disorders. 
During the reporting period for the last PSUR (PSUR #9, reporting interval of 19 Sep 2012 to 18 Mar 
2013), relevant safety findings were obtained from a subgroup analysis from the RE-LY trial. The findings 
showed that patients with major bleedings on DE were older, had a lower creatinine clearance and more 
frequently used aspirin or non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents than those on W. Though subgroups at 
increased risk are in line with previous knowledge and not unexpected, the results from the study 
confirmed that certain patient categories have an increased risk of major bleeding events when treated 
with DE.  
These findings from clinical trials and a number of post-marketing reports resulted in updates of the 
SmPC including a recommendation that in all patients renal function should be assessed, a more detailed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 128/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
specification of contraindications in section 4.3, and an update of section 4.4 “Special warnings and 
precautions for use”, specifying that use of ASA, clopidogrel or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as 
well as the presence of oesophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux increases the risk of GI 
haemorrhages. Furthermore, with the purpose to include more detailed instruction for prevention of 
clinically relevant bleeding, Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” was also updated to 
include with the information that “Close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is 
recommended throughout the treatment period, especially if risk factors are combined”.   
Due to an imbalance in thromboembolic and total (mainly minor) bleeding events in disfavour of DE in 
the RE-ALIGN trials (1160.113 and 1160.138), several actions were taken including trial discontinuation 
and addition of “prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment” as a new contraindication in 
the EU SmPC. Also a warning that concomitant use of DE and ticagrelor may increase the risk of bleeding 
has been included in the newly updated European SmPC (mechanism: concomitant use of DE and 
ticagrelor increase the AUC of ticagrelor). 
Important identified risks in the RMP include haemorrhage, various gastrointestinal disorders, 
hypersensitivity (including pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions) and off-label 
use in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Furthermore, following a request from the EMA (assessment 
report regarding the submission in the indication SPAF, December 2010), MI has also been classified as 
potential risk in the RMP.  
Overall, the post marketing experience with DE shows that the most commonly reported ADRs are related 
to the GI system, central nervous system and general disorders. Due to the risk of bleedings, especially 
an increased risk of GI bleedings, the European SmPC has been updated to include specific warnings and 
precautions. As the risk of bleedings has been shown to be partly related to decreased kidney function, 
the EU SmPC recommends that kidney function should be monitored in all patients treated with DE. 
Furthermore, “prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment” has been added as a 
contraindication due to an increased risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events. 
For risks that are associated with long-duration exposure and having a high baseline incidence (e.g. 
malignancies and osteoporotic fractures), analyses of individual case safety reports are unlikely to 
provide the necessary information. In the latest PSUR, the MAH is asked to discuss and propose suitable 
additional pharmacovigilance activities that can be applied when potential risks have these 
characteristics. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data is based on four randomised double-blinded active- or placebo-controlled studies. The 
definition for the main safety endpoint, MBEs, followed the recommendations of the International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), and furthermore all bleeding events were centrally adjudicated 
by an independent committee that was blinded with regard to the treatment allocation of patients. 
Adjudicated results were used in the analyses of bleeding events. This is endorsed.  
The choice of analysing all bleeding events from the aVTEt studies with data reported after first intake of 
study drug at the start of oral only treatment (double-dummy treatment) is not considered to produce a 
bias in favour of DE and is therefore supported.  
Many of the provided safety analyses are based on a pooled dataset comprising all four studies. There are 
a number of advantages of including all four studies, but there could also be some drawbacks. The 
patients included in the aVTEt studies may be different from the patients in the sVTEp studies. Further, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 129/146 
  
  
 
 
 
the patients in the two sVTEp studies differ in terms of VTE recurrence risk. However, where relevant, the 
Applicant has also provided pooled analyses of the aVTEt studies and the three W-controlled studies. 
Patient exposure 
In the pooled pivotal studies, 8,132 patients were treated with study drug, of these 4,667 patients were 
treated with DE. Mean treatment duration for the pooled VTE studies was 278 days for DE, 298 days for 
warfarin and 162 days for placebo. The maximum duration of continuous treatment for any patient 
treated with DE was 1,210 days (~40 months). 
Safety data for more than 6 months were available for 2,214 DE patients, 1,670 warfarin patients and 
445 placebo patients. Safety data for more than 12 months were available for 1,043 DE patients, 1,034 
warfarin patients and no placebo patients. 
In general, demographic characteristics were equally distributed across treatment groups, and the 
included patients are considered to be representative for the target patient group. An acceptable amount 
of patients above the age of 75 years are included, likewise the studies also included patients with cardiac 
disorders (approximately 8% of all included patients) and patients with moderate renal impairment (37% 
of the included patients had GFR <80 ml/min).  
It is considered that the number of patients and the extent of exposure fulfil the ICH guidelines. A 
significant number of patients have been exposed to DE in an acceptable timeframe of 6 to 12 months. 
Overall, there were no marked differences in baseline demographics. In Study 1160.47, slightly more 
patients in the DE group had cardiovascular diseases at baseline; however, there was no difference in use 
of cardiovascular medication between the two study groups. 
AEs 
Across all the active-controlled studies, 66-72% of patients treated with DE and 67-72% of patients 
treated with warfarin experienced an AE. Overall, dyspepsia-/gastritis-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea and rectal bleeding were the most commonly reported GI AEs in DE patients and were generally 
(but not exclusively) seen more frequently among patients treated with DE compared to patients treated 
with warfarin and placebo. Other bleeding disorders including conjunctival haemorrhage, epistaxis, 
haemopthysis, haematuria, menorhhagia and haematomas were all seen more often in the warfarin 
group compared with the DE group.  
Pulmonary embolism was reported slightly more frequently in the DE group (1.0%) compared to the 
warfarin group (0.7%).  
Most investigator-reported AEs were mild or moderate in intensity for all treatment groups in all pivotal 
studies. 
Suspected cardiovascular adverse events occurred more often in the active-controlled studies (0.9-2.0% 
in the DE group and 0.6-1.3% in the warfarin group) compared to the placebo-controlled study (0.4% 
and 0.3% in the DE and placebo group respectively). The lower number seen in the placebo-controlled 
study is probably due to the more restrictive inclusion criteria. A more appropriate way of comparing the 
two active treatment groups would be only to include data from the active-controlled studies (studies 
1160.46, 116053 and 1160.47) as including all four pivotal studies might dilute the percentage of 
cardiovascular events in the DE group. The Applicant presented the result of cardiovascular AEs for the 
individual studies and for the pooled active-controlled studies, and the concern was resolved during the 
procedure.

EMA/CHMP/230414/2014

Gastrointestinal adverse events including dyspepsia-/gastritis-like symptoms and rectal bleeding were 
recorded more often in patients receiving DE compared to W. The Applicant was asked to provide data for 
the proportions of the rectal bleedings which presented as passage of fresh blood, melena or presence of 
occult blood in the stool. Further, the Applicant provided information about the reversibility of the GI 
adverse effects, including the proportion of the GERD-like adverse effects and rectal haemorrhages which 
resolved spontaneously and how many patients needed treatment. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
SAEs 
Across the three active-controlled pivotal studies, 11.8-15.9% of patients experienced a serious adverse 
event (SAE) during the treatment period. In all three active-controlled studies, slightly more patients in 
the DE group (12.2-15.9%) experienced an SAE compared to the warfarin group (11.8-15.7%), and in all 
three studies slightly more patients treated with DE (0.7-1.0%) compared to patients treated with 
warfarin (0.4-0.8%) experienced DVT. The same pattern was seen for PE: DE 0.6-1.1% vs. W 0.2-0.9%.   
In the placebo-controlled study, more patients treated with placebo compared to DE (9.1% vs. 6.9%) 
experienced SAEs which is not surprising. The difference was mostly due to more SAEs of DVT and PE in 
the placebo-treated group, indicating a better prophylactic effect of DE compared to placebo.  
In all four pivotal studies, most frequently reported SAEs included gastrointestinal disorders, DVT and PE. 
Bleedings 
Major bleeding events (MBEs) were fewer among DE-treated patients than in patients treated with W, but 
more frequent than in patients on placebo. This pattern of more events in patients receiving warfarin is 
consistent when looking at the pooled data sets and the studies individually.  
There was generally also a higher incidence of MBEs in the warfarin group when breaking down MBEs by 
bleeding criteria or by bleeding location. One exception was intraocular bleedings; however, the number 
of events was low. 
The results are not surprising when considering the results of the RE-LY study in atrial fibrillation patients 
where the 150 mg b.i.d. was tested against W. 
As expected, there were more MBEs on DE than on placebo in the placebo-controlled sVTEp study. 
Clinically relevant bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) followed the pattern seen with MBEs. The hazard ratios 
DE vs. W were statistically significant in each individual study and in the pooled aVTEt dataset. As 
expected, there were more events on DE in the placebo-controlled sVTEp study. 
All bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) also followed the pattern seen with MBEs.  
The incidence of bleedings in the W-treated patients appeared to be dependent on the quality of the INR 
control (Time in Therapeutic Range, TTR). Bleeding events quite clearly occurred more frequently in 
patients with the poorest TTR (<40%). In relation to the overall benefit-risk balance of DE, the Applicant 
addressed the influence on major bleeding events when disregarding poorly managed warfarin patients. 
Analyses suggested that the advantage of DE in terms of major bleeding events was also evident when 
comparing to warfarin-treated patients across other TTR ranges, including patients with TTR levels similar 
to those typically seen in Europe. 
Acute coronary syndrome 
ACS events appear to occur more frequently in DE-treated patients than in patients receiving W.

The topic of a possible causal relation between DE and myocardial infarction has previously been 
extensively reviewed by the CHMP - in particular in variation Pradaxa II-31 which followed a meta-
analysis by Ken Uchino and Adrian V Hernandez (Circulation. 2011; 124: A15500). In the RE-LY study 
supporting the indication in atrial fibrillation patients, a slightly higher rate of myocardial infarction (MI) 
was noted in patients treated with either of the DE doses than in patients treated with W. This finding 
inspired the meta-analysis by Uchino and Hernandez. The objective of the meta-analysis was to 
systematically evaluate the risk of MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the use of DE for several 
indications. Control arms included W, enoxaparin or placebo. The result of the meta-analysis was that DE 
was significantly associated with a higher risk for MI or ACS than the control group (DE 1.23% vs. control 
0.88%; OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67). As a response, the Applicant provided an extensive review and 
conducted its own meta-analysis which addressed some of the weaknesses of the Uchino and Hernandez 
meta-analysis. This meta-analysis included all the studies included in the current application. It showed 
that from randomization to study termination, the odds ratios (OR) for MI (95% CI) were 1.30 (0.96, 
1.76) and 1.42 (1.07, 1.88), for DE 110 mg b.i.d. and 150 mg b.i.d., compared to W, respectively. The 
odds ratios (OR) for MI (95% CI) were 1.07 (0.36, 3.20) and 1.37 (0.50, 3.70), for DE 110 mg b.i.d. or 
150 mg b.i.d., compared to placebo, respectively. When looking at the studies with warfarin as a 
comparator individually and from the meta-analysis, it appeared to be a consistent and relatively robust 
finding that the incidence of MI in patients treated with DE was higher than in patients treated with W. 
The absolute differences were small, and it was agreed by the CHMP that the difference was 
counterbalanced by DE’s beneficial effects in terms of stroke reduction and lower observed rates of CV 
mortality and overall mortality by a solid margin. It was not finally established whether the difference in 
MI rates between DE and warfarin represent a true adverse effect of DE or is caused by a protective 
effect of warfarin (or both). 
The current application has not provided much new information about the topic. However, given the 
efficacy results in the aVTEt and sVTEp indications where warfarin consistently performed better than DE 
(in contrast to the SPAF population), the results on ACS have implications for the benefit-risk balance in 
these indications. To further address these implications, the Applicant provided an analysis using a 
composite cardiovascular endpoint consisting of non-fatal recurrent VTE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
non-fatal systemic embolism and all-cause death. In all three warfarin-controlled studies, there was a 
higher incidence in patients on DE compared to warfarin-treated patients although the hazard ratio was 
close to and not statistically significantly different from 1. 
Deaths 
The frequency of deaths was slightly higher in the warfarin group compared to the DE group. No 
remarkable differences in the pattern of adverse events leading to death are noted.  
Patients switching treatment when “rolling over” to Study 1160.47 had a higher mortality than patients 
who stayed on the same treatment.  
Laboratory findings 
Liver function tests: 
Overall the mean changes from baseline were small and without any clinically relevant difference between 
treatment groups in all four pivotal studies. For ALT, AST and ALP the changes were higher in the DE and 
warfarin groups compared with the placebo group. For all liver parameters, no clinically relevant 
difference between DE and warfarin was seen for transitions to above the reference range from baseline 
to the last on-treatment value and to the worst on-treatment value. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 132/146 
  
  
 
 
 
No relevant differences in the frequencies of possible clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) between 
the treatment groups were observed for any of the four liver function parameters in any of the four 
pivotal studies. In all four studies, the PCSAs were most frequently reported for ALT, followed by AST. 
PCSAs were in general seen in less than 2.5% within each treatment group and liver function test, more 
often among patients treated with DE and warfarin compared with patients treated with placebo. There 
was no clinically relevant difference in the frequency of PCSAs between the DE and the warfarin group. 
Only few cases of abnormal laboratory liver function parameters were reported as adverse events; most 
commonly increase in ALT or AST. The numbers of cases where the AEs were leading to study drug 
discontinuation or reported as SAEs are too few to draw any conclusion. However, there was no indication 
of differences between treatment groups. 
The results of the liver function parameters of DE treated patients in the four pivotal studies are in line 
with results from previous studies and post marketing experiences with the same dose as applied for. In 
general, slightly more elevated liver function parameters were seen in the DE and the warfarin groups 
compared with the placebo group. However, no clinically relevant differences in liver function parameters 
were seen between DE and W. Results from the studies do not indicate any hepatotoxicity. 
Other laboratory parameters: 
There were no clinically relevant important differences in median haematology, electrolyte, creatinine, 
and urea values between the DE and warfarin groups. Changes in the median values from baseline to the 
last on-treatment value and to the worst on-treatment value were generally small and did not show any 
clinically important differences between the DE and warfarin groups. Decrease in haematocrit was the 
most often reported possible clinically significant abnormality and was reported in up to 4.4% in patients 
treated with DE and up to 4.9% of patients treated with W. This adverse event is likely (partly) to be 
related to bleedings during the treatments, and anaemia is already mentioned as a common possible 
adverse event in the SmPC. Increase in creatinine was reported with a similar incidence in the DE and the 
warfarin treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
In the aVTEt studies, in patients with moderate renal impairment, MBEs and MBEs/CRBEs were more 
frequent in the DE treatment group than in the warfarin group. However, this was not seen in the W-
controlled sVTEp study (1160.47). 
Generally, the bleeding risk increased with age, and the relative advantage of DE compared to warfarin 
generally diminished with age – with a few exceptions for some categories where patient numbers were 
low.  
Only one dose (150 mg BID) was investigated in the aVTEt and sVTEp studies. However, the MAH was 
requested to discuss and reconsider the posology in special populations with regard to age, kidney 
function and P-gp inhibition. The number of patients of high age, patients with moderate renal 
impairment or receiving P-gp inhibitors in the pivotal studies was limited and did not allow firm 
conclusions based on clinical outcome, but pharmacokinetic considerations indicated that a lower dose 
may be more appropriate in some subgroups. The MAH subsequently proposed a posology identical to 
that of the SPAF indication. i.e. recommendation of a reduced dose (daily dose of 220 mg taken as two 
110 mg capsules) for patients aged 80 years or above and for patients who receive concomitant 
verapamil, as well as recommendations to consider this dose for other subgroups.

The number of patients taking P-gp inhibitors in the VTE studies is lower than in the RE-LY study. 
Considering the differences in the study populations and the fact that a number of antiarrythmic agents 
are P-gp inhibitors, this is expected. 
Even if the concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors was not associated with an increased bleeding risk 
compared to W, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions because of the low number of patients taking P-gp 
inhibitors. 
Generally, there were fewer bleedings with DE than with warfarin in patients concomitantly using 
antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents and NSAIDs. However, in the aVTEt studies, MBEs were slightly 
more frequent in the DE group than in the warfarin group in patients receiving concomitant NSAID. But 
the number of events was very small. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
In both the pooled pivotal studies, the pooled aVTEt studies and the active-controlled prevention Study 
1160.47, discontinuations due to AEs occurred slightly more frequently in the DE groups (7.8–10.1%) 
compared to the warfarin groups (6.8%–8.8%). In the placebo-controlled sVTEp study, more patients in 
the placebo group (12.3%) compared with the DE group (7.3%) discontinued treatment. AEs that 
resulted in discontinuation of treatment mirrored the types of SAEs that were reported most frequently in 
this study: vascular disorders, respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal disorders.  
Discontinuations due to MBEs, MBEs/CRBEs and any bleeding were consistently fewer in patients treated 
with DE compared to patients receiving W. 
Both in the pooled pivotal studies, the pooled aVTEt studies and the active-controlled prevention Study 
1160.47, PE leading to discontinuation was reported more often in the DE group compared with the 
warfarin group. This is in accordance with the overall findings of (S)AEs, where PE was reported more 
often in patients treated with DE compared with W. There was no significant difference in percentage of 
DVT leading to discontinuation between the two active treatment groups. Results of recurrence of VTE are 
discussed in the efficacy section. 
In the pooled aVTEt studies, more patients treated with DE compared with patients treated with warfarin 
discontinued treatment due to infections and infestations and due to blood and lymphatic disorders. The 
Applicant provided on request additional information about the nature of the infections and infestations 
leading to discontinuation among the DE treated patients and likewise more information about the blood 
and lymphatic disorders that caused discontinuation of study drug.   
In the active-controlled long-term Study 1160.47, there was a higher incidence of investigator-reported 
cardiac disorders leading to discontinuation of study medication in the DE group (1.0%) compared to the 
warfarin group (0.2%), largely resulting from more frequent instances of acute MI, MI, coronary artery 
occlusion, and coronary artery stenosis, in the DE treatment group compared to those receiving W. This 
was not observed in the short-term aVTEt studies.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety results from the aVTEt and sVTEp clinical development programme are very much in line with 
the experience from the atrial fibrillation indication. The bleeding risks with the 150 mg b.i.d. dose are 
less than observed with W. However, the difference in bleeding risk appear to diminish in certain 
subpopulations and when comparing to patients who are reasonably well managed on warfarin in terms of 
INR control. Events of acute coronary syndrome appear to occur more frequently in DE-treated patients 
than in patients receiving W, although absolute numbers are low. This excess has to be factored into the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 134/146 
  
  
 
 
 
benefit-risk balance. Gastrointestinal adverse events occur more frequently with DE than with W. 
However, in contrast to the RE-LY study (supporting the SPAF indication), major GI bleedings were not 
more frequent in DE patients compared to warfarin patients. 
No major objections relating specifically to safety have been identified, but the excess of acute coronary 
events has to be factored into the benefit-risk balance.  
The MAH accepted dose recommendations for the aVTEt and sVTEp identical to those of the SPAF 
indication. This was accepted by the CHMP.

Proposed 
• 
• 
Treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and 
prevention of related death 
Prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE and related death 
is acceptable provided that the MAH answerers sufficient to the LoQ raised. 
The MAH has sufficiently responded to the list of questions raised and the RMP is approved.  
In the next RMP update the MAH should clarify a remaining minor issue and follow the suggestion in 
relation to Q18 (In a clinical trial the rate of heart attacks with DE was numerically higher than with W. 
The overall occurrence was low. The wording of the second sentence is not optimal and might be changed 
to “In a clinical trial the rate of heart attacks was numerically higher in the group treated with DE than in 
the group treated with Warfarin.”) and also revise the category from 1 to 3 for the following studies since 
none of them are in fact included in the Annex II: 1160.136 GLORIA –AF, 1160.130, 1160.139.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC considers that no additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary for the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product. 
 Pharmacovigilance Plan 
The PRAC considers that the existing obligations in the MA are sufficient. 
The CHMP has endorsed the PRAC advice without changes 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a consequence of the new indications, sections 4.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC for the 75 mg strength, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC for the 110 mg and 150 strengths have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. A large number of further requests 
for modifications of the SmPC have been made by the CHMP. Please refer to the annotated Product 
Information included in Annex 1.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy of dabigatran etexilate (DE) in the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or 
pulmonary embolism (PE) has been documented in two replicate, warfarin-controlled 6-months studies 
(RE-COVER and RE-COVER II). In both studies non-inferiority was formally shown against the pre-set 
non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint (recurrent symptomatic VTE and deaths related to VTE). 
Numerically, warfarin was superior to DE in both studies and hence also in the pooled analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 141/146 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The efficacy of DE in the prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism 
(PE) was documented in a long-term warfarin-controlled study (RE-MEDY) and a 6-month placebo-
controlled study (RE-SONATE). In the latter study, the baseline risk of VTE was significantly lower than in 
the former study. Non-inferiority was formally shown against the pre-set non-inferiority margin in the RE-
MEDY study for the primary endpoint (recurrent symptomatic VTE and deaths related to VTE) although 
warfarin was numerically superior to DE. In the RE-SONATE study, DE was clearly superior to placebo. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The uncertainty with regard to the suboptimal warfarin treatment in all three warfarin-controlled studies 
and its impact on the efficacy evaluation of DE has largely and to a satisfactory extent been resolved. The 
efficacy of warfarin in the studies did not appear to depend on the Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR).  
There was uncertainty about the efficacy of DE. While the aVTEt studies showed comparable (although 
numerically inferior) efficacy to W, the RE-MEDY study suggested that when using the hazard ratio as 
basis for the calculation up to about half of the effect of warfarin may have been lost with DE. However, 
when using the risk difference as basis for the calculation, about 85% of the effect of warfarin was 
preserved. The Applicant argued that because of the low number of events in the RE-MEDY study, the 
latter was a more appropriate calculation. The CHMP agreed that the absolute difference between DE and 
warfarin in the RE-MEDY study was small. Looking at the results of the RE-MEDY study in the perspective 
of the aVTEt studies and the lack of a plausible explanation as to why the efficacy of DE compared to 
warfarin would be less in the prevention setting than in the acute setting as well as the convincing 
placebo-controlled prevention study (RE-SONATE), the CHMP considered that the efficacy also for the 
prevention indication was acceptable – also in light of the advantages in terms of bleedings (see later). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The risk profile of DE in the aVTEt and sVTEp clinical development programme is consistent with the 
profile in the atrial fibrillation indication. The bleeding risk profile with DE was generally favourable 
compared to W. However, in the aVTEt studies, in patients with moderate renal impairment, MBEs and 
MBEs/CRBEs were more frequent with DE than in the warfarin group. Further, the relative advantage of 
DE compared to warfarin generally diminished with age. The posology in subgroups of patients with high 
age, patients with moderate renal impairment and patients receiving P-gp inhibitors was challenged, and 
the MAH accepted to align the dose recommendations for the aVTEt and sVTEp indications with those of 
the atrial fibrillation indication. This was accepted by the CHMP and will entail a lower dose (110 mg BID) 
for patients aged 80 years and over and patients treated with verapamil, and this lower dose should also 
be considered for other subgroups, e.g. patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Events of acute coronary syndrome appear to occur more frequently in DE-treated patients than in 
patients receiving W, although absolute numbers are low. This is consistent with experience from the 
atrial fibrillation indication. 
Also in line with previous experience, gastrointestinal adverse events occur more frequently with DE than 
with W.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The uncertainty with regard to the suboptimal quality of the warfarin treatment in the active-controlled 
studies and its impact on the advantage of DE over warfarin in terms of bleedings has been resolved to a 
satisfactory extent. Analyses show that poorly managed patients on warfarin (TTR<40%) had more major 
bleedings than other warfarin patients. However, analyses suggested that the advantage of DE in terms 
of major bleeding events was also evident when comparing to warfarin-treated patients with TTR levels 
similar to those typically seen in Europe. 
It remains uncertain whether the difference in rates of acute coronary syndrome between DE and 
warfarin represents a real adverse effect associated with the use of DE or it is caused by a protective 
effect of warfarin. This uncertainty was however considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Besides, the optimal dose for patients with renal impairment, high age and/or concomitant treatment with 
P-gp inhibitors is still uncertain. Given the alignment with the posology of the SPAF indication, this was 
also considered as acceptable by the CHMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In all warfarin-controlled studies (both aVTEt studies and one sVTEp study), non-inferiority was shown. 
Warfarin was nominally superior to DE in all studies, but the absolute differences were small. 
In the placebo-controlled prevention study, DE was statistically and clinically clearly superior to placebo. 
The efficacy of DE in both aVTEt and sVTEp is considered clinically relevant, robust and generally on par 
with warfarin. 
Overall, the differences in bleeding risk between DE and warfarin are considered to be clinically 
significant. The differences appear smaller when disregarding poorly managed warfarin patients. For 
patients with renal impairment and to some extent with high age, the differences with the tested dose 
(150 mg BID) do not seem clinically relevant. 
The absolute increase in acute coronary syndrome events observed with DE compared to warfarin is small 
and was not observed in the comparison to placebo, but given the nature of these events still important. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Non-inferiority was shown in the warfarin-controlled studies, although DE was nominally inferior all three 
studies. However, overall the efficacy of DE is considered comparable to that of warfarin.  
The advantages of DE over warfarin with regard to bleedings are evident from the results, also when 
disregarding poorly managed warfarin patients.  
The excess of events of acute coronary syndrome observed with DE compared to warfarin (but not to 
placebo) is considered to be important, but the number of the events was low and should be seen in the 
context of the advantages in terms of major bleedings. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of DE in the aVTEt and sVTEp indications is considered comparable to that of warfarin, even 
though it may be marginally less. However, this should be seen in the perspective of the advantages in 
terms of major bleedings and other bleeding events. The excess of acute coronary syndrome with DE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/230414/2014 
Page 143/146 
 
  
  
 
 
 
compared to warfarin (but not to placebo) is small and is not considered to outweigh the advantages 
associated with DE. 
Consequently, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive in the aVTEt and sVTEp indications.  
4.  Overall conclusion 
Based on the review of the data on clinical efficacy and safety, the CHMP consider that the application 
for DE in aVTEt and sVTEp is approvable.  
An important other concern related to dose recommendations for patients with renal impairment, high 
age and/or concomitant treatment with P-gp inhibitors as well as other remaining issues concerning the 
SmPC were satisfactorily resolved by the MAH during the procedure. 
5.  Recommendations

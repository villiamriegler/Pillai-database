CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Empliciti is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of 
multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (see sections 4.2 
and 5.1). 
Empliciti is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior 
therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease 
progression on the last therapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Elotuzumab therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of 
multiple myeloma. 
Premedication for prevention of infusion related reactions (IRRs) 
Patients must be administered with the following premedications 45-90 minutes prior to Empliciti 
infusion (see section 4.4): 
 
 
 
 
Dexamethasone 8 mg intravenous 
H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25-50 mg orally or intravenous) or equivalent H1 blocker. 
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg intravenous or 150 mg orally) or equivalent H2 blocker. 
Paracetamol (650-1000 mg orally). 
Management of IRRs 
If a ≥ Grade 2 IRR occurs during Empliciti administration, the infusion must be interrupted. Upon 
resolution to ≤ Grade 1, Empliciti should be restarted at 0.5 mL/min and may be gradually increased at 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a rate of 0.5 mL/min every 30 minutes as tolerated to the rate at which the IRR occurred. If there is no 
recurrence of the IRR, the escalation can be resumed (see Tables 3 and 4). 
In patients who experience an IRR, vital signs should be monitored every 30 minutes for 2 hours after 
the end of the Empliciti infusion. If the IRR recurs, the Empliciti infusion must be stopped and not 
restarted on that day (see section 4.4). Very severe IRRs (≥ Grade 3) may require permanent 
discontinuation of Empliciti therapy and emergency treatment. 
Posology for administration with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
The length of each treatment cycle is 28 days, see Table 1 for the dosing schedule. 
Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The recommended dose of Empliciti is 10 mg/kg body weight (bw) administered intravenously every 
week, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for the first two treatment cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter on 
days 1 and 15. 
The recommended dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day 
cycles, and at least 2 hours after Empliciti infusion when administered on the same day. 
The administration of dexamethasone is as follows: 
 
On days that Empliciti is administered, dexamethasone should be given as 28 mg orally once 
daily between 3 and 24 hours before Empliciti plus 8 mg intravenously between 45 and 
90 minutes before Empliciti on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles. 
On days that Empliciti is not administered but a dose of dexamethasone is scheduled (Days 8 
and 22 of cycle 3 and all subsequent cycles), dexamethasone should be given 40 mg orally.

See Method of administration below for instruction on infusion rates. 
Dose delay, interruption, or discontinuation 
If the dose of one medicine in the regimen is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued, the treatment with 
the other medicinal products may continue as scheduled. However, if oral or intravenous 
dexamethasone is delayed or discontinued, the administration of Empliciti should be based on clinical 
judgment (e.g. risk of hypersensitivity) (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required for Empliciti in patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2). Data on 
the efficacy and safety of Empliciti in patients ≥ 85 years of age are very limited. The dose for 
dexamethasone in combination with pomalidomide is adjusted according to age. See Administration of 
dexamethasone for adults ≤ 75 years old and for > 75 years old above. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Empliciti is required for patients with mild (creatinine clearance 
(CrCl) = 60 - 89 mL/min), moderate (CrCl = 30 - 59 mL/min), severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment for Empliciti is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
(TB) ≤ to the upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or 
TB < 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST). Empliciti has not been studied in patients with moderate 
(TB > 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST) or severe (TB > 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2).

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Empliciti in the paediatric population for the indication of multiple 
myeloma. 
Method of administration 
Empliciti is for intravenous use only. 
Infusion rate for Empliciti 10 mg/kg bw 
The administration of the reconstituted and diluted solution must be initiated at an infusion rate of 
0.5 mL/min. If the infusion is well tolerated the infusion rate may be increased in a stepwise fashion as 
described in Table 3. The maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
The Summary of Product Characteristics for lenalidomide, pomalidomide and dexamethasone used in 
combination with Empliciti must be consulted before starting therapy. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
IRRs 
IRRs have been reported in patients receiving elotuzumab (see section 4.8). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Premedication consisting of dexamethasone, H1 blocker, H2 blocker, and paracetamol must be 
administered prior to Empliciti infusion (see section 4.2 Premedication). The rate of IRRs was much 
higher in patients who were not premedicated. 
If any of the symptoms of IRR reach Grade ≥ 2, Empliciti infusion must be interrupted and appropriate 
medical and supportive measures instituted. Vital signs should be monitored every 30 minutes for 
2 hours after the end of the Empliciti infusion. Once the reaction has resolved (symptoms ≤ Grade 1), 
Empliciti can be restarted at the initial infusion rate of 0.5 mL/min. If symptoms do not recur, the 
infusion rate may be gradually escalated every 30 minutes to a maximum of 5 mL/min (see section 4.2 
Method of administration). 
Very severe IRRs may require permanent discontinuation of Empliciti therapy and emergency 
treatment. Patients with mild or moderate IRRs may receive Empliciti with a reduced infusion rate and 
close monitoring (see section 4.2 Method of administration). 
Conditions for use of medicinal products used with Empliciti 
Empliciti is used in combination with other medicinal products; therefore, the conditions for use 
applicable to those medicinal products also apply to the combination therapy. The Summary of 
Product Characteristics for all medicinal products used in combination with Empliciti must be 
consulted before starting therapy. 
Infections 
In clinical trials of patients with multiple myeloma, the incidence of all infections, including 
pneumonia, were higher in patients treated with Empliciti (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored and infections should be managed with standard treatment. 
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) 
In a clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma that compared Empliciti combined with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment to lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment 
(CA204004), the incidence of SPMs, and specifically of solid tumours and non-melanoma skin cancer, 
was higher in patient treated with Empliciti (see section 4.8). SPMs are known to be associated with 
lenalidomide exposure, which was extended in patients treated with Empliciti combined with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone vs. lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The rate of haematologic 
malignancies was the same between the two treatment arms. Patients should be monitored for the 
development of SPMs. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 3.92 mg sodium per 300 mg vial or 5.23 mg sodium per 400 mg vial, 
which is equivalent to 0.2% or 0.3% respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake 
of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not been conducted. Empliciti, as a humanised monoclonal 
antibody, is not expected to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug 
metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal 
products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of Empliciti. 
Empliciti may be detected in the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum immunofixation 
assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response classification. The presence of 
elotuzumab in patient's serum may cause a small peak in the early gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ 
on serum immunofixation. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and 
possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. 
In case of detection of additional peaks on serum immunofixation, the possibility of a biclonal 
gammopathy should be excluded.

The Summary of Product Characteristics for lenalidomide, pomalidomide and dexamethasone used in 
combination with Empliciti must be consulted before starting therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Woman of childbearing potential/Contraception in the males and females 
Empliciti should not be used in women of childbearing potential, unless the clinical condition of the 
woman requires treatment with elotuzumab. Women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception during and for 120 days following treatment. 
Male patients must use effective contraception measures during and for 180 days following treatment 
if their partner is pregnant or of childbearing potential and not using effective contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There is no human experience with elotuzumab during pregnancy. Elotuzumab will be given in 
combination with lenalidomide, which is contraindicated during pregnancy. No animal data are 
present regarding the effect on reproductive toxicity because of the lack of an adequate animal model. 
Empliciti should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with elotuzumab. 
The Summary of Product Characteristics for all medicinal products used in combination with 
Empliciti must be consulted before starting therapy. When Empliciti is used with lenalidomide or 
pomalidomide there is a risk of foetal harm, including severe life-threatening human birth defects 
associated with these agents and the need to follow requirements regarding pregnancy avoidance, 
including testing and contraception. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are present in the blood and 
sperm of patients receiving the medicine. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
requirements regarding contraception due to presence and transmission in sperm and for additional 
detail. Patients receiving Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide should adhere 
to the pregnancy prevention programme of lenalidomide or pomalidomide respectively. 
Breast-feeding 
Elotuzumab is not expected to be excreted into human milk. Elotuzumab will be given in combination 
with lenalidomide or pomalidomide and breast-feeding should be stopped because of the use of 
lenalidomide or pomalidomide. 
Fertility 
Studies to evaluate the effect of elotuzumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of 
elotuzumab on male and female fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
On the basis of reported adverse reactions, Empliciti is not expected to influence the ability to drive or 
use machines. Patients experiencing IRRs should be advised not to drive and use machines until 
symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety data of elotuzumab have been assessed from a total of 682 patients with multiple myeloma 
treated with elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (451 patients), 
bortezomib and dexamethasone (103 patients) or pomalidomide and dexamethasone (128 patients) 
pooled across 8 clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). 
The most serious adverse reaction that may occur during elotuzumab treatment is pneumonia. 
The most common adverse reactions (occurring in > 10% of patients) with elotuzumab treatment were 
IRRs, diarrhoea, herpes zoster, nasopharyngitis, cough, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
lymphopenia and weight decreased.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
IRRs 
In the clinical trials of patients with multiple myeloma IRRs were reported in approximately 10% of 
premedicated patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
(N = 318) and 3% of premedicated patients treated with Empliciti combined with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (N = 60) (see section 4.4). The rate of mild to moderate IRRs was > 50% in patients 
who were not premedicated. All reports of IRR were ≤ Grade 3. Grade 3 IRRs occurred in 1% of 
patients. In study CA204004, the most common symptoms of an IRR included fever, chills, and 
hypertension. Five percent (5%) of patients required interruption of the administration of Empliciti for 
a median of 25 minutes due to IRR, and 1% of patients discontinued due to IRRs. Of the patients who 
experienced an IRR, 70% (23/33) had the reaction during the first dose. In study CA204125, all of the 
reported IRRs occurred during the first treatment cycle and were ≤ Grade 2. 
Infections 
The incidence of infections, including pneumonia, was higher with Empliciti treatment than with 
control (see section 4.4). In a clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma (CA204004), infections 
were reported in 81.4% of patients in the Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
arm (N = 318) and 74.4% in lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm (N = 317). Grade 3-4 infections 
were noted in 28% and 24.3% of Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients, respectively. Fatal infections were infrequent and 
were reported in 2.5% of Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and 2.2% of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients. The incidence of pneumonia was higher in the 
Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm compared to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone arm reported at 15.1% vs. 11.7% with a fatal outcome at 0.6% vs. 0%, respectively. 
In a clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma (CA204125), infections were reported in 65% of 
patients in the Empliciti combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone arm (N = 60) and 65.5% in 
the pomalidomide and dexamethasone arm (N = 55). Grade 3-4 infections were noted in 13.3% and 
21.8% of Empliciti combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone treated patients, respectively. Fatal infections (i.e. Grade 5 infections) were reported in 
5% of Empliciti combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and 3.6% of pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone treated patients. 
SPMs 
The incidence of SPMs was higher with Empliciti treatment than with control (see section 4.4). In the 
clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma (CA204004), invasive SPMs have been observed in 
6.9% of patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 318) and 
4.1% of patients treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 317). SPMs are known to be 
associated with lenalidomide exposure which was extended in patients treated with Empliciti 
combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone vs. lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The rate of 
haematologic malignancies were the same between the two treatment arms (1.6%). Solid tumours 
were reported in 2.5% and 1.9% of Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients, respectively. Non-melanoma skin cancer was 
reported in 3.1% and 1.6% of patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone and lenalidomide and dexamethasone, respectively. 
There were no SPM events reported in patients treated in the Empliciti combined with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone study arm (N = 60) and 1 (1.8%) in patients treated in the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone arm (N = 55) in study CA204125. 
Deep vein thrombosis 
In a clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma (CA204004), deep vein thromboses were reported 
in 7.2% of patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 318) 
and 3.8% of patients treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 317). Among, patients treated 
with aspirin, deep vein thromboses were reported in 4.1% of patients treated with Empliciti combined 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Ld) and 1.4% of patients treated with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (Ld). The rates of deep vein thromboses observed between treatment arms were 
similar for patients given prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (2.2% in both treatment 
arms), and for patients given vitamin K antagonists the rates were 0% for patients treated with E-Ld 
and 6.7% for patients treated with Ld. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity to Empliciti. 
Of 390 patients across four clinical trials who were treated with Empliciti and evaluable for the 
presence of anti-product antibodies, 72 patients (18.5%) tested positive for treatment-emergent 
anti-product antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Neutralizing antibodies were 
detected in 19 of 299 patients in CA204004. In the majority of patients, immunogenicity occurred 
early in treatment and was transient resolving by 2 to 4 months. There was no clear causal evidence of 
altered pharmacokinetic, efficacy, or toxicity profiles with anti-product antibody development based 
on the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses. 
Of the 53 patients in CA204125 treated with Empliciti and evaluable for the presence of anti-product 
antibodies, 19 patients (36%) tested positive, of whom 1 patient tested persistent positive, for 
treatment-emergent anti-product antibodies by an ECL assay. In these 19 patients, anti-product 
antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of Empliciti treatment. Anti-product 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibodies resolved by 2 to 3 months in 18 (95%) of these 19 patients. Neutralizing antibodies were 
detected in 2 of 53 patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
One patient was reported to be overdosed with 23.3 mg/kg bw of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The patient had no symptoms, did not require any treatment for the 
overdose, and was able to continue on elotuzumab therapy. 
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody drug 
conjugates, other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates. ATC code: L01FX08. 
Mechanism of action 
Elotuzumab is an immunostimulatory humanised, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets 
the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 7 (SLAMF7) protein. SLAMF7 is 
highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. SLAMF7 is 
also expressed on natural killer cells (NK), normal plasma cells, and other immune cells including 
some T cell subsets, monocytes, B cells, macrophages, and pDCs (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), but is 
not detected on normal solid tissues or haematopoietic stem cells. 
Elotuzumab directly activates natural killer cells through both the SLAMF7 pathway and Fc receptors 
enhancing anti-myeloma activity in vitro. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and 
through interactions with Fc receptors on specific immune cells, promotes the killing of myeloma cells 
through NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
macrophage-mediated antibody-dependant cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In nonclinical models, 
elotuzumab has demonstrated synergistic activity when combined with lenalidomide, pomalidomide or 
bortezomib. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CA204004) 
CA204004 is a randomised, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Ld) in patients with multiple 
myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. All patients had documented progression 
following their most recent therapy. Patients who were refractory to lenalidomide were excluded and 
6% of patients had prior lenalidomide treatment. Patients had to recover after transplant for a 
minimum of 12 weeks from autologous stem cell transplant (SCT), and 16 weeks from allogeneic 
SCT. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis or plasma cell leukemia were excluded from this study. 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Empliciti in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Ld). Treatment was 
administered in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Elotuzumab 
10 mg/kg bw was administered intravenously each week for the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks 
thereafter. Prior to Empliciti infusion, dexamethasone was administered as a divided dose: an oral dose 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 28 mg and an intravenous dose of 8 mg. In the control group and on weeks without Empliciti, 
dexamethasone 40 mg was administered as a single oral dose weekly. Lenalidomide 25 mg was taken 
orally once daily for the first 3 weeks of each cycle. Assessment of tumour response was conducted 
every 4 weeks. 
A total of 646 patients were randomised to receive treatment: 321 to Empliciti in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone and 325 to lenalidomide and dexamethasone. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. The median 
age was 66 years (range 37 to 91); 57% of patients were older than 65 years; 60% of patients were 
male; Whites comprised 84% of the study population, Asians 10%, and blacks 4%. The International 
Staging System (ISS) Stage was I in 43%, II in 32% and III in 21% of patients. The high risk 
cytogenetic categories of del17p and t(4;14) were present in 32% and 9% of patients, respectively. The 
median number of prior therapies was 2. Thirty-five percent (35%) of patients were refractory 
(progression during or within 60 days of last therapy) and 65% were relapsed (progression after 
60 days of last therapy). Prior therapies included: stem cell transplant (55%), bortezomib (70%) 
melphalan (65%), thalidomide (48%), and lenalidomide (6%). 
The primary endpoints of this study, progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by hazard ratio, and 
overall response rate (ORR) were determined based on assessments made by a blinded Independent 
Review Committee (IRC). Efficacy results are presented in Table 8 and Figure 1. The median number 
of treatment cycles was 19 for the Empliciti arm and 14 for the comparator arm. 
Overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint with the pre-planned final OS analysis to occur after 
at least 427 deaths.

The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year rates of overall survival for Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone treatment were 91%, 73%, 60%, 50% and 40% respectively, compared with 83%, 
69%, 53%, 43% and 33% respectively, for lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment (See Figure 2). 
The pre-planned final OS analysis was performed after 212 deaths in the E-Ld arm and 225 deaths in 
the Ld arm. The minimum follow-up was 70.6 months. A statistically significant advantage in OS was 
observed in patients in the E-Ld arm compared to patients in the Ld arm. The median OS in the E-Ld 
arm was 48.30 months compared with 39.62 months in the Ld arm. Patients in the E-Ld arm had an 
18% reduction in the risk of death compared with those in the Ld arm (HR = 0.82; 95.4% CI: 0.68, 
1.00; p-value = 0.0408). See Table 8 and Figure 2.

Empliciti in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (CA204125) 
CA204125 is a randomised, open-label study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
Empliciti in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Pd) in patients with refractory or 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including 
lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and had disease progression on or within 60 days of their 
last therapy. Patients were refractory if they had progressed on or within 60 days of treatment with 
lenalidomide and a PI and on or within 60 days of their last treatment, or relapsed and refractory if 
they had achieved at least a partial response to previous treatment with lenalidomide and a PI but 
progressed within 6 months and had developed progressive disease on or within 60 days after 
completing their last treatment. Patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy were excluded 
from the clinical trials with E-Pd. 
A total of 117 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment: 60 to elotuzumab in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Pd) and 57 to pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (Pd). Treatment was administered in 4-week cycles (28-day cycle) until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Elotuzumab 10 mg/kg bw was administered intravenously each 
week for the first 2 cycles and 20 mg/kg bw every 4 weeks thereafter. 
Dexamethasone was administered on day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. On weeks with Empliciti 
infusion, dexamethasone was administered before Empliciti as a divided dose: subjects ≤ 75 years an 
oral dose of 28 mg and an intravenous dose of 8 mg, and in subjects > 75 years an oral dose of 8 mg 
and an intravenous dose of 8 mg. On weeks without an Empliciti infusion and in the control group, 
dexamethasone was administered in subjects ≤ 75 years as an oral dose of 40 mg and in subjects 
> 75 years as an oral dose of 20 mg dexamethasone. Assessment of tumour response was conducted 
every 4 weeks. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. The median age 
was 67 years (range 36 to 81); 62% of patients were older than 65 years; 57% of patients were male; 
whites comprised 77% of the study population, Asians 21%, and blacks 1%. The International Staging 
System (ISS) Stage was I in 50%, II in 38% and III in 12% of patients. The chromosomal 
abnormalities as determined by the FISH of del(17p), t(4;14) and t(14;16) were present in 5%, 11% 
and 7% of patients, respectively. Eleven (9.4%) patients had high-risk myeloma. The median number 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of prior therapies was 3. Eighty-seven percent (87%) of the patients were refractory to lenalidomide, 
80% refractory to a PI and 70% were refractory to both lenalidomide and a PI. Prior therapies included 
stem cell transplant (55%), bortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (99%), cyclophosphamide (66%), 
melphalan (63%), carfilzomib (21%), ixazomib (6%), and daratumumab (3%). 
The median number of treatment cycles was 9 for the E-Pd arm and 5 for the Pd arm. 
The primary endpoint was investigator assessed PFS by modified International Myeloma Working 
Group (IMWG) criteria. The median PFS per ITT was 10.25 months (95% CI: 5.59, non-estimable 
(NE)) in the E-Pd arm and 4.67 months (95% CI: 2.83, 7.16) in the Pd arm. PFS and ORR were also 
assessed by the IRC. 
PFS results per the investigator and IRC are summarised in Table 10 (minimum follow-up of 
9.1 months). Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS per the investigator is provided in Figure 3.

PFS ITT assessment per investigator was evaluated in several subgroups including age (< 65 versus 
≥ 65), race, ISS stage, prior therapies, transplant, risk category, ECOG status, creatinine clearance, and 
cytogenic abnormalities. Regardless of the subgroup evaluated, PFS was generally consistent with that 
observed in the ITT population for the treatment groups. However, results should be taken with 
caution as assessment of consistency of effect within the different subgroups was hampered by the 
very limited number of patients included in the different subgroups. 
Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary study endpoint. A pre-planned final OS analysis was 
performed after at least 78 deaths occurred. The minimum follow-up was 45.0 months. The OS results 
at final analysis reached statistical significance. A significantly longer OS was observed in patients in 
the E-Pd arm compared to patients in the Pd arm (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.93; p-value 0.0217), 
representing a 41% reduction in the risk of death. Efficacy results are presented in Table 11 and

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of elotuzumab was studied in patients with multiple myeloma. 
Elotuzumab exhibits nonlinear PK with decrease in clearance with increase in dose from 
0.5-20 mg/kg bw. 
Absorption 
Elotuzumab is dosed via intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The geometric mean volume of distribution of elotuzumab at the recommended dosing regimen in 
combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone at steady state is 
5.7 L (coefficient of variation (CV): 23%) and 5.6 L (CV: 21%) respectively. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolic pathway of elotuzumab has not been characterized. As an IgG monoclonal antibody, 
elotuzumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean total clearance of elotuzumab at 10 mg/kg bw (in combination with lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone) at steady state is 0.194 L/day (CV: 62.9%). Upon discontinuation of elotuzumab 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or in combination with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone, concentrations of elotuzumab will decrease to approximately 3% (approximately 
97% washout as estimated by 5 half-lives) of the population predicted steady-state maximal serum 
concentration by 3 months. 
Special populations 
Based on a population PK analysis using data from 440 patients, the clearance of elotuzumab 
increased with increasing bw supporting a weight-based dose. Population PK analysis suggested that 
the following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of elotuzumab: age, gender, 
race, baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, and 
coadministration with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone. 
Target-mediated clearance of elotuzumab increased with higher serum M-protein concentrations. 
Renal impairment 
An open-label study (CA204007) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (classified using the CrCl values). The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of elotuzumab was evaluated in patients with normal renal function (CrCl > 90 mL/min; N = 8), severe 
renal impairment not requiring dialysis (CrCl <30 mL/min; N = 9), or end-stage renal disease 
requiring dialysis (CrCl < 30 mL/min; N = 9). No clinically important differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab were found between patients with severe renal impairment (with and 
without dialysis) and patients with normal renal function (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Empliciti is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which is principally cleared by catabolism. Thus, hepatic 
functional impairment is not likely to alter its clearance. The effect of hepatic impairment on the 
clearance of Empliciti was evaluated by population PK analyses in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (TB ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or TB < 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST; N = 33). No clinically 
important differences in the clearance of Empliciti were found between patients with mild hepatic 
impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. Elotuzumab has not been studied in patients 
with moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (TB > 3 × ULN and 
any AST) (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Elotuzumab only recognizes human SLAMF7 protein. Because elotuzumab does not recognize 
non-human forms of SLAMF7 protein, in vivo safety data from animal studies are irrelevant. In the 
same line, no carcinogenicity data are available for elotuzumab in animals, nor were fertility and 
embryo-foetal toxicity studies performed. Non-clinical safety information primarily consists of limited 
in vitro human cell/tissue studies where no safety findings were identified.

products. 
6.3  Shelf life 
Unopened vial 
4 years. 
After reconstitution and dilution 
The reconstituted solution should be transferred from the vial into the infusion bag immediately. 
Chemical and physical in use stability of the reconstituted and diluted solution has been demonstrated 
for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C and protected from light. 
From a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C protected from light. Do not freeze the 
reconstituted or diluted solution. The solution for infusion may be stored for a maximum of 8 hours of 
the total 24 hours at 20°C − 25°C and room light. This 8-hour period should be inclusive of the 
product administration period. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). 
Do not freeze. 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
For storage conditions after reconstitution or dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
20 mL Type I glass vial, closed with a grey butyl stopper and sealed with aluminium crimp seal with a 
polypropylene flip off button, containing either 300 mg or 400 mg elotuzumab. The flip-off seal 
button colour is ivory for the 300 mg presentation and blue for the 400 mg presentation. 
Pack size of 1 vial. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Calculating the dose 
Calculate the dose (mg) and determine the number of vials needed for the dose (10 mg/kg or 
20 mg/kg) based on bw. More than one vial of Empliciti may be needed to give the total dose for the 
patient. 
 
The total elotuzumab dose in mg equals the patient’s bw in kg multiplied by the elotuzumab 
dose (10 or 20 mg/kg, see section 4.2).

Reconstitution of vials 
Aseptically reconstitute each Empliciti vial with a syringe of adequate size and an 18 gauge or smaller 
needle as shown in Table 12. A slight back pressure may be experienced during administration of the 
water for injections, which is considered normal.

Hold the vial upright and swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised cake. Then 
invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any powder that may be present on top of the vial or the 
stopper. Avoid vigorous agitation, DO NOT SHAKE. The lyophilised powder should dissolve in less 
than 10 minutes. 
After the remaining solids are completely dissolved, allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 to 
10 minutes. The reconstituted solution is colourless to slightly yellow, and clear to very opalescent. 
Empliciti should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. 
Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. 
Preparation of the solution for infusion 
The reconstituted solution should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection or 5% glucose injection to obtain a final infusion concentration range between 1 mg/mL and 
6 mg/mL. The volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% glucose 
injection should be adjusted so as to not exceed 5 mL/kg of bw at any given dose of Empliciti. 
Calculate the volume (mL) of diluent (either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 
5% glucose injection) needed to make up the solution for infusion for the patient. 
Withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial, up to a maximum of 16 mL 
from 400 mg vial and 12 mL from 300 mg vial. Each vial contains a slight overfill to ensure sufficient 
extractable volume. 
Transfer the withdrawn volumes of all vials needed according to the calculated dose for this patient 
into one single infusion bag made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin containing the calculated volume 
of diluent. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. 
Empliciti is for single use only. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. 
Administration 
The entire Empliciti infusion should be administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
low-protein-binding filter (with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 µm) using an automated infusion pump. 
Empliciti infusion is compatible with: 
 
PVC and polyolefin containers 
 
PVC infusion sets 
 
polyethersulfone and nylon in-line filters with pore sizes of 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm. 
Empliciti should be initiated at an infusion rate of 0.5 mL/min for 10 mg/kg bw dose and 3 mL/min for 
20 mg/kg bw dose. If well tolerated, the infusion rate may be increased stepwise as described in 
Tables 3 and 4 (see section 4.2 Method of administration). The maximum infusion rate should not 
exceed 5 mL/min. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Empliciti infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage 
times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer 
than 24 hours at 2°C − 8°C protected from light. Do not freeze the reconstituted or diluted solution. 
The solution for infusion may be stored for a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours at 
20°C − 25°C and room light. This 8-hour period should be inclusive of the product administration 
period. 
Disposal 
Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicinal product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Possible side effects 
How to store Empliciti 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Empliciti is and what it is used for 
Empliciti contains the active substance elotuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. Elotuzumab attaches to a 
target protein called SLAMF7. SLAMF7 is found in large amounts on the surface of multiple 
myeloma cells and on certain cells of your immune system (natural killer cells). When elotuzumab 
binds to SLAMF7 on the multiple myeloma or natural killer cells, it stimulates your immune system to 
attack and destroy the multiple myeloma cells. 
Empliciti is used to treat multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in adults. Empliciti will be 
given to you together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or together with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called plasma cells. These 
cells divide out of control and collect in the bone marrow. This results in damage to the bones and 
kidneys. 
Empliciti is used if your cancer has not responded to, or has come back after certain treatments. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Empliciti 
You should not be given Empliciti 
 
if you are allergic to elotuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 “Contents of the pack and other information”). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. 
Warnings and precautions 
Infusion related reaction 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion related reactions listed at the top 
of section 4. These side effects mostly occur during or after the infusion of the first dose. You will be 
monitored for signs of such effects during and after the infusion. 
Depending on the seriousness of the infusion related reactions, you may require additional treatment to 
prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, or your infusion of Empliciti may be interrupted. 
When the symptoms go away or improve, the infusion can be continued more slowly and speeded up 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gradually if the symptoms do not recur. Your doctor may decide not to continue Empliciti treatment if 
you have a strong infusion related reaction. 
Before each infusion of Empliciti, you will be given medicines to reduce infusion related reaction (see 
section 3 “How to use Empliciti, Medicines given before each infusion”). 
Before starting treatment with Empliciti, you must also read the package leaflet warnings and 
precautions of all medicines to be taken in combination with Empliciti for information related to these 
medicines. When lenalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention 
requirements is needed (see “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” in this section). 
Children and adolescents 
Empliciti is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. 
Other medicines and Empliciti 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
For women taking Empliciti 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not use Empliciti if you are pregnant, unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The 
effects of Empliciti in pregnant women or its possible harm to an unborn baby are unknown. 
 
You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Empliciti and for 
120 days after stopping treatment, if there is any chance you could become pregnant. 
If you become pregnant while using Empliciti, tell your doctor. 
 
When Empliciti is given in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, you must follow the 
pregnancy prevention programme for lenalidomide or pomalidomide respectively (see package leaflet 
for lenalidomide or pomalidomide). Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are expected to be harmful 
for an unborn baby. 
It is not known, whether elotuzumab passes into breast milk or if there is any risk to the breast-fed 
infant. Elotuzumab will be given in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide and 
breast-feeding should be stopped because of the use of lenalidomide or pomalidomide. 
For men taking Empliciti 
You should use a condom while taking Empliciti and for 180 days after stopping treatment to ensure 
your partner does not become pregnant. 
Driving and using machines 
Empliciti is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you get an 
infusion related reaction (fever, chills, high blood pressure see section 4 “Possible side effects”), do 
not drive, cycle or use machines until the reaction stops. 
Empliciti contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given Empliciti. This 
medicine contains 3.92 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 300 mg vial or 5.23 mg 
sodium per 400 mg vial. This is equivalent to 0.2% or 0.3% respectively, of the recommended 
maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Empliciti 
How much Empliciti is given 
The amount of Empliciti you will be given will be calculated based on your body weight. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Empliciti is given 
You will receive Empliciti under the supervision of an experienced healthcare professional. It will be 
given into a vein (intravenously) as a drip (infusion) over several hours. 
In cycles 1 and 2, once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. 
In cycles 3 and beyond, once every 2 weeks on days 1 and 15. 
Empliciti is taken in treatment cycles that are 28 days (4 weeks) long in combination with other 
medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. 
When given in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, Empliciti is given as follows: 
 
 
When given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, Empliciti is given as follows: 
 
 
Your doctor will continue to treat you with Empliciti for as long as the disease improves or remains 
stable and side effects are tolerable. 
In cycles 1 and 2, once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. 
In cycles 3 and beyond, once every 4 weeks on day 1. 
Medicines given before each infusion 
You must receive the following medicines before each infusion of Empliciti to help reduce possible 
infusion related reactions: 
 
 
 
medicine to reduce an allergic reaction (an anti-histamine) 
medicine to reduce inflammation (dexamethasone) 
medicine to reduce pain and fever (paracetamol) 
If you miss a dose of Empliciti 
Empliciti is used in combination with other medicines for multiple myeloma. If any medicine in the 
treatment is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued, your doctor will decide how your treatment should 
be continued. 
If you are given too much Empliciti 
As Empliciti will be given to you by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely you will be given too 
much. In the unlikely case of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. 
If you stop using Empliciti 
Stopping your treatment with Empliciti may stop the effect of the medicine. Do not stop treatment 
unless you have discussed this with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Preparation and administration of Empliciti 
Calculating the dose 
Calculate the dose (mg) and determine the number of vials needed for the dose (10 mg/kg or 
20 mg/kg) based on body weight (bw). More than one vial of Empliciti may be needed to give the total 
dose for the patient. 
 
The total elotuzumab dose in mg equals the patient’s bw in kg multiplied by the elotuzumab 
dose (10 or 20 mg/kg). 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconstitution of vials 
Aseptically reconstitute each Empliciti vial with a syringe of adequate size and an 18 gauge or smaller 
needle as shown in Table 1. A slight back pressure may be experienced during administration of the 
water for injections, which is considered normal. 
Table 1:  Reconstitution instructions

Hold the vial upright and swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised cake. Then 
invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any powder that may be present on top of the vial or the 
stopper. Avoid vigorous agitation, DO NOT SHAKE. The lyophilised powder should dissolve in less 
than 10 minutes. 
After the remaining solids are completely dissolved, allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 to 
10 minutes. The reconstituted solution is colourless to slightly yellow and clear to very opalescent. 
Empliciti should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. 
Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. 
Preparation of the solution for infusion 
The reconstituted solution should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection or 5% glucose injection to obtain a final infusion concentration range between 1 mg/mL and 
6 mg/mL. The volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% glucose 
injection should be adjusted so as to not exceed 5 mL/kg of bw at any given dose of Empliciti. 
Calculate the volume (mL) of diluent (either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 
5% glucose injection) needed to make up the solution for infusion for the patient. 
Withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial, up to a maximum of 16 mL 
from 400 mg vial and 12 mL from 300 mg vial. Each vial contains a slight overfill to ensure sufficient 
extractable volume. 
Transfer the withdrawn volumes of all vials needed according to the calculated dose for this patient 
into one single infusion bag made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin containing the calculated volume 
of diluent. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. 
Empliciti is for single use only. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. 
Administration 
The entire Empliciti infusion should be administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
low-protein-binding filter (with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 µm) using an automated infusion pump. 
Empliciti infusion is compatible with: 
 
PVC and polyolefin containers 
 
PVC infusion sets 
 
polyethersulfone and nylon in-line filters with pore sizes of 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm. 
Infusion rate for Empliciti 10 mg/kg bw 
Empliciti at 10 mg/kg bw dose should be initiated at an infusion rate of 0.5 mL/min. If well tolerated, 
the infusion rate may be increased stepwise as described in Table 2. The maximum infusion rate 
should not exceed 5 mL/min.

Infusion rate for Empliciti 20 mg/kg bw 
Empliciti at 20 mg/kg bw dose should be initiated at an infusion rate of 3 mL/min. If well tolerated, 
the infusion rate maybe increased in a stepwise fashion as described in Table 3. The maximum 
infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min. 
Patients who have escalated to 5 mL/min at 10 mg/kg bw dose must decrease the rate to 3 mL/min at 
the first infusion at 20 mg/kg bw.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for VAXNEUVANCE™
(Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (15 valent, adsorbed))
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for VAXNEUVANCE™. The RMP 
details important risks of VAXNEUVANCE™, and how more information will be obtained 
about pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (15 valent, adsorbed)'s risks and 
uncertainties (missing information).
VAXNEUVANCE's™ summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet 
give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
VAXNEUVANCE™ should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for VAXNEUVANCE™ should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of
VAXNEUVANCE's™ RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What It Is Used For
VAXNEUVANCE™ is authorised for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive 
disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, 
children and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age. VAXNEUVANCE™ is 
authorised for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individual 18 years of age and older (see SmPC for 
the full indication). It contains pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (15 valent,
adsorbed) as the active substance and it is given by intramuscular injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of VAXNEUVANCE’s™ benefits can be found in 
VAXNEUVANCE’s™ EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available under the
medicine’s webpage link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage.
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of VAXNEUVANCE™, together with measures to minimise such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about VAXNEUVANCE's™ risks, are outlined 
below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
V114

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of VAXNEUVANCE™ is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of VAXNEUVANCE™ are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
VAXNEUVANCE™. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-
term use of the medicine).

and the guidance in GVP module 5 (Rev 2), as per routine updates of the RMP during the life cycle of the product.
II.B
Summary of Important Risks
There are no important identified or potential risks for VAXNEUVANCE™. “Use in adult 
HSCT recipients” previously classified as missing information is removed from the list of 
safety concerns.

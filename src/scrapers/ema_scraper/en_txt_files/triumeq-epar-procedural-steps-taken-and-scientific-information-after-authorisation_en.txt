Following the finalisation of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/WS1810 concerning submission of 
EuroSIDA (category 3 PASS) study, this Type II 
worksharing variation was proposed to address the 
removal of three important risks (Dolutegravir 
Hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatobiliary reactions 
and Serious rash) from all four dolutegravir-
containing product EU-RMPs; Tivicay (dolutegravir), 
Triumeq (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine), Dovato 
(dolutegravir/lamivudine) and Juluca 
(dolutegravir/rilpivirine) - i.e. deletion of safety 
concerns.  
In addition, the MAH took opportunity to propose a 
harmonisation of the risks across all four 
dolutegravir-containing product EU-RMPs and other 
minor updates (including study details and 
epidemiology data). 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed

worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add “completed 
suicide” to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
with frequency ”rare” in the dolutegravir (Tivicay), 
dolutegravir/ abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq) and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (Dovato) following the 
finalisation of PSUSA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010075/202101 (reporting 
period 17 Jan 2020 to 16 Jan 2021) based on reports 
of completed suicide from participants exposed to 
dolutegravir containing regimen in ViiV Healthcare-
sponsored clinical trials. As the changes impact all 
dolutegravir containing products, the MAH submitted 
a worksharing procedure to include 
Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (Juluca) product in 
accordance with Article 20 (worksharing procedure) 
of Commission Regulation (EC) 1234/2008. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in section 4 with a rather 
identical wording.  
Page 7/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed wording should be as follows (identical 
with the suggested wording by the MAH regarding 
Dovato (footnote instead of brackets for the 
explanatory wording is acceptable to be in line with 
already included footnote on suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempt), Triumeq and Juluca. Nevertheless, 
the wording in section 4 for Tivicay is not exactly the 
same as for the other three products and should be 
therefore adapted accordingly).  
Furthermore, it could be considered to add a 
statement for patients in section of the PL that they 
should consult their doctor especially if 
neuropsychiatric side effects occur, since only under 
this condition an adequate reaction by the HCPs 
(knowledge of the adverse effects) is possible.

Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC of 
the fixed-dose combination products Combivir, 
Dovato, Kivexa, Triumeq and Trizivir to include new 
information about use of the products in patients 
with renal impairment. Furthermore, minor editorial 
changes have been implemented throughout the 
Product Information and the lists of local 
representatives have been updated for all products. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
mL/min receiving Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ 
Trizivir may experience a 1.6-to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine 
exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, 
controlled trials comparing Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to 
neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
Page 9/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 
and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components 
administration for safety reasons.

Update of sections 4.5 of the SmPC (for Ziagen, 
Kivexa, Trizivir and Triumeq) and 5.2 (for Triumeq 
only) to add new information about the drug-drug 
interactions between abacavir and riociguat. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Furthermore, 
the MAH took the opportunity to introduce an 
excipient update for Ziagen, Kivexa and Trizivir in 
line with the SmPC guideline, a syringe instruction 
update in the Package Leaflet of Ziagen and a 
revised statetment in section 6.6 of the SmPC for 
Triumeq in line with the QRD template. 
Moreover, minor editorial updates have been 
introduced throughout the Product Information of all 
four products. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
administration of a single dose (0.5 mg) of riociguat 
(CYP1A1 substrate) to HIV patients receiving the 
combination of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine 
(600mg/50mg/300mg once daily) led to an approximately 
three-fold higher riociguat AUC(0-∞) when compared to 
historical riociguat AUC(0-∞) reported in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, when riociguat is co-administered with abacavir, 
its dose may need to be reduced. Consult the riociguat 
prescribing information for dosing recommendations.

In addition, the MAH updated the Package Leaflet of 
Triumeq and Tivicay to include increase in bilirubin 
levels as rare side effect. 
Furthermore, in line with the SmPC guideline, all 
laboratory findings related to hepatitis / acute 
hepatic failure, i.e. including ALT and AST elevations 
currently listed under the SOC “Investigations”, were 
moved to the SOC “Hepatobiliary disorders” in

the safety information regarding the occurrence of 
neural tube defects with the dolutegravir -containing 
regimens based on the interim analysis from the 
Tsepamo study. This is a birth outcomes surveillance 
study being conducted in Botswana that was 
designed to evaluate adverse birth outcomes by HIV 
status and antiretroviral regimen, and to determine if 
there is an increased risk of neural tube defects 
among infants exposed to efavirenz at conception. 
This surveillance system captures all antiretroviral 
exposure including dolutegravir.  
The PL is updated accordingly. 
Dovato (dolutegravir-based products) has been updated to 
include safety information regarding the occurrence of 
neural tube defects (NTDs) with  dolutegravir (DTG)-
containing regimens based on interim analysis from a birth 
outcomes surveillance study being conducted in Botswana 
(the Tsepamo study). This is an observational cohort study 
focusing on the safety of antiretroviral therapy during 
pregnancy and was designed to evaluate adverse birth 
outcomes by HIV status and antiretroviral regimen. 
The assessment of the latest results (July 2020) from the

(0.11%: 95% CI 0.07%, 0.17%) women exposed to non-
DTG regimens at the time of conception. 
The SmPC has been updated to include advice for women 
of childbearing potential to be counselled about the 
potential risk of NTD with DTG, including consideration of 
effective contraceptive measures. 
In addition, a recommendation to discuss the benefits and 
risks of continuing DTG versus switching to another 
antiretroviral regimen has been added in the case when a 
pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester while on DTG.

A new contraindication is added to the Product information 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to add a new contraindication in relation to the co-
administration of dolutegravir with medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic windows that are 
substrates of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), 
including but not limited to fampridine (also known 
as dalfampridine).The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the products information 
have been updated to reflect the following changes: 
- 
remove the drug-drug interactions for 
products no longer authorised in the EU (boceprevir, 
dofetilide, nelfinavir) 
- 
remove the inverted triangle for additional 
monitoring for Dovato only.  
Editorial changes have been made to the product 
information. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflets. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
for dolutegravir containing products namely dolutegravir 
(DTG; TIVICAY), dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine 
(DTG/ABC/3TC; TRIUMEQ), dolutegravir/rilpivirine fixed 
dose combination (DTG/RPV FDC; JULUCA), and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC; DOVATO), to warn of 
concurrent administration of dolutegravir with medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are 
substrates of OCT-2, including but not limited to fampridine 
(also known as dalfampridine).  
Fampridine is a substrate of OCT2 with a narrow 
therapeutic index and could show an increased risk of 
seizures at elevated concentrations. 
While the proposed interaction has not been formally 
investigated in a drug interaction study for dolutegravir, 
the contradiction is accepted given the information stated 
in the approved product labelling for fampridine, and the 
understanding of dolutegravir potential to inhibit OCT2. 
The SmPC section 4.3 and 4.5 and the PL have been 
updated accordingly.

metformin with a calculated IC50 value of 40.4 µM but did 
not inhibit CYP enzymes, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Lamivudine did not inhibit CYP enzymes, OATP1B1, OATP1B 
and MATE2-K.  Neither abacavir nor lamivudine was a 
substrate of CYP enzymes. Abacavir was not a substrate of 
the investigated transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1 
or MATE2-K, whereas active renal secretion of lamivudine 
in the urine is mediated through OCT2 as well as MATE1 
and MATE2-K. Trimethoprim (an inhibitor of these drug 
transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine 
plasma concentrations; however, the resulting increase was 
not clinically significant. Data from literature showed that 
lamivudine was an OCT1 and OCT2 inhibitor. As hepatic 
elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of 
lamivudine, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are 
unlikely to be of clinical significance. 
Although abacavir and lamivudine are substrates of BCRP 
and P-gp in vitro, given the high absolute bioavailability of 
abacavir and lamivudine, inhibitors of these efflux 
transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant 
impact on abacavir or lamivudine concentrations.

Product Characteristics.

administration of sorbitol containing medicines may reduce 
the exposure of lamivudine, possibly resulting in reduced 
virologic suppression or viral resistance. 
Co-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 
g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV daily dose) of 
lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose-dependent 
decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure 
(AUC) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine 
in adults. When possible, avoid chronic co-administration of 
Zeffix with medicinal products containing sorbitol or other 
osmotic acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols 
(e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, maltitol). Consider more 
frequent monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when chronic co-
administration cannot be avoided.

non-inferiority switch study in virologically suppressed 
subjects without any prior treatment failure, and with no 
documented history of resistance to any class. Virologically 
suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) subjects were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to continue their current ART regimen (2 
NRTIs plus either a PI, NNRTI, or INI), or switch to 
ABC/DTG/3TC FDC once daily (Early Switch). Hepatitis B

co-infection was one of the main exclusion criteria. Patients 
were mainly white (66%) or black (28%) of male sex 
(87%). Main prior transmission routes were homosexual 
(73%) or heterosexual (29%) contact. The proportion with 
a positive HCV serology was 7%. The median time from 
first starting ART was around 4.5 years. 
Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) in the 
ABC/DTG/3TC FDC group (85%) was statistically non-
inferior to the current ART groups (88%) at 24 weeks. The 
adjusted difference in proportion and 95% CI 
[ABC/DTG/3TC vs current ART] were 3.4%; 95% CI: [-9.1, 
2.4]. After 24 weeks all remaining subjects switched to 
ABC/DTG/3TC FDC (Late Switch). Similar levels of virologic 
suppression were maintained in both the Early and Late 
Switch groups at 48 weeks.

hepatic impairment, therefore the use of Triumeq is not 
the SmPC with revised wording related to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, in line with the SmPCs of 
other abacavir containing products. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor 
changes in Annex II and the labelling in line with the 
latest QRD template. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

recommended unless judged necessary. In patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) close 
monitoring is required, including monitoring of abacavir 
plasma levels if feasible. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero:  
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues may impact 
mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. 
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in 
HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally 
Page 33/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to nucleoside analogues, these have predominantly 
concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. 
The main adverse reactions reported are haematological 
disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These reactions have 
often been transitory. Some late-onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, 
convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide 
analogues, who presents with severe clinical findings of 
unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These 
findings do not affect current national recommendations to 
use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent 
vertical transmission of HIV.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to

on the intracellular concentrations of ribavirin triphosphate 
after 56 days of treatment (RBV alone: 15.93 pmol/106 
cells; RBV+ABC: 15.87 pmol/106 cells). Although the 
variability of these measures is too high (80-100%) to 
achieve adequate statistical power (a difference between 
these 2 arms only >40% can be excluded), the data are 
nonetheless reassuring, the intracellular values being quite 
similar in between arms. 
In addition, 3 retrospective studies performed in a large 
number of HCV/HIV coinfected subjects do not support a 
potential impact of ABC on the sustained virologic response 
with Peg-IFN+ribavirin. Moreover, the potential interaction 
of ABC on RBV is currently not considered in the European 
guidelines for the treatment of HIV/HCV coinfected 
subjects.

eliminated renally and therefore it is of importance to 
monitor renal function when co-treated with dolutegravir. 
This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (stage 3a 
creatinine clearance [CrCl] 45– 59 mL/min) and a cautious 
approach is recommended. Reduction of the metformin 
dose should be highly considered.

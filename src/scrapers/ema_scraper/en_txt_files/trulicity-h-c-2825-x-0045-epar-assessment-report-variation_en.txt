2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Dulaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, is approved at two strengths; 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg 
solution for injection for subcutaneous use once weekly in the following indication, which remains 
unchanged with this line extension: 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Trulicity is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
• in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
The purpose of this application is to add two new strengths of dulaglutide; 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg solution 
for injection for subcutaneous use once weekly for patients in need of additional glycaemic control. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remains a substantial health care challenge that affects the individual 
patient and the society profoundly. The prevalence of the chronic and progressive metabolic disorder is 
expected to increase worldwide markedly; projections suggest that around 10% of the global adult 
population will be affected by 2045. To avoid the microvascular and macrovascular complications 
associated with the disease, it is a key aim to establish adequate glycaemic control as soon as possible 
after a T2D diagnosis.  
A well-known risk factor for hyperglycaemia, T2D and cardiovascular disease is obesity. A moderate 
weight loss of 5% improves glycaemic control and CV risk factors in patients with T2D, and thereby 
provides beneficial effects on T2D and CV disease. Thus, anti-glycaemic drugs that in addition to 
lowering HbA1c also reduce body weight can provide additional clinical benefits in the treatment of T2D 
and CV disease. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
T2D is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. 
The pathophysiology of T2D is characterised by persistent hyperglycaemia caused by insulin resistance 
in the peripheral tissue, by reduced insulin production in the pancreatic beta-cells and by increased 
hepatic glucose release.  
The pathogenesis is seemingly heterogeneous and also involves environmental, lifestyle, and genetic 
components. All of these factors contribute to chronic hyperglycaemia which, if left untreated, is 
associated with β-cell failure and increased risk of long-term micro- and macrovascular complications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 9/117 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The typical presentation of diabetes includes polyuria and polydipsia. However, many patients with T2D 
are asymptomatic and are diagnosed with non-specific complaints like fatigue, blurred vision, slow-
healing cuts or sores, dry, itchy skin, numbness and tingling feet. 
The diagnosis is made by measurement of hyperglycaemia by demonstrating one of the following: 
• 
Fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) on two separate tests 
[A fasting plasma glucose level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered 
prediabetes and less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal] 
•  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): Plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) two hours after a 
75 gram oral glucose load 
[A reading two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L 
and 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes and less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal] 
•  Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥ 6.5 % (48 mmol/mol) on two separate tests 
[HbA1C between 5.7 % and 6.4 % indicates prediabetes, below 5.7 % is considered normal] 
2.1.5.  Management 
The guidelines of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) for treatment of T2D have been developed in cooperation and are widely 
agreed. The major steps recommended for managing type 2 diabetes are lifestyle changes such as diet 
and exercise. For glycaemic control, primarily metformin, other non-insulin anti-diabetic agents and 
finally insulin (in various forms) are used. 
To avoid the microvascular complications associated with the disease, it is a crucial aim to establish 
adequate glycaemic control as soon as possible after a T2D diagnosis. Besides anti-glycaemic therapy, 
antihypertensive, antithrombotic and lipid lowering treatments might be indicated to avoid other 
associated co-morbidities (e.g. hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia) and macrovascular complications 
(MI, stroke). 
Recently, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in T2D patients at high CV risk have shown not only 
improvements in glycaemic control but also a reduction in body weight and CV events.  
About the product 
Dulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), with 90% amino acid 
sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1, that exhibits GLP-1–mediated effects, including 
glucose-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion, decrease in glucagon secretion, delay of gastric 
emptying, and decrease in appetite. 
Dulaglutide is already approved (date of first authorisation: 21 November 2014) at two dose strengths 
(0.75 mg and 1.5 mg SC injection once weekly) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
Preclinical data and clinical experience support the use of dulaglutide as a once-weekly SC injection to 
improve glycaemic control in adult patients with T2D. As of 31 August 2019, dulaglutide has received 
marketing authorisation in more than 70 countries worldwide and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. The approved doses of dulaglutide include 
0.75 mg and 1.5 mg SC injection once-weekly. Dulaglutide is not approved for any paediatric 
indication. 
The purpose of this application is to add two new higher dose strengths (dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 
mg SC injection once-weekly) for patients who could benefit from additional glycaemic control.  
The design of the registration program to investigate higher doses of dulaglutide was informed by 
available regulatory guidance documents and advice from the EMA/CHMP and FDA.

Overview of Studies Contributing to the Current Marketing Application for Dulaglutide 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Eli Lilly Nederland B V. has submitted a line extension application for Trulicity (INN dulaglutide) under 
Annex I, 2c, of regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 (addition of a new strength). With this line extension two 
new strengths are added: 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg solution for injection for subcutaneous administration 
presented in a pre-filled pen (PFP). 
The new dulaglutide solution for injection strengths utilise the same active substance, same 
formulation components, and same container closure system as approved for Trulicity 0.75 mg and 1.5 
mg solution for injection in a pre-filled pen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 12/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The new strengths include increases in the active substance concentration and a small increase in 
stabiliser (Polysorbate 80) to account for the higher concentration of protein. There were no changes to 
the concentration of the other excipients (sodium citrate, citric acid, mannitol and water for injections) 
which remains the same for all strengths. 
The active substance used for the manufacture of the new strengths is identical to the currently used 
commercial active substance. Consequently, no new information regarding the active substance has 
been provided.  
However, in the course of the development of the additional strengths, it was found that a slightly 
higher amount of polysorbate 80 (0.025% instead of 0.02 %) in the product solution is advantageous 
for the new strengths.  
Where applicable, the analytical methods have been revalidated to account for the additional sample 
matrix. As the analytical methods used for both active substance and finished product are described in 
the active substance section of the dossier, these changes are described in the active substance 
section. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Dulaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog that has been fused to a modified human 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) Fc domain through a short flexible peptide linker. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
N/A (no change) 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
Specifications for 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg solution for injection are the same as those used in the approved 
marketed strengths. The specifications for the active substance include tests for identity, protein 
content, potency, purity, appearance, purity, bacterial endotoxins, bioburden and pH. 
Description and validation of the active substance-related analytical methods used for finished product 
release are included in section S.4 of the dossier. Thus, the changes introduced in the formulation of 
the additional finished product strengths and the necessary adaptations in the analytical methods were 
accounted for in S.4.2 and S.4.3. 
Revised descriptions of the analytical procedures have been provided to include deviating sample 
preparation due to the quantitatively different finished product composition, where applicable.  
The MAH repeated analytical method validation for selected methods to account for the increased 
dulaglutide concentration in the additional strengths of the finished product, and the slightly increased 
polysorbate 80 concentration in the concentrated finished product formulations. Only selected 
validation parameters were repeatedly evaluated. For most parameters, the existing data were 
leveraged.  
Deviations concerning the tests on physical appearance, clarity and polysorbate 80 are due to the 
differences in active substance and polysorbate 80 concentrations and are considered acceptable. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 13/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applied test methods are also the same with respective adaptions concerning the sample preparations. 
Sufficient method validations/verifications were performed where necessary. 
Adequate justifications have been provided for either repeated evaluation or leverage of existing data. 
These are deemed satisfactory and comprehensible.  
The additional validation data provided have adequately addressed the changes introduced by the new 
(concentrated) finished product formulation.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Dulaglutide injection supplied as either 3.0 mg/ 0.5 mL or 4.5 mg/ 0.5 mL is a clear, colorless, slightly 
opalescent, essentially free from particles, sterile, and non-pyrogenic parenteral solution for 
subcutaneous administration. Both dulaglutide finished product strengths are contained in a 1 mL, 
Type I borosilicate glass syringe with a plunger. Each pre-filled pen contains 0.5 mL of solution.  
There are no novel excipients, non-compendial excipients or excipients of human or animal origin used 
in the manufacture of Trulicity 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg. The qualitative composition of dulaglutide finished 
product is dulaglutide (active substance), trisodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid, mannitol, polysorbate 
80, and water for injections. 
The container closure system filled with finished product is referred to as the semi-finished syringe 
(SFS). Each finished product strength is available to patients as a semi-finished syringe (SFS) 
assembled into a pre-filled pen for administration. 
The same pre-filled pen is used for all strengths of dulaglutide injection. The pre-filled pen is spring-
powered and designed to administer the entire contents of the SFS during one injection. After 
injection, the needle automatically retracts into the device and the device is discarded by the patient. 
The device is single-dose and is not intended to be refilled or reused. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) for the new 
strengths of the finished product were defined in accordance with the QTPP and CQAs presented for the 
already authorised finished product strengths. Development experience with the current strengths was 
leveraged and design of experiments (DOE) were applied to find the optimised composition of the new 
finished product strengths. It was found that the polysorbate 80 concentration for the new strengths 
needed to be increased for the current approved strengths. All other excipients are qualitatively and 
quantitatively the same in all strengths. The provided information is considered sufficient.  
The new finished product strengths of 3.0 mg/0.5 mL and 4.5 mg/0.5 mL were subject to phase 1 and 
phase 3 clinical studies. 
The manufacturing process for dulaglutide injection, 3.0 mg /0.5 mL and 4.5 mg /0.5 mL semi-finished 
syringes was based on the experience with the manufacturing process of the current dulaglutide 
injection strengths.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 14/117 
 
 
 
 
 
A risk assessment for the manufacturing process unit operations was performed and the results 
presented. No process steps were ranked as high risk. The risk assessment specifically focused on 
changes of the manufacturing process compared to that for the 0.75 mg/0.5 mL and 1.5 mg/0.5 mL 
strengths.  
The finished product formulation compounding operation involves a variable batch size and different 
mixing equipment compared to dulaglutide 0.75 mg/0.5 mL and 1.5 mg/0.5 mL. Therefore, the impact 
on dulaglutide content uniformity /quantity needed to be evaluated. Peristaltic filling technology is used 
for the filling of dulaglutide injection, 3.0 mg/0.5 mL and 4.5 mg/0.5 mL. The impact of the filling 
process has been evaluated to ensure no impact on the product quality attributes and delivery 
functionality of the semi-finished syringe.  
Process characterization studies were performed for the unit operations with medium risks. Extractable 
and leachable studies for the disposable bags used for buffer and finished product formulation 
compounding have been provided. 
Classification, acceptable ranges, and rationale for process parameters and controls for each unit 
operation have been presented and are considered comprehensive.  
The new strengths of dulaglutide are supplied in the same container closure system used for the 
currently approved strengths of dulaglutide injection, 0.75 mg/0.5 mL and 1.5 mg/0.5 mL.  
Extractable/leachables, compatibility with residual tungsten, needle shield elastomer and silicone oil 
and drug delivery performance were evaluated for the new strengths and found to be not different to 
the currently approved finished product strengths.  
For transportation of the semi-finished syringes the MAH claims that there is no difference between the 
current and new finished product strengths. The evaluation that the semi-finished syringes perform as 
intended after exposure to low-pressure cycling and representative worst-case transportation hazards 
(e.g. shock, temperature, vibration) can be followed. 
A laboratory-based shipping study was conducted to assess the impact of transportation stresses that 
dulaglutide injection, 3.0 mg /0.5 mL and 4.5 mg /0.5 mL contained in a pre-filled pen may encounter. 
No adverse effects on quality attributes of the finished product in commercial packaging configurations 
and exposed to transportation stresses within a temperature range of 1°C to 15°C for 24 days were 
found.  
In addition, to the laboratory-based shipping study a shipping validation study under real 
transportation conditions was performed. The study results are included in section P.3.5. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
GMP compliance has been demonstrated for the manufacturing sites involved in the production and 
testing of dulaglutide finished product. 
The manufacturing process comprises buffer solution compounding, bulk drug product formulation 
compounding, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration as part of the filling process and aseptic 
filling, plungering and inspection.  
A flow chart and a narrative description of the finished product manufacturing process have been 
provided. An adequate control strategy with critical controls and non-critical controls has been 
established.

Information on the validated single use bags used for compounding with respect to name of supplier, 
material composition and sterilization procedure has been included. Details on validated filters and 
filtration conditions used for the bioburden reduction filtration of the bulk finished product solution and 
the sterile filtration are also available. Furthermore, the sterilization conditions for the packaging, i.e. 
syringes (vendor ethylene oxide sterilization) and plungers (vendor sterilized via gamma-irradiation) 
have been adequately characterized. 
Processing time limits have been included and sufficiently validated with respect to bioburden, aseptic 
process simulation (media fill) and microbial retention of the applied filters as applicable. 
Process performance qualification has been sufficiently demonstrated with results gained from three 
batches of each of the new strengths covering lower end and higher end of the batch sizes as defined 
in section P.3.2.  
Satisfactory filter validation has been performed with respect to microbial retention, membrane 
compatibility, product specific bubble point determination and filter extractables. 
Furthermore, satisfactory shipping studies have been performed. The finished product may be shipped 
at 2-8°C, i.e. the long-term storage conditions or alternatively at 2-15°C for a maximum shipping 
duration of 24 days.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The specification for the finished product includes tests for identity, quantity, potency, purity, 
impurities, appearance, osmolality, sterility. 
The specifications were adequately justified and are considered acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications for the new strengths are largely the same as 
for the already approved finished product strengths. Deviations concerning the analytical tests on 
physical appearance, clarity and polysorbate 80 are due to the differences in active substance and 
polysorbate 80 concentrations and are considered acceptable. The applied test methods are also the 
same with respective adaptions concerning the sample preparations. Sufficient methods 
validations/verifications were performed where necessary. 
Batch analyses  
Batch analyses for three validation/primary stability batches of each new strengths and for two clinical 
batches of each new strength have been provided.  
The results confirm consistency and uniformity of the product indicating that the manufacturing 
process for dulaglutide injection, 3.0 mg/0.5 mL and 4.5 mg/0.5 mL is under control. The presented 
results also show no noticeable differences to the results for dulaglutide injection, 0.75 mg/0.5 mL and 
1.5 mg/0.5 mL.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used is the same as the one used for the active substance. Reference is made to 
the currently authorised strengths for further information on the reference standard. 
Container Closure System 
The primary packaging (glass syringe (type I) encased in a disposable pen) for the new finished 
product strengths is the same as for the already approved ones.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of 24 months for the finished product when stored at the long term storage 
condition of 2-8°C with a 14 day patient in-use period at 30°C can be accepted based on the provided 
stability data and considering the stability data of the already approved finished product strengths 
which are comparable.  
The shelf life is based on the provided stability data for six batches, three 3.0 mg/0.5 mL and three 4.5 
mg/0.5 mL finished product batches in pens (primary stability/validation batches) manufactured at the 
intended commercial scale range. The study has been performed in accordance with ICH requirements 
over 9 months at 2-8°C and 6 months at 25°C. The applied analytical procedures are those described 
in section P.5.2 and the primary packaging is that proposed for commercial manufacturing.  
The results which are all within specifications and their statistical evaluation demonstrate little inter-
batch variability. 
In addition, three lots of the validation batches (one 3 mg/0.5 mL and two 4.5 mg/mL) were exposed 
to temperature cycling. Following the temperature excursions, the samples were tested for stability 
indicating attributes and then placed on long term (2°C - 8°C) stability for 24 months.  
Data after nine months storage have been compared to the nine months stability data for samples that 
did not undergo temperature cycles. The starting results are different, but the degradation rates are 
comparable. 
Supporting stability data for semi-finished syringe batches (one clinical and one development batch of 
each strength) stored at 2-8°C for 23.5 months and 24 months respectively followed by 2 weeks at 
30°C/65%RH (test at T0, 1 week and 2 weeks storage) have been included with all results within 
specifications. 
In addition, based on in-use stability data Trulicity finished product may be stored unrefrigerated for 
up to 14 days at a temperature not above 30 ºC. Photostability testing in accordance with ICH Q1B 
and temperature stress testing confirmed that dulaglutide finished product is sensitive to light and 
elevated temperatures. The information included in the SmPC and labelling is in accordance with the 
contents of section P.8. 
Sufficient post approval stability commitments have been provided. 
Post approval change management protocol 
The MAH has provided a post approval change management protocol (PACMP) to introduce a different 
sterilization method for the sterilizing filters instead of the method included in section P.3. In the 
current manufacturing process, the finished product solution is sterilized via a single-use, disposable 
0.22 μm filter assembly.  
The proposed filtration process utilizes a single-use, disposable 0.22 μm filter assembly which is 
sterilized prior to use. The filter material, pore size and membrane type and supplier remain the same. 
The potential impact of the change to the critical quality attributes was evaluated. 
The change management protocol is acceptable considering that filters were already used for the new 
finished products strengths (clinical batches) and have been used for the authorized finished product 
strengths.

Adventitious agents 
There were no changes to the information provided for dulaglutide injection 0.75 mg/ 0.5 mL or 1.5 
mg/0.5 mL. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The documentation provided is considered adequate and complies with existing guidelines. The control 
strategy of the finished product is acceptable. The composition of clinical batches and the composition 
proposed for commercial batches are identical. Sufficient stability data has been provided for the 
claimed shelf life of 24 months for the finished product when stored at the long-term storage condition 
of 2-8°C with a 14 day patient in-use period at a temperature not above 30°C. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality documentation provided in this line extension application to introduce the new 
Trulicity strengths 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, solution for injection is considered acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
No new studies were performed, which is acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new studies were performed, which is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The Applicant has provided a recalculation of the exposure multiples of the toxicology studies 
previously submitted for the higher doses 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg QW. This approach is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has justified that dulaglutide is exempt from an environmental risk assessment by its 
protein nature.  
Dulaglutide is a biological consisting of a peptide fused to an antibody fragment by a linker. All 
components consist of natural proteinogenic amino acids. It is assumed that the protein or peptide part 
will not be excreted in unchanged form and will not reach the environment. An environmental risk 
assessment is therefore not required.

2.3.5.   Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not perform new non-clinical studies. This is considered acceptable since all relevant 
information for the new doses on PK, PD and toxicology of dulaglutide can be derived from existing 
studies. Together with the clinical experience, which has accumulated since the approval of the initial 
MAA, the exposure multiples for the new doses 3.0 and 4,5 mg QW are considered sufficient.

Phase I study GBGM comparing 1 x 4.5 mg vs. 3 x 1.5 mg of dulaglutide  
Title  
Relative  Bioavailability  of  an  Investigational  Single  Dose  of  Dulaglutide  after  Subcutaneous 
Administration by a Single Dose Pen Compared to a Prefilled Syringe in Healthy Subjects 
Objectives 
In  the  phase  2  trial  GBGJ,  dulaglutide  doses  of  3.0 mg  and  4.5  mg  were  administered  as  multiple 
separate injections of 2 x 1.5 mg or 3 x 1.5 mg, respectively, using pre-filled syringes. For the phase 3 
trial  GBGL  (for  discussion  see  corresponding  section),  however,  the  3.0  mg  or  4.5  mg  dose  was 
administered as one single injection, using a single-dose pen.  
The phase 1 study GBGM was performed to show that administration of 3 x 1.5 mg of dulaglutide with a 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) results in comparable pharmacokinetics as administration of 1 x 4.5 mg with a 
single-dose pen (SDP).

Primary objective: relative bioavailability of an s.c. single dose of 4.5 mg dulaglutide; comparison of a 
single injection (SDP; = study drug) with 3 injections of 1.5 mg each (PFS; = reference drug) 
Secondary objective: tolerability of 1 x 4.5 mg injection vs. 3 x 1.5 mg injections. 
Study design 
The study was a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period, crossover study in healthy subjects.  
Subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) one day before dosing. Dosing occurred on 
the  morning  of  day  1  after  an  overnight  fast  of  ~8  h.  Dosing  of  the  subjects  occurred  according  to 
assigned  treatment  sequence  (either  PFS  in  period  1  and  SDP  in  period  2  or  vice  versa).  Standard 
breakfast was served ~5 min after dosing. 
Study drug:  
Dulaglutide 4.5 mg, s.c. injection into abdomen of 1 x 0.5 ml volume (concentration: 
9.0 mg/ml) using a single-dose pen (SDP) 
Reference drug:   Dulaglutide  4.5 mg,  3  x  1.5  mg  s.c.  injections  into  abdomen  (3  x  0.5  ml  volume; 
concentration: 3 mg/ml) using a pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
The blood samples were collected after 0 h (pre-dose) as well as 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 336 
hours post-dose. The tmax is expected at ~48 h post-dosing (SmPC), which corresponds to the second 
post-dosing  sampling  point.  The  wash-out  period  between  periods  1  and  2  was  28  days,  which  is 
sufficiently long (≥5 terminal half-lifes), when a half-life of 4.7 days (SmPC, 1.5 mg dose) is considered.  
Assay validation 
K3EDTA plasma samples (n=442) were analysed using a validated radioimmunoassay method. The assay 
based on the competition between a labeled tracer (125I-GLP-1) and the unlabelled antigen for the GLP-
1(Active)  antibody.  Bound  tracer  is  counted  after  separation  from  free  tracer  in  solution.  Sample 
concentrations  are  determined  by  interpolation  from  the  standard  curve  (4-parameter  algorithm  with 
1/ratio2 weighting). The samples were stored at a nominal temperature of -80°C prior to analysis. The 
calibration  curves  range  from  1.00  ng/ml  to  50 ng/ml.  According  to  the  concentration  table  in  the 
bioanalytical  report (Table 5 on  p 19-34),  the majority of  samples had to be diluted (please see also 
below “Failed runs and re-analysed samples”).   
Pre-study validation: 
LLOQ: 5.00 ng/ml; ULOQ: 50.0 ng/ml 
Inter-assay accuracy: -6.72% to 2.86%; Inter-assay precision: 6.73% to 22.2% 
Intra-assay accuracy: -18.3% to -7.68%; Intra-assay precision: 1.51% to 12.7% 
The  stability  of  the  analyte  was  demonstrated  for  up  to  735  d  in  K3EDTA-containing  human  plasma 
at -70°C and for 25 h in thawed matrix. The sample storage time in the study did not exceed the validated 
time span of 735 days (first subject enrolled on 07 December 2017; last sample analysed on 01 August 
2018). 
Freeze/thaw  stability  was  demonstrated  over  five  cycles  for  quality  control  samples  stored  at 
nominal -20°C and -70°C. 
Hook Effect (inhibition of assay response due to excess analyte concentrations) was excluded up to an 
analyte concentration of ~1000 ng/mL, and haemolysis did not relevantly affect assay results. 
Analytical interference with concomitant medications was analysed and  excluded for atorvastatin (0.2 
µg/ml),  lisinopril  (0.3  µg/ml),  metoprolol  (0.3  µg/ml),  sitagliptin  (1.5  µg/ml),  ethinylestradiol  (1.0 
ng/ml),  norgestimate  (20  ng/ml),  warfarin  (10  µg/ml),  digoxin  (1.5  µg/ml),  metformin  (15  µg/ml), 
pioglitazone (5 µg/ml) and insulin lispro (2000 pM).

Incurred sample re-analysis (ISR) was performed with only 4.5 % of the samples, because one of two 
ISR runs (16RJFN) was rejected and the ISR samples were inadvertently omitted, when the run was 
repeated. However, this is of no concern as 100% of these samples fulfilled the criteria 
Failed runs and re-analyzed samples: 
2 out of 21 bioanalytical runs failed due to unacceptable quality control samples. 39.1% of samples 
were repeated, mostly (28%) due to “result above upper limit of quantitation”, requiring dilution. No 
sample was repeated because of pharmacokinetic reasons. 
Sample size estimation  
For  sample  size  calculation,  it  was  assumed  that  within-subject  variability  (coefficient  of  variation)  of 
dulaglutide is 21% for AUC and Cmax (basing on data from previous studies). To achieve a 90% probability 
that the half-width of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the geometric means for AUC and 
Cmax  is  ≤14%,  a  sample  size  of  18  subjects  was  calculated.  Additional  subjects  were  included  to 
compensate for potential dropouts and withdrawals. In total, 27 subjects were enrolled (23 initially, and 
4 additional subjects later due to early withdrawals). 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Evaluation of log-transformed Cmax, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-168h) and AUC(0-336h) was performed using a 
linear mixed-effects analysis of  variance model with  fixed  effects for  treatment  (SDP or PFS),  period, 
and sequence, and a random effect for subject within sequence. The ratios of least squares geometric 
means of SDP compared to PFS, as well as the corresponding 90% CIs were estimated and reported. 
Tmax  was  analysed  non-parametrically  using  the  Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test.  Estimates  of  the  median 
difference  and  the  corresponding  90%  CIs  were  evaluated.  The  data  analysis  method  used  by  the 
applicant corresponds to the recommendations of the EU bioequivalence guideline (90% CIs for ratio of 
geometric means of test compared to reference, ANOVA analysis with log-transformed parameters).  
Results of study GBGM 
Characteristics of the dosed study population 
The design of study GBGM largely corresponds to the design recommended by the EU bioequivalence 
guideline  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/  Corr  **).  The  study  included  healthy  volunteers  (57.7% 
males and 42.3% females; 26 subjects treated at least once) aged 41.2 ± 10.4 years (from 27 to 59 
years). The mean BMI was 30.66 ± 3.95 kg/m2 (range: 24 - 42.3 kg/m2) and exceeded the maximum 
of 30 kg/m2 recommended by the bioequivalence guideline. However, inclusion of overweight and obese 
subjects is acceptable, as the target population of dulaglutide (patients with T2DM) is expected to exhibit 
similar characteristics. Except vitamin/mineral supplements and/or HRT, prescription medications were 
not  permitted  from  14  days  prior  to  drug  administration  and  throughout  the  study.  Over-the-counter 
medications were not allowed from 7 days prior to drug administration and throughout the study, except 
for acetaminophen (1 g, maximum 4 g per 24 h).

7 of the 8 subjects that withdrew from the study had received at least 1 dose of dulaglutide and were 
included in the PK dataset. 3 subjects received only PFS dosing (3 x 1.5 mg) and 2 subjects were dosed 
via SDP only (1 x 4.5 mg). Table 1 summarizes all PK data. Table 2 contains only data from the subjects 
who received both formulations and shows the statistical analysis of the PK parameters (Wilcoxon signed-
rank test). The time-plasma concentration profile is depicted in Fig. 1.

AUC(0-∞)  was  calculated  for  only  23  subjects  and  not  for  24  subjects  (Table  1  and  2),  because  no 
regression was possible for 1 subject (less than 3 data points after Cmax). 
Cmax was the first point of the PK curve in a considerable proportion of subjects of the PFS (20.8%) and 
SDP (30.4%) group.  
Protocol deviations 
None of the protocol deviations affected the safety of the subjects or the conclusions of the study. There 
were no significant good clinical practice issues. 
Conclusions 
No  notable  differences  occurred  between  SDP  and  PFS  administration  with  regard  to  the  various 
measures of AUC. In addition, the individual AUC data provided by the applicant for each subject do not 
indicate a common trend towards increase or decrease of AUC, when both types of administration are 
compared.  
The  value  for  Cmax  is  larger,  and  Tmax  is  reached  earlier  after  administration  of  1  x  4.5 mg  (SDP)  as 
compared  to  3  x  1.5  mg  (PFS).  The  tendency  towards  a  higher  incidence  of  vomiting  with  SDP  as 
compared to PFS administration may reflect these differences in pharmacokinetics. The 90% CI of the 
comparison of the Cmax values (0.993, 1.30) slightly exceeds the range of 0.8 - 1.25 recommended for 
bioequivalence studies. Moreover, Cmax was the first point of the PK curve in a considerable proportion 
of subjects of the PFS (20.8%) and SDP (30.4%) group. However, the dulaglutide PK profile is very flat 
between  day  1  and  day  3.  Thus,  it  is  expected  that  there  is  only  a  minor  contribution  of  Cmax  to  the 
calculation  of  overall  AUC.  In  summary,  the  two  methods  of  administration  are  considered  largely 
comparable and the purpose of study GBGM (bridging of the forms of administration in study GBGJ and 
GBGL) is considered fulfilled.

During  development  of  the  population  PK  model  for  study  GBGL  (see  detailed  discussion  below),  the 
influence of dose on bioavailability (F1) was considered negligible (mean population F1 values for 1.5

mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg was 0.471, 0.470 and 0.469, respectively). By contrast, for the 0.75 mg and for 
the 1.5 mg dose a dose-dependency of F1 was reported (Trulicity EPAR EMA/CHMP/524604/2014) with 
F1 = 44-47% for the 1.5 mg dose and F1 = 65% for the 0.75 mg dose. 
Distribution 
As shown in study GBGM (Table 1, above), the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was comparable 
for both forms of administration, 3 x 1.5 mg as well as 1 x 4.5 mg: 
PFS (3 x 1.5 mg):  
Vz/F = 14.4 L and  
Vss/F = 17.6 L 
SDP: (1x 4.5 mg):  
Vz/F = 13.9 L and  
Vss/F = 16.5 L  
In general, Vz/F determined in study GBGM is lower than previously reported for single dosing of 
1.5 mg of Dulaglutide (19.5 L; Trulicity EPAR EMA/CHMP/524604/2014).  
Elimination 
Classical  biotransformation  studies  are  not  required  for  Dulaglutide,  which  is  metabolized  through 
proteolytic degradation into its amino acid components. Elimination of intact substance in the urine is 
not to be expected (cf. Trulicity EPAR: EMA/CHMP/524604/2014). 
Half-life, Metabolism and excretion 
For  the  4.5  mg  dose  administered  in  Study  GBGM,  the  half-life  was  around  3.5  days  (see  Table  1).  
Since Dulaglutide is a protein, it is metabolized by general protein catabolism pathways, yielding amino 
acids.  Dulaglutide  can  be  cleaved  by  dipeptidylpeptidase  4  (DPP-4)  to  yield  the  truncated  GLP-Fc 
metabolite 9-37GLP-Fc. In vitro assays suggest that this metabolite is an agonist, but with 15,000-fold 
reduced potency as compared to the parent compound Dulaglutide. Thus, the contribution of 9-37GLP-
Fc to the pharmacodynamic response can be considered negligible. 
Dose proportionality 
Population PK models after multiple dosing of 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg of dulaglutide 
Study GBGJ: 
A total of 1116 PK measurements from 236 patients were used for population PK modelling. The following 
sampling schedule was used to obtain the PK samples in study GBGJ: 
In the following, only the sampling schedule related to PK/PD is discussed. 
Venous blood samples (~ 4 ml) were drawn to include a range of sampling time windows (pre-dose, 1-
24 h post-dose, 24-96 h post-dose and 120-168 h post-dose): 
Visit 3, week 0:  
1-24 hours post-injection of study drug 
Visit 4, week 2:  
immediately prior to administration of study drug 
Visit 5, week 4:  
1-24 hours post-injection of study drug 
Visit 6, week 6: 
5-7  days  (120-168  hours)  post-injection  of  Week  5  study  drug  or  just  pre-
injection of Visit 6 study drug 
Visit 10, week 10: 
1-4 days (24-96 hours) post-injection of Visit 10 study drug 
Visit 12, week 18: 
at any time during the visit 
Samples  were  isolated  from  all  patients,  but  only  the  samples  from  patients  assigned  to  one  of  the 
dulaglutide  study  arms  were  analysed  for  drug  concentrations.  Where  possible,  each  PK  sample  was 
accompanied by an immunogenicity sample in the same visit. Fig. 2 shows the visual predictive check 
to validate the PK model for study GBGJ. The calculated values for Cmax in steady state (Cmax,ss) and for 
AUC(0-168)ss are listed in Table 3.

The development of cmax,ss from the 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dose follows a linear relationship with 
a proportionality factor of ~0.8. Doubling of the dose from 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg increased cmax,ss by a factor 
of ~1.67, which is largely consistent with the factor of 1.8-1.88 derived from the single- and multiple 
dose-studies reported in the Trulicity EPAR (EMA/CHMP/524604/2014).  
AUC(0-168)ss increases almost proportionally, when the dose is doubled from 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg (factor 
2.26) or tripled from 1.5 mg to 4.5 mg (factor 3.10), which is largely consistent with the data previously 
reported in the Trulicity EPAR (almost proportional increase of AUC(0-∞) by 1.84- to 1.9-fold). 
Study GBGL: 
A total of 4929 observations from 1843 subjects were used to develop the population PK model. About 
96%  of  these  4929  samples  were  taken  earlier  than  350  hours  post-dose.  More  than  half  of  these 
samples (66%) were taken between 0 and 168 h post-dose, with the majority being collected around 
168 h post-dose. One outlier with 1108.7 ng/ml (> 3 x SD) at visit 9 (4.5 mg group) was kept, because 
no specific reason was identified that would justify exclusion. However, the data point was excluded from 
the figures.  
The observed dulaglutide concentrations at steady state (week 36) demonstrate a  clear separation of 
the 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group as well as a linear increase in plasma concentration with dose 
(Fig. 3). This demonstrates that higher doses are in fact associated with increased exposure.

Base PK model 
Since the population PK model developed in study GBGJ (see above) adequately described dulaglutide 
PK, a structurally similar base model was developed for study GBGL. The model for GBGL did not 
contain any pre-identified covariates from study GBGJ, but informative priors from model GBGJ were 
implemented on several PK parameters and on the interindividual variability of several PK parameters.  
The population PK model was a two-compartment model, assuming first-order absorption and first-
order elimination. The s.c. bioavailability was fixed to the value of 47%, which corresponds to the 
absolute bioavailability determined for the 1.5 mg dose in study H9X-MC-GBDR. The base model was 
tested by visual predictive check. 
Identification of significant covariates 
An  effect  of  the  baseline  body  weight  on  clearance  was  identified.  The  dose  seemed  to  influence 
bioavailability (F1), but the effect was not meaningful (1.5 mg: F1=0.471; 3.0 mg: F1=0.470 and 4.5 
mg: F1=0.469) and therefore excluded from the full model.  
Results from the final model 
The validity of the model was supported by visual predictive checks (Fig. 4). The model revealed that 
the overall volume of dulaglutide distribution was close to the intravascular blood volume, confirming 
that  dulaglutide  does  not  distribute  into  the  tissue.  This  is  expected,  because  dulaglutide  is  a  large 
molecule.  A  significant  effect  of  baseline  body  weight  on  clearance  was  identified.  The  other  PK 
parameters were unaffected by baseline BW. The mean AUC(0-168)ss ratio for 70 kg vs. 93 kg was 1.25; 
the  corresponding  ratio  for  120  kg  vs.  93  kg  was  0.808.  This  indicates  that  dulaglutide  exposure 
decreases  with  increasing  body  weight.  This  model  yielded  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetic  results 
shown in Table 4

Age and Impaired renal function 
The  population  mean  was  predicted  using  the  population  PK  model  detailed  above.  Fig.  5  shows  the 
ratios of the predicted post hoc PK exposures in special populations and the predicted population mean.

Figure 5: Forest plot, ratios of predicted post hoc PK exposures in study GBGL divided by the 
mean model predictions at the same dose (AUC: = steady-state AUC0-168 h) 
The CKD stages listed in Fig. 5 are defined as follows:  
Stage 1 = eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage 2 = 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
Stage 3a = 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage 3b = 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
The mean drug exposure ratios of all special population subgroups shown in Fig. 5 were between 0.975 
and 1.28. The predictions suggest a tendency towards increased dulaglutide exposure with higher age 
(≥75 years) and more pronounced renal impairment.  
Weight 
A significant effect of baseline body weight on clearance was observed. Table 5 shows that AUC(0-168)ss 
decreases with increasing body weight. 
Table 5: Effect of the body weight covariate on AUC(0-168)ss 
In comparison to the AUC(0-168)ss in a 70 kg-patient, the AUC(0-168)ss decreases by ~20% and ~35% 
for  persons  with  93  kg  and  120 kg,  respectively.  This  relationship  is  similar  for  all  three  dulaglutide 
doses.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  dulaglutide  EPAR  that  reports  a  statistically  significant  inverse 
relationship  between  body  weight  and  dulaglutide  exposure.  However,  even  in  the  120  kg  patients,

HbA1c  efficacy  is  still  preserved  and  dulaglutide  concentrations  are  still  above  the  EC50  required  for 
adequate glycaemic control. There is no significant difference in HbA1c efficacy and overall safety profile 
between  patients  with  body  weight  <median  or  ≥median.  Thus,  the  PK  differences  between  different 
body weight groups do not translate to clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety. 
Prediction of PK interactions due to dulaglutide-induced delay in gastric emptying 
As a GLP-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide delays gastric emptying and intestinal transit time. This may 
result in delayed oral absorption of concomitantly administered drugs. Dulaglutide-mediated changes in 
gastric emptying were simulated in a Pop-PK model (for detailed discussion, please see below), basing 
on  data  from  the  phase 1  studies  H9X-MC-GBCH  and  H9X-MC-GBCD.  In  this  Pop-PK  simulation,  the 
effect of the single dulaglutide doses 1 mg, 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg on gastric emptying was estimated based 
on  corresponding  changes 
in  acetaminophen  pharmacokinetics.  Since  orally  administered 
acetaminophen  is  poorly  absorbed  by  the  stomach  and  is  instead  rapidly  absorbed  from  the  small 
intestine, the rate of appearance of acetaminophen in the circulation reflects the rate of gastric emptying.    
The changes in gastric mean residence times for the 1 mg, 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg dose from the pop-PK 
model were then used in a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. The PBPK model was 
employed to predict the effect of a single dose of 4.5 mg dulaglutide on Cmax, tmax and AUC of various 
orally administered medications (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, digoxin, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, 
sitagliptin, S-warfarin, ethinylestradiol, and norgestimate/norelgestromin).  
In  the  following,  the  pop-PK  model  with  Acetaminophen  and  the  final  PBPK  model  are  discussed 
separately. 
Pop-PK analysis: Dulaglutide effect on gastric emptying based on the PK of acetaminophen  
Datasets used for model development evaluation: 
The results of the previously performed studies H9X-MC-GBCD and H9X-MC-GBCH were used to evaluate 
the model.  
Study  H9X-MC-GBCD  (5  weeks  duration)  comprised  43  T2DM  patients,  and  the  dulaglutide  doses 
0.05 mg, 0.3 mg, 1,0 mg, 3.0 mg, 5.0 mg and 8.0 mg were administered s.c. on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 
29. Acetaminophen (490 mg) was administered orally on days -1 and 3. PK samples for acetaminophen 
were drawn on days -1 and 3 (pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours post-dose). PK samples 
for dulaglutide were collected on day 1 (pre-dose, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose), on days 8, 15, 
and 22 (only pre-dose) and on day 29 (pre-dose, 24, 48, 72, 144, 168, 264 and 336 hours post-dose).  
Study H9X-MC-GBCH (4 weeks duration) comprised 30 healthy subjects. Dulaglutide was administered 
at the 1 mg and 3 mg dose level on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Acetaminophen was administered orally on 
days -1, 3, 24, and 36 with breakfast.  
The population PK analysis included 762 observed plasma dulaglutide concentrations from 62 subjects 
and 1353 observed acetaminophen concentrations from 73 subjects. 
PK models for dulaglutide and acetaminophen 
Dulaglutide PK model: A model for dulaglutide population PK was previously published as the result 
of a pop-PK analysis of dulaglutide conducted for phase 2 and 3 studies in T2DM patients [Geiser et al., 
Clin Pharmacokinet. 2016;55:625-634]. This model was used to describe the dulaglutide data from the 
studies  GBCD  and  GBCH.  The  dulaglutide  PK  model  was  linked  to  the  acetaminophen  PK  model  (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 30/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
below) through a nonlinear inhibitory effect of dulaglutide concentrations on the gastric emptying rate 
constant from the stomach to small intestine. 
Acetaminophen  PK  model:  The  model  structure  from  a  previously  published  [Alskär  et  al.  J  Clin 
Pharmacol. (2016) 56:340-348] semi-mechanistic gastric emptying acetaminophen model was used to 
describe the acetaminophen concentrations from studies GBCD and GBCH. It is noted that the estimate 
for kGE (gastric emptying rate at baseline in study GBCD) showed a high inter-individual variability (IIV) 
of 70.2%, which is, however, similar to the 50% IIV previously published by Alskär et al. (2016) [J Clin 
Pharmacol. (2016) 56:340-348]. 
The dulaglutide PK model linked to the semi-mechanistic gastric emptying acetaminophen PK model was 
evaluated  by  comparing  observed  and  predicted  results  from  studies  GBCD  and  GBCH.  The  visual 
predictive  checks  for  study  GBCD  and  GBCH  demonstrated  that  the  model  accurately  described  the 
development of plasma dulaglutide and acetaminophen concentrations in these studies.  
Application of the results 
Using the dulaglutide PK model linked to the GE acetaminophen PK model, the fraction of acetaminophen 
dose remaining in the stomach over time for a range of dulaglutide doses was simulated and a half-life 
for the gastric acetaminophen dose remnant (GE half-life, GT50) was calculated. Acetaminophen GE half-
life in patients with T2DM was calculated to be 11.9 min at baseline and 57.2 min with co-administration 
of 4.5 mg of dulaglutide. The predictions indicate a clear difference in the baseline GT50 between healthy 
subjects (study GBCH) and patients with T2DM (study GBCD).  
However,  the  fold  change  (GE  time  ratio)  of  acetaminophen  co-administered  with  dulaglutide  vs. 
acetaminophen  alone  (baseline)  was  similar  between  healthy  subjects  and  T2DM  patients.  This  ratio 
term  (delayed  GE  with  co-administered  dulaglutide/GE  prior  to  dulaglutide  exposure)  can  be  used  to 
translate population PK modeling results into the effect of dulaglutide on GE. Thus, the ratio term can 
be incorporated into a PBPK model that predicts the effect of delayed gastric emptying on the exposure 
of  various  orally  co-administered  drugs  for  a  4.5  mg  dose  of  dulaglutide.  Fig.  6  shows  the  model-
predicted fold change in gastric emptying time for various dulaglutide doses.

Figure 6: Model-predicted relationship between dulaglutide concentration and fold change in 
gastric emptying time for acetaminophen in patients with T2D. 
PBPK gastric emptying model 
The changes in gastric mean residence times for the 1 mg, 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg dose from the pop-PK 
model (see Fig. 6) were then used in a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. The PBPK 
model was employed to predict the effect of a single dose of 4.5 mg dulaglutide on Cmax, tmax and AUC 
of various orally administered medications (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, digoxin, lisinopril, metformin, 
metoprolol, sitagliptin, S-warfarin, ethinylestradiol, and norgestimate/norelgestromin).  
First,  a PBPK  model for  acetaminophen  was developed with the software Simcyp® based  on a model 
described in the literature. This model was modified including a mechanistic absorption model in order 
to be able to describe the influence of dulaglutide-induced delay in gastric emptying (GED) on the PK of 
acetaminophen. There are several assumptions underlying the PBPK modelling analyses. The GED ratios 
applied  to  the  gastric  mean  residence  time  in  Simcyp®  assumed  that  the  fold  change  was  the  same 
between healthy subjects and T2DM patients. Different gastric emptying times were applied for fasted 
and fed state but it was assumed that the effect of delaying gastric emptying was the same between 
fasted  and  fed  states.  These  assumptions  was  justified  by  the  Applicant  .Moreover,  observed  and 
predicted  concentrations  of  acetaminophen  with  and  without  dulaglutide  indicate  that  high 
acetaminophen  Cmax  values  are  not  well  captured  by  the  model.  The  newly  provided  pcVPC  depicted 
according to Bergstrand et al (2011) showed that overall, PBPK model performance can be acceptable. 
Further, PBPK models for the different potentially comedicated drugs were developed. Existing Simcyp® 
verified  models  for  digoxin,  metformin,  metoprolol,  S-warfarin,  and  ethinylestradiol  were  modified  to 
include a mechanistic absorption model. The PBPK model for metoprolol extended release (Toprol-XL) 
was built based on the SV-Metoprolol (IR) model built and verified by Simcyp®.

For the other drugs (atorvastatin, lisinopril, sitagliptin and norgestimate/norelgestromin), PBPK models 
were developed according to literature or were built in based on available data.  
Prior observations have indicated that the effect of dulaglutide on acetaminophen tmax and Cmax is highest 
after the first dose and diminished in steady state after multiple dosing. Therefore, it was assumed that 
the simulations basing on single-dose data are appropriate for assessing the maximum dulaglutide effect 
on gastric emptying.  
Model validation 
The PBPK modeling approach was verified with data from previous drug-drug interaction (DDI) trials with 
1 mg of  dulaglutide  (acetaminophen) and with 1.5 mg of  dulaglutide (atorvastatin, digoxin,  lisinopril, 
metformin, metoprolol, sitagliptin, S-warfarin, ethinylestradiol, and norgestimate/norelgestromin). The 
baseline  metformin  PK  data  from  the  metformin  DDI  study  (study  GBDM)  could  not  be  used  for 
verification,  because  study  GBDM  did  not  collect  accurate  information  on  the  doses  of  metformin 
administered. However, the change in metformin exposure before and after dulaglutide dosing was used 
for  verification.  Moreover,  literature  results  were  used  for  verification  of  the  PBPK  modeling  with 
metformin.  
Most of the predicted Cmax and AUC values before and after administration of dulaglutide were between 
80  and  125%  of  the  observed  results.  The  dulaglutide-induced  changes  in  Cmax  and  AUC  were  all 
predicted by the models in a range between 74 and 100%. The dulaglutide-induced change in tmax was 
under-predicted  by  >1  hour  for  atorvastatin,  o-hydroxyatorvastatin  and  metoprolol,  while  Δtmax  was 
over-predicted by 1.81 hours for metformin under fed conditions.  
In  the  responses,  additional  information  supporting  model  qualification  was  provided,  including 
justification for the use of the baseline gastric mean residence times in the fed and the fasted state and 
in healthy volunteers and patients. Additional information on the ability of the model to predict gastric 
emptying delay of other GLP-1 RA are given. It was clarified that data were available for higher doses of 
dulaglutide up to 8 mg, thus no extrapolation was needed for the 4.5 mg dose. 
Accuracy of prediction of different doses, single and multiple doses and data in the fed and fasted state 
were provided for the marker substances. 
PK changes of co-administered drugs in patients with plasma dulaglutide levels at the upper 5% end of 
the  observed  range  were  given  and  did  not  show  significant  changes  for  most  compounds.  For 
atorvastatin, AUC and Cmax were considerably decreased with delayed gastric emptying, in contrast to 
behaviour of the other compounds. 
And a pcVPC was provided for the acetaminophen data which showed acceptable fit. 
Thus, overall with the provided information, the PBPK model is considered acceptable. 
Results after application of the PBPK model to predict the effect of 4.5 mg of Dulaglutide 
The validated models were used to predict the effect of a single 4.5 mg dose of dulaglutide on the PK of 
concomitantly administered medications. The corresponding delay of gastric mean residence time was 
taken from the Pop-PK model developed with acetaminophen (see below, “in vivo” section).  
For  nearly  all  tested  compounds,  the  predicted  AUC  ratios  of  most  drugs  with  and  without  4.5  mg 
dulaglutide were in the range between 0.82 and 1.0 (see Table 6). Only metoprolol exhibited an AUC 
ratio of 1.35 (Table 6).

PK/PD model for fasting glucose did not identify any covariate in study GBGJ. However, in study GBGL, 
baseline fasting glucose was associated with increased dulaglutide EC50 plasma concentrations. This was 
considered not to be of clinical concern, because the dulaglutide concentrations after administration of 
1.5 mg, 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg are generally expected to remain above the EC50 value.  
Weight change 
The  PK/PD  model  for  weight  change  was  the  same  for  study  GBGJ  and  GBGL.  Sex  was  included  as 
covariate  to  enable  differentiation  of  baseline  weight  between  male  and  female  patients  (~10  kg 
difference). In study GBGJ, a dose-dependent increase in body weight reduction from a common body 
weight of 92 kg was predicted, confirming a potential additional benefit for the 3.0 mg and the 4.5 mg 
dose. In study GBGL, body weight reduction was in general more pronounced than in study GBGJ, which 
is most likely due to the longer duration of study GBGL.

Female  patients  had  a  higher  probability  of  developing  nausea  and/or  vomiting  as  compared  to  male 
patients.  In  study  GBGJ,  a  half-life  of  5.03  weeks  was  predicted  for  maximum  tolerance  to  develop. 
Based on these results, an up-titration scheme was implemented in the pivotal phase 3 study GBGL.  
The PK/PD modelling in study GBGL estimated a “half-life” of 6.2 weeks (43.2 days) for the development 
of tolerance to nausea. This confirmed the findings from study GBGJ and further justified the up-titration 
approach  in  study  GBGL.  In  study  GBGL,  the  model  predictions  for  vomiting  were  higher  than  the 
observed data, probably due to the small number of vomiting events as well as higher variability and 
lack of consistency of the observed data during the initial 8 weeks. Body weight <93 kg or ≥93 kg was 
identified as additional covariate in study GBGL and was kept for the final model (higher incidence of 
nausea and vomiting in patients with lower body weight). 
Heart rate, QTcF interval and PR interval 
In  both  studies  (GBGJ  and  GBGL),  increased  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  were  significantly 
correlated with  an increased heart rate  (ECG  and  pulse). The variability  of  changes from  baseline HR 
measurements was considerable, but comparable in dulaglutide vs. placebo-treated patients.  
In  study  GBGJ,  the  model-predicted  increase  in  heart  rate  for  the  mean  Cmax,ss  of  205  ng/ml  (to  be 
expected with the 4.5 mg dose) was more than twice as high as the increase previously predicted for 
the 1.5 mg dose (2.6 bpm; reported in the EPAR, based on data from phase 3 trials and from study H9X-
MC-GBDN). The reduction of QTc interval predicted for the mean Cmax,ss of 205 ng/ml (to be expected 
for the 4.5 mg dose) confirmed the observations of study H9X-MC-GBCC (reported in the EPAR), where 
a dose of 4 mg was administered.  
In study GBGL the heart rate increased during the first 18 weeks, followed by a decline until week 36. 
The  dulaglutide  plasma  concentration  correlated  with  QTcF  interval  shortening  and  PR  interval 
prolongation, but only the correlation with PR interval prolongation reached significance in study GBGJ 
and GBGL (p<0.05).  
Pancreatic enzymes 
In  study  GBGJ,  a  significant  positive  correlation  of  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  with  pancreatic 
amylase and lipase was identified. This initial increase in pancreatic amylase and lipase was followed by 
a gradual reduction over time, but values did not completely return to baseline at the last measurement 
in  week  22.  By  contrast,  in  study  GBGL,  the  correlation  was  positive  for  p-amylase  and  negative  for 
lipase but did not reach statistical significance for any of the parameters. This difference between study 
GBGJ and GBGL might be due to the different up-titration schemes (faster up-titration in study GBGJ as 
compared to GBGL). For a detailed discussion on the effect of up-titration on the occurrence of adverse 
events, please see safety section. 
Anti-drug antibodies 
Neither in study GBGJ nor in study GBGL, was a visually evident pattern observed that could be used to 
establish a relationship between dulaglutide plasma concentration and anti-drug antibodies.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Phase 1 study GBGM: 
The phase 1 clinical study GBGM was conducted to bridge the different ways of dulaglutide administration 
used in trials GBGJ and GBGL (3 x 1.5 mg with pre-filled syringe in study GBGJ, but 1 x 4.5 mg with 
single-dose pen in study GBGL). Study GBGM demonstrated that these two ways of administration are 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 35/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bioequivalent with regard to AUC. With reference to Cmax, the upper limit of the 90% CI for the SDP/PFS 
ratio  reached  1.30,  which  slightly  exceeds  the  conventional  bioequivalence  range  of  0.8  -  1.25.  The 
higher Cmax may be responsible for the more frequent occurrence of vomiting after SDP as compared to 
PFS administration in study GBGM. However, in clinical reality, a slow up-titration is performed until the 
maximum dose of 4.5 mg is reached, which minimizes such adverse events. Cmax was the first point of 
the  PK  curve  in  a  considerable  proportion  of  subjects  of  the  PFS  (20.8%)  and  SDP  (30.4%)  group. 
However, since the dulaglutide PK profile is very flat between day 1 and day 3, it is expected that there 
is only a minor contribution of Cmax to the calculation of overall AUC. 
Thus, the two ways of administration compared in study GBGM can be considered bioequivalent, and the 
results of the phase 2 GBGJ study are able to support the findings of study GBGL. 
Studies GBGJ (phase 2) and GBGL (pivotal phase 3): 
Pharmacokinetics 
According to EPAR EMA/CHMP/524604/2014, the absolute bioavailability (F1) is dose-dependent (F1=44-
47% for the 1.5 mg dose and F1=65% for the 0.75 mg dose). By contrast, during development of the 
final population PK model for study GBGL, the influence of dose on F1 was considered negligible (F1 for 
1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg was 0.471, 0.470 and 0.469, respectively). This suggests that the dose-
dependent decrease in bioavailability (F1) reaches a plateau, when the dose exceeds 1.5 mg.  
The  pop-PK  model  developed  in  study  GBGL  was  used  to  predict  changes  in  exposure  in  special 
populations, specifically in older patients and in patients with impaired kidney function. The ratios of the 
predicted post hoc PK exposures in the aforementioned special populations and the predicted population 
mean  reveal  a  slight  effect  of  higher  age  (≥75  years)  and  moderate  renal  impairment  (stage  3b; 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) on dulaglutide exposure. Due to the limited effect 
range (0.975 - 1.28), the applicant does not recommend dose adjustments. However, it is unclear, how 
dulaglutide exposure is affected by very high age, i.e. in patients ≥85 years, as this subgroup was not 
addressed in the applicant’s analysis. Study GBGL included only one patient aged 85 years at baseline, 
who was randomized to the 3.0 mg dose. As emphasized by the applicant in the response to this issue, 
only  study  GBDJ  (REWIND,  not  part  of  this  application)  included  a  considerable  number  (n=43)  of 
patients aged ≥85 years. However, the REWIND study did not address the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dose. 
Thus, the data is not considered sufficient to exclude a clinically relevant influence of an age ≥85 years 
on dulaglutide exposure after administration of the high 3.0 and 4.5 mg dose.  
The  applicant  has  additionally  presented  a  comparison  of  observed  dulaglutide  concentrations  and 
population pharmacokinetics (PK) model-predicted concentrations for the oldest group of patients (aged 
≥75 years) throughout the entire course of study GBGL and for each treatment arm. The data confirm 
that  the  majority  of  observed  PK  concentrations  in  patients  aged  ≥75  years  are  within  the  90%  PK 
prediction intervals. Thus, dose adjustment in patients aged ≥75 years is not considered necessary. 
With regard to kidney disease, the effect of stage 3b impaired kidney function on dulaglutide exposure 
is difficult to assess, as the number of patients was very low and consequently, the 90% CI is spanning 
a wide range from <1.0 to >1.5. However, the mean fold change in exposure from the reference patient 
across all eGFR categories was within the expected inter-individual dulaglutide PK variability (from 7.69% 
to 73.0%), suggesting that a potential influence of renal impairment on dulaglutide exposure may not 
become clinically relevant. Moreover, the subset of CKD stage 3b patients in study GBGL was very small 
(n=14) and about half of these patients were on the 1.5-mg dose, where no effect of kidney function on 
dulaglutide exposure is expected. In fact, after combining the stage 3b patients with the larger group of 
Stage 3a CKD patients from study GBGL, the mean fold change from the reference patient in Cmax and 
AUC  for  the  collective  group  with  moderate  renal  impairment  is  about  the  same  as  observed  in  the 
original submission for the 1.5-mg dose across the range of renal impairment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 36/117 
 
 
 
 
No patients with stage 4 kidney disease (eGFR of 15 - 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were analysed in study GBGL. 
This  population  is  specifically  important  as  Trulicity  is  explicitly  indicated,  when  metformin  cannot  be 
used,  which  includes  patients  with  stage  4  renal  impairment.  Although  patients  with  severe  kidney 
disease and end-stage renal disease have been included in studies GBCM, GBDX and GBDJ (submitted 
with the original MA application), these studies did not investigate the 3.0 mg and the 4.5 mg dose of 
dulaglutide. Nevertheless, the applicant presented an analysis, showing that PK in patients with T2DM 
and Stage 3 or 4 CKD, who received 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg of dulaglutide in study GBDX, ranges within the 
PK exposure range derived from the general phase 3 T2D patient population from studies GBCF, GBDA 
and GBDC with less renally impaired patients. It might be assumed that a clinically relevant impact of 
renal impairment on dulaglutide PK and exposure would have become visible at doses ≤1.5 mg. Although 
the validity of extrapolating these findings to the 3.0 and 4.5 mg dose strengths  may be regarded as 
somewhat controversial, it is considered unlikely that in renally impaired patients any excess exposure 
will occur. Based on theoretical considerations, an impact of renal impairment on dulaglutide exposure 
is  not  to  be  expected,  because  dulaglutide  is  metabolically  degraded  into  its  amino  acid  components 
rather than being excreted via the kidneys. 
Another subpopulation that was considered in the population PK model of study GBGL, was the group of 
patients with higher body weight. AUC(0-168)ss decreases with increasing body weight. In comparison 
to the AUC(0-168)ss in a 70 kg-patient, the AUC(0-168)ss decreases by ~20% and ~35% for persons 
with  93  kg  and  120 kg,  respectively.  This  relationship  is  similar  for  all  three  dulaglutide  doses  and 
confirms older findings reported in the initial  Trulicity EPAR (EMA/CHMP/524604/2014).  The applicant 
considers dose adjustment because of weight unnecessary, which is acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
The PK/PD simulations for study GBGJ and GBGL yield largely consistent results. Regarding HbA1c and 
fasting glucose, no patient factors were retained as covariates in the HbA1c PK/PD model in study GBGJ 
and  GBGL.  In  case  of  fasting  glucose,  in  study  GBGL,  baseline  fasting  glucose  was  associated  with 
increased  dulaglutide  EC50  plasma  concentrations.  However,  this  was  not  considered  to  be  of  clinical 
concern, because the dulaglutide concentrations after administration of 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg are 
generally expected to remain above the EC50 value.  
The  PK/PD  model  for  weight  change  was  the  same  for  study  GBGJ  and  GBGL.  Sex  was  included  as 
covariate to consider the differences in baseline body weight between male and female patients. In study 
GBGL, body weight reduction was in general more pronounced than in study GBGJ, which is most likely 
due to the longer duration of study GBGL.  
Female  patients  had  a  higher  probability  of  developing  nausea  and/or  vomiting  as  compared  to  male 
patients. In study GBGJ, a half-life of 5.03 weeks was predicted for maximum tolerance to develop, which 
was largely confirmed in study GBGL (6.2 weeks). Based on the results from study GBGJ, an up-titration 
scheme was implemented in the pivotal phase 3 study GBGL. Body weight <93 kg or ≥93 kg was identified 
as an additional covariate in study GBGL and was kept for the final model. The incidence of nausea and 
vomiting was higher in patients with lower body weight, probably due to increased dulaglutide exposure.  
In  both  studies  (GBGJ  and  GBGL),  increased  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  were  significantly 
correlated with an increased heart rate (ECG and pulse). In study GBGJ, the model-predicted increase in 
heart rate for the mean Cmax,ss of 205 ng/ml (to be expected with the 4.5 mg dose) was more than twice 
as high as the increase previously predicted for the 1.5 mg dose (2.6 bpm; reported in the initial EPAR 
EMA/CHMP/524604/2014). In study GBGL the heart rate increased during the first 18 weeks, followed by 
a decline until week 36, which indicates development of some tolerance with regard to the effect on heart 
rate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 37/117 
 
 
 
 
The  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  also  correlated  with  QTcF  interval  shortening  and  PR  interval 
prolongation, but only the correlation with PR interval prolongation reached significance in study GBGJ 
and GBGL (p<0.05). It is unclear, whether these cardiovascular effects have long-term consequences on 
cardiovascular events, as no data from cardiovascular outcome trials with the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dose of 
dulaglutide  are  available.  However,  the  effects  of  dulaglutide  on  heart  rate  (increase)  and  PR  interval 
(prolongation) were small so that a relevant increase in CV risk is unlikely. Further reassurance regarding 
CV safety can be derived from the clinical experience with the substance class. 
In  study  GBGJ,  a  significant  positive  correlation  of  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  with  pancreatic 
amylase and lipase was identified. This initial increase in pancreatic amylase and lipase was followed by 
a gradual reduction over time, but values did not completely return to baseline at the last measurement 
in week 22. By contrast, in study GBGL, the correlation was positive for p-amylase and negative for lipase 
but did not reach statistical significance. Possibly, this difference between study GBGJ and GBGL might 
be due to the different up-titration schemes (faster up-titration in study GBGJ as compared to GBGL).  
Interactions of higher dulaglutide doses with concomitantly administered oral medications  
The most important mechanism for pharmacokinetic interactions with dulaglutide is the delaying effect 
of  dulaglutide  on  gastric  emptying  and  small  intestinal  transit  time.  The  delay  in  gastric  emptying 
expected for the 4.5 mg dose was calculated by the applicant with data from older studies (GBCD and 
GBCH),  where  acetaminophen  was  concomitantly  administered  with  dulaglutide,  and  the  plasma 
concentration-time  profiles  of  both  substances  were  determined.  For  dulaglutide  as  well  as  for 
acetaminophen, pop-PK models were developed based on models previously reported in the literature. 
Both pop-PK models were linked to predict  the  influence  of  various  dulaglutide doses  on the delay of 
gastric emptying. This method is acceptable, because acetaminophen shows a PK profile that is largely 
dependent on gastric emptying and is therefore suitable as a model substance. 
After having calculated the expected delay in gastric emptying with the aforementioned acetaminophen 
model,  the  applicant  has  generated  a  PBPK  model  to  predict  dulaglutide-induced  changes  in  PK 
parameters of selected orally administered drugs. There are several assumptions underlying the PBPK 
modelling analyses. The GED ratios applied to the gastric mean residence time in Simcyp® assumed that 
the fold change was the same between healthy subjects and T2DM patients. Different gastric emptying 
times were applied for fasted and fed state, but it was assumed that the fold-change in gastric emptying 
was the same between fasted and fed states. As shown in Fig. 3, the dulaglutide plasma concentrations 
after  a  dose  of  4.5  mg  show  high  variability.  Specifically,  in  the  few  patients  that  reach  very  high 
dulaglutide concentrations, gastric emptying may be delayed by >6-fold, which may result in clinically 
relevant PK changes of co-administered drugs. Upon request  by the CHMP, the applicant reported PK 
changes assuming a 5.55-fold change in gastric mean residence time. These scenarios were considered 
unlikely by the Applicant as they were simulated under the assumption of steady state concentrations 
after 4.5 mg dosing. Treatment will be initiated with lower doses and since effect on gastric emptying is 
expected to be highest after the first dose and will be attenuated with following doses, the values are 
likely to have over-estimated the effect of dulaglutide on the exposures of concomitant oral medications. 
The resulting gastric mean residence time was 6.55 h for the fed state and 1.50 h for the fasted state. 
This  change  corresponded  to  the  95th  percentile  of  the  steady-state  maximum  plasma  concentration 
(Cmax) of dulaglutide at 243 ng/mL. Predicted changes in PK parameters were provided and did not show 
significant changes for most compounds. There was an increase in AUC and Cmax with delayed gastric 
emptying for metoprolol, which was probably due to the extended release formulation used in this case. 
For atorvastatin, however, AUC and Cmax were considerably decreased with delayed gastric emptying, in 
contrast  to  the  behavior  of  the  other  compounds.  The  strong  reduction  in  atorvastatin  Cmax  can  be 
explained  by  increased  conversion  of  atorvastatin  carboxylic  acid  to  its  inactive  lactone  form  in  the 
stomach  during  the  prolonged  gastric  residence  time.  However,  the  AUC  is  less  affected  than  Cmax, 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 38/117 
 
 
 
 
 
because the lactone form is partially back-converted to the active acid form after absorption. Moreover, 
if  the  active  metabolite  o-hydroxyatorvastatin  is  additionally  considered,  the  reduction  of  AUC  by 
dulaglutide is far less pronounced and therefore not considered clinically relevant. 
Intestinal  transit  time  was  only  included  in  the  model  for  delayed-release  metoprolol,  but  not  in  the 
models for the other substances. It can be assumed that PK of delayed-release metoprolol is specifically 
susceptible  to  changes  in  intestinal  transit  time.  Thus,  the  metoprolol  model  was  adjusted  to  predict 
correctly the effect of a given retardation of intestinal transit, which was caused by 1.5 mg dulaglutide. 
However,  it  remains  uncertain  how  valid  the  resulting  predictions  are.  It  was  not  tested  whether  the 
model also allows correct prediction for other substances with slow release or poor solubility or other 
doses of dulaglutide. 
Modelling of intestinal absorption appears challenging since it is dependent on many factors (not only 
transit time) which are difficult to access without invasive methods. It has to be assumed that a given 
prolongation  in  transit  time  affects  different  drugs  in  a  different  way,  depending  on  factors  such  as 
absorption rate through the intestinal mucosa and site of absorption within the gut. With this complexity, 
it is not clear whether existing data (e.g. the degree of prolonging the transit time by liraglutide) are 
sufficient to inform the model for reliable results. Thus, it is questionable whether the effect of 4.5 mg 
dulaglutide was predicted correctly and whether the model calculations for metoprolol are representative 
for other drugs with delayed release or with low solubility/permeability.  
It  is  further  noted  that  gastric  emptying  delay  seems  to  disappear  within  36  days  in  study  GBCH 
(acetaminophen model), but  the prevalence of nausea and vomiting with the 3.0 mg and the 4.5 mg 
dose in study GBGL does not completely return to baseline and constantly remains higher than with the 
1.5 mg dose. Thus, factors other than delayed gastric emptying, e.g. a delay in intestinal transit time, 
may contribute to these adverse events. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that potential PK interactions 
resolve within the same period as the interactions caused by delayed gastric emptying.  
Both,  over-  and  under-predictions  of  Cmax  occurred  with  the  applicant’s  PBPK  models.  In  case  of 
acetaminophen, which had been used to estimate the dulaglutide-induced delay in gastric emptying, a 
comparison of the observed and predicted concentrations with and without dulaglutide indicates that the 
model did not well capture the high Cmax values. Nevertheless, prediction corrected VPCs show that the 
ability of the PBPK model to describe central tendency and variability of the data is acceptable. 
For some of the substances modelled with the applicant’s PBPK model, the predicted influence of 4.5 mg 
dulaglutide is considerably higher than the interactions reported in the current version of the SmPC. For 
example, for digoxin, the SmPC states that Cmax is decreased by dulaglutide by up to 22%, but the new 
predictions for the 4.5 mg dulaglutide dose yield a decrease by 34%. Similarly, the SmPC mentions a 
reduction  of  Cmax  of  co-administered  norelgestromine  end  ethinylestradiol  by  -26%  and  -13%, 
respectively, while the PBPK model predicts -51% (norelgestromin) and -44% (ethinylestradiol). In case 
of  metoprolol,  the  SmPC  mentions  a  dulaglutide-induced  increase  in  AUC  by  19%,  but  the  predicted 
increase in AUC for the 4.5 mg dose is 35%.  
In  summary,  interactions  between  the  higher  strengths  of  dulaglutide  and  several  concomitantly 
administered  oral  drugs  were  only  predicted  based  on  PBPK  modeling,  but  no  clinical  drug-drug 
interaction study was performed. This is sufficiently addressed in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The study GBGM has successfully bridged the two methods of dulaglutide administration in study GBGJ 
(3x1.5 mg in pre-filled syringe) and GBGL (1x4.5 mg in single-dose pen). Both ways of administration 
can be considered bioequivalent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 39/117 
 
 
 
 
The pop-PK simulations in study GBGJ and GBGL suggest that bioequivalence of dulaglutide is not altered 
for  3.0 mg and 4.0 mg as compared to the 1.5 mg dose,  although  a reduction in  bioequivalence had 
been previously reported, when the dose was increased from 0.75 mg to 1.5 mg. An almost proportional 
increase of AUC and Cmax was found for increasing doses of dulaglutide.  
The pop-PK model in study GBGL suggested increased dulaglutide exposure in patients aged ≥ 75 years 
and  in  patients  with  stage  3B  chronic  kidney  disease.  Moreover,  the  model  predicted  an  inverse 
relationship  between  body  weight  and  dulaglutide.  As  discussed  in  the  preceding  section,  no  dose 
adjustments for very high age and severe kidney disease are currently recommended.  
The  PK/PD  simulations  for  study  GBGJ  and  GBGL  yielded  largely  consistent  results.  In  study  GBGL, 
baseline fasting glucose was associated with increased dulaglutide EC50 plasma concentrations, but clinical 
relevance is limited, as the dulaglutide plasma concentrations after administration of 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg or 
4.5 mg are generally expected to remain above the EC50 value.  
Female  patients  had  a  higher  probability  of  developing  nausea  and/or  vomiting  as  compared  to  male 
patients. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher in patients with lower body weight, probably 
due to increased dulaglutide exposure. In both studies (GBGJ and GBGL), increased dulaglutide plasma 
concentrations  were  significantly  correlated  with  an  increased  heart  rate.  This  effect  declined  in  study 
GBGL  after  week  18.  The  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  were  also  correlated  with  QTcF  interval 
shortening and PR interval prolongation, but only the correlation with PR interval prolongation reached 
significance. It is currently unclear, whether long-term consequences on cardiovascular health may occur 
with the 3.0 mg and the 4.5 mg dose of dulaglutide. However, the effects of dulaglutide on heart rate 
(increase)  and  PR  interval  (prolongation)  were  small  so  that  a  relevant  increase  in  CV  risk  is  unlikely. 
Further reassurance regarding CV safety can be derived from the clinical experience with the substance 
class.  The  correlation  of  dulaglutide  plasma  concentrations  with  pancreatic  amylase  and  lipase  was 
inconsistent between study GBGJ and GBGL. This may be partially due to different up-titration schemes.  
Based on previous data with the model drug acetaminophen, the applicant has developed a PKPB model 
to  predict  the  interaction  of  4.5  mg  of  dulaglutide  with  the  PK  of  selected  oral  drugs.  The  predicted 
changes in AUC and/or Cmax were considered clinically irrelevant.

Study Design 
Study H9X-MC-GBGJ (GBGJ) is a randomized, multi-centre, outpatient, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
Phase 2 trial in patients with T2DM on metformin monotherapy. The study was designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of once weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg in comparison to placebo. In 
addition,  the  trial  explored  how  the  two  new  higher  dose  strengths  dulaglutide  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg 
compared  to  the  approved  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  dose.  The  study  consisted  of  3  periods:  a  2-week 
screening/lead-in period, an 18-week treatment period (the first 6 weeks were a titration phase for the 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg groups), and a 4-week safety follow-up period. Patients randomized to 
placebo or dulaglutide 1.5 mg were treated with those doses beginning at Week 0 for all 18 weeks of the 
treatment phase. Patients randomized to dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg were titrated over the 6 weeks 
of the titration phase as follows (in each of these groups, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 
of the dosing algorithms). Patients randomized to up-titration algorithm A1 received dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
once  weekly  for  the  first  4  weeks  followed  by  dulaglutide  3.0  mg  once  weekly  for  the  next  2  weeks; 
patients randomized to up-titration algorithm A2 received dulaglutide 0.75 mg once weekly for the first 
2 weeks followed by dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly for the next 4 weeks. Thereafter, patients received 
the full randomized dose for the remaining treatment period of the study.

The study consisted of 3 periods: a 2-week screening/lead-in period, an 18-week treatment period (the 
first 6 weeks were a titration phase for the dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg groups), and a 4-week 
safety follow-up period.  
Study treatments 
−  Study Drug: Dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg given subcutaneously once weekly administered via 
prefilled syringe 
−  Comparator Treatment: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg given subcutaneously once weekly administered via 
prefilled syringe; Placebo given subcutaneously once weekly administered via prefilled syringe  
Dose selection 
The  dulaglutide  investigational  doses  of  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg  once-weekly  were  selected  for  initial 
evaluation  in  Phase  2  Study  GBGJ  based  on  (a)  simulations  that  included  data  collected  in  previous 
studies  (Barrington  et  al.  2011;  Skrivanek  et  al.  2014)  suggesting  that  these  doses  may  provide 
incremental clinically relevant reductions in Hb1Ac and body weight in comparison to the 1.5 mg dose, 
and  (b)  adequate  separation  in  the  PK  exposure  range  between  the  doses  and  1.5  mg  to  enable 
evaluation of their efficacy and adverse effect profiles.  
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures 
Primary Endpoint 
To demonstrate that once weekly dulaglutide (4.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 1.5 mg) is superior to placebo in glycated 
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction from baseline to Week 18 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
on concomitant metformin monotherapy. The primary analysis of the primary outcome measure excluded 
post-rescue data. 
A  post-hoc  supportive  sensitivity  analysis  which  excluded  data  post-rescue  and  post  study  drug 
discontinuation was added to further evaluate the effect of the study drugs on relevant efficacy measures 
while patients were on treatment. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Efficacy 
Each dulaglutide arm (4.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 1.5 mg) was compared to the placebo arm at 18 weeks for the 
following secondary efficacy parameters: 
• proportion of patients achieving HbA1c target <7.0% (53 mmol/mol); 
• change in fasting serum glucose (FSG; central laboratory) from baseline; 
• change in body weight from baseline. 
Safety 
Each dulaglutide arm (4.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 1.5 mg) was compared to the placebo arm at 18 weeks for the 
following secondary safety parameters: 
• treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); 
• discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events (AEs); 
• incidence and rate of hypoglycaemia (severe, total, documented symptomatic, and nocturnal). 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
The secondary pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) objectives were to characterize the PK of 
dulaglutide and establish the relationships between dose/exposure and key safety and efficacy 
measures: 
• PK parameters (e.g. maximum concentration [Cmax], area under the curve [AUC]); 
• PD evaluations included FSG, HbA1c, body weight, Fridericia’s corrected QT interval (QTcF), and 
heart rate (HR).

Concomitant Therapy 
Patients were to be permitted to use concomitant medications that they required during the study, 
except certain medications that may have interfered with the assessment of efficacy and safety 
characteristics of the study treatments (see table below).  
Criteria for Use of Concomitant Medications and Rescue Therapy 
Statistical methods 
Patients were randomly assigned to in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (stratified by country and HbA1c level) to the four 
treatment  arms  and  within  the  two  higher  dose  arms  1:1  randomization  to  two  different  treatment 
algorithms was conducted. 
A  total  sample  size  of  300  patients  was  planned  to  achieve  a  power  of  provide  ≥ 90%  power  to 
demonstrate superiority for the dulaglutide doses to placebo with respect to primary endpoint (assumed 
treatment effect of -1% HBA1c, standard deviation of 1.2%, alpha=0.05 and 20% dropout). 
Efficacy  and  safety  analyses  will  be  conducted  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomized 
patients taking at least one dose of study medication) by censoring all post-rescue data. As not all patient 
directly  switched  to  rescue  treatment  following  treatment  discontinuation,  post-hoc  analyses  were 
conducted excluding data post-rescue or post discontinuation of study drug. As sensitivity analysis, the 
Assessment report

primary  endpoint  was  also  evaluated  in  per  protocol  population,  completer  population  and  the  ITT 
population including post-rescue data. 
A  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  analysis  was  used  to  analyze  continuous  longitudinal 
variables. The corresponding baseline value will be used as a covariate, and the stratification factors, 
treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction will be fixed effects. For HbA1c analyses, the HbA1c 
strata will be removed. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-patient errors.  
For  percentages  of  patients  achieving  HbA1c  targets,  a  longitudinal  logistic  regression  with  repeated 
measurements with similar covariates was used. Non-longitudinal endpoints were analyzed by means of 
an ANCOVA model applying last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation to handle missing data. 
Multiplicity  control  was  not  conducted.  For  an  exploratory  phase  2  study  the  analyses  are  overall 
considered acceptable. 
Results 
Patient Disposition and Sample Size 
A total of 505 patients were screened and 318 patients were randomized to treatment (see Figure below). 
One patient randomized to placebo withdrew consent to participate in the study prior to receiving study 
drug. Therefore, 317 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and comprised the ITT population 
(placebo, 81; dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 81; dulaglutide 3.0 mg, 79; dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 76). 
a One patient was randomized but not treated. 
b Three patients were discontinued from study drug before Week 18 and later from the study (before Week 18). 
c One patient was discontinued from study drug before Week 18 and from the study at Week 18. 
d One patient discontinued at the Safety Follow-up visit. 
e Indicates completed study through Safety Follow-up Period, regardless of duration of study treatment. 
f One patient completed the treatment period through Week 18 but did not return for Visit 801 at the end of the 
Safety Follow-up Period.

A  total  of  318  patients  were  randomized  and  292  (91.8%)  completed  the  study  through  the  Safety 
Follow-up Period (regardless of duration of treatment with study drug); 48 of 318 randomized patients 
(15.1%) discontinued from study treatment before Week 18 (patients who stopped study drug before 
Week  18  with  or  without  stopping  the  study):  Placebo,  11  (13.4%);  dulaglutide  1.5  mg,  9  (11.1%); 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg, 10 (12.7%); dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 18 (23.7%). Adverse event was the most frequent 
reason  for  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (21  of  318  randomized  patients  [6.6%])  with  more  patients 
discontinuing study drug for AEs at the two higher doses dulaglutide 3.0 mg, 7 (8.9%) and 4.5 mg, 8 
(10.5%) and less patients discontinuing study drug for AEs at placebo, 3 (3.7%) and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 
3 (3.7%).

Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  in  the  ITT  population  were  comparable  between  treatment 
groups.  The  mean  age  was  56.8  years.  The  majority  of  patients  were  White  77.0%  and  50.2%  were 
female. The mean HbA1c was 8.1% and the mean duration of T2D was 8.0 years. The mean body weight 
was 91.9 kg. The overall comparison of baseline body weight across the 4 treatment groups was slightly 
different (p=0.032); the mean body weight was lower in the dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg groups (87.9 
and 89.1 kg, respectively) and higher in the placebo and dulaglutide 3.0 mg groups (94.5 and 96.0 kg, 
respectively).  The  mean  BMI  was  33.0  kg/m2;  the  overall  comparison  of  baseline  BMI  across  the  4 
treatment  groups  was  also  of  borderline  significance  (p=0.046).  The  slight  differences  at  baseline 
observed for body weight and BMI across study groups are not judged as having exerted a meaningful 
impact on the reliability of the GBGJ study results.  
At screening (Visit 1) and at baseline (Visit 3) all patients in the ITT Population were receiving metformin 
(median  dose  of  2000  mg/day  in  all  treatment  groups)  and  no  patients  were  receiving  oral  anti-
hyperglycemia agents other than metformin. 
A  total  of  9  patients  received  rescue  medication  due  to  severe,  persistent  hyperglycemia  during  the 
treatment period, as anticipated more patients in the placebo group 6 (7.4%) than in the dulaglutide 
treatment arms [1.5 mg, 1 (1.2%); 3.0 mg, 1 (1.3%); 4.5 mg, 1 (1.3%)]. 
The use of concomitant medications after randomization was not significantly different from the use at 
baseline. The most frequent concomitant medications  were antihypertensives (70.3% at baseline and 
71.3% after randomization), lipid-lowering agents (45.1% at baseline and 49.5% after randomization) 
and anti-thrombotic agents (23.7% at baseline and 25.9% after randomization) with comparable use of 
concomitant medications between treatment groups. 
Compliance 
Overall,  96.8%  of  patients  were  evaluated  by  the  investigator  to  be  compliant  with  injectable  study 
medication (having received at least 75% of doses of placebo or dulaglutide over at least 75% of visits). 
Over the entire treatment period through Week 18, overall compliance (mean [SD]) with injectable study 
medication  (placebo  or  dulaglutide)  was  97.3%  (10.4%).  There  were  no  significant  differences  in 
compliance among the 4 treatment groups at any time point. 
Protocol Deviations 
A  total  of  33  randomized  patients  (10.4%)  were  excluded  from  the  PP  Population  due  to  important 
protocol  deviations.  The  most  frequent  deviations  were  not  completing  the  treatment  period,  Lab/ 
Imaging Criteria or missing HbA1c at baseline and/or Week 18. 
A  total  of  63  randomized  patients  (19.8%)  had  other  important  deviations  which  did  not  result  in 
exclusion from the PP Population; 58 patients had deviations related to study sites being late obtaining 
reconsent with an Informed Consent Form (ICF) which was amended during the study due to a change 
in the IB resulting in this most frequently reported protocol deviation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 49/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The protocol  deviations were not likely  to have significantly  affected  the  analyses of  the GBGJ  study. 
This conclusion is supported by results of changes from baseline in HbA1c conducted in the PP Population 
that were consistent with the results of the analyses in the ITT Population. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 study GBGJ was to demonstrate that once weekly dulaglutide (1.5 
mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) is superior to placebo in HbA1c reduction at Week 18 in patients with T2D on 
concomitant  metformin  monotherapy.  The  mean  HbA1c  values  (SD)  at  baseline  were  comparable 
between dulaglutide and placebo treatment groups. 
Primary Analysis: HbA1c (%) from Baseline to Week 18, Intent-to-Treat Population without 
Post-Rescue Values 
HbA1c (%) from Baseline to Week 18, Intent-to-Treat Population 
The primary objective was met as all three doses of dulaglutide (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) reduced 
HbA1c significantly from baseline to Week 18 compared to placebo (p<0.001). 
However, the two new higher investigational dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) did not 
improve  HbA1c  significantly  from  baseline  compared  to  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  at  Week  18  and  the 
magnitude of the observed HbA1c reductions was small.

In the primary analysis (ITT population without post-rescue values) of study GBGJ, the LSM differences 
(95% CI) of dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg at Week 18 were -0.08%, p=0.572 
and -0.16%, p=0.235, respectively. 
Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Endpoint  
A post hoc supportive “on-treatment without rescue” analysis which excluded data post-rescue and post 
study drug discontinuation was added to further evaluate the effect of the study medications on relevant 
efficacy measures while patients were on treatment. 
The Table below presents this supportive “on-treatment analysis” of the primary endpoint (without post-
rescue  or  post  discontinued  IP  values),  which  is  claimed  by  the  applicant  as  a  key  prerequisite  for 
understanding the true effect of the various dulaglutide doses on HbA1c. 
HbA1c (%) from Baseline to Week 18, On-Treatment Analysis (excluding post-rescue and 
post discontinued IP values) 
At Week 18, the differences on HbA1c (%) observed between dulaglutide and placebo were numerically 
greater in the supportive sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint excluding data post-rescue and 
post study drug discontinuation; the LSM differences (95% CI) of dulaglutide 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus 
placebo at 18 weeks were −0.82%, −1.04% and −1.08%, respectively; all p-values < 0.001.  
The LSM differences (95% CI) of dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg at 
18  weeks  were  also  more  pronounced  -0.22%,  p=0.088  and  -0.26%,  p=0.051,  but  did  not  reach 
statistical significance; the observed HbA1c reductions were not >0.3% what is defined by the diabetes 
guideline (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 2) as a clinically meaningful effect size.

The two new investigational dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) did not significantly 
improve the primary endpoint [HbA1c (%) change from baseline to Week 18] compared to dulaglutide 
1.5 mg across all subgroup analyses (except for the subgroup White, where borderline statistical 
significance was achieved for dulaglutide 4.5 mg versus placebo, p=0.049).

The percentages of patients achieving target HbA1c <7.0% at Week 18 were significantly greater in all 
three dulaglutide groups (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) compared to placebo-treated patients. However, 
the  percentages  of  patients  achieving  target  HbA1c  <7.0%  at  Week  18  were  comparable  and  not 
significantly different between the dulaglutide groups.

Title of Study 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Arm Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Investigational 
Dulaglutide Doses When Added to Metformin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of once-weekly dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg, or both compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 36 
in patients with inadequately controlled T2D on concomitant metformin therapy. 
The primary objective was separately assessed using two estimands, termed an “efficacy estimand” and 
a  “treatment-regimen  estimand”.  For  the  efficacy  estimand,  analyses  excluded  data  after  premature 
treatment  discontinuation  or  initiation  of  new  antihyperglycemic  therapy  for  more  than  14  days 
(whichever occurred first). For the treatment-regimen estimand, the analyses included all data collected 
before and after initiation of new antihyperglycemic therapy, premature treatment discontinuation (or 
both), with Week 36 missing data imputed using a retrieved drop-out approach.

Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
The two new higher dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg or 4.5 mg s.c. once-weekly) were administered 
via single-dose pen. All patients randomized to one of the investigational dose groups initiated treatment 
with dulaglutide 0.75 mg once-weekly for 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg once-weekly for 4 weeks and then 
3.0 mg once-weekly for 4 weeks. Thereafter, patients randomized to the 3.0 mg group were maintained

on this dose for the remainder of the treatment period whereas patient randomized to the 4.5 mg group 
had their dose increased to 4.5 mg once-weekly after 4 weeks of treatment with 3.0 mg once-weekly. 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
The approved dose strength of dulaglutide (1.5 mg s.c. once-weekly) was administered via single-dose 
pen.  All  patients  were  initiated  on  treatment  with  dulaglutide  0.75  mg  once-weekly  for  4  weeks. 
Thereafter,  the  dose  of  dulaglutide  was  increased  to  1.5  mg  once-weekly  and  maintained  for  the 
remainder of the treatment period. 
Duration of Treatment 
36 weeks for primary endpoint database lock; 52 weeks for final database lock. 
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures

dulaglutide 3.0 mg, or both versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 36 in 
patients with inadequately controlled T2D on concomitant metformin therapy. 
The  primary  and  all  secondary  efficacy  outcome  measures  were  separately  assessed  using  two 
estimands, termed an “efficacy estimand” and a “treatment-regimen estimand” (for details please refer

Randomization 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to dulaglutide 4.5 mg, dulaglutide 3.0 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 
mg. Randomization will be stratified by country and HbA1c (<8.5% [69 mmol/mol], ≥8.5% [69 mmol/mol]). 
Blinding 
This is a double-blind study. Investigators, site staff, clinical monitors and patients will remain blinded to 
the treatment assignments until the study is complete. To preserve the blinding of the study, the Sponsor 
will be blinded to treatment assignments until after the primary endpoint (Week 36) database lock. 
Target of estimation (Estimand) 
Two different strategies (estimands) to handle intercurrent events are specified. Relevant intercurrent 
events  are  premature 
treatment  discontinuation  (untreated  afterwards), 
initiation  of  new 
antihyperglycemic  agent  (with  discontinuation  of  study  treatment)  and  use  of  rescue  medication/new 
antihyperglycemic  agent  on  top  of  study  treatment.    [Only  few  patients  (14.7%)  had  an  intercurrent 
event  up  until  week  36  and  distribution  was  similar  across  treatment  arms.    8.7%,  4.0%  and  2.0% 
discontinued treatment completely, initiated new antihyperglycemic medications without discontinuing 
treatment and switched from study treatment to new anti-hyperglycaemic medications, respectively.] 
The ‘efficacy estimand’ (primary estimand for EU; also referred to as ‘’on-treatment without initiation of 
new  antihyperglycemic  medications”)  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  strategy  targeting  the  effect  if  all 
patients  had  continued  study  treatment  as  planned  and  rescue  medication/other  antihyperglycemic 
agents  had  not  been  available.  For  this  estimand,  data  collected  after  initiation  of  any  new 
antihyperglycemic  medication  for  more  than  14  days  or  premature  treatment  discontinuation  are 
excluded. 
The  ‘treatment  regimen  estimand’  (primary  for  US  FDA),  is  based  on  a  treatment  policy  strategy 
targeting  the  effect  regardless  of  treatment  discontinuation  and  use  of  rescue  medication/other 
antihyperglycemic agents. Data collected after initiation of other antihyperglycemic therapy and/or after 
premature treatment discontinuation will be used. 
While it is agreed that both estimands can be tested at the full alpha level of 0.05 (efficacy estimand is 
specified as primary for EU), the treatment regimen estimand is considered of less regulatory relevance 
due to being blurred by the effect of alternative antihyperglycemic agents/rescue medication. 
Definition of the primary estimand (the ‘efficacy estimand’) is in part agreed. While targeting the effect 
if rescue medication/other antihyperglycemic agents had not been available is considered reasonable, 
use of a treatment policy strategy is considered of higher relevance for discontinuation of study treatment 
(in  particular  if  treatment  is  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events).  Hence,  the  estimand  targeting  the 
effect  regardless  of  treatment  discontinuation  and  had  rescue  medication  or  other  antihyperglycemic 
agents not been available is considered of higher relevance as it takes the issue of drug tolerability into 
account. This estimand is in line with the draft guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in 
the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 2), and it is similar to the 
pre-specified primary ‘efficacy estimand’, but differs in the handling of true treatment discontinuation 
and  switching  from  study  treatment  to  new  antihyperglycemic  agent  due  to  AEs.  Additional  analyses 
targeting the newly described estimand were provided. However, (1) as results for all three estimands 
are consistent (similar dose-relating effects for all) and in line with incremental effect of other antidiabetic 
medications for which several doses are approved , (2)  as the newly proposed estimand may actually 
overestimate the effect of drug tolerability (because all treatment discontinuations regardless of reason 
are accounted for) and (3) as there are some issues with estimation  of the newly proposed estimand 
(see  below),  it  is  agreed  to  primarily  report  results  of    the  pre-specified  primary  efficacy  estimand. 
Therefore, also no detailed results of the newly proposed estimand are reported in this document.

Sample size 
A sample size of 600 patients per group will provided ≥80% power to demonstrate superiority of at least 
one of the investigational dulaglutide doses (4.5 mg or 3.0 mg) to dulaglutide 1.5 mg with respect to the 
primary endpoint, assuming a 15% dropout rate and a treatment effect of -0.22% (standard deviation of 
1.1%) for either of the investigational doses (two-sided alpha  of 0.05). 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis were based on the ITT population (all randomized patients receiving at least one dose 
of study treatment).  Still, patients without baseline assessment were excluded from analyses using the 
treatment-regimen estimand and patients without baseline or without post-baseline assessments will be 
excluded from analysis using the efficacy estimand. This is generally not agreed.  However, additional 
analyses  were  provided  that  support  the  conclusion  that  no  relevant  bias  was  introduced  by  the 
exclusions. 
The pre-specified efficacy estimand analysis for the primary endpoint and other longitudinal continuous 
endpoints (change from baseline to week 36 in HbA1c, body weight and FSG) employed a mixed-model 
repeated  measurements  (MMRM)  included  factors  for  treatment,  pooled  country,  visit,  treatment-by-
visit interaction, and baseline as a covariate.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model 
the within-patient errors. For analyses of body weight and FSG, the baseline HbA1c stratum (≥8.5% [69 
mmol/mol] and <8.5%) was added to this model as a fixed effect. The proportion of patients achieving 
target  HbA1c  <7.0%  at  Week  36  was  analyzed  using  a  longitudinal  logistic  regression  with  repeated 
measurements using the same covariates as for the MMRM analysis. While the covariates included and 
the data included (only on-treatment data) are acceptable for the efficacy estimand, , further sensitivity 
analyses were requested (in addition to the ones listed below) to assess robustness of results with regard 
to deviations from the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption underlying the MMRM and the longitudinal 
logistic  regression.  As  a  potentially  conservative  missing  data  handling  approach  analyses  using 
reference-based  imputations  (jump  to  reference  and  copy  reference)  were  conducted  for  the  efficacy 
estimand. These analyses yield smaller effect estimates as compared to the primary analysis but overall 
support  the  robustness  of  results.  Such  analyses  can  also  be  interpreted  as  addressing  the  above 
discussed estimand of  higher regulatory  interest if data collected after true treatment discontinuation 
are included. Corresponding analyses for the newly proposed estimand were provided and results were 
overall  consistent  with  results  for  the  other  estimands.  Still,  it  has  to  be  considered  that  jump-to-
reference (J2R) imputation is usually applied in placebo-controlled trials and then aligned to the newly 
proposed estimand, as imputations following treatment discontinuation reflect the effect of ‘no treatment’ 
(mimicked by the placebo arm).  Nevertheless,  J2R-based imputation was considered as a potentially 
conservative approach to estimate treatment effects (i.e. difference between treatment arms) for the 
newly  proposed  estimand  in  this  active  controlled  trial,  although  estimated  average  changes  from 
baseline  within  each  treatment  arm  can  be  difficult  to  interpret.    The  treatment-regimen  estimand 
analysis for the primary endpoint and other longitudinal continuous endpoints employed an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model applied to multiply imputed data (1000 imputations). Missing Week 36 data 
were imputed based on measurements from patients with the same treatment group, the same status 
of premature treatment discontinuation (yes, no) and measured (primary) Week 36 endpoint data. The 
ANCOVA  included  pooled  country  and  treatment  as  fixed  effects,  and  baseline  as  a  covariate  and 
inference  was  based  on  pooled  estimates.  For  analyses  of  body  weight  and  FSG,  the  baseline  HbA1c 
stratum  was  added  to  this  model  as  a  fixed  effect.  There  are  some  issues  with  this  analysis  (not 
completely  pre-specified  and  status  ‘other  antihyperglycemic  medication  (yes/no)’  is  not  considered), 
which are not considered of further concern, as the treatment regimen estimand is considered of less 
regulatory  relevance.  For  the  treatment-regimen  estimand  and  the  HbA1c  target  <7.0%  endpoint,  a 
logistic regression model was fit to the complete data (missing data imputed as non-response). Pooled 
country and treatment were included as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.

In  order  to  assess  the  robustness  of  results  for  the  primary/secondary  endpoints,  several 
sensitivity/supplementary  analyses  were  conducted.  Per-protocol  and  completers  populations  were 
evaluated separately using the same MMRM model as described above. Data collected after initiation of 
new  antihyperglycemic  medications, 
treatment  discontinuation,  or  both  was  excluded. 
Primary/secondary  endpoints  were  analyzed  using  an  analysis  of  covariance  model  (continuous 
endpoints) or logistic regression (binary endpoints) using on-treatment data and last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) imputation.  The logistic regression model was also applied (1) counting patients who 
initiated new antihyperglycemic medications, discontinued, or both prior to Week 36 as not achieving 
HbA1c target and (2) to the multiply imputed complete dataset (see above).  
Multiplicity was properly controlled across the primary and secondary endpoints based on the following 
graphical procedure. Adjusted p-values and simultaneous confidence intervals in line with the graphical 
procedure  were  provided  for  the  pre-specified  MMRM  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  estimand,  and 
adjusted p-value information is reported in the SmPC. 
Results  
Patient Disposition and Sample Size 
The  GBGL  study  was  conducted  at  203  study  centers  in  15  countries.  Date  of  first  patient  enrolled 
(assigned to therapy) was 19 April 2018 and date of last patient completed Week 36 was 28 May 2019. 
A total of 2739 patients were screened and 1842 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, received 
at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug,  and  were  included  in  the  ITT  population  (dulaglutide  1.5  mg,  N=612; 
dulaglutide  3.0  mg,  N=616;  dulaglutide  4.5  mg,  N=614).  Of  the  897  patients  not  randomized,  the 
majority (93.1%) were screen failures because they did not meet protocol entry criteria. 
A total of 1842 patients were randomized and 1717 (93.2%) completed the Week 36 primary endpoint 
visit; 1645 of 1842 randomized patients (89.3%) completed the Week 36 primary endpoint visit on study 
drug. There were no significant differences across dulaglutide dose groups in the proportion of patients 
discontinuing the study (p=0.533) or study drug (p=0.623) prior to Week 36. The most frequent reason 
for premature discontinuation of study drug was due to AE (4.9%) and was similar for dulaglutide 1.5 
mg (4.2%), dulaglutide 3.0 mg (5.5%) and dulaglutide 4.5 mg (5.0%) (p=0.593).

Summary and Analysis of Patient Demographics and Clinical Characteristics at Baseline, 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
The distribution of patients by age group and dulaglutide dose is presented in the following table: 
Per protocol, all patients were taking metformin at baseline. Metformin dose was similar across the three 
dulaglutide  dose  groups  (median  daily  dose,  2000  mg).  Only  1  patient  was  receiving  any  other 
antihyperglycaemic medication at baseline. This patient was treated with insulin for hyperglycemia 
considered by the investigator to require emergent treatment (allowed per protocol), beginning 
3 days prior to randomization and ending on the day of randomization. 
The most common antihyperglycemic medications (other than metformin) reported during the 36-week 
treatment period (Visit 3 to Visit 9) were SGLT-2 inhibitors (3.9%), sulfonylureas (2.0%), and insulin 
(1.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 63/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 91 patients (4.9%) received rescue medication due to severe, persistent hyperglycemia during 
the treatment period with no significant difference in the dulaglutide treatment arms [1.5 mg, 31 (5.1%); 
3.0 mg, 29 (4.7%); 4.5 mg, 31 (5.0%)]. 
The use of concomitant medications after randomization was similar to the use at baseline. The most 
frequent  concomitant  medications  were  antihypertensives  (70.7%  at  baseline  and  72.1%  after 
randomization),  lipid-lowering  agents  (55.0%  at  baseline  and  58.0%  after  randomization)  and  anti-
thrombotic agents (27.6% at baseline and 29.6% after randomization). 
Compliance 
Patients were allowed under the protocol to temporarily interrupt and then resume study drug. 
The number of patients with at least 1 study drug interruption reported due to an AE was similar across 
the  dulaglutide  dose  groups  (1.5  mg,  17  patients  [2.8%];  3.0  mg,  21  patients  [3.4%];  4.5  mg,  18 
patients  [2.9%]).  Over  the  entire  treatment  period  through  Week  36,  95.4%  of  patients  in  the  ITT 
population were evaluated by the investigator to be compliant with injectable study medication (having 
received at least 75% of doses of dulaglutide for at least 75% of visits). 
Protocol Deviations 
The  most  common  category  of  protocol  deviation  was  related  to  informed  consent  (6.7%).  Protocol 
deviations related to informed consent were primarily categorized as “lost or late consent” which was 
most often caused by patients not signing an updated ICF on the next scheduled study visit. All patients 
eventually signed the most recent, approved version of the ICF. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this study was to demonstrate superiority of once-weekly dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg, or both versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 36 in 
patients with inadequately controlled T2D on concomitant metformin therapy. 
The  primary  and  all  secondary  efficacy  outcome  measures  were  separately  assessed  using  two 
estimands, termed an “efficacy estimand” and a “treatment-regimen estimand”: 
− 
For  the  efficacy  estimand,  analyses  excluded  data  after  premature  treatment  discontinuation  or 
initiation of new antihyperglycemic therapy for more than 14 days (whichever occurred first). 
− 
For  the  treatment-regimen  estimand,  the  analyses  included  all  data  collected  before  and  after 
initiation  of  new  antihyperglycemic  therapy,  premature  treatment  discontinuation  (or  both),  with 
Week 36 missing data imputed using a retrieved drop-out approach.

*Per-Protocol (PP) Population included all patients of the ITT population who met all of the following 
criteria: 
−  had no important protocol deviation that impacted the assessment of the primary endpoint; 
completed the Treatment Period through 36 weeks (Visit 9); 
− 
−  had a value of the primary efficacy measure (HbA1c) at Week 36 (Visit 9). 
Summary and Analysis of HbA1c (%) from Baseline to Week 36, Completers Population** 
**Completers Population included all patients in the ITT population who had an HbA1c measure at 
Week 36 (Visit 9), regardless of compliance with the protocol, initiation of new antihyperglycemic 
medications, or treatment discontinuation. 
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint (changes from baseline to Week 36 in HbA1c) were 
conducted in the PP Population and Completers Population. Results of each of the supportive analyses 
were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy Measures 
Secondary  efficacy  measures  were  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  once-weekly  dulaglutide  4.5  mg, 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg, or both compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg at 36 weeks for change from baseline in 
body weight, proportion of patients achieving HbA1c target <7.0%, and change from baseline in fasting 
serum  glucose  (mg/dL).  As  for  the  primary  endpoint,  two  estimands  were  used  to  compare  the 
dulaglutide  dose  groups  for  the  secondary  efficacy  measures:  an  efficacy  estimand  and  a  treatment-
regimen estimand.

Proportion of Patients Achieving HbA1c Target <7.0% at Week 36 
Using the efficacy estimand, the percent of patients achieving an HbA1c <7% by dulaglutide dose group 
were for dulaglutide 1.5 mg: 57.0%, for dulaglutide 3.0 mg: 64.7% (odds ratio [95% CI] versus 1.5

Both investigational doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) were superior to the 1.5 mg dose in the 
secondary efficacy objective of percent of patients achieving HbA1c <7% using the efficacy estimand: 
More patients achieved an HbA1c<7% at Week 36 with dulaglutide 4.5 mg 71.5% (odds ratio [95% CI] 
versus 1.5 mg=2.23 [1.65, 3.01]; p<0.001) and dulaglutide 3.0 mg 64.7% (odds ratio [95% CI] versus 
1.5 mg=1.49 [1.12, 1.98], p=0.006) compared to the 1.5 mg dose (57%). 
Using the treatment-regimen estimand, percent of patients achieving an HbA1c <7% at Week 36 were 
62.2%, 55.8% and 49.7% for dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. 
Although the nominal p-value (not adjusted for multiplicity) was <0.001 for dulaglutide 4.5 mg vs 1.5 
mg and 0.026 for the 3.0 mg vs 1.5 mg comparison, these results were not statistically significant based 
on the graphical testing approach used to control for type I error. 
Change in Fasting Serum Glucose (mg/dL) from Baseline to Week 36 
Using the efficacy estimand, the LS mean changes in fasting serum glucose from baseline to Week 36 
were -44.2 mg/dL, -47.9 mg/dL, and -52.3 mg/dL for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg. 
The mean treatment difference was -8.1 mg/dL (p<0.001) between dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 1.5 mg and

The  secondary  efficacy  measure  of  superiority  over  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  for  change  in  fasting  serum 
glucose from baseline to Week 36 was met with the dulaglutide 4.5 mg dose for the efficacy estimand 
(-8.1  mg/dL,  p<0.001)  but  not  the  treatment-regimen  estimand  (-6.4  mg/dL,  nominal  p=0.009,  not

A significant treatment-by-sex interaction was observed for the primary endpoint of change in HbA1c 
using the efficacy estimand. For female patients, the LS mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 
36 were:  
-1.52%,  -1.70%  and  -2.01%  for  dulaglutide  1.5  mg,  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg,  respectively  and  for  male 
patients: -1.56%, -1.71% and -1.73%.The treatment-by-sex interaction was due primarily to a greater 
LS mean decrease in HbA1c in the dulaglutide 4.5 mg group in females versus males, whereas change 
in  HbA1c was comparable between  females and males for  both the 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg dose groups. 
According to the applicant, this interaction may have been a chance finding, as there was no significant 
treatment-by-sex interaction effect on the change in HbA1c in any of the AWARD studies included in the 
original dulaglutide submission, and there is no known biological mechanism by which GLP-1 RA would 
be expected to have inherently different efficacy in females versus males with T2D.

For patients with baseline HbA1c <8.5%, the LS mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 36 were: 
-1.16%, -1.38% and -1.38% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively and for patients 
with baseline HbA1c ≥8.5%: -1.89%, -2.02% and -2.34%.  
The treatment-by-subgroup interaction for the primary endpoint of HbA1c was significant (p=0.020) for 
baseline HbA1c (<8.5% or ≥8.5%). The significant interaction appeared largely driven by the greater LS 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c in the 4.5 mg dose groups versus 1.5 mg dose in patients with 
baseline  HbA1c  ≥8.5%.  Although  the  treatment-by-subgroup  interaction  for  the  primary  endpoint  of 
HbA1c was not significant (p=0.116) for baseline HbA1c <8% or ≥8%, a similar pattern was observed: 
the LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c was greater in the 4.5 mg dose group versus the 1.5 mg 
dose in patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8% versus those with baseline HbA1c <8%.

Overall, analyses of changes in HbA1c across patient subgroups were consistent in favour of the two new 
investigational doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) compared to the approved dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
dose strength using the efficacy estimand.

Analyses  of  changes  in  body  weight  across  subgroups  using  the  efficacy  estimand  were  generally 
consistent with the subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint. 
A significant reduction in body weight from baseline to Week 36 was achieved with dulaglutide 4.5 mg 
versus 1.5 mg across all subgroups except for some countries or regions (for details it is referred to the 
CSR). 
The  reduction  in  body  weight  from  baseline  to  Week  36  was  less  pronounced  for  dulaglutide  3.0  mg 
versus 1.5 mg and a significant weight loss was not achieved in subgroups of patients with baseline BMI 
≥median  [-0.7  kg  (-1.5,  0.1);  p=0.091],  in  patients  with  baseline  HbA1c  ≥8.5%  [-0.4  kg  (-1.1,  0.3);

Exploratory Endpoints Analyses 
All analyses of exploratory endpoints were performed in the ITT population, using data collected up to 
initiation  of  new  antihyperglycemic  medication  or  premature  treatment  discontinuation  (efficacy 
estimand). 
Proportion of Patients Achieving ≥5% or ≥10% Body Weight Loss at Week 36 
Using the efficacy estimand, significantly more patients in the dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dose 
groups achieved the exploratory endpoint of ≥5% or ≥10% body weight loss at Week 36: 
For ≥5% reduction: 
• 
• 
• 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg: 172 patients (32.95%), 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg: 215 patients (41.35%); p=0.004 versus 1.5 mg, and 
dulaglutide 4.5 mg: 267 patients (50.76%); p<0.001 versus 1.5 mg. 
For ≥10% reduction: 
• 
• 
• 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg: 33 patients (6.32%), 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg: 64 patients (12.31%); p<0.001 versus 1.5 mg, and 
dulaglutide 4.5 mg: 72 patients (13.69%); p<0.001 versus 1.5 mg. 
Proportion of Patients Achieving HbA1c Target ≤6.5% at Week 36 
At Week 36, a significantly greater proportion of patients who escalated to the higher dulaglutide doses 
achieved an HbA1c ≤6.5% compared to patients maintained on the 1.5-mg dose (1.5 mg: 38.05%; 3.0 
mg: 48.37%; 4.5 mg: 51.71%; p<0.001 for 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg versus 1.5 mg). 
Patients escalating to dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg were significantly more likely to achieve an HbA1c 
target of ≤6.5% compared to those maintained on dulaglutide 1.5 mg at Week 36 (odds ratios [95% CI] 
of 1.62 [1.24; 2.13] and 1.95 [1.48; 2.57] for 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively).

The SMPG data were collected at the following 6 time points: 
- pre-morning meal, 
- 2 hours post-morning meal, 
- pre-midday meal, 
- 2 hours post-midday meal,

Changes from Baseline in Markers of Glucose Metabolism and Beta-Cell Function 
Key results included: 
- Small decreases in fasting insulin were observed in all three dulaglutide groups as measured by the 
geometric LS mean ratio, with no significant differences between the higher dulaglutide dose groups and 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 
-  Small  decreases  in  insulin  resistance  as  measured  by  HOMA2-IR  were  observed  across  the  three 
dulaglutide dose groups with no significant differences between the higher dose dulaglutide groups and 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 
- Mean percent increases in indices of pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA2-%B) were observed in all 
three dulaglutide groups (range, 88.2% to 122.2%). Dulaglutide 4.5 mg significantly increased HOMA2-
%B from baseline compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg (p<0.001). 
- Small decreases in fasting C-peptide as measured by geometric LS mean ratios were observed across 
the three dulaglutide groups with no significant differences between the higher dose dulaglutide groups 
and dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 
- Mean percent decreases were observed in all three dulaglutide groups in indices of alpha-cell function, 
measured  both  by  fasting  plasma  glucagon  (range,  -8.8%  to  -18.0%)  and  fasting  plasma  glucagon 
corrected for fasting glucose (range, -27.5% to -38.2%). Dulaglutide 4.5 mg decreased fasting plasma 
glucagon and adjusted glucagon from baseline significantly more than dulaglutide 1.5 mg (p<0.001 for 
both). 
Health Outcomes/Quality-of-Life Evaluation 
Changes from Baseline in Impact of Weight on Self Perception Questionnaire Scores (IW-SP) 
•  At Week 36, there was a significant improvement in the IW-SP total score from baseline for all 
three dulaglutide dose groups (p<0.001 for all). 
• 
There was a significant difference in the IW-SP total score between both the dulaglutide 4.5-
mg and 3.0-mg dose groups compared with the 1.5-mg dose group at Week 36 (p=0.025 and

p=0.040, respectively), with larger improvements in total score with each investigational dose 
versus the 1.5-mg dose. 
Changes from Baseline in Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living Scores (APPADL) 
•  At Week 36, there was a significant improvement in the APPADL total score from baseline for 
all 3 dulaglutide dose groups (1.5 mg: p=0.002; 4.5 mg and 3.0 mg: p<0.001). 
•  There was a significantly greater improvement in APPADL total score for the dulaglutide 4.5-mg 
group versus the 1.5-mg group at Week 36 (p=0.025). 
Changes from Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimension 5 Level Scores (EQ-5D-5L) 
•  At Week 36, there was a significant improvement in the EQ-5D-5L UK index score and VAS 
score from baseline for all three dulaglutide dose groups. 
•  There were no significant differences across the 3 dulaglutide dose groups in the EQ-5D- 5L UK 
index score and VAS score at Week 36. 
Diabetes Injection Device Experience Questionnaire Scores at Week 12 (DID-EQ) 
•  Mean scores for the three dulaglutide dose groups on the 3 global items ranged from 3.76 to 
3.79 for overall satisfaction, 3.78 to 3.80 for ease of use, and from 3.76 to 3.80 for 
convenience on a 4-point scale. 
•  There were no significant differences between the dulaglutide higher dose groups compared 
with the 1.5-mg group for the 3 global item scores of overall satisfaction, ease of use, and 
convenience. 
Efficacy results at 52 weeks  
Improvements in glycaemic control measures and body weight were sustained from Week 36 to Week 
52 for all dulaglutide doses. 
Using the efficacy estimand (considered primary for purposes of these exploratory 52-week analyses), 
the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  52  was  significantly  greater  in  the  dulaglutide  3.0  mg 
(estimated  treatment  difference,  -0.19%;  p=0.002)  and  4.5-mg  (estimated  treatment  difference,  -
0.31%; p<0.001) dose groups compared to the 1.5-mg group, consistent with the differences observed 
at the primary 36-week endpoint (Table GBGL.9.1). Likewise, a significantly higher proportion of patients 
in the 3.0 mg (65%) and 4.5 mg (72%) dose group achieved an HbA1c <7% compared to those on 1.5 
mg  (59%)  through  52  weeks.  Dose-related  effects  of  dulaglutide  on  FSG,  as  well  as  on  exploratory 
measures of glycemic control (6-point SMBG) and markers of dulaglutide pharmacological action relevant 
to glucose control, were also observed at the final 52-week endpoint, similar to the effects observed at 
the  36-week  primary  endpoint.  These  exploratory  analyses  support  sustainability  in  glycemic  control 
across dulaglutide doses through at least 52 weeks of treatment. 
Mean body weight continued to decline in all the dulaglutide dose groups from Week 36 to Week 52, 
culminating in a mean weight loss of 5 kg at the highest 4.5mg dose using the efficacy estimand (Table 
GBGL.9.1). Change from baseline in body weight at Week 52 was significantly greater in the dulaglutide 
3.0 mg (estimated treatment difference, -0.8 kg; p=0.006) and 4.5 mg (estimated treatment difference, 
-1.6 kg; p<0.001) dose groups compared to the 1.5 mg group, consistent with the differences observed 
at the primary 36-week endpoint (see table below). Significantly more patients in both the dulaglutide 
3.0 mg and 4.5mg dose groups achieved the clinically relevant weight loss threshold of ≥5% at 52 weeks 
than  those  maintained  on  dulaglutide  1.5  mg,  and  the  proportion  of  patients  meeting  weight  loss 
thresholds  at  Week  52  was  consistently  larger  than  at  Week  36.  Thus,  continued  treatment  with 
dulaglutide beyond 36 weeks results in additional mean weight loss across doses, with maintenance of 
greater weight reduction in the 3.0-mg and 4.5-mg groups versus the 1.5-mg dose group.

Although  the  treatment-regimen  estimand  was  only  specified  as  primary  for  purposes  of  testing  the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at 36 weeks at the request of the FDA, this estimand was also 
used  in  the  52-week  exploratory  analyses  of  HbA1c  change  from  baseline,  proportion  of  patients 
achieving HbA1c <7%, FSG change from baseline, and body weight change from baseline. Consistent 
with  the  efficacy  estimand  results,  the  improvements  in  glycaemic  control  measures  were  largely 
sustained while reductions in body weight were numerically greater across all dulaglutide dose groups 
at Week 52 versus Week 36 using the treatment-regimen estimand.

Clinical studies in special populations 
As  this  application  does  not  concern  a  new  indication,  new  pharmaceutical  form  or  new  route  of 
administration,  no  additional  new  studies  in  special  populations  e.g.  in  children,  in  the  elderly  and  in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment have been submitted and reference is made to Section 4.2 and 
Section 5.2 of the approved SmPC. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive studies included a Phase 2 study (GBGJ) and a Phase 1 study (GBGM) which are described 
in detail in the respective sections of this assessment report. 
Previous Conclusions of EPAR Trulicity (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/002825) on Study GBCF  
Study  GBCF  was  a  104-week,  adaptive,  dose-finding  and  confirmatory,  inferentially  seamless,  Phase 
2/3, placebo-controlled, safety, and efficacy study and investigated 7 doses of dulaglutide (0.25 mg, 0.5 
mg, 0.75 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 3.0 mg s.c. once weekly) compared to sitagliptin and placebo 
in patients with T2DM on metformin background therapy. An optimal dose was to be selected based on 
efficacy (HbA1c and weight) and safety (DBP and heart rate) measures. At the completion of the dose-
finding  portion  of  the  study,  the  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  dose  was  selected  as  the  dose  with  the  optimal 
benefit-risk  profile.  Of  note,  randomization  to  the  dulaglutide  3.0  mg  dose  was  stopped  prematurely 
based  on  the  recommendation  of  an  independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  following 
observations of increased heart rate and concerns related to pancreatic safety.

2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The purpose of this application is to add two dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg s.c. once-
weekly). The application is supported by one pivotal phase 3 study (GBGL) and two supportive studies 
(bioequivalence study GBGM and phase 2 study GBGJ). 
Study GBGJ was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2 study in patients with T2DM 
on  metformin  monotherapy.  The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  show  superiority  of  three 
dulaglutide doses (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg)  to placebo in change in HbA1c at 18 weeks in T2DM 
patients.  In  addition,  effects  on  body  weight,  number  of  responders  (HbA1c<7%)  and  fasting  serum 
glucose were investigated. The study consisted of 3 periods: an approximate 2-week lead-in period, an 
18-week  treatment  period,  and  a  4-week  safety  follow-up  period.  A  total  of  317  patients  were 
randomized to one of four treatment arms: placebo n=81, dulaglutide 1.5 mg n=81, dulaglutide 3.0 mg 
n=79, dulaglutide 4.5 mg n=76. To explore the effect on gastrointestinal tolerability two stepwise dose 
escalation algorithms were applied in patients assigned to dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg. 
Efficacy  and  safety  analyses  were  conducted  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomized 
patients taking at least one dose of study medication) by censoring all post-rescue data. It was intended 
that  patients  who  stopped  study  drug  would  immediately  start  rescue  therapy,  and  thus  analyses 
excluding  post-rescue  data  would  also  exclude  any  data  obtained  post  discontinuation  of  study  drug. 
However, there were patients who stopped study drug and did not begin rescue therapy; thus, post-hoc 
analyses were also done excluding data obtained post-rescue or post discontinuation of study drug (the 
“on-treatment without rescue”  analyses).  For comparison of  dose/response  in  this  phase  2 study  this 
approach seems acceptable. 
Concomitant medications and demographic baseline characteristics were generally comparable between 
the treatment groups. A high percentage of patients (91.8%) completed the study through the safety 
follow-up  period;  48  of  318  randomized  patients  (15.1%)  discontinued  from  study  treatment  before 
week  18: Placebo,  11 (13.4%); dulaglutide  1.5 mg,  9 (11.1%); dulaglutide  3.0 mg, 10 (12.7%) and 
dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 18 (23.7%). Adverse events as the most frequent reason for discontinuation of study 
drug occurred in a dose related fashion with more patients discontinuing study drug for AEs at the two 
higher doses dulaglutide: placebo, 4 (4.9%) and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 5 (6.2%), dulaglutide 3.0 mg, 8 
(10.1%) and dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 10 (13.2%).  
The primary objective of the ongoing phase 3 study GBGL was to show superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 
mg, 4.5 mg, or both to dulaglutide 1.5 mg for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 36. Secondary 
objectives were to compare 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide to dulaglutide 1.5 mg with respect to the 
Assessment report

effect on body weight, the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c target <7.0%, and the effect on fasting 
serum  glucose.  The  study  consisted  of  3  periods:  an  approximately  2-week  screening/lead-in  period 
followed by a 52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were separately assessed using two estimands termed an 
“efficacy estimand” and a “treatment-regimen estimand”. For the efficacy estimand, analyses excluded 
data after premature treatment discontinuation or initiation of new antihyperglycemic therapy for more 
than 14 days (whichever occurred first). For these patients, data were implicitly imputed by data from 
comparable patients who are on-treatment using an MMRM model (missing-at-random assumption). It 
may provide a representative estimate of the treatment differences expected with dose escalation from 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg once-weekly to 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg once-weekly attributable to the pharmacological 
action of dulaglutide. Further sensitivity analyses were provided for the efficacy estimand. These support 
the  robustness  of  results  with  regard  to  deviations  from  the  primarily  applied  missing  data  handling 
approach  (MAR  assumption).  For  the  treatment-regimen  estimand,  the  analyses  included  all  data 
collected  before  and  after  initiation  of  new  antihyperglycemic  therapy,  premature  treatment 
discontinuation  (or  both),  with  week  36  missing  data  imputed  using  a  retrieved  drop-out  approach. 
Hence, it provides a conservative estimate of the overall treatment effect in the general population where 
patients may not adhere to treatment, may initiate other glucose lowering therapies, or both. 
In  addition,  and  in  line  with  the  draft  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the 
treatment  or  prevention  of  diabetes  mellitus  (CPMP/EWP/1080/00  Rev.  2),  an  additional  estimand 
addressed  targeting  the  effect  regardless  of  treatment  discontinuation  and  had  rescue  medication  or 
other antihyperglycemic agents not been available. This estimand may be considered of higher relevance 
as compared to the efficacy estimand as it takes drug tolerability issues into account. Still, overall results 
for the additional estimand support results for the efficacy and treatment regimen estimand. Effects for 
all estimands are consistent, similar dose-relating effects are seen for all three investigated estimands, 
and for all estimands observed effects are in line within the range of incremental effects that have been 
accepted  for  other  antihyperglycemic  agents  for  which  different  dose  strengths  have  been  approved. 
Furthermore,  the  additional  estimand  may  in  fact  overestimate  the  impact  of  drug  tolerability  (as  all 
discontinuations are accounted for regardless of reason). Hence, all in all it is agreed to primarily report 
results of the pre-specified primary efficacy estimand.  
A dose-escalation period of 4 weeks at each dose was employed to reduce the occurrence of GI AEs: all 
patients began the trial with 4 weeks of treatment with dulaglutide 0.75 mg once-weekly followed by 4 
weeks of treatment with dulaglutide 1.5 mg once-weekly. After 8 weeks, patients assigned to the 1.5 
mg group continued on 1.5 mg once-weekly. Patients assigned to the 3.0 mg group escalated to 3.0 mg 
once-weekly and maintained this dose for the remainder of the treatment period. Patients assigned to 
the  4.5  mg  group  escalated  to  3.0  mg  once-weekly  for  4  weeks  followed  by  escalation  to  their  final 
assigned dose of 4.5 mg once-weekly at week 12 and beyond.  
A total of 1842 patients were randomized and included in the analysis (dula 1.5 mg n=612, dula 3.0 mg 
n=616, dula 4.5 mg n=614). 
The  population  studied  included  adult  patients  with  T2D  who  were  overweight  and  inadequately 
controlled on concomitant metformin therapy. The mean age of patients was 57 years, mean duration 
of T2D was almost 8 years, mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.6% and the mean BMI 34.2 kg/m2. When 
comparing these patients with the population included in one of the 5 phase 3 studies (assessed in the 
initial MAA), baseline variables for glycemic control were modestly higher (mean baseline HbA1c mean 
value  in  phase  3  studies  7.6  to  8.5%),  duration  of  diabetes  was  longer,  and  body  weight  was  in  the 
upper range of the one in the initial studies. These differences were primarily by design, with study GBGL 
requiring an HbA1c at screening between 7.5% and 11%, whereas the lower limit of HbA1c for inclusion 
in the original efficacy studies was generally 7.0% and 6.5% for the dulaglutide monotherapy study H9X-

MC-GBDC. The rationale for the HbA1c range in Study GBGL was to enroll patients who might require 
treatment intensification and may therefore benefit from treatment with higher dulaglutide doses. This 
is generally accepted.  
Demographic  and  clinical  baseline  characteristics  were  representative  for  the  (European)  target 
population  and  comparable  across  the  3  dulaglutide  dose  groups.  Metformin  dose  (median  2000  mg 
daily) was similar across the three dulaglutide dose groups, and the majority of patients continued on 
metformin with no changes in dose reported up to the week 36 primary endpoint. Metformin was the 
sole additional antihyperglycemic medication. In the initial phase 3 studies, the efficacy of dulaglutide 
1.5  mg  once-weekly  has  been  established  on  a  wide  variety  of  antihyperglycemic  background 
medications. In general, one could expect that any effects observed for the higher doses are preserved 
when  used  in  combination  with  other  glucose-lowering  medications  (and  no  restricted  label  would  be 
necessary in this regard for the higher dose strengths). 
Reassuringly, the number of patients who completed the study and were adherent to study drug was 
high: 93.1% of randomized patients completed the week 36 primary endpoint visit (89% on study drug). 
This  result  is  consistent  with  the  disposition  in  the  five  phase  3  studies  submitted  for  initial  MAA 
(performed with 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg dulaglutide) where 81.3% to 97.2% were on study drug at the 
end of the studies. This may serve a rough indicator of a comparable adherence to study drug between 
the lower and the higher dose ranges of dulaglutide. 
The  occurrence  of  protocol  deviations  was  balanced  across  dulaglutide  dose  groups.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  across  the  3  dose  groups  in  the  proportions  of  patients  initiating  new 
antihyperglycemic therapy for any reason during the treatment period (1.5 mg, 7.0%; 3.0 mg, 5.5%; 
4.5 mg, 6.8%; p=0.491).  Overall, 93.5% of  patients had no new  antihyperglycemic therapy  initiated 
through 36 weeks. Of the 119 patients who initiated new antihyperglycemic therapy for any reason, 91 
of them received this new therapy as rescue for severe, persistent hyperglycaemia.  
Overall, the number of treatment discontinuations and applications of rescue medication is considered 
low;  this  led  to  very  similar  results  between  the  a.  m.  estimands.  Therefore,  except  for  the  primary 
endpoint of the pivotal study, results will be presented for the efficacy estimand only (for detailed results 
for the treatment-regimen estimand please refer to section 3.3.5 of this report). 
The clinical assessment of  the pivotal Phase  3 study  GBGL and the supportive studies (GBGM,  GBGJ) 
submitted for this application did not reveal concerns regarding GCP non-compliance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the phase 2 study GBGJ all three doses of dulaglutide (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) reduced HbA1c 
significantly from baseline compared to placebo (all p-values <0.001; dulaglutide 1.5 mg vs plc -0.80, 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg vs plc -0.87, dulaglutide 4.5 mg vs plc -0.96). However, compared to the 1.5 mg 
dose, only very small numerical improvements in HbA1c were shown after 18 weeks for the two higher 
dose strenghts: -0.08% (-0.34%, 0.19%) for 3.0 mg, p=0.572 and -0.16% (-0.44%, 0.11%) for 4.5 
mg, p=0.235. The HbA1c lowering effect over and above that exerted by 1.5 mg dulaglutide is small and 
of questionable clinical relevance for the study population as a whole.  
All three doses of dulaglutide significantly reduced body weight from baseline compared to placebo at 
week 18 (dula 1.5 mg vs plc -1.2kg, dula 3.0 mg vs plc -2.4 kg, dula 4.5 mg -2.6 kg). In addition, both 
of  the  two  new  higher  dose  strengths  of  dulaglutide  (3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg)  also  reduced  body  weight 
significantly  compared  to  dulaglutide  1.5 mg at week  18.  Body  weight was reduced in  a dose-related 
fashion after 18 weeks of treatment. The effect size, even for the 4.5 mg strength, is moderate (2.6 kg 
correspond  to  2.7%  from  the  mean  BL  body  weight  of  95.7  kg).  A  more  pronounced  effect  on  body 
weight may have been expected with a study duration exceeding 18 weeks.

Significantly greater percentages of patients in all three dulaglutide groups achieved HbA1c<7.0% at 
week 18 than placebo-treated patients (placebo 16.7%, dulaglutide 1.5 mg 66.7%, dulaglutide 3.0 mg 
69.9%,  dulaglutide  4.5  mg  57.5%;  all  p-values  <0.001).  There  was  no  dose-related  increase  in 
responders. This likewise applied for fasting serum glucose, which was significantly reduced compared 
to placebo by all dulaglutide doses, but without a significant differences between doses. As the MoA of 
dulaglutide  is  glucose-dependent,  FSG  is  not  considered  the  ideal  pharmacodynamic  marker;  hence, 
these results are less important in this context.  
Efficacy results of the phase 3 study GBGL (which had no placebo control) were as follows: using the 
efficacy estimand, the LS mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 36 were: -1.53%, -1.71% and 
-1.87% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 4.5 mg, respectively. Using the treatment-regimen estimand, 
the LS mean changes in HbA1c from to week 36 were: -1.54%, -1.64%, and -1.77% for dulaglutide 1.5 
mg, 3.0 mg, 4.5 mg, respectively. HbA1c changes from baseline to week 36 showed that the primary 
efficacy  measure  of  superiority  was  met  with  dulaglutide  4.5  mg  compared  to  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  for 
both the efficacy estimand (-0.34%, p<0.001) and the treatment-regimen estimand (-0.24%, p<0.001). 
For dulaglutide 3.0 mg superiority for the primary efficacy measure was met for the efficacy estimand (-
0.17%, p=0.003) but not the treatment-regimen estimand (-0.10%, p=0.096).  
Overall, the incremental effects on glycaemic control of the higher dose strengths of dulaglutide were 
rather small but are within the additional effects observed for different doses strengths of other approved 
antihyperglycemic agents.  
Results of subgroup analyses of the primary outcome 
Analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c across patient characteristic subgroups were generally 
consistent with the primary results. There were no significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions 
based on age, race, country, ethnicity, region or duration of diabetes.  
The treatment-by-subgroup interaction effect for the primary efficacy measure of HbA1c was significant 
for sex (female versus male) and baseline HbA1c (<8.5% versus ≥8.5%). The subgroup interaction for 
sex is considered unlikely to have clinical relevance (no such finding in previous studies with dulaglutide, 
no plausible biological mechanism). In line with the well-known effect of a greater magnitude of HbA1c 
reduction with higher baseline HbA1c, dose-response relationship was shown to be more pronounced for 
patients with higher baseline HbA1c: for patients with baseline HbA1c <8.5%, the LS mean changes in 
HbA1c from baseline to week 36 were: -1.16%, -1.38% and -1.38% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 
4.5 mg, respectively, and for patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8.5%: -1.89%, -2.02% and -2.34%. Thus, 
the mean difference between the 4.5 mg dose and the 1.5 mg was higher for the patient group with 
HbA1c >8.5% (-0.45% [-0.65, -0.26]) than for the patient group with HbA1c < 8.5% (-0.22 [--0.34,-
0.10]). 
Results of secondary outcome measures 
The LS mean changes in body weight from baseline to week 36 were for dulaglutide 1.5 mg: -3.1 kg, 
for dulaglutide 3.0 mg: -4.0 kg, and for dulaglutide 4.5 mg: -4.7 kg. The mean treatment difference in 
change in body weight versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg was -0.90 kg in the dulaglutide 3.0 mg group (p=0.001) 
and -1.60 kg in the dulaglutide 4.5 mg group (p<0.001).  
Overall, the two new higher dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) resulted in greater body 
weight reduction at week 36 compared to the approved 1.5 mg dose. As outlined above, this likewise 
applied  for  the  placebo-corrected  body  weight  reductions  attained  in  the  shorter  term  18-week  study 
GBGJ (-2.4 kg and -2.6 kg for 3 and 4.5 mg dulaglutide, respectively). Although the incremental effect 
on weight is modest, this is an additional benefit in the usually overweight patients with T2DM.

Both investigational doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) were superior to the 1.5 mg dose in the 
secondary efficacy objective of percent of patients achieving HbA1c <7%: more patients achieved 
an HbA1c<7% at week 36 with dulaglutide 4.5 mg 71.5% (odds ratio [95% CI] versus 1.5 mg=2.23 
[1.65, 3.01]; p<0.001) and dulaglutide 3.0 mg 64.7% (odds ratio [95% CI] versus 1.5 mg=1.49 [1.12, 
1.98], p=0.006) compared to the 1.5 mg dose (57%). The secondary efficacy measure of superiority 
over dulaglutide 1.5 mg for change in fasting serum glucose from baseline to week 36 was met with 
the dulaglutide 4.5 mg dose (-8.1 mg/dL, p<0.001). 
Results of important exploratory endpoints 
The proportion of  patients achieving a HbA1c  goal  of  ≤6.5%  as  well  as improvements  in  6-point  self-
monitored  plasma  glucose  (SMPG)  and  daily  average  SMPG  measures  showed  an  incremental 
improvement in patients treated with 3.0 mg or 4.5mg dula doses compared with those maintained on 
the  dula  1.5  mg  dose.  In  addition,  there  were  also  dose-related  changes  in  markers  of  glucose 
metabolism,  alpha-cell  function,  and  beta-cell  function  that  were  consistent  with  the  known 
pharmacological profile and mechanism of action of dulaglutide. 
Health Outcomes/Quality-of-Life Evaluation 
Two  health  outcomes  questionnaires  were  included  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of  dulaglutide 
treatment on a patient’s perception of health and well-being related to body weight: the Impact of Weight 
on Self-Perceptions Questionnaire (IW-SP) assesses patients’ self-perception related to weight (Hayes 
and DeLozier 2015), and the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living (APPADL) Questionnaire 
assesses how difficult it is for patients to engage in various physical activities such as walking, standing, 
and  climbing  stairs  (Hayes  et  al.  2011;  Hayes  et  al.  2012).  At  week  36,  there  was  a  significant 
improvement in the IW-SP and APPADL total scores from baseline for all three dulaglutide dose groups. 
The  improvement  in  IW-SP  total  score  at  Week  36  was  significantly  greater  in  patients  escalated  to 
dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg compared to patients maintained on dulaglutide 1.5 mg. The improvement 
in APPADL total score was significantly greater with 4.5 mg versus the 1.5 mg group.  
Generic health-related quality of life assessed using the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level 
(EQ-5D-5L) UK index score and VAS score significantly improved from baseline to week 36 for all three 
dulaglutide dose groups, with no significant difference between doses. This is not unexpected given the 
more  general  nature  of  the  assessment  and  heterogeneity  of  the  domains  included  in  the  composite 
scores (mobility, selfcare, anxiety or depression, usual activities, and pain or discomfort). 
These results based on the patients’ self-perception underpin the clinical relevance of the greater weight 
loss achieved with the investigational dulaglutide doses compared to the 1.5 mg dose. 
Exploratory efficacy results at week 52 
Exploratory efficacy analyses at week 52 showed that dose-related improvements in glycaemic measures 
(HbA1c,  FSG),  proportion  of  patients  achieving  HbA1c  targets  of  <7%  and  ≤6.5%,  and  body  weight 
reduction were maintained from 36 weeks to 52 weeks. HbA1c was reduced at week 52 in a dose-related 
fashion (1.5 mg dula -1.52%, 3mg dula -1.71%, 4.5 mg dula -1.83%). Additionally, effects of dula to 
improve  other  measures  of  glycaemic  control  (SMPG),  markers  of  glucose  metabolism,  body  weight 
control (proportion of patients achieving clinically relevant weight loss thresholds), exploratory composite 
endpoints, and health outcomes measures (APPADL and IW-SP) at 52 weeks were all largely maintained 
relative to the effects observed at the primary 36-week endpoint.

2.5.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  design  and  conduct  of  the  clinical  studies  are  acceptable.  The  pivotal  study  GBGL  showed  that 
treatment with dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg was associated with a dose-related improvement in glycemic 
measures  and  body  weight,  partly  demonstrating  significant  superiority  towards  the  1.5  mg  dose. 
Efficacy was maintained throughout week 52. 
Although  the  anti-hyperglycemic  effect  size  brought  about  by  the  two  higher  strengths  is  considered 
rather  small,  it  is  within  the  range  of  incremental  effects  that  have  been  accepted  for  other 
antihyperglycemic agents for which different dose strengths have been approved. The incremental effect 
on  weight-reduction  over  the  dose  range  of  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  to  4.5  mg  was  moderate  but  is  an 
additional benefit for the usually overweight patients with T2DM, which was perceived as such according 
to the health outcome evaluation. Other measures of glycemic control consistently showed small-sized 
dose-related improvements. 
Of note, a prior phase 2 study (study GBCF, submitted during initial MAA) did not show any incremental 
benefit in HbA1c reduction with higher doses (2.0 mg and 3.0 mg) compared to 1.5 mg but the results 
from the considerably larger pivotal study are considered more important.  
Overall, in the overweight study population investigated the benefit of the higher doses over and above 
the one afforded by the 1.5 mg dose was rather small but acceptable. According to SmPC section 4.2, 
up-titration should be performed after a minimum duration of 4 weeks in patients in need of additional 
glycaemic control, which is considered appropriate. The decision to up-titrate after the minimum duration 
of  4  weeks  should  be  based  on  patient  measured  blood  glucose  since  the  full  effect  on  HbA1c  takes 
longer to show than just 4 weeks.  
2.6  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of dulaglutide (1.5 mg QW) in adult patients with T2D has been characterized based 
upon data from the original marketing application and post-marketing data. The most common adverse 
events (AEs) are gastrointestinal (GI) symptom related (for example, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), 
and are generally consistent with findings in the GLP-1 RA class. 
The following presentation of the safety profile of higher once weekly doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 
4.5  mg)  for  treatment  of  patients  with  T2D  focuses  on  the  Phase  3  Study  H9X-MC-GBGL  (GBGL),  an 
ongoing 52-week study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of once-weekly dulaglutide 3.0 mg 
and 4.5 mg in comparison to dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Previously, a safety evaluation based on the 36-week 
results of the phase 3 study GBGL was provided. The safety evaluation was updated and now focuses on 
the 52-week data. 
Since the safety profile of dulaglutide is already known in general, in Study GBGL not all AEs but only 
deaths, SAEs, TEAEs, and discontinuations from study or study drug due to AEs were collected. 
Two  additional  studies  were  performed  as  part  of  the  development  program  for  these  investigational 
dulaglutide doses: A Phase 2 study (H9X-MC-GBGJ [GBGJ]) in 318 adult patients with T2D to provide 
initial safety and efficacy data for dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3.0 mg once-weekly, and a Phase 1 clinical 
pharmacology  study  (H9X-MC-GBGM  [GBGM]),  which  confirmed  equivalent  bioavailability  and  similar 
tolerability of dulaglutide 4.5 mg administered as a single injection via single-dose pen (SDP) (used for 
the Phase 3 study)  versus  an equivalent dose administered as three 1.5-mg injections using prefilled 
syringes (PFS) (used for the Phase 2 study). 
Compared to the phase 2 study, another, more prolonged, scheme of up-titration was used to reduce 
the incidence of nausea and other GI side effects.

Patient exposure 
In the phase 3 study GBGL, 612 to 616 patients per dose group were exposed to dulaglutide for 331 to 
334 days (mean). Total exposure to dulaglutide over the 52 weeks of treatment was 1678.5 patient-
years. In the phase 2 study GBGJ, around 80 patients per dose group were exposed for 110 days (mean). 
Adverse events 
In study GBGL, the fraction of patients per treatment group experienced at least one treatment-emergent 
AE was slightly increasing with dula dose, from 62.1% (1.5 mg dula) to 66.4% (4.5 mg dula). For details 
see table below. A placebo group was not included in this study.

d P-values for overall treatment effect were computed using Fisher’s exact test 
In  Study  GBGJ,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  one  TEAE  in  the  dula  groups  was  somewhat 
higher  than  in  Study  GBGL,  ranging  from  66.7%  to  83.5%;  in  the  placebo  group,  58.0%  of  patients 
experienced at least one TEAE.  
Reassuringly, the percentage of subjects experiencing at least one serious AE (SAE) was fairly balanced 
across  the  treatment  groups  in  both  studies  and  no  dose-dependent  increase  was  observed.  The 
percentages  in  the  dula  groups  was  comparable  to  the  percentage  observed  in  the  placebo  group  of 
Study GBGJ. 
A dose-dependent increase in events of discontinuation of study medication was observed in both trials.  
Regarding the nature of the AEs, expressed according to system organ class and preferred term, it turned 
out that most of them were gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhoea and 
constipation (see the following two tables). This finding was consistent across both studies, GBGJ and 
GBGL, and is expected for a GLP1 receptor agonist. The percentage of patients suffering one or more GI 
events  was  markedly  higher  in  Study  GBGJ  than  in  GBGL  (e.g.  27.8%  vs.  43.2%  in  the  dula  1.5  mg 
group of Study GBGL and GBGJ, respectively). This is most likely due to the faster dose-up-titration in 
the (shorter) study GBGJ.

The applicant also provided a table (see below) showing the types of AEs which were markedly 
different (p-value <0.05) between the dosage groups. A dose-dependent increase was observed with 
abdominal distension and decreased weight. These are established effects of GLP1-receptor agonists. 
The relevance of the other imbalances, which did not show dose dependence, is not known.

GI  side  effects  are  expected  mainly  to  occur  at  the  beginning  of  the  treatment  with  GLP1  receptor 
agonists.  Therefore,  the  applicant  analysed  occurrence  of  nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea  over  time 
during the course of the study. For better comprehension, the figure below displays the dose up-titration 
scheme used in Study GBGL. Dose is increased every four weeks. Thus, in the highest dose group (4.5 
mg QW), it lasts 12 weeks until the intended dose level is reached. 
The prevalence of nausea is shown in the following figure. As expected from the dose up-titration scheme 
presented above, the percentage of patients experiencing nausea increases over the first 12 weeks in 
the 4.5 mg group. It decreases again later and appears to reach a steady state at Week 28 with around 
3% to 5% of patients suffering nausea. Also, the other dose groups seem to be in steady state at this 
time, i.e. with no further change in nausea prevalence.

For vomiting and diarrhoea the prevalence was overall lower than for nausea. It was highest around 12 
to 16 weeks after start of treatment and reached a steady state after around 28 weeks. In steady state, 
the prevalence was nearly identical in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group. 
According  to  the  dose  up-titration  scheme  shown  above,  all  patients  were  treated  equally  in  the  first 
eight  weeks  of  the  study  (dula  0.75  mg  for  four  weeks  and  dula  1.5  mg  for  another  four  weeks). 
Nevertheless,  the  group  finally  ending  up  at  3  mg  QW  displayed  a  higher  frequency  of  nausea  and 
diarrhoea than the other groups in the first eight weeks for unknown reasons. This may indicate that 
variability of the GI findings was high in the first weeks. It is reassuring that the prevalence of the main 
GI  effects  (nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea)  was  very  similar  in  the  low  and  high  dose  group, 
demonstrating that the high dose (4.5 mg QW) does not lead to undue increase in GI side effects with 
the up-titration scheme used in Study GBGL. 
On the other hand, it also becomes obvious from the above figures that at steady state (around Week 
28 onwards) the prevalence of adverse GI effects is consistently higher with the new doses (3.0 and 4.5 
mg) than with the established dose of 1.5 mg. Reassuringly, also with the new doses the prevalence was 
rather low (around 1% for vomiting, 2% for diarrhoea and nearly 5% for nausea). In respect to safety 
it should be noted that these GI effects are hardly hazardous to the patient; if a patient does not tolerate 
higher dulaglutide doses, dose reduction is possible. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Events  of  hypoglycaemia  were  no  more  frequent  in  the  higher  dula  dose  groups  than  in  the  1.5  mg 
group. 
Cardiovascular events 
In Study GBGL, deaths and nonfatal CV AEs were adjudicated by the CEC. The following nonfatal CV AEs 
were  adjudicated:  MI,  hospitalization  for  unstable  angina;  hospitalization  for  heart  failure,  coronary 
interventions  (such  as  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  or  PCI);  and  cerebrovascular  events,  including 
cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack (TIA). 
There were two CV deaths in the 3.0 mg dula group, one in the 1.5 mg group and one in the 4.5 mg 
group. There were also some non-fatal CV events, but no dose-dependency was observed.

The number of confirmed CV events was low in Study GBGL so that firm conclusions are not possible. 
The applicant noted that a CV outcome study (REWIND) did not indicate increased CV risk by dula at the 
1.5 mg QW dose. Although it is acknowledged that the mechanism of action of dula gives no hint for 
adverse effects that could increase CV risk, it is uncertain whether extrapolation of the REWIND results 
to higher dula doses is possible. The processes triggered by GLP1 agonists are complex so that undesired 
CV effects of higher doses cannot fully be excluded.  
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis has been reported with the use of GLP-1 RAs, including dulaglutide. 
It is  known  from  GLP1 receptor agonist that they  can increase  pancreatic enzymes in  the absence of 
other signs for pancreatitis, i.e. in case of therapy with GLP1 agonist, increase in pancreatic enzymes in 
plasm does not necessarily indicate pancreatitis. Alterations of pancreatic enzymes in Study GBGL are 
discussed in the section on laboratory findings. 
In Study GBGL, pancreatitis was analysed based on adjudicated events. A total of 6 events in 6 patients 
were confirmed by the CEC to be pancreatitis, 1 event in the dula 1.5 mg group, 2 events in the dula 
3.0  mg  and  3  events  in  the  dula  4.5  mg  group.  All  6  confirmed  events  were  adjudicated  as  acute 
pancreatitis  and  occurred  when  patients  were  taking  their  final  maintenance  dose  of  dulaglutide.  All 
events were mild in severity, and no pancreatic complications were reported.

Gallbladder disease 
An association between the GLP-1 RA therapeutic class and risk of biliary tract events has been reported. 
In Study GBGL, a total of 30 patients (1.6%) had at least 1 event related to acute gallbladder disease, 
with  similar  proportions  across  the  3  dulaglutide  dose  groups.  The  most  frequent  TE  event  in  the 
Gallbladder-related disorders SMQ was cholelithiasis, which occurred in a total of 16 patients (0.9%): 4 
(0.7%) in the 1.5-mg group, 5 (0.8%) in the 3.0-mg group, and 7 (1.1%) in the 4.5-mg group. 
Serum calcitonin and C-cell hyperplasia/neoplasia 
No events of C-cell hyperplasia or tumour were reported. 
Two patients had a postbaseline serum calcitonin value that was ≥35 ng/L and a ≥50% increase from 
the baseline value. The applicant provided narratives of these patients. One patient was diagnosed with 
multiple myeloma and osteolytic changes. For the other patient no reason for calcitonin elevation was 
found. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
A total of 11 patients died during the study from baseline through Week 52 (see tables below); all 11 
deaths were adjudicated by the CEC. 
Four deaths were confirmed as CV-related upon adjudication; two patients experienced this event while 
receiving 1.5 mg dula (one patient of them was assigned to the 3.0 mg group and was in the up-titration 
phase). One patient received 3.0 mg dula prior to the event and one 4.5 mg. Hence, there was no dose-
dependency.

Besides cholesterol, VLDL particles carry large amounts of triglycerides so that the decrease in VLDL may 
reflect the decrease in triglycerides. Notably, VLDL-C is not measured directly but calculated using the 
triglyceride level. Hence, a similar behaviour of VLDL-c and triglycerides is expected. 
As  for  LDL-C,  decrease  in  plasma  VLDL-C  is  considered  beneficial  so  that  the  above  findings  are  not 
considered a safety concern. They may reflect the dula-induced loss in body fat mass. 
Pancreatic enzymes 
It was observed that GLP1 receptor agonists can increase pancreatic enzymes (lipase, amylase) in serum 
without further signs of pancreatitis. A mean increase in serum lipase and amylase was also observed in 
the participants of Study GBGL, see table below. Pancreatic amylase increased from baseline by 22% 
during  the  course  of  the  study  without  relevant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  Lipase 
increased in mean by 19% with slight dependency from the dula dose.

Apart from serum lipids and pancreatic enzymes no meaningful changes in clinical chemistry 
parameters were observed. 
Haematology 
There were no significant or clinically meaningful differences across the dulaglutide dose groups in 
change from baseline to Week 36 for any haematology parameter. 
Vital signs 
There was an increase in heart rate (HR) during treatment with dual as compared to baseline. This effect 
is known for GLP1 receptor agonists. The increase over baseline was 1.9 bpm at Week 52 with the two 
new doses, 3.0 and 4.5 mg QW. Simultaneously, there was a small decrease from baseline in systolic 
blood pressure (SBP), up to -4.1 mmHg. Changes in HR and SBP were more pronounced with the new, 
higher doses of dula than with the established dose of 1.5 mg QW.

The following figures display the course of HR and SBP over time. Most pronounced effects were observed 
at Week 18 for HR, with increase up to around 4 bpm, and at Week 8 for SBP with decrease of around 
3.2 mmHg for the highest dose. A more pronounced decrease was observed from Week 36 onwards.

ECG 
Dose-dependent shortening of the QTcF interval was observed, the effect being maximal at around 18 
weeks after start of treatment. The time-course was similar to the time course of HR increase so that 
the QTcF shortening could be due to over-correction by the Fridericia formula. 
Furthermore, dula prolonged the PR interval. The effect size was similar for the 3.0 and 4.5 mg dose and 
was  larger  with  the  new  doses  than  with  the  established  dose  of  1.5  mg.  The  time  course  of  the  PR 
elongation is depicted in the following figure. In contrast to HR, PR prolongation was highest at Week 36 
(around 5 ms with the highest dula dose). No further increase was observed thereafter.

In accordance with the PR prolongation, AV block first degree was reported as an AE in 6 to 7 patients 
and second degree in 1 to 2 patients per dose group (see table below). No dependence on dula dose was

to the established dose (1.5 mg) was observed (14 vs. 12).

No obvious explanation can be provided for the PR prolongation. Notably, a higher heart rate is expected 
to shorten the PR interval so that dula’s effect on PR interval is probably even larger. The underlying 
mechanism  is unclear.  Due the small effect  size,  PR prolongation  is  not considered  a concern  per se. 
However, this finding indicates that dula has some (unexpected) effects on the CV system. 
Safety in special populations 
The applicant evaluated the safety profile of dulaglutide in Study GBGL for the most frequently reported 
TEAEs  (occurring  in  ≥5%  patients  in  any  treatment  group)  based  on  the  following  intrinsic  baseline 
factors: age, race, sex, baseline body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, duration of diabetes, and baseline 
eGFR. 
There was a significant treatment-by-sex interaction for nausea and diarrhoea which was driven primarily 
by the higher overall incidence of nausea and diarrhoea in females, with a similar incidence across the 
dulaglutide dose groups. 
AE incidence by  age is  shown  in  the table below.  In subjects ≥75 years  of age AEs were numerically 
more frequent, but the number of study participants is very low in this age group so that firm conclusions 
are not possible.

Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
A  total  of  52  patients  (2.8%)  experienced  a  TEAE  under  the  Hypersensitivity  SMQ,  with  similar 
proportions of patients across the 3 dose groups. The most frequent hypersensitivity PTs were rash (12 
patients [0.7%]) and  urticaria (11 patients [0.6%]),  with similar  proportions  of  patients across the  3 
dose groups. Of the 52 patients with a TEAE of hypersensitivity reaction, 5 were TE ADA+: 1.5 mg, 3 
patients (0.5%); 3.0 mg, 1 patient (0.2%); 4.5 mg, 1 patient (0.2%). 
Injection site reactions 
A total of 24 patients (1.3%) experienced injection site reaction TEAEs per the LSC during the 52-week 
Treatment Period; 11 (0.6%) patients experienced at least 1 potentially immune-mediated injection site 
reaction. The most frequent injection site reaction PTs were injection site pruritus (7 patients [0.4%]) 
and injection site reaction (5 patients [0.3%]). Only 1 patient experienced a new injection site reaction 
after  the  primary  36-week  endpoint.  A  numerically  higher  percentage  of  patients  assigned  to  the 
dulaglutide 4.5-mg group (13 patients, 2.1%) experienced any injection site reactions compared to those 
assigned to the dulaglutide 1.5-mg (5 patients, 0.8%) and 3.0-mg (6 patients, 1.0%) groups. Of the 24 
patients with a TEAE of injection site reaction, 5 were TE ADA+: 1.5 mg, 0 patients; 3.0 mg, 1 patient 
(0.2%); 4.5 mg, 4 patients (0.7%). 
Anti-drug-antibodies (ADA) 
A patient was considered to have TE dulaglutide ADA if the patient had at least 1 titer that was TE relative 
to baseline, defined as a 4-fold increase in titer from baseline when dulaglutide ADA were detected at 
baseline, or 2-fold greater than the MRD of the screening assay (MRD 1:2) if no dulaglutide ADA were 
detected at baseline. 
Samples were analysed using a 4-tiered approach in validated ADA assays. All samples were assessed 
in  Tier  1  (screening).  Samples  at  or  above  the  screening  assay  cut  point  were  assessed  in  Tier  2a 
(confirmation). Any samples confirmed as positive for ADA in Tier 2a were reported as “detected.” All 
samples below the screening assay cut point, Tier 1, or not confirmed in Tier 2a were reported as “not 
detected.” Any “detected” sample in Tier 2a was assessed in Tier 2b (cross-reactive binding to native 
GLP-1),  Tier  3  (titer  assessment),  and  Tier  4a  (dulaglutide  neutralizing  ADA  assay).  Any  “detected” 
sample in Tier 2b was assessed in Tier 4b (native GLP-1 neutralising assay). 
The ADA results are summarised in the table below. The proportion of patients with TE ADA was similar 
in all dula dose groups and was around 4%.

*a  A subject is TE ADA evaluable if there is at least one non-missing test result for LY ADA for each of the baseline 
period and the postbaseline period. All percentages are relative to the total number of TE ADA evaluable 
subjects in each treatment group 
*b  If ADA is DETECTED with no titer available, baseline titer is imputed as 1:2 and postbaseline titer is imputed as 
1:4. A TE ADA evaluable subject is considered to be TE ADA+ if the subject has at least one postbaseline titer 
that is a 4-fold or greater increase in titer from baseline measurement (treatment boosted). If baseline result is 
ADA Not Present, then the subject is TE ADA+ if there is at least one postbaseline result of ADA Present with 
titer >= 1: 4 (treatment-induced). A TE ADA evaluable subject is TE ADA Inconclusive if >=20% of the subject's 
postbaseline samples, drawn pre-dose, are ADA Inconclusive and the subject is not otherwise TE ADA+. A TE 
ADA evaluable subject is TE ADA- if not TE ADA+ and not TE ADA Inconclusive. 
*c  P-values are from Fisher's exact test 
In search for neutralising antibodies, the applicant also addressed potential clinical signs of decreasing 
therapeutic effect of dula, thereby considering HbA1c and body weight. Changes of these two parameters 
were similar for all patients and the patients with TE ADA, indicating absence of neutralising antibodies. 
The applicant did not show the changes in titre from pre- to post-treatment. This information was only 
included in  the  definition  of  “treatment emergent”, but detailed titre results were  not  provided.  For a 
complete picture this information should be provided. For some subjects, titres were imputed.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
GLP1 receptor agonists are known to retard gastric emptying. This can affect the absorption of other 
drugs and is discussed in the PK/PD section of this report. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
In total, 7.2% of study participants discontinued due to AE up to Week 52. discontinuation rate 
increased with dula dose from 6.0% to 8.5%, see table below. The predominant reason for 
discontinuation was a GI-related AE.

Post-marketing experience 
Post-marketing experience exists for the 1.5 mg QW dose but not for the new, higher doses of 3.0 and 
4.5 mg QW. 
2.6.1.   Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  safety  information  on  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg  dula  QW  came  from  the  phase  3  study  GBGL, 
providing comparison to the 1.5 mg QW dose. The safety profile of 1.5 mg QW dula is well established 
from  marketing  authorisation  studies  and  post-marketing  experience.  The  applicant  also  conducted  a 
phase  2  trial  with  the  new  doses,  Study  GBGJ.  The  safety  outcome  of  the  latter  was  in  line  with  the 
results from Study GBGL with the exception that GI side effects were more pronounced in Study GBGJ 
since a faster dose up-titration scheme was used. This is not relevant for clinical use since in the SmPC 
the  slow  up-titration  (dose  increase  after  at  least  four  weeks)  as  used  in  the  phase  3  study  GBGL  is 
recommended. 
Since the safety profile of dulaglutide is already known in general, not all AEs were collected in the pivotal 
study  GBGL  but  only  serious  AES,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  and  AEs  of  special  interest. 
Reassuringly, the percentage of patients suffering a serious AE was not higher in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg 
groups than in the 1.5 mg group. The number of deaths was balanced between the treatment groups. 
As  expected  for  a  GLP1  receptor  agonist,  the  most  frequent  AEs  were  related  to  gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. Most events occurred in the first weeks after start 
of treatment. The frequency of GI side effects was somewhat higher with the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg doses 
than with the 1.5 mg dose, but this is not regarded as a safety concern since dose reduction is possible 
if  a  subject  does  not  tolerate  the  higher  doses  due  to  GI  effects.  Comparison  of  the  frequency  of  GI 
events in Study GBGL (phase 3) vs. Study GBGJ (phase 2) revealed that not the absolute dose of dula 
but the dose escalation scheme mainly determines the rate of GI effects. 
A  potentially  serious  side  effect  of  GLP1  receptor  agonists  is  pancreatitis.  Diagnosis  of  the  latter  is 
complicated  by  the  fact  that  GLP1R  agonists  increase  the  level  of  pancreatic  enzymes  in  plasma 
independent  of  pancreatitis  (e.g.  by  triggering  increased  synthesis).  Potential  pancreatitis  cases  were 
adjudicated by an expert committee. In the 1.5 mg dula group of Study GBGL, 1 confirmed pancreatitis 
event occurred, and in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg groups 2 and 3 events, respectively, per group. Due to 
the  small  number  of  events,  firm  conclusions  are  not  possible.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  reassuring  in 
respect to safety that the number of events was low. Additional reassurance can be derived from wide 
clinical experience with the substance class. Pancreatitis is an important identified risk in the RMP and is 
appropriately addressed in the SmPC, section 4.4.     
The most important safety aspect when increasing the dula dose for diabetes treatment is the effect on 
cardiovascular (CV) risk. A CV outcome trial was conducted with dula 1.5 mg which did not indicate an 
increased risk, but the situation for higher doses is unclear. There is a previous example of increasing 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 101/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the dose of a GLP1R agonist, i.e. liraglutide. This compound was developed for treatment of diabetes at 
a  lower  dose,  and  thereafter  the  indication  obesity  was  sought  with  a  higher  dose.  In  this  case, 
information on CV safety was derived from a meta-analysis of the 4 clinical studies conducted to support 
the obesity indication (Saxenda EPAR). In the case of dula, performing a meta-analysis is not possible 
because only one study was conducted. In addition, the number of CV events was rather low so that firm 
conclusions are not possible. In the absence of a CV outcome study with the higher doses applied for, 
assessment  of  CV  risk  has  to  rely  on  the  CVOT  conducted  with  the  1.5  mg  dose,  on  mechanistic 
considerations  and  on  the  clinical  experience  with  the  substance  class.  A  known  CV  effect  of  GLP1R 
agonist is increase in heart rate. This was also observed for dula, but the magnitude of the effect was 
rather  small  (increase  by  1.9  bpm  from  baseline  at  Week  52  in  the  mid-  and  high-dose  group). 
Simultaneously,  there  was  a  slight  decrease  in  systolic  blood  pressure.  The  applicant  considered  the 
increase in HR too small for constituting a CV risk. This is generally agreed but ECG recordings revealed 
that  dula  had  additional,  partly  unexplained  effects  on  cardiac  function.  There  was  shortening  of  the 
Fridericia-corrected  QTc  interval  which  could  be  due  to  over-correction  of  the  increased  HR  by  the 
Fridericia formula although other effects cannot be excluded. And there was a consistent prolongation of 
the PR interval over the whole study duration, accompanied by a slight increase in cardiac conduction 
disorders. Notably, a higher heart rate is expected to shorten the PR interval so that dula’s effect on PR 
interval is  probably  somewhat larger. The underlying mechanism  is  unclear. However, this  effect was 
also small so that no relevant increase in events of higher-degree AV block is expected. 
Notably, the dulaglutide dose of 3.0 mg was tested previously in the seamless phase 2 / phase 3 study 
GBCF  which  had  been  submitted  with  the  original  MAA  for  dula.  In  this  study,  the  3.0  mg  arm  was 
prematurely stopped, among others because of a marked mean increase in heart rate by 6.6 bpm. In 
the present  phase 3 study GBGL,  HR increase peaked  at Week 18 and reached a peak  increase from 
baseline of around 4 to 5 bpm in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group, respectively. The peak coincided with 
the peak in the intensity of GI side effects so that the latter may have contributed to the HR increase. 
Reassuringly,  HR  decreased  during  the  further  course  of  Study  GBGL,  ending  up  at  1.9  bpm  above 
baseline at Week 52 in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group; for comparison, in the 1.5 mg group HR was 1.0 
bpm above baseline at this time point. 
The applicant has investigated the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Around 4% of the subjects 
in each dose group showed treatment-emergent antibodies. Reassuringly there was no dose dependence, 
i.e. the higher doses did not display increased immunogenicity. Also, injection site reactions and systemic 
hypersensitivity  reaction  were  not  more  frequent  with  the  new  3.0  and  4.5  mg  doses  than  with  the 
established 1.5 mg dose. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new safety signals appeared with the higher doses 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg as compared to the established 
dose  of  1.5  mg.  Also,  the  most  prominent  side  effects  of  treatment  with  incretin  mimetics,  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and other GI symptoms, were not relevantly increased with the new doses due to a 
careful dose up-titration regimen. 
The most relevant safety aspect is CV safety of the higher doses since a CV outcome trial was performed 
with the 1.5 mg dose only. In Study GBGL, submitted to support use of the higher doses, the rate of CV 
events  was  very  low.  The  studied  population  was  at  slightly  higher  risk  for  adverse  cardiovascular 
outcomes compared to the population included in the five phase 3 studies submitted with the initial MAA 
(higher  inclusion  threshold  for  HbA1c,  longer  duration  of  diabetes,  all  patients  overweight  or  obese). 
However, firm conclusions on CV safety of the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dose are not possible to draw on the 
basis  of  the  submitted  data  but  additional  experience  with  the  substance  class  provides  sufficient 
reassurance. Dulaglutide slightly increased HR, which is a known effect of GLP1 receptor agonists, but 
Assessment report

also prolonged the PR interval.  The underlying mechanism is  unknown. However,  this effect was also 
small so that no safety concerns arise.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Dulaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, is approved at two doses (0.75 mg and 1.5 mg s.c. 
once weekly) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this application is to add two new 
dose  strengths  (dulaglutide  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg  s.  c.  once-weekly)  for  patients  who  need  additional 
glycaemic control. 
The present indication remains unchanged by this line extension. The proposed update of the posology 
reads as follows:  
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
“… 
For additional glycaemic control,  
1.  the 1.5 mg dose may be increased after at least 4 weeks to 3.0 mg once weekly. 
2.  the 3.0 mg dose may be increased after at least 4 weeks to 4.5 mg once weekly. 
The maximum dose is 4.5 mg once weekly. 
3.2.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are several classes of medicinal products for the treatment of T2D. All products have been shown 
to reduce  blood glucose level and to improve HbA1c.  Based on the extensive therapeutic experience, 
metformin  is  currently  recommended  as  first-line  treatment  for  all  patients  with  T2D,  unless 
contraindications apply (most notably, GFR <30 ml/min). Recently, SGLT2-inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor 
agonists  have  shown  to  be  superior  compared  to  placebo  in  reducing  3-point  MACE  in  patients  with 
established CV disease in CV outcomes trials.  
Because T2D is a progressive disease, treatment intensification is often required to maintain glycaemic 
control over time. There may be advantages to increase the dose of one drug before adding another, for 
instance,  the  complexity  of  treatment  would  be  reduced  and  the  risk  of  new  side  effects  would  be 
avoided.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study GBGL assessed the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg compared to dulaglutide 
1.5 mg in patients with T2D on metformin monotherapy. Efficacy and safety endpoints were evaluated 
at week  36,  as predefined.  The primary  objective of  this study  was to demonstrate  that  once-weekly 
dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 3.0 mg, or both, was superior to dulaglutide 1.5 mg for change from baseline HbA1c. 
Key secondary endpoints were other measures of glycaemic control (responder analysis and FSG) and 
body weight reduction. The study enrolled overweight or obese patients (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) with HbA1c of 
7.5% (58 mmol/mol) to 11% (97 mmol/mol), inclusive, despite a stable dose of metformin monotherapy. 
The  phase  2  study  GBGJ  (n=317)  is  supportive  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy.  It  was  a  randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with T2DM on metformin monotherapy. The primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020  
Page 110/117 
 
 
 
 
objective of this trial was to show superiority of three dulaglutide doses (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) to 
placebo as regards change in HbA1c at 18 weeks in T2DM patients. Secondary endpoints were in line 
with those in study GBGL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Within  this  line  extension,  the  PK  data  provided  evidence  to  support  dulaglutide  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg 
once-weekly as distinct doses from an exposure perspective. 
HbA1c changes from baseline to week 36 showed that the primary efficacy measure of superiority was 
met with dulaglutide 4.5 mg compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg for both the efficacy estimand (-0.34%, 
p<0.001) and treatment-regimen estimand (-0.24%, p<0.001). For dulaglutide 3.0 mg superiority for 
the  primary  efficacy  measure  was  met  for  the  efficacy  estimand  (-0.17%,  p=0.003),  but  not  the 
treatment-regimen estimand (-0.10%, p=0.096). 
Both investigational doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) were superior to the 1.5 mg dose in the 
secondary efficacy objective of percentage of patients achieving HbA1c <7%. The percentages of patients 
achieving an HbA1c <7% were 57.0% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 64.7% for dulaglutide 3.0 mg (odds ratio 
[95% CI] versus 1.5 mg: 1.49 [1.12, 1.98], p=0.006), and 71.5% for dulaglutide 4.5 mg (odds ratio 
[95% CI] versus 1.5 mg: 2.23 [1.65, 3.01], p<0.001). 
The  secondary  efficacy  measure  of  superiority  over  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  for  change  in  fasting  serum 
glucose from baseline to week 36 was met with the dulaglutide 4.5 mg dose for the efficacy estimand (-
8.1 mg/dL, p<0.001). For dulaglutide 3.0 mg, superiority was not met for FSG (-3.7 mg/dL, p=0.084).  
The least squares mean changes in body weight from baseline to week 36 were for dulaglutide 1.5 mg: 
-3.1  kg,  for  dulaglutide  3.0  mg:  -4.0  kg,  and  for  dulaglutide  4.5  mg:  -4.7  kg.  The  mean  treatment 
difference in change in body weight versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg was -1.60 kg in the dulaglutide 4.5 mg 
group (p<0.001) and -0.90 kg in the dulaglutide 3.0 mg group (p=0.001).  
Two  validated  health  outcomes  questionnaires  were  included  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of 
dulaglutide  treatment  on  a  patient’s  perception  of  health  and  well-being  related  to  body  weight:  the 
Impact of Weight on Self-Perceptions Questionnaire (IW-SP) and the Ability to Perform Physical Activities 
of Daily Living Questionnaire (APPADL). At week 36, there were statistically significant improvements in 
the  IW-SP  and  the  APPADL  total  scores  from  baseline  for  all  three  dulaglutide  dose  groups.  The 
improvement in IW-SP total score at Week 36 was statistically significantly greater in patients escalated 
to  dulaglutide  3.0  mg  or  4.5  mg  compared  to  patients  maintained  on  dulaglutide  1.5  mg.  The 
improvement in APPADL total score was statistically significantly greater with 4.5 mg versus the 1.5 mg 
group. 
Supportive benefits from study GBGJ (valuable for evaluation of the effect size due to placebo control): 
All three doses of dulaglutide (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) reduced HbA1c significantly from baseline 
compared to placebo (all p-values <0.001; dulaglutide 1.5 mg vs plc -0.80, dulaglutide 3.0 mg vs plc -
0.87, dulaglutide 4.5 mg vs plc -0.96). Compared to the 1.5 mg dose, a numerical improvement was 
shown in glucose control after 18 weeks: -0.08% (-0.34%, 0.19%) for 3.0 mg, p=0.572 and -0.16% (-
0.44%, 0.11%) for 4.5 mg, p=0.235.  
All three doses of dulaglutide significantly reduced body weight from baseline compared to placebo at 
week 18 (dula 1.5 mg vs placebo -1.2 kg, dula 3.0 mg vs placebo -2.4 kg, dula 4.5 mg vs placebo -2.6 
kg).  In addition, both of the two new higher  dose  strengths of  dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) also 
reduced body weight significantly compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg at week 18. 
Exploratory efficacy results at week 52 showed that efficacy was maintained throughout week 52.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The magnitude of the observed changes in HbA1c in study GBGL for the two new higher dose strengths 
versus  dulaglutide  1.5  mg  is  considered  rather  small  but  within  the  range  of  incremental  effects  that 
have  been  accepted  for  other  antihyperglycemic  agents  for  which  different  dose  strengths  have  been 
approved. 
Strengths  of  dulaglutide  higher  than  1.5  mg  were  not  supported  by  the  dose-finding  study  GBCF 
submitted  during  the  initial  marketing  authorization  procedure  in  2014  (EMEA/H/C/002825).  In  this 
study dula 2.0 mg and 3.0 mg had a numerically smaller effect on HbA1c-reduction compared to dula 
1.5 mg. However, results have to be seen in the light of the small patient number per dose group and 
are considered less important compared to the data from study GBGL. 
In studies GBGJ and GBGL dulaglutide was studied as add-on to metformin but not in combination with 
other antihyperglycemic agents (in contrast to the phase 3 studies where dula was tested add-on various 
background  medications).  However,  this  is  not  considered  a  relevant  limitation,  as  any  incremental 
benefit  of  the  higher  doses  is  likely  to  be  maintained  when  used  in  combination  with  other  glucose-
lowering medications. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most prominent side effects of GLP1 receptor agonists are gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. These mainly occur upon commencement of treatment 
and can be ameliorated by starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly. Besides of being a tolerance 
issue,  the  possibility  exists  that  the  accompanying  alteration  of  gastrointestinal  motility,  e.g.  delayed 
gastric emptying, may affect bioavailability of concomitantly taken oral medication. Prevalence of GI side 
effects  was  somewhat  higher  with  the  new  doses  of  3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg  dulaglutide  than  with  the 
established dose of 1.5 mg. 
GLP1 receptor agonists are also known to increase heart rate, most likely via action on CNS. Dulaglutide 
3.0 mg and 4.5 mg increased the heart rate by around 4 bpm from baseline at Week 18 and around 3 
bpm at Week 36, compared to 1.5 bpm with 1.5 mg dula. Furthermore, there was a small but consistent 
elongation of the PR interval in the ECG; the underlying mechanism is unclear. 
Otherwise no new undesired effects of dulaglutide became obvious during the newly submitted studies 
GBGJ and GBGL. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
GLP1 receptor agonists are known to increase pancreas enzymes (lipase, amylase) in the serum, but it 
is unclear whether this GLP1-related increase is indicative for pancreatitis. Both lipase and amylase levels 
increased from baseline in study participants by – on average - 20% to 25% with weak dose-dependency. 
Potential events of pancreatitis were adjudicated by an expert board. Confirmed cases of pancreatitis 
were rare (one case in the 1.5 mg group and two cases each in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group). The risk 
of pancreatitis is included in the RMP as important identified risk and appropriately labelled. 
Cardiovascular  safety  was  established  for  1.5  mg  QW  dulaglutide  in  a  CV  outcome  trial.  It  is  unclear 
whether the results of this trial can be extrapolated to the higher doses. However, the effects of dula on 
heart rate were very small so that a relevant increase in CV risk is unlikely. Furthermore, prolongation 
of the PR interval was observed in the ECG, but this effect was also small so that no relevant increase in 
events of higher-degree AV block is expected. Further reassurance regarding CV safety can be derived 
from the clinical experience with the substance class. 
Assessment report  
EMA/572529/2020

Notably, the dulaglutide dose of 3.0 mg was tested previously in the phase 2 / phase 3 study GBCF which 
had  been  submitted  with  the  original  MAA  for  dula.  In  this  study,  the  3.0  mg  arm  was  prematurely 
stopped,  among  other things because of  a marked  increase in  heart rate by  6.6 bpm. In  the present 
phase  3  study  GBGL,  HR  increase  peaked  at  Week  18  and  reached  a  peak  increase  from  baseline  of 
around 4 to 5 bpm in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group. HR decreased during the further course of Study 
GBGL, ending up at 1.9 bpm above baseline at Week 52 in the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg group; for comparison, 
in the 1.5 mg group HR was 1.0 bpm above baseline at this time point. 
The GBGL data suggest a trend towards increased exposure in patients aged ≥75 years or with declining 
renal function. However, a clinical relevance is considered unlikely, because the majority of observed PK 
concentrations in patients aged ≥75 in study GBGL are within the 90% PK prediction intervals. Moreover, 
based on clinical data for the lower dulaglutide doses (0.75 mg and 1.5 mg) in patients with impaired 
renal function, and based on theoretical considerations about the elimination mechanism of dulaglutide, 
no clinically relevant impact of impaired renal function on dulaglutide exposure is to be expected.  
Potential interactions of concomitantly administered oral drugs with the 4.5 mg dose of dulaglutide were 
predicted based on a PBPK modelling approach that included some simplifications (e.g. in most cases, 
potential changes of intestinal transit times were not considered in the model), but no distinct drug-drug 
interaction  studies  were  performed  with  the  higher dose  strengths.  Thus,  it  is  clearly  stated  in  SmPC 
section  4.5  that  the  interactions  with  the  higher  dulaglutide  strengths  were  predicted  by  a  modelling 
approach.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Studies GBGL and GBGJ in overweight patients with T2DM showed overall small-sized but still relevant 
incremental reductions in HbA1c for dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg compared to the approved 1.5 mg 
dose strength. In study GBGL, additional measures of glycaemic control (number of patients achieving 
HbA1c<7%, FSG) showed dose-related numerical improvements.  
The  two  new  higher  dose  strengths  of  dulaglutide  (3.0  mg  and  4.5  mg)  led  to  greater  body  weight 
reductions at week 36 compared to the approved 1.5 mg dose. This likewise applied for the placebo-
corrected body weight reductions attained in the shorter 18-week phase 2 study GBGJ (-2.4 kg and -2.6 
kg  for  3  and  4.5  mg  dulaglutide,  respectively).  Despite  the  moderate  effect  size,  additional  weight 
reduction is an additional benefit in the mostly overweight T2DM population. Subgroup analyses suggest 
that  patients  with  higher  BMI  experienced  greater  weight  loss  compared  to  those  with  lower  BMI. 
According to the results of the patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires (Impact of Weight on 
Self-Perceptions  Questionnaire  (IW-SP)  and  the  Ability  to  Perform  Physical  Activities  of  Daily  Living 
Questionnaire (APPADL)), patients perceived weight reduction and associated effects as beneficial.  
Overall, the safety data for the two new doses do not indicate an unacceptable risk or tolerability issue.  
Prevalence of GI side effects was somewhat higher with the new doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg dulaglutide 
than with the established dose of 1.5 mg. This is not considered an important issue since dose reduction 
would be possible if an individual subject does not tolerate the higher doses. 
A recent CV outcome study with the established dulaglutide dose of 1.5 mg s.c. QW did not indicate a 
CV risk but it is not clear whether this result can be extrapolated to higher doses. However, the effects 
of the higher doses of dulaglutide on heart rate (increase) and PR interval (prolongation) were so small 
that an increase in CV risk is highly unlikely. Further reassurance regarding CV safety can be derived 
from the clinical experience with the substance class.  
Pancreatitis is an identified risk of GLP-1 receptor analogues. In Study GBGL, pancreatitis was analysed 
based on adjudicated events. A total of 5 events in 5 patients were confirmed by the Clinical Endpoint 
Committee (CEC) to be pancreatitis, 1 event in the dulaglutide 1.5 mg group, 2 events in the dulaglutide 
3.0 mg and 3 events in the 4.5 mg group. All 6 confirmed events were adjudicated as acute pancreatitis 
and occurred when patients were taking their final maintenance dose of dulaglutide. Due to the small 
number of events, firm conclusions are not possible. The risk of pancreatitis is included in the RMP as 
important identified risk and appropriately labelled.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  additional  antihyperglycemic  effects  of  the  higher  doses  applied  for  are  considered  beneficial  in 
patients who are insufficiently controlled with lower doses. These benefits need to be balanced against 
a potential increase in adverse events, e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and some cardiac effects such 
as  increase  in  heart  rate,  PR  prolongation,  and  concerns  related  to  pancreatic  safety.  Overall,  the 
tolerability  and  safety  issues  are  considered  manageable  and  not  prohibitive  for  the  approval  of  the 
higher dose strengths.  
Albeit only overweight patients had been included in study GBGL, extrapolation of the benefit/ risk to 
patients  with  BMI<25  kg/m2  seems  justified,  as  it  was  demonstrated  that  neither  efficacy  (HbA1c 
reduction) nor tolerability depended on baseline BMI. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of the two new higher dose strengths of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) is positive. 
The overall B/R of Trulicity is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit-
risk balance of Trulicity 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg (solution of injection in pre-filled pen) is favourable in the 
following indication: 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Trulicity is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
• 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Trulicity subject 
to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of 
the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

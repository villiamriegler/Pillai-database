1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the completed paediatric study AI424452 for Reyataz hard capsules, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study AI424452 started in November 2012 and completed on 20-Feb-2017. Study AI424452 was a 
post-approval commitment safety study for the US FDA to assess the safety of ATV capsules boosted 
with RTV (ATV/RTV) administered with an optimized nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) 
background therapy in patients ≥ 6 to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 15 kg. The study was to 
provide confirmatory safety data through 24 weeks of study treatment for ATV/RTV at the 
recommended doses approved in the United States (US) in 2008 and the European Union (EU) in 2010 
(ATV 150, 200 and 300 mg, each with RTV 100 mg, for 15 to < 20 kg, 20 to < 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg 
weight groups, respectively). Atazanavir paediatric dosing recommendations were later revised in the 
EU in 2016 and in the US in 2017. The approved dosing recommendations used in Study AI424452 
were those in effect at the time of the study and therefore are not consistent with the current posology 
of Reyataz in US and EU (see below the current approved posology).

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In this study, all subjects received ATV capsules boosted with RTV tablets or capsules administered 
according approved paediatric dosing recommendations at the time of the study (ATV/RTV 150/100, 
200/100 and 300/100 mg for 15 to < 20 kg, 20 to < 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study AI424452. This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label 
study evaluating the safety of ATV capsules boosted with RTV capsules or tablets administered once 
daily (QD) with an optimized background therapy of 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected antiretroviral (ARV)-naive 
or –experienced paediatric subjects ≥ 6 to < 18 years of age. Subjects were enrolled from South 
Africa, South America countries, US and Russia. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study AI424452 
Methods 
Objective 
Primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ATV  capsule  boosted  with  RTV-based 
regimens in paediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to < 18 years of age dosed for 24 weeks. 
Study design 
This is a Phase 4 ongoing prospective single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety 
of ATV capsule boosted with RTV capsules or tablets QD with an optimized background therapy of 2 
NRTIs in HIV-infected, ARV-naive and -experienced pediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to < 18 years of age, 
and ≥ 15 kg.  
Treatment-experienced subjects were defined by previous exposure to ARV drugs through either prior 
treatment for their HIV infection, or through post-natal treatment with ≥ 1 ARV as part of the 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission. For the purposes of this study, subjects exposed to ARVs 
in utero or intra-partum were eligible for the study, but were considered treatment naive. Eligible 
subjects were required to have a screening HIV viral load of ≥ 1000 copies/mL (ARV-naive) or ≥ 400 
copies/mL (ARV-experienced). Subjects at screening were to have genotypic sensitivity (ARV-naïve 
subjects) or genotypic and phenotypic sensitivity (ARV-experienced subjects) to ATV and at least 2 
NRTIs approved for pediatric use per the local country label. 
All subjects received ATV capsules boosted with RTV tablets or capsules administered according 
approved pediatric dosing recommendations at the time of the study (ATV/RTV 150/100, 200/100 and 
300/100 mg for 15 to < 20 kg, 20 to < 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively). The NRTI 
backbone consisted of 2 NRTIs locally approved for pediatric use at doses specified in the country’s 
label(s). Subjects were dosed for a minimum of 24 weeks. However, in countries where there is no 
locally approved pediatric indication for ATV capsule, subjects may continue on study treatment and 
have regular 12-week study visits.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety variables included deaths, adverse events (AEs) (serious and nonserious), including Other 
Significant Adverse Events and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Class C acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) events, concomitant medication use, laboratory measurements, 
and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Class C AIDS events were assessed only through Week 24. 
Statistical Methods 
No statistical comparisons between weight bands were conducted, and only summary statistics are 
presented. Categorical variables are summarized with counts and percents or with proportions 
(number with event divided by number evaluable) and percents. Continuous variables are summarized 
with univariate statistics.

Results 
Recruitment/Number analysed 
Fifty-nine subjects were treated. Fifty-three (89.8%) subjects completed 24 weeks of study treatment. 
Forty-seven (79.7%) subjects continued in the study after Week 24, and 30 of them completed the 
study. 
Table 3.  Summary of End of Study Subject Status - Treated Subjects 
[1] Can include subjects who either completed or discontinued phase 1 
[2] Note that Table 1 reports incorrectly that 18 subjects (30.5%) did not complete the study. However, 1 subject is counted in error in the end of study 
analysis as continuing after Week 24 and discontinuing due to lack of efficacy This subject completed Week 24 but did not continue after Week 24 due to 
lack of efficacy  
Baseline data 
Most subjects (50.8%) were female; 59.3% were Black/African American, and 57.6% were from South 
Africa. Of the 59 treated subjects, 32 (54.2%) were ARV-naive and 27 (45.8%) were ARV-experienced. 
The overall median baseline HIV RNA was 4.05 log10 c/mL; 15% of subjects had HIV RNA > 100,000 
c/mL. The overall median CD4 count was 390 cells/mm3, and the median CD4% was 19%.

Safety results 
Exposure 
The mean time on ATV/RTV treatment at the time of the Week 24 primary analysis was 37, 47, and 38 
weeks in the 15 to < 20 kg, 20 to < 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively. By the end of the 
study, the mean time on ATV/RTV therapy was 109, 102, and 65 weeks in the 15 to < 20 kg, 20 to < 
40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively. The shorter exposure in the ≥ 40 kg weight group in 
the  end-of-study  analysis  reflects  the  fact  that  subjects  in  this  weight  group  were  older  at  baseline 
than the other 2 groups (11 of the 23 subjects in the ≥ 40 kg weight group were at least 16 years of 
age  at  baseline)  and  reached  18  years  of  age  and  completed  earlier  than  subjects  in  the  lower  (and 
younger) baseline weight groups. 
Lamivudine  tablet  was  the  most  common  medication  in  the  NRTI  backbone  both  at  Week  24  (31 
subjects) and at the end of the study (33 subjects). Other common medications in the NRTI backbone 
were  abacavir  tablets,  tenofovir  tablets,  and  zidovudine  tablets.  The  mean  daily  doses  of  NRTI 
medications were consistent with pediatric dose recommendations in the respective product labels. 
Overall safety summary 
The overall safety profile at Week 24 of ATV capsules boosted with RTV in pediatric subjects ≥ 6 and < 
18  years  of  age  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  previous  ATV  pediatric  and  adult  studies.  No  safety 
finding  was  identified  in  this  pediatric  population  that  had  not  been  reported  previously  in  other 
pediatric and adult studies of ATV.

ALT = alanine aminotransferase, DILI=drug induced liver injury 
The most common AEs (≥ 10% across weight groups) through Week 24 were nasopharyngitis 
(16.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.9%), vomiting (16.9%), cough (13.6%), abdominal pain 
(11.9%), hyperbilirubinemia (11.9%), and influenza, nausea, and jaundice (each 10.2%). 
Hyperbilirubinemia was the most common Grade 3 to 4 AE, occurring in 3 (5.1%) subjects, 2 (6.1%) 
in the 20 to < 40 kg weight group and 1 (4.3%) in the ≥ 40 kg weight group, all with Grade 3 events. 
All other Grade 3 to 4 AEs occurred in only 1 subject per AE term (neutropenia, overdose, and post

procedural haemorrhage in the 20 to < 40 kg weight group; and abdominal pain, ALT increased, 
appendicitis, blood bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypersensitivity in the ≥ 40 kg weight 
group). No Grade 3 to 4 rash and no Grade 3 to 4 cardiac events were reported. 
Deaths and SAEs 
One subject died during Year 2 (bacterial meningitis not considered related to the study therapy). 
Overall, the cumulative incidence of SAEs was 8 (13.6%) subjects (0, 1, 3, and 4 subjects in the 15 to 
< 20 kg, 20 to < 40  kg,  and  ≥  40  kg weight groups,  respectively). Other than  overdose, which was 
reported as an SAE in 2 subjects as accidental  overdose  and overdose,  respectively, none  of  the  on-
treatment SAEs occurring in this study was reported for more than 1 subject per AE term; no SAE was 
considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  study  treatment;  and  none  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
The cumulative incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was 3 (5.1%) subjects: 1 in the 20 to < 40 
kg  weight  group  (Grade  1  pulmonary  tuberculosis)  and  2  in  ≥  40  kg  weight  group  (Grade  3  acute 
allergic systemic reaction considered related to study drug and resolved off treatment, and one Grade 
2 tuberculosis of the eye). 
AEs of interest 
-  Hyperbilirubinemia:  Through  Week  24  database  lock,  13  (22.0%)  subjects  had  hyperbilirubinemia-
related AEs (0, 3 [9.1%] and 10 [43.5%] in  the  15  to < 20 kg, 20 to  < 40 kg, and  ≥  40 kg weight 
groups,  respectively).  Most  hyperbilirubinemia  AEs  were  Grade  2  to  4  (9  of  the  13  subjects).  Four 
additional subjects had hyperbilirubinemia events (Grade 1 to 3) after the Week 24 database lock. All 
except 1 were considered related to study drug. 
- Renal toxicity: One subject (20 to < 40 kg weight group) had a Grade 1 hematuria on Day 421 that 
was  considered  not  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  This  subject  subsequently 
experienced 3 renal SAEs  (hematuria on Day 665, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis on Day 695, 
and  glomerulonephritis  on  Day  865),  a  non-serious  AEs  of  nephrotic  syndrome  (Day  787)  and 
proteinuria on Day 1177. None of these  AEs or  SAE  was  considered related  to the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator. 
-  Cardiac  disorders:  Through  the  Week  24  database  lock,  6  (10.2%)  subjects  had  cardiac  disorders. 
Four  subjects  (20  to  <  40  kg  group)  had,  respectively,  first  degree  atrioventricular  (AV)  block  (2 
subjects, and one of the two also had sinus bradycardia), AV block (1 subject), and sinus bradycardia 
(1  subject).  The  first  degree  AV  block  in  1  of  the  2  subjects  with  this  event,  and  the  AV  block  in  1 
subject  were  each  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigators.  Two  subjects  (≥  40  kg 
group)  had  AEs  of  sinus  bradycardia  that  were  considered  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigators, and the subjects continued on treatment. After Week 24, through the end of the study, a 
cardiac AE  (Grade 1 sinus tachycardia)  was  reported  for 1 additional subject (≥  40 kg group), which 
was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. 
- Rash: Seven (11.9%) subjects had rash events (4 in the 20 to <40 kg group and 3 in the ≥ 40 kg 
group). None of these events was considered related to the study drug by the investigators. No Grade 
3 or Grade 4 AE was reported in the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.

-  AIDS  events:  1  subject  (20  to  <  40  kg  group)  had  Grade  1  pulmonary  tuberculosis  that  was 
considered not related to the study drug by the investigator.  
No  on-treatment  events  of  lipodystrophy,  lactic  acidosis  syndrome  or  symptomatic  hyperlactatemia, 
cholelithiasis, or nephrolithiasis were reported at any time during the study. 
Laboratory AEs 
The majority of subjects had normal serum chemistries, except for amylase (72.9%), low bicarbonate 
(71.2%) and total bilirubin (62.7%), which were abnormal at any grade level across all weight groups. 
Grade 3 to 4 abnormalities were infrequent except for total bilirubin and amylase:

Two subjects, both in the  ≥  40 kg weight  group, had  ALT and total bilirubin measurements that  met 
laboratory  criteria  for potential  DILI  (ALT  or  AST  >  3x  ULN  with  concurrent  total  bilirubin  >  2x  ULN) 
during the first 24 weeks of the study. 
2.3.3.  MAH’s discussion 
The benefit-risk profile for ATV paediatric capsules has not changed. In the post-approval commitment 
safety study AI424452, ATV capsules, boosted with RTV capsules or tablets, administered with 2 NRTIs 
using  the  approved  dosing  recommendations,  were  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  across  all  3 
weight bands through 24 weeks of treatment (the primary endpoint) and through the end of the study. 
There  were  no  unexpected  or  novel  safety  events.  No  safety  findings  were  identified in  this  pediatric 
population that had not been reported previously in other ATV pediatric and adult studies, or that merit 
an update to the product information. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
In 2010, an extension of indication for atazanavir (Reyataz hard capsules) was accepted (variation II-
57) to include HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 6 years of age. Study AI424452 was a Post-
Assessment Measure (PAM) initiated in 2012 in order to consolidate the safety data of Reyataz in the 
paediatric subjects. Therefore, the posology and the formulations of Reyataz in this study were those 
adopted at the time of its initiation. 
In  2016  through  the  procedure  EMEA/H/C/494/X/94/G,  the  posology  of  Reyataz  hard  capsules  in 
paediatric  subjects  (≥  6  years  and  weighing  at  least  15  kg)  was  modified,  and  a  new  formulation 
(Reyataz oral powder) was authorised for younger paediatric subjects (≥ 3 months of age). 
Old  paediatric  dosage  of  Reyataz  capsules 
Current  paediatric  dosage  of  Reyataz 
(+RTV) 
capsules (+RTV) 
≥15 kg to <20 kg: 150/100 mg QD 
≥15 kg to <35 kg: 200/100 mg QD 
≥20 kg to <40 kg: 200/100 mg QD 
≥35 kg: 300/100 mg QD 
≥40 kg: 300/100 mg QD 
For  a  similar  weight,  the  ATV  exposure  may  be  higher  with  the  current  dosage  of  Reyataz  in 
comparison  to  the  dosage  in  study  AI424452.  Therefore,  the  final  results  of  study  AI424452  have 
become outdated. However, it is noted that no new safety signal was highlighted within this study. We 
agree with the MAH that the safety profile in this paediatric study is overall similar with those in adults. 
In conclusion, no additional recommendation or variation could be issued from this final report of study 
AI424452. 
  Fulfilled: No regulatory action required.

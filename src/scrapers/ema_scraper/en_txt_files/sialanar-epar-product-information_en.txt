CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Symptomatic treatment of severe sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and 
adolescents aged 3 years and older with chronic neurological disorders. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Sialanar should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of paediatric patients with 
neurological disorders. 
Posology 
Due to the lack of long term safety data, Sialanar is recommended for short -term intermittent use (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population – children and adolescents aged 3 years and older  
The dosing schedule for glycopyrronium is based on the weight of the child, starting with 
approximately 12.8 micrograms/kg per dose (equivalent to 16 micrograms/kg per dose 
glycopyrronium bromide), three times per day and increasing by the doses shown in Table 1 below, 
every 7 days. Dose titration should be continued until efficacy is balanced with undesirable effects and 
amended up or down as appropriate, to a maximum individual dose of 64 micrograms/kg body weight 
glycopyrronium or 6 ml (1.9 mg glycopyrronium, equivalent to 2.4 mg glycopyrronium bromide) three 
times a day, whichever is less. Dose titrations should be conducted in discussion with the carer to 
assess both efficacy and undesirable effects until an acceptable maintenance dose is achieved.  
Undesirable effects may be minimised by using the lowest effective dose necessary to control 
symptoms. It is important that the carer checks the dose volume in the syringe before administration. 
The maximum volume of the highest dose is 6 ml. In the event of a known anticholinergic adverse 
reaction occurring when the dose is increased, the dose should be reduced to the previous lower dose 
and the event monitored (see section 4.4). If the event does not resolve treatment should be 
discontinued. In the event of constipation, urinary retention or pneumonia (see section 4.8), treatment 
should be stopped and the prescribing physician contacted.

Younger children may be more susceptible to adverse reactions and this should be borne in mind when 
any dose adjustments are carried out. 
Following the dose titration period, the child’s sialorrhoea should be monitored, in conjunction with 
the carer at no longer than 3 monthly intervals, to assess changes in efficacy and/or tolerability over 
time, and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
The Table 1 shows the dose in ml of solution to be given for each weight range at each dosing 
increase.

Special populations 
Paediatric population (children aged < 3 years) 
The safety and efficacy of glycopyrronium bromide in children aged from birth to < 3 years has not 
been established. No data are available. 
Adult population 
Sialanar is indicated for the paediatric population only. There is limited clinical trial evidence on the 
use of glycopyrronium in the adult population with pathological drooling.  
Elderly 
Sialanar is indicated for the paediatric population only. The elderly have a longer elimination half-life 
and reduced medicinal product clearance as well as limited data to support efficacy in short-term use. 
As such Sialanar should not be used in patients over the age of 65 years. 
Hepatic impairment  
Clinical studies have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is 
cleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and hepatic impairment is not 
thought to result in a clinically relevant increase in systemic exposure of glycopyrronium. 
Renal impairment 
Doses should be reduced by 30% in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR <90 - 
≥30 ml/min/1.73m2) (see Table 2). This medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with severe 
renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2), including those with end-stage renal disease requiring 
dialysis (see section 4.3).

Method of administration 
For oral use only. 
Co-administration with food results in a marked decrease in systemic medicinal product exposure (see 
section 5.2). Dosing should be at least one hour before or at least two hours after meals or at consistent 
times with respect to food intake. High fat food should be avoided. Where the child’s specific needs 
determine that co-administration with food is required, dosing of the medicinal product should be 
consistently performed during food intake.  
Insert the syringe adaptor into the neck of the bottle. Insert the end of the oral syringe into the syringe 
adaptor and ensure it is secure. Turn the bottle upside down. Gently pull down the plunger to the 
correct level (see Tables 1 and 2 for the correct dose). Turn the bottle upright. Remove the oral 
syringe. Place the oral syringe inside the child’s mouth and press the plunger slowly to gently release 
the medicinal product. If the child is given the medicinal product through a feeding tube, flush the tube 
with 10 ml of water after you have given the medicinal product. 
The oral syringe should be gently washed with warm water and allowed to dry after each use (i.e. three 
times per day). Do not use a dishwasher.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
Glaucoma. 
Urinary retention.  
Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2), including those with end-stage renal disease 
requiring dialysis. 
History of intestinal obstruction, ulcerative colitis, paralytic ileus, pyloric stenosis and myasthenia 
gravis. 
Concomitant treatment with potassium chloride solid oral dose and anticholinergics (see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Anticholinergic effects 
Anticholinergic effects such as urinary retention, constipation and overheating due to inhibition of 
sweating may be dose dependent and difficult to assess in a disabled child. Monitoring by physicians 
and caregivers is required with adherence to the management instructions below: 
The carer should stop treatment and seek advice from the prescriber in the event of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
constipation 
urinary retention  
pneumonia 
allergic reaction 
pyrexia 
very hot weather 
changes in behaviour 
After evaluating the event, the prescriber will decide if treatment should remain stopped or if this 
should continue at a lower dose (see section 4.2). 
Lack of long-term safety data 
Published safety data are not available beyond 24 weeks treatment duration. Given the limited long-
term safety data available and the uncertainties around the potential risk for carcinogenicity, total 
treatment duration should be kept as short as possible. If continuous treatment is needed (e.g. in a 
palliative setting) or the treatment is repeated intermittently (e.g. in the non palliative setting treating 
chronic disease) benefits and risks should be carefully considered on a case by case basis and 
treatment should be closely monitored. 
Mild to moderate sialorrhoea 
Due to the low likelihood of benefit and the known adverse effect profile, Sialanar should not be given 
to children with mild to moderate sialorrhoea. 
Cardiac disorders 
Glycopyrronium should be used with caution in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias and conditions characterised by tachycardia 
(including thyrotoxicosis, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac surgery) due to the potential increase in heart 
rate, blood pressure and rhythm disorders produced by its administration (see section 4.8). The carer 
should be advised to measure the pulse rate if the child seems unwell and report very fast or very slow 
heart rate. 
Gastro-intestinal disorders 
Antimuscarinics such as glycopyrronium should be used with caution in patients with gastro-
oesophageal reflux disease, pre-existing constipation and diarrhoea.  
Dental disorders 
Since reduced salivation can increase the risk of oral cavities and periodontal diseases, it is important 
that patients receive adequate daily dental hygiene and regular dental health checks. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respiratory disorders 
Glycopyrronium can cause thickening of secretions, which may increase the risk of respiratory 
infection and pneumonia (see section 4.8). Glycopyrronium should be discontinued if pneumonia is 
present. 
Central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions 
Increased CNS effects have been reported in clinical trials including: irritability, drowsiness, 
restlessness, overactivity, short attention span, frustration, mood changes, temper outbursts or 
explosive behaviour, excessive sensitivity, seriousness or sadness, frequent crying episodes and 
fearfulness (see section 4.8). Behavioural changes should be monitored. 
As a consequence of its quaternary charge glycopyrronium has limited ability to penetrate the blood 
brain barrier, although the extent of penetration is unknown. Caution should be exercised in children 
with compromised blood brain barrier, e.g. intraventricular shunt, brain tumour, encephalitis. 
Children below the age of 3 years 
Sialanar is not recommended in children below the age of 3 years since there is very limited data on 
the efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium in this age group  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium free’. 
Sodium benzoate 
This medicinal product contains 2.3 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each ml. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Paediatric population 
There are limited data available relating to interactions with other medicinal products in the paediatric 
age group.  
The following medicinal product interaction information is relevant to glycopyrronium. 
Contraindications of concomitant use (see section 4.3) 
Potassium chloride solid oral dose 
Glycopyrronium may potentiate the risk of upper gastrointestinal injury associated with oral solid 
formulations of potassium chloride due to increased gastrointestinal transit time creating a high 
localized concentration of potassium ions. An association with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 
small bowel ulceration, stenosis, perforation, and obstruction has been observed.  
Anticholinergics 
Concomitant use of anticholinergics may increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects. 
Anticholinergics may delay the gastrointestinal absorption of other anticholinergics administered 
orally and also increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use to be considered with caution 
Antispasmodics 
Glycopyrronium may antagonize the pharmacologic effects of gastrointestinal prokinetic active 
substances such as domperidone and metoclopramide.  
Topiramate 
Glycopyrronium may potentiate the effects of oligohidrosis and hyperthermia associated with the use 
of topiramate, particularly in pediatric patients. 
Sedating antihistamines 
Sedating antihistamines may have additive anticholinergic effects. A reduction in anticholinergic 
and/or antihistamine dose may be necessary. 
Neuroleptics/antipsychotics 
The effects of active substances such as phenothiazines, clozapine and haloperidol may be potentiated. 
A reduction in anticholinergic and/or neuroleptic/antipsychotic dose may be necessary. 
Skeletal muscle relaxants 
Use of anticholinergics after administration of botulinum toxin may potentiate systemic 
anticholinergic effects. 
Tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs 
Tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs may have additive anticholinergic effects. A reduction in 
anticholinergic and/or tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs dose may be necessary. 
Opioids 
Active substances such as pethidine and codeine may result in additive central nervous system and 
gastrointestinal adverse effects, and increase the risk of severe constipation or paralytic ileus and CNS 
depression. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for potentially 
excessive or prolonged CNS depression and constipation. 
Corticosteroids 
Steroid-induced glaucoma may develop with topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous, steroid 
administration. Concomitant use may result in increased intraocular pressure via an open- or a closed-
angle mechanism. 
Other  
Medicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. antihistamines, antidepressants) may cause 
cumulative parasympatholytic effects including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation and 
confusion, and an increased risk of anticholinergic intoxication syndrome.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child-bearing potential 
Effective contraception should be considered prior to treating women of childbearing age, where 
appropriate. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of Sialanar in pregnant women. The assessment of reproductive endpoints 
for glycopyrronium is limited (see section 5.3). Glycopyrronium is contraindicated during pregnancy 
(see section 4.3).  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Safety in breast-feeding has not been established. Use while breast-feeding is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of Sialanar on male or female fertility. Reproductive performance in 
rats given glycopyrronium shows a decrease in the rate of conception and in survival rate at weaning. 
There are insufficient data in the public domain to adequately assess effects on the reproductive 
system in young adults (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sialanar has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The anticholinergic effects 
of glycopyrronium may cause blurred vision, dizziness and other effects that may impair a patient's 
ability to perform skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle and using machines. The undesirable 
effects are increased with increasing dose. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions are common with glycopyrronium due to its known pharmacodynamic 
anticholinergic effects. The most common adverse reactions are dry mouth (11%), constipation (20%), 
diarrhoea (18%), vomiting (18%), urinary retention (15%), flushing (11%) and nasal congestion 
(11%).  
Adverse reactions are more common with higher doses and prolonged use. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in the literature for trials using glycopyrronium for sialorrhoea in the 
paediatric population (including 2 placebo controlled trials, an uncontrolled safety study using 
glycopyrronium for a 6 month period, and 3 supportive studies with adverse reaction data in the target 
population) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 3). Within each system organ class, the 
adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: 
very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 
to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Urinary retention 
Urinary retention is a known adverse reaction associated with anticholinergic medicinal products 
(15%). Glycopyrronium treatment should be stopped until the urinary retention resolves. 
9 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
Pneumonia 
Pneumonia is a known adverse reaction associated with anticholinergic medicinal products (7.9%). 
Glycopyrronium treatment should be stopped until the pneumonia resolves.  
Constipation 
Constipation is a known adverse reaction associated with anticholinergic medicinal products (30%). 
Glycopyrronium treatment should be stopped until the constipation resolves. 
Central nervous system 
Although glycopyrronium has limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier, increased central nervous 
system effects have been reported in clinical trials (23%). Such effects should be discussed with the 
carer during treatment reviews and a dose reduction considered (see section 4.4).  
Cardiac disorders 
Glycopyrronium is known to have an effect on heart rate and blood pressure at doses used during 
anaesthesia although clinical trials in children with chronic drooling have not shown this effect. An 
effect on the cardiovascular system should be considered when assessing tolerability (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
Symptoms 
Overdose of glycopyrronium can result in anticholinergic syndrome, produced by the inhibition of 
cholinergic neurotransmission at muscarinic receptor sites. Clinical manifestations are caused by CNS 
effects, peripheral nervous system effects, or both. Common manifestations include flushing, dry skin 
and mucous membranes, mydriasis with loss of accommodation, altered mental status and fever. 
Additional manifestations include sinus tachycardia, decreased bowel sounds, functional ileus, urinary 
retention, hypertension, tremulousness and myoclonic jerking.  
Management 
Patients presenting with anticholinergic toxicity should be transported to the nearest emergency 
facility with advanced life support capabilities. Pre-hospital gastrointestinal decontamination with 
activated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures and the 
resulting risk of pulmonary aspiration. At hospital, activated charcoal can be administered if the 
patient’s airways can be adequately protected.  Physostigmine salicylate is recommended when 
tachydysrhythmia with subsequent hemodynamic compromise, intractable seizure, severe agitation or 
psychosis is present.  
Patients and/or parents/caregivers should be counselled to ensure an acurate dose is given each time, in 
order to prevent the harmful consequences of anticholinergic reactions of glycopyrronium seen with 
dosing errors or overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for functional gastrointestinal disorders, synthetic 
anticholinergics, quaternary ammonium compounds, ATC code: A03AB02.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Glycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic with peripheral effects similar to those of 
atropine.  
Antimuscarinics are competitive inhibitors of the actions of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors 
of autonomic effector sites innervated by parasympathetic (cholinergic postganglionic) nerves. They 
also inhibit the action of acetylcholine where smooth muscle lacks cholinergic innervation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Salivation is primarily mediated by parasympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. 
Glycopyrronium competitively inhibits cholinergic muscarinic receptors in salivary glands and other 
peripheral tissues, thus indirectly reducing the rate of salivation. Glycopyrronium has little effect on 
cholinergic stimuli at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on structures innervated by postganglionic 
cholinergic neurons, and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but have no cholinergic 
innervation. 
Peripheral antimuscarinic effects that are produced as the dose increases are: decreased production of 
secretions from the salivary, bronchial and sweat glands; dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) and 
paralysis of accommodation (cyclopegia); increased heart rate; inhibition of micturition and reduction 
in gastrointestinal tone; inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Placebo controlled efficacy data includes patients with a treatment duration of 8 weeks. There is no 
placebo or comparator controlled data beyond 8 weeks. 
Zeller et al 2012a evaluated the efficacy of glycopyrronium bromide oral solution (1 mg/5 mL) in 
managing problem drooling associated with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions. Thirty-
eight patients aged 3–23 years weighing at least 27 lb (12.2 kg) with severe drooling (clothing damp 
5–7 days/week) were randomised to eight-weeks treatment with glycopyrronium (n = 20), 
20-100 μg/kg (not exceeding 3 mg in total) three times a day, or matching placebo (n = 18). The first 
four weeks were an individual titration period in fixed steps depending on response followed by 
4-weeks maintenance treatment. Primary efficacy endpoint was responder rate, defined as percentage 
showing ≥3-point improvement on the modified Teacher’s Drooling Scale (mTDS). The primary 
analysis population was revised to only comprise patients with an age of 3 -16 years which rendered 
19 patients in the glycopyrrolate oral solution group and 17 in the placebo group. Responder rate was 
defined as at least a 3-point improvement in modified Teacher’s Drooling Scale (mTDS).

In addition, 84% of physicians and 100% of parents/caregivers regarded glycopyrrolate as worthwhile 
compared with 41% and 56%, respectively, for placebo (p≤0.014). Most frequently reported 
treatment-emergent adverse events (glycopyrrolate vs placebo) were dry mouth, constipation, 
vomiting and nasal congestion. 
The safety and efficacy of glycopyrronium have been studied in an open labelled study with no control 
group over a 24-week period in children aged 3 to 18 years. At the week 24/exit visit, 52.3% (95% 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence interval 43.7–60.9) of patients (n=130) had an at least three-point decrease in mTDS from 
baseline and were classified as responders to treatment with oral glycopyrrolate solution. The safety 
profile was consistent with the one seen with anticholinergics (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Mean absolute oral bioavailability of glycopyrronium comparing a single 50 µg/kg oral dose and a 
single 5 µg/kg intravenous dose was low at approximately 3% (range 1.3–13.3%) in children aged 
7-14 years undergoing intraocular surgery (n = 6) due to the medicinal product’s low lipid solubility. 
Data from sparse PK sampling in children suggests dose proportional PK.  
The bioavailability of oral glycopyrronium in children was between that of adults under fed and fasted 
conditions.  
Distribution 
In adults, distribution of glycopyrronium was rapid following a single 6 µg/kg intravenous dose; 
distribution half-life was 2.2 ± 1.3 minutes. Following administration of 3H-labelled glycopyrronium 
more than 90% of the radiolabel disappeared from the plasma in 5 minutes, and almost 100% within 
30 minutes, reflecting rapid distribution. Analyses of population pharmacokinetic data from healthy 
adults and children with cerebral palsy-associated chronic moderate to severe drooling who received 
glycopyrronium (route of administration and doses not specified) did not demonstrate linear 
pharmacokinetics of the medicinal product. 
The volume of distribution, 0.64 ± 0.29 L/kg in adults is similar to that of total body water. Volume of 
distribution is somewhat higher in the paediatric population(s), in the range 1.31 to 1.83 L/kg. 
The PK of glycopyrronium has been shown to be essentially independent of age in children in the age 
range 0.19 – 14 years administered a 5 µg/kg intravenous single-dose. In most paediatric subjects, 
plasma glycopyrronium vs. time plots are reported to show a triexponential curve; adults generally 
show a biexponential curve. Modest changes in volume of distribution (Vss) and clearance (Cl) have 
been observed in children between 1 and 3 years of age, leading to a statistically significant shorter 
elimination half-life (t½, z) than that observed in younger (<1 year of age; p = 0.037) or older (>3 years 
of age; p = 0.042) groups.  
In a study in healthy adults, a 2000 µg single dose of glycopyrronium bromide resulted in an AUC of 
2.39 µg.h/L (fasted). An AUC0-6 h of 8.64 µg.h/L was observed after 6 µg/kg intravenous 
glycopyrronium. 
Based upon theoretical physicochemical considerations, the quaternary ammonium compound 
glycopyrronium would be expected to have low central bioavailability; no glycopyrronium was 
detectable in the CSF of anaesthetised surgical patients or patients undergoing caesarean section 
following a 6 – 8 µg/kg intravenous dose.  In the paediatric population 5 µg/kg intravenous 
glycopyrronium has low central bioavailability, except in the case where the blood brain barrier has 
been compromised (e.g. a shunt infection). 
Elimination 
The primary route of elimination of glycopyrronium is via renal excretion, mainly as unchanged 
medicinal product. Approximately 65% of an intravenous dose is renally excreted within the first 
24 hours. A small proportion (~5%) is eliminated in the bile.   
The elimination half-life of glycopyrronium appears to be dependent on route of administration being 
0.83 ± 0.27 hours after intravenous administration, 75 minutes after intramuscular administration and 
in the region of 2.5 - 4 h after oral (solution) administration, though again this was highly variable. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That the latter two half-lives, and especially that for oral administration, are longer than for 
intravenous administration probably reflects the complex absorption and distribution of 
glycopyrronium by each route.  It is possible that prolonged absorption after oral administration 
translates into elimination being faster than absorption (known as flip-flop kinetics, characterized by 
Ka < Ke). 
The total body clearance of the medicinal product following an intravenous dose is relatively high at 
between 0.54 ± 0.14 L/h/kg and 1.14 ± 0.31 L/h/kg. As this exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and 
it appears that more than 50% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, it is probable that the 
renal elimination of glycopyrronium involves both glomerular filtration and proximal tubular secretion 
by the base secretory mechanism.   
A mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4 fold was seen in adult subjects with 
mild and moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30mL/min/1.73m2) and up to 2.2 fold in subjects with 
severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2). A 30% dose 
reduction (see Table 2) is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Glycopyrronium is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Other 
Baseline characteristics 
Baseline characteristics (age, weight, gender and race) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
glycopyrronium. 
Hepatic impairment 
Impaired hepatic function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium since the 
majority of the medicinal product is eliminated through the kidneys. 
Food 
Co-administration with food results in a marked decrease in systemic glycopyrronium exposure (see 
section 4.2).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data, including genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have not been performed for 
Sialanar. 
Limited non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity.  
The single dose toxicity of glycopyrronium has been tested in a range of investigations, although only 
limited experimental details are available. Upon oral administration, high LD50 values of 550 mg/kg in 
mice and above 1,000 mg/kg in rats were reported.  In rats at higher doses (1500-2000 mg/kg) tremors, 
clonic and tonic convulsions and laboured breathing were observed prior to death, resulting from 
respiratory failure.  
Chronic oral administration of glycopyrronium at doses of 4, 16 and 64 mg/kg for up to 27 weeks in 
dogs produced mydriasis, cycloplegia, xerostomia, emesis, occasional lacrimation, injection of sclera 
and rhinorrhoea.  
Extrapolation of safety margins to the paediatric population is not possible, as no exposure data are 
available from repeated dose toxicology studies and no studies in juvenile animals have been 
performed with glycopyrronium. 
Data on reproductive endpoints for glycopyrronium are very limited. A reduction in corpora lutea was 
observed in female rats administered glycopyrronium. No effects on fertility were observed in male 
rats. Reproductive performance in rats given glycopyrronium shows a decrease in the rate of 
conception and in survival rate at weaning. The significance of the non-clinical findings for humans is 
not clear, and the lack of human data on the medicinal product leads to glycopyrronium being 
contraindicated in pregnant women. There are insufficient data in the public domain to adequately 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assess effects on the reproductive system in young adults, and safety in human pregnancy has not been 
established.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information 
1.   What Sialanar is and what it is used for 
Sialanar contains the active substance glycopyrronium.  
Glycopyrronium belongs to a group of medicines known as quaternary ammonium anticholinergics, 
which are agents that block or reduce the transmission between nerve cells. This reduced transmission 
can de-activate the cells that produce saliva. 
Sialanar is used to treat excessive production of saliva (sialorrhoea) in children and adolescents aged 
3 years and older.  
Sialorrhoea (drooling or excessive salivation) is a common symptom of many diseases of the nerves 
and muscles. It is mostly caused by poor control of muscles in the face. Acute sialorrhoea may be 
associated with inflammation, dental infections or infections of the mouth. 
Sialanar acts on the salivary glands to reduce production of saliva.  
2.   What you need to know before you give Sialanar 
Do not give Sialanar if your child or adolescent: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
is allergic to glycopyrronium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)  
is pregnant or breast feeding 
has glaucoma (raised pressure in the eye) 
is unable to completely empty the bladder (urinary retention) 
has severe kidney disease 
has an obstruction of the stomach (pyloric stenosis) or bowel causing vomiting  
has diarrhoea (frequent, loose watery stools) 
has ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the intestine) 
stomach ache and swelling (paralytic ileus) 
has myasthenia gravis (muscle weakness and tiredness) 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
is taking any of the following medicines (see section Other medicines and Sialanar):  
potassium chloride solid oral dose;  
anticholinergic medicines. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Sialanar if your child has: 
• 
heart disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeats or high blood pressure   
• 
digestive disorders (constipation; chronic heartburn and indigestion) 
• 
a high temperature (fever) 
• 
inability to sweat normally 
• 
kidney problems or difficulty passing urine 
• 
abnormal blood brain barrier (the layer of cells surrounding the brain) 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to your child, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before 
giving Sialanar. 
pneumonia 
allergic reaction 
urinary retention  
changes in behaviour 
constipation 
fever 
The carer should stop treatment and seek advice from the prescriber in the event of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Avoid exposing the child to hot or very warm temperature (hot weather, high room temperature) to 
avoid over heating and the possibility of heat stroke. Check with the child’s doctor during hot weather 
to see if the dose of Sialanar should be reduced. 
Reduced salivation can increase the risk of dental disease therefore the child’s teeth should be brushed 
daily and they should have regular dental health checks. 
Children with kidney problems may be given a lower dose. 
Check the child’s pulse if they seem unwell. Report a very slow or very fast heart rate to their doctor. 
Long-term use 
The long-term efficacy and safety of Sialanar has not been studied beyond 24 weeks of use. Continued 
use of Sialanar should be discussed with the child’s doctor every 3 months to check that Sialanar is 
still right for the child.  
Children under 3 years 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age because it is formulated as an oral 
formulation and a dose specifically for use in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older. 
Other medicines and Sialanar 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular taking Sialanar with the following medicines can affect the way Sialanar or the listed 
medicine works or can increase the risk of side effects: 
• 
potassium chloride solid oral dose (see section above “Do not give Sialanar if the child or 
adolescent:”)  
anticholinergic medicines (see section above “Do not give Sialanar if the child or adolescent:”) 
antispasmodics used to treat sickness or vomiting e.g. domperidone and metaclopramide 
topiramate used to treat epilepsy 
antihistamines, used to treat some allergies

skeletal muscle relaxants (botulinum toxin) 
antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants)  
opioids used to treat severe pain 
corticosteroids, used to treat inflammatory diseases  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for further information about medicines to avoid whilst taking 
Sialanar. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is intended for use in children and adolescents. Sialanar must not be given if the patient 
is pregnant (or could be pregnant), or is breast-feeding (see section 2 ‘Do not give’). Discuss with the 
child’s doctor whether there is a need for contraception. 
Driving and using machines 
Sialanar may affect vision and co-ordination. This may affect performance at skilled tasks such as 
driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. After receiving Sialanar, the patient should not drive a 
vehicle, ride a bicycle or use a machine until the effect in their vision and co-ordination has 
completely recovered. Ask your doctor if you need further advice. 
Sialanar contains sodium and benzoate salt (E211) 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. This medicine contains 2.3 mg benzoate salt (E211) in each ml. 
3.   How to use Sialanar 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Children and adolescents 3 years to less than 18 years: 
Your doctor will decide the correct dose of Sialanar. The initial dose will be calculated based on the 
weight of the child.  Dose increases will be decided by the child’s doctor, using the table below as a 
guide, and will depend on both the effect of Sialanar and any side effects the patient is experiencing 
(this is why several dose levels appear in the table below). Section 4 includes possible side effects 
related to the use of Sialanar. These should be discussed with the child’s doctor at all medical 
consultations, including those for dose increases and decreases, and at any other time should you be 
concerned.  
The child should be monitored at regular intervals (at least every 3 months) to check that Sialanar is 
still the right treatment for them.

Give the dose prescribed by your doctor to the child three times each day. 
The dose should be given 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. 
It is important that the dose is given at consistent times in relation to food intake. Do not give with 
high fat foods. 
Route of administration 
Sialanar should be taken by mouth.  
Instructions for use 
How to use the oral syringe 
Remove the child-resistant closure from the bottle. 
Insert the syringe adaptor with the hole into the neck of the bottle (this may have been done already by 
the pharmacist). 
Insert the end of the oral syringe into the syringe adaptor and ensure it is secure. 
Hold the oral syringe in place and turn the bottle upside down. Gently pull down the plunger to the 
correct level (see the tables for the correct dose). Check you have the correct level. The maximum 
volume of the highest dose is 6 ml. 
Turn the bottle upright. 
Remove the oral syringe by holding the bottle and twisting the oral syringe gently. 
Place the oral syringe inside the child’s mouth and press the plunger slowly to gently release the 
medicine. 
After use, leave the syringe adaptor in the neck of the bottle. 
Replace the closure. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The oral syringe should be gently washed with warm water and allowed to dry after each use (i.e. three 
times per day). Do not use a dishwasher.

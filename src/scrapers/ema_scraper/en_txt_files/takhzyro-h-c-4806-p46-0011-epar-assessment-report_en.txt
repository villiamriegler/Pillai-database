1.  Introduction 
On 9 April 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Takhzyro, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. These data are also submitted as part of the 
post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study DX-2930-04 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
For each 300mg dose of lanadelumab, each subject received a total of 2 vials, each containing a 
nominal concentration of 150mg of lanadelumab active ingredient in 1mL solution. When Takhzyro 
became available, subjects transitioned to a single vial of 2mL solution (first subject transitioned on 02 
Aug 2018). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lanadelumab is a fully human, monoclonal antibody specifically inhibiting of active plasma kallikrein 
(pKal) activity.  
Plasma kallikrein is established as a relevant target for hereditary angioedema (HAE). In HAE, pKal 
activity is dysregulated due to the absence of C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), which results in the release of 
excess amounts of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator responsible for the characteristic HAE 
symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain. 
Lanadelumab (marketed as Takhzyro) is approved in a total of 40 countries globally including the 
United States, Canada, and the European Union (in 2018) for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks of 
HAE in patients 12 years and older. 
In procedure EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001, the MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study DX-2930-04: HELP Study Extension: An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Long-Term 
Safety and Efficacy of DX-2930 for Prevention Against Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) 
Study DX-2930-04 was part of the agreed paediatric investigational plan (PIP). Therefore, the current 
submission includes data from the aforementioned study, which has been completed in the last 6 
months, in order to comply with the requirements stipulated in Article 46 of the Paediatric Legislation 
(Regulation 1901/2006, as amended). 
Study DX-2930-04 is also listed as an additional pharmacovigilance activity category 3 PASS in the 
Takhzyro RMP. 
The current procedure assesses the MAH’s Responses to the questions included in the CHMP 
Assessment Report for Takhzyro Art. 46 procedure related to study DX-2930-04 
(EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001).

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
A summary of the assessment of study DX-2930-04 in procedure EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001 is 
presented here. For details, please refer to the Assessment Report for procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001. 
Efficacy 
Study DX-2930-04 was an open-label, long-term safety, and efficacy multicentre extension study of 
the pivotal study DX-2930-03 conducted in the US and Europe. Two types of subjects were enrolled 
into this study: rollovers from Study DX-2930-03 and non-rollovers (i.e., were not participants in 
Study DX-2930-03). There were no primary efficacy endpoints in the study. An interim analysis 
covering the first six months of Study DX-2930-04 was submitted and assessed in the MAA for 
Takhzyro.  
A total of 212 subjects were treated in the study, including 109 subjects that rolled over from DX-
2930-03 and 103 non-rollover subjects. Among them, 21 adolescent subjects (including 8 rollovers) 
were exposed to lanadelumab in Study DX-2930-04. 
For rollover patients treated with placebo in pivotal study DX-2930-03, there was a marked decrease in 
median HAE attack rate from 1.82 attacks/month at the end of the DX-2930-03 treatment period to 
0.06 attacks/month in the end of study DX-2930-04. This decrease in attack rate was consistent with 
the decrease in attack rate in the lanadelumab subjects during study DX-2930-03. The decrease in 
attack rate in the rollover lanadelumab subjects was maintained through study DX-2930-04. For the 
non-rollover subjects, data are presented by prior treatment (no long-term prophylaxis [LTP], LTP with 
C1-inhibitors [C1-INH], LTP with oral therapy or LTP with both C1-INH and oral therapy). The number 
of subjects in the two latter groups was small: N=9 and N=2, respectively. Regardless of prior 
treatment there was a marked decrease in attack rate from 1.54-1.84 attacks/month at baseline to 
0.00-0,15 attacks/month at the end of study DX-2930-04.  
The timeline for lanadelumab efficacy was also provided. The mean attack rate in the non-rollover 
population decreased from 2.55 attacks/month at baseline to 0.35 attacks/month after one month of 
treatment. At Month 30, the median HAE attack rate was 0.00 (min, max: 0.00, 2.9) in both 
populations. The mean (SD) HAE attack rate for the rollover population was 0.18 (0.55) and for the 
non-rollover population 0.19 (0.49). The number of subjects with data at Month 30 were 71/109 
(65%) and 82/103 (80%) for rollovers and non-rollovers, respectively. As mentioned elsewhere, the 
most common reason for discontinuing treatment was transition to commercial lanadelumab outside 
the study.  
Taken together these data confirm the results from pivotal study DX-2930-03 and support long term 
efficacy of lanadelumab. 
Demographic background, medical history and efficacy outcome were not presented separately for the 
21 paediatric subjects in the paediatric population. As the study is part of the PIP, the MAH was asked 
to present main data (discontinuation rate, demographics and baseline conditions, and mean HAE 
attack rate) for the paediatric population, the adult population and the total population separately, 
preferably in a comprehensive table. 
Self-administration of Takhzyro was allowed during the study; both at home and at a health care 
setting. The majority of the doses in the study were self-administered. 32% of all doses were self-
administered at home. This did not affect the effect on mean HAE attack rates. 
A secondary efficacy endpoint was patient-reported assessments of quality of life with the established 
AE-QoL assessment tool. The change observed in the AE-QoL total score was well over 6, which is the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

minimal clinically important difference (MCID) reported in the literature, in the patients not previously 
treated with lanadelumab. Self-reported symptom scales should be assessed with great caution in open 
label studies. Notwithstanding, the results are compatible with the improvements in HAE attack rate. 
Safety 
There were no deaths reported during the study.  
TEAE, SAE and discontinuations 
Any TEAE excluding HAE attack (non-HAE TEAE) was reported by 97% of the subjects overall, with no 
clinically relevant difference between rollovers and non-rollovers. In DX-2930-03, overall, 90% of the 
subjects reported any non-HAE TEAE. The proportion of subjects with non-HAE TEAE in DX-2930-04 
was however comparable to that in the 300 mg q2w arm of DX-2930-03 (97% and 96%, respectively). 
No separate information on TEAE in the paediatric population is given. The MAH was asked to provide a 
table similar to the table “Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Excluding HAE Attack 
Reported Events During the Treatment Period”) for subjects <18 years, ≥18 years and the total 
population separately. 
The most commonly reported non-HAE TEAE by preferred term in both DX-2930-04 and DX-2930-03 
were injections site pain (47%, 52% and 43% for DX-2930-04, DX-2930-03 300mg q2w population 
and DX-2930-03 total population, respectively), followed by viral upper respiratory tract infection 
(42%, 37%, 24%), upper respiratory tract infection (26%, NA, NA) and headache (24%, 33%, 20%). 
Headache is further discussed below.  
A total of 116 (55%) subjects had 2,120 related non-HAE TEAEs. The vast majority of related non-HAE 
TEAEs were reported in the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions (2,090/2,120 
events). Of these, all but seven events represented different forms of injection site reactions. The 
proportion of subjects with related non-HAE TEAE in DX-2930-03 was 60% in the overall study 
population and 70% in the 300 mg q2w arm.  
The paediatric population comprises 10% of the total study population (21/212 subjects). Of the 2,120 
reported related non-HAE TEAE, 251 events (6%) were reported in the paediatric population. Thus, 
there are no indications that adverse events related to lanadelumab treatment were more common in 
this population. 250/251 events in the paediatric population represented injection site reactions.  
A total of 21 subjects (9.9%) had 31 serious non-HAE TEAE. None of the serious TEAEs were assessed 
by investigators as related to lanadelumab. At preferred term (PT)-level, most SAEs were reported only 
for one single subject. Even though a causal association is often difficult to fully exclude, such an 
association is considered less probable in most of the cases, as other explications were more plausible. 
In summary, the list of SAEs in study DX-2930-04 does not indicate any new and unexpected safety 
risk with lanadelumab. 
Six subjects discontinued from the study due to TEAEs. The events leading to discontinuation were 
hypersensitivity (3), elevated liver enzymes (2) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding following ingestion 
of a caustic substance. The events of hypersensitivity were assessed as related to lanadelumab by the 
Investigator. This is agreed; however, elevated liver enzymes are labelled in section 4.8 and a causal 
association is therefore at least possible in one of the cases. In the other case, the elevated liver 
enzymes were reported just prior to the first lanadelumab dose.

Specific issues 
Based on both the known safety profile of lanadelumab, missing safety information and a safety signal, 
the following adverse events are discussed in greater detail below: Injection site reactions, headache, 
pregnancy, hypersensitivity, disordered coagulation, elevated liver enzymes and immunogenicity.  
In total, 55% of the subjects in DX-2930-04 reported at least one TEAE of injection site reaction. No 
events were serious, and none led to discontinuation. Injection site reactions are labelled with the 
frequency “very common” in section 4.8. 
During the reporting period for the second six-month PSUSA for lanadelumab (23 February 2019 to 22 
August 2019; EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010743/201908), a safety signal of headache was identified by the 
MAH. The MAH reviewed, refuted and closed the signal with no proposed changes to the SmPC. The 
PRAC agreed that based on the non-serious nature of the headache cases, it was sufficient to closely 
monitor the signal of headache. The MAH was also to provide a cumulative analysis of clinical trial data 
through data base lock of 19 December 2019 in DX-2930-04 study and post-marketing data of 
headache for current interval period (23 August 2019 to 22 February 2020) in the third six-month 
PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010743/202002). No additional measures were undertaken based on 
data presented in the PSUSA dated 202002. However, the PRAC Rapporteur, stated that 
“Reassessment of the signal of headache is expected after the end of the open label extension study”. 
Overall, 118 subjects reported 120 events of headache including related PTs as adverse events in DX-
2930-04. 78% of the events were reported more than three days after the injection. The same 
information was presented also in the PSUSA 202002. Thus, no additional data on headache has 
emerged from Study DX-2930-04 compared to the cumulative review assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010743/202002. No post-marketing data has been provided with the current 
procedure. As no new information is available in this current procedure, there is no ground to 
reconsider the recommendation in procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010743/202002, that no new safety 
related updates to the product information related to headache is warranted. It is considered adequate 
to continue monitoring headache by routine pharmacovigilance and in upcoming PSUSAs. 
The results from study DX-2930-04 do not warrant any update of the current wording of section 4.6 of 
the approved Takhzyro SmPC. 
No anaphylaxis and no anaphylactoid reactions were observed during the study. The risk of 
Hypersensitivity is reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
At the MAA of Takhzyro, it was noted that in study DX-2930-03, activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) was well balanced between groups at baseline. However, a dose-dependent increase in aPTT 
appeared from the first measurement after study start, i.e. day 28. These changes were then 
maintained throughout the study period up to day 182. The changes from baseline were in line with 
what can be predicted from primary pharmacology and were considered to be due to an interaction of 
lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. This is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
All bleeding events except two were reported in one single subject. Vaginal bleeding was reported in 
two subjects, however, was associated with adenomyosis in one of the subjects. Six episodes of 
epistaxis were reported, all in the same subject. Nevertheless, the MAH was asked to provide a 
comprehensive summary, preferably as a table, of bleeding parameters at the time for the event, 
including aPTT, in all subjects reporting a bleeding event. 
Three events associated with thromboembolic events were reported (thrombosis, Transient ischaemic 
attack and Cerebrovascular Accident). After assessing the narratives, it is agreed with the MAH that in 
none of the SAE associated with thromboembolic events, a causal association to lanadelumab 
treatment is considered probable.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Shift from normal liver enzyme levels at baseline to 1 to <3×ULN was reported in 25% of the patients 
for ALT and 22% of the subjects for AST. Seven subjects (3.3%) had at least one ALT value >3 x ULN. 
The same number of subjects had at least one AST value >3 x ULN. No subjects met the criteria for 
the Hy’s law cases.  
Five subjects had liver-related test results that led to interruption (n=2) or withdrawal of lanadelumab 
treatment (n=3). The remaining subjects with elevated liver enzymes continued treatment with 
lanadelumab. 
Alanine aminotransferase increased and Aspartate aminotransferase increased are labelled in section 
4.8 with frequency common. This is considered adequate. 
During Study DX-2930-04, six subjects developed neutralising anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at least at 
one timepoint. After having assessed the narratives for these six subjects as summarised above, it is 
agreed with the MAH, that this does not seem to have had any impact on the efficacy of lanadelumab. 
One of the six subjects with neutralising antibodies was a boy. This was the only subject from the 
paediatric population reporting neutralising antibodies. 
2.3.3.  Assessment of the MAH’s responses to the question in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001 
Question 1 
Demographic background, medical history and efficacy outcome were not presented separately for the 
21 paediatric subjects in the paediatric population. As Study DX-2930-04 is part of the PIP, the MAH is 
asked to present main data (discontinuation rate, demographics and baseline conditions, and mean 
HAE attack rate) for the paediatric population, the adult population and the total population separately, 
preferably in a comprehensive table 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and mean HAE attack rate are presented in 
Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 below for the paediatric, adult, and total populations 
separately.

Table 5: Mean HAE Attack Rates 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The MAH has provided demographic background, medical history and efficacy outcome separately for 
the 21 paediatric subjects in the paediatric population. 
HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening were eligible for the study. The 
mean age in the paediatric population was 14.3 year, ranging from 12 to 18 years of age. Compared to 
the adult population, there were a higher proportion of male subjects (52% in the paediatric vs 30% in 
the adult population. The demographic characteristics were otherwise similar between the two

populations. In the adult population 75% of the subjects did not complete the study compared to 62% 
(13/20) in the paediatric population. 12/13 paediatric subjects not completing the study transitioned to 
the commercial product and one was lost to follow-up, indicating a high adherence to treatment in this 
population.  
There was a clear difference in disease activity between the paediatric and the adult populations. In 
the paediatric population, 38% had experienced laryngeal attacks vs 64% in the adult population. The 
mean (min, max) Historical number of attacks in the last 3 months was 4.9 (1, 20) and 9.9 (0, 90) for 
the paediatric and adult populations , respectively, and the Baseline HAE attack rate (attacks/4 weeks) 
(mean [min, max]) was 1.6 (0, 4) vs 3.2 (0, 15).  
The mean (SD) change HAE attack rate in attacks/month (primary endpoint) was -1.47 (0.896) in the 
total paediatric population. This corresponds to a percentage change from baseline of -95% in the 
paediatric population vs -87% in the total adult population.  
In summary, there is no indication of a different efficacy outcome in the paediatric population (N=21) 
in Study DX-2930-04 compared to what is previously documented for Takhzyro.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 2 
No separate information on TEAE in the paediatric population is given. The MAH is asked to provide a 
table similar to the table “Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Excluding HAE Attack 
Reported Events During the Treatment Period”) for subjects <18 years, ≥18 years and the total 
population separately. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
A summary of TEAEs, excluding HAE attacks, is presented below for the paediatric, adult, and total 
population separately

Table 6: Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Excluding HAE Attack Reported Events) 
During the Treatment Period (Safety Population) 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The MAH has provided a summary of TEAEs, excluding HAE attacks, for the paediatric, adult, and total 
population separately.  
The total subject treatment time was markedly lower in the paediatric population (52 vs 429 patient-
years), which make numerical comparisons of adverse events in the two populations difficult.  
There were no meaningful differences in the proportion of subjects with any TEAE. One subject in the 
paediatric population, a female, was reported with serious AEs (suicide ideation and major depression). 
These events were not considered related to treatment by the MAH.  
In summary, there is no indication of a different safety profile in the paediatric population (N=21) in 
Study DX-2930-04 compared to what is previously documented for Takhzyro.

Question 3 
The MAH is asked to provide a comprehensive summary, preferably as a table, of bleeding parameters 
at the time for the event, including aPTT, in all subjects reporting a bleeding event. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
For this analysis, the bleeding TEAE events were identified using SMQ-defined criteria as defined in the 
DX-2930-04 SAP. The bleeding parameters activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin 
time (PT), and prothrombin international ratio (INR) were assessed within 14 days prior to the bleeding 
event and 14 days after a bleeding event was identified. The baseline, actual, and change from 
baseline values for these measurements were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
Since each individual subject might have multiple bleeding events, and each bleeding event might have 
multiple bleeding parameter measurements within a ±14-day window, the following data handling 
approach was used: 
Baseline Summary: The baseline summary for all bleeding parameters is a subject level summary. 
Only subjects who had a measurement of a particular bleeding parameter(s) within the ±14-day 
window of the bleeding event are included. The baseline parameter is defined as the last non-missing 
value prior to the first exposure to the study drug (for rollover subjects, this is the baseline in the DX-
2930-03 study, and for DX-2930-04 study subjects, this is the value before the first dose in the DX-
2930-04 study). 
Actual Value and Change from Baseline Summary: The actual value and change from baseline 
summaries are an event-level summary. All bleeding parameter measurements within ±14 days of a 
bleeding event are included. If there were multiple measurements for a particular bleeding parameter, 
the measurement closest to the date of the bleeding event was used in the analysis. If the bleeding 
parameter measurement was taken on the same day as the bleeding event, and the time of the 
bleeding event or bleeding parameter measurement was missing, then the bleeding parameter 
measurement was considered to be taken after the bleeding event. 
Table 7 provides a summary of the bleeding parameters ±14 days of an SMQ-defined bleeding event in 
Study DX-2930-04. The same parameters from the total population in the study are included in the 
table as reference. 
To further differentiate systemic and local bleeding events, subsets of bleeding events that were either 
injection site related bleeding events or non-injection site related bleeding events were identified. A 
summary of these results can be found in Module 5.3.5.2 (not included for the sake of conciseness). 
A total of 52 subjects with 161 SMQ-defined bleeding events with a clear event date were identified in 
the analysis. As shown in Table 7, baseline mean values of aPTT, PT and INR were similar between 
subjects with the bleeding events and the total study population. Actual and mean changes in these 
parameters, before and after the bleeding events during the treatment period, were also comparable 
to the reference values from the total subjects in this study. In addition, similar observations were 
found in separate analyses based on injection site SMQ-defined bleeding events and non-injection site 
bleeding events (not included for the sake of conciseness).

Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
aPTT, PT and INR before and after the bleeding events during the treatment period, were comparable 
in 52 subjects with 161 SMQ-defined bleeding events to the reference values from the total subjects in 
this study. There is thus no indication that the bleeding events were related to any alterations in these 
bleeding parameters. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
During the assessment of Study DX-2930-04 in procedure EMEA/H/C/004806/P46/001, there were

of the Paediatric Legislation and the additional pharmacovigilance activity category 3 PASS could be 
considered fulfilled. These issues are addressed in the current procedure.  
The MAH has provided demographic background, medical history and efficacy outcome separately for 
the 21 paediatric subjects in the paediatric population. 
HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening were eligible for the study. The 
mean age in the paediatric population was 14.3 year, ranging from 12 to 18 years of age. Compared to 
the adult population, there were a higher proportion of male subjects (52% in the paediatric vs 30% in 
the adult population). The demographic characteristics were otherwise similar between the two 
populations. In the adult population, 75% of the subjects did not complete the study compared to 62% 
(13/20) in the paediatric population. 12/13 paediatric subjects not completing the study transitioned to 
the commercial product and one was lost to follow-up, indicating a high adherence to treatment in this 
population.  
There was a clear difference in disease activity between the paediatric and the adult populations with 
Baseline HAE attack rate (attacks/4 weeks) (mean [min, max]) 1.6 (0, 4) vs 3.2 (0, 15) for the 
paediatric and adult populations, respectively. The mean (SD) change HAE attack rate in 
attacks/month (primary endpoint) was -1.47 (0.896) in the total paediatric population. This 
corresponds to a percentage change from baseline of -95% in the paediatric population vs -87% in the 
total adult population.  
The MAH also provided a summary of TEAEs, excluding HAE attacks, for the paediatric, adult, and total 
population separately.  
The total subject treatment time was markedly lower in the paediatric population (52 vs 429 patient-
years), which make numerical comparisons of adverse events in the two populations difficult. However, 
there were no meaningful differences in the proportion of subjects with any TEAE. One subject in the 
paediatric population, a female, was reported with serious AEs (suicide ideation and major depression). 
These events were not considered related to treatment by the MAH.  
In summary, there is no indication of a different outcome of efficacy parameters or a different safety 
profile in the paediatric population in Study DX-2930-04 compared to what is previously documented 
for Takhzyro. 
The MAH provided data on aPTT, PT and INR before and after the bleeding events during the treatment 
period, showing comparable levels in 52 subjects with SMQ-defined bleeding events to the reference 
values from the total subjects in this study. There is thus no indication that the bleeding events were 
related to any alterations in these bleeding parameters.  
Takhzyro is currently indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema 
(HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. It is agreed with the MAH that no update of the PIL or other 
actions are warranted. The B/R for Takhzyro in the approved indication is considered unchanged.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Anagrelide Mylan 
anagrelide 
On 14 December 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Anagrelide 
Mylan, intended for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential thrombocythaemia 
patients. The applicant for this medicinal product is Mylan S.A.S. 
Anagrelide Mylan will be available as 0.5 mg and 1 mg hard capsules. The active substance of Anagrelide 
Mylan is anagrelide, an antineoplastic agent (ATC code: L01XX35). The precise mechanism by which 
anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is unknown. Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP 
phosphodiesterase III. 
Anagrelide Mylan is a generic and hybrid of Xagrid (0.5 mg hard capsules), which has been authorised in 
the EU since 16 November 2004. Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Anagrelide Mylan, 
and its bioequivalence to the reference product Xagrid. A question and answer document on generic 
medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
"Anagrelide is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential thrombocythaemia 
(ET) patients who are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet counts are not 
reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. 
An at risk patient 
An at risk essential thrombocythaemia patient is defined by one or more of the following features: 
•  > 60 years of age or 
• 
• 
a platelet count > 1,000 x 109/l or 
a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events." 
It is proposed that Anagrelide Mylan be prescribed by a clinician with experience in the management of 
essential thrombocythaemia.

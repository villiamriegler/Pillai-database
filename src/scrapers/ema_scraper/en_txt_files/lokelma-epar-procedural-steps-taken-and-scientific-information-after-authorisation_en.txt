The MAH submitted with this variation an updated 
information on constipation to the summary of safety 
profile and to add constipation to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency Common 
based on literature review and MAH safety database. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) based on 
completed Lokelma studies with a study design including 
maintenance treatment of hyperkalaemia. Results obtained 
from this literature review and from the MAH safety 
database showed increased risk of constipation. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

Lokelma in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. The product 
information was updated in accordance with the latest QRD

The MAH submitted with this variation an update of the 
drug-drug interaction information based on final 
report for interventional study D9480C00012, “A 
Two-Cohort, Randomised Sequence, Crossover, 
Open-label Study to Assess the Effect of a Single 
Dose of Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) on the 
Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus and Cyclosporin in 
Healthy Subjects”. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, MAH is also taking this 
opportunity to update the contact details of the local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) based on the 
final results of study D9480C00012. As a result, section 
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction has been reviewed to indicate that in 
another drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers, 
co-administration of Lokelma 15 g with tacrolimus 5 mg 
resulted in a decreased tacrolimus AUC and Cmax by 37% 
and 29% respectively. Therefore, tacrolimus should be 
taken at least 2 hours before or after Lokelma. In the same 
study, co-administration of Lokelma and cyclosporin did not 
show a clinically meaningful interaction.

SmPC, 
In this study, 196 patients (mean age 58 years, range 20 
order to update the clinical information based final 
Labelling and 
to 86 years) with end stage renal disease on stable dialysis 
results from study DIALIZE. This was a Phase 3b, 
multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, 
PL 
for at least 3 months and persistent pre dialysis 
hyperkalaemia were randomised to receive Lokelma 5 g or 
Page 4/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and 
efficacy of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients 
with hyperkalaemia and on chronic haemodialysis. 
The Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. The 
RMP version 2.2 has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation Holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to implement the new 
excipient statement for sodium in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC, section 2 of Labelling and section 2 of the 
Package Leaflet. Furthermore, minor editorial 
changes were introduced in section 2 of the Package 
leaflet.

placebo once daily on non dialysis days. The proportion of 
responders, defined as those subjects who maintained a 
pre dialysis serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L 
on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after Long 
interdialytic interval (3-day interval [Friday/Saturday to 
Monday/Tuesday] in thrice weekly dialysis scheme) and 
who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation 
period, was 41% in the Lokelma group, and 1% in the 
placebo group (p < 0.001). The shorth term safety data 
from the study did not raise any new safety concerns. 
Based on those data, the SmPC section 4.2 (dosing 
recommendations) have been updated as follows: 
• 
• 
Lokelma should only be dosed on non dialysis days.  
The recommended starting dose is 5 g once daily. 
To establish normokalaemia (4.0-5.0 mmol/L), the dose 
may be titrated up or down weekly based on the pre 
dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter dialytic 
interval (LIDI).  
• 
The dose could be adjusted at intervals of one 
week in increments of 5 g up to 15 g once daily on non-
dialysis days.  
• 
It is recommended to monitor serum potassium 
weekly while the dose is adjusted; once normokalaemia is 
established, potassium should be monitored regularly (e.g. 
monthly, or more frequently based on clinical judgement 
including changes in dietary potassium or medication 
affecting serum potassium). 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
information on sodium content in the SmPC to inform 
prescribers that Lokelma is considered high in sodium and 
this should be particularly considered for those on a low 
salt diet.

The  MAH  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  submitted  an 
application to introduce an additional pack size of 5 vials of powder and solvent for solution for 
injection. A favourable opinion was adopted by the CPMP on 17 July 1996, which required an 
update of the Annexes of the Commission Decision. 
The  MAH  submitted  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  an 
application for a Type II variation to amend the text of the SPC and PL in the light of the first 
PSUR data: strengthening the warnings on the injection site necrosis. A favourable opinion on a 
modified text was adopted by the CPMP on 20 November 1996. 
Pursuant  to  Article  13(2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No  2309/93  and  part  4G  of  Annex  to 
Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  provided  in  the 
foreseen timeframe the reports of ongoing studies according to the specific obligations stated in 
the Annex II of the Decision. The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA the 
documentation,  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  benefit/risk  profile 
for Betaferon, including an updated expert report summarising the different specific obligations 
already submitted within the period November 1995- November 1996. The Rapporteur’s annual 
assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  20  January  1997.  During  the 
February  1997  plenary  meeting,  the  CPMP  agreed  with  the  Rapporteur’s  assessment  report, 
reviewed  the  specific  obligations  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  and  finalised  the 
annual risk benefit assessment, which remained unchanged. The marketing authorisation should 
therefore remain under exceptional circumstances. On this basis a positive opinion was adopted

Annexes I and III to the Community Marketing Authorisation were necessary.

1995.  The  response  to  this  specific  obligation  has  resulted  in  a  type  I  variation  in  accordance 
with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  for  which  the  CPMP  adopted  a  favourable 
opinion in its 19 February 1997 plenary meeting. 
The  MAH  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  I  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 to introduce a change in the manufacture of the medicinal product 
with the addition of a final filtration step. A positive opinion was adopted by the CPMP in its 
February 1997 plenary meeting.

derived medium to be used in the manufacture of the medicinal product (medium for the growth 
of  the  working  cell  bank).  The  CPMP  adopted  a  favourable  opinion  on  this  variation  on  19 
March 1997.

Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, relating to changes in the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet, to reflect a better understanding of the safety profile based on the review of the 
third Periodic Safety Update Report. The CPMP adopted a favourable opinion on this variation 
on 22 October 1997. 
Pursuant  to  Article  13(2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No  2309/93  and  part  4G  of  Annex  to 
Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  provided  in  the 
foreseen timeframe the reports of ongoing studies according to the specific obligations stated in 
the Annex II of the Decision. The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA the 
documentation,  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  2nd  annual  re-assessment  of  the  benefit/risk

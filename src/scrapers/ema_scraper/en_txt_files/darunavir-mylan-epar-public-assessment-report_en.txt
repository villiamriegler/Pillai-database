1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant MYLAN S.A.S. submitted on 31 July 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Darunavir Mylan, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) 
of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004– ‘Generic of a Centrally authorised product’. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 September 2014 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and refers to a reference product for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on 
the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3)of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Darunavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. 
Darunavir Mylan 75 mg, 150mg, 300mg, 600mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see 
section 4.2): 
● 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult 
patients, including those that have been highly pre-treated. 
● 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 3 
years and at least 15 kg body weight. 
In deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful consideration 
should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated 
with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide 
the use of Darunavir Mylan. 
Darunavir Mylan 400mg and 800mg tablets, co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with 
other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection 
in adult patients (see section 4.2).  
Darunavir Mylan 400mg and 800 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg body 
weight who are:  
●       antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2).  
●       ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have plasma 
HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In deciding to initiate treatment 
with darunavir in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic testing should guide the use of darunavir (see 
sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This condition progressively reduces the effectiveness of the immune 
system and leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumours. HIV is transmitted through 
direct contact of a mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, 
semen, vaginal fluid, pre-seminal fluid, and breast milk. This transmission can involve anal, vaginal or oral 
sex, blood transfusion, contaminated hypodermic needles, exchange between mother and baby during 
pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids. During replication in 
the HIV life-cycle, gag and gag-pol gene products are produced as precursor polyproteins which are 
subsequently processed by a virally encoded protease to provide structural proteins (p17, p24, p9 and p7) 
and essential viral enzymes, including protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). All three 
retroviral enzymes have been identified as potential drug targets. Specifically, the critical function of HIV 
protease has made it an important target for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.   
Current treatment for HIV infection consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART. This has been 
highly beneficial to many HIV-infected individuals since its introduction in 1996 when the protease inhibitor-
based HAART initially became available. Current optimal HAART options consist of combinations (or 
"cocktails") consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or "classes," of antiretroviral 
agents.  Currently typical regimens consist of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus 
either a protease inhibitor, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase inhibitor 
(INSTI).   Since the advent of the first PI, saquinavir, a number of PIs have been introduced in the regimens 
of highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART. Thus improved HAART regimens have shown reduced viral 
load, increased CD4+ T-cell counts and drastically lowered AIDS related deaths in the US and industrialized 
nations.  Standard goals of HAART include improvement in the patient’s quality of life, reduction in 
Assessment report

complications, and reduction of HIV viremia below the limit of detection, but it does not cure the patient of 
HIV nor does it prevent the return, once treatment is stopped, of high blood levels of HIV, often HAART 
resistant. For some patients, which can be more than fifty percent of patients, HAART achieves far less than 
optimal results, due to medication intolerance/side effects, prior ineffective antiretroviral therapy and 
infection with a drug-resistant strain of HIV. Non-adherence and non-persistence with therapy are the major 
reasons why some people do not benefit from HAART. The reasons for non-adherence and non-persistence 
are varied. Major psychosocial issues include poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, 
psychiatric disease and drug abuse. HAART regimens can also be complex and thus hard to follow, with large 
numbers of pills taken frequently. Side effects can also deter people from persisting with HAART; these 
include, dyslipidaemia, diarrhoea, insulin resistance, an increase in cardiovascular risks and birth defects. 
Anti-retroviral drugs are expensive, and the majority of the world's infected individuals do not have access to 
medications and treatments for HIV and AIDS. 
As the number of agents that are used to treat HIV increases, the decisions regarding which antiretroviral 
agents to select in each clinical setting become more complex. The choice of the components of the regimen 
for patients who have an extensive treatment history relies on a careful assessment of (1) that past 
treatment history, (2) the response to prior agents, and (3) the results of past and current resistance tests 
(Haubrich R., 2007). 
Darunavir is a second-generation PI that has been initially approved in treatment-experienced and -naive 
patients with a *00 mg q.d posology in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir. At the dose of 600 mg 
combined with 100-mg ritonavir b.i.d., it has demonstrated substantial virologic and immunologic responses 
in treatment-experienced patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, and the responses were greater than those 
seen in the control PI/ritonavir arm. In addition, darunavir/ritonavir added as a full active drug with two 
active drugs raltegravir and etravirine in heavily previously treated patients from the TRIO study has shown 
high rates of viral suppression. Furthermore, the rates of virologic suppression were comparable to those 
expected in treatment-naive patients (Phung BC et al., 2011).  Darunavir when used without ritonavir have 
inadequate bioavailability and should never be used as unboosted PIs (Boyd SD et al., 2011). 
Darunavir is an HIV protease inhibitor for use in combination therapy of HIV infection in previously treated 
adults. Darunavir has the advantage of retaining virological activity in the presence of multiple protease 
mutations. It is coadministered with low-dose ritonavir, which increases its bioavailability. It should also be 
taken with food to increase its absorption. Adverse effects are comparable with other protease inhibitors and 
include diarrhea, nausea, headache, and increased aminotransferase activity and serum lipid concentrations. 
Since darunavir is an inhibitor and substrate of CYP3A, it can increase serum concentrations of other drugs 
metabolized by this enzyme and its own metabolism may be affected by inducers or inhibitors of it (Eric 
Scholar., 2009). 
This application is for a generic form of darunavir in strength of 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg 
and 800 mg. This is an abridged application submitted under Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC. An 
abridged application is appropriate since the product in this application is essentially similar to the existing 
licensed product namely ‘PREZISTA’ (darunavir ethanolate) film-coated Tablets. The active ingredient and the 
route of administration are the same for both products. In addition, the proposed SPC for the applicant’s 
Darunavir has been based on the ‘PREZISTA’ (darunavir ethanolate) film coated Tablets.

hypromellose, magnesium stearate. 
Tablet Film-coating:  polyvinyl alcohol partially hydrolysed, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc.  
The product is available in cold form PVC/Al/OPA-Al blister, PVC/PE/PVDC-Al blister and HDPE bottle with PP 
screw cap as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of darunavir is (1S, 2R)-3-[[(4-amino-phenyl)sulfonyl](2-methylpropyl)amino-2-hydroxy-
1-(phenylmethyl)propyl]carbamic acid (3R, 3aS, 6aR)-hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]-furan-3-yl ester corresponding 
to the molecular formula C 27H37N3O7S. It has a relative molecular mass of 547.66 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1.  Structure of Darunavir 
Darunavir is a white to light brown colour slightly hygroscopic powder, very slightly soluble in aqueous 
solutions, freely soluble in acetone, sparklingly soluble in ethyl acetate.  
Darunavir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. One chiral centre originates in 
a starting material, whilst the others are generated during the process. The synthetic strategy and process 
design such as the starting material and reagent selection, process parameters, and in-process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/851324/2016

ensure the desired configuration at each of the five chiral centres. The darunavir enantiomer (also called 
isomer 7) and the isomers 8-15 are combinations of two isomers of synthesis intermediates (DRV-II and 
DRV-IIA). It was considered unlikely that these isomers are formed. Hence they are not controlled in the final 
active substance. The isomers 1-5 are monitored routinely in active substance specifications.  The isomer-6 
content was below the detection limit in three darunavir production scale batches. Therefore, its control is not 
included in the active substance specification.  
Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  darunavir.  The  literature  states  that  darunavir  exists  as  ethanolate, 
hydrate  and  amorphous  forms.  The  amorphous  form  is  consistently  produced  by  the  active  substance 
manufacturer. Amorphous form control has been included in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
A single source of active substance is used although in total three manufacturers are used, responsible for 
different steps. 
Darunavir is synthesised in 3 main parts each of them involving several steps. Two well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications are used in the synthesis. One originally-proposed starting material 
was re-defined during the procedure at the request of CHMP to ensure that enough of the process is 
conducted under GMP.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Darunavir is characterized by IR, UV, NMR, mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and XRD. Further data 
were provided to confirm the absolute configuration of darunavir active substance and its enantiomeric 
purity. Darunavir is amorphous in nature and the development of single crystals is not possible. Hence 
crystallographic studies were attempted on the darunavir crystalline which is n-1 stage for darunavir 
amorphous. However no suitable crystals were obtained, hence crystallographic studies were performed on 
darunavir ethanolate which were grown from ethanol by slow evaporation method. The obtained single 
crystal XRD data confirmed the stereochemistry of darunavir at chiral centres is C(3)-R, C(3A)-S, C(6A)-R, 
C(11)-S and C(19)-R. The ASMF holder also identified the absolute stereochemistry of a darunavir 
enantiomer using the circular dichroism (CD) technique. Specific optical rotation (SOR) data of darunavir 
enantiomer, darunavir amorphous in-house working standard and three darunavir validation batches were 
compared. The CD analysis and SOR data confirmed the absolute configuration of darunavir enantiomer as 
dextrorotatory i.e (S) or (+) and darunavir amorphous as levorotatory i.e (R) or (-).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The active substance is first packed in translucent LDPE bag, securely folded and twist-tied with a plastic 
rope.  The LDPE bag complies with the EC Regulation 1282/2011. The latter is placed in another translucent 
polyethylene bag (HMLDPE), which is flushed with nitrogen. It is surrounded by silica gel and molecular

sieves, and then heat sealed. The translucent polyethylene bag (HMLDPE) is placed in a triple laminated 
aluminium bag, flushed with nitrogen, surrounded by silica gel and molecular sieves, and then heat sealed. 
The triple laminated bag is put into HDPE drum. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification (HPLC, IR), water 
content (KF), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph.Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), chiral 
purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), palladium content (AAS), polymorph identification (PXRD) and particle 
size (laser diffraction).  
The analytical procedures used by the finished product manufacturer to test the active substance are 
identical to those of the active substance manufacturer. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented.  
Batch analysis for four production scale batches and two pilot scale batches of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data were provided on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
supplier stored in the intended commercial packaging for 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines.  
The parameters description, identification by IR, HPLC and XRD, water content, related substances, assay, 
and chiral purity have been investigated. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
demonstrated to be stability indicating by forced degradation studies. 
During long-term and accelerated conditions no significant changes have been observed. All results were 
within specifications.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the retest period of 36 months when stored in the proposed container 
below 30°C under nitrogen atmosphere as proposed by the ASMF holder. However the applicant follows a 
retest period shorter than the one proposed by the ASMF holder for the active substance. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product comes as white to off-white, oval shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets available in six 
strengths; 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg.  
The aim was to develop a stable and robust formulation, bioequivalent to the reference product Prezista. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards 
Assessment report  
EMA/851324/2016 
Page 13/40 
 
  
  
 
with the exception of the film coating opadry II, although it is composed of a mixture of compendial 
components. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The formulation of the proposed 
product differs from the reference medicinal product in the active substance form. In the reference product 
the solvate form (ie darunavir (as ethanolate) is used whereas in the proposed finished product the 
amorphous form is used. The reference product does not contain the binder hypromellose (except in the 
800mg strength) nor the disintegrant sodium starch glycollate but does contain sunset yellow FCF for the 
400mg and 600mg strengths. The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients used in the 
proposed finished product has been adequately demonstrated. The roles, the choice of the excipients and 
their concentrations have been satisfactorily justified. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same 
as that intended for marketing. 
The finished product is also for paediatric use, for paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 
kg body weight. Tablets dimensions are similar to the ones of the reference product. As it is the case for the 
reference product, the proposed 800 mg tablet is of the same size as the 600mg tablet in order not to be too 
large to be swallowed.   
The 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg tablet strengths are fully dose/weight proportional.  The 
800mg tablet strengths is not dose/weight proportional with the other strengths.  
The similarity of the developed product with the reference product was assessed by comparison of dissolution 
and impurity profiles and by bioequivalence (BE) studies.  
Two bioequivalence studies were performed with the 600 mg and 800mg strengths showing bioequivalence 
between the proposed finished product and the reference medicinal product. 
A bio-waiver was requested for the other strengths based on the result from BE-study with 600 mg strength. 
All the conditions for bio-waiver for additional product strengths as stated in the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) are fulfilled. Comparative dissolution profile was 
performed. Initially, the applicant submitted comparative dissolution profiles obtained with a dissolution 
method using a surfactant and a rotation speed of 75 rpm instead of 50 rpm. Following CHMP request to 
provide dissolution data in accordance with the Guideline on Bioequivalence, new dissolution data were 
provided at pH 3.0, 4.5 and 6.8 without the use of surfactant but using a 75 rpm rotation speed. CHMP 
requested dissolution data at pH 1.2 instead of pH 3.0 and a justification for the use of a rotation speed of 75 
rpm instead of 50 rpm in line with the Guideline on Bioequivalence requirements.  The applicant submitted 
comparative dissolution profiles at pH 1.2 and justified the use of the 75 rpm rotation speed by the fact that 
incomplete active substance release was observed at 50 rpm paddle agitation speed. The CHMP considered 
that incomplete drug release was not a justification to use a higher rotation speed, as it is not a criterion 
which may hamper comparability evaluation in dissolution. As the use of a higher rotation speed may result 
in a lower discriminatory power at the tested pH conditions, the applicant was requested to submit new 
dissolution data in pH 1.2, pH 4.5, pH 6.8 using a paddle speed of 50 rpm. The data provided showed 
similarity of the dissolution profiles at pH 1.2 but a lack of similarity between the bio-batch strength and the 
75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg strengths in pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 buffers. The lack of similarity at in pH 4.5 and pH 
6.8 was justified by the very poor solubility of the active substance which leads to poor sink conditions. For 
the 600mg strength of the finished product lower active substance release was observed compared to the 
other strengths of the finished product. Due to the poor sink conditions the applicant performed comparative 
dissolution testing at “same dose” in pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 buffers using a rotation speed of 50rpm. The 
similarity factor was greater than 50 for the “same dose” dissolution study. Therefore the dissolution profiles 
of all these batches were considered similar. Dissolution studies between the bio-batch strength and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/851324/2016 
Page 14/40 
 
  
  
additional strengths at 50rpm with surfactant also demonstrated similar profiles since more than 85% is 
dissolved within 15 minutes or f2 similarity factor was more than 50. Based on the dissolution data provided 
the applicant’s request for a bio-waiver for the 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg strengths of the test 
product was considered acceptable. 
The development of the dissolution method is described and the discriminatory power has been 
demonstrated. It is also considered that the applicant has adequately justified the choice of agitation speed 
and concentration of surfactant used in the dissolution method. 
The impurity profiles of both generic and reference products in all strengths are similar. 
Data demonstrating polymorphic stability during finished product manufacture and storage were provided 
and considered satisfactory. 
The primary packaging is cold form PVC/Al/OPA-Al blisters, PVC/PE/PVDC-Al blisters and HDPE bottles with a 
PP screw cap. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: sifting, granulation, drying, dry screening, sifting of 
extra granular materials, blending, compression, coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three pilot scale 
batches of each strength. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Process validation will be performed post-approval on the first three consecutive production scale batches of 
each strength. An acceptable validation plan has been provided. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:  appearance, 
identification (HPLC, UV),  colour identification (titanium dioxide test), dissolution (UV), uniformity of dosage 
units  (mass  variation,  Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  water  (KF)  and  microbiological 
test (Ph. Eur). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 3 pilot scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Assessment report

Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 3 pilot scale batches of each strength of finished product stored according to 
the ICH guidelines: 
- under long term conditions for up to 12 months for blister and 24 months for HDPE bottle at 25 ºC / 60% 
RH (all strengths except 800 mg) 
- under long term conditions for up to 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate conditions for 12 
months at 30 ºC / 75% RH (800mg tablet only, all packaging,) 
- under accelerated conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH (all strengths, all packaging) .  
The batches used are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the three primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. 
In addition, batches packaged in PVC/PE/PVdC blister and 100’s HDPE bottle were exposed to light as defined 
in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New active Substances and Products. 
In-use stability studies were performed on two batches of the 800 mg strength packaged in 90’s HDPE bottle 
pack. In-use stability studies were also performed on two batches of two extreme strengths ie 75 mg and 
600mg packaged in 100’s HDPE bottle. In-line with CPMP guidance – Note for Guidance on In-use stability 
testing of human medicinal products - CPMP/QWP/2934/99, justification has been provided that the in-use 
stability of the 75 mg and 600 mg film-coated tablets can be extended to other middle strengths (ie 
darunavir 150 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets) and that the containers size used to conduct the 
studies represents the worst case scenario in terms of head space to fill volume ratio. The sampling and 
methodology of the in-use studies were described and considered acceptable. 
Stability samples were tested for description, assay, dissolution, related substances, water, and 
microbiological quality. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
All stability results are within specification limits and no specific trends are observed.  
Photostability results showed that the finished product is not photosensitive. 
The stability of the finished product in bulk shipment packs was assessed on three pilot batches of each 
strength at ICH accelerated i.e. 40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH and ICH long term i.e. 25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH 
stability conditions. The results support a 12 months holding time for the finished product in bulk shipment 
packs. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage precaution for 
all the presentations except the 800 mg strength in the PVC/PE/PVDC-Al blister that need to be stored below 
25°C and the proposed in-use shelf-life (100 days for the 75/150/300/400/600 mg tablets – 90 days for the 
800 mg tablet) as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (KD  of 4.5 x 
-12
10
M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus infected cells, 
thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. 
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Darunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory strains of 
HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human 
monocytes/macrophages with median EC50  values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/ml). Darunavir 
demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group 
O primary isolates with EC50  values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM. 
These EC50  values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 µM to > 100 µM. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with ritonavir, have been evaluated in healthy 
adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher in HIV-1 infected patients 
than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 infected patients compared to healthy 
Assessment report  
EMA/851324/2016 
Page 17/40 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
subjects  may  be  explained  by  the  higher  concentrations  of  α1-acid  glycoprotein  (AAG)  in  HIV-1  infected 
patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to plasma AAG and, therefore, higher plasma concentrations. 
Darunavir  is  primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A.  Ritonavir  inhibits  CYP3A,  thereby  increasing  the  plasma 
concentrations of darunavir considerably. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
In repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment with 
darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood coagulation 
system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related parameters was observed, 
together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time. 
Changes were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and thyroid 
(follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small increase in 
effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the pancreas (in male 
rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity findings or target 
organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the recommended dose. 
In a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the presence 
of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir treatment up to 
1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the clinically recommended 
dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in rats and rabbits when treated 
alone, nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The exposure levels were lower than those 
with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, 
darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient reduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-
weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening of eyes and ears.  Darunavir in combination with 
ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups that exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation 
and a reduced pup survival during lactation. These effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active 
substance via the milk and/or maternal toxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir 
alone or in combination with ritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased 
mortality was observed with convulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was 
considerably higher than in adult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After 
day 23 of life, the exposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least 
partly due to immaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related 
mortalities were noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at 
500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were 
comparable to those observed in adult rats. 
Due to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver enzymes, 
darunavir with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age. 
Darunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up to 104 
weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, 150 and 500 
mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and 
carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid follicular cell adenomas were noted 
in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a statistically significant increase in the incidence of 
any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in 
Assessment report  
EMA/851324/2016 
Page 18/40 
 
  
  
rodents are considered to be of limited relevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats 
caused hepatic microsomal enzyme induction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose 
rats, but not humans, to thyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on 
AUC) to darunavir were between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those 
observed in humans at the recommended therapeutic doses. 
After 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney changes were 
observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy). 
Darunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including bacterial 
reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo micronucleus test in 
mice. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Darunavir manufactured by Mylan is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined 
sales volumes for all darunavir containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
The impurity profile of the medicinal product being applied for has been adequately discussed.   
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Darunavir Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing darunavir. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with two-treatment, two-sequence, two-
period crossover design under fed conditions. These were the pivotal studies for the assessment. 
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as 
well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) are of particular 
relevance.

GCP 
• 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
Biowaiver justification for Darunavir 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets: 
The bio-equivalence study was performed on Darunavir 600 mg film-coated tablets and the applicant 
requests that this study be extended to the lower strengths via bio waiver.  
The applicant states that since all the requirements to waive bioequivalence studies for additional strengths 
as mentioned in CPMP guideline on the Investigation of Bio-equivalence – CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev 01 
– January 2010 are fulfilled, the bioequivalence study results of Darunavir 600 mg film-coated tablets can be 
extended to Darunavir 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets. 
Linear pharmacokinetics of Darunavir 
In adults, linear pharmacokinetics is observed after single dose administration over the 300 – 1200 mg 
darunavir dose range with 100 mg ritonavir. A biowaiver was considered acceptable, as for the 75 and 150 
mg tablet formulations dissolution studies comparing the tablets with the 300 and 600 mg tablets showed 
comparable results. 
Moreover, the tablets are dose-proportional, and darunavir with ritonavir shows linear pharmacokinetics after 
single dose administration (Assessment Report. EMEA. Prezista. 2009). 
Also WHO prequalification document states that due to the linear / dose-proportional pharmacokinetics of 
danuravir and its low solubility, the maximum strength in the application to PQ (i.e., 800 mg for the 400 mg, 
600 mg and 800 mg strengths) can be employed in the bioequivalence study (Darunavir. WHO Guidance, 
2014). 
Also when darunavir was administered in combination with ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, the plasma 
concentration of darunavir was increased (Ruela Corrêa JC et al., 2012). 
The requirements for the request of biowaiver for the following strengths:  75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 400 
mg film-coated tablets are considered fulfilled in line with the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev 01.  
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies (see below: section 
2.4.2).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study BA14101343-01 – Study Title: 
Single dose oral bioequivalence study of Darunavir film-coated Tablets 800 mg and ‘PREZISTA’ 
(Darunavir Ethanolate) film-coated Tablets 800 mg with co-administration of ‘NORVIR’ 
(Ritonavir) film-coated Tablets 100 mg in healthy adult human subjects under fed conditions 
Methods 
This  was  a  randomised,  open-label,  two-period,  two-treatment,  two-sequence,  balanced,  single  dose,  
crossover  comparative  oral  bioavailability  study  to  establish  comparative  bioequivalence  of    Darunavir  800 
mg  film  coated  tablets  (test  manufactured  by  Mylan  Laboratories  India)  and  Prezista  800  mg  film  coated 
tablets (MAH: Janssen-Cilag International NV, Belgium and manufactured by Janssen-Cilag SpA, Italy ) with 
co-administration of Norvir (ritonavir 100mg film coated tablets, MAH: AbbVie Ltd, UK and manufactured by 
Abbvie  Deutschland  GmbH)  in  44  healthy,  adult  human  subjects  under  fed  conditions.  The  objective  of  the 
study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events 
to ensure the safety of the subjects. 
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours in both periods each 
volunteer was served with a standardised breakfast on day 1, 2, 4 and 5 at about 30 minutes prior to dosing. 
A single oral dose of concomitant ritonavir medication was administered to the subjects twice daily at an 
interval of 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 5 and a single 800mg oral dose of investigational product (test or 
reference) was administered to the subjects on day 3. Administration of the morning concomitant medication 
and investigational product was done simultaneously on day 3 of each period.   
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture with 240ml of ambient temperature water. During confinement 
(Day 1 to 5), a standard meal was served at least 04 hours after dosing of IP/dosing of morning concomitant 
medication. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing on day 3 of each period (dosing of 
investigational product) and until one hour post dose. Further meals/snacks after 04 hours post dose of 
IP/dosing of morning concomitant medication were served at appropriate times. Meals/snacks/breakfasts of 
identical composition and similar quantities were provided at approximately same times in all the periods.  
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 8 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 
2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 
72.00 hours after dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are presented in the dossier.  
After collection, the blood samples were placed in an ice bath until centrifugation and then placed in a 
refrigerated centrifuge within 30 minutes of blood sample collection, and then spun at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 
15 minutes. The plasma was separated, transferred to labelled primary and secondary aliquots; primary 
aliquot was contained 1.5 ml of plasma and remaining amount was transferred in to secondary aliquot and 
stored in a freezer at – 70°C ±20°C at the clinical facility until shipment to analytical facility.

Test and Reference Products 
Darunavir Mylan 800 mg Film-coated Tablets manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Ltd. (batch No 364428D; 
Exp. date, June 2016) has been compared to PREZISTA Film Coated Tablets 800 mg manufactured by

Study BA14101915-01 Study Title: 
Single dose oral bioequivalence study of Darunavir film-coated Tablets 600 mg and ‘PREZISTA’ (Darunavir) 
Film tabletten (film-coated Tablets) 600 mg with co-administration of ‘NORVIR’ (Ritonavir) Film tabletten 
(film-coated Tablets) 100 mg in healthy adult human subjects under fed conditions. 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, balanced, single dose,  
crossover comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  Darunavir 600 
mg film coated tablets (test manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Maharashtra India) and Prezista 600 mg 
film coated tablets (MAH: Janssen-Cilag International NV, Belgium and manufactured by Janssen-Cilag SpA, 
Italy ) with co-administration of Norvir (ritonavir 100mg film coated tablets, MAH: AbbVie Ltd, UK and 
manufactured by Abbvie Deutschland GmbH) in 59 healthy, adult, male human subjects under fed conditions. 
The objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to monitor 
the adverse events to ensure the safety of the subjects. 
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours in both periods each 
volunteer was served with a standardised breakfast on day 1, 2, 4 and 5 at about 30 minutes prior to dosing. 
A single oral dose of concomitant ritonavir (100mg) medication was administered to the subjects twice daily 
at an interval of 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 5 and a single 800mg oral dose of investigational product (test 
or reference) was administered to the subjects on day 3. Administration of the morning concomitant 
medication and investigational product was done simultaneously on day 3 of each period.   
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture with 240ml of ambient temperature water. During confinement 
(Day 1 to 5), a standard meal was served at least 04 hours after dosing of IP/dosing of morning concomitant 
medication. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing on day 3 of each period (dosing of 
investigational product) and until one hour post dose. Further meals/snacks after 04 hours post dose of 
IP/dosing of morning concomitant medication were served at appropriate times. Meals/snacks/breakfasts of 
identical composition and similar quantities were provided at approximately same times in all the periods. 
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 8 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 
2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 
72.00 hours after dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are presented in the dossier.

Safety data 
During the course of study the safety parameters assessed were vital signs, physical examination, medical 
history, clinical laboratory safety tests (haematology, biochemistry, immunological tests, urinalysis), chest X-
ray (within past six months) and ECG at baseline. Laboratory parameters (haematology and biochemistry 
tests) were re-assessed at the end of last period of the study. In this study, all the out of range laboratory 
parameters were evaluated as clinically insignificant or clinically significant during post study assessment. 
The laboratory parameter which was labelled as clinically significant by the physician, was documented as an 
adverse event and repeated until it was reported clinically non significant or within the normal range in the 
follow up.  
Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no relevant differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the preparations. A total of seven adverse events (AEs) were reported by seven 
subjects and all the adverse events were considered to be mild in nature.  
There were two AEs (Dizziness and Headache) considered possibly related and one AE (Platelet count 
increased) considered remotely related to the oral administration of test product. There were three AEs 
(Headache, Eosinophil count increased and Blood triglycerides increased) considered possibly related and one 
AE (White blood cell count increased) considered remotely related to the oral administration of reference 
product. 
The volunteers that encountered the adverse events completely recovered before the end of the study. No 
statistical significant differences between the TEST and REFERENCE treatments, for the incidence of subjects 
having experienced AEs and for the incidence of AEs were seen.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to ‘parent ‘PIL A’ Duloxetine Mylan hard gastro-resistant capsules and 
‘parent’ PIL B Prezista 75mg film-coated tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been 
found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of darunavir film-coated tablets formulation. The reference 
product Prezista, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.  
Prezista, co-administered with cobicistat, is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies conducted with 800 mg and 600 mg film-coated tablet formulations, form the 
pivotal basis, with an open label, balanced, randomized single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-
period crossover design.  The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, 
overall sampling time, as well as “wash-out” period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Darunavir Mylan film-coated Tablet 600 mg met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the [reference product]. The point estimates and their 90% confidence 
intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of [range, 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Darunavir Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
75mg, 150mg, 300mg, 600mg tablets 
Darunavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. 
Darunavir Mylan tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2): 
● 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult 
patients, including those that have been highly pre-treated. 
● 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at 
least 15 kg body weight. 
In deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of 
mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and 
treatment history should guide the use of darunavir. 
400mg and 800mg tablets 
Darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.  
Darunavir co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients (see 
section 4.2).  
Darunavir Mylan tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 40 kg body weight who are:  
● 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2).  
● 
ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have 
plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In deciding to initiate 
treatment with darunavir in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic testing should guide the use of 
darunavir (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

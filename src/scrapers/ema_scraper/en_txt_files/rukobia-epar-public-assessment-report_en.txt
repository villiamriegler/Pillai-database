2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
While there is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS available, highly effective antiretroviral (ARV) therapy 
has greatly improved the lives of HIV infected individuals.  
Despite  the  availability  of  different  classes  of  ARV  agents  providing  a  variety  of  treatment  options, 
treatment  failure  continues  to  occur  as  a  result  of  ARV  drug  resistance,  drug-associated  toxicity  and 
tolerability  problems,  and  poor  adherence.  Treatment  failure  may  result  in  selection  of  virus  with 
resistance to one or more ARV agents. Patients infected with multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 have at 
least  one  major  resistance  mutation  within  each  of  the  standard  antiretroviral  therapy  drug  classes 
(nucleoside  or  nucleotide  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (NRTI)  or  non-NRTIs  (NNRTI),  protease 
inhibitors (PI) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI)), but often many resistance associated 
mutations are seen simultaneously. Upon virologic failure to their current antiretroviral regimen, these 
patients have limited or no remaining treatment options. Late-line regimens often lack the convenience 
and tolerability of first-line drugs, which in-turn, may exacerbate non-adherence. Thus, there is a need 
for new classes of ARV drugs, which are well tolerated and offer novel mechanisms of action with no 
cross-resistance to current ARVs, and which are capable of providing potent, durable antiviral activity 
against multi-drug resistant viruses. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  following  therapeutic  indication  has  been  applied  for:  Rukobia,  in  combination  with  other 
antiretrovirals, is indicated for the treatment of adults with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom 
it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive anti-viral regimen due to resistance, intolerance 
or safety considerations. 
The  sought  indication  pertains  to  patients  infected  with  MDR  HIV-1.  There  is  no  uniform  definition  of 
MDR HIV-1; it can be defined as those patients with HIV-1 who have phenotypic or genotypic resistance 
to either three or all of the standard antiretroviral therapy drug classes: nucleoside or nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase  inhibitors  (NRTI),  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (NNRTI),  protease 
inhibitors (PI), and/or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). MDR HIV-1 is usually established by 
at least one major resistance mutation within each drug class present in genotypic resistance testing, 
but in these patients often many resistance mutations are seen simultaneously. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS and 1.8 million people 
were newly infected with HIV (UNAIDS, 2018). Of the people living with HIV in 2017, 20.9 million were 
on ART (UNAIDS, 2018).  
Reliable figures for prevalence of multidrug resistant HIV-1 are not available. The applicant expanded on 
the  concept  of  “Heavily  Treatment  Experienced  (HTE)  patients”  instead.  This  group  is  considered  to 
represent  a  small,  often  marginalised,  subsegment  of  the  overall  HIV  community  and  is  among  the 
patient groups with the greatest unmet medical need. There is no standardised definition characterising 
the HTE population. Rates for the HTE population vary by region and country; estimated prevalence is 
approximately <1% to 5.1% (Bajema, 2019; Hsu, 2018).  
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 10/85 
 
  
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
HIV-1 and HIV-2 are two distinct viruses. Since fostemsavir (active temsavir) is not active against HIV-
2, the following focuses on subtypes of HIV-1.  
HIV-1 accounts for around 95% of all infections worldwide. The strains of HIV-1 can be classified into 
four groups of which M is responsible for the majority of the global HIV epidemic. The other three groups 
-  N,  O  and  P  -  are  quite  uncommon.  Group  O  represents  up  to  5%  of  infections  in  several  west  and 
central African countries, and Group N and P have been rarely identified in Cameroon. All groups can be 
detected by HIV-1 antibody tests. 
Within group  M  there  are known  to  be  at  least nine  genetically  distinct  subtypes  of  HIV-1.  These  are 
subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K. Additionally, different subtypes can combine genetic material to 
form a hybrid virus and around 89 of these are known to exist.   
The dominant HIV subtype in the EU and North America is subtype B. As a result, the great majority of 
HIV  clinical  research  has  been  conducted  in  populations  where  subtype  B  predominates,  despite  this 
subtype representing only 12% of global HIV infections. Nearly 50% of all people living with HIV have 
subtype C. It is very common in the high prevalence countries of Southern Africa, as well as in the horn 
of Africa and India. The greatest diversity of subtypes is found in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. 
Some  studies  suggest  that  certain  subtypes  have  a  greater  risk  of  transmission  or  faster  disease 
progression than others – but more recent research suggests that this may not be the case. On the other 
hand,  although  largely  tested  in  people  with  subtype  B,  ARVs  have  generally  proven  to  be  effective 
against  a  wide  range  of  subtypes,  although  there  is  conflicting  evidence  about  the  effectiveness  of 
protease inhibitors against subtype C virus. 
Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  (HIV)  is  rapidly  replicating  and  has  a  high  mutation  rate.  HIV-1 
replication occurs at a high rate and this, in combination with the absence of proofreading capacity of 
the viral reverse transcriptase, results in an estimated mutation rate of approximately one nucleotide 
mutation per replicative cycle. Hence, many HIV variants are simultaneously present in each infected 
individual, which is also described as “quasispecies”. Upon antiviral drug pressure, the circulating HIV-1 
variants most fit under this selection pressure will be able to replicate, resulting in selection of a viral 
population with reduced susceptibility to this treatment. Often, resistance to drugs in a certain ARV class 
results in cross-resistance to other drugs in that same class. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Acute  HIV-1  infection  is  often  missed,  as  it  usually  presents  with  nonspecific  signs  and  symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea) or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, these 
generally  emerge  approximately  2  weeks  following  HIV  infection.  Among  those  presenting  with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Diagnosis therefore most often occurs during chronic infection. In some settings, up to half of people 
present  to  care  with  advanced  HIV  disease  –  defined  by  WHO  as  having  a  CD4+  cell  count  <200 
cells/mm3  or  a  WHO  clinical  stage  3  or  4  disease.  Leading  causes  of  mortality  among  adults  with 
advanced  HIV  disease  globally  include  tuberculosis  (TB),  severe  bacterial  infections,  cryptococcal 
meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies. Initial laboratory testing should include assessment of HIV staging parameters (CD4+ cell 
count, HIV RNA plasma concentrations) as well as a HIV genotype test for detection of drug resistance. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 11/85 
 
  
 
 
The spectrum of drug resistance in an individual patient can range from minimal resistance that affects 
the activity of one or two drugs, to multidrug resistance that includes resistance to several drug classes. 
However,  the  risk  of  developing  MDR  virus  has  been  much  lower  in  recent  years  than  before  due  to 
regimens that are easy to take, e.g. as single tablet regimens, well tolerated and are less likely to induce 
drug resistance mutations. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current  treatment  guidelines  recommend  a  combination  of  2  nucleoside/tide  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitor  (NRTIs)  plus  an  integrase  strand  transfer  inhibitor  (INSTI),  a  non-nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) or the combination of 1 NRTI + INSTI for first 
line  therapy  in  ART  naive  infected  individuals.  An  unboosted  INSTI  with  a  high  genetic  barrier  (e.g. 
dolutegravir)  is  the  preferred  agent  (EACS  2019)  as  constituent  of  NRTI-containing  first  line  ART  in 
treatment naïve patients. This treatment effectively suppresses HIV-1 viral load to undetectable levels 
in most patients. However, viral resistance to any regimen can develop, due to e.g. poor adherence or 
insufficient drug exposure due to drug interactions. 
The  main  goal  in  any  HIV-1  infected  patient  is  full  virologic  suppression,  i.e.  having  HIV-1  RNA  load 
below the limit of detection of most commonly used assays. If virologic suppression cannot be achieved, 
the  next  best  is  preserving  immunologic  function,  preventing  clinical  progression,  and  minimising  the 
increasing resistance to drug classes that could potentially include newly developed drugs. 
Patients  with  MDR  HIV-1  have  very  few  treatment  options.  When  viral  replication  is  not  effectively 
suppressed, patients are at increased risk for disease progression, AIDS, and ultimately death. Treatment 
regimens in these patients typically include drugs at higher than standard dosages and drugs from less 
frequently used classes such as fusion inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists or the recently approved entry 
inhibitor ibalizumab. As per recognised HIV-1 treatment guidelines in case of MDR HIV-1, at least two 
and preferably three new active drugs are used for constructing a therapeutic regimen. Investigational 
agents need to be considered in patients for whom it is not possible to construct a suppressive regimen 
using approved treatment options. 
About the product 
Fostemsavir (FTR) is a methyl-phosphate prodrug of the active moiety temsavir (TMR), which has been 
developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infected HTE patients with multi-drug resistance.  
The  prodrug  FTR  is  converted  to  TMR  through  the  action  of  alkaline  phosphatase  within  the 
gastrointestinal lumen. TMR, the active moiety of FTR specifically binds to gp120 near the CD4-receptor 
binding  site  and  blocks  attachment  of  the  virus  to  the  CD4  receptor  on  CD4+  containing  cells.  The 
mechanism of action of TMR is understood to be the result of binding near the CD4 binding pocket within 
the gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. The TMR-bound gp120 is then believed to be held 
in  the  "closed”  conformation,  which  precludes  initial  interaction  between  the  virus  and  cellular  CD4 
receptors. In consequence, this prevents viral attachment to cellular CD4 receptors and any further steps 
required for entry of virus into the host cells. 
The recommended oral dose of fostemsavir is 600 mg with or without food twice daily. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on a novel mechanism of action which 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 12/85 
 
  
 
 
 
was considered to address a major challenge in patients who cannot construct a suppressive regimen 
because of therapeutic limitations resulting from multi-drug resistance. Furthermore, results from the 
fostemsavir development programme suggested that fostemsavir has no in-vitro cross-resistance to 
other ARVs, has few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, and can be used, without dose-
adjustment, across a broad spectrum of patient populations including individuals with mild-to-severe 
renal and/or hepatic impairment. The CHMP also considered as relevant the difference between an 
authorised product Trogarzo (ibalizumab) and fostemsavir in terms of the method of administration, 
i.e. 14-daily infusions (with the need for regular visits to the health care facility) for ibalizumab as 
compared to twice daily oral intake for fostemsavir.  
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as the applicant was unable to address the D90 List of Questions within a 
timeframe mandated by the accelerated assessment review rules.

The product is available in white high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene child 
resistant closures that include a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liner as described in section 6.5 
of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fostemsavir tromethamine is (3-((4-benzoyl-1-piperazinyl)(oxo)acetyl)-4-
methoxy-7-(3-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)methyl dihydrogen 
phosphate, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1) corresponding to the molecular formula 
C25H26N7O8P.C4H11NO3. It has a relative molecular mass of 704.62 g/mol (salt form) and the following 
structure: 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 13/85 
 
  
 
 
 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Full information on the active substance has been provided in the dossier. The chemical structure of 
fostemsavir tromethamine was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated by a combination of 
mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy 
(IR), elemental analysis, Raman spectroscopy and single crystal x-ray diffraction spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to almost white crystalline powder which is freely soluble in aqueous 
media at pH 3.7 and above but less soluble at pH 1.7 where it is converted to the free acid. Extensive 
polymorph screening revealed several solvates/hydrates. The chosen commercial polymorphic form is 
the most thermodynamically stable form and is routinely produced by the commercial manufacturing 
process. 
Fostemsavir tromethamine possesses no chiral centres or olefinic double bonds and therefore has no 
potential for optical or geometrical isomerism. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Fostemsavir tromethamine is synthesised in four main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. One of the starting materials was originally classified as a reagent by the 
applicant. CHMP raised a major objection (MO) requesting redefinition of the reagent as an 
intermediate and addition of upstream steps to the process description. In response, the applicant 
argued that materials upstream of the reagent were not suitable starting materials and CHMP accepted 
redefinition of the reagent as a starting material with tighter impurity limits in its specification.  
The applicant also submitted a post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) covering changes 
to any of the approved manufacturers of the starting materials to be submitted as a type IA variation. 
The protocol considers the impact of associated changes to the route of synthesis of any of the starting 
materials. A summary of a risk assessment to support changes which covers the potential impact of 
change, risks to product quality and risk mitigation plans. Acceptance criteria and data to be provided 
in the regulatory submission (Type IA) are sufficiently described. If the change fails to meet the 
acceptance criteria, then this falls outside the scope of this protocol and would be subject to standard 
post-approval change procedures. Overall, the PACMP was deemed acceptable. 
The applicant originally proposed a limited set of established conditions (ECs) to describe the 
manufacturing process and its control strategy, along with proposed post-approval reporting 
categories. However, these were not deemed to be extensive enough or in line with the EU 
requirements. Rather than amend the ECs and associated reporting categories, the applicant chose to 
remove them from the dossier. 
The applicant followed a quality by design approach to development including the use of multivariate 
experiments to investigate parameter limits. These studies were used only for development purposes 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 14/85 
 
  
 
 
 
and no design spaces are claimed. The control strategy for the active substance consists of control of 
raw materials, control of relevant process parameters including the definition of proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) for certain parameters where justified, as well as testing of intermediates and in-
process materials. Critical steps were defined, along with critical process parameters. Adequate in-
process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are acceptable. The 
control and purge of impurities has been extensively studied and ensures the quality of the active 
substance. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development  programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags stored within aluminium foil laminate bags further 
stored within a rigid opaque container. The materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (Raman), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC/LCMS), residual solvents (GC/HPLC), water content (KF) and residue on ignition (Ph. 
Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  
The provided justification for the parameters included in the specification and those parameters not 
included in the specification is acceptable 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of the active substance from the proposed 
commercial supplier were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. In addition, batch data were provided from an additional 72 batches of active substance 
manufactured throughout development on a range of scales and used in non-clinical and clinical 
studies and also showed batch to batch consistency. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from a previous manufacturer 
and one from the proposed commercial manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 
up to 48 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Minor changes 
have been made to the manufacturing process since set-down of these batches on stability but the 
changes are not expected to result in an altered stability profile. In addition, data was provided from 3 
production scale batches from the intended commercial supplier which show a similar profile after 6 
months. The stability studies will continue post-approval up to the agreed shelf-life. The following 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 15/85 
 
  
 
 
parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities and water content. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes to the measured 
parameters were observed throughout the studies. In addition, it was shown that the polymorphic form 
of the active substance is stable throughout shelf-life. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Results under stressed conditions were also provided. Storage under ambient humidity conditions at 
either -20, 5 or 50°C in the LDPE bag showed no changes to impurities or appearance. The active 
substance was also exposed to more extreme conditions (80°C, high humidity) as well as acid, base or 
an oxidant in the solution phase. Some degradation was observed in the solid phase and extensive 
degradation was observed in solution under all conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at up to 30°C in 
the proposed container in order to protect from moisture and light - do not refrigerate. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a film-coated, prolonged-release tablet for oral administration containing 725 mg 
of fostemsavir tromethamine, which is equivalent to 600 mg of fostemsavir free acid. The tablets are 
beige, biconvex, oval shaped, approximately 19 mm in length, 10 mm in width, and 8 mm in thickness, 
film-coated tablets debossed with SV 1V7 on one side and plain on the other side. 
The applicant followed a QbD approach to development including defining a quality target product 
profile (QTPP) for the product and the routine use of risk assessment. 
Hypromellose type 2208 was selected as the polymeric excipient to impart extended release properties 
due to its hydrophilicity and gel-forming properties which slow the release of drug via a predominately 
diffusional process. Hydroxypropyl cellulose is used to complement the controlled release matrix 
formed by Hypromellose. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, other than the coating agent whose components meet relevant 
quality standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
For various commercial reasons, three separate manufacturers produced material for the phase 3 
clinical trials. The transfer of manufacture from site to site was accompanied by small modifications to 
the process and to the relative excipient content to accommodate different manufacturing equipment. 
Comparison of in vitro dissolution profiles at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 demonstrated that finished product 
manufactured at these sites can be considered bioequivalent. 
The dissolution method was developed to enable monitoring of drug release over a 24 hour period. 
Overall, the selected release method is considered to be sufficiently discriminatory. 
The manufacturing process was developed following the principles of ICH Q8, 9 and 10 using extensive 
risk assessment including failure mode effects analysis (FMEA) to identify potential CQAs and critical 
process parameters (CPPs). Extensive experimentation was undertaken for each unit operation to 
investigate different parameters and ensure a robust process. The applicant originally proposed a set 
of ECs based on the CPPs with associated variation classes for post-approval changes. These were for 
the most part in line with current EU requirements but some proposals were not accepted. The 
applicant chose to remove rather than amend the proposed ECs.  
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 16/85 
 
  
 
 
The primary packaging is a white HDPE bottle with polypropylene child resistant closure that 
includes a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liner. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  pre-granulation  blending,  granulation,  pre-
compression blending, compression, film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-
standard manufacturing process because the product has an extended release profile. 
A major objection was raised by CHMP as no process validation data was submitted with the initial 
submission. In response, the applicant provided validation data on 3 consecutive production scale 
batches of finished product covering the major steps of the process. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The control strategy includes controls on attributes of the active substance and 
other input materials, parameters of the manufacturing process including facility and equipment 
operating conditions, attributes of in-process materials and in-process controls (IPCs) and finished 
product specifications and the associated methods. The IPCs are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
description, identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The release and shelf life specifications contain all relevant parameters for the proposed dosage form. 
Release and shelf-life specification for dissolution has been set based on the dissolution data of clinical 
batches and consists of measurements at three time-points, which is in compliance with QWP guideline 
CPMP/QWP/604/96. The limits for the two degradation products are deemed acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
performed as requested by CHMP considering all potential root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of contamination with nitrosamine impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Furthermore, 
a detailed overview of all batches used in Phase 1 and 2 in support of clinical studies and details including 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 17/85 
 
  
 
 
test  results  for  the  batches  (~30  batches)  used  in  Phase  3  studies  are  presented  in  section  P.5.4  to 
support specification settings.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
various conditions (5ºC and 25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months at 30ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of finished product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging representative of that proposed for marketing. The batches were all made by a 
previous  manufacturer  and  have  different  de-bossing.  Their  manufacturing  process  is  also  slightly 
different. These changes are not expected to significantly impact the behaviour of the finished product 
on  storage.  Nonetheless,  a  new  stability  study  has  begun  with  three  batches  manufactured  at  the 
commercial  site,  using  the  commercial  equipment  train  and  process  and  packed  in  the  intended 
commercial primary package. Up to 6 months’ data is available under all above-mentioned conditions, 
with no significant changes to any of the measured parameters. 
The shelf-life tests are the same as those used for release and are stability indicating. The totality of the 
data presented confirms that there is no negative impact on the stability behaviour of finished product 
manufactured by the revised process and stored in the revised packaging. 
In  addition,  one  production  scale  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Further stability data are available for one batch stored in HDPE bottles exposed to the stressed 
conditions of 50 ºC / ambient humidity for up to 3 months and exposed to a freeze/thaw cycle (-20 ºC 
/ 30 ºC) for up to 28 days. All results complied with specification under both sets of conditions. 
Bulk stability data is presented for two batches in LDPE bags with an activated carbon sachet and silica 
gel desiccant inside a fibre container stored at either 30 ºC / 65% RH or 30 ºC / ambient humidity. No 
significant changes were observed in description, fostemsavir content and dissolution at all conditions 
for both initial and aged in-use testing. The bulk pack used for the storage of the batch is 
representative of that proposed for the commercial product and the data generated support the 
proposed 18 month bulk hold time. 
An in-use stability study was conducted on two batches of finished product – one newly manufactured 
and the other towards the end of its shelf-life. The results indicate sufficient in-use stability for the 
intended dosing period. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and without specific storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of 
vegetable origin.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The 3 major objections 
on the definition of a starting material, missing process validation data and missing nitrosamines risk 
evaluation were all resolved during the procedure. The finished product manufacturing process controls 
degradation products thus ensuring the quality of the medicinal product. All originally proposed ECs 
have been removed from the dossier. There is one PACMP which documents the process to be followed 
for introduction of new active substance starting material manufacturers and is deemed acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A range of in vitro virology studies have been conducted to determine the mechanism of action, 
antiviral activity, and the potential for development of drug-resistance via mutations. 
The results are discussed in the clinical sections of this Assessment Report. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro enzyme/radioligand binding assays of FTR, TMR and BMS-646915 did not reveal any clinically 
relevant off-target activity. The concentration of 10  µM was considered appropriate, as it is about 23 
times the free clinical Cmax of 0.2 µg/ml or 0.42 µM (based on Cmax of 1.6 µg/mL TMR and plasma protein 
binding of 88.4%).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects on the cardiovascular system: A range of in-vitro studies have been conducted to investigate the 
potential cardiovascular toxicity of FTR, TMR and TMR metabolite (BMS-646915). 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 19/85 
 
  
 
 
The prodrug FTR showed no noteworthy effects in the in vitro-studies. Effects on the hERG channel, the 
sodium  and  calcium  channel,  isolated  Purkinje  fiber  and  aortic  ring  up  to  30  µM  were  investigated. 
However, these in-vitro studies are of little relevance, as FTR was detectable in human plasma only at 
very low concentrations (0.8 to 6.1%).  
Regarding the active substance TMR effects on the hERG channel and isolated Purkinje fiber up to 30 µM 
were investigated. TMR inhibited HERG currents by an IC50 of 27 µM, which corresponds to approximately 
64-fold the human free Cmax of 0.2 µg/mL or 0.42 µM (based on Cmax of 1.6 µg/mL and plasma protein 
binding of 88.4%) following a 1200 mg (600 mg BID) dose in humans. In the rabbit Purkinje fiber assay 
TMR prolonged APD50 and APD90 by 12 % and 11 % (n=3) at 30 µM, respectively. TMR had little effect 
on other action potential parameters measured. 
Regarding the main metabolite BMS-646915 effects on the hERG channel and isolated Purkinje fiber up 
to  30  µM  were  investigated.  BMS-646915  had  weak  effects  on  hERG  currents  by  inhibiting  hERG 
potassium  currents  by  4.9 %  and  11.3 %  at  10  and  30  µM,  respectively.  An  IC50  value  could  not  be 
determined. In the rabbit Purkinje fiber assay BMS-646915 produced a small prolongation of APD50 (10.5 
%),  but  had  no  effect  on  APD90  or  other  action  potential  parameters  measured  at  the  maximal  test 
concentration of 30 µM. The weak effects on the hERG channel and rabbit Purkinje fiber action potential 
indicated that BMS-646915 was unlikely to have clinically relevant effects on cardiac electrophysiology. 
In  a  single  oral-dose  cardiovascular  telemetry  study  in  dogs  FTR  induced  emesis,  mild  to  moderate 
increases in heart rate at 150 mg/kg/day (~22 to 40 µg/mL TMR), and prolongation of QT interval at 40 
and 150 mg/kg/day (≥ 10 µg/mL TMR). There were no drug-related changes in cardiovascular endpoints 
at 6 mg/kg/day FTR (~2 µg/mL TMR). 
In sum there were moderate or weak effects of TMR on the hERG channel and on rabbit Purkinje fiber 
action potential, respectively. In a single oral-dose cardiovascular telemetry study in dogs a prolongation 
of QT interval at 40 and 150 mg/kg/day (≥ 10 µg/mL TMR corresponds to > 6-fold the human Cmax) was 
seen.  
In a thorough QT study (206275) in healthy volunteers, a supratherapeutic dose of FTR (2.400 mg BID, 
which  is  4  times  the  recommended  dose),  for  7  days  was  associated  with  a  clinically  meaningful 
prolongation of the QTc interval as the maximum mean time-matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence 
bound) for the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in QTcF interval was 11.2 (13.3) milliseconds.  
Effects on the central nervous system: Based on ICH M3(R2) guidance, no independent central nervous 
system (CNS) safety pharmacology studies were conducted for FTR. Instead, CNS safety pharmacology 
endpoints were evaluated as part of the single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies following FTR dosing. 
In studies on pharmacokinetics very low brain penetrance was observed in pigmented Long-Evans and 
albino Sprague-Dawley rats receiving radioactive FTR, suggesting a low potential for CNS effects. In a 
single-dose mouse study, FTR-related CNS effects were limited to ataxia that was noted only at overtly 
toxic doses of ≥1000 mg/kg. There was no evidence of adverse effects on the nervous system (central 
or peripheral) in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats (2 and 4 weeks) and dogs (up to 9 month), with 
the exception of neurological clinical observations (ataxia; circling; tremors; abnormal gait, posture or 
pawing; cage biting; lameness; and head pressing against cage) in dogs at doses that were generally 
not tolerated (≥100 mg/kg/day; gender averaged Cmax ≥60.1 μg/mL, ≥37x RHD Cmax) in the 4-week 
oral exploratory toxicity study. In conclusion, CNS effects are not expected in humans treated with FTR 
as the CNS related findings only occurred at doses that were not tolerated in mice and dogs at exposures 
well above those at the RHD. 
Effects on the respiratory system: Based on ICH M3(R2) guidance, no independent respiratory safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted for FTR. Instead, respiratory safety pharmacology endpoints were 
evaluated  as  part of  the toxicology  studies  following  FTR  dosing.  In  a  single-dose  mouse  study,  FTR-
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 20/85 
 
  
 
 
related respiratory effects were limited to decreased and/or labored respiration, which were noted only 
at overtly toxic doses of ≥1000 mg/kg, while no respiratory effects occurred in mice at 500 mg/kg. There 
was  no  evidence  of  any  FTR-related effects  on  the respiratory  system  including  functional  respiratory 
changes or histologic findings in the lung in the pivotal studies in rats (up to 1 month) and dogs (up to 
9 month). Observations of labored and/or increased respiration at doses that were generally not tolerated 
(≥150 mg/kg/day; Cmax ≥83.5 µg /mL, ≥52x RHD Cmax) in the 2-week and 4-week oral toxicity study in 
dogs were considered to be secondary to poor clinical condition. In conclusion, respiratory effects are 
not expected in humans treated with FTR as the only respiratory findings occurred at doses that were 
not tolerated in mice and dogs at exposures well above those at the RHD. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
A range of pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies has been conducted to investigate the virology 
of FTR and TMR in combinations with other therapies. In vitro, TMR generally exhibited additive to 
synergistic activity in combination with other ARV drugs across all current ARV classes, including the 
recently approved ibalizumab. There was no antagonism observed with any TMR combination. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions are further discussed in the clinical sections of this Assessment 
Report. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The applicant has developed LC/MS-MS analytic methods to determine the concentration of FTR, TMR, 
BMS-646915 and BMS-930644 in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. The methods are of sufficient sensitivity 
and  specificity  to  support  the  performed  toxicokinetic  analysis  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  of 
between 4 and 10 ng/mL. The methods were sufficiently validated and are considered adequate. 
Absorption 
FTR is rapidly converted to TMR by the action of alkaline phosphatase, one of the enzymes located in the 
brush border of the cells in the lumen of the small intestine. The rationale for using FTR as the prodrug 
for  administration  is  based  on  the  limited  solubility  of  TMR  and  the  rapid  hydrolyses  of  FTR  in  the 
intestinal  lumen  and  subsequent  absorption  of  TMR.  There  is  very  little  absorption  of  FTR  in  the 
nonclinical species and systemic exposure measured were negligible. Bioavailability of TMR following oral 
administration of FTR was around 80% in rats and 104% in dogs. This is in contrast to humans in which 
the bioavailability was significantly lower at ~27%.  
Following repeated administration exposure increases were less than dose proportional in rats but were 
dose proportional in dogs. There were differences in exposure between sexes in either species nor any 
accumulation  following  repeated  administration.  A  study  in  dogs  suggested  that  twice  daily  dosing 
resulted in similar exposure levels relative to a single dose supporting the proposed BID dosing schedule. 
Distribution 
The in vitro protein binding studies revealed that the fraction of TMR which was bound higher in rat sera 
than in human sera (95% versus 84%). These studies were conducted at a single concentration of 10 
µM, however, subsequent studies with human donor sera with varying concentration of TMR in the range 
of 300-10,000 ng/ml revealed that the levels of protein binding were not concentration dependent. The 
blood to plasma partitioning of TMR was measured in several of the nonclinical species including rats, 
rabbits and dogs as well as in human blood with the measured values less than 1 in all instances except 
for dogs which ranged from 0.913 to 1.03. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 21/85 
 
  
 
 
A single dose in vivo study with [14C]-FTR was performed in both pigmented and albino rats using QWBA. 
Distribution occurred in the pigmented rats to the small intestine, liver, eye uveal tract, renal cortex, 
blood, adrenal gland, renal medulla, and lung with the Tmax for most tissues seen with 0.5 h after oral 
administration.  Very  limited  distribution  was  seen  in  the  CNS.  In  the  albino  rats  the  same  sites  of 
distribution  were  seen  with  the  exception  of  the  eye  uveal  tract,  adrenal  and  pituitary  glands.  These 
findings  suggest  a  potential  association  with  melanin  containing  tissues  of  the  eye  uveal  tract. 
Distribution  studies  performed  in  pregnant  rats  revealed  significant  transfer  across  the  placenta  with 
foetal exposure to all tissues examined including the brain. In addition, TMR was excreted into the milk 
with levels measured comparable to that of the plasma levels. 
Metabolism 
The major metabolites seen in humans are BMS-646915, formed by hydrolysis, and BMS-930644, formed 
by N-dealkylation. No formation of the BMS-646915 metabolite was seen in the presence of recombinant 
CYP enzymes suggesting this metabolite forms independent of CYP enzymes, likely involving the action 
of an esterase. Formation of BMS-930644 was CYP3A4 sensitive. In rats and dogs, the formation of BMS-
646915  was  a  minor  pathway,  however,  the  levels  of  BMS-646915  detected  in  the  toxicity  studies 
exceeded the levels at the clinical dose of 600 mg BID in humans. Of importance in vitro studies did not 
suggest the formation of any human only metabolites following TMR incubation with hepatocytes. 
Excretion 
Mass  balance  studies  were  performed  with  orally  administered  14C  radiolabelled  FTR.  Recovery  of 
radiolabel was greater than 90% in both rats and dogs. In both non-clinical species used for the toxicity 
studies, rats and dogs, the predominant route of excretion after metabolism was via biliary and faecal 
excretion at ~83% of the dose in rats and ~64% in dogs. Excretion into the urine was only ~12% in 
rats and ~22% in dogs. This is in contrast to the clinical situation where urinary excretion accounted for 
44% of the dose and faecal for 33% of the dose in a mass balance study. 
Enzyme inhibition and induction 
TMR,  BMS-930644  and  BMS-  646915  were  tested  for  inhibition  of  the  major  human  CYP  enzymes  in 
human liver microsomes (HLM) and in individual human recombinant cytochrome P450 (rCYP) enzymes 
heterologously expressed in insect cells. These results show that TMR and BMS-646915 are not inhibitors 
of the P450 enzymes tested with the IC50’s calculated to be greater than 40 µM for all the investigated 
CYP  enzymes.  Of  note the  applicant has  calculated IC50’s and  not  Ki  values  as per  the  applicable  EMA 
guideline  (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.  1  Corr.  2**).  For  BMS-930644  for  CYP2C8  and  CYP3A4  the  IC50 
values ranged from 36.2 to 32.9 µM and 15.2 to 9.9 µM, respectively, with and without preincubation. 
TMR (at concentrations of 2, 5, 20, and 100 µM)  was tested for enzyme induction. The applicant has 
indicated that, in line with the relevant EMA guideline (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) and the in 
vitro  CYP  induction  data,  TMR  is  a  potential  enzyme  inducer.  Furthermore,  an  in  vivo  DDI  study  has 
shown a low potential for significant CYP3A4 induction. An in vitro hepatocyte induction study confirmed 
dose-dependent increases for mRNA up to 26% of positive control for 1A2 at 100 μM, indicating TMR has 
the potential to be an in vitro CYP1A2 inducer. However, at the clinically relevant concentration of 5 μM, 
TMR  caused  only  an  ~5%  CYP1A2  mRNA  increase  compared  with  the  positive  control.  Therefore,  the 
data  suggested  that  TMR  is  a  very  weak  in  vitro  inducer  for  CYP1A2  and  unlikely  to  have  a  clinically 
relevant impact.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
FTR  has  low  acute  oral  toxicity  in  mice  and  rats.  In  mice,  a  single  oral  dose  of  500  mg/kg  was  well 
tolerated, while lethality was observed at doses ≥1000 mg/kg. Single oral doses of ≤2000 mg/kg in rats 
produced no mortality. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the rat repeated doses of FTR for 2 weeks resulted in transient decreases in body weight and/or food 
consumption as well as testicular toxicity characterised by the presence of enlarged spermatogenic cells 
in the testes and epididymides at 1000 mg/kg/day (191 x human AUC). FTR was not associated with 
any adverse toxic effects at daily doses up to 300 mg/kg (110 x human AUC) in this study. 
In the 4-week study in rats FTR was clinically tolerated at doses of ≤1000 mg/kg/day. Target organs of 
toxicity at doses ≥300 mg/kg/day consisted of the kidney and male and female reproductive organs. 
With only minimal changes that lacked clinical or histologic correlates. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) for this study was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 77 x human 
AUC). 
FTR was clinically tolerated by rats for 26 weeks at oral doses of ≤300 mg/kg/day. The primary target 
organs were the kidney (tubular dilatation) at ≥30 mg/kg/day and the adrenal glands (angiectasis) and 
testes (degeneration) at ≥100 mg/kg/day. All FTR-related changes were partially to fully reversible after 
an  8-week  recovery  period.  The  low  dose  of  30  mg/kg/day  is  considered  the  NOAEL  based  on  the 
generally minimal severity and complete reversibility of the serum electrolyte changes and renal tubular 
dilatation at this dose (30 mg/kg/day corresponds to 38 x human AUC). 
In sum, in the rat target organs of toxic effects were the kidney (tubular dilatation) at ≥30 mg/kg/day), 
the  adrenal  glands  (angiectasis)  and  testes  (degeneration)  at  ≥100  mg/kg/day.  The  NOAEL  of  30 
mg/kg/day in the 26-week study corresponds to 38 x the human AUC. 
In the dog repeated doses of FTR for 2 weeks resulted in mortality and severe toxicity characterised by 
necrosis and inflammation in the adrenal gland; lymphoid depletion in the thymus, spleen, and lymph 
nodes;  and  inflammatory  lesions  of  the  joints,  heart,  and  meninges.  At  100  mg/kg/day  transient 
decreases in activity, emesis, and pressure-induced joint pain were noted, but there were no microscopic 
correlates. A daily dose of 30 mg/kg was associated with transient decreases in activity only and was 
considered to be the NOAEL (30 mg/kg/day corresponds to 7.7 x human AUC). 
In the 4-week study in dogs FTR was generally tolerated at daily oral doses of 50 mg/kg,  which was 
associated with minor fecal changes and vomitus. At doses ≥100 mg/kg/day, neurologic signs of toxicity, 
body-weight loss, increases in bilirubin, and cortical hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis of the adrenal 
gland were prominent effects. FTR was not tolerated at 200 mg/kg/day resulting in euthanisation of 1 
dog on Day 15 and early termination of this dose level on Days 19 and 20. 
The NOAEL for this study was determined to be 50 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 10 
x human AUC. FTR was well tolerated by dogs for 39 weeks at oral doses of ≤60 mg/kg/day. The primary 
target organ was the liver. Based on the minimal effects at 30 mg/kg/day and the increase in bilirubin 
at 60 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (corresponds to 3 x human AUC). 
In repeated-dose toxicity studies, the target organs of toxicity were testes, kidneys, and adrenal gland 
in rats and liver in dogs. 
Testicular  findings  (degeneration  of  seminiferous  epithelium,  decreases  in  sperm  motility  and  sperm 
morphologic alterations) occurred only at high systemic exposure in rats, were partially reversible, were 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 23/85 
 
  
 
 
not  associated  with  effects  on  fertility  and  were  not  observed  in  dogs.  Hence,  the  potential  risk  for 
testicular changes in humans is low. 
Renal findings (decreases in urine pH, renal tubular dilatation, increase kidney weight and urine volume) 
are considered to be of low concern in humans as they occurred at high systemic exposure multiples in 
the rats and were not observed in dogs. 
Adrenal gland findings (angiectasis, increased gland size and weight) are considered to be of minor safety 
concern in humans as they occurred at high systemic exposures in animals. 
Liver toxicity (hepatic canalicular bile pigment deposits and lipofuscin pigment deposits in Kupffer cells) 
was considered to be of little safety concern in humans as they were not associated with degenerative 
changes in the liver, not observed in rats at high exposure multiples, and no FTR related liver findings 
were observed in the clinical trials at doses ≤1600 mg per day. Close monitoring of liver chemistries is 
recommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection taking FTR. 
Genotoxicity 
The prodrug FTR and its active form TMR were tested in an ICHS2(R1) compliant test battery consisting 
of  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay,  chromosome  mutations  in  mammalian  cells  and  in  vivo  in  a 
micronucleus  assay.  Sufficient  exposure  to  TMR  was  confirmed  by  TK  evaluation  in  the  micronucleus 
test. There was no evidence for a genotoxic potential for FTR or TMR. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of orally administered FTR was assessed in a 2-year study in rats as well as 
in a 6-month study in CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 hemizygous mice. In the rat study there was no evidence of 
an  increased  risk  of  carcinogenesis  with  the  oral  use  of  FTR  at  doses  of  10,  30  and  100  mg/kg/day. 
However, increased mortalities for males were noted in a dose-responsive fashion which necessitated 
the dose level for males to be lowered to 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day from Week 58 (Day 400) onwards. 
The top dosed male group (100/20 mg/kg/day) had to be terminated in Week 69 (Day 481) and the 
30/10 mg/kg/day group terminated in Week 87 (Day 605). All females were terminated starting in Week 
100 (Day 699). The cause of the decreased survival in the males is unclear and in many instances was 
not determined. It is accepted that the doses in the mid- and high-dose groups exceeded the maximum 
tolerated dose over time in males. The toxicokinetics suggested that sufficient exposures were achieved 
and even following the dose reduction in the mid- and high-dose groups the margins of exposure in the 
male animals were in excess of 10-fold the clinical exposure levels at the RHD. It is noted that neither 
of the metabolites, BMS-646915 and BMS-930644, have been measured as part of the TK. 
In the transgenic mouse study, the doses used for males were lower than that of females based on the 
results of a 4-week dose range finding study which identified a NOAEL of 300 mg/kg/day in males and 
600 mg/kg/day in females. This rasH2 mice model was considered an acceptable model for studying the 
carcinogenic  potential  of  FTR  and  the  positive  control  used  functioned  as  expected  with  increased 
mortality associated with commonly observed tumours associated with the use of N-nitrosomethylurea 
in this model. There was no FTR related increases in tumour incidences or neoplastic or non-neoplastic 
microscopic findings. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In rats, male fertility was not affected at TMR exposures up to 125 times the human exposure at the 
RHD despite testicular and epididymal toxicity. Female fertility and early pregnancy were also not 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 24/85 
 
  
 
 
adversely affected at exposures up to 186 times the human exposure at the RHD. While embryofetal 
exposure was demonstrated in a separate distribution study in pregnant rats with oral administration 
of 14C-FTR, no effects on embryofetal development were noted in this species at exposures up to 200 
times the human exposure at the RHD. In rabbits embryofetal development was also not affected at 
exposures up to 30 times the human exposure at the RHD. Prenatal and postnatal development 
including the attainment of puberty and learning memory in offspring was not influenced in rats at 
exposures up to 50 times the human exposure at the RHD. At maternal exposures that are up to 130 
times the human AUC at the RHD, reduced postnatal viability probably due to an increased lactational 
exposure to TMR was noted in the offspring. TMR is present in the milk of lactating rats and in the 
blood of the rat pups exposed through lactation. 
Local Tolerance  
Studies with FTR and TMR were carried out to assess worker health and safety hazards associated with 
manufacture of the drug product or to assess irritancy potential. The Local Lymph Node assay showed 
that FTR has the potential to cause skin sensitisation, while TMR showed no skin sensitizing potential. 
Neither  FTR  nor  TMR  showed  an  irritating  potential  in  the  rabbit.  TMR  was  also  negative  in  the 
Reconstructed Human Epidermal (RHE) model. In an Isolated Bovine Cornea assay, FTR was considered 
as a mild ocular irritant. TMR was a severe ocular irritant, causing serious eye damage in two Isolated 
Bovine Cornea assays. These worker safety studies have little relevance to patients administered oral 
FTR, the intended route of administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
• 
Immunotoxicity 
The potential effects of FTR on the T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) to KLH were evaluated 
in accordance with ICH S8 as part of the pivotal 26-week oral rat toxicity study. From this study there 
is no indication of an immunotoxic potential for FTR. 
• 
Impurities 
Impurities  and/or  degradants  have  been  evaluated  extensively  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  All 
impurities are considered adequately qualified with the specifications provided for the drug substance 
and drug product. 
•  Allergenic potential 
Two in vitro assays with blood cells from beta-lactam hypersensitive patients have been conducted to 
evaluate any allergenic potential associated with the beta-lactam structure in BMT-218946 a potential 
photodegradant of FTR. There was no clinically relevant evidence for a significant allergenic potential of 
BMT-218946. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr 
2).  
Fostemsavir is a pro-drug that is converted to temsavir in patients. Therefore, the environmental risk 
assessment has been conducted with the active substance temsavir. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 25/85 
 
  
 
 
The ERA provided is considered acceptable. The active substance is not expected to pose a risk to surface 
water, groundwater, microorganism and sediment compartment, as all risk quotients are below 1. A risk 
assessment for the terrestrial compartment was not required due to the low binding affinity of the active 
substance temsavir to sewage sludge. Temsavir is not a potential PBT substance. However, the active 
substance has to be classified as very persistent in sediments due to the half-life (DT50) of 209 days 
(normalised to 12°C, the average outdoor temperature in the EU).  
Overall, it can be concluded that temsavir will not pose a risk to the environment.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
At  present  the  ERA  for  temsavir  is  not  complete  as  the  identification  of  the  transformation  products 
>10%  of  the  water-sediment  system  is  required.  The  required  information  can  be  submitted  post 
authorisation. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In safety pharmacology studies regarding the cardiovascular system, moderate or weak effects of TMR 
were  observed  on  the  hERG  channel  and  on  rabbit  Purkinje  fiber  action  potential,  respectively.  In  a 
telemetry study in dogs a prolongation of QT interval at approximately 6-fold the human Cmax was seen. 
In a thorough QT study in healthy volunteers, a supratherapeutic dose of FTR (2.400 mg BID, which is 
4 times the recommended dose) for 7 days was associated with a clinically meaningful prolongation of 
the QTc interval, as the maximum mean time-matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence bound) for the 
placebo-adjusted change from baseline in QTcF interval was 11.2 (13.3) milliseconds.  
FTR  is  hydrolysed  to  TMR  by  alkaline  phosphatase  in  the  gastrointestinal  lumen.  The  conversion  is 
predominantly pre-systemic. TMR, BMS-646915 (a product of hydrolysis) and BMS-930644 (a product 
of N-dealkylation) were the predominant drug-related compounds in humans and animal species. The 
hydrolysis  pathway  leading  to  the  formation  of  BMS-646915  and  its  metabolites  is  the  predominate 
pathway in humans and toxicological species. Both metabolites (BMS-646915 and BMS-930644) were 
present  in  the  plasma  of  one  or  more  of  the  animal  species,  and  concentrations  near  Cmax  were 
comparable to concentrations in human plasma. As indicated in ICH M3 (R2), since human metabolite 
exposure  is  greater  than  10  percent  of  total  related  exposure,  nonclinical  characterisation  of  the 
metabolites (BMS-646915 and BMS-930644) was warranted. Both the rat and dog formed BMS-646915 
and  BMS-930644  at  adequate  exposure  levels  (greater  than  human  exposure).  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
considered that the metabolite’s contribution to the overall toxicity assessment has been established. 
In repeated-dose toxicity studies, the target organs of toxicity were testes, kidneys and adrenal gland 
in rats and liver in dogs. Testicular findings (degeneration of seminiferous epithelium, decreases in sperm 
motility  and  sperm  morphologic  alterations)  occurred  only  at  high  systemic  exposure  in  rats,  were 
partially reversible, not associated with effects on fertility and were not observed in dogs. Hence, the 
potential risk for testicular changes in humans is low. Renal findings (decreases in urine pH, renal tubular 
dilatation, increase kidney weight and urine volume) are considered of low concern in humans as they 
occurred  at  high  systemic  exposure  multiples  in  rats  and  were  not  observed  in  dogs.  Adrenal  gland 
findings  (angiectasis,  increased  gland  size  and  weight)  were  considered  of  minor  safety  concern  in 
humans as they occurred at high systemic exposures in animals. Liver toxicity (hepatic canalicular bile 
pigment deposits and lipofuscin pigment deposits in Kupffer cells) was considered to be of little safety 
concern in humans, as this was not associated with degenerative changes in the liver, not observed in 
rats at high exposure multiples and no FTR related liver findings were observed in the clinical trials at 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 27/85 
 
  
 
 
 
 
doses ≤1600 mg per day. Close monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended in patients with hepatitis 
B and/or C co-infection taking FTR. 
The prodrug FTR and the active drug TMR were tested in a standard battery according to ICHS2(R1) to 
evaluate the mutagenic potential. Test results gave no evidence of a relevant mutagenic potential of FTR 
or  TMR.  FTR  was  tested  in  a  2-year  life-time  bioassay  and  a  26-week  study  in  the  transgenic  mouse 
model Tg rasH2 for carcinogenic potential. FTR caused a dose dependent increase in mortality in male 
rats. This was however not associated with an increase in neoplastic changes and the reason remained 
unknown. In conclusion, no evidence for a relevant carcinogenic potential was found. 
Reproductive toxicity is not a cause for concern, even though the CHMP did not agree with some of the 
NOAEL values set in the respective study reports. Even when lowering the NOAELs, there was neither 
any toxicity in adult rats, other than that observed in the repeated dose studies. Male and female fertility 
was not affected at exposure up to 80 times the human exposure at the RHD, and prenatal and postnatal 
development was not compromised up to at least 30 times the human exposure at the RHD. 
Impurities  and/or  degradants  have  been  evaluated  extensively  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  All 
impurities are considered adequately qualified with the specifications provided for the drug substance 
and drug product.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of temsavir following administration of fostemsavir are similar between healthy 
and HIV-1 infected subjects. In HIV-1 infected subjects, the between-subject variability (%CV) in 
plasma temsavir Cmax and AUC ranged from 20.5 to 63% and C from 20 to 165%. Between-subject 
variability in oral clearance and oral central volume of distribution estimated from population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of healthy subjects from selected Phase I studies and HIV-1 infected patients 
were 43% and 48%, respectively. 
Absorption 
Fostemsavir is a prodrug that is metabolised to temsavir by alkaline phosphatase at the luminal 
surface of the small intestine and is generally not detectable in plasma following oral administration. 
The active moiety, temsavir, is readily absorbed with the median time to maximal plasma 
concentrations (Tmax) at 2 hours post dose (fasted). Temsavir is absorbed across the small intestine 
and caecum/proximal ascending colon.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters following multiple oral doses of fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily in HIV-1 
infected, adult subjects are shown in Table 2.

a.  Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral 
drugs. 
The absolute bioavailability of temsavir was 26.9% following oral administration of a single 600 mg 
dose of fostemsavir.  
Effect of Food 
Temsavir bioavailability (AUC) was not impacted by a standard meal (approximately 423 kcal, 36% 
fat) but increased 81% with a high-fat meal (approximately 985 kcal, 60% fat) and is not considered 
clinically significant. Regardless of calorie and fat content, food had no impact on plasma temsavir 
Cmax.  
Distribution 
Temsavir is approximately 88% bound to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data. Human serum 
albumin is the major contributor to plasma protein binding of temsavir in humans. The volume of 
distribution of temsavir at steady state (Vss) following intravenous administration is estimated at 
29.5 L. The blood-to-plasma total radiocarbon Cmax ratio was approximately 0.74, indicating minimal 
association of temsavir or its metabolites with red blood cells. Free fraction of temsavir in plasma was 
approximately 12 to 18% in healthy subjects, 23% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, and 
19% in subjects with severe renal impairment, and 12% in HIV-1 infected patients.  
Biotransormation and elimination 
In vivo, temsavir is primarily metabolised via esterase hydrolysis (36.1% of administered dose) and 
secondarily by CYP3A4-mediated oxidative (21.2% of administered dose) pathways. Other non-CYP3A4 
metabolites account for 7.2% of the administered dose. Glucuronidation is a minor metabolic pathway 
(<1% of administered dose). 
Temsavir is extensively metabolised, accounting for the fact that only 3% of the administered dose is 
recovered in human urine and faeces. Temsavir is biotransformed into two predominant circulating 
inactive metabolites, BMS-646915 (a product of hydrolysis) and BMS-930644 (a product of N-
dealkylation).  
Temsavir has a terminal half-life of approximately 11 hours. Plasma temsavir clearance following 
intravenous administration was 17.9 L/hr, and the apparent clearance (CL/F) following oral 
administration was 66.4 L/hr. After oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of 14C-labelled 
fostemsavir in a human mass balance study, 51% and 33% of the radioactivity was retrieved in the 
urine and faeces, respectively. Based on limited bile collection in this study (3 to 8 hours post dose), 
biliary clearance accounted for 5% of the radioactive dose, suggesting that a fraction of the faecal 
excretion is from biliary excretion.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following single and repeat administration of fostemsavir ER tablets, increases in plasma temsavir 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) appeared dose proportional, or slightly greater than dose proportional, in 
HIV-1 infected subjects. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 34/85 
 
  
 
 
 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of temsavir have not been evaluated in children and adolescents younger than 
18 years. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of temsavir using data in HIV-1 infected adults showed that there 
was no clinically relevant effect of age on temsavir exposure. Pharmacokinetic data for temsavir in 
subjects greater than 65 years old are limited. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-
induced QT interval prolongation. 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of temsavir after a single 600 mg dose of fostemsavir 
was evaluated in an open-label study in 30 adult subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, 
and severe renal impairment, and subjects with ESRD on haemodialysis (n=6 per group). Based on 
creatinine clearance (CLcr), as follows: 60 ≤ CLcr ≤89 (mild), 30 ≤ CLcr <60 (moderate), CLcr <30 
(severe, and ESRD on haemodialysis) mL/min, there was no clinically relevant effect of renal 
impairment on pharmacokinetic exposure parameters (Cmax and AUCs) of temsavir (total and 
unbound). The mean fu TMR for the severe renal impairment group was approximately 58% higher 
compared with the normal renal function group. The regression model-predicted average increases in 
plasma TMR (unbound fraction) Cmax and AUC were ≤15% and for AUCl ≤30% for the mild, moderate, 
and severe RI groups. Cmax (bound and unbound) was lower than the Cmax threshold of an approximate 
4.2-fold increase (7500 ng/ml) established based on temsavir exposure-response. Temsavir was not 
readily cleared by haemodialysis, with approximately 12.3% of the administered dose removed during 
the 4-hour haemodialysis session. Haemodialysis initiated 4 hours after temsavir dosing was 
associated with an average 46% increase in plasma total temsavir Cmax and an average 11% decrease 
in AUC relative to pharmacokinetics off haemodialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of temsavir after a single 600 mg dose of 
fostemsavir was evaluated in an open-label study in 30 adult subjects with normal (n=12), mild (Child-
Pugh Score A, n=6), moderate (Child-Pugh Score B, n=6), and severe (Child-Pugh Score C, n=6) 
hepatic impairment. In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment, the increased exposure to 
both unbound and total Cmax and AUC was in the range of 1.2- to 2.2-fold. However, the upper bounds 
of the 2-sided 90% CI for the impact of hepatic impairment on plasma total and unbound temsavir 
Cmax are lower than the Cmax threshold of an approximate 4.2-fold increase (7500 ng/ml) established 
based on temsavir exposure-response. 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure of 
temsavir. Of the 764 subjects included in the analysis, 216 (28%) were female. 
Race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of 
temsavir.  
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 35/85 
 
  
 
 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Significant interactions are not expected when fostemsavir is co-administered with substrates of CYPs, 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs), P-gp, multidrug resistance protein (MRP)2, bile 
salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), OAT1, OAT3, 
organic cation transporters (OCT)1, and OCT2 based on in vitro and clinical drug interaction data. 
Based on in vitro data, temsavir and its two metabolites (BMS-646915 and BMS-930644) inhibited 
multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1/2K. This interaction is unlikely to be of clinical 
significance. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fostemsavir is a prodrug without significant antiviral activity that is hydrolysed to the active moiety, 
temsavir, upon cleavage of a phosphonooxymethyl group in vivo. Temsavir binds directly to the gp120 
subunit within the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 and selectively inhibits the interaction between 
the virus and cellular CD4 receptor, thereby preventing viral entry into, and infection of, host cells.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Antiviral activity in cell culture 
Temsavir  exhibited  variable  activity  across  HIV-1  subtypes.  Temsavir  IC50  value  ranged  from  0.01  to 
>2000 nM against clinical isolates of subtypes A, B, B', C, D, F, G and CRF01_AE in PBMCs. Temsavir 
was  not  active  against  HIV-2.  Due  to  high  frequencies  of  polymorphism  S375H  (98%)  and 
S375M/M426L/M434I (100%) temsavir is not active against Group O and Group N. 
Against a panel of 1337 clinical isolates tested with the PhenoSense Entry assay, the mean IC50 value 
was 1.73 nM (range 0.018 to >5000 nM). Isolates tested included subtype B (n=881), C (n=156), F1 
(n=48), A (n=43), BF1 (n=29), BF (n=19), A1 (n=17) and CRF01_AE (n=5). Subtype CRF01_AE was 
associated  with  higher  IC50  values  (5/5  isolates  with  temsavir  IC50  values  >100  nM).  CRF01_AE  is 
considered  naturally  resistant  to  temsavir  on  the  basis  of  available  data,  due  to  the  presence  of 
polymorphisms at positions S375H and M475I. 
Antiviral activity in combination with other antiviral agents 
When tested with temsavir in vitro, no antagonism was seen with abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, 
lamivudine,  stavudine,  tenofovir  disoproxil,  zidovudine,  efavirenz,  nevirapine,  atazanavir,  indinavir, 
lopinavir,  ritonavir,  saquinavir,  enfuvirtide,  maraviroc,  ibalizumab,  delavirdine,  rilpivirine,  darunavir, 
dolutegravir or raltegravir. In addition, antivirals without inherent anti-HIV activity (entecavir, ribavirin) 
have no apparent effect on temsavir activity. 
Resistance in vitro 
Serial passage of lab-strains LAI, NL4-3, or Bal, in increasing concentrations of temsavir (TMR) over 14 
to 49 days resulted in gp120 substitutions at L116, A204, M426, M434 and M475. Phenotypes of 
recombinant LAI viruses containing TMR-selected substitutions were investigated. Additionally, 
phenotypes of viruses with substitutions at position S375 that were identified in pre-treatment samples 
in fostemsavir clinical studies were evaluated. The phenotypes of those considered clinically relevant 
are presented in Table 3.

Note: The phenotype of substitutions at L116 and A204 have been excluded from the table as they are not 
considered clinically relevant. 
Temsavir remained active against laboratory derived CD4-independent viruses. Treatment with 
fostemsavir is therefore unlikely to promote resistance to temsavir via generation of CD4 independent 
virus. 
Cross-Resistance 
There  was  no  evidence  of  cross-resistance  to  other  antiretrovirals  (ARVs).  Temsavir  retained  activity 
against viruses resistant to the INSTI raltegravir; the NNRTI rilpivirine; the NRTIs abacavir, lamivudine, 
tenofovir, zidovudine; the PIs atazanavir and darunavir and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.    
Some CCR5-tropic, maraviroc-resistant viruses showed reduced susceptibility to temsavir. Both the CD4-
directed  post-attachment  inhibitor  ibalizumab  and  the  gp120-directed  pre-attachment  inhibitor 
fostemsavir develop resistance associated mutations in gp120. In clinical isolates five of seven viruses 
resistant  to  ibalizumab  retained  susceptibility  to  temsavir  while  the  other  two  viruses  had  reduced 
susceptibility to both temsavir (>1,400-fold decreased susceptibility) and ibalizumab.  
Additionally, maraviroc, ibalizumab and enfuvirtide retained activity against site-directed mutants with 
reduced susceptibility to temsavir, or against clinical envelopes with reduced baseline susceptibility to 
temsavir and contained S375H, M426L, or M426L plus M475I substitutions.

functional monotherapy at Day 8 was assessed in the Phase III study (BRIGHTE [205888]) in heavily 
treatment-experienced adult subjects. The presence of gp120 RAPs at key sites S375, M426, M434, or 
M475 was associated with a lower overall decline in HIV-1 RNA and fewer subjects achieving >0.5 log10 
decline in HIV-1 RNA compared with subjects with no changes at these sites (Table 4).  
The fold change in susceptibility to temsavir for subject isolates at screening was highly variable 
ranging from 0.06 to 6,651. The effect of screening fostemsavir phenotype on response of >0.5 log10 
decline at Day 8 was assessed in the ITT-E population (Table 5). While there does appear to be a trend 
toward reduced clinical response at higher TMR IC50 values, this baseline variable fails to reliably 
predict efficacy outcomes in the intended use population.

Antiviral activity against subtype AE 
Within  HIV-1  Group  M,  temsavir  showed  considerably  reduced  antiviral  activity  against  subtype  AE 
isolates.  Rukobia  is  not  recommended  to  be  used  to  treat  infections  due  to  HIV-1  Group  M  subtype 
CRF01_AE strains. Genotyping of subtype AE viruses identified polymorphisms at amino acid positions 
S375H  and  M475I  in  gp120,  which  have  been  associated  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  fostemsavir. 
Subtype AE is a predominant subtype in Southeast Asia, but it is not found frequently elsewhere. 
Two subjects in the Randomised Cohort had subtype AE virus at screening. One subject (EC50 fold change 
>4,747-fold and gp120 substitutions at S375H and M475I at baseline) did not respond to fostemsavir at 
Day  8.  The  second  subject  (EC50  fold  change  298-fold  and  gp120  substitution  at  S375N  at  baseline) 
EMA/702367/2020

received placebo during functional monotherapy. Both subjects had HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 96 
while receiving fostemsavir plus OBT that included dolutegravir. 
Emergence of Resistance in vivo 
The percentage of subjects who experienced virologic failure through the Week 96 analysis was 25% 
(69/272) in the randomised cohort (Table 9). Overall, 50% (26/52) of the viruses of evaluable subjects 
with virologic failure in the Randomised Cohort had treatment-emergent gp120 genotypic substitutions 
at 4 key sites (S375, M426, M434, and M475). 
The median temsavir EC50 fold change at failure in randomised evaluable subject isolates with 
emergent gp120 substitutions at positions 375, 426, 434, or 475 (n = 26) was 1,755-fold compared to 
3-fold for isolates with no emergent gp120 substitutions at these positions (n = 26).  
Of the 25 evaluable subjects in the Randomised Cohort with virologic failure and emergent 
substitutions S375N and M426L and (less frequently) S375H/M, M434I and M475I, 88% (22/25) had 
temsavir IC50 FC Ratio > 3-fold (FC Ratio is temsavir IC50 FC on-treatment compared to baseline). 
Overall, 21/69 (30%) of the virus isolates of patients with virologic failure in the Randomised Cohort 
had genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in the OBT at screening and in 48% 
(31/64) of the virologic failures with post-baseline data the virus isolates had emergent resistance to 
at least one drug in the OBT.  
In the Non-randomised Cohort virologic failures were observed in 51% (50/99) through Week 96 
(Table 6). While the proportion of viruses with gp120 resistance-associated substitutions at screening 
was similar between patients in the Randomised and Non-randomised Cohorts, the proportion of virus 
isolates with emergent gp120 resistance-associated substitutions at the time of failure was higher 
among Non-randomised patients (75% vs. 50%). The median temsavir EC50 fold change at failure in 
Non-randomised evaluable subject isolates with emergent substitutions at positions 375, 426, 434, or 
475 (n = 33) was 4,216-fold and compared to 402-fold for isolates without substitutions at these 
positions (n = 11).  
Of the 32 evaluable virologic failures in the Non-randomised Cohort with emergent substitutions S375N 
and M426L and (less frequently) S375H/M, M434I and M475I, 91% (29/32) had temsavir IC50 FC Ratio 
> 3-fold. 
Overall, 45/50 (90%) of the viruses of patients with virologic failure in the Non-randomised Cohort had 
genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in the OBT at screening and in 55% (27/49) of 
the virologic failures with post-baseline data the virus isolates had emergent resistance to at least one 
drug in the OBT.

Secondary pharmacology 
In a randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, cross-over thorough QT study, 60 healthy 
subjects received oral administration of placebo, fostemsavir 1,200 mg once daily, fostemsavir 2,400 mg 
twice daily and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. Fostemsavir administered at 
1, 200 mg once daily did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the QTc interval as the maximum 
mean time-matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence bound) placebo-adjusted QTc change from baseline 
based on Fridericia’s correction method (QTcF) was 4.3 (6.3) milliseconds (below the clinically important 
threshold of 10 milliseconds). However, fostemsavir administered at 2, 400 mg twice daily for 7 days 
was associated with a clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval as the maximum mean time-
matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence bound) for the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in QTcF 
interval  was  11.2  (13.3)  milliseconds.  Steady-state  administration  of  fostemsavir  600  mg  twice  daily 
resulted in a mean temsavir Cmax approximately 4.2-fold lower than the temsavir concentration predicted 
to increase QTcF interval 10 milliseconds. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of TMR, the active moiety of prodrug FTR, has been characterised in 27 clinical Phase 1 studies. 
The commercially intended ER tablet formulation, V600-027, was only used in four Phase 1 studies 
(206295, 206218, 206219, 206288) and the Phase 3 study. The majority of drug interaction studies 
and the studies in renal and hepatic impairment were conducted using the Phase 2b formulation.  
Bridging  the  different  formulations  used  and  applicability  of  the  results  obtained  with  the  earlier 
formulations  to  the  Phase  3/intended  commercial  formulation  were  supported  by  one  relative 
bioavailability study and additional comparative in vitro dissolution data.  
The food effect has been characterised for FTR administration with standard or high-fat meals. Taking 
FTR routinely with high kcal/fat meals was unlikely to substantially improve the antiviral effect that 
would outweigh the practicalities and health issues that could be associated with advice to take it with 
such meals. Overall, the CHMP concluded that fostemsavir can be taken with or without food.  
A potential difference in PK between healthy volunteers and HIV patients was investigated and 
revealed a 17% higher clearance in healthy volunteers which was considered not to be clinically 
relevant.  
The PK data were not considered to warrant dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment or 
those on haemodialysis or patients with hepatic impairment. This has been reflected in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 41/85 
 
  
 
 
 
The clinical relevance of certain degrees of a decreased or increased TMR exposure was difficult to 
judge based on the shallow exposure-response relationship and unclear therapeutic window of FTR, 
impeding interpretation of the decreases in TMR exposure observed in some of the DDI studies. Based 
on the clinical DDI studies, the exposure-response analysis of TMR exposure, popPK analysis and data 
from studies 205888 and 205889, a contraindication for co-administration of FTR with strong CYP3A 
inducers was considered appropriate. This should address concerns related to loss of efficacy if FTR is 
given with strong CYP3A inducers and concerns related to effects on safety (especially QTc). Since 
there is currently not enough evidence to expect that moderate CYP3A inducers would have a clinically 
important effect on TMR, no additional warning statements beyond information presented in section 
4.5 of the SmPC were considered needed. 
In general, the antiviral activity of TMR has been demonstrated. Resistance to TMR developed fast and 
at low concentrations in vitro. Resistance development has revealed key polymorphisms M426L, 
S375I/M/H/Y/T/N, M475I/T and M434I that significantly decrease the susceptibility to TMR. Double 
mutations at key positions enhanced the decrease in susceptibility and are the underlying cause of 
CRF01_AE intrinsic resistance to TMR (S375H + M475I). The database was very comprehensive, but 
the use of varying background strains (LAI, Bal, NL-4-3), clinical isolates from various subtypes 
differing geno- and phenotypically as well as regarding co-receptor tropism, made it difficult to 
compare the results. This limits reliability of interpretation to some degree. The observed intra-
individual variabilities in susceptibility to TMR were also considered to contribute to this effect. The 
phenotypic effect exerted by genotypic changes varied depending on the viral background, even 
though the tendencies of the effect seemed comparable. Nevertheless, this variability could impair the 
prediction of the extent of the phenotypic manifestation based on the genotypic changes.  
Large variability in susceptibility to TMR was seen in vitro and across clinical trials. Generally, presence 
of key resistance substitutions in the gp160 domain was correlated with greatly decreased TMR 
susceptibility in vitro and subsequent clinical response to treatment, although with exceptions. 
Different HIV-1 subtypes exhibited a wide range of susceptibility to TMR. In addition, this was 
accompanied by substantial intra-subject variability, indicating that response and susceptibility to TMR 
in the presence of envelopes containing signature changes seem to be context-dependent. In addition, 
the correlation of genotypic changes with their phenotypic susceptibility was further complicated, as for 
many participants at least one of the analyses was not available.  
Efforts to identify a specific clinical guidance to reliably select patients most and least likely to respond 
to FTR were made and additional analyses of the available data were performed. However, these 
analyses showed only imperfect correlations between baseline and on-treatment virologic factors and 
virologic response. Based on the available data, the CHMP considered that it is currently not possible to 
derive a specific guidance to reliably select those patients most (and least likely) to respond. Overall, 
despite the undisputed imperfect correlations, the nonclinical and clinical data suggested that 
decreased susceptibility to TMR may occur relatively frequently during FTR treatment, which can 
impact on the virologic outcome. 
The baseline data from the three efficacy studies indicated that there are HIV-1 strains in circulation 
that could be expected to have a low likelihood of responding to FTR 600 mg BID. Further exploration 
of the available clinical data, including considerations as to whether patients should be tested for TMR 
IC50, substitutions and HIV-1 subtype to avoid potentially ineffective treatment, did not identify a 
clear correlation between virologic factors associated with non-response. However, some 
polymorphisms and combinations thereof, seemed to be indicative of a negative treatment outcome 
(M426L, S375N, M434I), but the individual effect of these polymorphisms was highly variable and 
context-dependent. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 42/85 
 
  
 
 
Treatment-emergent genotypic substitutions in gp160 at one or more of the four positions of interest 
were seen frequently across the clinical trials and were a cause of concern. FTR appeared to have a low 
barrier to selection of virus with substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility, as well as for 
selection of virus with increased TMR IC50 in the absence of gp160 substitutions at the applicant’s 
identified positions of interest. It was not always clear why some patients experienced virologic failure 
to the FTR regimen. This raised concerns as to whether there could be other substitutions of 
importance. Emergence of substitutions S375N and M426L and to a lesser frequency S375H/M, M434I 
and M475I in combination with TMR IC50FC > 3 fold seemed to be associated with virologic failure. 
Hence, the data suggested a relatively low barrier to selection of substitutions potentially associated 
with reduced TMR susceptibility. 
Furthermore, treatment emergent genotypic substitutions to the OBT in patients with PDVF were 
observed quite frequently in both cohorts of study 205888, including resistance to NNRTIs, INSTIs, PIs 
and NRTIs (36%, 29%, 15% and 10%, respectively). In addition, treatment-emergent phenotypic 
changes to the OBT were observed quite frequently in patients with PDVF in both cohorts, including 
resistance to CCR5 antagonist, entry inhibitor, NNRTI, INSTI, NRTI and PI (50%, 38%, 14%, 14%, 
13% and 7%). In addition, the study 205889 finding that treatment-emergent resistance to the RAL 
backbone has developed more often in participants who experienced virologic failure while on a FTR 
regimen, compared to the reference regimen (ATV/r, TDF, RAL), further supported this assumption. 
Based on these data, it could not be excluded that FTR has a lower barrier to resistance compared to 
other ARVs and thus, it may favour development of resistance-associated mutations in the OBT, 
especially to NNRTIs, INSTIs, CCR5 antagonists and entry inhibitors. However, due to the missing 
control arm in the Phase 3 study (205888), increase in the development of resistance to the OBT could 
not be thoroughly assessed. 
Based on the provided Phase 2a data, there was no clear dose-response effect on viral load decline for 
the different dosing regimens. Exploratory exposure-response relationship from the monotherapy 
study indicated that baseline viral drug susceptibility (expressed as IC50) was the most influential 
factor in determining the magnitude of decline in HIV RNA. IC50 baseline values ≥100 nM seemed to be 
associated with a decreased antiviral activity. 
A supratherapeutic dose (at a Cmax approximately 4.2-fold the therapeutic dose) of fostemsavir has 
been shown to significantly prolong the QTc interval. FTR should be used with caution in patients with 
a history of QT interval prolongation, when co-administered with a medicine with a known risk of 
Torsade de Pointes or in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. This was reflected as a 
warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data supported granting the marketing authorisation. Based on the available 
data, the CHMP concluded that the antiviral activity is confined to HIV-1 group M strains (except 
CRF01_AE strains), as detailed in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

This was a phase 2b, randomised, active-controlled, blinded-to-FTR, multi-centre trial in treatment-
experienced HIV-1 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of 4 doses of FTR (Figure 2). Subjects 
were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to 400 mg FTR BID, 800 mg FTR BID, 600 mg FTR QD, 1200 mg FTR QD 
or a control regimen containing atazanavir boosted with ritonavir (ATV/r). Each treatment group 
received raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg BID plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg QD as the 
backbone. The study consisted of an elective 7-day monotherapy substudy and the primary study was 
divided into stage 1 (which included 96 weeks of combination therapy and was characterised by 
frequent study visits) and stage 2 (post-week 96 treatment, characterised by visits every 12 weeks). A 
subset of subjects (~10 subjects per FTR treatment group) who were not receiving ART at Screening 
(and for ~ 4 weeks prior) were selected to participate in the monotherapy substudy for 7 days. When 
the last subject completed 8 weeks of treatment, there was a planned Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) Review (Week 8 interim analysis). The DMC recommended that all subjects continue in the 
study and that all subjects remained blinded to the dose of FTR until the Week 48 analysis. 
After the Week 48 analysis, all subjects randomised to 1 of the 4 FTR treatment groups were switched 
to the chosen continuation dose of 1200 mg FTR QD over time (from Week 64 to Week 110) which they 
received as open label therapy along with the continued background regimen of RAL and TDF. 
Week 192 was the latest time point that all treated subjects had the opportunity to complete prior to 
conclusion of the Phase 2b study.

Figure 2: Design of Study 205889  
Study Participants 
Subjects enrolled in this study were ARV treatment experienced (defined as current or previous exposure 
to at least 1 week of at least 1 ARV drug) adult subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/ml and a 
baseline TMR IC50 <0.1 µM. Moreover, they were naïve to treatment with any integrase inhibitor and had 
a CD4+ T-cell count >50 cells/mm3. Subjects with any genotypic resistance to one drug of the study 
regimen (TDF, ATV, RAL) were excluded from the study. 
Treatments 
Subjects who participated in the monotherapy substudy began dosing with only FTR at the randomised 
dose for 7 days on Day 1 of monotherapy, after which dosing in the combination therapy phase began 
EMA/702367/2020

for these subjects. Subjects who did not participate in the monotherapy substudy began dosing with all 
3 study drugs on Day 1 of combination therapy (stage 1 of the primary study). The ER formulation of 
FTR used in study 205889 differs from the to-be-marketed ER formulation (663068-V600-027). All study 
medication was taken with food. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at 
Week 24 using the FDA snapshot algorithm. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Stratified by TMR phenotypic sensitivity (IC50 <0.0013 µM or IC50 ≥0.0013 µM), eligible subjects were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. All subjects and investigators were blinded to the dose of FTR 
from Day 1 of the study. After determination of the continuation dose and after the Week 48 study 
analysis, those subjects randomised to 1 of the 4 blinded FTR groups received open-label FTR at the 
continuation dose of 1200 mg QD, marking the end of the partially blinded phase of the study, while 
subjects in the control arm were retained on open-label ATV/r 300/100 mg QD. 
Statistical methods 
This was an estimation study and sample size calculations were not based on power. A target sample 
size of 50 subjects per group was selected to provide sufficiently tight confidence interval for the primary 
endpoint.  
The trial was not planned to be comparative and only aimed to estimate effects within each group. In 
line with this study aim, only descriptive statistics were provided and no statistical comparisons were 
made. Efficacy evaluations were primarily based on  the ITT-E population consisting of all randomised 
subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment  (similar  definition  for  the  monotherapy 
substudy).  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <50  copies/ml  at  Week  24  (primary 
endpoint)  and  other  time  points  was  assessed  based  on  the  FDA  snapshot  algorithm  and  the  ITT-E 
population (i.e. denominator is based on all treated subjects). As a supportive analysis, evaluation was 
also  based  on  only  the  observed  case  in  the  ITT-E  population  (i.e.  denominator  is  based  on  treated 
subjects with available plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement). Response rates are presented by treatment 
regimen with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. All other secondary endpoints are only evaluated 
descriptively based on observed data. 
Considering  the  high  and  partly  differential  missing  data  rates,  evaluations  based  on  observed  cases 
(including response evaluations based on the ITT-E observed population) are of limited value, especially 
when  opposing  different  study  arms,  as  the  stratum  of  patients  not  discontinuing  the  study 
treatment/study and surviving may be quite different between study arms.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 581 subjects were screened, of which 251 subjects were randomised and treated. The most 
common reason for failing screening was plasmatic HIV-1 RNA ≤1000 copies/ml at Screening. Overall, 
48% of subjects withdrew from the study (34% to 56% across the 4 FTR arms and 57% in the reference 
arm). In total, 19 subjects (8%) were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy. 10-18% of participants per arm 
withdrew consent; the underlying reasons for this were not specified.  
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar across treatment groups. Overall, 40% of subjects 
were women, 30% were Black/African American and 30% of subjects were of mixed race. The median 
age  was  39.1  years  (Table  7).  Baseline  disease  characteristics  were  similar  across  treatment  groups, 
most subjects were infected with HIV-1 subtype B or C, 43% had a viral load of >100,000 RNA copies/ml, 
and 38% had a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/µl. All subjects (except of 1) had a baseline TMR IC50 <0.1 
µm in accordance with the inclusion criteria (Table 8. Most subjects (64%) had an IC50 <0.0013 µM.

Numbers analysed 
All  subjects  randomised  and  treated  in  the  monotherapy  substudy  and  in  the  primary  analyses  were 
included in the ITT-E and safety population. 
Analyses with the per protocol (PP) population have not been conducted due to the small sample size 
and hence lack of any statistical power. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 24 
(by FDA snapshot algorithm). The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 
24  (ITT-E)  was  similar  across  all  4  FTR  treatment  groups  (70%  to  80%)  and  comparable  with  the 
response in subjects randomised to the reference group (75%) (Table 9).

Table 9 Summary of Proportion of Subjects with Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 24 (ITT-E-
Population; Snapshot Algorithm) 
When the last subject completed 24 weeks of treatment with study therapy, BMS conducted an analysis 
of the Week 24 data to determine which dose of FTR was to be selected as the optimal continuation dose 
in the open-label phase of the study. Although the 400 mg BID and 600 mg QD dose led to a slightly 
higher virologic response at Week 24, the FTR 1200 mg QD was chosen as continuation dose based on 
graphical  exploration  of  the  E-R-relationship  from  the  monotherapy  substudy  and  the  Phase  2a  POC 
study (206267).  
The number of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 48 in the different treatment arms was 
comparable to the Week 24 results. The highest response rate was seen in the FTR 400 mg BID group. 
However, from Week 64 to Week 110 all subjects were switched to the continuation dose of 1200 mg 
FTR QD. At Week 192, 53% of subjects taking FTR were virologically suppressed compared to 43% in 
the control arm (Table 10). Generally, the efficacy of FTR + RAL + TDF over 192 weeks was comparable 
to the reference arm.

2.5.2.  Main study 
Study 205888 (BRIGTE) 
Methods 
Study 205888 is an ongoing Phase 3 study conducted in HIV-1-infected heavily treatment-experienced 
(HTE)  adult  subjects  infected  with  MDR  HIV-1.  Subjects  were  assigned  to  the  randomised  or  non-
randomised cohort based on the number of fully active ARV agents that could be used to construct a 
background regimen (Figure 3).  
Randomised Cohort 
Subjects with MDR HIV-1 infection on a currently failing ARV regimen with at least one fully active ARV 
in ≤2 ARV classes that could be combined with FTR as part of a viable new regimen were assigned to 
the randomised cohort. They were randomised 3:1 to treatment for 8 days with double-blinded FTR 600 
mg BID or placebo, respectively, added to their current failing regimen (functional monotherapy). After 
Day 8, all subjects received open-label FTR 600 mg BID in combination with OBT for at least 96 weeks. 
Non-randomised Cohort 
Subjects with zero remaining fully active ARVs due to resistance, intolerability or other safety concerns 
were assigned to the non-randomised cohort. Starting on Day 1, subjects received open-label FTR 600 
mg BID in combination with OBT for at least 96 weeks. 
Figure 3 Design of Study 205888
1.  Subjects in the randomised cohort begin open label (OL) dosing on Day 9. Subjects in the non-randomised 
cohort begin open-label dosing on Day 1. 
2.  The start of OL FTR 600 mg BID is used as the marker from which all other visits will be measured (i.e. the 
Week 4 visit for subjects in the randomised cohort will occur 4 weeks after the Day visit; the week 4 visit 
for subjects in the non-randomised cohort will occur 4 weeks after the Day 1 visit. 
3.  The study is expected to be conducted until an additional option, a rollover study or marketing approval, is 
in place.

Study Participants  
Study  participants  were  heavily  treatment-experienced  HIV-1  infected  male  and  female  subjects  ≥18 
years of age with a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/ml and a documented historical or baseline 
resistance, intolerability and/or contraindications to ARVs in at least 3 classes.  
Subjects in the randomised cohort were on their current failing regimen and had at least 1 fully active 
and available agent in ≤2 ARV classes due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations whereas 
subjects with zero remaining fully-active ARVs were assigned to the non-randomised cohort. 
While the inclusion criteria defined that full activity of at least 2 drugs from a maximum of two classes 
should be shown, it was not specified, how many partially active drugs may be available and used for 
the construction of the OBT. Thus, patients in the randomised cohort had up to 6 ARVs in their initial 
OBT.  
Some non-efficacy OBT changes were allowed during the study that did not impact the Snapshot analysis. 
These included e.g. changes in one or more ARV in virologically suppressed subjects. Reasons for non-
efficacy OBT changes were drug intolerance or adverse events, replacement of a drug due to sourcing 
issues or addition of TDF for the management of hepatitis co-infection. 
Patients with current cardiac abnormalities or a history of cardiac disease were excluded from the study 
based on the results of the QTc study 206275 showing that a supratherapeutic dose of FTR (2400 mg 
BID) significantly prolong the QTc interval in healthy adult subjects. 
Treatments 
Subjects in the randomised cohort received 1 tablet 600 mg FTR or placebo orally twice daily from Day 
1 to Day 8 together with their current failing regimen. From Day 9, subjects were administered 1 tablet 
600 mg FTR orally twice daily plus the OBT. Patients of the non-randomised cohort started taking 600 
mg FTR orally twice daily with OBT from Day 1. FTR was taken with or without food. 
Other investigational products were only allowed in the non-randomised cohort. 
The formulation used in the Phase 3 is the to-be-marketed 600 mg prolonged release formulation which 
differs from the formulation used in the Phase 2b study. The 600 mg BID prolonged-release regimen has 
not been studied clinically, but it has been selected based on modelling of E-R relationships on the one 
hand and on the assessment of risk of QT-interval prolongation on the other hand, using an integrated 
approach.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the antiviral effect of FTR relative to placebo, when given on 
the background of a failing regimen from Day 1 to Day 8 in the randomised cohort. Secondary objectives 
were assessment of durability of response and assessment of safety.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the mean change of log10 HIV-RNA (copies/ml) relative to placebo from Day 
1  (baseline)  to  Day  8  in  the  randomised  cohort.  The  key  secondary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/ml over time (Week 24, 48 and 96) in both cohorts using the FDA 
snapshot algorithm in which subjects without an HIV-1 RNA value at the relevant time point or those 
who changed OBT due to lack of efficacy were considered as failures. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 51/85 
 
  
 
 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Based on entry criteria, subjects were assigned to either the randomised cohort or the non-randomised 
cohort.  Stratified  by  screening  HIV-1  RNA  ≤1000  or  >1000  copies/ml,  subjects  assigned  to  the 
randomised cohort were then randomised to blinded treatment with either FTR or placebo, in a 3:1 ratio. 
Subjects  recruited  into  the  non-randomised  cohort  were  assigned  directly  to  open  label  FTR  in 
combination with OBT. 
Day 1 to Day 8 was a blinded period of dosing with FTR or placebo for the subjects in the randomised 
cohort. Following Day 8, subjects in the randomised cohort received open-label FTR. 
Blinding was not applicable to the non-randomised cohort and on Day 1, subjects in the non-randomised 
cohort began taking open-label FTR. 
Statistical methods 
Sample size was overall mainly driven by requirements for the size of the safety database. During the 
conduct  of  the  study,  the  planned  sample  size  in  the  original  protocol  (approx.  200  subjects  for  the 
randomised  cohort  and  approximately  170-240  for  the  non-randomised  cohort)  (Amendment  13; 
04.02.2016) was changed to at least 140 subjects for the randomised cohort and at least 260 overall). 
This  change  was  implemented  prior  to  the  first interim  analysis  and unblinding  of  data.  Furthermore, 
140 subjects in the randomised cohort still guarantee a power of more than 95% to show superiority of 
FTR over placebo assuming a 3:1 randomisation, two-sided alpha- level of 5%, a 0.5 log10 difference 
between  the  groups,  and  a  common  standard  deviation  of  0.6  log10.  In  the  end,  272  subjects  were 
included  in  the  randomised  cohort  and  99  in  the  non-randomised  cohort.  The  higher  than  planned 
number of subjects in the randomised cohort was a result of anticipating a long recruitment time due to 
the level of rigor in the inclusion criteria and initiating a high number of centres worldwide. Hence, during 
the planned enrollment period, more subjects than anticipated were recruited. This did not affect validity 
of results.  
Efficacy evaluations will be based primarily on the ITT-E population, containing all randomised subjects 
receiving treatment at least once. Additionally, evaluations based on the per-protocol population were 
planned containing all subjects in the ITT-E population who comply with the protocol. 
To show superiority of FTR vs placebo, the primary endpoint (mean change in log10 HIV-1 RNA from Day 
1 at Day 8 in the randomised cohort) will be analysed by means of a one-way analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with a factor for treatment and Day 1 log10 HIV-1 RNA as a covariate. This model assumes 
homogeneous error variance and homogeneous slope between treatments. Missing HIV-1 RNA values at 
Day 8 are imputed using (a) Day 1 Observation Carried Forward (D1OCF) for subjects without a value 
during blinded treatment, and (b) Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for subjects with an early 
value  during  blinded  treatment.  Three  sensitivity  analyses  were  planned  for  the  primary  endpoint, 
including  analysis  that  change  the  assumptions  underlying  the  primary  ANCOVA  model  and  analysis 
based  on  the  per-protocol  population.  Sensitivity  analysis  with  regard  to  alternative  missing  data 
handling were not conducted. However, given the low missing data rate during the short double-blinded 
study period (<5%), this is not a concern.  
Regarding secondary endpoints, absolute and percentage change in CD4+ T-cell from Day 1 to Day 8 as 
well as change in biomarkers from Day 1 to Day 8 will analyses as the primary endpoint, except that 
that the corresponding Day 1 value will be used as a covariate. For proportion of HIV-1 RNA decreases 
from Day 1 that exceed 0.5 log10 and 1.0 log10 at Day 8, 95% Newcombe confidence intervals for the 
difference in proportions will be provided. These responder analyses treat patients with missing data as 
failure. To assess durability of response (Week 24/48/96) the FDA snapshot algorithm will be applied. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 52/85 
 
  
 
 
For all other secondary/exploratory endpoints and for the analysis of the non-randomised cohort, only 
descriptive statistics will be provided. 
For the non-randomised cohort and open-label period (beyond Day 8) of the randomised cohort, except 
for the evaluation of durability of response, where missing HIV-1 RNA values are handled according to 
the FDA snapshot algorithm, analyses are generally based on observed data. That is, in this uncontrolled 
setting,  estimates  based  on  observed  cases  correspond  to  the  effect  in  the  stratum  of  patients  not 
discontinuing the study treatment/study and surviving. They should be interpreted as such, and results 
should be assessed in combination with the probability to be (not be) in this stratum. In addition, for 
viral  load,  it  seems  more  relevant  to  look  at  responder  criterions  and  according  to  the  FDA  snapshot 
algorithm a patient with missing data cannot be considered a responder which is acceptable. 
The  study  is  currently  ongoing,  and  three  interim  analyses  were  conducted  so  far.  The  first  interim 
analysis was conducted after the last subject (randomised or non-randomised) completed the Week 24 
visit and occurred on 7th February 2017 with a source data lock of 21st July 2017. This interim analysis 
included  evaluation  of  the  randomised,  double-blind  period  (including  primary  endpoint).  The  second 
(third) interim analysis was planned after the last subject completed the Week 48 (96) visit and occurred 
on 26th July 2017 with a source data lock of 4th March 2018 (22nd June 2018 with a source data lock of 
14th August 2018). The final analysis will occur at the close of the study. One or more optional interim 
analyses may be conducted after the Week 96 interim analysis and before the final analysis. 
For each interim analysis, a study report was written. The Week 96 study report is inclusive of all data 
from previous interim analyses and supersedes the prior reports. According to the Week 96 report, the 
analysis outputs for Week 24 (including the Day 8 primary efficacy data) and Week 48 were rerun 
using data current as of the Week 96 data lock. Hence, prior data outputs for Week 24 and Week 48 
differ slightly between the data lock points. This was a result of using only snapshots of the database 
for the different interim analyses, which were subject to changes (i.e. dataset used were not locked). 
Not locking dataset for (interim) analyses is generally not acceptable as changes subsequent to 
unblinding and analysis may be impacted by results and introduce bias. However, this issue was 
extensively discussed with the applicant during review and during the inspection. It was concluded that 
this issue did not impact the validity of the primary endpoint results as laboratory values upon which 
the primary and most secondary endpoints were based were not changed. Primary endpoint results are 
identical regardless of the snapshot (week 24, 48 or 96) used and results for virological responders 
were not relevantly impacted. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 731 subjects were screened for this study, of which 371 subjects were enrolled and treated 
with at least 1 dose of FTR. 272 subjects were assigned to the randomised cohort (FTR group: n=203, 
placebo group: n=69) and 99 subjects were assigned to the non-randomised cohort (Figure 4). The two 
most common reasons for failing screening were having more than 2 ARV classes remaining at Screening 
and/or not failing the current ARV regimen with a confirmed plasma HIV-RNA ≥400 copies/ml.  
The number of patients excluded from the analysis due to PDVF increased over time. Until Week 96, 63 
subjects  (23%)  in  the  randomised  cohort  experienced  a  PDVF  and  49  subjects  (49%)  in  the  non-
randomised cohort.

Conduct of the study 
The study had an unusual high amount of protocol deviations (at least one deviation in 94% of 
subjects included in the study). Moreover, there were no preventive and corrective actions to resolve 
recurrence of deviations since the occurrence of deviations such as “missing endpoint assessment” and 
“informed consent process” increased over time. The ineffective measures to reduce the amount of 
protocol deviations were considered of concern by the GCP inspectors. However, the protocol deviation 
evaluation did not exert a meaningful impact on the ITT or PP population. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar across the two cohorts and across the placebo and 
FTR groups. 22% of subjects were women, 22% were black and 44% were ≥ 50 years of age (Table 
11). 86% of treated subjects had a history of AIDS at study entry. Overall, 71% of subjects had been 
on treatment for HIV-1 infection for >15 years (randomised cohort: 67%, non-randomised cohort: 81%) 
and  84%  of  subjects  had  HIV-1  subtype  B  (randomised  cohort:  79%,  non-randomised  cohort:  97%) 
(Table 12).

Nearly  all  subjects  in  each  cohort  were  NRTI,  NNRTI  and  PI  experienced.  Drugs  from  classes  least 
frequently contained in prior regimens pertained to CCR5-, entry and integrase inhibitors.  
Overall, the study population of study 205888 consisted of ARV-experienced patients with long-standing 
disease and treatment histories.

Numbers analysed 
No randomised subjects were excluded from the ITT-E or safety population. A total of 48 subjects were 
excluded from the Per Protocol (PP) population. Reasons for exclusion from the PP population were study 
treatment non-compliance by subject (21), inclusion criteria (17), missing endpoint assessment (10), 
exclusion criteria (5) and randomisation procedure (2).  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint analysis, based on the adjusted mean decline in HIV-1 RNA from Day 1 at Day 8 
in the Randomised Cohort, demonstrated superiority of fostemsavir to placebo (0.79 vs. 0.17 log10 
decline, respectively; p<0.0001, Intent To Treat-Exposed [ITT-E] population) (Table 13).

d.    Two subjects (both in the fostemsavir arm) who had missing Day 1 HIV-1 RNA values were not included in the 
analysis.  
At Day 8, 65% (131/203) and 46% (93/203) of subjects had a reduction in viral load from baseline > 
0.5 log10 c/mL and > 1 log10 c/mL, respectively, in the fostemsavir group, compared with 19% (13/69) 
and 10% (7/69) of subjects, respectively, in the placebo group.  
By subgroup analysis, fostemsavir-treated Randomised subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA >1, 000 
c/mL achieved a median decline in viral load of 1.02 log10 c/mL at Day 8, compared with 0.00 log10 
c/mL decline in subjects treated with blinded placebo. 
Median change in HIV-1 RNA log10 c/mL from Day 1 to Day 8 of FTR functional monotherapy was 
similar in subjects with subtype B and non-B subtype virus (F1, BF1 and C). There was a reduced 
median response at Day 8 observed in subtypes A1 (n=2) and AE (n=1) but sample size was limited 
(Table 14).

viral load <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL was 75%, 70% and 64%, respectively (ITT-E, Snapshot

90 cells/mm3 at Week 24, 139 cells/mm3 at Week 48 and 205 cells/mm3 at Week 96). Based on a sub-
analysis in the Randomised Cohort, subjects with the lowest baseline CD4+ T-cell counts (<20 
cells/mm3) had a similar increase in CD4+ count over time compared with subjects with higher 
baseline CD4+ T-cell count (>50, >100, >200 cells/mm3).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Twelve patients ≥65 years of age (age group 65-74) were treated with FTR in the Phase 3 study 205888: 
10 in the randomised cohort and 2 in the non-randomised cohort. The proportion of elderly subjects who 
were  virologically  suppressed  at  Week  96  is  comparable  to  the  overall  results  (70%  (7/10)  vs  60%

(163/272) in the randomised cohort and 50% (1/2) vs 37% (37/100) in the non-randomised cohort). 
However, the generalisability of these results to the broader population is limited. 
The obligation to submit the results of studies with Rukobia in the paediatric population in HIV infection 
has been deferred. The efficacy of FTR in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not yet 
been established.  
Supportive study 
The Phase 2b study 205889 is considered supportive and provides long-term efficacy data of FTR over 
192 weeks in generally treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The mainstay of the efficacy data for FTR rests on two studies, the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study 205888 
and  the  Phase  2b  study  205889.  However,  these  studies  were  conducted  in  two  different  patient 
populations with two different ER formulations of FTR and different dosing regimens, thus rendering the 
efficacy assessment more difficult. 
The  ongoing  Phase  3  study  is  a  short-term  controlled,  two-cohort  study  in  HIV-1  infected  HTE  adult 
patients who are no longer able to form a viable ARV regimen due to resistance, intolerance or safety 
considerations. Patients were assigned to the randomised cohort or non-randomised cohort based on the 
number of fully active ARV agents that could be used to construct a background regimen. The design of 
the  Phase  3  study  was  discussed  during  a  scientific  advice  procedure  (EMEA/H/SA/544732/2014). 
However, the advice given by CHMP, e.g. regarding the study population and the inclusion criteria was 
not followed by the applicant. Subjects included in the randomised cohort had at least one fully active 
ARV  in  ≤2  ARV  classes  which  could  be  combined  with  FTR,  whereas  subjects  in  the  non-randomised 
cohort had zero remaining fully active ARVs at Screening. Of note, subjects in both cohorts could have 
partially active substances in their initial OBT which may have contributed to the overall efficacy. In the 
randomised  cohort,  62%  of  subjects  used  2  or  3  ARVs  in  their  initial  OBT  while  a  similar  proportion 
(62%) of non-randomised  cohort patients used 4-5 ARVs in their initial OBT. Non-efficacy related OBT 
changes (e.g. due drug intolerance/adverse events or sourcing issues) were allowed during the whole 
study duration, while OBT changes due to lack of efficacy were excluded from the analysis. However, 
most  subjects  in  both  cohorts  did  not  have  any  change  in  OBT  by  Week  96  (88%  in  the  randomised 
cohort and 76% in the non-randomised cohort). 
The study consisted of a short-term placebo-controlled functional monotherapy phase over 8 days in the 
randomised  cohort  and  an  open-label  phase  for  at  least  96  weeks  in  both  cohorts.  The  design  of  the 
study can be considered adequate to show an early, short-term effect of FTR functional monotherapy on 
plasma HIV-RNA concentrations, but the study was not designed to determine a long-term effect of FTR 
over OBT alone. A comparator arm with patients receiving active OBT without FTR was lacking and the 
variety of OBTs in both cohorts rendered it difficult to estimate the contribution of FTR on the overall 
efficacy (viral load and CD4+ T-cell count). 
Patients  included  in  the  phase  3  study  were  extensively  antiretroviral  therapy-experienced  and  thus 
reflect  the  intended  population  with  limited  remaining  treatment  options.  In  the  Phase  2b  study, 
participants’ viruses had to have a TMR IC50<0.1 µM, a virologic cut-off indicative of better response. No 
such restriction was applied to the Phase 3 study. However, 87.5% of the participants nevertheless met 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 63/85 
 
  
 
 
this criterion. 84% of patients included in the Phase 3 study were infected with HIV-1 subtype B; efficacy 
data for some subtypes were scarce or missing. The CHMP considered that it is currently not possible to 
derive a specific guidance to reliably identify patients most and least likely to respond to FTR. 
There were four amendments to the original protocol of study 205888 that applied to all study centres. 
The statistical methods, study duration and interim analyses have been amended several times. These 
fundamental  changes  in  the  protocol-specified  statistical  analysis  were  implemented  prior  to  the  first 
interim analysis (Week 24) and thus considered acceptable. Interim analyses were based on snapshots 
of the database which were subject to subsequent change (i.e. datasets were not locked for analyses) 
and consequently, the results slightly differed between the respective reports (Week 24, Week 48 and 
Week 96 report). Not locking the datasets for interim analysis is generally not acceptable, as changes 
subsequent  to  unblinding  and  analysis  may  be  impacted  by  results  and  introduce  bias.  However,  the 
CHMP concluded that this issue did not affect the validity of the primary endpoint results, as laboratory 
values upon which the primary and most secondary endpoints were based were not changed. The primary 
endpoint results were identical regardless of the snapshot (Week 24, 48 or 96) used and the results for 
virologic response were not relevantly impacted.  
A  high  number  of  subjects  was  enrolled  in  the  randomised  cohort  as  a  result  of  anticipating  a  long 
recruitment time, due to the level of rigor in the inclusion criteria and initiating a high number of centres 
worldwide. Hence, during the planned enrollment period, more subjects were recruited than anticipated. 
This CHMP considered that this did not affect validity of results.  
With regards to the conduct of the study and the GCP inspection conducted, the CHMP concluded that 
the protocol deviation evaluation did not exert a meaningful impact on the ITT or PP population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
During  the  8-day  functional  monotherapy  phase  of  study  205888,  subjects  of  the  randomised  cohort 
received either 600 mg FTR or placebo BID together with their current failing ARV regimen. The mean 
change in HIV-1 RNA log10 (copies/ml) from Day 1 to Day 8 was the primary endpoint of the study and 
statistical superiority to placebo was shown in both the ITT-E (difference of -0.625, p <0.0001) and PP 
population  (difference  of  -0.633,  p  <0.0001).  However,  the  antiviral  activity  of  FTR  was  considered 
weaker when comparing the change in viral load in the FTR group with the results of similar studies with 
other ARVs. 
A more pronounced decrease in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA was observed for FTR in the monotherapy phase 
of  the  2a  and  2b  trials,  but  these  studies  were  conducted  in  different  patient  populations  (ART-naïve 
patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B or generally treatment-experienced patients with IC50 <0.1 µM, 
respectively), with different regimens and using a different FTR ER formulation.  
The long-term antiviral effect was investigated in both cohorts in an uncontrolled manner over 96 weeks 
using the FDA snapshot algorithm in which subjects without an HIV-1 RNA value at the relevant time 
point or those who changed OBT due to lack of efficacy up to each time point were counted as failures. 
The virologic response in the randomised cohort increased from Week 24 to Week 96 (from 144 subjects 
(53%) with HIV-RNA <40 copies/ml at Week 24 to 163 subjects (60%) at Week 96) despite an increase 
in the number of subjects discontinuing and an increase in number of subjects who had changes in OBT. 
Interestingly, the success rate among randomised subjects with 1 fully active and available ARV in their 
initial OBT vs subjects with 2 ARV drugs in their initial OBT was comparable. However, it must be kept 
in mind that patients in the randomised cohort could additionally have partially active ARVs in their OBTs 
which may have contributed to the overall efficacy observed.  
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 64/85 
 
  
 
 
Generally, the presence of an INSTI in the initial OBT seemed to have a positive impact on the virologic 
response  for  randomised  subjects,  with  64%  having  <40  copies/ml  at  Week  96.  This  effect  may  be 
primarily due to dolutegravir since most subjects (229/239; 96%) taking an INSTI in their initial OBT 
were taking dolutegravir.  
In  the  non-randomised  cohort,  the  number  of  patients  with  HIV-RNA  <40  copies/ml  remained  stable 
over time and was considerably lower compared to patients in the randomised cohort at Week 96 (37% 
vs 60%). Subjects in the non-randomised cohort benefitted most from the presence of ibalizumab in the 
initial OBT which may have had a positive impact on virologic response through Week 48. 
Subgroup analyses by demographic characteristics (gender, age, race, geographic location) revealed no 
significant  differences.  However,  in  some  subgroups  the  number  of  subjects  was  small,  limiting  the 
generalisability of the results to the broader population. 
Generally, the virologic response rate seemed to be associated with the baseline disease characteristics. 
The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/ml over time was lower among subjects with a 
high baseline viral load (≥100,000 copies/ml) or a low baseline CD4+ T-cell count (<20 cells/mm3).  
The  supportive  phase  2b  study  205889  was  a  randomised,  active-controlled,  blinded-to-FTR,  multi-
centre trial in 251 generally treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients with TMR IC50 <0.1 µM. Four different 
FTR dosing regimens (400 mg BID, 800 mg BID, 600 mg QD and 1200 mg QD) were investigated in 
combination with 400 mg RAL BID and 300 mg TDF QD and compared to ATV/r as reference. Of note, 
the  combination  of  RAL  and  TDF  by  itself  can  be  anticipated  to  have  a  strong  antiviral  activity  in  the 
studied population. In recent studies (Gemini studies) with DTG +3TC, a “stronger” INSTI combined with 
a “weaker” NRTI have been shown to lead to very high rates of virologic suppression in patients with 
virus not harbouring resistance to INSTI or lamivudine. Therefore, sensitivity of this study for enabling 
the detection of an antiviral effect of FTR may be questioned. After the Week 48 analysis, all subjects 
randomised to 1 of the 4 FTR treatment groups were switched to the chosen continuation dose of 1200 
mg FTR QD over time (from Week 64 to Week 110) which they received as open label therapy along 
with the continued background regimen of RAL and TDF until Week 192. The primary endpoint was the 
number  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <50  copies/ml  at  Week  24,  which  is  a  widely  used  and 
accepted  endpoint  in  studies  investigating  HIV  antiretroviral  therapy.  At  this  timepoint,  the  virologic 
response was similar across all 4 FTR treatment groups (70-80%) and comparable with the response in 
the reference group (75%). At Week 48, the highest response rate was seen in the 400 mg BID group 
(82%). The 1200 mg QD FTR dose was chosen as continuation dose based on graphical exploration of 
the E-R-relationship from the monotherapy sub-study and the Phase 2a POC study (206267). 
Although it was not powered for a statistical comparison of response rates, study 205889 was in principle 
considered to provide controlled long-term data on antiviral activity of four different FTR doses for at 
least 48 weeks. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that despite some limitations as described above, the efficacy data 
support granting the marketing authorisation. The CHMP recommended that the final study data from 
the pivotal trial 205888 including the planned long-term follow up should be submitted once available.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety population was used for all safety analysis, which consists of all subjects who received at least 
one dose of FTR.  
A total of 1,465 subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of FTR or TMR across the entire clinical 
development  programme (624 HIV-1-infected adults and 841 uninfected adults) up to the data cut-off 
date  for  the  week  96  analysis  of  the  Phase  3  study  205888  (14-Aug-2018).  This  total  comprises  the 
following for the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies: 
•  370  HIV-1-infected  heavily  treatment-experienced  subjects  from  the  ongoing  Phase  3  study 
(205888) in heavily treatment-experienced subjects, all of whom were exposed to 1200 mg FTR 
daily (administered as FTR 600 mg BID)  
•  200  HIV-1-infected  treatment-experienced  subjects  from  the  completed  Phase  2b  study 
(205889), 183 of the 200 patients were exposed to ≥ 1200 mg FTR daily 
Furthermore  50  HIV-1-infected  treatment-naïve  and  treatment-experienced  subjects  in  the  Phase  2a 
(206267), were exposed to doses ranging from 1200 to 2400 mg FTR daily (with and without RTV, up 
to 200 mg) for up to 8 days. A total of 12 patients have been enrolled into the Early Access  Programme 
and 767 healthy subjects across the completed clinical pharmacology studies were exposed to FTR (693) 
and  TMR  (66)  and  FTR/TMR  (8).  74  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment,  renal  impairment,  or  opioid 
dependency received FTR.  
The  median  exposure  time  for  the  96  weeks  analysis  of  the  Phase  3  study  was  113  weeks  for  the 
randomised and 108 weeks for the non-randomised cohort. A median exposure time of 176 weeks was 
reported for patients of the Phase 2b study receiving ≥ 1200 mg FTR daily.  
The exposure time for FTR of the Phase 2b and Phase 3 study is in line with recommendations of the 
Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection.  
Adverse events 
The most common AEs reported in ≥5% subjects of the randomised and non-randomised cohort of the 
Phase  3  study  and  the  Phase  2b  study  (FTR  total)  were:  diarrhoea,  nausea,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, influenza, bronchitis, pyrexia and vomiting (table 18). The 
safety data through Week 144 did not change significantly in type or frequency compared to Week 96.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
The  most  common  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  SOCs  “Infections  and  infestations”,  “Neoplasms”  and 
“Gastrointestinal disorders”. The most commonly reported SAEs by preferred term for >=2 Subjects (in 
the randomised, non-randomised and Phase 2b study, respectively) were: pneumonia (4%, 3%, 0%), 
cellulitis,  (2%,  3%,  <1%),  acute  kidney  injury  (<1%,  4%,  <1%),  diarrhoea (1%,  0%,  <1%),  sepsis 
(<1%, 3%, <1%), acute myocardial infarction (1%, 1%, 0%).  
Through Week 144, forty-three subjects reported 75 new SAEs during the period of review which brings 
the cumulative total reported during Phase 3 study to 374 SAEs in 158 (43%) subjects compared to 299 
SAEs in 140 (38%) subjects through Week 96. The following SAEs were reported in at least two subjects: 
pneumonia (n=5, cellulitis n=2, angina pectoris n=2, coronary artery disease n=2).  
Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events  
In the Phase 2b/ Phase 3 studies, drug-related SAEs occurred on a single patient level except for IRIS, 
and Nephrolithiasis, for which two patients reported drug-related SAEs. Acute kidney injury and renal 
impairment have been reported in the same patient.  
One single new SAE of supraventricular tachycardia (grade 3) possibly related to study treatment was 
reported in Phase 3 study through Week 144. No prolonged QTc interval was recorded. The event was 
successfully treated with adenosine and the SAE resolved without interruption in dosing of FTR.  
No drug-related SAEs were reported in the Phase 2a study. One patient in the Early Access Programme 
had had an SAE of rash (severe, Grade 3) coded as drug hypersensitivity, which was considered drug-
related.  The  subject  did  not  experience  any  respiratory  symptoms  or  other  symptoms  related  to  a 
possible anaphylactic reaction. Three subjects in the Phase1 studies had SAEs considered to be related 
to study drug: one case of atrioventricular block second degree, one anaphylactic reaction (Grade 2) and 
one case of headache. 
Deaths 
In total, 36 deaths have been reported under the FTR clinical development programme (35 on study and 
one during screening). The majority of these fatalities (29/36) occurred in the Phase 3 study (until Week 
96) with the most common causes of death in the Phase 3 study related to complications of AIDS and 
acute infection. 
Of the 36 deaths, one death (IRIS related to recurrent atypical mycobacterial infection) was considered 
related to study medication by the investigator.  
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 68/85 
 
  
 
 
 
Of the 29 deaths, 7 were AIDS related, 11 were acute infections, 6 were non-AIDS related malignancies 
and 5 were due to other conditions. Twenty-three (23) of the 29 deaths (79%) occurred in subjects with 
baseline CD4+ T-cell counts <50 cells/ mm3. The median baseline CD4+ T-cell counts for all subjects 
who died was 11 cells/mm3.  
Adverse events of special interest 
• 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome  
These  events  were  reported  at  the  same  rate  (2%)  within  the  randomised  and  non-randomised 
cohorts of the Phase 3 study. All but one of these AESIs were considered drug-related to FTR. Week 
144 data of the Phase 3 study did not identify new cases of IRIS. Overall, IRIS events are considered 
a  well  described  and  an  expected  risk  for  patients  with  advanced  HIV  disease  and  low  CD4+  cell 
counts. 
•  Hypersensitivity reaction and rash 
In general, AESIs related to hypersensitivity reaction were reported at similar rates (21%, 23% and 
23%) within the randomised, non-randomised cohorts of the Phase 3 study and the Phase 2b (FTR 
total); 3%, 3% and 4%, of these AESIs were considered drug-related to FTR. 
The majority of HSR-and rash-related events reported in the Phase 2b/ Phase 3 studies were non-
serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and resolved on continued treatment with FTR. Most subjects 
(71%) experienced a single event. 
•  QTc prolongation 
QTc-prolongation  was  reported  in  all  phases  of  the  clinical  development  programme,  with  few 
translating in adverse events. There were no fatal events related to cardiovascular reasons. AESIS 
related  to  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  occurred  in  4%,  1%  and  1%  in  the  randomised,  non-
randomised and Phase 2b study and few related to FTR (<1%, 1%, 0%). 
•  Musculoskeletal events and CPK elevation 
Similar  proportions  of  these  AESIs  and  CPK  elevation  are  reported  for  14%,  17%  and  17% 
respectively 3%, 3% and 5% of patients in the randomised and non-randomised cohort of the Phase 
3 studies and the Phase 2b study. CPK elevation was observed with similar rates. 
The majority of AEs were mild and unrelated. There was one SAE of Rhabdomyolysis SAE (Grade 4), 
which occurred in the Phase 3 study and was considered related to FTR. The treatment with FTR and 
OBT was stopped and the patient discontinued the study. 
•  Weight 
Patients in the randomised cohort of the Phase 3 study had a mean increase of weight (change from 
baseline) of 4.2 kg, patients in the non-randomised cohort, 2.5 kg at week 96. Similar rates were 
observed for the Phase 2b study (1,8-4,3 kg in the different FTR-arms) and 4,3 kg for the control 
group of the Phase b study. No clinically relevant trends or changes in weight were observed in the 
Phase 2a and the Phase 1.  
Laboratory findings 
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation 
Most CPK elevations in the Phase 2b/3 studies were low grade, transient, and resolved during continued 
treatment of FTR. Overall, a low proportion of subjects on FTR treatment experienced Grade 3 or 4 CPK 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 69/85 
 
  
 
 
elevations. At Week 144, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 3 CPK elevation remains low at 12/370 
(3%) of subjects. 
No  increases  in  CPK  were  report  in  the  Phase  2a  study.  Below  normal  range  treatment-emergent 
abnormalities  in  CPK  were  reported  in  10  subjects  (20%),  and  overall  there  was  a  small  decrease  in 
mean and median CPK during the study. Across the 27 Phase 1 studies, 2 post-baseline Grade 4 CPK 
elevations were reported (1 in a subject who had received FTR and 1 in a subject who received placebo 
only) and all other CPK elevations for 626 subjects with available grading data were Grade 1. 
Liver function 
Three subjects, all from the Phase 3 study, had a combination of ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN at 
any post-baseline visit. All subjects had underlying hepatic events. 
Hepatocellular injury was reported for 6%, 1% and 5% of patients in the randomised, non-randomised 
cohorts of the Phase 3 study and the Phase 2b study. One event of hepatocellular injury (Grade 4) was 
considered drug-related.  
A total of 5/553 (<1%) subjects, 4 from the Phase 3 study and one subject 1 from the Phase 2b Study 
had an ALT value ≥ 10xULN at any post-Baseline visit.  
In the Phase 2a study, treatment-emergent abnormalities above the normal range for AST and ALT were 
reported  in  5  (10%)  subjects  for  each  parameter.  Overall,  there  was  a  small  decrease  in  mean  and 
median ALT and AST during the study. No AEs related to any liver test laboratory abnormalities were 
reported. 
Across the 27 Phase1 studies, there were no cases of Grade 3 toxicity reported and only few events of 
Grade 1 (2%) and Grade 2 (<1%) toxicity.  
Direct Bilirubin 
In the Phase 3 study 205888, 38/367 (10%) subjects experienced a Grade 3 increase in direct bilirubin 
with no Grade 4 increases. Overall, emergent Grade 3 or Grade 4 total bilirubin elevation occurred in 11 
(3%) and 2 (<1%) subjects of the Phase 3 study.  
The applicant argues that majority of cases of Grade 3 elevations in direct bilirubin observed in the Phase 
3 study (9%) were confounded by serious liver AEs (not associated with the dosing of study medication), 
viral hepatitis co-infection, relevant medical history, or concomitant medications including ATV.  
Lipid parameters 
Using the LOCF method, the Phase 2b and 3 studies did not reveal any clinically relevant effect of FTR 
treatment  on  the  lipid  profile.  Grade  2-4  lipid-related  laboratory  abnormalities  were  recorded  for  a 
minority of subjects, with Grade 3-4 events reported for 5% or fewer subjects. This was reflected by 
small mean increases in total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and HDL. 
Total Cholesterol/HDL Ratio 
In the Phase 3 study, the change from baseline at Week 96 in total cholesterol/HDL ratio, was minimal. 
Lipid values were not analysed in the Phase 2a Study and the Phase 1 studies.  
Haematology 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 70/85 
 
  
 
 
 
 
There were no clinically relevant trends in post-baseline emergent haematology toxicities for the Phase 
2b/3 integrated analysis. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rare. Although the most commonly reported post-
baseline-emergent haematology abnormality was decreased haemoglobin, haemoglobin concentrations 
increased over time. 
The  most  frequently  observed  treatment-emergent  abnormalities  included  below  normal  range 
neutrophils (absolute and %) and above normal range monocytes (%). Other haematology abnormalities 
were observed in 10 (20%) subjects at most. No relevant differences between the regimen groups were 
observed, although the incidence of neutrophils (absolute count) below normal range was higher in the 
1200  mg  BID  FTR  group  (70%)  than  in  the  other  regimen  groups  (range  20  to  40%).  The  overall 
incidence  of  neutrophils  below  normal  was  38.8%.  No  AEs  related  to  any  haematology  laboratory 
abnormalities were reported. 
No trends in haematology changes were noted during the conduct of the Phase 1 studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender: Overall, 160 women were enrolled in the Phase 2b/Phase 3 studies, allowing for an adequate 
analysis of safety according to gender. Across all analysis groups, SAEs were more commonly reported 
in male subjects (33% vs 22% in the FTR Safety Cohort). The incidence of other categories of AEs (e.g., 
AEs related to study treatment, AEs leading to discontinuation) was similar between males and females. 
Age: The majority of subjects across the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies were <65 years of age. Only 14 
(2%) subjects on FTR across these 2 studies were 65 years of age or older. For the FTR Safety Cohort, 
older  subjects  (≥  50  years  of  age)  generally  experienced  higher  rates  of  events  (regardless  of  AE 
category);  in  particular,  AEs  leading  to  permanent discontinuation of  study  treatment  and  SAEs  were 
more commonly reported in subjects ≥50 years.  
Race:  The  proportions  of  African  Americans/  Hispanic  Americans  and  White  subjects  across  the  two 
studies were 26% and 58% respectively. Other racial groups represented 16% of the total population. 
It should be noted that the percentages of subjects reported as African Americans/ Hispanic Americans 
and White differed substantially between the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies. A higher proportion of White 
subjects  were  enrolled  in  Phase  3  study  (70%)  compared  with  Phase  2b  (36%).  Across  the  analysis 
groups, AEs related to study treatment were more commonly reported in White subjects than African 
Americans/ Hispanic Americans subjects (37% vs 24%, respectively, in the FTR Safety Cohort).  
Hepatitis and/ or Hepatitis Virus Co-Infection  
No special study was performed for Hepatitis B (HBV) and/or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infected patients, 
but HCV patients and HBV (chronically and treated) patients were allowed to enter the Phase 3 study 
(except for patients with a history of decompensated cirrhosis or active decompensated cirrhosis).  
The number of HBV and/ or HCV co-infected patients was limited (14 HBV, 14 HCV and 1 HBV/HCV co-
infected patients). These patients had higher Grades of AST, ALT and total bilirubin as compared to the 
patients without HBV and HCV infection. The effect of FTR in these patient populations is not assessable, 
based  on  the  limitations  of  the  study  design  of  the  Phase  3  study  and  due  to  the  limited  number  of 
patients.  
Hepatic impairment 
The Phase 1 Study 206280 assessed PK and Safety of FTR in hepatic impairment subjects mild [Child-
Pugh class A], moderate [Child-Pugh Class B], and severe [Child-Pugh class C].  
EMA/702367/2020

There  were  no  deaths,  SAEs,  Grade  3-4  AEs,  or  discontinuations  due  to  an  AE  during  the  treatment 
period. Overall, 9 (30.0%) subjects experienced AEs during the study. The most frequently reported AE 
was headache, occurring in 6 (20.0%) subjects. AE incidence did not appear to be associated with degree 
of hepatic impairment. All reported AEs were mild in intensity. No clinically relevant treatment-emergent 
abnormalities occurred in clinical laboratory results, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examinations. 
Renal Impairment 
The Phase 1 Study 206217 assessed PK and safety of FTR in subjects with normal renal function and 
subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and ESRD.  
There  were  no  deaths  during  this  study.  There  was  no  trend  in  AE  incidence  with  worsening  renal 
function.  Several  subjects  (predominantly  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  ESRD)  had  marked 
fluctuations  in  blood  urea  nitrogen  levels  to  above  normal  range.  There  were  no  trends  in  serum 
creatinine level changes in any treatment group. Treatment-emergent abnormalities in other laboratory 
parameters were rare. No significant changes in vital signs or ECGs were observed during the study.  
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from enrolling in FTR clinical studies, and no studies have 
been conducted with FTR in this population. Eight pregnancies were reported in subjects who received 
FTR,  and  1  pregnancy  was  reported  in  a  partner  of  a  male  subject  who  received  FTR.  Five  of  these 
pregnancies resulted in live birth, 3 resulted in induced abortion and 1 ended in spontaneous abortion. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ten  Drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  studies  were  performed  in  healthy  subjects.  Relevant  safety  signals 
were observed in the Phase 1 study (206282) (DDI study with FTR/RTV and Rifabutin), which reported 
70% of drug-related AEs and a 20% discontinuation rate due to AEs. Increase of total bilirubin and ocular 
icterus was detected when FTR was given with ATV/RTV.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  total,  several  patients discontinued  the  study  due  to  AEs:  5%,  12%  and  4%  were  reported  in  the 
randomised, non-randomised cohorts of the Phase 3 study (until Week 96) and Phase 2b study. Most of 
these AEs occurred in the SOC infections and infestations (2%, 5%, 2%). 
In the Phase 3 study Week 144 analysis, three cases with new reports of AEs leading to withdrawal were 
described:  one  patient  with  an  SAE  of  severe  Grade  3  major  depression;  one  patient  with  an  SAE  of 
Grade 3 cytomegaloviral pneumonia and one patient with a non-serious AE of obstructive arteriopathy. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For  establishing  the  safety  profile  of  FTR,  the  applicant  has  undertaken  one  Phase  3  study  205888 
(BRIGHTE),  one  Phase  2b  study  205889,  one  Phase  2a  study  206267  and  27  Phase  pharmacological 
studies, giving rise to a total of 1,465 patients, who have been exposed to at least 1 dose of FTR or TMR 
(data cut-off date 14-Aug-2018). 
The randomised cohort of the Phase 3 study comprised 271 patients. This cohort was the primary safety 
database  for  FTR,  as  it  represents  the  only  study,  which  enrolled  patients  according  to  the  proposed 
label,  namely  patients  with  multi  drug  resistant  HIV-1,  who  were  able  to  receive  1  to  2  fully-active 
approved ARVs as part of their OBT and with the intended dose of FTR 600 mg BID. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 72/85 
 
  
 
 
The following study data were used as supportive evidence (the main differences from the randomised 
cohort  of  the  Phase  3  study  are  outlined  in  brackets):  non-randomised  cohort  of  the  Phase  3  study 
(patients had no fully active and approved ARV in their OBT), the Phase 2b study (not MDR-HIV patients, 
different dosages and formulation as compared to Phase 3), the Phase 2a (not MDR-HIV, only an eight-
day time frame), the Early Access  Programme (few patients) and the pharmacological studies (different 
formulations and short-term safety). 
The CHMP considered that the assessment of the safety profile of FTR in the Phase 3 study was limited 
by the lack of comparative data, the severity of the underlying disease and the individualised OBT. For 
a better understanding of the safety profile of FTR, the applicant provided comparative data from the 8-
days blinded period of the Phase 3 random cohort (FTR vs. placebo) as well as from the Phase 2b study 
(FTR group ≥1200 mg vs. control group). Furthermore, a comparison of safety data between FTR Phase 
3 study and published studies conducted in the MDR-HIV indication with comparable patient population 
has  been  provided  by  the  applicant  (studies  investigating  ibalizumab,  dolutegravir,  maraviroc  and 
enfuvirtide) and it did not identify a safety concern.  
The safety assessment was mainly based on the 96 weeks analysis of the ongoing Phase 3 study (cut-
off date 14-Aug-2018) and end of study analysis of the completed Phase 2b study.  
While similar proportions of subjects were reported for any AEs for the Phase 3 and Phase 2b studies 
(92%,  99%,  93%)  and  for  drug-related  AEs  (any  Grade),  with  increasing  severity  of  the  AEs,  the 
imbalance between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 became more apparent: a greater portion of patients in the 
randomised Phase 3 cohort had SAEs, fatal SAEs and Grade 3, Grade 4 AEs, as compared to the Phase 
2b study, with the highest rates for the non-randomised cohort. As patients in the Phase 3 study had a 
more  advanced  HIV  disease  at  baseline  (e.g.  less  CD4+  Cells)  compared  to  the  Phase  2b  study,  the 
observation that patients in the Phase 3 study reported higher rates of AEs of increased severity was 
considered expected.  
ADRs (any Grade) were reported in 38%, 34%, 34% in the randomised cohort and the non-randomised 
cohort of the Phase 3 study, and in the Phase 2b study, respectively. For the randomised cohort of the 
Phase 3 study, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs (any Grade) ≥1% were nausea (10%), 
diarrhoea (4%), headache (4%), dyspepsia (3%), fatigue (2%), insomnia (2%), depression (2%), IRIS 
(2%), blood creatinine increased (2%), abdominal pain (1%), rash (1%) and ECG QT prolonged (<1%).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study treatment  were  reported  for  5%,  12%,  4%  of  subjects in the 
randomised and non-randomised Phase 3 cohorts and in the Phase 2b study, respectively, which is in 
line with discontinuation rates in clinical studies with HIV patients.  
Updated tables and analyses considering Week 144 data from Phase 3 study (cut-off date 06-September-
2019)  have  been  provided  by  the  applicant.  Overall,  no  significant  changes  in  rates  or  severity  of 
reported AEs were detected and no new safety signals were identified. 
Comparative data from the 8-days blinded period of the Phase 3 random cohort (FTR vs. placebo) and 
from the Phase 2b study (FTR group ≥1200 mg vs. control group) did not identify new safety signals. 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome, Hypersensitivity reaction and Rash, Musculoskeletal 
events and CPK elevation, and QTc-prolongation were identified as adverse reactions of special interest 
and reflected in the Product Information. 
Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is considered as a potential serious consequence of the QTc-prolongation. 
To date, there are not enough data to completely rule out the risk of clinically relevant consequences of 
QTc  prolongation,  especially  as  some  important  aspects  are  still  missing  in  the  studies  due  to  the 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 73/85 
 
  
 
 
exclusion of special co-medications and comorbidities. Therefore, the CHMP considered that ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias  due  to QTc  prolongation  should  be  addressed  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  potential 
risk. 
The lack of long-term safety data has been addressed in the RMP as missing information. This was to 
take into account that until now, analysed data are only available from Phase 3 study up to week 144, 
whereby patients are expected to take this medicine for their whole life. With regards to pregnancy, 
the available study data is considered limited to draw any conclusion on the use of FTR during 
pregnancy and lactating. The CHMP considered that these data will be collected as part of the 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, as outlined in the RMP.  
Total and direct bilirubin elevations have been observed for patients treated with FTR. Analysis presented 
by the applicant did not identify an increased risk caused by FTR. However, cases with elevations in total 
and direct bilirubin should be closely monitored and discussed in the upcoming PSURs. 
Weight increase for patients treated with FTR was observed throughout the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies. 
The potential of long-term risk of weight gain should be discussed in the upcoming PSURs. 
Two  phase  1  studies  in  renally  impaired  and  hepatically  impaired  patients  were  conducted,  without 
identifying any additional safety signals. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that despite some limitations and uncertainties of the safety database as 
discussed above, no serious safety risks emerged, and a favourable safety profile has been 
established. Routine pharmacovigilance will be utilised to further characterize the safety of fostemsavir 
post-authorisation.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of fostemsavir with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers fostemsavir to be a new active substance as it is not 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 76/85 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rukobia (fostemsavir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Since the beginning of the epidemic, 75 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 
32 million people have died of AIDS. Globally, 37.9 million [32.7–44.0 million] people were living with 
HIV at the end of 2018. An estimated 0.8% [0.6-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living 
with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and 
regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (3.9%) 
living with HIV and accounting for more than two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide. 
HIV-1 accounts for around 95% of all infections worldwide. The strains of HIV-1 can be classified into 
four groups of which M is responsible for the majority of the global HIV epidemic. The other three groups 
-  N,  O  and  P  -  are  quite  uncommon.  Group  O  represents  up  to  5%  of  infections  in  several  west  and 
central African countries, and Group N and P have been rarely identified in Cameroon.  
Within group  M  there  are known  to  be  at  least nine  genetically  distinct  subtypes  of  HIV-1.  These  are 
subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K. Additionally, different subtypes can combine genetic material to 
form a hybrid virus and around 89 of these are known to exist.  
The dominant HIV subtype in the EU and North America is subtype B. As a result, the great majority of 
HIV  clinical  research  has  been  conducted  in  populations  where  subtype  B  predominates,  despite  this 
subtype representing only 12% of global HIV infections. Nearly 50% of all people living with HIV have 
subtype C. It is very common in the high prevalence countries of Africa and India.  
There is usually no clinical presentation of HIV-1 infection until such time as an undiagnosed, and thus 
untreated case, has progressed to develop one or more of the conditions that would classify them as 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 77/85 
 
  
 
 
having  AIDS.  Thus,  diagnosis  is  usually  based  on  presentation  of  individuals  for  routine  screening  or 
referral of contacts of known cases. The diagnosis is based on a combination of serological and virologic 
laboratory tests.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of HIV involves life-long therapy with combinations of ARVs. Currently, there are many 
agents  approved  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection  belonging  to  the  following  classes:  Nucleoside-
Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors  (NRTI),  Non-Nucleoside  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors  (NNRTI), 
Protease  Inhibitors  (PI),  Entry  Inhibitors  (co-receptor  antagonist  and  fusion  inhibitor)  and  Integrase 
Strand  Transfer  Inhibitors  (INSTI).  The  ability  to  co-formulate  any  of  these  ARVs  as  fixed-dose 
combinations have greatly advanced HIV treatment by allowing simplification of dosing and reduction 
of pill burden. 
Despite  the  availability  of  these  different  classes  of  ARV  agents  in  providing  a  variety  of  treatment 
options, treatment failure continues to occur as a result of ARV drug resistance, drug-associated toxicity 
and tolerability problems, and poor adherence. Treatment failure may result in selection of virus with 
resistance to one or more ARV agents within a combination regimen. Furthermore, resistance mutations 
selected  by  one  ARV  agent  often  confer  resistance  to  multiple  drugs  within  a  given  ARV  class, 
significantly  limiting  future  therapeutic  options.  Later-line  regimens  often  lack  the  convenience  and 
tolerability of first-line drugs, which in-turn may exacerbate non-adherence. Thus, there is an ongoing 
need for new classes of ARV drugs capable of providing potent, durable antiviral activity against current 
ARV-resistant viruses. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
As an orally available antiretroviral agent of a new class, the current CHMP guidance would recommend 
that FTR should be studied initially in ART-naïve patients, with careful documentation of early and longer-
term virologic response and the risk of selecting for resistance. This was advised in a CHMP scientific 
advice.  However,  the  sponsor  chose  not  to  follow  CHMP  guidance  and  agreed  a  clinical  development 
programme with FDA. 
Study 205888 (BRIGHTE) 
The pivotal ongoing phase 3 study 205888 was a multi-centre, short-term controlled, two-cohort study 
in heavily treatment-experienced adult subjects who are no longer able to form a viable ARV regimen 
due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations. Patients were assigned to the randomised cohort 
or non-randomised cohort based on the number of fully active ARV agents that could be used to construct 
a background regimen. Subjects included in the randomised cohort had at least one fully active ARV in 
≤2 ARV classes which could be combined with FTR, whereas subjects in the non-randomised cohort had 
zero remaining fully active ARVs at screening. The study consisted of a short-term placebo-controlled 
functional monotherapy phase over 8 days in the randomised cohort and an open-label phase for at least 
96  weeks  in  both  cohorts.  The  study  protocol  did  not  specify  how  many  partly  active  drugs  may  be 
available and used for the construction of the OBT and changes in OBT were allowed during the whole 
study duration. 
Study 205889 
The phase 2b study 205889 was a randomised, active-controlled, blinded-to-FTR, multi-centre trial in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients. Subjects were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to 400 mg FTR BID, 800 
mg FTR BID, 600 mg FTR QD, 1200 mg FTR QD or a control regimen containing atazanavir boosted with 
ritonavir  (ATV/r).  Each  treatment  group  received  raltegravir  400  mg  BID  plus  tenofovir  disoproxil 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 78/85 
 
  
 
 
fumarate 300 mg QD as the backbone. The study consisted of an elective 7-day monotherapy substudy 
with a subset of subjects (~10 subjects per FTR treatment group) and a primary study over 192 weeks. 
After the Week 48 analysis, all subjects randomised to 1 of the 4 FTR treatment groups were switched 
to the chosen continuation dose of 1200 mg FTR QD over time (from Week 64 to Week 110) which they 
received as open label therapy along with the continued background regimen of raltegravir and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
During  the  8-day  functional  monotherapy  phase  of  study  205888,  subjects  of  the  randomised  cohort 
received either 600 mg FTR or placebo BID together with their current failing ARV regimen. The mean 
change in HIV-1 RNA log10 (copies/ml) from Day 1 to Day 8 was the primary endpoint of the study and 
statistical superiority to placebo was shown in both the ITT-E (difference of -0.625, p <0.0001) and PP 
population  (difference  of  -0.633,  p  <0.0001).  No  meaningful  differences  were  observed  based  on 
demographic characteristics. 
The  long-term  antiviral  effect  was  investigated  in  both  cohorts  of  study  205888  in  an  uncontrolled 
manner over 96 weeks using the FDA snapshot algorithm, in which subjects without an HIV-1 RNA value 
at the relevant time point or those who changed OBT due to lack of efficacy up to each time point were 
counted as failures. The virologic response in the randomised cohort increased from Week 24 to Week 
96 from 144 subjects (53%) with HIV-RNA <40 copies/ml at Week 24 to 163 subjects (60%) at Week 
96 (despite an increase in the number of subjects discontinuing and an increase in number of subjects 
who had changes in OBT). The number of patients with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/ml in the non-randomised 
cohort remained stable over time with 37 subjects (37%).  
In the Phase 2b study, long-term efficacy of 4 different FTR dosing regimens was shown over 48 weeks. 
At Week 24 (primary endpoint), the virologic response was similar across all 4 FTR treatment groups 
(70-80%) and comparable with the response in the reference group (75%). At Week 48, the highest 
response rate was seen in the 400 mg BID group (82%). From Week 64 to Week 110, all subjects were 
switched to the continuation dose of 1200 mg FTR QD and at Week 192, 53% of subjects taking FTR 
were virologically suppressed compared to 43% in the control arm. 
The CD4+ T-cell count increased in both studies over time. In the Phase 2b study 205889, the mean 
change  from  baseline  at  Week  192  was  279.9  cells/mm3  compared  to  263.7  cells/mm3 in  the  control 
arm, while in the Phase 3 study 205888, the mean change from baseline at Week 96 was 204.7 cells/mm3 
in the randomised cohort and 119.1 cells/mm3 in the non-randomised cohort. 
A  relevant  difference  between  FTR  and  the  recently  approved  monoclonal  antibody  ibalizumab 
(Trogarzo), both targeting the same patient population, is the method of administration. Ibalizumab is 
administered  every  two  weeks  by  infusion,  with  the  need  for  regular  visits to  the health  care  facility, 
while FTR can be administered orally twice daily.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The design of the Phase 3 study 205888 can be considered adequate to show an early, short-term effect 
of FTR functional monotherapy on plasma HIV-RNA concentrations, but the study was not designed to 
determine the long-term efficacy of FTR over OBT alone. A comparator arm with patients receiving active 
OBT  without  FTR  is  lacking  and  the  variety  of  OBTs  at  baseline  rendered  it  difficult  to  estimate  the 
contribution of FTR on the overall efficacy (viral load and CD4+ T-cell count).  
The Phase 2b study was not powered for statistical analyses and no comparisons were planned. Thus, 
no conclusions on non-inferiority were possible. 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 79/85 
 
  
 
 
Patients  included  in  the  Phase  3  study  were  extensively  antiretroviral  therapy-experienced  and  thus 
reflect  the  intended  population  with  limited  remaining  treatment  options.  In  the  Phase  2b  study, 
participants’ virus had to have a TMR IC50<0.1 µM, a virological cut-off indicative of better response. No 
such restriction was applied for the Phase 3 study; however, 87.5% of the participants nevertheless met 
this criterion. Moreover, most subjects included in the two studies were infected with HIV-1 subtype B 
(study 205888: 84%, study 205889: 66%) and efficacy data for some subtypes were limited. In vitro 
data  indicated  a  considerable  variability  in  susceptibility  to  TMR  for  the  HIV-1  subtypes  investigated, 
which  in  addition  was  accompanied  by  substantial  intra-subject  variability.  Furthermore,  the  antiviral 
activity  was  reduced  in  subtype  CRF_01  AE  and  AG,  and  in  Group  O  and  N  viruses  due  to  genotypic 
group-related natural resistance. 
In the Phase 2b study 205889, antiviral activity of a FTR was seen in a 7-day monotherapy study. In 
combination with raltegravir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the four different FTR dosing regimens 
showed numerically comparable efficacy for at least 48 weeks in HIV-1 patients with TMR IC50 <0.1 µM. 
These findings may indicate that the strong background regimen does not allow to show any additional 
effect of FTR and/or that the TMR IC50 may be more important than the actual FTR dose. 
The  antiviral  activity  of  FTR  in  the  8-day  functional  monotherapy  phase  of  the  study  205888  was 
considered weak when comparing the change in viral load in the FTR group with results of similar studies 
with other ARVs. Moreover, due to the wide variety of background regimens among subjects included in 
both cohorts (fully active + partially active substances) and the lacking control group, it was difficult to 
disentangle the contribution of FTR to the overall long-term efficacy. Generally, the presence of an INSTI, 
particularly DTG, in the randomised cohort seemed to have a positive impact on the virologic response. 
However, the recent change in treatment guidelines (after this study was conducted), recommending 
INSTIs, particularly DTG as first-line treatment (and given its wider availability) raised the question of 
the efficacy of FTR in a true last-line ARV-therapy setting, e.g. a situation, where the most potent drugs 
have been exhausted, when initiating FTR.  
The large variability in susceptibility to TMR that was seen across clinical trials and in vitro, preclude a 
conclusion, which patient population will benefit most from treatment with FTR. Generally, presence of 
key  resistance  substitutions  in  the  gp160  domain  was  correlated  with  greatly  decreased  TMR 
susceptibility in vitro and subsequent clinical response to treatment, although with exceptions. Different 
HIV-1  subtypes  exhibited  a  wide  range  of  susceptibility  to  TMR,  which  in  addition  is  accompanied  by 
substantial intra-subject variability, indicating that response and susceptibility to TMR in the presence of 
envelopes containing signature changes seem to be context-dependent. 
Treatment-emergent genotypic substitutions in gp160 at one or more of the four positions of interest 
were seen frequently across the clinical trials and may be a cause of concern. FTR appears to have a low 
barrier  to  selection  of  virus  with  substitutions  associated  with  reduced  susceptibility  as  well  as  for 
selection  of  virus  with  increased  TMR  IC50  in  the  absence  of  gp160  substitutions  at  the  applicant’s 
identified positions of interest. It was not always clear why some patients experienced virologic failure 
to  FTR  regimen.  This  raised  concerns  that  there  may  be  other  baseline  polymorphisms  or  sequence 
contexts that affect response to FTR (in addition to the four key sites that were examined in the studies).  
The data submitted indicated that relative to other antiretroviral drugs, FTR may have a lower barrier to 
resistance, potentially impacting also the activity of the other agents in the combination regimen and 
thus increasing the risk of treatment emergent changes in susceptibility to the OBT. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For  establishing  the  safety  profile  of  FTR,  the  applicant  has  undertaken  one  Phase  3  study  (205888 
BRIGHTE) – a two cohort study conducted in HIV-1-infected heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adult 
EMA/702367/2020  
Page 80/85 
 
  
 
 
subjects infected with MDR HIV-1 and one Phase 2b study (205889) randomised, FTR-blinded Phase 2b 
study in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects. Furthermore, one Early Access Programme, a 
Phase 2a study in HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects and 27 Phase 1 
studies were performed. 
The randomised cohort of an ongoing Phase 3 study 205888 (BRIGHTE) enrolled patients with MDR-HIV, 
who were able to receive 1 to 2 fully active approved ARVs as part of their optimised background therapy. 
The  MDR-HIV  patients  received  the  intended  dose  (FTR  600  mg  BID  dosing) and  the  to-be-marketed 
formulation. 
The primary safety database for FTR (N=271 patients) relies on the randomised cohort of the ongoing 
Phase 3 study 205888, as it represents the only study, which enrolled patients according to the proposed 
label, i.e. patients with multi drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 and with the intended dose (FTR 600 mg BID). 
Furthermore,  safety  data  from  Phase  2b  study  (205889),  Phase  2a  study  206267,  Early  Access 
Programme (207214) and the Phase 1 studies were considered for safety analysis.  
A total of 1,465 subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of FTR or TMR across the entire clinical 
development programme (624 HIV-1-infected adults and 841 uninfected adults) up to the data cut-off 
date for the week 96 analysis of the Phase 3 study 205888 (14-Aug-2018). This comprised the following 
figures for the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies: 
•  370  HIV-1-infected  heavily  treatment-experienced  subjects  from  the  ongoing  Phase  3  study 
(205888), all of whom were exposed to 1200 mg FTR daily (administered as FTR 600 mg BID) 
(N=271 in the randomised cohort and N=99 in the non-randomised cohort); 
•  200  HIV-1-infected  treatment-experienced  subjects  from  the  completed  Phase  2b  study 
(205889), 183 of the 200 patients were exposed to ≥ 1200 mg FTR daily. 
Furthermore,  50  HIV-1-infected  treatment-naïve  and  treatment-experienced  subjects  in the  Phase  2a 
study 206267 were exposed to doses ranging from 1200 to 2400 mg FTR daily (with and without RTV, 
up to 200 mg) for up to 8 days. A total of 12 patients have been enrolled into the Early Access Programme 
and 767 healthy subjects across the completed clinical pharmacology studies were exposed to FTR (693) 
and  TMR  (66)  and  FTR/TMR  (8).  74  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment,  renal  impairment  or  opioid 
dependency  received  FTR.  In  general,  the  size  of  the  database  as  presented  by  the  applicant  can  be 
regarded sufficient, considering the claimed indication.  
ADRs (any Grade) were reported in 38%, 34%, 34% in the randomised, the non-randomised cohorts of 
the Phase 3 study and in the Phase 2b study, respectively. For the randomised cohort of the Phase 3 
study, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs (any Grade) ≥1% were, nausea (10%), diarrhea 
(4%),  headache  (4%),  dyspepsia  (3%),  fatigue  (2%),  insomnia  (2%),  depression  (2%),  IRIS  (2%), 
blood creatinine increased (2%), abdominal pain (1%), rash (1%), ECG QT prolonged (<1%). Two ADRs 
were  of  Grade  4  and  were  reported  for  Immune  Reconstitution  Inflammatory  Syndrome  and 
Rhabdomyolysis. 
Fatal events occurred in 4% of the patients. The most common causes of death in the Phase 3 study 
related to complications of AIDS and acute infection. One fatal event was considered as related to IRIS. 
ADRs for Hypersensitivity / Rash related AESIs were reported respectively in 3%, 3%, 4% of the patients 
and ADRs for ventricular tachyarrhythmia in < 1% of patients. The drug-related adverse events of special 
interest IRIS occurred in 2%, 2%, 0% and Musculoskeletal events in 2% of patients in the randomised 
and the non-randomised cohort of the Phase 3 study and the Phase 2b study, respectively.  
Updated data and analyses considering Week 144 data from Phase 3 study (with a cut-off date of 06-
September-2019) have been provided in addition to Week 96 data. Overall, no significant changes in 
rates or severity of reported AEs were detected. Furthermore, for a better understanding of the safety

profile of FTR, the applicant provided comparative data from the 8-days blinded period of the Phase 3 
random cohort as well as from the Phase 2b study and a comparison of safety data between FTR Phase 
3 study. Overall, no new safety signals were identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The Phase 3 study was limited by the lack of long-term comparative data, the severity of the underlying 
disease and the individualised OBT.  A comparison of safety data between the FTR Phase 3 study and 
published  studies  in  MDR-HIV  indication  with  comparable  patient  population  was  provided  by  the 
applicant (studies investigated ibalizumab, dolutegravir, maraviroc and enfuvirtide) and it did not identify 
a safety concern. It was concluded that the safety data reported during FTR Phase 3 study were in the 
range that was expected, considering the population studied. Nevertheless, the risk of “long term safety” 
was maintained as “Missing information” in the RMP taking into account that until now, analysed data 
from the Phase 3 study are available only up to week 144 and that patients may be taking this medication 
for the whole life. 
Safety data from the randomised, controlled Phase 2b study which are used as supportive evidence, are 
of limited value, because of the patient population: the patients did not have MDR-HIV, they had a better 
safety  profile  (without  any  acute  infections  related  to  AIDS,  higher  median  CD4+  T-cells  at  baseline, 
etc.), and the formulation and used dosage was not the same as used in the Phase 3 study. 
Limited data is available for patients with underlying cardiac diseases and for patients with concomitant 
medication.  This  might  increase  the  risk  of  QTc-prolongation  of  FTR  for  patients  with  underlying 
cardiovascular diseases and/ or concomitant medication. Therefore, ventricular tachyarrhythmias due to 
QTc prolongation are reflected in the RMP as an important potential risk.  
Weight increase for all patients treated with FTR throughout the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ranging from 4.2 
kg in the randomised cohort and 2.5 kg in the non-randomised cohort of the Phase 3 study and through 
the different treatment arms of the Phase 2b study (1.8 – 4.3 kg) was observed. The potential of long-
term risk of weight gain should be discussed in upcoming PSURs.  
Total and direct bilirubin elevations have been observed for patients treated with FTR. Analysis presented 
by the applicant did not identify an increased risk caused by FTR. However, cases with elevations in total 
and direct bilirubin should be closely monitored and discussed in upcoming PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
It is regarded as important to develop and license effective treatment options for patients infected with 
multidrug-resistant HIV. 
Whilst the clinical development programme did not follow the CHMP guidance, the combination of results 
from  the  submitted  studies  was  considered  to  support  the  potential  of  FTR  to  contribute  to  viral 
suppression and CD4 count recovery in the target patient population.  
There were some limitations to the data derived from the FTR clinical development programme regarding 
the efficacy of FTR and correlation between baseline factors and rate of virologic response. In particular, 
the CHMP considered that the virologic response to fostemsavir could not be reliably predicted from any 
EMA/702367/2020

pre-treatment  viral  attributes  (gp120  substitutions;  TMR  IC50  values).  The  effect  of  substitutions 
appeared to be context dependent, since their impact on in-vitro susceptibility has been shown to vary.  
However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  an  attempt  to  restrict  the  use  according  to  pre-treatment 
substitutions or IC50 would lead to unnecessarily excluding patients with MDR HIV-1 that might derive 
some benefit from treatment.  
No  major  safety  concerns  were  identified  during  the  assessment.  The  important  potential  risk  of 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia due to QT prolongation as well as missing information on the use in pregnant 
and  lactating  women  and  the  lack  of  long-term  safety  data  are  sufficiently  addressed  in  the  Risk 
Management Plan.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
FTR in combination with an OBT was able to keep HIV-1 viral load suppressed in 60% of subjects in the 
randomised cohort (who had at least 1 fully-active ARV in ≤2 ARV classes) and in 37% of subjects in the 
non-randomised cohort (who had zero full active ARV left) up to Week 96. The CHMP acknowledged that 
there are some uncertainties regarding the virologic activity of FTR, the risk of on-treatment selection of 
resistance and the patient population that would benefit most from an FTR-containing regimen. However, 
considering the overall benefits, the favourable safety profile as well as the fact that Rukobia is indicated 
as a last-line treatment, the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rukobia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Rukobia is favourable in the following indication: 
“Rukobia, in combination with other antiretrovirals, is indicated for the treatment of adults with 
multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive 
anti-viral regimen.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
EMA/702367/2020

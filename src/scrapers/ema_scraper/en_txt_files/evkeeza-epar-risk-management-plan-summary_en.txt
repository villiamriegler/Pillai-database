EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
RMP Version to Be Assessed as Part of This Application: 
RMP version number: 
1.2 
Data lock point for the RMP: 
25 Apr 2022 
Date of final sign-off: 
10 October 2023 
Rationale for Submitting an Updated RMP: 
The RMP for Evkeeza is being updated to include paediatric data from study 
R1500-CL-17100, an ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, openlabel study designed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and efficacy of evinacumab in paediatric patients with HoFH, to support 
the label extension within the EMA.  
In addition, the RMP including Part III Pharmacovigilance Plan, Part VI Summary of the 
Risk Management Plan and Annexes 2 and 3 are being updated to reflect the expanded study 
population of the post-authorisation safety study, UX858-CL401, which will be updated to 
align with the therapeutic indication, i.e., including paediatric patients aged 5 years and older.  
Summary of Significant Changes in This RMP: 
The following significant changes were introduced to the RMP: 
− Clinical exposure was updated to include exposure from completed and ongoing adult/ 
adolescent studies, as well as paediatric study in Module SIII. 
− Post-authorisation exposure was updated in Module SV. 
− Additional supportive information in Part II: Module SVII Identified and Potential Risks 
and Part III Pharmacovigilance Plan (no impact on summary of safety concerns) 
− Updated information relating to the study population of the post-authorisation safety study, 
UX858-CL401, which will be updated to align with the therapeutic indication, i.e., including 
paediatric patients aged 5 years and older. 
− Annex 2 and 3 were updated to reflect the expanded study population of the post-
authorisation safety study, UX858-CL401, which will be updated to align with the 
therapeutic indication, i.e., including paediatric patients aged 5 years and older.  
− Updates made in line with EMA guidance ‘Anonymisation of Protected Personal Data and 
assessment of Commercially Confidential Information during the preparation of RMPs (main 
body and annexes 4 and 6)’  
− Minor administrative formatting updates without change in data (marked as such

Brief description of the product 
Chemical class:  
Evinacumab is a recombinant, fully human 
immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that binds 
and inhibits human angiopoietin-like protein 3 
(ANGPTL3). 
Summary of mode of action: 
Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal 
antibody, which specifically binds to and inhibits 
ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is a member of the 
angiopoietin-like protein family that is expressed 
primarily in the liver and plays a prominent role in the 
regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting 
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). 
Evinacumab blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TG and 
HDL-C by releasing LPL and EL activities from 
ANGPTL3 inhibition, respectively. Evinacumab 
reduces LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL 
receptor (LDLR) by promoting very low-density 
lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and VLDL remnants 
clearance upstream of LDL formation through EL-
dependent mechanism. 
Important information about its composition: 
Evinacumab is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Chinese hamster ovary cell suspension 
culture.

PART II   SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) 
AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
HoFH is an ultra-rare genetic condition primarily caused by mutations in the LDLR gene, and 
less frequently by mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), 
apolipoprotein B, and LDL receptor adaptor protein 1 genes; more than 90% of HoFH results 
from LDLR mutations (Cuchel et al., 2014). 
Mutations in LDLR are classified into the following subtypes: 
1.  “Null/null” where little to no LDL binding and uptake activity exists (<15% LDLR 
activity) (Etxebarria et al., 2015; Banerjee et al., 2019; Gaudet et al., 2017), 
2.  Genotypically “negative/negative” where mutations in stop codons, frame shifts, 
splice site changes, small and large insertions/deletions, and copy number variations 
result in the loss of function of both LDLR alleles (Chora et al., 2018), or 
3.  Genotypically “defective” where missense mutations (hypomorphs) result in 
diminished LDLR activity (>15% LDLR activity). 
Regardless of the underlying mutations, lifelong exposure to extremely elevated LDL-C leads 
to an exceedingly high risk of developing premature atherosclerosis, as well as valvular and 
supravalvular stenosis. 
Prevalence: 
The Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported the prevalence of HoFH to be 
between 1 in 160,000 to 1 in 320,000 worldwide (Mach et al., 2020). The prevalence of 
HoFH can differ by country as methods used to identify cases vary (e.g., phenotypically, 
genotypic profiling, or calculation via the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication - Age, Gender, Racial 
and/or Ethnic Origin and Risk Factors for the Disease: 
The rarity of HoFH means, in addition to the literature being based on either small case series 
or cohort studies, that information on the demographics of the disease is limited. 
It is known that HoFH is an inherited disorder; thus, regions with isolated populations or 
higher rates of consanguineous marriages appear to have a higher prevalence of HoFH due to 
a founder effect for LDLR mutations (e.g., Afrikaaner-related populations in South Africa 
[1 in 30,000], Lebanese [1 in 100,000], and in the Horkuriku district of Japan [1 in 171,167]) 
(Raal and Santos, 2012). 
Although the published literature commonly notes that HoFH should be diagnosed in 
children, adolescents, or young adults, a high percentage of HoFH patients are not diagnosed 
in childhood (Alonso et al., 2016). The literature notes that in studies with molecular 
confirmation of HoFH, there is a high variability in patient’s age, cholesterol levels and 
cardiovascular disease.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
The HoFH International Clinical Collaborators Interim report, which was presented at the 
2018 EAS conference, reported limited demographic information on the first 220 patients 
with HoFH from 17 countries worldwide. In this report, the mean age at clinical diagnosis for 
HoFH was observed to be 17.7 years (± standard deviation [SD] ±17.4; range 1 to 79 years) 
(Hartgers et al., 2018). In a publication of the SAFEHEART registry, which included 
genetically identified HoFH patients (N = 31) from 2004 until 2015 living in Spain, the mean 
age of onset of treatment for these HoFH patients was 22.7 years (standard deviation 
[SD]±19.3) (Alonso et al., 2016). 
Main Existing Treatment Options: 
Patients with HoFH tend to be treated with multiple lipid-lowering treatment (LLTs) 
including statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and lipid apheresis; however, 
these treatments are largely ineffective for patients either due to LDLR mutations, problems 
with tolerability, and/or they are not available for the paediatric population. 
Treatment goals are to reduce LDL-C and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD). The ESC/EAS Consensus Panel recommends that in patients with FH and at very 
high risk, an LDL-C reduction of at least 50% and an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dL 
(1.42 mmol/L) should be considered (Mach et al., 2020). Due to the lifelong exposure to 
elevated LDL-C, aggressive lipid-lowering therapy should be started as early as possible in 
childhood (Wiegman et al., 2015). 
Common therapies such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are dependent on increasing LDLR 
activity, and many HoFH patients are therefore refractory to these treatments due to defects at 
the LDLR locus. For example, statins reduce LDL-C by more than 50% in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and polygenic forms of 
hypercholesterolemia, but statins decrease LDL-C by only <15% to 30% in HoFH patients. In 
patients with little or no LDLR activity (including null/null and negative/negative mutations), 
statins provide minimal to no efficacy (<15% reduction) (Raal et al., 2000; Rader et al., 2003; 
Stein et al., 2017). 
The addition of ezetimibe may further decrease LDL-C by 20% to 27% compared to statins 
alone, but patients with HoFH treated with a high dose statin and ezetimibe still remain far 
from their LDL-C goal and at substantial residual risk for coronary artery disease. 
PCSK9 inhibitors provide an effective treatment option in patients with HeFH and polygenic 
causes of hypercholesterolemia, but, similar to statins, are modestly effective in patients with 
HoFH. For example, treatment with alirocumab or evolocumab resulted in a mean reduction 
in LDL-C of approximately 30% compared to placebo (Raal et al., 2015; Blom et al., 2020). 
In the most difficult-to-treat patients with minimal residual LDLR function, on average 
alirocumab and evolocumab had minimal to no efficacy (<10% reduction) in lowering 
LDL-C (Blom et al., 2020; Raal et al., 2017; Raal et al., 2015). 
Of the available drugs for HoFH, lomitapide provides the greatest reductions in LDL-C (up to 
40% with the highest dose), but the drug is associated with dose-limiting safety issues that 
limit its efficacy (such as high rates of gastrointestinal side effects, hepatic steatosis, and 
abnormal liver function tests) (Raal et al., 2010; Cuchel et al., 2013). In an analysis of 1-year 
data from the Lomitapide Observational Worldwide Evaluation Registry project, the mean 
dose of lomitapide was 14.4 mg daily, which is well below the highest approved dose of 
60 mg daily (Khoury et al., 2019). Additionally, lomitapide is not approved for paediatric 
patients and thus not an option for patients under 18 years of age.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
The treatment of paediatric HoFH is also a serious dilemma for physicians and caregivers 
because most lipid-lowering therapies are only approved for use in adolescents/adults and 
none are approved for the treatment of young children less than 6 years old. However, 
considering the very high risk of premature ASCVD, the limited availability of apheresis to 
specialized centres or to medical facilities able to provide the necessary equipment and 
trained staff, and the complications related to liver transplantation, children are often 
prescribed off-label lipid-lowering therapy on a compassionate use basis. 
The majority of patients with HoFH could benefit from lipid apheresis (Goldberg et al., 2011) 
and in some European Union (EU) countries, this treatment modality is available and used. 
The procedure mechanically removes LDL-C from circulation and is efficacious in all 
patients with HoFH, regardless of their mutation status. However, the time-averaged 
reductions in LDL-C over an extended period (1 to 5 years) range between only 22% and 
36% (Wang et al., 2016). It is also the only therapeutic option recommended in patients under 
5 years of age. Despite its benefits, many patients do not have access to a qualified apheresis 
centre, and the cost, tolerability, and burden of weekly or biweekly apheresis sessions (lasting 
2 to 5 hours per session) are infeasible. A lipid-lowering treatment that could result in a 
decrease in frequency or discontinuation of apheresis would provide meaningful benefit to 
patients. 
Finally, liver transplantation, which normalises cholesterol levels, can be used to treat HoFH, 
especially in children. However, this is a very invasive procedure with many issues, including 
a high risk of post-transplantation surgical complications and mortality, paucity of donors, 
and need for life-long treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Accordingly, it is rarely 
used and viewed as a treatment option of last resort. 
Due to the limitations of currently available treatments, there exists a high unmet medical 
need for new therapeutic options that reduce LDL-C and the inevitable risk for premature 
ASCVD in patients with HoFH. The unmet medical need is particularly severe for HoFH 
patients with null/null or negative/negative mutations where currently available LLTs provide 
little benefit in lowering LDL-C and for paediatric HoFH patients who lack treatment 
options. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity: 
HoFH is a life-threatening genetic condition, which is typically characterised clinically by 
untreated plasma cholesterol levels >13 mmol/L (>500 mg/dL), presence of cutaneous or 
tendon xanthomas before the age of 10 years old, and premature and progressive ASCVD 
(Cuchel et al., 2014). Historically, the literature notes that patients with HoFH have a 
significantly increased risk of experiencing a fatal myocardial infarction when compared to 
the general population, with one study reporting a finding of a 100-times greater risk for 
patients with HoFH (Naveen et al., 2019). 
The first major cardiovascular event in patients with clinically diagnosed HoFH often occurs 
during adolescence (Raal et al., 2011; Kolansky et al., 2008; Al-Shaikh et al., 2002). Patients 
who are LDLR-negative have worse outcomes, with angina pectoris, myocardial infarctions, 
and deaths reported in early childhood. If these patients are untreated, they rarely survive 
beyond their second decade of life. Patients that are LDLR-defective typically have a longer 
life expectancy, but they develop clinically significant ASCVD by the age of 30 years old 
(Cuchel et al., 2014). 
Page 11 of 64 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
Mortality associated with HoFH has been reported in children as young as 1.5 years of age 
(Stanbury, 1983). Published case reports include death of a 2-year-old male; postmortem 
examination revealed advanced aortic root atheroma and aortic valve stenosis (Galiano et al., 
2020). Myocardial infarction leading to death was reported as early as 3 years of age in a 
patient with HoFH (Rose et al., 1982). Sudden death due to 98% stenosis in the left coronary 
artery was reported in a 4-year-old male with HoFH (Widhalm et al., 2011). A case report of 
fatal refractory asystolic cardiac arrest in a 4.5-year-old female also summarised an additional 
7 published reports of early death from CVD in children <5 years of age with HoFH 
(Gautschi et al.). 
The interim analysis of 220 patients enrolled in the HoFH International Clinical Collaborators 
registry showed that the mean age at first myocardial infarction and aortic valve replacement 
was 35.7 years (range 17 to 53 years) and 33.8 years (range 5 to 69 years), respectively. The 
mean age of death in 15 (7%) patients entered in the registry posthumously was 42.2 years 
(range 13 to 87 years) with the leading cause of death being cardiovascular (66.7%) (Hartgers 
et al., 2018). Therefore, these data show that even with currently available treatment, the 
mean age at death of HoFH patients is well below the general European life expectancy, 
estimated to be 80.9 years (Eurostat, 2019). 
Thompson et al. analysed data from two long-term retrospective surveys of patients from 
South Africa and the United Kingdom and identified 133 patients that were statin-naïve as of 
Jan 1990 and followed until death or the end of 2014 (Thompson et al., 2018). The results of 
their survival analysis show a significant association between on-treatment total cholesterol 
level and time to death. This analysis also concluded that the unadjusted comparison of 
patients who had one or more MACE while on treatment were older, more often Caucasian, 
and more likely to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease, as well as started LLT later in 
life and had less of a reduction in total cholesterol on treatment. The authors did note that 
patients with MACE were more often null/null or null/defective LDLR mutations, and there 
was no statistically significant difference in the risk of MACE by gender or pre-treatment 
total cholesterol. 
In conclusion, patients with HoFH have extreme elevations in LDL-C levels from birth, 
which leads to accelerated atherosclerosis, premature death from acute coronary syndromes, 
and is often associated with valvar and supra-valvar atheroma of the aortic root (Rallidis et 
al., 1998; Alonso et al., 2016). 
Important Co-morbidities: 
Due to the limited nature of studies conducted on this ultra-rare patient population, the 
specific frequency in which co-morbidities occur in patients with HoFH are not readily 
available in the literature. 
It is known that the natural history and disease progression of HoFH in general includes 
ASCVD complications and/or MACE. Additional co-morbidities that are commonly 
referenced with an association with hypercholesterolaemia include hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus; however, the exact frequency is not known in patients with HoFH (Cuchel et al., 
2014).

PART II: MODULE SII  NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
The nonclinical programme for evinacumab was consistent with the International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology derived 
pharmaceuticals and the supporting studies were conducted under the Good Laboratory 
Practices (GLP), as appropriate. 
The cynomolgus monkey, rabbit, and rat were considered to be the most appropriate species 
for toxicologic evaluation based on the in vitro binding data as well as the amino acid 
sequence homology between human, monkey, rabbit, and rat ANGPTL3. 
The results of a comprehensive carcinogenicity risk assessment, including review of data 
from repeat-dose toxicology studies and supporting information regarding ANGPTL3 
inhibition and ANGPTL3 loss of function available in the literature, indicate that chronic 
treatment with evinacumab does not pose an increased cancer risk. Based on this risk 
assessment, no further nonclinical studies (including no animal carcinogenicity studies) were 
considered necessary to assess the carcinogenic potential of evinacumab. 
The full details on the evinacumab nonclinical development programme were provided in the 
initial Marketing Authorisation application Module 2.4 and 2.6. 
Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Studies and Relevance to Human Usage: 
Toxicity 
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity 
During embryofoetal and fertility/postnatal developmental studies conducted in rats, 
evinacumab-related effects were limited to decreases in serum TG levels in maternal and F1 
animals at ≥30 mg/kg. Because there were no evinacumab-related foetal malformations or 
impacts on fertility, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for rat 
embryofoetal/developmental toxicity is 100 mg/kg/dose. 
In embryofoetal developmental studies in rabbits, embryofoetal toxicity was observed at 
dosages that induced maternal toxicity. Maternal toxicity consisted of early deaths, premature 
deliveries, and/or abortions at all dose levels; clinical signs and changes in body weight and 
food consumption also were observed. In addition, decreases in serum TG, HDL-C, and total 
cholesterol were seen, consistent with the pharmacology of evinacumab. Teratogenicity was 
observed in rabbit offspring at doses ≥5 mg/kg evinacumab. Based on the results of this 
rabbit study, a maternal NOAEL could not be determined, and the developmental NOAEL is 
considered to be 1 mg/kg/dose evinacumab. 
•  Relevance to human use: The clinical relevance of the rabbit findings to humans is 
unclear, based on lipid profile, as rabbits have significantly lower lipid levels than 
do humans at baseline (Yin et al., 2012), and therefore, may be uniquely sensitive 
to the lipid lowering effects of evinacumab during pregnancy. Further, it is also 
known that rabbits experience decreases in several lipid parameters during the 
third trimester of pregnancy (Zilversmit et al., 1972), whereas rats, and notably 
humans, experience increases (Liberati et al., 2004; Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 
2009; Ghio et al., 2011), a fact that may also limit the translational relevance of 
the rabbit data to human patients.

EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
The findings in rabbits, without similar findings in rats, are of uncertain relevance 
to humans. Nevertheless, embryofoetal toxicity is considered an important 
potential risk of evinacumab (refer to Part II: Module SVII). 
In the male fertility study in rabbits, there were no adverse findings related to the 
pharmacology of evinacumab. During the dosing period, prior to mating, there were 6 early 
evinacumab-related deaths caused by an anti-drug antibody (ADA)-related inflammatory 
response. Decreases in serum TG, HDL-C, and total cholesterol were observed, consistent 
with the pharmacology of evinacumab. Because there was no effect on male fertility 
observed, the NOAEL for this study is considered to be 300 mg/kg/dose, the highest dose 
level administered. Offspring from the untreated females presented with delayed 
ossification of caudal vertebrae. There were no teratogenic effects observed in the offspring 
in this study. 
•  Relevance to human use: None anticipated since this finding reflects normal 
variation in development and is not considered to be adverse (DeSesso and Scialli, 
2018). 
The juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. In juvenile rats, exposure to 
evinacumab was well tolerated, with no adverse effects evident at any dose level. Based on 
the lack of adverse effects, the NOAEL in juvenile rats is considered to be 100 mg/kg/dose 
(IV or subcutaneous [SC]), which represented the highest dose administered. 
Similarly, in a dose range finding study in juvenile rabbits, evinacumab-related effects were 
limited to those consistent with the intended pharmacology of evinacumab. During the 
subsequent GLP-compliant study in juvenile rabbits, administration of ≤300 mg/kg 
evinacumab once every 5 days via IV injection from postnatal day 21 through postnatal 
day 141 was well tolerated. The NOAEL is considered to be 300 mg/kg/dose, the highest 
dose evaluated. 
•  Relevance to human use: Juvenile toxicity studies in rats and rabbits did not 
identify any concerns for human paediatric use of evinacumab. 
Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data 
Anti-evinacumab antibody responses were generally low in monkeys and in rats 
(typically <25% of animals per study) and high in rabbits (typically >50%). Although ADA 
positivity correlated with lower evinacumab concentrations in serum, ADA did not impede 
the safety evaluation as exposure to total evinacumab was maintained throughout the dosing 
period in the majority of rats and monkeys at all dose levels, and in rabbits that 
received ≥30 mg/kg evinacumab. 
•  Relevance to human use: No impact on use in humans is anticipated.

PART II: MODULE SIII 
CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Overall, a total of 243 patients have been treated with any IV dose of evinacumab in either 
placebo-controlled or open-label trials across all HoFH and non-HoFH study populations. Of 
these, 139 patients had HoFH, of which 138 patients were treated with evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) for at least 24 weeks, 120 patients were treated for at least 52 weeks, 
and 78 patients were treated for at least 104 weeks. 
From the pooled data analysis, a total of 223 patients with HoFH or persistent 
hypercholesterolaemia received any IV dose of evinacumab in clinical trials, with a total 
duration of exposure of 4,825.1 months (402.1 patient-years). The majority of these patients 
(216/223: 96.9%) had at least 24 weeks of exposure and 90.6% (202/223) had at least 
48 weeks of exposure. 
Of these 223 patients, 119 (51.0%) had HoFH. One-hundred and eighteen HoFH patients 
were treated with evinacumab at the intended commercial dose of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W for at 
least 24 weeks and 116 of these patients were treated for at least 48 weeks. 
The integrated analysis strategy for the evinacumab clinical programme was divided into 
3 distinct pooled data sets, as described below. 
An overview of studies contributing to each integrated, pooled, analysis is provided in 
Table 1. 
Safety data from the R1500-CL-17100 paediatric study, which included paediatric patients 
aged ≥5 to <12 years, were not included in any of the integrated data pools since the pooled 
data focused on patients aged ≥12 years of age and is presented separately.

•  Pool 1 (Global Pool): The objective of this pool is to provide an accurate accounting of 
cumulative IV evinacumab exposure for each patient, taking into account a patient’s 
participation in one or more studies. The studies included in this pool are 
R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629 (double-blind treatment period [DBTP] and open-label 
treatment period [OLTP]), R1500-CL-1643 (DBTP and OLTP for Group B [IV treatment 
groups]), and R1500-CL-1719.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
No safety analyses were conducted on this global pool due to the heterogeneity of study 
designs. Specifically, differing design elements (i.e., parallel group versus crossover, 
placebo-controlled versus uncontrolled, treatment duration, and dose regimens) have the 
potential to introduce reporting bias, which would affect the interpretability of the pooled 
safety analyses. 
For details, refer to Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 patient exposure and duration of 
cumulative exposure by age and sex. Table 5 presents the patient exposure for HoFH 
indication. 
•  Pool 2 (Placebo-Controlled Studies): This is the primary pool for the integrated analysis 
of safety. The objective of this pool is to identify potential drug-related events using the 
pooled placebo group data as an estimate of background event rates. This pool is 
considered to contain the least biased data reporting. 
It provides an integration of 24 weeks of data from the DBTP of the phase 3 study in 
patients with HoFH (R1500-CL-1629) and the completed IV portion of the phase 2 study 
in patients with persistent hypercholesterolaemia (R1500-CL-1643). The DBTP of these 
2 studies have similar study design elements (e.g., assessments, schedule of assessments 
and common case report forms), which were pre-planned for the purpose of data 
integration. 
The safety data in this pool are divided into 3 treatment groups: 
•  Placebo IV Q4W 
•  Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W 
•  All evinacumab IV doses combined (5 mg/kg IV Q4W data from R1500-CL-1643 
plus 15 mg/kg IV Q4W from the DBTP of both R1500-CL-1643 and 
R1500-CL-1629). 
Both IV doses of evinacumab were included in Pool 2 to increase the number of patients 
exposed to evinacumab. Analysis of the 15 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen alone is included 
because this is the intended dose for registration in HoFH patients. The summary of 
demographics and study treatment exposure in Pool 2 are presented in Table 6 and 
Table 7, respectively. 
•  Pool 3 (Uncontrolled Studies): The objective of this pool is to incorporate safety data 
from additional patients who received evinacumab in an open-label setting including 
long-term safety data. 
The uncontrolled studies pool is an integration of open-label evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV 
Q4W data in patients with HoFH (R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1719) or persistent 
hypercholesterolemia (R1500-CL-1643). The OLTP of R1500-CL-1629 and 
R1500-CL-1643 and the open-label study R1500-CL-1719 have similar study design 
elements (e.g., assessments, schedule of assessments and common case report forms), 
which were pre-planned for the purpose of open label data integration. 
The open-label study R1500-CL-1331 is excluded from Pool 3 due to its study design, 
which is an unbalanced cross-over design with insufficient washout periods between 
treatments. Thus, the carry-over effect from each route of administration and dose of 
evinacumab cannot be quantified. 
In this Pool 3 analysis, a total of 206 patients received IV doses of evinacumab. The mean 
(SD) number of study drug infusions in the total evinacumab group was 20.04 (10.166) 
Page 16 of 64 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
with a mean (SD) duration of study drug exposure of 80.97 (41.189) weeks. The 
summary of study treatment exposure in Pool 3 is presented in Table 8. 
The primary pool for safety analysis is Pool 2, while results from Pool 3 are included to 
corroborate the findings from Pool 2. 
Pool 1 shows the overall patient exposure and demographic characteristics of patients treated 
with evinacumab within the clinical development programme. 
Detailed information on the clinical development programme for evinacumab is available in 
the initial Marketing Authorisation application Module 2.5 and 2.7.4.

Study R1500-CL-17100 was not included in the integrated pooled analysis because this study 
focuses on a paediatric population (patients aged 5-11 years) with HoFH and is described 
separately: 
R1500-CL-17100: This study consists of 3 parts: 
•  Part A: Phase 1b, single-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study; 
consists of up to 4 periods: Run-in Period, Screening Period, Single-dose 
OLTP, 16-week Observation Period, and Follow-up Period (Follow-up Period 
is for patients who do not enter Part C). 
•  Part B: Phase 3, OL efficacy and safety study; consists of up to 4 periods: 
Run-in Period; Screening Period; 24-week OLTP, and Follow-up Period 
(Follow-up Period for patients who do not enter Part C). 
•  Part C: Phase 3, OLE efficacy and safety study for Parts A and B; consists of 
2 periods: 48-week OLTP and 24-week Follow-up Period. 
A total of 20 patients were enrolled and treated within this study. The mean (SD) age 
of patients in the population was 9.0 (1.84) years at baseline, with an age range 
from ≥5 to <12 and a median age of 9.0 years. 
All 6 (100%) patients in Part A received a single infusion of evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV. Patients in Part B (N=14) had a mean (SD) number of infusions of 6.00 (0.000) 
over a mean (SD) duration of study drug exposure of 24.17 (0.639) weeks. Pooled 
data includes data from Part A patients during their participation in Part C and data 
from Part B patients during their participation in Parts B and C. In the pooled 
population (patients from part B and C), patients had a mean (SD) number of 
infusions of 12.75 (1.482) over a mean (SD) duration of study drug exposure of 
51.63 (5.283) weeks.

No 
The safety profile of 
evinacumab in HoFH 
patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment is not expected 
to differ from the general 
safety profile seen in HoFH 
patients. As a monoclonal 
antibody, evinacumab is not 
expected to undergo 
significant renal or hepatic 
elimination.  
SIV.2  Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial 
Development Programmes 
Because of the prevalence of the disease, the clinical development programme for 
evinacumab included a limited number of subjects. Such a programme is unlikely to detect 
certain types of adverse reactions, including less frequent adverse reactions. Moreover, the 
clinical development programme is unlikely to detect adverse reactions with long latency or 
those caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure (due to limited duration of clinical 
studies).

Exposure 
Pregnant women 
Not included in the clinical development programme. 
Five cases of evinacumab-exposed pregnancy 
occurred within the clinical development programme 
(refer to Part II: Module SVII). 
Breastfeeding women 
Not included in the clinical development programme. 
Patients with relevant comorbidities: 
•  Patients with hepatic impairment 
•  Patients with renal impairment 
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
were not included in the clinical development 
programme due to methodological reason, to prevent 
biases on the efficacy/safety endpoint evaluation. 
The effects of evinacumab in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment were not investigated since 
evinacumab is not expected to undergo significant 
hepatic elimination. 
Patients with severe renal impairment were not 
included in the clinical development programme due 
to methodological reason, to prevent biases on the 
efficacy/safety endpoint evaluation. 
The effects of evinacumab in patients with 
mild/moderate renal impairment were not 
investigated since evinacumab is not expected to 
undergo significant renal elimination.

POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE 
 SV.1 Post-Authorisation Exposure 
SV.1.1 Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
Information on actual patient exposure in post-marketing is not available. For the purpose of 
providing an estimated number of patient exposure, the following points are considered: 
−  Patient-years are calculated based on the actual number of vials sold/supplied. 
Each 2.3 mL vial contains 345 mg of evinacumab, and each 8 mL vial 
contains 1,200 mg of evinacumab. 
− 
− 
It is estimated that the recommended dosage of 15 mg/kg of evinacumab 
administered Q4W is followed for all patients. 
It is estimated that the entire vial contents are administered, and no medicinal 
product is discarded. 
−  An average patient weight of 60 kg is assumed. 
Page 29 of 64 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
−  13 represents the number of doses of evinacumab each patient is administered 
per year if the recommended dosage 15 mg/kg evinacumab Q4W is followed. 
Patient-years =  number of vials sold × vial size (mL) × vial strength (mg/mL)
60 kg × 15 mg/kg × 13
. 
SV.1.2 Exposure 
Cumulatively since the international birth date until 11 Feb 2023, the overall estimated 
post-marketing exposure to evinacumab is 207.5 patient-years. 
PART II: MODULE SVI 
ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR 
THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
Based on the molecular structure, pharmacokinetics and known mechanism of action of 
evinacumab, there is unlikely to be potential for misuse for illegal purposes. 
PART II: MODULE SVII 
IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS  
SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP: 
•  Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance, namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, 
and for which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered 
by prescribers (e.g., actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU 
Member State where the product is authorised): 
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and infusion reactions 
Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions were reported infrequently in clinical trials, with 
2 events of anaphylaxis of moderate intensity. 
Infusion reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with evinacumab (7.7%) 
compared to patients treated with placebo (3.7%), whereas general allergic events were 
reported at a similar frequency in the evinacumab group and the placebo group, and the 
incidence of these events was below 5% in the open-label pooled dataset. 
All foreign proteins (including monoclonal antibodies) have a known potential to induce 
hypersensitivity reactions, which may be life-threatening, especially if not identified early 
and managed by treatment discontinuation and timely intervention, including use of 
supportive care or emergency measures. 
Evinacumab is an intravenous medicinal product intended to be administered in a setting 
where infusions can be given with the appropriate measures for the management of such 
reactions as part of standard clinical practice. As such, this risk will be further monitored via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
Important Identified Risk: 
•  None 
Important Potential Risk:  
•  Embryofoetal Toxicity 
Risk-benefit impact: The nonclinical studies in rabbits, but not in rats, showed reproductive 
toxicity of evinacumab with unknown clinical relevance to humans due to the lower baseline 
lipid levels in rabbits compared to humans during pregnancy (Yin et al., 2012). 
Since human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are known to cross the placenta barrier, 
evinacumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and 
evinacumab may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. At the DLP of 
this RMP, there have been 5 pregnancies in clinical trial subjects, with no pregnancy outcome 
reports of embryofoetal toxicity, congenital malformations or abnormalities in any of these 
newborns. All reported pregnancy outcomes reported delivery of a healthy newborn with no 
observations of embryofoetal toxicity. 
In the absence of comprehensive data on use of evinacumab during pregnancy, the potential 
impact on pregnancy or foetal development is unknown. 
Missing Information:  
•  Safety of Long-Term Use (e.g., 2 Years) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
The experience with administration of evinacumab is currently limited. At the DLP of this 
RMP, 76 patients from clinical studies (34.1% of exposed patients) have a duration of 
exposure of longer than 2 years (≥108 weeks). 
In addition to the observed safety data across the evinacumab programme, there is also 
supportive safety information for ANGPTL3 inhibition through human genetic studies in 
individuals with loss-of-function ANGPTL3 variants (Module 5.3.5.4. Cardiovascular Risk 
and Other Clinical Phenotypes in People with Loss-of-Function Genetic Variants in 
ANGPTL3). These populations did not have an increased risk of liver disease, type 2 
diabetes, neurological diseases, or adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and were not associated 
with risk of cancer, overall mortality, age at parental death, or any other disease outcome. 
This implies that there is likely no increased risk of any of these events with evinacumab. 
Although there are real-world data for the absence of risks outlined above (e.g., adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes or cancer) in patients with loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3, 
there is limited information available on long-term safety of evinacumab treatment in HoFH 
patients from the evinacumab clinical development programme. No new safety concerns were 
identified in patients who had treatment exposure of 2 years or longer. 
•  Use in pregnant or breast-feeding women 
Risk-benefit impact: There is currently only limited experience with the use of evinacumab 
during pregnancy and no experience with the use during breast-feeding. The nonclinical 
studies in rabbits but not rats showed reproductive toxicity of evinacumab with unknown 
clinical relevance to humans. 
Page 31 of 64 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
At the DLP of this RMP, there have been 5 pregnancies in clinical trial subjects, with no 
pregnancy outcome reports of embryofoetal toxicity, congenital malformations or 
abnormalities in any of these newborns. 
It is currently not known whether evinacumab is excreted in human milk and as such, a risk 
to the breastfed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. It is known that antibodies are present in 
human milk (Czosnykowska-Łukacka et al., 2020). 
SVII.3  Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, 
and Missing Information 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
Important Potential Risk: Embryofoetal Toxicity  
Potential Mechanisms:  
The mechanism is not yet established for evinacumab in humans as clinical relevance of 
findings seen in rabbits is unclear, giving the different lipid profiles in humans and rabbits 
during pregnancy. 
Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placenta barrier; therefore, evinacumab has the 
potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
The nonclinical development programme showed reproductive toxicity associated with 
evinacumab in rabbits, but not in rats (refer to Part II: Module SII). 
In rabbits, the embryofoetal toxicity was observed at doses that induced maternal toxicity. 
Maternal toxicity (premature neonatal death, foetal loss and/or premature delivery) was 
observed at all doses and foetal findings (soft tissues and skeletal malformations) were 
observed at all but the lowest dose (1 mg/kg). Mean systemic exposure measured during the 
gestation period in rabbits was below that measured at maximum recommended human dose 
of 15 mg/kg Q4W. 
The clinical relevance of these findings from reproduction studies is unclear, as rabbits have 
significantly lower lipid levels than do humans at baseline (Yin et al., 2012), and therefore, 
may be uniquely sensitive to the lipid-lowering effects of evinacumab during pregnancy. 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of evinacumab in pregnant women. 
Characterisation of the Risk:  
Frequency, Severity and Nature of Risk  
Not yet established as there are no adequate or well-controlled trials of evinacumab in 
pregnant women. 
•  Pool 1 (Global; Clinical Trial Exposure): 
Cumulatively, a total of 5 pregnancies have been reported within the evinacumab clinical trial 
programme. This includes 4 pregnancies in 3 female patients (including 1 female who 
received study drug during the first trimester while in study R1500-CL-1629 during the 
DBTP who later enrolled in study R1500-CL-1719 and became pregnant a second time while 
exposed to evinacumab during first trimester of gestation) and 1 pregnancy in the female

partner of a male patient who received evinacumab. The pregnancy outcomes for the 
4 pregnancies in 3 female patients exposed to evinacumab and the pregnancy in a female 
partner of a male patient exposed to evinacumab included full term delivery with no reports 
of embryofoetal toxicity or other abnormalities. Exposure to evinacumab was in the first 
trimester of gestation in all 5 pregnancies. 
•  Pool 2 (Placebo-controlled studies): 
No reports of pregnancy. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Any woman of childbearing potential who receives evinacumab has a potential risk of 
embryofoetal toxicity. 
Preventability: 
All women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during evinacumab 
treatment and at least 5 months after the last dose. This is based on the elimination of 
evinacumab in patients with HoFH treated with a dose of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. It is estimated 
to take approximately 19 weeks for the concentration of evinacumab to decline from the last 
dose at a steady state to reach a systemic concentration below the lower limit of quantitation. 
Adherence to these recommendations should limit the evinacumab exposure during 
pregnancy and prevent any potential adverse effects on foetal development. 
Evinacumab should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
The nonclinical studies in rabbits, but not in rats, showed embryofoetal toxicity of 
evinacumab with unknown clinical relevance to humans. Since human IgG antibodies are 
known to cross the placenta barrier, evinacumab has the potential to be transmitted from the 
mother to the developing foetus and evinacumab may cause foetal harm when administered 
to pregnant women. In the absence of comprehensive data on use of evinacumab during 
pregnancy, the potential impact on pregnancy or foetal development is unknown and remains 
to be elucidated. 
Public Health Impact:  
Not yet established for evinacumab. 
SVII.3.2  Presentation of the Missing Information 
Missing Information: Safety of Long-Term Use (e.g., >2 Years) 
Evidence Source: 
The experience with administration of evinacumab in clinical trials is limited. At the DLP of 
this RMP, 76 patients from clinical studies (34.1% of exposed patients in the development 
program) have a duration of exposure of longer than 2 years (≥ 108 weeks). The safety profile 
of evinacumab for patients who have received evinacumab treatment for 2 years or longer is 
consistent with the safety profile of evinacumab for patients with shorter periods of treatment. 
In addition to the observed safety data across the evinacumab programme, there is also 
supportive safety information for ANGPTL3 inhibition through human genetic studies in 
individuals with loss-of-function ANGPTL3 variants (Module 5.3.5.4. Cardiovascular Risk 
Page 33 of 64 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
and Other Clinical Phenotypes in People with Loss-of-Function Genetic Variants in 
ANGPTL3). These populations did not have an increased risk of liver disease, type 2 
diabetes, neurological diseases, or adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and were not associated 
with risk of cancer, overall mortality, age at parental death, or any other disease outcome. 
This implies that there is likely no increased risk of any of these events with evinacumab.  
Although there are real-world data for the absence of risks outlined above (e.g., adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes or cancer) in patients with loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3, 
there is limited information available on long-term safety of evinacumab treatment in HoFH 
patients from the evinacumab clinical development programme. 
Population in Need of Further Characterisation: 
The long-term data are needed to confirm the safety data collected for evinacumab from the 
clinical development programme. The safety profile of evinacumab with long-term use will 
continue to be monitored. 
Missing Information: Use in Pregnant or Breast-feeding Women 
Evidence Source: 
There is limited experience with the use of evinacumab during pregnancy. Cumulatively, 
5 pregnancies have been reported for evinacumab, from clinical trials, for which there are 
reported pregnancy outcomes. 
The nonclinical development programme showed reproductive toxicity associated with 
evinacumab in rabbits, but not in rats with unknown relevance to human use due to the lower 
baseline lipid levels in rabbits compared to humans during pregnancy (Yin et al., 2012) (refer 
to Part II: Module SII). 
There is no experience with the use of evinacumab during breast-feeding. It is unknown 
whether evinacumab is excreted in human or animal breast milk. It is known that antibodies 
are secreted in human milk (Czosnykowska-Łukacka et al., 2020). 
Anticipated Risk/Consequence of the Missing Information: 
The use of evinacumab may adversely affect the course of pregnancy and foetal development, 
based on the nonclinical findings. 
It is currently not known whether evinacumab is excreted in human milk and as such, a risk 
to the breast-fed newborn/infant cannot be excluded.

Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
III.2.1 Post-authorisation (EMA) Safety Study (PASS)  
Study Short Name and Title: 
UX858-CL401: An observational study to evaluate the long-term effects of evinacumab 
treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
HoFH is an ultrarare and life-threatening disease.  
At present, there is no cure for HoFH, and the treatment regimen for HoFH is complex and 
presents major therapeutic challenges. Evinacumab is intended for chronic, lifelong use, 
understanding long-term effects in the overall population of patients receiving treatment will 
be informative to patients, caregivers, prescribers, as well as payers. The existing EAS FH 
Studies Collaboration (FHSC) Global FH Registry provides an established source to obtain 
data on the long-term effects of evinacumab in real-world use for analysis. 
UX858-CL401 is a 5-year, international, observational, retrospective cohort study using data 
collected by the existing EAS FHSC Global FH Registry. 
If feasible, the proposed study objectives will include: 
•  To evaluate the long-term safety outcomes in patients with HoFH who are 
≥5 years old1 and treated with evinacumab. 
•  To evaluate the frequency and outcomes of pregnancy in female patients with 
HoFH who are treated with evinacumab. 
•  To evaluate changes in the atherosclerosis process over time in patients with 
HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo cardiovascular imaging (as 
data allow). 
•  To evaluate the frequency of cardiovascular imaging of patients with HoFH. 
List of Addressed Safety Concerns: 
•  Embryofoetal toxicity 
•  Safety of long-term use (e.g., 2 years)Use in pregnant or breast-feeding women 
(note that pregnancy information will be evaluated in the proposed Long-Term 
Safety Study to address the potential risk of embryofoetal toxicity). 
1 Of note, although the current study population includes patients who are 5 years and older and have a 
diagnosis of HoFH, the study population may be adjusted and expanded if the approved indication for 
evinacumab extends to cover other patient groups.

EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
Study Design: 
A 5-year observational cohort study using data collected by the existing EAS FHSC Global 
FH Registry 
Study Population: 
Patients included in the existing EAS FHSC Global FH Registry are the source population for 
the study analyses. To address the study objectives, the following cohorts will be established: 
•  Evinacumab cohort will include all patients aged 5 years1 and older who have a 
diagnosis of HoFH and initiated commercially available evinacumab and have 
received evinacumab treatment during the analysis year. 
•  Historical cohort will include HoFH patients aged 5 years1 and older without 
exposure to evinacumab. 
Milestones: 
The protocol was initially adopted by Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) on 07 Apr 2022. 
After the DLP of this RMP, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and revised protocol were 
submitted on 20 Sep 2022 and a positive PRAC outcome has been received for the PASS

PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR EVKEEZA 
(EVINACUMAB)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for EVKEEZA. The RMP details 
important risks of EVKEEZA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about EVKEEZA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
EVKEEZA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how EVKEEZA should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for EVKEEZA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
EVKEEZA’s RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
EVKEEZA is authorised for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 5 years and 
older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains evinacumab as the active substance and it is given by IV route. 
Further information about the evaluation of EVKEEZA’s benefits can be found in 
EVKEEZA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage (Evkeeza, European Medicines Agency (europa.eu)). 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of EVKEEZA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about EVKEEZA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
Page 44 of 64 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
EVKEEZA (Evinacumab) 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of EVKEEZA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of EVKEEZA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of EVKEEZA. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B 
Summary of Important Risks 
Important Potential Risk: Embryofoetal Toxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The nonclinical development programme showed reproductive toxicity 
associated with evinacumab in rabbits, but not in rats. 
In rabbits, the embryofoetal toxicity was observed at doses that induced 
maternal toxicity. Maternal toxicity (premature neonatal death, foetal 
loss and/or premature delivery) was observed at all doses and foetal 
findings (soft tissues and skeletal malformations) were observed at all 
but the lowest dose (1 mg/kg). Mean systemic exposure measured 
during the gestation period in rabbits was below that measured at 
maximum recommended human dose of 15 mg/kg Q4W. 
The clinical relevance of these findings from reproduction studies is 
unclear, as rabbits have significantly lower lipid levels than do humans 
at baseline (Yin, 2012), and therefore, may be uniquely sensitive to the 
lipid lowering effects of evinacumab during pregnancy.  
There is a limited amount of data from the use of evinacumab in 
pregnant women. Cumulatively, at the DLP of this RMP, 5 pregnancy 
case reports have been received, which were from clinical trial exposure 
and pregnancy outcomes have been reported. In the evinacumab clinical 
development program, there have been 4 pregnancies in 3 female 
patients (1 female patient had 2 pregnancies) who received evinacumab, 
and 1 pregnancy in the female partner of a male patient who received 
evinacumab.

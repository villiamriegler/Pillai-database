1.  Introduction 
On June 17 2014, the MAH submitted data from an extension (E1) to the paediatric study 
CIGE025B1301 for Xolair, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Data from study CIGE025B1301 has previously been presented as P46 039. This was a 24 week, open 
label, multi-center evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of 
omalizumab in Japanese children (6-15 years) with inadequately controlled allergic asthma despite 
current recommended treatment. The extension study presented here was designed to offer 
continuation of omalizumab treatment to pediatric patients who had previously completed the core 
study and required continuous treatment with omalizumab, and to further assess the long-term safety 
and tolerability of omalizumab. The study (study drug administration) lasted until omalizumab was 
approved/launched for pediatric indication in Japan (20-Aug-2013). 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for CIGE025B1301E1. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
CIGE025B1301E1: An extension study to CIGE025B1301 to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability 
and efficacy of omalizumab in Japanese children (6 - 15 years) with inadequately controlled allergic 
asthma despite current recommended treatment.  
Description 
This study was the extension study of the core study (CIGE025B1301). This was a multi-centre, single-
arm, open-label study which consisted of a treatment period and an optional follow-up investigation for 
anti-omalizumab antibody. This study (study drug administration) lasted until omalizumab was 
approved/launched for paediatric indication in Japan (20- Aug-2013).

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of omalizumab as add-on therapy in 
Japanese paediatric patients with inadequately controlled allergic asthma despite current 
recommended treatment.  
Exploratory objectives: 
• To explore the effect of omalizumab in Japanese paediatric patients on: 
• Asthma control based on Japanese Paediatric Asthma Control Program (JPAC) 
• Quality of life questionnaire(s) score 
• Use of asthma long-term control medications 
• Pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, V50 [FEF50], V25 [FEF75], FEF25-75%) 
• To collect the data on the number of hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits due to asthma 
• To collect the data of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (serum free IgE level) in Japanese 
paediatric patients. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Although PK/PD was listed as objectives of the study no PK data was presented.   
Study population /Sample size 
Patients who had completed the core study and who in the investigator’s clinical judgment could 
benefit from continued treatment with omalizumab were considered for the study.A total of 38 patients 
entered the extension study and were treated with omalizumab. Of 38 patients, 35 patients completed 
the study and 3 discontinued. 
The mean age of the patient population was 11.5 years (range: 7 - 16 years), with approximately 30% 
of the patients being 9 years or younger. The ratio of male and female was 3:2. The mean weight was 
40.13 kg (range: 24.2 - 69.8 kg). The mean FEV1 (% of predicted value) was 89.82% and was shown 
near normal value as baseline value (90.29%) in the core study. The mean duration of asthma was 9.3 
years. 29 patients (76.3%) had inadequately controlled asthma evaluated by Japanese paediatric 
asthma control program (JPAC) score. 
Assessor’s comment: 
All 38 patients that completed the core study entered the extension phase.   
Treatments 
Xolair 75 to 375 mg was given subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks.  The starting doses (mg) and 
dosing frequency of this study were the same as those of the core study (allowing for adjustment in 
case of considerable change in body weight).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: Asthma control, spirometry measurements (FEV1, FVC, V50 [FEF50], V25 [FEF75], FEF25-75%), 
use of asthma long-term control medications, hospitalization and ER visits, and QOL.  
Safety: Collection of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity and 
relationship to study drug. They included the regular monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry and 
urine performed at the central laboratory and regular assessments of vital signs, physical examination, 
height and body weight.  
Bioanalytics: PK/PD parameters evaluated were serum total omalizumab, free IgE and total IgE. 
Antiomalizumab antibody was also evaluated. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
At the last assessment, 29 patients (76.3%) achieved complete asthma control or were well controlled 
compared to 9 patients (23.7%) at the start of the extension study. Mean JPAC score (SD) was 9.9 
(2.80) at start of the extension study, and mean change from baseline (95% CI) was 2.6 (1.5, 3.6) at 
48 weeks, 2.9 (1.9, 3.8) at 96 weeks, and 3.0 (2.0, 4.0) at the last assessment, respectively. At the 
last assessment, the median of two QOL domain scores (physical and emotional) and overall QOL score 
are 29.0, 19.0 and 48.0, respectively and reached almost full scores (full scores are 30, 20, and 50, 
respectively). A statistically significant improvement in each of QOL scores at the last assessment was 
observed compared to baseline of the core a study (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). 
Most spirometry measurements increased from baseline of the core study at all visits during the 
treatment period, but the changes in these measurements from baseline of the core study were small. 
The mean change from baseline of the core study in FEV1 (% of predicted value) was −1.05% (95% 
CI: −6.17, 4.08) at the last assessment. The mean change from baseline of the core study in FEF25-
75% (per cent of predicted value) was −1.23% (95% CI: −9.45, 6.99) at the last assessment. 
Safety results 
Of a total of 38 patients in the Safety set, all patients experienced at least one AE during the treatment 
period. The most common AE (≥ 50%) by primary SOC was infections and infestations (92.1%), 
followed by gastrointestinal disorders (71.1%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(57.9%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (55.3%). The most common AE by PT (≥ 30%) 
was nasopharyngitis (52.6%), followed by influenza (39.5%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(36.8%), and asthma (34.2%). Eleven patients (28.9%) experienced at least one AE suspected to be 
related to the study drug during the treatment period of the extension study. The AEs suspected to be 
related to the study drug (reported in ≥ 2 patients) were injection site swelling (4 patients), headache 
(2 patients). Other suspected AEs were reported each in one patient. Most of AEs were moderate 
(97.4%) and only one patient was mild (2.6%) in severity. Severe AEs were not reported. The 
incidence of AEs did not increase with prolonged use of the study drug. No major difference was 
observed in the incidences of AEs by subgroup compared to overall incidences of AEs. No patients died 
nor discontinued the study or interrupted the study drug temporarily due to an AE. A total of 10 
patients (26.3%) experienced SAEs (hospitalization) during the treatment period. Asthma exacerbation 
(PT: asthma) was reported in 7 patients and SAEs other than asthma exacerbation was reported in 7

events (tonsillitis, viral pharyngitis, peritonsillar abscess, lymphadenitis, appendicitis, pneumonia, and 
foot fracture) for 4 patients.

Follow-up investigation for anti-omalizumab antibody (Visit 999) was performed in 10 patients; no 
antiomalizumab antibodies were detected. 
Bioanalytical results 
The mean serum free IgE level was suppressed below 25 ng/mL (target level) during the treatment 
period. Mean total omalizumab and total IgE levels at the steady state were also comparable with 
those observed in the core study.  
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The data presented in this extension study is difficult to interpret as the study is open, single armed 
and all comparisons are made relatively baseline values, i.e. values at the end of the core phase of the

study. There is no positive or negative control that that would allow direct comparisons. Nevertheless, 
no unexpected findings were recorded neither with regard to efficacy of safety. Efficacy appears to be 
maintained and the adverse events recorded were expected considering the known safety profile of 
Xolair. Due to the relatively low number of subjects (35 completing) less common adverse events are 
not captured with precision.    
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The study report for study CIGE025B1301E1 is taken note of. Both efficacy and safety data as 
collected were consistent with previous paediatric data recorded for Xolair. Benefit/risk remains 
unchanged.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking full approval for ripretinib with the following target indication: 
Qinlock is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
(GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour,  GIST,  is  a  rare  sarcoma,  however  the  most  common  malignant 
mesenchymal tumour of the gastrointestinal tract. It arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The most 
common  primary  site  being  the  gastric  GIST,  but  it  can  occur  throughout  the  gastrointestinal  tract 
(Aubin,  2011,  Miettinen  and  Lasota,  2006).  There  is  a  slight  prevalence  in  males.  The  median  age  is 
around  60–65  years,  with  a  wide  range.  Occurrence  in  children  is  very  rare.  GIST  represents 
approximately 0.1% to 3.0% of all GI malignancies (Nilsson et al, 2005) with annual incidences between 
4.3 and 22 per million population worldwide. Most studies report annual incidences of 10 to 15 per million 
in European countries. For localized, potentially resectable disease, initial treatment includes surgery, 
followed  by  adjuvant  therapy  with  imatinib  for  patients  with  increased  risk  of  recurrence  due  to  poor 
prognostic  factors,  such  as  mitotic  rate,  tumour  size  and  tumour  site  (gastric  GISTs  have  a  better 
prognosis than small bowel or rectal GISTs). Tumour rupture is an additional adverse prognostic factor 
and should be recorded, regardless of whether it took place before or during surgery.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
GISTs are primarily characterised by gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogene proteins, KIT 
(CD117) or PDGFRA. The majority of GISTs (80% to 85%) harbour primary driver mutations in the KIT 
gene  (~75% of cases), or PDGFRA (~10% of cases) and these may affect the juxta-membrane, 
extracellular, or catalytic kinase domains (in-frame deletions, insertions, or missense mutations (Emile, 
2011, Antonescu, 2011). Certain types of mutations are reflected in response on known therapies. At 
presentation, mutations in the KIT gene are usually found in exon 9 or 11. Primary mutations in exon 
11 disrupt the auto inhibited form of the kinase, and mutations in exon 9 increase receptor 
dimerization, often requiring an increase in treatment dosage of imatinib. High-dose imatinib in 
patients with exon 9 mutations may improve progression-free survival (PFS) but has no reported effect 
on overall survival (OS) (MetaGIST, 2010). PDGFRA exhibits more rarely primary mutations (exons 18, 
12 and 14). Exon 18 mutations occur in approximately 6% of GIST, and the most frequent mutation is 
a substitution in exon 18 D842V (Cassier et al, 2012; Yoo et al, 2016a), which confers resistance to 
imatinib. A small percentage (10-15%) of GISTs are classified as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type (WT) due to 
the absence of driver mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA (Kee 2012; Demetri, 2007). The largest 
subgroup of wild-type GIST is characterised by deficiencies in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) 
complex and, in addition, activating BRAF mutation has been detected in a small percentage of GISTs.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most tumours are of gastric origin (67.3%), followed by small intestine (15.4%), mesentery (5.8%), 
rectum and colon (5.8%), esophagus (3.8%), and the ovary (1.9%). Gastrointestinal bleeding is the 
most common clinical presentation of GISTs, but other features may include intestinal obstruction, 
abdominal pain, perforation, or a palpable pelvic mass, which may be incidentally detected during a 
gynecological, urological, or endoscopic/radiological procedure or surgery. After patients display 
symptoms or an asymptomatic mass is detected, GISTs are usually diagnosed by CT, MRI, PET scan 
endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography techniques. Primary site for metastasis is the liver.  
Pathologically, the diagnosis of GIST relies on morphology and immunohistochemistry. In addition, 
inclusion of mutational analysis in the diagnostic work-up of all GISTs is considered standard practice. 
Mutational analysis has a predictive value for sensitivity to molecular-targeted therapy. Prognosis 
varies according to tumour size, mitotic rate, location, and mutation status. In general, tumours of <2 
cm are considered of low metastatic risk, whereas larger tumours carry more risk, particularly if they 
display of a higher mitotic rate (Casali, 2018). GIST located in the stomach is typically of a lower risk 
compared to intestinal GIST. Mutational status has not been incorporated in any risk classification at 
present (ESMO 2018) although, mutation status has been shown to carry some correlation with 
prognosis. 
2.1.5.  Management 
For localized, potentially resectable disease, initial treatment includes surgery, followed by adjuvant 
therapy with imatinib for patients with increased risk of recurrence due to poor prognostic factors. 
Adjuvant treatment with imatinib for 3 years was associated with a relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS 
advantage in comparison with 1 year of adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients in a randomised trial. 
Data have shown that patients with tumours harbouring the KIT exon 9 mutation have significantly 
better PFS on a higher dose level, i.e. 800mg daily, which is therefore held as standard treatment 
(Zalcberg JR, 2005). 
Although imatinib have a great therapeutic effect on GIST patients, acquired resistance to imatinib 
occurs in a median treatment period of less than 2 years (C.D. Blanke, 2008, J. Verweij, 2004), having 
a 60% response rate and median PFS of 18 to 24 months (Demetri et al, 2002; Blanke et al, 2008).  
There are 3 types of disease progression due to resistance seen with imatinib-therapy: 
•  Primary resistance occurs in about 10% to 15% of patients that do not respond to therapy or achieve 
disease stabilisation within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment 
•  Acquired  secondary  resistance  occurs  after  about  2  years  and  usually  results  from  secondary  KIT 
mutations.  
•  Disease progression due to PK resistance occurs in up to 30% of GIST patients. PK resistance results 
from inadequate drug exposure due to a variety of reasons such as inadequate dose used for patients 
with an exon 9 mutation, poor patient compliance or concomitant drug interactions (Kee, 2012). 
Sunitinib (authorized for 2nd line GIST) and regorafenib (authorized for 3rd line GIST) are less effective, 
showing a response rate of 5% to 7%, and a median PFS of 5-6 months. Patients with a PDGFRA 
D842V mutation (5-6% of patients with advanced GIST) are generally insensitive to imatinib and the 
TKI avapritinib has recently been approved (positive opinion CHMP July 2020) for this specific 
indication, based on a phase 1 SAT (MC Heinrich, 2020). 
Activation loop mutations accumulate with increasing frequency after second-line therapy (sunitinib), 
which also has inadequate activity on activation loop mutant proteins (Heinrich et al, 2008; Liegl et al, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 13/134 
 
 
 
2008). When patients reach 4th line therapy, multiple resistance mutations are present, and presently 
no other agents have any proven clinical activity. 
In  May  2020,  the  US  FDA  approved  Qinlock™  (ripretinib)  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
There are still no approved treatment options in the EU for this late line (4th line and later line) setting 
for the GIST patient population. 
Unmet Medical Need 
Metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that progresses after treatment with 2 currently approved tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitors,  imatinib  and  sunitinib,  is  a  highly incapacitating  and  life-threatening  condition,  with 
poor prognosis (EMA/CHMP/348464/2014). Currently, only regorafenib is approved in the 3rd line setting 
in Europe, and there are no standard treatment options for this patient population in later line settings 
in Europe. 
Over  95%  of  GISTs  express  KIT  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  and  the  majority  of  GISTs  are  driven  by 
activating  mutations  in  KIT  or  the  related  PDGFRA  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (Liegl,  2008;  Heinrich, 
2003b). The three available KIT-targeted therapies approved for the treatment of GIST in Europe provide 
benefits to some patients. However, clinical response is limited and short-lived, and primary resistance 
to  these  treatments  can  also  occur  for  example,  primary  resistance  to  imatinib  is  seen  in  ~15%  of 
patients (Demetri, 2013). 
Resistance to therapy occurs in the majority of patients within a few months to years (Blay,2011), similar 
to patterns observed in other cancers successfully treated with targeted therapies. 
Secondary resistance mutations in KIT after targeted therapy usually arise in the catalytic domain of the 
kinase. Secondary mutations in KIT typically occur in exons 13 and 14 (near the ATP-binding pocket and 
the conformation-controlling switch pocket); mutations in this region sterically disrupt drug binding or 
conformationally activate KIT. Secondary mutations may also occur in the activation loop (conformation-
controlling switch) encoded by exons 17 and 18. Activation loop mutations act by shifting the kinase into 
an  activated  conformation  that  is  less  amenable  to  drug  binding  by  any  of  the  approved  therapies 
(Gajiwala, 2009). 
Third  line  treatment  with  regorafenib  provides  only  limited  and  short-lived  benefit,  with  modest 
lengthening of PFS by 4.8 months (95% CI 4.0, 5.7) and no improvement of OS and/or QoL compared 
with placebo.  (EMA/CHMP/348464/2014). In the 4th line setting or after, once patients have received 
imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib and experienced disease progression or cannot tolerate regorafenib 
despite dose reductions, there is no approved treatment option (except for PDGFRA D842V mutations) 
for patients with advanced or unresectable GIST (Casali, 2018). 
For patients who have progressed on the approved drugs, progression of KIT-driven tumours is primarily 
based on development of further KIT resistant mutations. At present, there are no approved targeted 
therapies that broadly inhibit secondary drug-resistant mutations in GIST. 
Thus, in Europe, a high unmet medical need remains for kinase inhibitors that are effective against these 
mutant forms of KIT and PDGFRA.

About the product 
Ripretinib is a novel agent belonging to the class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The drug product is 
presented as immediate release white to off-white oval tablets for oral administration. Each tablet 
contains 50 mg of ripretinib. The recommended dose for clinical use is 150 mg (3 × 50 mg tablets) 
once daily taken with or without food.  
Ripretinib is a switch-control TKI that broadly inhibits KIT and PDGFRA kinase signaling through a dual 
mechanism of action. Ripretinib is designed to precisely and durably bind to both the switch pocket and 
the activation loop to lock the kinase in the inactive state, preventing downstream signalling, cell 
proliferation and to slow down the growth of the tumours and reduce symptoms of the disease. This 
dual mechanism of action is suggested to provide a broad inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA kinase activity, 
including wild type as well as primary and secondary mutations. Based on early data, ripretinib also 
showed inhibition of other kinases in vitro, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta 
(PDGFRB), tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie-2 (TIE2), VEGFR2 and BRAF.  
The indication approved by the CHMP is: treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal 
stromal tumour (GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, 
including imatinib. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme for ripretinib began in 2015 and consists of 8 clinical studies 
Three studies have been initiated with ripretinib in patients with GIST: the Phase 1 study (DCC-2618 
01-001) in patients with solid tumours including a large proportion of patients with GIST, receiving 
ripretinib 150 mg QD as either 2nd line (N=31), 3rd line (N=28) or ≥4th line (N=83) treatment; the 
Phase 3 INVICTUS study in patients with GIST who received ripretinib or placebo for ≥4th line (the 
pivotal study in this application); and the Phase 3 INTRIGUE study evaluating ripretinib versus 
sunitinib in 2nd line (all ongoing). Study DCC-2618 01-001 also includes a serial PK cohort of up to 10 
patients with GIST and other solid tumours with renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL)) 20 to 
50 mL/min, not requiring dialysis), and is currently underway.

Four studies (2 completed, 2 ongoing) are included in this MAA. Two Phase 1 clinical pharmacology 
studies in healthy adult subjects have been completed and are submitted with this application. Two 
ongoing studies in patients with GIST form the primary basis for the evaluation of efficacy, safety, and 
PK for this submission (DCC-2618 01-001 and INVICTUS) with an initial cut-off date of 01 Mar 2019 
and 31 May 2019, respectively. An additional safety update to the data cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019 
(90-day) was performed for these 2 studies only, appended the present CSR. Furthermore, an 
additional efficacy and safety update with a data cut-off date of 10 Aug 2020 was performed for these 
2 studies; the final data from this data-cut off date is provided in the SmPC.  
Scientific advice from the CHMP, SAWP, has been sought related to both preclinical and clinical 
development of ripretinib, Feb. 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/3764/1/2018/PA/III), however, the clinical 
questions focused on the INTRIGUE study (DCC 2618 03 002), a single pivotal Phase 3 study in 
patients with second-line GIST (ongoing), not presented here. Furthermore, in Jan 2020, scientific 
advice was sought (EMEA/H/SA/3764/2/2020/PA/III), which concerned quality development, pre-
clinical development and clinical development. The only clinical question in this advice, however, 
concerned pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as tablets containing 50 mg of ripretinib as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: crospovidone (E1202), hypromellose acetate succinate, lactose monohydrate, 
magnesium stearate (E470b), microcrystalline cellulose (E460) and colloidal hydrated silica (E551).  
The product is available in white high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with an aluminium 
foil/polyethylene (PE) tamper evident seal and a white polypropylene (PP) child-resistant closure, 
together with one PE desiccant canister containing silica gel. Each bottle contains 30 or 90 tablets. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of ripretinib is 1-(4-Bromo-5-[1-ethyl-7-(methylamino)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,6-
naphthyridin-3-yl]-2-fluorophenyl)-3-phenylurea corresponding to the molecular formula 
C24H21BrFN5O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 510.36 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Ripretinib structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 16/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of ripretinib was elucidated by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry with confirmatory data from elemental analysis, Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by polymorph screening, dynamic vapor sorption, thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and solid form confirmation. 
The active substance is a white to off-white solid crystalline, an anhydrous, unsolvated crystal form. 
Ripretinib is practically insoluble in aqueous media at physiologic pH values, even in the presence of up 
to 2% of bile salts. A designation of BCS class 2 or 4 could be assigned based on the measured 
aqueous solubility combined with the available data on permeability and oral bioavailability in 
preclinical studies. 
Ripretinib has a non - chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed for ripretinib. A 
comprehensive and extensive polymorph screen was performed. Upon review of the potential forms 
identified, it was concluded that only a particular polymorph was relevant to the ripretinib 
manufacturing process. The selected polymorph is the more thermodynamically stable anhydrous form 
and was selected as the active substance form for the product. The presence of the desired polymorph 
is ensured through the manufacturing method of the active substance and controlled in the active 
substance release specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ripretinib is synthesized in three main stages using commercially available well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. One active substance manufacturer is proposed. 
The 3 synthetic stages of the manufacturing process are further divided into discrete “steps” equivalent 
to the unit operations. A high-level flow diagram for these individual steps and in-process controls 
(IPC) with acceptance criteria are adequately presented in the dossier. 
Conversion of starting materials into ripretinib active substance involves 3 chemical transformations 
and at least 5 crystallisations to generate the active substance. The reaction steps and isolations 
between starting materials and the final active substance have demonstrated adequate purging and 
control of impurities as shown by the available batch history data for ripretinib.  
Adequate IPCs are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of 
the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin, fate, purge and 
characterisation. Any impurity found above 0.1% in the active substance, in any intermediate or in the 
starting materials has been identified, isolated/synthesised and fully characterised. 
Five impurities are included in the proposed specification as specified identified impurities and nine 
additional potential impurities are identified and limited as unspecified identified impurities at the 
qualification threshold (0.15%); the proposed control strategy for each of them takes into 
consideration their origin and the material attributes and/process parameters that impact their 
presence. A summary of the toxicological qualification of the related substances limited at levels above 
the qualification threshold is provided; it is concluded that those impurities are considered qualified at 
the proposed specification limits in the active substance (see non-clinical section). Although ICH M7 
does not apply to this medicinal product because of its indication, an evaluation of the potential

genotoxic impurities has been provided and demonstrates that all specified impurities are Class 4 and 
designated as non-mutagenic. 
Residual solvents are controlled in the release specifications with limits according to ICH Q3C guideline. 
All the solvents used in the synthesis of the starting materials are controlled in the specifications of the 
respective starting material. The control strategy for the potential presence of benzene as contaminant 
in solvents used in the synthesis of the starting materials has been described. Benzene is controlled in 
the solvents and starting materials specifications, as required. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program using a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of 
Quality by Design (QbD), such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DoE) studies. A 
comprehensive tabular presentation of active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs) and the 
corresponding control strategy elements is provided in the dossier. No design space is claimed across 
the entire manufacturing process. 
Each step was subject to a risk assessment, that revealed several potential critical process parameters. 
Based on these studies, proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for several steps of the 
manufacturing process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs 
identified in each stage. 
Changes introduced during development have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. A single route of synthesis has been used for the production of all nonclinical, clinical, 
stability, and (pre)-validation and validation batches. This route has been optimised during 
development resulting in the current intended commercial manufacturing process. Process 
development optimizations include changes to the synthesis of starting materials (SMs), reagents, and 
solvents and revisions to process parameters settings allowing for improvements in yield, 
manufacturability, and control of relevant CQAs. The quality of the active substance used in the various 
phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed 
commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double linear LDPE bags which complies with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description (visual), identity (FTIR (ATR) - Ph. 
Eur.), assay, related substances (RP-UPLC), residual solvents ((HS-GC) Ph. Eur. 5.4), sulphated ash 
(residue on ignition – gravimetric method - Ph. Eur.), solid form confirmation (XRPD), water content 
(Karl Fischer, Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction - Ph. Eur.) and elemental impurities (ICP-MS, Ph. 
Eur.). 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance CQAs. The specification limits for 
the active substance are based on batch analyses of 3 batches of ripretinib active substance prepared 
by the commercial process, and batches used for clinical and toxicological studies, taking in 
consideration also the stability data.  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.

Based on the historical microbial enumeration data, coupled with the water activity data, microbial 
enumeration testing has not been included in the release specification, in line with ICH Q6A, Decision 
Tree #6. 
The control strategy for residual solvents has been detailed in the characterisation of the active 
substance section. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three primary registration batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package in a container closure system representative 
of that intended for the market for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release, with the addition of microbial enumeration. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications under long term and accelerated conditions.    
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No significant 
differences between the exposed and controlled samples for any of the parameters studied 
(appearance, assay and impurities) were observed; the active substance is considered photostable. 
Results on stress conditions were also provided on one batch exposed either as solid or as a 
solution/suspension preparation to light, heat, acid, base, and hydrogen peroxide. Significant 
degradation was achieved in acidic conditions, whilst a small increase in degradation products was 
observed under hydrogen peroxide and in basic conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Ripretinib tablets are white to off-white, approximately 9 × 17 mm, oval shaped tablets, debossed with 
‘DC1' on one side. The product is presented as white uncoated tablets of a single strength (50 mg). No 
overages are proposed. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the finished product is included 
in the dossier. 
Due to the low solubility of ripretinib active substance at physiologic pH and the low to moderate 
permeability, a finished product manufacturing process that enhanced the solubility and bioavailability 
of the micronised active substance was investigated during product development. This led to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 19/134 
 
 
 
 
development of a ripretinib finished product that incorporates the amorphous active substance in the 
form of a spray-dried intermediate (SDI). The SDI is subsequently blended with the remaining 
excipients, granulated through a roller compaction process, and compressed into the tablet. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) for ripretinib tablets was defined as 50 mg immediate release 
tablets for once daily administration. Key elements of the QTPP are provided in Table 4. 
Table 1: Ripretinib finished product quality target product profile 
CQAs for both the SDI and the tablets have been identified. The formulation development consisted of 
two main parts:  
1. development of the spray-dried intermediate, focusing on the assessment of the feasibility 
of producing an amorphous spray-dried intermediate, including identification of a suitable 
polymer, solvents, and drug loading;  
2. development of the tablet formulation, including identification of the optimum tablet 
excipients to convert the spray-dried intermediate into tablets that meet the ripretinib finished 
product CQAs and QTPP. 
The excipients selection has been adequately described, the function of the excipients, as well as the 
critical attributes that can influence the performance of the finished product, are detailed. Compatibility 
has been investigated through binary blends of the SDI and the excipients; no incompatibilities have 
been observed. No evidence of phase separation or crystallisation during manufacture or storage of 
ripretinib tablets has been observed. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their

quality is compliant with the Ph. Eur. with the exception of hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), 
a non-phthalate-containing, cellulosic-based polymer, which is described in NF and is commonly used 
in the manufacture of spray-dried dispersions. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The manufacturing process consists of two main stages: SDI preparation and tablet preparation (dry 
granulation and compression). The manufacturing process development has been evaluated through 
the use of risk assessment and DoE to identify the critical process parameters (CPPs). A risk analysis 
was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process 
steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. 
Identified risks were mitigated by targeted studies, equipment design, batch record instructions and 
IPCs. The CPPs have been adequately identified. No design spaces are claimed for the manufacturing 
process of the finished product.  
A comprehensive tabular presentation of finished product CQAs and the corresponding control strategy 
elements is provided in the dossier. 
Each stage was subject to a risk assessment, that revealed several potential CPPs. Based on these 
studies, PARs have been defined for several steps of the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs identified in each stage. During the 
procedure the applicant has confirmed that for each process step, only one process parameter at a 
time can be deliberately changed within its PAR while maintaining all other process parameters at their 
intended target or NOR, in line with ICH Q8 definition. 
The quality control (QC) dissolution method employs apparatus 2 (paddles) The speed of the paddle 
apparatus and the composition of the dissolution media have been adequately investigated and are 
considered justified. The discriminating ability of the dissolution method was demonstrated by 
manufacturing products with meaningful variations of the most relevant critical attributes found to 
impact in vitro release rate (e.g. crystallinity, disintegrant level, granule tensile strength, tablet 
compression force). 
Differences between the formulation used for clinical studies and the intended commercial formulation 
have been adequately justified. The two formulations are considered equivalent. The manufacturing 
site of the finished product has not changed throughout development. Only minor changes have been 
made to the commercial manufacturing process compared to that used for the clinical batches. 
A comparison of the in vitro dissolution profiles of clinical batches and the commercial registration 
batches using a model independent approach was performed. Bases on the f2 values,  in vitro 
similarity can be concluded for only two clinical batches when compared to the mean of the registration 
batches, BE study DCC-2618-01-002 (described in the clinical section of this report) supports that the 
clinical and commercial formulations can be considered bioequivalent based on the criteria presented in 
EMA’s “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence” CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr. These 
results further demonstrate the discriminatory capability of dissolution method and indicate that, in 
terms of clinical relevance, the method might be overly discriminating in terms of bioequivalence. 
Bulk tablets are stored in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, sealed with plastic ties. Silica 
gel desiccant is placed between the bags. The bags are put in a sealed aluminium bag which is placed 
in a HDPE drum. The commercial packaging consists of a primary packaging which is a white HDPE 
bottle with an aluminium foil/PE tamper evident seal and a white PP child-resistant closure, together 
with one PE desiccant canister containing silica gel.  
The contact materials of the bulk and commercial packaging comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The child-resistant closure is in compliance with ISO 8317:2015.

The choice of the container closure systems has been validated by stability data and is adequate for 
the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As indicated above, the manufacturing process consists of 2 main stages: manufacture of the SDI and 
manufacture of the tablet.  
In stage 1, ripretinib active substance is mixed with HPMCAS to produce an amorphous SDI. 
In stage 2, the SDI is combined with microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, crospovidone, 
silica colloidal hydrated, and magnesium stearate. The combined components are granulated using a 
roller compaction process and then blended with extragranular silica colloidal hydrated and magnesium 
stearate. The final blend is compressed into tablets containing 50 mg of ripretinib. 
A flow diagram for the finished product manufacturing process is provided in the dossier. 
Critical process parameters, including their proven acceptable ranges, targets and/or normal operating 
ranges as discussed previously were justified. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process. 
The spray-drying step is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing step. The SDI manufacturing 
process have been validated by manufacturing three consecutive batches of the SDI intermediate. A 
satisfactory validation protocol has been submitted. Through the batch data provided, it has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specification, includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual inspection), identification (HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV), degradation products 
(HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC-UV /Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC-UV /Ph. Eur.), water 
content (Karl Fischer - Ph. Eur), solid form XRPD (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specification tests are in line with ICHQ6A and Ph. Eur. requirements and suitable for an 
immediate release tablet. The limit for water content has been justified based on historical batch data 
at release, the maximum level observed during stability, and taking into consideration process and 
analytical variability.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for nine clinical batches and six commercial full-scale batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
The finished product is released to the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021

A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product of each pack size (bottles with 30 
and 90 tablets), obtained from three bulk tablets batches, stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of ripretinib finished product are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the shelf life specification which includes tests for: assay, specified, 
unspecified and total degradation products, dissolution, water content, solid form, and microbial 
quality. No significant changes can be observed and the only clear trend is the increase of the primary 
degradation product in the accelerated study. However, at six months, the limit is still within 
specification. The assay limit for the shelf-life specification was tightened during the procedure. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. In the light exposed open container, the tablets failed 
specification. Test conditions evaluating the closed container (both exposed and protected) exhibit 
passing results for all test attributes. These results confirm the suitability of the intended commercial 
primary package. 
Samples of the finished product were subjected to stress conditions (acid, base, oxidation, heat, heat 
and moisture combined, and exposure to light). Out of specification results were obtained after 
exposure to light. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
A bulk stability study has been conducted on two bulk tablet batches stored for up to 6 months at 20 
°C to 25 °C in the proposed bulk container closure system. The data supports a maximum storage of 6 
months (excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C) for the bulk tablets before packaging in the final 
primary container for marketing. 
An in-use stability study, simulating the in-use conditions and stored at under long term conditions 
(2ºC / 60% RH) for up to 30 days has been conducted on two primary batches packed in both pack 
sizes (bottles for 30 and 90 tablets). Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, 
dissolution and solid form, according to shelf-life specifications and analytical procedures; the data 
supports the 30 day in-use period when the product is stored according to the label. No in-use period 
restriction is therefore proposed. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions “Store in 
the original package and keep bottle tightly closed in order to protect from light and moisture” as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. No other raw materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of ripretinib 
active substance or finished product. Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Due to the low solubility of ripretinib a SDI that incorporates 
an amorphous form of the active substance and enhances its bioavailability was developed. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Ripretinib is a novel, oral inhibitor of KIT kinase, developed by Deciphera, using its proprietary kinase 
switch control inhibitor technology platform. The objective of the program was to develop a substance 
binding to a broad range of constitutively active KIT mutant kinase forms and induce them to adopt 
inactive conformations. 
Primary pharmodynamics 
Ripretinib and the active metabolite DP-5439 were shown to be potent inhibitors of KIT and PDGFRA 
kinases in vitro. Ripretinib and DP-5439 demonstrated inhibition of these kinases in both recombinant 
enzyme and cell-based assays. In a study with a large number of clinically relevant KIT mutants, the 
inhibitory activity of ripretinib and DP-5439 was compared to the approved KIT inhibitors imatinib, 
sunitinib and regorafenib.

Ripretinib and DP-5439 blocked cellular proliferation or KIT/PDGFRA phosphorylation of GIST, AML, and 
mastocytosis cell lines driven by KIT mutations, induced apoptosis in KIT mutant mast cells and 
prevented the emergence of drug resistance in KIT mutant cellular saturation mutagenesis assays. In 
cellular assays, ripretinib and DP-5439 also inhibited several key kinases that play important roles in 
the tumour microenvironment, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), 
colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), PDGFRB, and tunica interna endothelial kinase 2 (TIE2). 
In vivo, ripretinib inhibited mutant KIT phosphorylation and signaling in PK/PD xenograft models. 
In vivo inhibition of KIT was associated with inhibition of tumour growth in a variety of tumour 
xenograft models including exon 11 mutant KIT GIST T1 xenografts and an imatinib-resistant exon 17 
mutant KIT GIST patient-derived xenograft. Ripretinib treatment also led to complete tumour 
regression in the H1703 PDGFRA-amplified lung cancer xenograft model. Ripretinib treatment was well 
tolerated in mouse studies, with a maximum tolerated dose ≥180 mg/kg twice daily. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In a large panel of 295 human kinase activity assays, ripretinib was found to inhibit 19 kinases within 
10-fold of its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for KIT inhibition, inclusive of primary 
targets VEGFR2 (KDR), PDGFRA/B, and CSF-1R (FMS). Ripretinib showed > 10-fold specificity versus 
273 other kinases and > 50-fold specificity versus 256 of the kinases in the panel. Many kinases 
identified to be inhibited within 10-fold of KIT in the large panel study utilizing a low 10 μM adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) concentration were found to be much less inhibited when evaluated at relevant 
cellular levels of ATP (4 mM). Cellular studies revealed that ripretinib functionally inhibited kinases 
including TIE2, CSF-1R, PDGFRA/B, and VEGFR2, but showed weak activity for cellular RAF kinases.

Page 25/134 
 
 
 
 
Ripretinib was also evaluated versus a battery of 135 receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. Screening 
at a concentration of 10 μM did not identify any significant liabilities that precluded development. 
Safety pharmacology 
Ripretinib showed no CNS or respiratory effects when administered orally to Sprague-Dawley rats at 
15, 60 or 300 mg/kg. he approximate maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) in these studies was 
expected to be 3460 ng/mL and the expected area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 
from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) was 36300 ng∙h/mL at 300 mg/kg based on Day 1 toxicokinetic 
results from the 4-week toxicity study in male rats. 
For CV assessment, the Predictor™ hERG Fluorescence Polarization Assay by Invitrogen was used to 
assess hERG channel binding potential in a homogenous, fluorescence polarization-based format. The 
average hERG IC50/concentration required to achieve 20% inhibition (IC20) values were 7.9 μM/2.0 μM 
for ripretinib and 2.5 μM/0.41 μM for DP-5439. 
Ripretinib had no effect on CNS and respiratory systems. Single doses of ripretinib resulted in 
increased diastolic pressure and mean arterial pressure in a CV safety study. There were no changes to 
systolic pressures or arterial pulse pressure. Increases in HR and lower QT and PR interval (likely 
secondary to changes in HR) were observed, but there was no change in QTc values. The magnitudes 
of the blood pressure and HR changes were considered noteworthy, but do not represent a severe 
toxicity. In vitro, ripretinib and metabolite DP-5439 exhibited weak binding to hERG channel 
components. 
The telemetry dog study  showed ripretinib-related CV changes with a marked increase in HR (up to 
129% at 75 mg/kg) with secondary decreases in QT and PR interval in animals given ≥ 7 mg/kg from 
9 hours post dose through 19 hours post dose, and increased diastolic and mean arterial pressure in 
animals given ≥ 7 mg/kg through 6 hours post dose. QTc values were not significantly increased with 
ripretinib treatment. HRs remained elevated at the end of the telemetry collection (19 hours post 
dose), but differences were slightly less suggesting that HRs were beginning to recover at 19 hours 
post dose. Animals given 7, 20, and 75 mg/kg had plasma concentrations (mean ± standard deviation) 
of 212 ± 80, 284 ± 131, and 586 ± 222 ng/mL, respectively. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) 
bioanalytical methods were developed and fully validated in rat and dog plasma. These assays were 
used to support the GLP toxicokinetic studies in the rat and dog. 
Absorption 
The PK of ripretinib was assessed after a single IV bolus dose or oral doses in mice, rats, dogs, and 
cynomolgus monkeys. A multidose oral PK study was performed in dogs. In rats, the unformulated 
mesylate salt of ripretinib (DP-4851.M) exhibited 28% bioavailability, an IV elimination half-life of 2.0 
hours, and an IV clearance rate (Cl_obs) of 0.64 L/h/kg. The volume of distribution (Vz_obs) was 
1.87 L/kg. In dogs, ripretinib (DP-4851.M) exhibited 24% bioavailability, an IV elimination half-life of 
2.72 hours, a low Cl_obs of 0.27 L/h/kg, and a Vz_obs of 1.03 L/kg. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of ripretinib was investigated in mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and 
human plasma. Percent bound values were approximately 99.9% in all species. Ripretinib was 
moderately bound to blood cell components, but primarily partitioned to plasma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 26/134 
 
 
 
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography tissue distribution of [14C] -ripretinib (~100 µCi/kg) was 
assessed in SD rats and pigmented Long Evans (LE) rats. Radiolabel associated with [14C]-ripretinib 
was extensively bound to melanin-containing tissues in pigmented LE rats such as eye ciliary body, eye 
uveal tract, and eyes, and the radiolabel binding showed a long half-life. In non-pigmented SD rats, 
binding to these regions was minor. The distribution in plasma, liver, and kidney in SD rats show half-
lives of 4.4 hours, 11.7 hours, and 13.6 hours. Similarly, in the LE rat, the distribution in plasma, liver, 
and kidney show half-lives of 4.2 hours, 10.7 hours, and 12.6 hours, respectively. 
In an in vivo distribution study, SD rats were assessed for the uptake of ripretinib into the brain 
following a 0.9 mg/kg IV dose. Plasma and brain samples taken over 24-hour time points post dose 
show presence of ripretinib and its metabolite DP-5439 in plasma at levels similar to those observed in 
previous IV dose studies. Analysis of brain samples demonstrated that ripretinib exposures for Cmax 
and AUC were 3.6% and 2.2% respectively, relative to the levels in plasma. No measurable levels of 
metabolite DP-5439 were present in the brain tissue. 
Metabolism 
The overall extent of ripretinib metabolism by hepatocytes from highest to lowest followed the rank 
order monkey > dog > rat > mouse ≈ human. The metabolic pathways of ripretinib were qualitatively 
similar across all five species and resulting in no human-specific or human-disproportionate 
metabolites. 
In vivo metabolism studies conducted with [14C]-radiolabeled ripretinib in SD rats and in beagle dogs 
show the presence of same ripretinib metabolites at similar plasma concentrations relative to in vitro 
studies. In a rat mass balance study, pooled composite plasma samples from SD rats profiled 
contained nine radioactive components. Unchanged ripretinib was the major circulating component in 
male and female rats and accounted for approximately 51% and 71% of the total radioactivity 
exposure, respectively. N-desmethylated metabolite DP-5439 (M5) was the major circulating 
metabolite and accounted for approximately 38% and 22% of the total radioactivity exposure in males 
and females, respectively. Similarly, in the dog mass balance study, pooled composite plasma samples 
profiled contained four radioactive components. Of the total radioactivity in the sample, unchanged 
ripretinib represented approximately 69% and DP-5439 represented approximately 22% in both males 
and females. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology profile of ripretinib (DCC 2618) has been evaluated in rats, rabbits, and 
dogs in agreement with relevant guidelines. 
The oral route of administration was utilized in all pivotal toxicology studies to match the intended 
clinical administration route. 
The treatment with ripretinib should continue as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable 
toxicity. In accordance with the ICH S9 guideline for anticancer pharmaceutical for patients with 
advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months duration are considered sufficient to support 
marketing. The pivotal studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
In the ripretinib toxicology program, rats and dogs were selected as the primary test species for 
general toxicity studies.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies have been performed. This is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 27/134 
 
 
 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Ripretinib was evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs (14 days, 4 weeks with 4 
weeks recovery, 13 weeks with 4 weeks recovery).  
The most pronounced effects were inflammatory responses correlating with skin changes, elevated 
hepatic enzyme activity and gastrointestinal effects. 
Morbidity and mortality 
Ripretinib was not tolerated in rats and dogs at high doses. In rats, the highest tested dose, 300 
mg/kg/day, was tolerated in the short-term studies. In the 3-months study however, three animals 
administered 300 mg/kg were sacrificed in moribund condition on day 22 and 29 of treatment. The 
animals had discoloured skin, scabs on the tail and/or feet, scaly skin on the tail and thinning of the 
hair coat. One of the animals was also evaluated microscopically and was observed with marked 
haemorrhage and neutrophilic inflammation of the urinary bladder with likely extension into the 
kidney. Several of the remaining animals in the 300 mg/kg group was administered NSAID due to the 
lesions in the skin. 
In dogs, in the non-pivotal study 1 (of 2) male was sacrificed after 5 doses of DCC-2618. This animal 
exhibited repeated emesis which lead to lethargy, dehydration, intermittent tremors and marked 
decreases in electrolytes. In the 4 weeks study, dosing was suspended on day 8-14 in several animals 
of the 20 and 75 mg/kg groups. Dose-limiting toxicity effects included severe skin reactions that 
manifested as red, dry, scaly, and/or flaky skin of the feet, ears, swollen muzzle, periorbital area, 
inguinal area, and/or ventral thoracic area; ear discharge; and thinning of the hair coat, with 
microscopic findings of hyperkeratosis. These changes were progressive, were dose-related in severity, 
and warranted suspension of dosing and/or early termination of animals at 20 and 75 mg/kg/day. In 
the 13-week study, 1 female in the 10 mg/kg group was sacrificed in a moribund condition on Day 23. 
It is likely that it was a pre-existing weakened state that was exacerbated by the test article that led to 
the moribund state. 
Body weight & food consumption 
Administration with ripretinib was associated with decreased body weight. The decreased body weight 
was observed also during recovery and were preceded by the lowered food consumption. During the 
13-weeks studies animals were supplemented with DietGel (rats in 300 mg/kg) and canned food 
(individuals in 5 and 10 mg/kg groups). 
Skin 
Lesions of the skin and related observations were very common and also led to the early sacrifice of 
animals as discussed above. Furthermore, animals were treated with NSAID, antibiotics and silver 
sulfadiazine cream for the red and thickened skin, scabs and sores and pruritus. 
In the 13 week study in rats discoloured skin, and skin lesions at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day; alopecia or thinning 
hair coat were noted. These findings correlated with clinical pathology findings indicating an 
inflammatory and/or a stress response that correlated with skin changes. The histopathological 
investigation revealed hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the skin/subcutis in all dose groups. The 
observation was only partially reversible. 
In the pivotal 4-week study in dogs, ripretinib at doses of 20 and 75 mg/kg resulted in serious skin 
changes requiring discontinuation of dosing and/or early sacrifice (see section on mortality above). 
Hyperkeratosis of the skin was observed in the histopathological evaluation.  
In the 13-weeks study in dogs, daily administration of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day ripretinib resulted in 
skin lesions and thinning hair coat/hair loss at all doses, and the skin feeling warm to the touch at ≥ 5 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 28/134 
 
 
 
mg/kg/day Clinical pathology findings were consistent with an inflammatory and/or stress response. 
Microscopic findings of hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis in the skin were observed. 
Alopecia, palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, and dry skin are listed as very common 
adverse drug reactions in patients. Pruritus, dermatitis acneiform, hyperkeratosis, and rash 
maculopapula as common. The exact mechanism behind the findings in the skin is not understood. 
However, since skin disorders are commonly observed in patients, and also easily monitored, the 
mechanism is not considered crucial for safety assessment of ripretinib. Nevertheless, as discussed 
above, the applicant is asked to further discuss the skin findings in relation to the acute toxicity that 
lead to the preterm sacrifice of several animals. 
Lymphoid tissues and immune system 
The increased number of leukocytes (WBC, NEU, MON, EOS, Large unstained cell, BAS) and PLT and 
higher fibrinogen concentration in the 13-weeks repeat dose study in rats were suggestive of an 
inflammatory response. This finding correlated with the macroscopic and microscopic findings in the 
skin. The inflammatory reactions were also seen in the minimally to mildly lower protein and albumin 
concentrations and albumin:globulin ratio  
In the dog studies an increase in white blood cells, platelets, and fibrinogen were also seen. The weight 
of the thymus was reduced which correlated with the decreased number of lymphocytes observed 
microscopically. No effect on thymus was not observed in the 13-week study. 
Hematology 
In rats treated with ripretinib, lower red cell mass (RBC, HGB, HCT) was accompanied by a 
regenerative response, as supported by the higher reticulocyte count and changes to red blood cell 
indices (MCV, MHC, RBC width). These red blood findings did not have clinical or microscopic correlates 
and were of unclear mechanism. 
Cardiovascular 
In the 14 day dose-range finding study in rats, potentially ripretinib related microscopic heart changes 
were identified. In the longer GLP-compliant studies no cardiac injury was observed. 
In the 13-week study in rats, ripretinib-related minimal to moderate hypertrophy/hyperplasia of blood 
vessels occurred in the liver, lungs, and/or mesenteric lymph node of dosing phase animals 
administered ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. Hypertrophy/hyperplasia of vessels generally decreased in incidence 
and/or severity in recovery sacrifice animals administered ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, which suggested partial 
reversibility. 
Liver 
In rats exposed to ripretinib for 13 weeks, increased hepatic enzyme activities (ALT and/or ALP) was 
observed. These findings correlated with changes in the portal vasculature in the liver. The 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the vessels was most pronounced in male rats. 
In the 4-weeks study in the dog, ALT was reduced. The liver weight was however increased in male 
animals administered 75 mg/kg and in one female animal in the 20 mg/kg group. The increased weight 
correlated with cytoplasmic rarefaction of hepatocytes. In the 13-week study in dogs (with lower doses 
administered) no observations suggestive of liver toxicity was noted. 
Gastrointestinal 
In rat diffuse hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis in the non-glandular stomach was noted in both the 4- weeks 
and 13-weeks studies. This was only partially reversed during the recovery phase. In the longer study, 
hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis was observed also in the skin/subcutis, tongue and esophagus. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 29/134 
 
 
 
The non-glandular stomach of rodents serves as a storage organ and is not present in humans. The 
clinical relevance of findings in the non glandular stomach could thus be questioned although it is likely 
that the squamous mucosa lining in the esophagus in species without a forestomach would react 
similar as the forestomach if the exposure would be equivalent. In the rodent, it is possible that the 
exposure time to the mucosa is prolonged due to residual ripretinib in the forestomach. In the patients, 
ripretinib is administered in tablets and it is therefore not likely that the mucosa of the human 
esophagus would be exposed for a prolonged time. No study of the local tolerance of ripretinib has 
however been conducted. 
In the rat, marked degeneration of Brunner’s glands in the proximal duodenum was noted. 
In dogs, ripretinib common clinical signs were generally indicative of gastrointestinal effects (emesis 
and/or abnormal feces). 
Teeth 
Missing or white teeth were observed in the 13-week rat study. During the recovery phase, this 
observation was noted in animals not previously observed with the findings. The microscopic 
evaluation showed minimal to marked degeneration of incisor teeth. Loss and/or disorganization of 
odontogenic cells, changes in dentin. The upper molars were found unaffected. No effects on teeth 
were observed in the dog studies. 
Skeletal 
Ripretinib-related increased osteoblastic surface and/or decreased trabeculae of the femur occurred in 
dosing phase animals administered ≥ 30 mg/kg/day in the 13-weeks rat study. These findings 
generally decreased in incidence and/or severity in recovery sacrifice animals which suggested partial 
reversibility. No observations were made in the dog studies. 
Reproductive organs 
In the 13-week study in rats, increased incidences of mononuclear infiltration and cellular debris 
occurred in the epididymides and had not resolved by the end of a 4-week recovery period. Tubular 
atrophy and degeneration of the testes, as well as atrophy of the seminal vesicles, were observed at 
the end of the 4-week recovery period. Since the recovery period was 28 days and the spermatogenic 
cycle in rats is approximately 52 days, reversibility might not be expected. The histopathologic findings 
in male reproductive tissues of rats treated with ripretinib suggest a potential effect on fertility in 
humans, as seen with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. No histopathological findings were observed in 
the female reproductive tissue. 
Pulmonary system 
In rats, increased absolute and relative lung weights with no correlating microscopic findings was 
observed in the 4 weeks study. In the longer study, hypertrophy and hyperplasia and/or slight 
vacuolation of bronchiolar epithelium was observed. No effects on the pulmonary system were 
observed in the dog studies. The cause of these findings and the clinical relevance is not known. 
Interestingly, a very common adverse reaction in the patients was dyspnoea. No effects on respiratory 
parameters were observed in the safety pharmacology study, in which only one dose of ripretinib was 
administered. Thus, safety pharmacology studies does not reflect the situation after chronic treatment. 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetics of ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439 were characterized in all the pivotal 
repeat dose toxicity studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 30/134 
 
 
 
Female rats had approximately 2-fold higher exposure than males for ripretinib. The exposure of the 
metabolite was similar in male and female rats. No sex-dependent difference in exposure was observed 
in dogs. 
Exposures in rats and dogs were in general less than dose proportionate.  
Exposures were lower on the last day of the study than on Day 1. There was no evidence of 
accumulation of ripretinib after multiple dosing of ripretinib in rats. 
Exposure margins between the NOAEL and patient exposures were below 1. The same is in general 
true for margins to exposure at maximal tolerated dose. The rat exposure margins were slightly larger 
than when comparing exposure in dogs vs patients. 
Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with the ICH S2 (R1) guideline, including 
tests for gene mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes, micronuclei and 
comet assay in vivo (rat), has been performed with ripretinib and the metabolite DP-5439. 
Both ripretinib and DP-5439 were found negative in the bacterial mutation assay.  
Ripretinib, but not DP-5439, was found positive in the in vitro micronucleus assay using human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
In the in vivo micronucleus assay, ripretinib did not induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes 
of the bone marrow. Furthermore, no DNA strand breaks were observed in the liver in the comet 
assay.  
Systemic exposure and presence of the metabolite were confirmed in the in vivo study. The bone 
marrow is a well perfused tissue and levels of drug related materials in blood or plasma are generally 
similar to those observed in bone marrow. The liver is expected to be exposed for drugs with systemic 
exposure. 
The negative results in the in vivo assays are considered sufficient to demonstrate the absence of 
significant genotoxic risk.  
Carcinogenicity  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ripretinib. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A reproductive toxicity program concerning the embryofetal toxicology assessment was performed with 
ripretinib. The conducted studies included dose-range finding embryo-foetal development studies in 
rats and rabbits and a pivotal embryo-foetal development study in rats. 
The pivotal study is stated to be GLP-compliant. The reproductive toxicity program is in accordance 
with ICH S9 guideline which states that studies on fertility and early embryonic development, and pre- 
and postnatal toxicology studies are generally not warranted to support marketing of pharmaceuticals 
for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. The study package is thus in general considered 
adequate and relevant for evaluation of potential risks for humans. 
Male and female fertility 
No fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted with ripretinib. 
According to ICH S9, a study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support 
the marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021

from general toxicity studies on the effect on reproductive organs should be used for the assessment 
of impairment of fertility. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Embryo-foetal development was investigated in rats and rabbits. Dose range finding studies were 
conducted in both species.  
In the DRF study in rats, ripretinib was administered at doses up to 300 mg/kg during the period of 
organogenesis (GD6-17). The two highest doses, 300 and 75 mg/kg, induced total litter loss due to 
early resorptions. In the highest dose with surviving foetuses (20 mg/kg) external anomalies were 
observed in the foetuses. The 20 mg/kg dose was selected as the high dose in the pivotal study.  
DCC-2618 related developmental toxicity, characterized by malformations and variations, primarily of 
the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, was observed at 20 mg/kg. Skeletal variations were also 
observed in the 5 mg/kg group and are considered related to exposure of DCC-2618. The NOAEL 
proposed by the applicant, 5 mg/kg, was thus not accepted but lowered to 1 mg/kg. 
The exposure margins at GD11 at NOAEL (1 mg/kg) vs exposure in humans are 184/9856= 0.02 for 
DCC-2618. The concentration of the metabolite at this dose was not detectable. Teratogenicity 
observed as malformations, was observed at 20 mg/kg, with the exposure margins at GD11 of 
9410/9856= 1 and 888/8146=0.1 for DCC-2618 and DP-5439 respectively. 
A DRF study was also conducted in rabbits. In this study ripretinib was administered at doses up to 
150 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis (GD7-19). The highest dose, 150 mg/kg, induced total 
litter loss due to early resorptions. Embryonic survival was also reduced in the 40 mg/kg group.  
In the 40 mg/kg, anomalies were observed in one fetus. The applicant claims that these anomalies are 
unrelated to administration of ripretinib. This is not agreed upon. It is not possible to exclude that the 
findings were caused by ripretinib from a dose-range finding study with limited number of treated 
animals. This claim would need to be supported by a pivotal study showing absence of the findings. As 
commented above, a pivotal study in rabbits is however not considered warranted. 
The exposure margins at GD13 in the lowest dose group (2 mg/kg) in which decreased maternal body 
weight gain was observed vs exposure in humans are 1640/9856= 0.2 and 88.9/8146=0.01 for DCC-
2618 and DP-5439 respectively. Embryonic lethality occurred at 40 mg/kg, with the exposure margins 
at GD13 of 48900/9856= 5 and 5910/8146=0.7 for DCC-2618 and DP-5439 respectively. 
No pre- and postnatal development studies or juvenile animal studies were conducted. 
Teratogenicity and developmental toxicity have been reported in rats and/or rabbits with other tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors. Many of these effects were related to delays in skeletal ossification and occurred at a 
dose that resulted in reduced fetal body weights and skeletal malformations. These effects are not 
unexpected given the role of tyrosine kinases in fetal development.  
Metabolites  
No specific studies with metabolites have been conducted. The exposure of the metabolite DP-5429 
was measured in all the pivotal toxicity studies. The data indicates adequate exposure of the 
metabolite.  
Impurities 
Three impurities in the drug substance specification are specified above the ICH Q3A Impurities in New 
Drug Substances qualification threshold of 0.15% and one drug product degradant.

DP-4847 is specified above the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q3B(R2), Impurities 
in New Drug Products.. 
Rat and dog toxicity studies were used to calculate exposure margins. The test material used in the 13 
week studies were exposed to accelerated aging (50◦C/75% RH, open) for 3-4 weeks. The impurities 
can be considered adequately qualified at the proposed specification limits. 
Phototoxicity 
Ripretinib absorbs light within the range of natural sunlight, with a molar extinction coefficient >1000 
M-1cm-1 between 290 and 700 nm. In other words, ripretinib has a photoreactive potential. 
Ripretinib and the active metabolite DP-5439 were investigated in the 3T3 NRU assay. Both substances 
demonstrated phototoxic potential in the assay.  
As described in the section on pharmacokinetics, ripretinib was shown to be highly bound to melanin-
containing tissues.  
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT), the applicant provided a Log P 
value of 3.69. The value was determined by microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) 
using capillary electrophoresis. Since this method is not a preferred method according to the current 
guideline the applicant should determine the logKow experimentally according to the current ERA 
guideline. The applicant has agreed to conduct a study to determine the logKow experimentally and 
states the study report will be submitted in March 2023 (see post authorisation measures section-
REC). The log Kow is pending, and thus also the PBT assessment. 
The Phase I exposure assessment the Fpen was refined. Using the prevalence data used in the Orphan 
Designation renders a PECSW that triggers a Phase II assessment (0.012 µg/L). The applicant has 
however provided an alternative approach in which the action limit for Phase II is not reached. A 
refined Fpen is presented with worst case scenarios for the GIST patients actually eligible for treatment 
with ripretinib, taking into consideration that ripretinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
advanced GIST who have received at three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. Also the mean 
length of the treatment was included in the refinement (36 weeks). This rendered a Fpen refined of 
0.00013, which resulted in a PECsurfacewater of 0.0098 µg/L. Nota bene, the mean duration of a 
treatment period and not the worst case period, was used in this calculation. In discussions with EMA 
the applicant has received the advice “The argument based on the fact that GIST is in 3rd or 4th line of 
treatment and that the prevalence of patients concerned would even be lower than the one used in 
their calculation is a possibility, but the applicant needs to provide published data to demonstrate 
that.”  
The applicant’s refinement of the Fpen is considered acceptable. The PECSW will thus be below the 
trigger value for a Phase II assessment. The applicant should note that future variations of the 
indication is likely to shift the PECSW to reach the action limit for entering Phase II assessment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Ripretinib and the main metabolite Dp-5439 are inhibitors of KIT and PDGFRA kinases with IC50 below 
10 nM for the WT kinases. Ripretinib shows activity at a large number of mutant KIT forms, many of 
which are associated with resistance to the previously approved KIT inhibitors imatinib, sunitinib and 
regorafenib. In an in vitro model for tolerance development based on chemical mutagenesis and cell 
culture in presence of ripretinib, no secondary KIT mutations resistant to ripretinib developed. In 
contrast, on culture with imatinib outgrowth with a number of KIT mutated clones occurred. For both 
substances there were occurrences of outgrowth with clones which showed no mutations KIT, likely 
due to activation of other oncogenic pathways. These data could suggest that ripretinib would be less 
likely to be associated with primary and secondary resistance than the approved KIT inhibitors. 
No data are presented on isolated KIT from toxicology species (rat, dog) to allow for a conclusion on 
the pharmacological relevance of these species. However, among the cell lines tested P815, a mouse 
cell line with a mutated KIT, showed a similar response as the human cell lines. A sequence 
comparison shows 94.3% identity between mouse and human in the the KIT kinase domain. For rat 
and dog the homology to human KIT is 94.8 and 98.6 %, respectively. The differences are located at 
positions unlikely to influence the activity of ripretinib. Considering the presence of toxicology findings 
in rat and dog which are likely to be due to on-target effects, it is agreed that rat and dog are 
pharmacologically relevant species for toxicity evaluation. 
In addition to KIT, ripretinib has relevant activity at a number of close related kinases. While some of 
these kinases were shown to provide anti-tumour activity through their importance for the tumour 
microenvironment (VEGFR2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB; TIE), these kinases are also of importance for normal 
tissue function and likely to be of importance for the safety profile. 
Ripretinib showed no liability for hERG inhibition in an in vitro study. In the dog cardiovascular safety 
study, increased heart rate and blood pressure was observed. There were no findings suggesting an

arrhythmic potential. Exposure at the high dose 75 mg/kg was 586 ng/ml. This is about equal to 
human Cmax (761 ng/ml).  
Rat safety pharmacology studies on CNS and respiratory effects did not demonstrate any safety 
concerns of clinical importance. No TK data were collected in these studies but based on data from the 
4-week rat toxicity studies a Cmax of 3460 ng/ml was expected at the high dose of 300 mg/kg. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Validated methods were established for measurement of ripretinib and the main metabolite DP-5439 in 
toxicity species. 
Absorption was adequately characterised in animals. 
The applicant performed dedicated studies to investigate the distribution to the brain in mice and rats. 
These studies showed minimal distribution of ripretinib and the main metabolite DP-5439 to the brain 
(<4%). While tumour metastises localizing to the brain may impair the blood-brain barrier, these data 
suggest ripretinib not be an effective drug in the cases. 
In the QWBA study, binding to melanin and retention in tissues such as eye ciliary body, eye uveal 
tract and eyes was identified. Ripretinib has showed phototoxic potential and this is issue to be 
considered for the clinical safety evaluation (see Toxicology section). 
The metabolism was evaluated in mass balance studies in rats and dogs. In both species, ripretinib 
was the major circulating form and the pharmacologically active metabolite DP-5439 was the main 
metabolite with AUC values 40-60% of the parent. DP-5439 is also the only main metabolite identified 
in humans. 
Toxicology 
The rat and dog were selected as primary test species for general toxicity studies. The justification for 
the relevance of these test species includes: in vitro studies of metabolic stability and metabolite 
identification comparing mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human, where rat and/or dog were 
demonstrated to form the same metabolites as humans. While there are no data on primary 
pharmacology in rats or dogs, strong sequence homology in critical parts of the KIT molecule suggests 
these animal models to be pharmacologically relevant. 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies, high doses of ripretinib were not tolerated and both rats and dogs 
were sacrificed early. The animals that was sacrificed early suffered from severe lesions and signs of 
inflammation. The cause of the acute toxicity was however initially only briefly discussed. Upon request 
the applicant further discussed the acute toxicity and possible mechanisms. Inflammation and 
reactions in the skin are evident in both rat and dog. The mechanism underlying these effects is 
unknown. A comparison with other similar substances indicates that other kinases related to the MAPK 
pathway and angiogenesis may be involved. Furthermore, skin findings in patients treated with 
ripretinib are common. The mechanism remains unclear but is not at this point further pursued. 
The applicant has defined the toxicological profile of ripretinib in the repeat dose toxicity studies, which 
in the case of rat species, skin, hair or teeth were identified as target organs. Also, an increase in lung 
weight, especially in females was reported. According to the applicant this is likely an effect of 
ripretinib on PDGFR. PDGFR inhibition has been described to affect fluid retention and patients 
receiving PDGFR inhibitors can develop oedema. The differences observed between male and female 
animals may be due to different levels of metabolizing enzymes resulting in higher plasma exposures 
in females.  
The microscopic evaluation of the rodent teeth showed minimal to marked degeneration of incisor 
teeth and loss and/or disorganization of odontogenic cells, changes in dentin. Rodent incisors continue 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 35/134 
 
 
 
to grow and differentiate throughout life and is renewed every 40-50 days. Rodent molars grow only 
little. Thus, the effect on non-growing teeth as in adult patients is most probably limited. The 
ripretinib-related increased osteoblastic surface and/or decreased trabeculae of the femur observed in 
rat is also of limited relevance for adult patients since the rodent bone continues to grow into 
adulthood. However, if treatment is considered for younger patients, the possible effect on teeth and 
growing bone needs to be taken into consideration.  
Values for systemic exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 150 mg ripretinib was initially 
presented as AUC0-12 h 5678 ng*h/mL for ripretinib and 7138 ng*h/mL for the metabolite DP-5439. 
The provided calculations were not agreed upon. It should be noted that the exposure margins should 
be calculated based on the total daily exposure, not on AUC0-12 h as has been done. In the non-
clinical assessment the AUC inf values from the single dose study (DCC-2618-01-002) are used (by the 
CHMP) for the calculations of exposure margins. During the first round of the procedure the applicant 
updated the values used for exposure margin calculations as well as the exposure margins. The 
updated values were based on AUC0-inf and resulted in 9856 and 8146 ng•h/mL for ripretinib and DP-
5439, respectively. The revised margins did not change the conclusion that exposure margins between 
NOAEL and patient exposures were below 1. 
It is noted that ripretinib displays a more limited nonclinical safety profile in comparison to other TKIs 
approved for GIST for which e.g. kidney, gastrointestinal and bone marrow effects are commonly seen. 
Upon request the applicant discussed this further and presented a summary of non-clinical safety 
findings for the previously approved TKIs for GIST; avapritinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. It 
is agreed that the skin reactions in dogs treated with ripretinib might be the reason for the more 
limited nonclinical safety profile of ripretinib in dogs than with other approved TKIs. A better 
comparison between the different TKIs would demand exposure data, which is not publicly available for 
all the TKIs. Thus, it is possible that the severe dose limiting dermal effects hampers the identification 
of toxicity that could have occurred at higher doses. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with ripretinib. New primary malignancies; cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CuSCC), was 
reported in patients treated with ripretinib. Squamous cell carcinoma of skin is classified as an 
important identified risk in the RMP. CuSCC is also included in the proposed SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. 
The lack of carcinogenicity studies is acceptable and according to the ICH S9 guideline. It is stated in 
the SmPC section 5.3 that no carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
No fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted with ripretinib. The lack of 
dedicated studies on fertility and early embryonic development is acceptable. However, in the 13 
weeks repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, minimal to marked bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the 
testis and increased cellular debris of the epididymis was observed in male rats administered ripretinib 
30 and 300 mg/kg/day with no apparent reversibility. Since the recovery period was 28 days and the 
spermatogenic cycle in rats is approximately 52 days, reversibility might not be expected. In response 
to a question in the first round of the procedure, the applicant further discussed the findings in male 
reproductive tissues in rats treated with ripretinib. In studies with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
similar findings have been observed. The specific mechanism of action has however not been 
investigated. A plausible explanation however is an on-target effect associated with inhibition of the 
tyrosine receptor kinase KIT. KIT signalling plays an important role in controlling cell proliferation, 
differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. Attenuation of its signalling strength has been linked to human 
male infertility (Sandlow et al. 1996), which is not unexpected since cell survival and proliferation are 
essential for the production of male germ cells (Cardoso et al. 2014). c-KIT is expressed in male germ 
cells during all stages of spermatogenesis, including post-testicular events related to sperm 
maturation. No treatment-related effects of ripretinib was seen on the female reproductive tissues. In 
the other approved TKIs such effects have been observed. The applicant’s conclusion; that the risks to 
female fertility resulting from treatment with ripretinib cannot be completely ruled out, is agreed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 36/134 
 
 
 
Taken together, the data suggests a potential adverse effect on fertility in patients. This is included in 
the SmPC section 4.6.  
Regarding the product information on pregnancy and lactation (section 4.6). The applicant has 
provided a justification regarding the duration of which effective contraception should be used after the 
final dose of ripretinib. The proposed duration is one week, and it is based on the t1/2 of ripretinib (15 
h) and DP-5439 (18 h). Thus, the one week is deemed as a sufficient duration. 
The applicant had also proposed a recommendation given to treated men with partners of reproductive 
potential, to use effective contraception. The applicant has provided no data or discussion if this 
recommendation is based on possible effects on the sperm quality or if it is based on possible transfer 
of ripretinib to the female partner via semen. However, based on the proposed duration of 
contraception after the last dose (1 w) which covers 5 half-lives of ripretinib the CHMP’s interpretation 
is that the purpose of recommendation is a precautionary measure to minimize risk for exposure to a 
female partner and importantly a potential embryo/fetus via semen.  Given the teratogenic and 
embryotoxic potential of ripretinib this could be acceptable. Yet, in many cases the risk for significant 
exposure via semen is low and the applicant was again asked to justify this recommendation and since 
no data is available, to base the recommendation on the current scientific knowledge. The applicant did 
not provide any further scientific rationale behind the recommendation and the recommendation is 
based on precautionary measures only. This could however be considered acceptable due to the potent 
developmental toxicity effect of ripretinib. The exposure margin based on AUC at NOAEL in the pivotal 
embryo-foetal development study in rat vs clinical exposure in humans was 0.02.  
Regarding impurities, rat and dog toxicity studies were used to calculate exposure margins. According 
to the analytical certificates for the 4 weeks studies in rat and dog the batch of the test item was 
BREC-0809-082 not BREC-0809-092 as stated in Module 3.2.S.3.2 and 3.2.P.5.5. Furthermore, the 
retention times and area % are slightly different. The different impurities are not identified. In the 13-
weeks studies in rat and dog, the presented data in the study reports corresponds to the data 
presented in Quality Modules. During the first round of the procedure, the applicant has clarified the 
confusion regarding the information of the batches of the used test items. The specified drug 
substance impurities can be considered adequately qualified at the proposed specification limits.  
The applicant refers to an in silico assessment of the genotoxic potential of four impurities.  No 
mutagenic risks were observed. The reports from this analysis could not be found in the dossier. The 
applicant claims that the reports have been submitted but the reports could not be located. The study 
report has been submitted upon request.  
The severe dermal effects observed in animals needs also to be taken into consideration in the 
assessment of the phototoxic potential. It could be questioned if an in vivo study could significantly 
add to the safety evaluation of ripretinib. Nevertheless, the applicant was in the first round of the 
procedure requested to justify the absence of a follow-up assessment regarding phototoxicity 
according to the ICH S10 and the CHMP SA provided in the issue. Any data indicative of phototoxicity 
from the clinical studies should also be presented. The applicant has tried to justify the absence of a 
follow up on the positive result in the 3T3 NRU assay. The justification is basically that there is no need 
for a follow up. This statement is in contrast to the ICH S10 Guidance on photosafety evaluation of 
pharmaceuticals as well as the advice given by CHMP. The applicant concludes that the evidence and 
clinical experience are inconclusive and that it seems difficult to speculate to any phototoxicity risk in 
patients treated with ripretinib. However, it is considered unlikely that the currently proposed 
precautionary measures would be removed as a consequence of a negative in vivo phototoxicity study 
since photosensitivity reactions have been observed in 2 patients. Furthermore, similar restrictions are 
included for substances in the same class.

The proposed text in the SmPC section 4.4 and the inclusion of phototoxicity as an important potential 
risk in the RMP is thus acceptable and no in vivo phototoxicity study is requested. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for ripretinib indicates no major issues for concern.   The 
CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non clinical issues: A request to 
submit an experimentally determined LogKow which the applicant has stated to be submitted post 
approval in March 2022.

There are 3 additional studies of ripretinib currently ongoing:  
- DCC-2618-03-002 (INTRIGUE), a Phase 3 open-label randomised, multi-centre study of ripretinib 
(150 mg QD) versus sunitinib in patients with advanced GIST after treatment with imatinib (2nd line 
GIST). This study is ongoing (n=453). 
- DCC-2618-01-004, a Phase 1 study of the PK, safety, and tolerability of ripretinib (50 mg) in subjects 
with hepatic impairment compared to healthy controls. This study is ongoing. 
- DCC-2618-01-007, a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the effects of ripretinib (150 mg QD) on 
the PK of repaglinide (0.5mg, a CYP2C8 probe substrate) in patients with advanced GIST. This study is 
ongoing. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Ripretinib (also known as DCC-2618) is a new chemical entity and the pharmacokinetic studies should 
thus aim at describing the disposition and also to identify subgroups where an increased or decreased 
exposure can be expected based on the pharmacokinetic properties. Potential interactions based on 
the pharmacokinetic properties should also be evaluated.  
Ripretinib is a lipophilic, weak base compound, in a highly crystalline form that is practically insoluble 
in aqueous media. Ripretinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine-protein kinase (KIT) and of platelet-derived 
growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) kinase. The sought indication is for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who have received prior treatment with   kinase 
inhibitor therapies. The recommended dosage of ripretinib is 150 mg (three 50 mg tablets) taken orally 
once daily at the same time each day with or without food. The recommended dose reduction for 
adverse reactions is 100 mg orally, once daily. 
PK data for ripretinib and DP-5439 is currently available from 4 clinical studies and numerous in vitro 
studies. All PK studies were conducted according to GCP. 
The major metabolic pathway of ripretinib is N-demethylation to form an active metabolite known as 
DP-5439. DP-5439 has a similar pharmacologic activity to ripretinib on both KIT and PDGFRA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 40/134 
 
 
 
 
The active moiety (based on ripretinib and DP-5439) is used for correlations to efficacy, while for 
safety both ripretinib and DP-5439 each and combined as the active moiety are considered. The 
therapeutic window is currently not clearly defined, but dose adjustments are foreseen in case of 
adverse events.   
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
Ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439 were quantified by LC-MS using validated methods in 
human K2EDTA plasma, urine and faeces. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
A non-compartmental analysis and a population PK analysis were used.  
The population PK analysis and PK/PD modelling was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling 
with the NONMEM software. The first-order conditional estimation method of NONMEM with interaction 
(FOCE INTER) method was used for model development. R version 3.4.4 was used for simulations. 
The population PK model was developed PK from 350 patients pooled from Studies DCC-2618-01-001 
and DCC 2618-03-001 (Invictus)with a total of 5587 PK observations of each ripretinib and DP-5439. 
There were 303 (5.4%) BLQ ripretinib concentrations, 423 (7.6%) BLQ DP-5349 observations, and 4 
(0.1%) DP-5439 concentrations above the assay limit of quantification (ALQ). The BLQ and ALQ 
concentrations were treated as missing. 
A covariate analysis was conducted to assess the sources of variability in ripretinib PK using a full 
model approach with backward elimination. Candidate covariate-parameter selections were chosen 
based on evaluation of random effect vs. covariate plots and on clinical relevance. The candidate 
covariate-parameter relationships were added simultaneously to the base model, resulting in the full 
model. Model covariate relationships dropped from the full model using a backward elimination method 
based on a statistical significance level of p < 0.005. Highly correlated covariates (e.g., absolute value 
of correlation coefficient > 0.3) were not be included together on the same parameter.  
Ripretinib final model 
Ripretinib oral PK was described by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination (Population 
Pharmacokinetic Modeling Report). The absorption phase was described as zero-order drug release 
followed by first-order absorption with a modest, linear dose-dependent decrease in relative 
bioavailability (Frel). Food delayed absorption without affecting rate of absorption and increased Frel 
by increasing dose levels. A high-fat meal also increased Frel, with greater effects on Frel at higher 
doses and a 36% increase in Frel at 150 mg. 
The only covariate effects retained were 29% lower CL/F in females compared to males and 23% 
higher Ka in patients with prior gastrectomy. However, both were not deemed to be clinically 
meaningful based on the safety and efficacy E-R analyses.

DP-5439 final model 
Ripretinib concentrations derived from the post hoc (i.e., model-predicted patient-level) ripretinib PK 
parameter estimates from the final ripretinib model were used as input for the development of the 
model for the metabolite DP-5439. 
The PK of the active metabolite of ripretinib, DP-5439, was described as a 1-compartment model with 
linear elimination, with its formation generated from the central compartment of ripretinib (Table 10). 
No covariate analysis was performed for DP-5439.

Simulations 
The reference patient was defined as a male patient without prior gastrectomy taking the clinical dose 
of 150 mg QD ripretinib in the fast ed state. AUC values for the different scenarios displayed were 
derived from 1500 simulated replicates that incorporated BSV. The median simulated ripretinib AUC,ss 
for the reference patient was 11.6 μg*h/mL and 19.9 μg*h/mL for DP-5439.

Ripretinib AUCSS following 150 mg QD was predicted to be 40% higher in females compared to males, 
but a negligible effect of sex on DP-5439 exposure was predicted. The effect of prior gastrectomy on 
ripretinib and DP-5439 exposures was predicted to be minor (no effect on AUC and a 9% increase in 
ripretinib maximum concentration). Relative to 150 mg QD administered in the fasted state, 150 mg 
QD administered with a high-fat meal was predicted to result in a 36% increase in AUC. Based on the 
exposure-response analyses, the effects of sex and ripretinib administration with a high-fat meal are 
not expected to be clinically meaningful. 
No clinically meaningful differences in the PK of ripretinib were observed based on age (19 to 87 
years), sex, race (White, Black, and Asian), body weight (39 to 138 kg), tumour type (GIST or other 
solid tumour), prior gastrectomy, mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 90 mL/min), and 
mild hepatic impairment (NCI hepatic impairment categories B1 and B2). 
There were insufficient data for an assessment of the effect of severe renal impairment and 
moderate/severe hepatic impairment with only 2 (0.571%) patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment, no patients with severe hepatic impairment, and only 4 (1.14%) patients with severe 
renal impairment. 
Absorption 
Ripretinib is a substrate of PgP, and data are inconclusive for BCRP. DP-5439 is a substrate of both PgP 
and BCRP.  
Ripretinib has low solubility and is thus a BCS class II or IV compound. An absolute bioavailability 
study has not been performed.  
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the clinical process formulation and the commercial 
formulation using the 50 mg dose. Ratios (test: reference) of least squares means (LSMs) for AUC0-t, 
AUC0-∞, and Cmax were 107.20%, 106.71%, and 105.78%, respectively, with each 90% confidence 
interval (CI) falling within 80% to 125%. Data for 150 mg from study DCC-2618-01-002 is presented 
in Table 11, as it is included in the SmPC. The dataset is however not powered for conclusions on 
bioequivalence.

Phase 1 study DCC-2618-01-001 data is included in the pop PK analysis, therefore only selected PK 
parameters are detailed here, as relevant in the applicants claims, ie 100 mg for dose reductions, 150 
mg QD as standard dose and 150 mg BID as used in case of disease progression in the Invictus study.  
The key PK findings of the escalation phase are summarised here, in Table 12 and Table 13 for the 100 
and 150 mg doses. Following single doses under fasted conditions on Cycle 1 Day 1, ripretinib PK 
parameters were highly variable between patients, with CV% for Cmax and AUC0-24 ranging from 
approximately 46% to 60% and 62% to 93% for the corresponding parameters for DP-5439 at 
ripretinib doses with PK data for at least 10 patients. The median tmax of ripretinib ranged from 
approximately 2 to 10 hours and 6-24h for DP-5439. After single dose of ripretinib, DP-5439 to 
ripretinib (metabolite to parent) ratios ranged from approximately 22%-to 92% based on AUC0-t 
across the studied dose range, with a M:P ratio for AUC0-t at the 150 mg dose of ripretinib of 66%.

The administration of the intended dose of 150 mg ripretinib with a high-fat meal increased the 
exposures (AUC0-24) to ripretinib and the metabolite DP-5439 by approximately 30% and 47%, 
respectively, compared to the fasted condition in study DCC-2618-01-001. Following this, ripretinib 
was administered regardless of meals in the rest of study DCC-2618-01-001 and in the phase 3 study 
INVICTUS.  
Ratios of ripretinib AUC0-24 fed vs fasted were 82%, 81%, 69%, 95% and 154% for 20mg, 30 mg, 50 
mg, 100 mg and 200mg respectively, for 3-4 subjects per dose group, with the exception of the 100 
mg group with n=14. At 100 mg ripretinib, the ratio of Cmax fed/fasted was 103%.

Distribution 
Protein binding of ripretinib was 99.93% in pooled human plasma. Ripretinib was bound to 99.8% to 
HSA (at both 1 and 10 µM) and to 99.4% and 98.6% for α1-AGP solutions, respectively. For DP-5439, 
protein binding was 99.7% and 99.6% in HSA and >99.8% and 98.7% in α1-AGP solutions, 
respectively for 1 and 10 µM. Both parent and metabolite extensively bound to the human plasma 
proteins, with no concentration dependency in binding to HAS. However, there was a modest 
concentration dependency in binding to α1-AGP. 
Ripretinib primarily partitions to plasma. with mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratios (Cb/Cp) 
ranging from 0.843 to 0.879 (human 1), 0.736 to 0.867 (human 2), and 0.748 to 0.813 (human 3). 
In study DCC-2618-01-002 in healthy subjects, 150 mg ripretinib given as the commercial formulation 
had a mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of 302 (35%) L for ripretinib and 491 
(38%) L for DP-5439. The apparent volume of distribution associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) 
was 278 (41%) L for ripretinib and 404 (49%) L for DP-5439 in healthy subjects receiving a single 150 
mg dose of ripretinib. 
Elimination 
In study DCC-2618-01-002 in healthy subjects, 150 mg ripretinib given as the commercial formulation 
had a mean (CV%) apparent clearance of 15.2 (39%) L/h and 17.9 (56%) L/h for ripretinib and DP-
5439, respectively. Mean (CV%) half-life (t½) were 12.6 (17%) and 15.6 (23%) hours for ripretinib 
and DP-5439, respectively. 
Excretion 
A mass balance study was not performed as no suitable formulation was deemed suitable. The 
formulation challenges are 1) the poor solubility of the crystalline form of 14C-labeled ripretinib free 
base and 2) the infeasibility of spray-drying the radiolabelled crystalline material into amorphous form 
on hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) due to its radioactivity. These 
formulations are not clinically viable due to the decreased exposure observed with both the crystalline 
free-base form of ripretinib and non-spray-dried dispersion on HPMCAS formulations. In addition, in 
preclinical species, administration of 14C-labeled ripretinib free base in Labrasol resulted in poor 
tolerability in rat single dose PK and mass balance studies. 
In study DCC-2618-01-003 cohort 2, a single oral dose of 50 mg unlabelled ripretinib was given to 
healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Human plasma, urine and faecal samples were collected 
from 10 healthy subjects through 1 week (168 hours). Cumulative recovery of ripretinib and its active 
metabolite DP-5439 in both urine and faeces appeared to plateau during the 1-week collection period. 
Excretion of metabolites other than DP-5439 in faeces were not evaluated. Through 1 week (168 
hours) after a single oral administration of 50 mg ripretinib (given alone), 0.0216% of the ripretinib 
dose was excreted unchanged in urine and 34.21% of the ripretinib dose was excreted unchanged in 
faeces, while 0.1044% of the ripretinib dose was excreted as metabolite DP 5439 in urine and 5.910% 
in faeces. For combined ripretinib and DP-5439, 0.126% of the ripretinib dose was excreted in urine 
and 40.12% in faeces. 
The mean apparent renal clearance (CLr/F) for ripretinib (3.06 mL/h) was lower compared to the mean 
plasma clearance (13.55 L/h). The mean CLr/F for DP-5439 (18.0 mL/h) was also lower compared to 
the mean apparent systemic clearance (CL/F, 18.54 L/h). This suggested that the systemic elimination 
of ripretinib and DP-5439 was not primarily attributed to the kidney. 
The clinical results are consistent with pre-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) studies with [14C]-ripretinib where > 88% of the radiolabelled oral dose to rats and

intravenous (IV) dose in dogs were recovered in the faeces, while less than 1% of the administered IV 
dose to dogs was recovered in the urine (Studies DCC-2618-03-0037 and DCC-2618-03-0038). 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of ripretinib was investigated in several in vitro studies and an in vivo study with 
unlabelled ripretinib. The main elimination pathway for ripretinib is via N-demethylation to DP-5439, 
which possesses similar pharmacological activity. In vitro metabolic identification suggested that 
ripretinib was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 but also to a minor extent by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. 
CYP3A4 was the major pathway in the metabolism of DP-5439. In addition, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 each may also play a role in the metabolism of DP-5439. 
Genotyping for CYP2D6 in a subset (n=46) of patients in the PK population of study DCC-2618-01-001 
did not reveal any trend in AUC0-24 or Cmax of ripretinib and DP-5439. 
Aside DP-5439, five further metabolites were observed in vitro. DP-5439 and six further metabolites 
were observed in plasma and urine and each of the six remaining metabolites was excreted as <1% of 
the (unlabelled) dose. Apart from DP-5439, only M1 and M3 were detected both in vitro and in vivo, 
and only M1 and DP-5439 were found both in plasma and urine.  
The systemic exposure of the main plasma metabolite DP-5439 was in the same range as ripretinib 
and was studied in all clinical studies. 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality was assessed with data from study DCC-2618-01-001, with ripretinib doses of 20 
mg BID to 200 mg BID, and 100 mg to 250 mg QD at C1D1 and C1D15. Data included in the analysis 
was in fasted state. Across the dose range of 20-250 mg, ripretinib and DP-5439 PK appeared to be 
less than dose proportional, especially at ripretinib doses higher than 150 mg. 
Time dependency 
Time dependency was evaluated at C1D15 using Cmax and AUC0-12 in study DCC-2618-01-001. At 
Cycle 1 Day 15, for ripretinib, the accumulation ratios for AUC0-12 and Cmax were 1.66 and 1.61, 
respectively, when compared to the Cycle 1 Day 1 for ripretinib 150 mg QD. For DP-5439, a 5.29-fold 
accumulation for AUC0-12 and a 4.57-fold accumulation for Cmax were observed when compared to 
the Cycle 1 Day 1 for ripretinib 150 mg QD, with a geometric mean M:P ratio of 1.29 based on AUC0-t. 
For the 150 mg QD regimen in the Expansion Cohort (n=130) in study DCC-2618-01-001, 
accumulation estimates ranged from approximately 1.4 to 1.9 calculated with AUC0-6. There was no 
evidence of time dependency in trough concentrations. Steady-state conditions appears to be achieved 
within 14 days. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the pop PK analysis, interindividual variability was 54% on CL/F, 58% on Vc/F, 1465% on Vp/F, 
43% on Ka and 71% on the duration of the zero order release for ripretinib. Intra individual variability 
for ripretinib was 41%. Similarly high variability was observed in NCA data from study DCC-2618-01-
001. 
For DP-5439, interindividual variability was 85% on CLM/F and 73%% on VcM/F. Intra individual 
variability for DP-5439 was 41%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
All studies were performed in patients, except for study DCC 2618 01-002 (bioequivalence) and study 
DCC 2618 01-003 (DDI) in healthy subjects. An informal cross-study comparison indicates that 
Assessment report

ripretinib and DP-5439 Cmax and AUC following single doses of ripretinib are generally similar between 
GIST patients in Study DCC 2618-01-001 compared to the healthy subjects in Study DCC 2618 01-
002. 
Data from the phase 3 study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) is included in the pop PK analysis and 
consists primarily of trough concentrations of ripretinib and DP-5439.  
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The renal recovery from Study DCC-2618-01-003 suggested that renal elimination does not play an 
important role in the excretion of ripretinib. Based on the population PK analysis, ripretinib and DP-
5439 PK exposure in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (baseline creatinine clearance 
[CrCL] 30 to < 90 mL/min) is similar with that in patients with normal renal function for ripretinib 
150 mg QD.  
Data in patients with severe renal impairment is scarce, thus a new cohort in patients with CrCL 
between 20 and 50 mL/min will study exposure levels, tolerability and patient safety in the ongoing 
study DCC-2618-01-001.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Ripretinib and DP-5439 are metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, hence hepatic impairment may 
impact ripretinib PK. Based on the population PK analysis, ripretinib and DP-5439 PK exposure in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment (National Cancer Institute [NCI] hepatic impairment category B) 
is similar with that in patients with normal hepatic function for ripretinib 150 mg QD. The impact of 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment on the PK of ripretinib is unknown and will be studied in the 
ongoing dedicated hepatic impairment study DCC-2618-01-004.  
Gender & Weight 
Ripretinib AUCSS following 150 mg QD was predicted to be 40% higher in females compared to males, 
but a negligible effect of gender on DP-5439 exposure was predicted. Body weight (39 to 138 kg) was 
not a significant covariate in the population PK analysis. 
Race & Age 
Race and age (18 to 87 years) were not significant covariates in the population PK analysis (White, 
78%; Black, 7.7%; Asian, 5.7%; American Indian or Alaskan native, 0.86%; other, 4.3%; and 
missing, 3.4%). Ripretinib is not intended for children and has a PIP waiver for studies in paediatric 
patients.

Effect of other medicines on ripretinib 
Ripretinib and DP-5439 are substrates of CYP3A4/5. CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 also play a role in the 
metabolism of ripretinib. In addition, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 each 
may also play a role in the metabolism of DP-5439. 
Ripretinib and DP-5439 are substrates of PgP and BCRP. Data for ripretinib and BCRP are currently 
inconclusive though. Ripretinib and DP-5439 were not substrates of OATP1B1, 1B3, OAT1 (DP-5439), 
OAT3, OCT1 (ripretinib), OCT2, BSEP (DP-5439), MATE1 or MATE2-K (parentheses indicate that data 
was available only for one of ripretinib or DP-5439).   
The effects of concomitant administration with the PgP and CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole were studied 
in vivo. Ratios of geometric LS means for plasma ripretinib AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax were 
198.36%, 198.74%, and 135.71%, respectively, for ripretinib with itraconazole relative to ripretinib 
alone. For DP-5439 AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax ratios were 194%, 199%, and 106%, respectively, 
for ripretinib with itraconazole relative to ripretinib alone. For the active moiety AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and 
Cmax ratios were 198.50%, 202%, and 127%, respectively, for ripretinib with itraconazole relative to 
ripretinib alone. 
Concomitant administration of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin 600mg QD decreased the mean AUCs of 
both ripretinib and DP-5439 or the combined ripretinib+DP-5439 by approximately 60%, compared 
with administration of ripretinib alone. The effects of rifampicin on Cmax were smaller in magnitude 
and divergent for ripretinib (decreased by 18%) versus DP-5439 (increased by 37%), but the Cmax for 
ripretinib combined with DP-5439 was similar with and without rifampicin.     
The effects of concomitant administration of PPI were studied in vivo with pantoprazole. Ratios of 
geometric LS means for plasma ripretinib AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax were 109.01%, 109.32%, and 
103.23%, respectively, for ripretinib with pantoprazole relative to ripretinib alone. For DP-5439 AUC0-
t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax, these were 130.96%, 130.13%, and 112.28%, respectively, for ripretinib with 
pantoprazole relative to ripretinib alone. For combined ripretinib and DP-5439 AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and 
Cmax, these were 116.33%, 116.58%, and 103.76%, respectively, for ripretinib with pantoprazole 
relative to ripretinib alone.

Assuming Ki = IC50/2 * lowest of 2 independent experiments 
No time-dependant inhibition was observed, except for CYP3A4. KI of CYP3A4 inhibition by ripretinib 
(using midazolam as the substrate) was determined as 2.5 ± 0.9 µM, with kinact 0.0034 ± 0.0005 
min-1 and kinact/KI 1.4 min-1 mM-1. 
The mechanistic static model was used to assess the inhibition of CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 by 
ripretinib, using Ki listed in the table above. AUCR were 1.31, 1.08, 1.06 and 1.02, respectively.   
An in vivo study with repaglinide, as a sensitive substrate of CYP2C8, is ongoing. No other studies are 
planned.  
CYP3A4 and 2B6 induction by ripretinib and DP-5439were observed. A ripretinib and DP-5439 
concentration-dependent decrease of CYP1A2 mRNA was observed.   
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Ripretinib 
The ripretinib Cmax,ss relevant for safety is taken from study DCC-2618-01-001 at C1D15 150 mg 
ripretinib given under fasting conditions and is 761 ng/mL. Only AUC0-12 is reported in that study.  
In study DCC-2618-01-002, where a single dose of 150 mg ripretinib as commercial formulation was 
given in fasted state, AUCinf was 9855.8 ng*h/mL. In the pop PK analysis, the median simulated 
ripretinib AUC,ss for the reference patient was 11600 ng*h/mL.

DP-5439 
The DP-5439 Cmax,ss relevant for safety is taken from study DCC-2618-01-001 at C1D15 150 mg 
ripretinib given under fasting conditions and is 804 ng/mL. Only AUC0-12 is reported in that study. 
In study DCC-2618-01-002, where a single dose of 150 mg ripretinib as commercial formulation was 
given in fasted state, AUCinf was 8146.2 ng*h/mL. In the pop PK analysis, the median simulated DP-
5439 AUC,ss for the reference patient was 19900 ng*h/mL. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Exposure/response 
QT 
An evaluation of the concentration-QTc relationship for ripretinib was conducted based on time 
matched ECG-concentration measurements in the escalation cohort of Study DCC 2618 01-001. 
Ripretinib doses ranged from 20 to 200 mg BID and 100 to 250 mg QD, including clinical dose of 150 
mg QD for 18 patients and above-the-daily clinical doses for 23 patients. Both the by-timepoint and 
the concentration-QTc analysis demonstrated that ripretinib at the studied doses did not cause 
clinically relevant QT prolongation. The relationship between the ΔQTcF and concentrations of ripretinib 
were investigated by linear mixed effects modelling.  
The estimated population slope of the ripretinib concentration-QTc relationship was shallow and slightly 
negative. The predicted ΔQTcF at ripretinib Cmax at 150 mg QD is -8.97 ms (90%CI -10.43; -3.41) for 
a Cmax of 840.8 ng/mL (90% CI 706.04 -1001.35).  
The estimated population slope of the DP-5439 concentration-QTc relationship was negative and 
statistically significant. The predicted ΔQTcF at DP-5439 Cmax when given 150 mg ripretinib QD is -
7.28 ms (90%CI -10.37; -4.18) for a Cmax of 717.7 ng/mL (90% CI 538.18 -957.14). 
Exposure response modelling 
Observed average trough concentrations (Cmin) of ripretinib, DP-5439, and combined ripretinib + DP-
5439 up to the time of the adverse event (AE; for safety endpoints) or up to the time of disease 
progression/death or censoring (for PFS) were calculated using observed trough concentrations. Cmin 
was used to perform exposure-response analyses for safety for patients in Study DCC-2618-01-001 
and the invictus trial and for efficacy (i.e., PFS) for patients in the invictus trial. Combined ripretinib 
and DP-5439 exposure was the sum of ripretinib and DP-5439 exposure with a molecular weight 
correction.  
Safety 
Univariate logistic regression was used to investigate the probability of experiencing any grade or 
Grade 3 or higher (Gr3+) AEs for the following safety endpoints: palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (PPES), hypertension, myalgia, diarrhoea, and hyperbilirubinemia or increased blood 
bilirubin. With the exception of Gr3+ hypertension, there very few occurrences of Gr3+ AEs (rates ≤
2.2%).  
The only slopes with p-values <0.05 were those for any grade myalgia and any grade PPES versus 
ripretinib exposure (p = 0.0057 and 0.0023, respectively). The slopes for these 2 endpoints were 
relatively shallow. The probability of AE occurrence increased only from 27.5% to 64.1% for any grade 
myalgia and from 20.1% to 60.9% for any grade PPES over the large range of average ripretinib Cmin 
up to time of event/end of treatment for both safety endpoints. Exposures ranged from ripretinib Cmin 
of 31.2 ng/mL to the 46-fold higher ripretinib Cmin of 1450 ng/mL.

Efficacy 
Observed combined molecular weight-adjusted ripretinib + DP-5439 Cmin up to the time of disease 
progression/death or up to the time of censoring was used as the exposure measure for the analysis 
and was divided into 4 equally sized, rank-ordered, exposure groups [values ≤ first quartile (Q1) to 
values > third quartile (Q4)] for the exposure-PFS analysis, as seen in Figure 5.  
Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier Plots for PFS by active moiety exposure group 
PFS was analysed as a time-to-event variable using the Cox proportional hazard model. The following 
baseline covariates were tested but found non-significant: age, race, body weight, ECOG performance 
status, number of prior anticancer treatments, mutation status (4 categories, namely, 1: KIT exon 9, 
2: KIT exon 11, 3: KIT/PDGFRα wild type, and 4: PDGFRα and KIT other exons). The appropriateness 
of the Cox proportional hazard models for PFS was primarily assessed through goodness-of-fit plots. 
Model diagnostics included plots of Schoenfeld residuals versus time. 
The HRs and 95% CIs for combined Cmin Q2 to Q4 relative to Q1 are depicted in Figure 6. All HRs for 
combined Cmin Q2 to Q4 were <1, indicating improved PFS compared to Q1. Only the HR for combined 
Cmin Q4 was statistically significant (95% confidence interval = 0.39 [0.17, 0.89]; p = 0.025).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
The bioanalytical methods were adequately validated. The lack of cross-validation was accepted since 
the Pop-PK analysis was based on the data supported by the same bioanalytical method.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The standard methodology of the pop PK analysis is accepted. Overall, VPCs and pcVPCs showed the 
model seemed to describe the data adequately. 
The structural population PK model incorporates a two-compartment model with a sequential zero- and 
first-order absorption process and linear elimination. A dose-dependent decrease in the relative 
bioavailability (Frel) with increasing dose, a dose-independent food effect on the duration of zero-order 
drug release, and a dose-dependent food effect on Frel were incorporated. The incorporation of dose 
and food effects on bioavailability is purely empirical. As it seems to be highly correlated, this increases 
the difficulty of the model interpretation. A reduced bioavailability as dose increases could be explained 
by the reduced solubility of ripretinib within the gastrointestinal tract. The increase in the relative 
bioavailability as dose increases in the presence of high fat meal conditions might reinforce the 
justification of higher solubility in the presence of surfactants. Overall, the proposed model properly 
characterizes the observations, although it lacks to mechanistically explain the absorption process.  
A significant model misspecification based on the GOF was observed at higher concentration values, 
indicating a likely bias in the Cmax characterization. It is agreed that the model misspecification is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 55/134 
 
 
 
 
 
partially unclear since pc-VPC does not show any significant bias around Cmax and the additional 
difficulty to experimentally capture the Cmax. Since no experimental predicted concentrations were 
considered for the exposure-response analysis, such difference in the GOF plots should be considered 
of minimum relevance.   
Variability on Vp/F is very high (1465%) and it cannot be attributed to particular covariates and 
denotes instability in the model. The condition number is high, indicating that the model is over 
parametrised. The VPCs and further diagnostic plots show however that the model is nevertheless able 
to describe the data. The role of this model in this application is primarily the description of the data, 
and support of dosing recommendations in special populations. Overall, the model is not considered 
pivotal for the application, and an update was not be requested. The significance of the covariates 
retained in the model should however be interpreted with caution, due to the issues cited above.  
Replacing the covariate sex by body weight on CL/F lead to a statistically inferior model, which is 
agreed. 
The management of metabolite concentrations in the model is adequate. VPCs indicate that the 
metabolite model is able to describe DP-5439 data. No covariate analysis was performed for the DP-
5439 model. Since the PK of DP-5439 is relatively similar to ripretinib (ie similar elimination and 
excretions pathways, similar half-life), the DP-5439 is directly impacted by the covariates from the 
ripretinib model, and this may be sufficient.  
Overall, variability in all parameters is high, and the confidence intervals are overlapping with the 
reference patient (male, fasted, without gastrectomy), indicating the covariates likely do not have a 
clinically relevant impact. 
Absorption 
Study DCC-2618-01-001 
The metabolite to parent ratio increased from single dose to steady state, with AUC0-t ratios of 0.49 at 
single dose and 1.29 at C1D15 of 150 mg QD administration. This is in line with the slightly longer t1/2 
of DP-5439. 
For the selection of the dose for the phase 2 part of study DCC-2618-01-001, a threshold in active 
moiety AUC0-24 was selected based on preclinical studies. The applicant claims that >90% of the 
patients would have an exposure above this threshold when administered 150 mg ripretinib QD. While 
no analysis has been provided to support this claim, single dose data indicates that mean AUC0-24 is 
higher than 10000 when considering both ripretinib and DP-5439, this issue will thus not be pursued. 
The administration of 150 mg ripretinib with a high-fat meal increased the exposures (AUC0-24) to 
ripretinib and the metabolite DP-5439 by approximately 30% and 47%, respectively, compared to the 
fasted condition. The fasted condition corresponded to a short fast, and not an overnight fast as in 
some of the other studies. The effect may thus be slightly underestimated. Since ripretinib was then 
administered regardless of food intake, including in the phase 3 study, this recommendation is agreed. 
Of note, the magnitude of the effect is smaller than upon co-administration with itraconazole.  
The food effect differed depending on the administered dose. It was negligible for 100 mg ripretinib, 
which will be used in case of dose reduction due to adverse events.  
While the food effect may not be clinically relevant, its effect on PK is nonetheless significant, thus 
dose proportionality analyses were stratified by feeding status.   
Study DCC-2618-01-002 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 56/134 
 
 
 
The design of the bioequivalence study DCC-2618-01-002 was adequate, including the wash-out time 
of at least 7 days and the fasted state. Since only one strength (50 mg) is available and given the 
adverse events observed in healthy subjects, it is acceptable to study 50 mg.  
Some batches of drug substance were milled, while others were not in the clinical process batches. 
Since the batch selected as reference contained unmilled substance, this is considered to constitute an 
extreme which is compared to the test formulation containing milled substance. Since these two 
formulations were demonstrated bioequivalent, the bioequivalence is acceptable for the whole range of 
clinical process batches.  
The intended commercial formulation (test formulation) and the formulation used during clinical 
development in Phase 1 Study DCC-2618-01-001 and Phase 3 Study DCC-2618-03-001, were 
demonstrated to be bioequivalent for ripretinib. There is no requirement of equivalence on DP-5439. 
Its concentration was however similar between the reference and test formulation. 
PK parameters from this study are used in the SmPC and for safety calculations.  
Distribution 
The in vitro protein binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and α-1 acid glycoprotein (α-1-AGP) and 
blood distribution studies with 14C-ripretinib were conducted in adequate conditions. The studied 
concentration range covered the expected physiological concentrations upon 150 mg QD dosing of 
ripretinib.  
Both ripretinib and its active metabolite DP-5439 bind to plasma proteins at > 99% and ripretinib 
primarily partitions to plasma. There was no concentration dependency for binding of ripretinib or DP-
5439 to HSA. A slight concentration dependency in the binding to α1-AGP is noted for both ripretinib 
and DP-5439. Even though the absolute difference appears small, this may represent a ca 4-fold 
increase in free active moiety. The applicant committed to measuring free concentration in the planned 
hepatic impairment study. (See post authorisation measures section). 
The blood distribution of DP-5439 was not investigated and its protein binding was not determined in 
human plasma, but only in solutions of HAS or α-1-AGP. A cellular distribution similar to ripretinib is 
assumed and therefore the lack of blood distribution data for DP-5439 is acceptable. Regarding protein 
binding, the data with human serum protein is in the same range as ripretinib, therefore similar overall 
protein binding in human plasma is expected. The SmPC claim “Both ripretinib and its active 
metabolite DP-5439 bind to plasma proteins at ≥ 99%.” is considered acceptable.  
Elimination 
The applicant presented a detailed discussion of the formulation challenges that prevented the 
execution of a mass balance study in human. It is agreed that such a study is not feasible at the 
moment. In Q4 of the central advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/132691/2020, a thorough justification was 
demanded regarding the formulation challenges, and the applicant complied with this request. The 
advice further asked the applicant to consider an iv microdosing study to obtain information about the 
volume of distribution and clearance. This information is however not considered essential for this MAA 
and a microdosing study is therefore not requested.  
In question 4b, the applicant also inquired about the extent of characterisation of ripretinib metabolism 
and excretion, which was considered sufficient with comments on the stability of glucuronides in 
samples, severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment studies and potential interactions in the advice. 
Both issues were adequately addressed by the applicant in the MAA, with planned studies where data 
is not currently available.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021

In the absence of mass balance study, the applicant collected data from non-labelled ripretinib. The 
overall recovery of ripretinib and DP-5439 at 168h is 40.3%. Considering the t1/2 of both ripretinib 
and DP-5439 in plasma, both should be fully eliminated within 168h, which is also suggested by the 
plateau in recovery. A longer study would thus not necessarily provide more information. It is known 
that quantitative extraction of unlabelled compound from faeces is challenging and may contribute to 
the low recovery. 
Urine and plasma samples were also analysed to detect further metabolites (see section below). 3 
metabolites were identified in plasma, which contributed each to less than 1% of the total peak area.  
In urine, four additional metabolites were identified. Considering the total peak area through 168 hours 
postdose, ripretinib accounted for 15 to 100%, DP-5439, hydroxy-DP-5439-1 (M1), DP-5439-
glucuronide (M24), DCC-2618-glucuronide (M27) and Oxy-DP-5439-2 (M23) ranged from 19 to 30%, 6 
to 23%, 4 to 29%, 9 to 35%, and 2 to 6% (in 48h) of the total peak area, respectively. Even 
considering the lowest fractions of ripretinib and DP-5439, (15% and 19%), these semi-quantitative 
measures indicate that the remaining metabolites would presumably not significantly impact the 
overall recovery of ripretinib.  
Overall, the available data, both in vivo and in vitro indicates that the PK of ripretinib and its 
metabolites is similar in preclinical species and in human, suggesting that indeed, the low recovery is 
simply due to the sensitivity of methods when using unlabelled material, and that the risk of identifying 
additional major metabolites is low. It could however not be assured that all metabolites are detected 
and there is a risk that minor metabolites are missed since unlabelled material is used. This is 
considered acceptable, as ripretinib is intended for use in advanced malignancies, metabolite 
qualification is not a formal requirement (ICH S9 Q&A). Consequently, the excretion of ripretinib is 
considered adequately described. The applicant provided pre-clinical data suggesting no significant 
ripretinib accumulation in a particular tissue/organ and reviewed safety information of studies DCC-
2618-01-001 and DCC-2618-03-001 finding no particular safety concerns in melanin-containing 
tissues. As the recovery curve of non-labelled ripretinib and DP-5439 reached a plateau by 1-week of 
collections (168 h) and the elimination t1/2 of both moieties indicate that ripretinib and DP-5439 
should be fully eliminated by this time, it is consistent to state that accumulation of ripretinib in other 
tissues/organs is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
The reaction phenotyping indicated that CYP3A4/5 was the major pathway in the metabolism of 
ripretinib. In addition, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 also play a role in the metabolism of ripretinib. This is 
consistent with the SmPC claims.  
An in vivo interaction study with itraconazole and a study with rifampicin were conducted, see in the 
interaction section. The applicant compared the magnitude of effect of CYP3A4 inhibition or induction, 
where the co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitor itraconazole lead to AUC0-∞ 
increase by 99% for both ripretinib and DP-5439, without the need for a dose adjustment. 
Consequently, it is agreed that an interaction with CYP2C8 or CYP2D6 inhibitors is likely to be of lower 
magnitude. This is also supported by the data on CYP2D6 polymorphism.  
No clear trend was visible in AUC0-24 of Cmax of ripretinib and DP-5439 when stratified by CYP2D6 
phenotype. Any trend may be masked by the overall high variability in the PK of ripretinib, and that 
few patients were poor metabolisers. Nevertheless, the lack of trend supports that CYP2D6 has a minor 
role in the metabolism of ripretinib and that CYP2D6 polymorphism is expected to have a minor impact 
on the PK of ripretinib and DP-5439. 
The reaction phenotyping indicated that CYP3A4 was the major pathway in the metabolism of DP-
5439. In addition, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 each may also play a 
role in the metabolism of DP-5439.

DP-5439 is the only major metabolite currently identified in plasma. The other detected metabolites 
are minor metabolites and do not require qualification in preclinical species or in vitro DDI studies.  
The probability that major metabolites remain unidentified in urine and plasma is deemed low. There is 
a risk that minor metabolites are missed since unlabelled material was used in vivo.  
Dose proportionality 
Fasted state: Despite the substantial variability, the PK of both ripretinib and DP-5439 appears less 
than dose proportional across the dose range 20-250 mg, for Cmax, AUC0-24 (or AUC0-12) at C1D1. The 
difference appears less striking at C1D15, this may however be masked by using AUC0-12, as 24h is not 
available. As noted earlier, AUC0-12 is not considered appropriate for a substance with a half-life of 
12.6h and 15.6h for ripretinib and DP-5439, respectively.  
Time dependency 
The available data seem to indicate substantial accumulation, these are however misleading as they 
are based on AUC0-12, which is not adequate for ripretinib and DP-5439, which have longer t1/2 and 
tmax ranging from 2-24h for ripretinib and 4-25h for DP-5439. Trough concentrations and the pop PK 
analysis may provide a better base for conclusions on time-dependency in this case. The accumulation 
of ripretinib and DP-5439 in the expansion phase is nevertheless in the expected range for a compound 
with a half-life of 12.6h and 15.6h, respectively, indicating no evidence of time dependency.  
The applicant´s conclusion that there was no evidence in time dependency based on trough 
concentrations is agreed. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter- and intraindividual variability was high to very high on all parameters, despite the precision of 
their estimates. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
See pop PK analysis. 
The applicant discussed the therapeutic window for ripretinib, DP-5439 and the active moiety. A two 
fold exposure was reached in patients given 150 mg BID (upon disease progression). At this exposure, 
adverse events were increased. The upper limit of tolerated exposure of 2 fold exposure of both 
ripretinib and DP-5439 was not agreed and dose adjustments were requested. The applicant presented 
a new analysis of safety in these patients, and it is now agreed that doubled PK exposure resulting 
from dose escalation to ripretinib 150 mg BID was generally well tolerated. The largest difference was 
observed for abdominal pain and anaemia, and it is agreed that it is not possible to truly distinguish 
whether the difference is due to disease progression or is a true ADR.  
Warnings are in place for patients at risk of reaching a twofold exposure, namely patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment (close monitoring, SmPC section 4.2), patients receiving 
strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors (caution and monitoring, SmPC section 4.4 and 4.5), which is deemed 
adequate. A similar warning is also requested for patients who need co-administration with strong 
CYP3A4 inducers and thus require 150 mg ripretinib BID (see below). 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
It is agreed that no dose adjustment of ripretinib is necessary for subjects with mild or moderate renal 
impairment, and that no recommendation can be made for severe renal impairment. This is consistent 
with the SmPC claims. The data from the new cohort confirmed the conclusions from the pop PK.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 59/134 
 
 
 
Impaired hepatic function 
Since both ripretinib and DP-5439 are metabolised, and in the absence of mass balance study, a 
dedicated hepatic impairment study in patients with moderate to severe HI is warranted. The applicant 
committed to present the data of the ongoing study DCC-2618-01-004 and to include the unbound 
fraction in the investigations. The data is expected in Q1 2022. 
The design and dose of study DCC-2618-01-004 are considered adequate.  
Based on the pop PK data, it is agreed that no dose adjustment in mild hepatic impairment is required.  
Gender & Weight 
Gender is a significant covariate on CL/F in the pop PK model for ripretinib. The increased exposure in 
females is however not clinically relevant.  
Race & Age 
Age has been shown to have no effect on the PK of ripretinib and DP-5439.   
No clinically relevant changes in exposure were observed in patients according to their race status.

Victim interactions 
The in vivo inhibition of CYP3A4 and PgP by itraconazole results in a significant AUCR, though without 
alteration to the metabolite/parent ratio a both ripretinib and DP-5439 are CYP3A4 and PgP substrates. 
The applicant recommends caution and monitoring when co-administering strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 
similar warning for PgP has been included. Information that ripretinib and DP-5439 are PgP substrates 
has been included in the SmPC.

The applicant proposed a warning text for grapefruit juice, as part of aligning the PIL and the SmPC. 
The content of the warning is not agreed. Grapefruit is not a necessary part of a medical treatment and 
requiring monitoring along with grapefruit juice is an exaggerated measure and avoiding grapefruit 
juice is considered an easier measure to implement. Grapefruit may be mentioned after the other CYP 
inhibitors: ingestion of grapefruit juice is not recommended. The applicant accepted the proposed text. 
Co-administration with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (study DCC-2618-01-006) resulted in a 
40% AUCR, as compared to ripretinib given alone. A dose adjustment to 150 mg BID is proposed, if 
co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer is necessary. This is agreed for strong inducers, on the 
basis that 150mg ripretinib BID has been demonstrated to achieve approximately a two-fold exposure 
compared to 150mg ripretinib QD. The ripretinib dosing frequency is to be increased during the co-
administration period with the inducer.  
A similar dose adjustment is proposed for moderate CYP3A4 inducers and is based on PBPK modelling. 
The modelling for moderate inducers cannot be accepted, as doubts are raised on the predicted extent 
of induction with the CYP3A4 moderate inducer efavirenz, and the efavirenz compound file has 
numerous flaws. The simulated data should not be included in the SmPC. The applicant accepted to 
remove the PBPK data.  
The potential loss of efficacy in patients requiring co-administration with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer 
still needs to be addressed, and a dose adjustment may still be required but an exact recommendation 
cannot be made at this point. As a cautionary measure, close monitoring for both efficacy and safety 
should be considered if the dosing frequency was increased. The applicant accepted the proposed text. 
Dose adjustments are cross-referenced in section 4.2 and 4.4.  
Concomitant administration of pantoprazole 40 mg QD did not affect exposure to ripretinib. Ripretinib 
AUC0-t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax values met the bioequivalence criteria when co-administered with 
pantoprazole. The AUC of DP-5439 was slightly more elevated. Since the study may not be sufficiently 
powered for this endpoint, the issue is not pursued. It is agreed that the impact of co-administration of 
pantoprazole, and by extension other gastric acid modifying agents is not clinically relevant.  
The applicant concludes that ripretinib is a weak substrate of BCRP at 10 µM which is 
supraphysiological and where BCRP may be saturated. Since data is missing in the relevant 
physiological concentration range, a new in vitro experiment is required for BCRP, which follows the 
design outlined in appendix 3 of the DDI GL. The applicant committed to performing this study post 
marketing and included a warning in the SmPC (See post authorisation measures section-REC).

All mandatory CYPs and transporters were studied, including CYP3A4 with midazolam and testosterone, 
and time dependant inhibition for CYPs. Ki was not determined, but as experiments were performed at 
substrate concentrations at Km, it can be assumed that Ki = IC50/2. The design of in vitro assays was 
generally acceptable. 
A second set of Ki values for CYP2C19 and 2C19 inhibition by ripretinib and DP-5439 was provided, 
and mechanistic static modelling with the lowest value confirmed the lack of relevant interaction at 
physiological concentrations.  
For CYP2C8, the recommendation has been updated with more actionable measures and examples, 
until in vivo data become available. The applicant committed to reporting the results of DCC-2618-01-
007 (with repaglinide), and results are expected in March 2023. (See post authorisation measures 
section-REC)  
Studying in vitro inhibition of CYP3A4 by ripretinib up to 118 µM was not feasible due to the limited 
solubility of ripretinib. Inhibition in the intestine cannot be excluded and may result in a clinically 
relevant interaction with substrates of CYP3A4 that are mostly metabolised in the intestine. The 
applicant attempted modelling the interaction, which was not accepted. The applicant accepted the 
proposed SmPC text and in vivo study (see below, induction). 
Regarding the TDI of CYP3A4 by ripretinib, the applicant´s conclusion that it lacks clinical relevance is 
still not agreed. The applicant was invited to discuss the clinical relevance of this interaction in the 
intestine, particularly since the absorption of ripretinib is slow (tmax 4h). Since the interaction is 
complex (induction, metabolism-based inhibition in the intestine, partially irreversible, and potential 
direct inhibition in the intestine), PBPK modelling proposed by the applicant is not deemed appropriate 
to exclude to clinical relevance of this interaction. Therefore, a multiple dose in vivo study with 
midazolam is deemed necessary to exclude interactions in the intestine and systemically for the 
induction aspect. Until data is provided to exclude an interaction, a recommendation should be 
included in SmPC section 4.5. The applicant accepted the proposed SmPC text and committed to 
perform a multiple dose interaction study with midazolam. (post authorisation measures section-REC) 
A new CYP induction study was provided for ripretinib. The applicant´s conclusions that ripretinib and 
DP-5439 do not induce CYP 2B6 and 3A4 are not agreed, as signals were seen in the new study for 
ripretinib, confirming the earlier potential signals. 
A multiple dose in vivo CYP3A4 induction study with midazolam is thus warranted and should be 
submitted post authorisation. As DP-5439 is driving a part of the interaction, its PK characteristics 
should be taken into account in the design of the study. Furthermore, the study should include aspects 
of CYP3A4 inhibition in the intestine. Until the results become available, warnings for potential loss of 
efficacy of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates should be included in the SmPC, and a warning for potentially 
clinically relevant interaction with substrates of CYP3A4 that are mostly metabolised in the intestine. 
The applicant accepted the proposed SmPC text and committed to perform a multiple dose interaction 
study with midazolam. (post authorisation measures section-REC). 
As sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 are infrequently used, an SmPC warning for loss of efficacy of 
sensitive CYP2B6 substrates is considered a sufficient risk management measure and no in vivo study 
is requested. The applicant accepted the proposed text. 
In the CYP1A2 induction assays, concentration dependant down-regulation of CYP1A2 was apparent at 
non-cytotoxic concentration. As this effect is seen in the data of both ripretinib and DP-5439, this 
should be followed up in vivo. Considering that NTI CYP1A2 substrates are infrequently used, an SmPC 
warning is considered a sufficient risk management measure. The applicant accepted the proposed 
text.

Ripretinib is teratogen, and as such an in vivo study regarding its effects on contraceptive steroids 
should be performed regardless of the in vitro induction results if the drug is intended for use in fertile 
women, as is the case here. The applicant argued that the sought indication includes predominantly 
patients beyond the typical age of child-bearing potential. It is also agreed that a study in healthy 
subjects is not feasible, as steady-state concentrations would be required, which were not safe in 
healthy subjects. The suggested measure of including advice in SmPC section 4.4 (to add a barrier 
method if systemic contraceptive steroids are used) is adequate, with the addition of a similar warning 
in section 4.5.  
In the future, should ripretinib be used in other indications including women of childbearing potential, 
the feasibility of an interaction study in patients should be re-evaluated. 
Ripretinib is an inhibitor of BCRP at concentrations relevant in the gut and the liver. The applicant 
included actionable recommendations for co-administration with BCRP substrates and examples in the 
SmPC.  
An actionable recommendation was proposed for the inhibition of PgP by ripretinib and is agreed. 
In vivo inhibition of MATE-1 by DP-5439 cannot be excluded based on the in vitro data. The applicant 
included actionable recommendations for co-administration with BCRP substrates and examples in the 
SmPC.  
Ripretinib inhibited OATP1B3 with 40% at the highest concentration of 3 µM, which is below the inlet 
cutoff of 6.6 µM, calculated with ka 0.1 min-1. The applicant argued that a ka of 0.0015 min-1 (from the 
pop PK analysis) was more relevant than the worst case scenario. This is agreed. The inhibition of 
OATP1B3 can thus be excluded with the new cutoff of 1.56 µM.  
In the future, should a dose of 150 mg ripretinib bid be claimed in case of disease progression, then 
the following data would be used to determine the cutoffs: study DCC-2618-01-001 C1D15, ripretinib 
150 mg BID, ripretinib 1290 ng/mL, DP-5439 1800 ng/mL. This would correspond to a 50xCmax,u of 
1.26 µM for ripretinib and 1.81 µM for DP-5439. The inlet cutoff for ripretinib would then be 1.56 µM 
and the intestinal cutoff would remain unchanged. This entails that, in addition to known interaction 
that may increase in magnitude, perpetrator interactions on CYP2D6, 2C9 and 2C19 should be re-
assessed if 150 mg BID was to be given. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The applicant initially used AUC0-12 in their preclinical assessment, which was not agreed, particularly 
considering the t1/2 of both ripretinib and DP-5439. The use of data from AUC0-∞ values obtained 
from healthy participants in the DCC-2618-01-002 study who received single-doses of ripretinib 150 
mg. This is agreed as in the absence of time-dependency, AUCinf upon single dose should be 
representative for AUCtau at steady state. 
The choice of Cmax,ss used in the preclinical assessment is agreed. 
Exposure/response 
A supratherapeutic concentration range was included in the QTc study, which is adequate. It seems 
like a linear model cannot describe the exposure/QTc relationship, in particular for DP-5439. 
Nevertheless, both the raw data and the model do not indicate a prolonged QT interval. Both the 
ripretinib and DP-5439 QTc relationship indicated a shorter QTc. 
Observed average Cmin has been used in exposure response analyses instead Cmax, which is often 
relevant for safety. The sampling in the studies (mostly in the phase 3 study) is not sufficient to 
estimate Cmax. Pop PK predictions may have been used for the analysis instead. However, Cmin is 
expected to correlate with AUC and Cmax, and as such the analysis may be adequate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 64/134 
 
 
 
Ripretinib and DP-5439 are equipotent, therefore a correction for potency is not required in the 
combined exposure calculation. The difference in molecular weight between them is small, therefore it 
would have been acceptable not to correct for it. Overall, the calculation of the combined exposure is 
acceptable. 
The exposure/safety modelling approach is deemed adequate. The only identified correlations were 
between average ripretinib Cmin up to the time of the first AE occurrence or end of treatment and the 
AEs of any grade myalgia and any grade PPES. The range covering the majority of exposure at the 
proposed dosing regimen showed a probability of any grade Myalgia and any grade PPES from 33 to 
45% and 29 to 40%, indicating minimal impact in terms of safety due to ripretinib.  
The exposure/efficacy modelling approach was adequate. Since the modelling is based on patients that 
were all randomized to 150 mg one should interpret the E-R relationship with caution. It is difficult to 
discriminate between the effect of exposure and other reasons as only one dose was administered in 
the dataset. As such a confounded relationship cannot be excluded. 
A positive exposure-response relationship between active moiety Cmin up to the PFS was observed, 
with lower hazard ratio and improved PFS in exposure groups Q2 to Q4 relative to Q1. The lack of a 
clear and definitive exposure-efficacy relationship might be undermine by the large variability, but 
additional efforts should be performed in order to understand the exposure-efficacy relationship. In 
this sense, the applicant was encouraged to evaluate other exposure metrics (AUC or Cmax for the 
active moiety) related to PFS. The applicant justified the absence of evaluation of alternative PK 
metrics due to the higher eta-shrinkage, which may compromise the individual value predicted, which 
is accepted. The adequacy of Cmin to explain the exposure-response relationship is endorsed. The 
applicant clarified the lack of evaluation of unbound plasma concentrations in DCC-2618-03-001 study. 
Unbound ripretinib and DP-5439 observations will be collected in DCC-2618-01-004 study, which is 
endorsed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of ripretinib and its major active metabolite DP-5439 has been generally well-described. From a 
clinical pharmacology point of view, ripretinib is approvable, as the applicant has committed to the list 
of recommendations and accepted the suggested SmPC warnings.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Ripretinib was developed as a pan-KIT and PDGFRA inhibitor with the capacity to broadly inhibit KIT 
and PDGFRA kinase activity, including wild type as well as primary and secondary mutations.   
This application is based on two clinical studies, in support of ripretinib for the treatment of patients 
with GIST. A phase 1 study, DCC-2618-01-001, (data extracted at the data cut-off date; 01 Mar 2019)  
which an ongoing dose escalation/dose expansion (FIH) study and the Phase 3 Study DCC-2618-03-
001 (INVICTUS) for which enrolment is completed and with data cut-off 31 May 2019 (data extracted 
at the data cut-off date) presenting the results for the primary analysis.  
The currently proposed indication is: 
Qinlock is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
(GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
Assessment of the efficacy of ripretinib will be based on two studies, the Dose-Response study DCC-
2618-01-001 and the Phase 3, pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001, presented separately. 
An additional Phase 3 study, DCC-2618-03-002 (INTRIGUE), will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
quality of life (QoL) of ripretinib versus (vs.) sunitinib in second line GIST.

2.5.1.1.  Dose-response study 
Study DCC-2618-01-001, initiated in 2015, is phase 1, open-label study evaluating increasing doses of 
ripretinib (Escalation phase), administered as single-agent day 1-28 in repeated 28-day cycles. All 
patients had advanced malignancies, required to have received approved treatments known to provide 
clinical benefit prior to study entry and presenting a molecular rationale for activity. First patient 
enroled 12 Nov 2015. At DCO, 01 Mar 2019, the study was ongoing and continued to enrol and treat 
patients in the Expansion Phase to assess the clinical endpoints for all the protocol-defined disease 
cohorts. Interim data analyses in patients with advanced GIST from the interim clinical study report 
(CSR) are presented in this assessment. Following the dose-escalation phase, the dose-expansion 
phase included different disease cohorts including GIST, SM and other hematologic malignancies, 
malignant gliomas, melanomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and other solid tumour types associated with 
genomic alterations of KIT, PDGFR (A or B), TIE2, CSF1R, or VEGFR2. The clinical activity analyses 
were based on the ITT population.  
Key Inclusion criteria: criteria specific to patients with GIST were a KIT or PDGFRA mutation and 
documented progression on or intolerability to at least 1 line of systemic anti-cancer therapy. Patients 
were to have an ECOG PS of 0 to 2 at screening and with at least 1 measurable lesion according to 
response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) Version 1.1. Archival tumour tissue sample (if 
no anticancer therapy had been administered since the sample collection; otherwise, a fresh tumour 
tissue sample was required prior to the first dose), were to be obtained. 
Key exclusion criteria: GIST patients with wild type or unknown KIT or PDGFRA status, prior anti-
cancer treatments within 14 days, Class II-IV heart disease; arterial or venous thrombotic events 
within 6 or 3 months, respectively or prolonged QTcf interval, clinically significant co-morbidities; 
malabsorption syndromes; pregnant or lactating women. 
As of Amendment 1 (03 SEPTEMBER 2015), patients were not required to have received all available 
treatment options following progression on imatinib. As of Amendment 5 (03 NOVEMBER 2017) a

clarification with respect to intra-patient dose-escalation from 150 mg QD to 150 mg BID, upon 
progressive disease, was included. 
2.5.1.1.1.  Statistical Methods 
The Safety population included all patients who received any investigational product. The safety 
population was the primary set for analysis of safety data. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population includes patients in the safety population, excluding those who 
only participated in the food effect portion. The clinical activity analyses were based on the ITT 
population. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population includes all patients in Safety Population who have at least one non-
missing PK concentration. 
Data collected in the Escalation Phase was summarized by dose initially assigned, in each disease 
group and in all patients. Pooled data from the Escalation Phase and Expansion Phase were analyzed in 
an analogous manner. 
For GIST patients, additional analysis was done by line of therapy (2nd, 3rd, 4th, >4th, and ≥4th) for 
data collected in the Expansion Phase, and for pooled data from the Escalation and Expansion Phases 
in the following subgroups defined by dose initially assigned, 1) Initial dose = 150 mg QD; 2) Initial 
daily dose ≥ 100 mg 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) were used to 
describe continuous variables. Discrete variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages. 
As of the interim analysis, summary tabulations were presented for all safety data collected by the 
data cut-off date in all patients, and for efficacy data from Cycle 1 Day 1 to the first disease 
progression date or by the data cut-off date in GIST patients. At the interim analysis, safety data of all 
disease groups collected by the data cutoff date will be analyzed. Since the proposed indication is 4th 
line GIST for the NDA submission and the enrolment will not be completed for the other disease 
cohorts (other solid tumours, melanomas, soft tissue sarcomas, germ cell tumours, penile cancer, non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and GIST and other solid tumours with renal impairment.) at the data 
cutoff date, the efficacy analysis will focus on the GIST patients. 
Sample size 
KIT or PDGFRA Mutant GIST cohorts: 
Expansion Cohort 1: 4th Line  
Up to 40 patients were to be enroled. A continuous monitoring plan was developed to halt enrolment 
into this cohort if the observed median PFS was lower than the assumed median PFS of 2 months. 
There are no approved treatment options for 4th line (or later) patients. The assumption of 2 months 
represented the potential benefit of re-challenge of imatinib. For logistical reasons, every 2 weeks the 
cumulative number of patients that were enroled into this cohort and the number of patients that 
progressed or died within 2 months of enrolment was calculated. Assuming that the true median PFS 
was 2 months, if the probability of observing the number of patients that progressed or died within 2 
months of enrolment (or more) out of the cumulative number of patients that were enroled is less than 
0.05, then enrolment into the cohort was to be halted since the true median PFS was likely less than 
the hypothesized 2 months. Patients already enroled continued to be treated and followed per protocol. 
Expansion Cohort 2: >4th Line 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 68/134 
 
 
 
Up to 35 patients were to be enroled. A monitoring plan similar to the one developed for Expansion 
Cohort 1 was used with the same assumptions for median PFS and duration of enrolment. The 
operating characteristics for this scheme were similar to those for Expansion Cohort 1. 
Expansion Cohort 3: 2nd and 3rd Lines 
Up to 55 patients were to be enroled into this cohort, at least 25 of these patients should have been 
second line patients. A monitoring plan similar to the one developed for the previous 2 cohorts was 
used. Based on the assumption that the majority of enroled patients represented third line patients, 
the hypothesized median PFS in this cohort was 3.5 months and the duration of enrolment was 8 
months. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
There were some changes from the planned analysis in the protocol, these were the ITT Population 
was defined to replace the Per-Protocol population as the main analysis set for the clinical activity of 
the study drug, disease control rate was reported at additional time points, the endpoint “time to best 
response” was changed to “time to response,” a commonly used nomenclature in oncology clinical 
trials, an interim analysis was conducted to support the New Drug Application of the study drug in 
GIST patients.  
The protocol has evolved over time with several amendments and the statistical analysis plan was 
finalized after the data cut-off for the interim analysis the submission is based on. The statistical 
analysis plan version 3 is dated 30 May 2019, the main change from the brief statistical analysis plan 
in the study protocol is the analysis population for efficacy data which is changed from a per protocol 
to an ITT population including all treated patients. This analysis population is considered the most 
relevant and the change is supported.  
The interim analysis to support filing had a data cut-off of March 1, 2019. It is not clear when the 
timing of the interim analysis was decided and where documented. In last protocol amendment (v.7, 
20 Dec 2018) it is stated that data cuts will be made, and interim efficacy and safety data will be 
summarized to support clinical presentations and potential regulatory submissions. Whilst the lack of 
pre-specification can cause concerns this study does not play the role of a pivotal study.

Part 1 Dose-escalation Phase  
The study was initiated in 2015. Patients received ripretinib QD in 28-day cycles. A 3+3 dose 
escalation design was used and doses from 20 mg to 200 mg BID and 100, 150 and 250 mg QD were 
evaluated. 
The selection ripretinib of dose, for the expansion phase, of 150 mg QD, was based on in vivo and in 
vitro pharmacology studies. 150 mg QD was predicted to maintain the PK exposure above the 
presumed threshold for efficacy in >90% of patients. Ripretinib single-dose PK parameters derived 
from non-compartmental analysis were generally dose proportional within the dose range of 20 to 150 
mg, but less than dose proportional for Cmax at higher doses of 200 and 250 mg. DP-5439 exposure 
generally increased as dose increased, but the increase appeared to be less than dose proportional. 
Furthermore, safety data during the Escalation Phase displayed three dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
including Grade 3 lipase increased (n=2) and Grade 4 creatine kinase increased (n=1). No maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was reached as there were <33% of DLTs at each dose level explored. 
 Data with respect to cfDNA KIT mutational allele frequency, from in vitro studies as well as data from 
the dose-escalation phase, support the choice of RP2D.   
Part 2 Dose-expansion Phase 
The expansion phase of the study was initiated in 2017, using the RP2D, in order to further evaluate 
the safety, PK, PD, and evidence of anti-tumour activity across a variety of tumours with evidence of 
alterations in genes that are targets of ripretinib. Out of 10 planned cohorts, three included patients 
with GIST with KIT or PDGFRA mutation (also imatinib resistant mutations including KIT Exon 17 and 
PDGFRA D842V), that had progressed on or were intolerant to at least 1 line of systemic anticancer 
therapy.  
All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis.  
The interim CSR with a DCO on 01 Mar 2019, was based on the assessment of available data after 
completed enrolment of patients in 5 of the 10 planned cohorts. Once all cohorts are completely 
enroled additional analyses will be conducted on the entire study population and reported in a final 
CSR or separate report. Cohorts 1 through 3, in which GIST patients were included, are relevant for 
the present assessment.

•Expansion Cohort 2 (>4th line): up to 35 planned; 36 enroled 
•Expansion Cohort 3 (2nd and 3rd lines): up to 55 planned, at least 25 of these patients should have 
been second line patients; 55 enroled

• To determine allele fraction of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in plasma cfDNA and compare it with 
mutation allele fraction in GIST tumour tissue and their association with prior treatment and study 
drug response  
Exploratory Objectives 
• To investigate the effects of ripretinib on selected pharmacodynamic parameters  
• To determine allele fraction of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using NGS 
technique and compare it with mutation allele fraction in GIST tumour tissue and their association with 
prior treatment and study drug response 
• To assess polymorphic variations in genes encoding drug metabolic enzymes and/or transporters 
involved in metabolism and disposition of ripretinib and DP-5439 and/or in genes that may potentially 
be associated with clinical response and/or study drug related toxicity 
• To assess metabolic tumour response by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria in 
selected patients 
As of 01 Mar 2019, a total of 237 patients were enroled and received at least 1 dose of ripretinib 
during the dose escalation and expansion phases. At DCO there were 71 patients still on study 
treatment (12 (17%) patients in escalation phase; 59 (35%) patients in expansion phase). Of those, 
181 patients in the escalation and expansion phases, who received ripretinib 150 mg QD, 117 (64.6%) 
patients discontinued from treatment and 64 (35.4%) patients were ongoing. Primary reasons for 
treatment discontinuation were progressive disease (66 patients; 36.5%) and adverse event (16 
patients; 8.8%). 
The cohorts included patients with GIST, receiving study drug ripretinib as 2nd- or 3rd-, 4th- or >4th line 
treatment and data on prior therapies for the treatment of GIST for those who received the ripretinib 
150 mg QD dose show: 31 patients receiving ripretinib as 2nd line treatment, 28 patients receiving 
ripretinib as 3rd line treatment and 83 patients ripretinib as ≥4th line treatment. Furthermore, all 
patients, but 5 out of the 142 patients (96,5%), had received earlier treatment with TKIs. The type of 
last prior line of therapy was not presented, but none or very few of the patients had CR or PR as Best 
Overall Response to last prior therapy. A majority of the patients had discontinued their prior 
treatment due to progressive disease. 
There were few patents discontinuing ripretinib treatment or study participation due to AEs. The most 
common reason for treatment discontinuations was progressive disease and the most common reason 
for study discontinuation was death. At DCO, 38.7% of the patients were still ongoing. 
The evaluation of the antitumour activity of ripretinib included objective response rate (ORR) and 
disease control rate (DCR). Other endpoints included time to response (TTR), progression-free survival 
(PFS), and duration of response (DOR). 
The median follow-up for ripretinib 150 mg QD dose (n=142) was 9.69 months, irrespective of line of 
therapy. The median relative dose intensity of ripretinib were comparable, irrespective of line of 
therapy.

Kaplan-Meier Plot of PFS by Line of Therapy in Patients with GIST Receiving an Initially 
Assigned Dose of 150 mg QD in Escalation and Expansion Phases (ITT Population) 
Tumour regression was assessed by CT scans, however, up to Amendment 3, in addition, PET scans 
were performed. For the dose-escalation phase, partial metabolic response was seen across all dose-
levels, however, a discrimination between doses was, however, not feasible. Furthermore, in patients 
progressing on the RP2D 150 mg ripretinib QD in the dose expansion phase and subsequently dose-
escalated to 150 mg BID, partial metabolic response was seen in most of the 37 patients evaluable, 
regardless of line of therapy. 
Tumour tissue KIT and PDGFR mutations available at study entry were a mix of mutation status at 
diagnosis, after last previous anticancer treatment and from the time of study entry, therefore do not 
necessarily represent mutation status at time of study entry for all patients. Mutation data were mainly 
presented for KIT and shows that KIT mutations were found in ~90% of the tissue samples and 
somewhat less in the cfDNA samples, without discriminating any differences with respect to line of 
treatment, and mainly found in exon 13 and 17. Analyses of association of specific mutations in 
tumour DNA with response to ripretinib and mutational status at the time of progression have not been 
performed.

With respect to overall responses, there were no CRs. For all patients, escalation and expansion 
phases, (n=142), treated with ripretinib 150 mg QD, the ORR was 11.3%, compared to 14.3% for 
those who received ripretinib as the 3rd line therapy (n=28), 10.9% for those who received ripretinib 
as their 4th line therapy and 7.2% for those who received ripretinib as the ≥4th line therapy (N=83). 
For those patients who received ripretinib as 2nd line treatment (n=31) the ORR was 19.4%.  
In comparison, it was noted that the same 142 patient cohort had an ORR (CR and PR) of 2.8% to 
their last prior treatment.  
The disease control rate (response or stable disease), DCR, at 26 weeks were 45.9 % for all patients, 
60% for 2nd line 55.6% for line 3rd line, 45.5% for 4th line and 37.2% for ≥4th line. At 52 weeks the DCR 
was 23.2% for all patients vs 17.6% for ≥4th line.  
The probability of maintaining response status (all patients) at 52 weeks was 85.7% (95% CI 53.9, 
96.2). 
The KM estimate shows a median (50th percentile) of PFS at 23.9 weeks (95%CI = 15.9, 24.3) in GIST 
patients who received 150 mg QD as the ≥4th line of therapy (n=83, by INV) The probability of 
maintaining PFS for 52 weeks was 21.7% (95% CI of 13.1%, 31.6%). The median (50th percentile) 
PFS was 41.7 weeks for 2nd line patients and 36.3 weeks for 3rd line patients. 
PFS by line of therapy showed a separation of the curves of each line of therapy.  
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR was 76.1 weeks (95% CI 24.1, not estimable) among the 6 
responders (PR; > 30% tumour size reduction) who received 150 mg QD as the ≥4th line of therapy in 
the Escalation and Expansion phases.  
2.5.1.2.  Main study 
DCC-2618-03-001 
Study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) is an ongoing, Phase 3, 2-arm, randomised, placebo controlled, 
double-blind, international, multicentre study comparing the efficacy of ripretinib + BSC  to placebo + 
BSC  in patients who had received previous treatments with at least 3 prior TKI therapies (imatinib, 
sunitinib, and regorafenib). Data cut-off: 31 May 2019.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 74/134 
 
 
 
 
INVICTUS provides the primary data in support for the clinical efficacy of ripretinib. The target dos, 
150 mg QD, was based on RP2D chosen based on data from the escalation phase in the dose-response 
study DCC-2618-01-001. 
Tumour assessments were performed using the GIST specific mRECIST criteria Version 1.1 (modified 
with respect to non-nodal or non-bone target lesions, Demitri et al 2013b) and based on independent 
radiologic review (IRR). 
Study Design 
A total of 129 subjects were enroled for treatment in the double-blind period and all 129 were analysed 
in the ITT population. The study was performed in 12 countries; US [47%], Canada, Australia, 
Singapore. From the EU [44%] (France Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, UK and 
Belgium). 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria were adult patient, with a histological GIST diagnosis, required to have 
progressed on imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib or have documented intolerance to any of these 
treatments despite recommended dose modifications. Access to archival tumour tissue sample if no 
anticancer therapy had been administered since the sample collection; otherwise, a fresh tumour 
tissue sample. ECOG PS of 0 to 2 and adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve. 
The key exclusion criteria were concurrent malignancy, CNS metastasis, NYHA II-IV, uncontrolled 
hypertension or heart failure, thrombo-embolic events within 6 months, LVEF <50% and 
gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., post-operative consequences), QTcF prolongation or history of 
long QT syndrome; LVEF <50%, or any medication that could interfere with the assessment of 
ripretinib.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to ripretinib 150 QD (as 50 mg strength tablets), orally, 
with or without food) or to placebo. 
Subjects were to be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 
loss to follow
up, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment due to any other reason. Dose 
reduction occurred in reductions of 50 mg. 
‐
The study had two main treatment periods, the double-blind treatment analysis period in which 
patients received their randomised assigned treatment and the open-label treatment analysis period 
for patients with progressive disease, either crossing over from the placebo arm or patients who 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 75/134 
 
 
 
 
 
continued receiving ripretinib, either as initially assigned, 150 mg QD or after dose-escalation to 150 
mg ripretinib BID.  
Prohibited medications and other restrictions 
The following medications were excluded during the study: Proton pump inhibitors, strong or moderate 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, including certain herbal medications (e.g., St. John’s Wort), 
grapefruit or grapefruit juice; known substrates or inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
transporters, anticancer therapies, including investigational therapy. 
In order to mitigate the potential risk of photo-irritation/phototoxicity, patients were instructed to 
avoid strong sunlight, sunlamps, and other sources of ultraviolet radiation for the duration of the 
study. Prophylactic skin care recommendations for all patients on study drug included sunscreen with 
SPF ≥ 30, hypoallergenic moisturizing creams or ointments for dry skin, and gentle skincare with 
fragrance-free soaps and detergents. 
Objectives/ endpoints 
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy (PFS) of ripretinib by independent radiologic 
review (IRR, by mRECIST v 1.1) in patients with advanced GIST who had received prior anticancer 
therapies. 
The secondary objectives were to determine the ORR (key) by IRR, to assess TTP, OS, DoR, and 
DCR, to assess the PK/PD relationship of ripretinib and to assess the robustness of efficacy using a 
sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, to assess the safety of ripretinib and disease-related symptoms and 
quality of life.  
Main exploratory endpoints were assessment of ripretinib efficacy on dose escalation to ripretinib 
150 mg twice daily (BID). To characterize KIT and PDGFRA gene resistance mutations (and potentially 
other gene mutations) and their ripretinib-driven longitudinal mutation allele frequency (MAF) changes 
in plasma cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA).  Furthermore, to retrospectively correlate KIT and 
PDGFRA mutation/s and/or their frequency (as well as of potentially other gene mutations) in baseline 
cfDNA with clinical benefit and to understand potential TKI-resistance mechanisms of GIST at time of 
progression.  
Exploratory objectives as characterization of KIT and PDGFRA gene resistance mutations and their 
ripretinib-driven longitudinal MAF changes in plasma cfDN, is planned and results will be presented 
post-approval.  
Randomisation and blinding 
Subjects in this study were randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, into the 2 treatment arms and the 
randomization was stratified by 3 prior anticancer treatments versus ≥ 4 prior anticancer treatments 
and ECOG = 0 versus ECOG = 1 or 2. The randomisation procedure and the stratifications, appears 
appropriate.  
2.5.1.2.1.  Statistical methods 
Based on the study design, there are two main analysis periods:  
• Double-blind treatment analysis period included the period from the randomization date to the last 
follow-up date for patients who discontinued from the study upon disease progression (by IRR) on 
initial treatment or discontinuation from initial treatment due to other cause OR from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 76/134 
 
 
 
randomization date to the first disease progression date, (this applies to patients who continued to 
receive ripretinib at 150mg QD or an escalated dose, 150 mg BID, or those who crossed over from 
placebo to receive ripretinib at 150mg QD after disease progression on initial treatment). 
• Open-label analysis period included the period from the day immediately after the first disease 
progression (by IRR) on initial treatment to the last follow-up date for patients who continued to 
receive ripretinib 150mg QD or at an escalated dose and those who crossed over from placebo to 
receive ripretinib150mg QD after disease progression on initial treatment. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, progression-free survival, was defined and analysed only during the 
double-blind treatment analysis period. 
Overall survival is defined and analysed throughout patients’ entire study period. The data cut-off for 
the primary analysis was planned to occur when 90 PFS events had occurred. It was expected that the 
primary analysis would occur approximately 6 months after last patient’s enrolment. 
Analysis populations 
The Intention-to-treat Population (ITT) population is defined as all patients who signed the informed 
consent and were randomized. The ITT population will be used for all efficacy analysis as a primary 
analysis set with treatment assignment based on randomization. 
The Safety population is defined as all patients who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
safety population will be used for all safety analyses with treatment actually received.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as randomized patients who do not have important protocol 
deviations that are expected to compromise the efficacy and/or safety assessments. 
The PK population will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of ripretinib and 
had at least 1 non-missing PK concentration in plasma reported for ripretinib or DP-5439. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of PFS (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date of 
randomization and the earliest documented evidence of the first disease progression based on the 
independent radiologic review or death due to any cause on initially assigned study treatment, 
whichever comes earlier. In the following situations, PFS will be re-defined otherwise or censored: 
• 
• 
• 
For patients who do not have evaluable radio logic assessment (including those randomized but 
untreated due to death or any other cause), PFS will be censored at randomization date (PFS=1 
day) unless they die within 2 cycles of treatment (8 weeks plus 3 days allowing for a late radio 
logic assessment within the visit window). If patients die within 2 cycles of treatment (8 weeks 
plus 3 days), they are considered to have a PFS event at death date 
For patients who only have non-measurable lesion according to modified RECIST Version 1.1 (non-
nodal lesions must be ≥1.0 cm in the long axis or ≥double the slide thickness in   the long axis) 
within 21 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, PFS will be censored at the date of latest 
evaluable progression-free radio logic assessment or patients will be considered to have disease 
progression at the date of new lesion(s) or unequivocal progression in non-target disease 
For patients who undergo surgical resection of target or non-target lesions, who have received 
other anticancer treatments than the study treatment before documented date of the first disease 
progression, PFS will be censored at the date of the   latest evaluable progression-free radiologic 
assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 77/134 
 
 
 
• 
• 
For patients who have not progressed and have not died, PFS will be censored at the time of the 
latest date of evaluable progression-free radio logic assessment if   at most one missed/non-
evaluable assessment prior to this assessment 
For patients who have first disease progression or die after two or more consecutive missed/non-
evaluable assessments, the patient will be censored at the time of the evaluable radiologic 
assessment immediately prior to the two or more consecutive missed/non-evaluable radiologic 
assessments. The missed/non-evaluable assessments include both the scheduled assessments 
when a patient was on treatment and the hypothetical assessments (the expected assessments as 
if the patient was still on treatment) after a patient discontinued treatment or withdrew for reasons 
other than progressed disease. For patients who have first disease progression documented 
between scheduled assessments, progression date is defined as the date of new lesion (if 
progression is due to new lesions) or defined as the earliest of the scan dates of the components   
that triggered the progression per independent radio logic review (if progression is due to increase 
in sum of measured lesions).  
Analysis for PFS will be stratified by the randomization stratification factors [prior lines of therapy (3 
versus ≥4) and ECOG (0 versus 1 or 2)]. The p-value will be from a 2-sided stratified Log-rank test at 
0.05 significant level for evaluation of treatment difference. Point estimate of hazard ratio will be 
obtained from a Cox regression model with treatment and the randomization stratification factors as 
fixed factors and it’s 95% CI will be obtained using Wald method. PFS time will be summarized via KM 
methodology using the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles and pre-specified timepoints, each 
with associated 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses will be performed using the ITT population 
as the primary efficacy analysis and PP population as supportive.   
Secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint, ORR, is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the independent radiologic review and during the 
initial assigned study treatment. This analysis will be performed in the ITT population as the main 
analysis and the PP population as supportive analysis. To be assigned a status of a CR or PR, changes 
in tumour measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that must be performed at least 4 
weeks (allowing a minus 3-day window) after the criteria for response are first met. This analysis will 
include assessments prior to an event or censoring under the primary PFS analysis. Patients with 
unknown or missing response will be categorized as non-responders and will be included in the 
denominator when calculating the proportion. An unstratified two-sided Fisher’s Exact test at a 0.05 
significance level will be used to investigate statistical differences between treatment groups. A 95% 
Newcombe score confidence interval will be constructed for the treatment rate difference in ORR 
(Newcombe, 1998) A sensitivity analysis will be performed for ORR without requiring confirmation of 
CR and PR. 
Time to Progression (TTP, reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date of 
randomization and the earliest documented evidence of first disease progression on initial treatment 
based on the independent radiologic review. Since dying without progression is a competing risk of 
progression, TTP is censored at death date for patients who died without disease progression. 
Additionally, in the following situations, TTP will be re-defined otherwise or censored: 
• 
For patients who do not have evaluable radio logic assessment, TTP will be censored at 
randomization date (TTP=1 day) unless they die within 2 cycles of treatment (8 weeks plus 3 days 
allowing for a late radio logic assessment within the visit window). If patients die within 2 cycles of 
treatment (8 weeks plus 3 days), TTP will be censored at death date

•

• 
• 
• 
For patients who only have nonmeasurable lesion according to modified RECIST Version 1.1 (non-
nodal lesions must be ≥1.0 cm in the long axis or ≥double the slide thickness in the long axis) 
within 21 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, TTP will be censored at the date of latest 
evaluable progression-free radiologic assessment or patients will be considered to have disease 
progression at the date of new lesion(s) or unequivocal progression in non-target disease 
For patients who undergo surgical resection of target or non-target lesions, who have received 
other anticancer treatments than the study treatment before documented date of the first disease 
progression, TTP will be censored at the date of the latest evaluable progression-free radiologic 
assessment 
For patients who have not progressed, TTP will be censored at the time of the latest date of 
evaluable progression-free radiologic assessment if at most one missed/non-evaluable assessment 
prior to this assessment 
For patients who have first disease progression after two or more consecutive missed/non-
evaluable scheduled or hypothetical assessments, TTP will be censored at the time of the evaluable 
radio logic assessment immediately prior to the two or more consecutive missed/non-evaluable 
scheduled or hypothetical radiologic assessments 
For patients who have first disease progression documented between scheduled assessments, 
progression date is defined as the date of new lesion (if progression is due to new lesions) or 
defined as the earliest of the scan dates of the components that triggered the progression per 
independent radiologic review (if progression is due to increase in sum of measured lesions) 
TTP will be analyzed in a similar fashion to PFS.  
Overall survival (OS, reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date of randomization 
and date of death from any cause. Patients who are still alive or who are lost to follow-up will be 
censored at the date of last contact. OS will be analyzed during the entire study period in a similar 
fashion to PFS. 
The time to response, based on the independent radio logic review, is defined as the interval between 
the date of randomization and the earliest date of first documented confirmed CR or earliest date of 
first documented confirmed PR if the patient does not have confirmed CR. Patients who do not have a 
confirmed PR or CR will be censored at the date of the last assessment during the double-blind 
treatment analysis period. Time to response will be summarized and displayed using KM methods in a 
manner similar to the primary analysis of PFS. 
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 will be summarized by scale. In all scales, a high scale score represents a higher 
response level. The scoring for this questionnaire will be done in 2 steps. First, calculate the average of 
the items that contribute to the scale. This will be used as the raw score for the scale, and secondly, 
apply a linear transformation to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. 
Changes from baseline to Day 1 of Cycle 2 in EORTC-QLQ-C30 Role function and Physical function will 
be compared between the two treatment arms using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the 
stratification factors as factors. If Day 1 of Cycle 2 value is missing, then the change from baseline to 
the end of initial study treatment will be used in the analysis. 
EQ-5D-5L will be summarized overall by number and percentage for each level of each dimension. For 
pain/discomfort and usual activities, the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test will be used to test the change 
in response scale at Day 1 of Cycle 2 from baseline between DCC- 2618 and placebo. For EQ-5D-5L 
index (utility) score, an ANCOVA model with the stratification factors as factors will be used to compare 
the change at Day 1 of Cycle 2 from baseline between the two treatment arms. EQ-VAS will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021

summarized using continuous descriptive statistics. Change in EQ-VAS score at Day 1 of Cycle 2 from 
baseline between the two treatment arms will be tested with a t-test. 
Multiplicity 
To control familywise type-I error, the hypothesis tests for treatment difference between ripretinib and 
placebo will be performed at two-sided 0.05 level of significance sequentially in the following order:  
1.  The primary endpoint PFS based on independent radiologic review 
2.  The key secondary endpoint ORR based on independent radio logic review 
3.  OS 
4.  QOL as determined by changes from baseline to Day 1 of Cycle 2 in EORTC-QLQ-C30 Role function 
and Physical function (each at 0.025 level of significance)  
If any hypothesis test is not significant at alpha=0.05 level, the subsequently listed analyses will be 
viewed as descriptive. 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analysis will be performed for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints defined by 
the following variables: 
•  Age (18 – 64 vs 65 – 74 vs 75 years or older)  
•  Gender (Male vs female) 
•  Race (White vs non-White vs not- reported)  
•  Region (US vs non-US) 
•  Screening ECOG (0 vs 1/2)  
•  Number of prior therapies (3 vs ≥4) 
Open label analysis period 
The open-label analysis period will be further split into 2 sub-periods, prior to intra-patient dose 
escalation and post intra-patient dose escalation 
Days on ripretinib treatment within the open-label analysis period for patients that crossed over to 
ripretinib will be defined from the first dose date after crossover. 
Efficacy analysis during the open-label analysis period will be explored by analysis sub-periods.  For 
patients who initially received placebo and subsequently crossed over to ripretinib treatment, PFS in 
the “Prior to intra-patient dose escalation” sub-period will be defined as the time interval from the date 
of the first dose of ripretinib to the earliest documented evidence of disease progression.  PFS will be 
re-defined or censored as needed and analysed in a similar fashion to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Amendments 
There was a clinically important amendment (Amend. 3, 22 Mar 2018) when Patients with known KIT 
or PDGFRA wild-type GIST could be included.

There were 129 patients enroled in the double-blind period in the ITT population. One patient was 
randomized to placebo but was never treated, and therefore not included in the safety population. 
Overall, 30 of 129 patients (17 [20.0%] patients in the ripretinib arm and 13 [30.2%] patients in the 
placebo arm) discontinued treatment during the double-blind period. During the double-blind period, 
the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were clinical progression (4.7% and 7.0% in 
the ripretinib and placebo arm respectively) and death (3.5% and 9.3% in the ripretinib and placebo 
arm, respectively) and AE (3,5% and 4,7% in the ripretinib and placebo arm respectively).  
Out of 29 patients discontinuing the study during the double-blind phase, 25 was due to death, 14,1% 
and 29.5% in the ripretinib and placebo arm, respectively. 
At DCO, 31 May 2019, 27 patients (21.1%), 26 patients vs one patient from the original ripretinib arm 
and placebo arm, respectively, were still receiving the blinded treatment. 
Open-label Period  
Patient Disposition (Safety Population) 
There were 71 (55.5%) patients that had disease progression and entered the open-label period, 
including 42 (49.4%) patients from the ripretinib arm and 29 (67.4%) patients from the placebo arm. 
Thirty-one patients receiving ripretinib 150 mg QD during the double-blind period, dose escalated to 
ripretinib 150 mg BID. Furthermore, 10 patients who crossed over to ripretinib upon progressive 
disease, subsequently dose escalated to receive 150 mg BID. 
The main reason for treatment discontinuation during the open-label period, was progressive disease 
and the main reason for study discontinuation was due to death.

Baseline data 
Demographics 
The demographics and baseline characteristics were overall balanced. Overall, there was a slight male 
predominance, 75% were white and more than 90% had an ECOG score ≤1. The median age for all 
subjects was 60 years, however, there was a higher median age in the placebo group compared to the 
ripretinib group (64.5 years vs 59 years in the placebo group and ripretinib group respectively), 
specifically pronounced the group of 75 years or older (22.7% vs 9.4% in the ripretinib arm). 
Inclusion allowed patients with ECOG PS 0-2, however, only 8.5% of the included patients belonged to 
the group of ECOG 2, with 63% having received 3 prior lines of therapy (37% ≥ 4 prior lines) and with 
a large proportion of elderly patients, 25% 65-74 years and 14% ≥75 years.   
The median time since initial diagnosis was 5.69 years and very similar for both arms.  
Tumour mutation 
It is known that over 80% of GIST patients eventually develop disease progression driven by 
secondary-resistance mutations, located in additional KIT exons and PDGFRA, which constitutes the 
key reasons for resistance development in GIST. Genomic alteration of KIT/PDGFRA was planned to be 
retrospectively analyzed via central testing of tumour tissue after the inclusion. The CSR describes the 
mutational status for patients when included in the INVICTUS study. The most common genomic 
alteration (KIT/PDGFRA) was KIT exon 11 (58.1%), the second most common was KIT exon 9 
mutations. Other than KIT exon 9 and 11 mutations were seen in only 3.1% and PDGFRA mutations 
2.3%. However, these data do not necessarily reflect the full mutational complexity expected in ≥4th 
line GIST.  
KIT and PDGFRA wild type GIST were reported for 7.8% of the included subjects (inclusion as of 
Amendment 3).  
Prior systemic therapy 
All patients had received at least 3 prior systemic anticancer therapies, i.e., the minimum stipulated by 
treatment inclusion criteria (imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib), thirty-three (25.6%) patients had 
received 4 prior systemic therapies and 10 (7.8%) patients had 5 prior systemic therapies, i.e., the 
median number of prior treatments was 3. Eighty percent of the patients randomized to ripretinib had 
relapsed during the previous TKI treatment, while 23.5% were non-responders to the last previous 
therapy.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The analyses presented are based on the primary analysis with a data cut-off date of 31 May 2019. 
Treatment and follow-up are ongoing. For the double-blind period, compliance ≥ 80% was seen in 84 
(98.8%) patients in the ripretinib arm and 36 (83.7%) patients in the placebo arm, which is 
acceptable.  
Please refer to the tabulated summary below for key outcomes.

Primary endpoint: IRR-assessed PFS for ripretinib arm vs placebo, using a 2-sided stratified 
Log-rank test and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors (prior lines of therapy [3 
vs. ≥4] and ECOG PS [0 vs.1 or 2]).

Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival Based on IRR in Double-blind Period (ITT 
Population) 
At DCO the event rate was 84.1% in the control arm vs 60% for the ripretinib arm, the primary 
outcome showed a HR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.09, 0.25): p<0,001 in favor of the ripretinib arm (the median 
FU for the double-blind period was not presented). Median PFS was 27.6 weeks (95% CI 20.0, 29.9) in 
the ripretinib arm compared to 4.1 weeks (95% CI 4.0, 7.3) in the placebo arm. Patients in the 
ripretinib arm had an 85% reduced risk of disease progression or death. This estimation is based on 
18.8% progressive disease events and 14.1% deaths in the experimental arm, with the corresponding 
figures for the control arm being 63.6% and 29.5%, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 84/134 
 
 
 
 
Since the number of PFS events included in the primary analysis (88 events) was less than the planned 
90 events, an O’Brien-Fleming method was used to assess the robustness of the result. The alpha level 
was adjusted to be 0.047 and the hypothesis test of PFS (p<0.0001) still remained highly statistically 
significant at the adjusted alpha level. 
In terms of HR for PFS, the subgroup analyses consistently favour the experimental arm, including the 
stratification groups (ECOG 0 vs 1 or 2) with a HR of 0.33 and 0.10, respectively, and number of prior 
treatments 3 vs ≥4 with a HR of 0.15 and 0.24, respectively. In addition, the median PFS for 
KIT/PDGFRA WT patients receiving ripretinib was 5.7 months, while the median PFS for KIT/PDGFRA 
WT patients receiving placebo was 2.1 months. 
The results for ORR by age subgroup based on independent radiological review are summarized above. 
No responses were observed in patients 75 years or older. Among patients in the 18-64 years and 65-
74 years subgroups, the ripretinib arm showed consistent benefit (difference is >0). 
Sensitivity analysis of PSF by investigator assessment showed a discordance between IRR and INV 
assessed PFS on overall 20.2% in the double-blind period. The differences went in both directions,

however, the evaluation of progressive disease vs no progressive disease is obviously complex in GIST, 
with no bone lesions or no lymph nodes chosen as targets, instead the sources of assessments are 
estimations of solid or partly solid, heterogeneous masses (reflecting the presence of hemorrhage or 
cystic degeneration). The mRECIST allows for this assessment under these conditions. 
Considering the complex circumstances of response assessment, the discordance, between IRR and 
INV, seems acceptable. 
Additional sensitivity analyses were made for the PP population, i.e., PFS excluding subjects with 
important protocol deviations, HR 0.13 (95% CI [3] 0.08, 0.23) and the safety population, HR 0.15 
(95% CI [3] 0.09, 0.25). The PFS result seems robust. 
•  Key secondary endpoint: ORR by IRR (alpha-controlled) unstratified two-sided Fisher’s Exact 
test at a 0.05 significance level 
ORR was based on IRR and during the initial assigned study treatment. The analysis was performed in 
the ITT population as the main analysis and the PP population as supportive analysis.  
Summary of Objective Response Based on IRR in Double-blind Period (ITT Population)  
The ORR in the ripretinib arm was 9.4 % vs 0% in the control arm, there were no CRs. Statistical 
significance at the 5% level was not achieved for the key secondary endpoint ORR (p=0.0504).  
The rate of SD (≥6 weeks) was 65.9% in the ripretinib arm vs 20.5% in the control arm. 
In terms of subgroup analysis of ORR, all groups were in favour of the ripretinib group. The most 
pronounced difference within a subgroup of is seen by gender and region.  
The ORR in the PP population supports the overall results of ORR in the ITT population.  
The ORR based on INV supported the overall ORR results by IRR. Statistical significance was not 
achieved for the key secondary endpoint ORR, and the hypothesis testing for the secondary endpoint 
OS, was therefore, not formally performed. 
The OS data is presented according to the initial randomization assignment but defined and analysed 
throughout patients’ entire on-study period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 86/134 
 
 
 
 
Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival (ITT Population) 
At data cut off the median OS was reached in both arms and the data is considered mature, 40% of 
the total death events had occurred. In the ripretinib arm 26 (30,6%) patients had died and 59 
patients (69.4%) were censored, while in the placebo arm 26 (59.1%) had died and 18 (40.9%) were 
censored.  
The median OS was 65.6 (CI 95% 53.6, 65.6) weeks for the ripretinib arm 28.6 (CI 95% 17.9, 50.4) 
weeks for the placebo arm. The OS data is confounded by censoring and the cross-over design. 
However, the risk of death was reduced by 64% in the arm with upfront ripretinib treatment, 
compared to the placebo arm, (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.21, 0.62); stratified log-rank test nominal p = 
0.0004, (not statistically significant due to the prespecified hierarchical alfa-spending plan for the 
secondary endpoints). 
At 26, 39 and 52 weeks the survival rate was 84,3%, 71,2 and 65,4% in the ripretinib arm and 55.9%, 
43.1% and 25,9% in the placebo arm, respectively, a clear difference in support for the ripretinib 
treatment, which is illustrated by the KM curve.  
•  Median time to TTR is 8.1 weeks. The period from 4-8 weeks, counted from baseline, is also 
reflected in the PFS curve, for the ripretinib group this represents the period during which 
tumour growth decelerates and stabilizes in the ripretinib group while, for the placebo group, 
an early drop and a visible separation of the curve from the treatment group.  
•  Secondary endpoint: TTP, time to progression, evaluated during the initial assigned study 
treatment (interval between date of randomization and first documented evidence of 
progressive disease (IRR). 
In the ripretinib arm 54.1% of the patients had TTP events vs 72.7% in the placebo arm. Median TTP 
was 28.0 (20.0, 36.4) weeks for the ripretinib arm and 4.1 (4.0, 7.6) weeks for the placebo arm. 
•  Secondary endpoint: DoR, Duration of response (double blind period)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 87/134 
 
 
 
 
Eight patients in the ripretinib arm showed a PR (ITT population). DoR for these eight patients were 
analysed; one patient progressed, one underwent salvage surgery and for the rest of the responding 
patients the median DoR was not reached at DCO. 
•  Disease-related symptoms and quality of life - Patient Reported Outcome Measurements 
The PRO instruments were not used after verified progression. The stated objective was “to assess the 
improvement of disease-related symptoms”. QOL as determined by changes from baseline to Day 1 of 
Cycle 2 in EORTC-QLQ-C30 Role function and Physical function was entered into the hierarchical testing 
strategy (each at 0.025 level significance). Thus, statistical significance was dependent on the success 
of the earlier tests in the hierarchy. If Day 1 of Cycle 2 value was missing, then the change from 
baseline to the end of initial study treatment will be used in the analysis”. At cycle 2 day 1, 
approximately 80% of placebo patients had experienced progression, as opposed to around 20% in the 
active treatment arm. At Cycle 2 day 1, responses for 9/42 patients in the placebo group were missing, 
whereas the number of responses had increased from 74 at baseline to 79-80 in the active treatment 
arm.  
Results with respect to the Open label treatment period 
There were 71 patients that had disease progression and entered the open-label period, including 42 
(49.4%) patients in the ripretinib arm and 29 (67.4%) patients in the placebo arm. 
Time to crossover was defined as the time interval between the date of randomisation and the first 
date of ripretinib 150 mg dose for patients who initially received placebo and subsequently crossed 
over to ripretinib treatment. Of the 29 patients who originally received placebo in the double-blind 
period and crossed over to ripretinib 150 mg QD, the median (95% CI) estimated time to crossover 
was 6.6 (5.1, 9.1) weeks (data on file). 
Out of the 29 patients crossing over to receive 150 mg ripretinib QD, 10 patients were ongoing at 
DCO. Ten (10) patients subsequently dose escalated to 150 mg ripretinib BID, only 1 patient was still 
ongoing at DCO.  
Furthermore, there were 11 patients from the initial ripretinib 150 mg QD treatment arm who 
continued the same 150 mg QD dose in the open-label period, i.e., no dose-escalation. Only 1 patient 
was ongoing at DCO.  
There were 31 patients, that received 150 mg QD in the double-blind period and after confirmed 
progressive disease, dose escalated to 150 mg ripretinib BID in the open label period, nine (9) of these 
patients were ongoing at DCO.

PFS (IRR) for Patients who Originally Received Placebo and crossed over to the Open-label 
Period (ITT Population) 
  ,. 
At DCO, close to 34% of the 71 patients entering the open label treatment period had been on 
treatment between 3 and 6 months and 18% had been on treatment between 6 and 12 months. The 
primary reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease.  
Dose escalation  
During the double-blind period of the INVICTUS study, patients in the ripretinib arm at the time of IRR 
progressive disease were offered the option to dose escalate to ripretinib 150 mg BID. Therefore, from 
the main study but also from the supportive study, data were generated on the doubling of the dose at 
the time of progression. 
Assessment report

The problem with these data is that there is no randomised control group to which outcomes can be 
compared and therefore, this does not isolate a drug effect. Furthermore, there are no objective 
responses to isolate drug effects (see discussion on clinical efficacy and B/R).

Updated efficacy analyses 
The most recent data cut-off, 10 Aug 2020 (another 14 months of FU) shows that of the 129 patients 
originally enroled, 6 patients randomised to ripretinib are still receiving ripretinib and 16 patients are 
receiving ripretinib as part of the open-label period.

Overall, PFS results from the 10 Aug 2020 data cut-off were similar in the ITT and PP populations. 
Compared to the previous data cut-off, the median Kaplan-Meier estimate was the same, and 
additional data were reported for 78 and 104 weeks. ORR was adjusted from 9.4% to 11.8% and 
median OS from 65,6weeks to 79.1 weeks (descriptive). These data are presented in the SmPC. 
Analysis performed across trials  
The randomised study, INVICTUS (DCC 2618-03-001), included GIST patients having already received 
at least the three lines of TKIs approved in this indication, studied ripretinib+ BSC vs BSC, with the 
primary endpoint of PFS. The dose-response study, DCC-2618-01-001, included a variety of tumours 
with evidence of alterations in genes that are targets of ripretinib, with the primary ambition to define 
the RP2D and using this dose to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral ripretinib and determine the 
anti-tumour activity of ripretinib in all diseases studied. However, among other subgroups, a subgroup 
with GIST patients, receiving ripretinib in ≥4 line, was identified.  
A comparison of baseline characteristics showed that there were no major differences with respect to 
gender, age, race, ethnicity or ECOG at screening. For tumour assessment, study DCC-2618 01-001 
used RECIST by INV, while study INVICTUS (DCC 2618-03-001) as primary endpoint assessed tumour 
response according to mRECIST (v 1.1) by IRR. Furthermore, the exposure in Study DCC-2618-01-001 
includes also exposure to ripretinib 150 mg BID for patients who experienced progressive disease, 
while the data presented for INVICTUS includes patients from the double-blind period separated from 
the open-label period. Therefore, the exposure between the two studies is not comparable. 
Tables provided for this side-by side-comparison are misleading with regards to the prior lines of 
treatment received in the different study cohorts/treatment arms, and do not properly reflect relevant 
existing differences between studies. 
A comparison between these two studies is, of many reasons, not statistically feasible, but the results 
from the dose-escalation study are not, however, challenging the results from the main study.

Clinical studies in special populations  
-GIST is very rare in children and adolescents.  
A full waiver has been granted on the basis of lack of significant benefit in the paediatric population by 
the PDCO. 
-Patients with renal or hepatic impairment  
No clinically meaningful effects on the PK of ripretinib were identified for mild to moderate renal 
impairment (baseline creatinine clearance 30 to <90 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment (National 
Cancer Institute hepatic impairment categories B1 and B2). Since there were only 2 patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment and 4 patients with severe renal impairment, the data were insufficient 
for an assessment of the impact of moderate and severe hepatic impairment and severe renal 
impairment on ripretinib PK. No information is presented concerning efficacy and/or safety in these 
special populations. The applicant should provide any available information from ongoing studies and 
justify current SmPC recommendations.  
-Elderly patients 
No clinically meaningful effects on the PK of ripretinib were identified for age (19 to 87 years). Based 
on subgroup analyses provided, efficacy can be concluded across all age groups.  
The table below has been completed by the applicant with the most updated information from 
ripretinib studies. In clinical studies, no clinically relevant differences were observed between elderly 
(aged >65 years and above) and younger patients (aged <65 and >18 years) which is included in the 
SmPC.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has applied for a full marketing approval for the pan-KIT and PDGFRA inhibitor ripretinib 
for the indication  
Qinlock is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
(GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.

- The pivotal study, DCC 2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) is an ongoing Phase 3, 2-arm, randomised (2:1), 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study comparing the efficacy of ripretinib + best 
supportive care (“ripretinib arm”) with placebo + best supportive care (“placebo arm”), in 129 adult 
patients with advanced GIST  (85 vs 44 in the ripretinib and placebo arm, respectively), who had 
progressive disease on imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib or were intolerant to any of these 
treatments. Since there were no other EU approved treatment options at study initiation, the choice of 
BSC as the control arm, is justified. Patients received ripretinib 150 mg or placebo orally once daily 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Crossover was permitted at disease progression for 
patients randomised to receive placebo. Patients were stratified by prior lines of therapy (3 vs. ≥4) and 
EGOG PS (0 vs.1 or 2). Furthermore, intra-patient dose-escalation was possible after confirmed 
progression.   
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) based on assessment by 
blinded independent central radiological review (IRR) using modified RECIST v1.1, in which lymph 
nodes and bone lesions were not target lesions and a progressively growing new tumour nodule within 
a pre-existing tumour mass must meet specific criteria to be considered unequivocal evidence of 
progression. Key secondary endpoint was ORR, while OS was another secondary endpoint.  
The statistical methods are overall acceptable and match the study design. The analysis plan divides 
the study in the double-blind and open label period, which is an unusual way to describe an event 
driven study were unblinding takes place at the time of the PFS event, which is the primary endpoint. 
However, OS is analyzed regardless of period which would be expected. 
The censoring rules for PFS is noted to be according to FDA guideline. The amount of and reason for 
censoring differ slightly between the treatment groups. Treating the censoring as uninformative, as in 
the primary statistical analysis, may introduce bias and lead to incorrect conclusions about the extent 
of the treatment difference. However, the results from the primary analysis are considered robust and 
the value of further sensitivity analyses are considered of limited value. 
The procedure to control the type 1-error for multiple testing is a hierarchical testing procedure, 
testing the primary endpoint (PFS), key secondary endpoint (ORR), OS and quality of life sequentially. 
Testing is stopped when a test does not meet statistical significance at the 5%-level. The remaining 
analyses will be interpreted as descriptive and non-confirmative. 
The analysis plan, mainly changing the analysis population for primary endpoint and to include 
stratification variables in the statistical test method, was changed in amendment 5 during the study. 
These changes do not cause concern since the changes made are for analyses that are preferred by 
the CHMP and would have been requested from the applicant if not included in the MAA. 
The presented results were initially based on the primary analysis from May 2019 and an update on 
efficacy and safety data with the most recent cut-off date was provided by the applicant.  
- Study DCC-2618-01-001, an open-label, multi-centre Phase 1 study to assess safety, tolerability, 
efficacy, and PK of ripretinib in adult patients with unresectable, metastatic GIST (also including other 
advanced malignancies with evidence of alterations in genes that are targets of ripretinib) who had 
received at least 1 prior anticancer therapy. The study design consists of two parts: a dose escalation 
part (Part 1, completed), and a dose expansion part (Part 2, ongoing). During Part 1, escalating doses 
were evaluated for safety and tolerability and determination of RP2D. Determination of PK profile as 
well as documentation of preliminary evidence of ripretinib antitumour activity in patients with 
advanced malignancies was also planned. During Part 2, additional patients were to, be included into 
10 different cohorts (n=237), of which 3 included GIST patients, all receiving the selected PR2D of 
ripretinib.  
In all 142 GIST patients were treated with ripretinib 150 mg QD during the phase 1 study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 95/134 
 
 
 
Tumour assessment was performed using RECIST criteria (v1.1) and emphasis was borne down on 
results for all 142 GIST patients at the RP2D and including those 83 GIST patients who received the 
RP2D as the ≥4th line of treatment. The primary objective was to further evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of ripretinib and to determine the antitumour activity. Other objectives were to determine 
the PK profile, safety and tolerability of RP2D in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results for the Pivotal study, DCC 2618-03-001 (INVICTUS)  
Patient characteristics of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population in INVICTUS were median age of 60 years 
(range: 29 to 83 years), with 39% aged ≥65 years; 57% were male; 75% were white; and 92% had 
an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Sixty-three percent (63%) of patients received 3 prior 
therapies and 37% received 4 or more prior therapies. Sixty-six percent (66%) of patients randomized 
to placebo switched to ripretinib after disease progression. 
Inclusion allowed patients with ECOG PS ≥ 2, however, only 8.5% of the included patient had ECOG PS 
2, 63 % had received 3 prior lines of therapy (37% ≥4 prior lines) and a large proportion of elderly 
(24.8% of the patients in the age range of 65 to 74 years and 18 (14.0%) patients were ≥ 75 years of 
age.  
The study showed a high treatment compliance. 
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients in the ripretinib arm 
compared with those in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09, 
0.25; p < 0.0001). The median PFS was 27,6 weeks (95% CI 20.0, 29,9) for ripretinib compared with 
4.1 weeks (95% CI 4.0, 7.3) for placebo. 
The ORR was 9% (95% CI 4.2, 18) in the ripretinib arm compared with 0% (95% CI 0, 8) in the 
placebo arm (nominal p-value = 0.0504 by Fisher's exact test). Consequently, ORR failed to show a 
statistical significance on the 5% level.  
The median OS in the ripretinib arm was 65.6 weeks (i.e., 15.1 months) (95% CI 53.6, 65.6) 
compared with 28.6 weeks (95% CI 17.9, 50.4) in the placebo arm with a HR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.21, 
0.62), though OS was not evaluated for statistical significance as a result of the pre-specified 
hierarchical multiple testing plan for secondary endpoints (i.e., PFS, then ORR, then OS). The clinical 
relevance of the OS results is, however, undisputable.  
The PFS data was further supported by other secondary endpoints like TTP. 
Furthermore, the clinical significance of ripretinib treatment was also demonstrated by patients after 
confirmed progressive disease, crossed over from the placebo arm to the open label treatment of 
ripretinib, who gained a further 20.0 (8.0, NE) weeks with stable disease. 
Updated efficacy data with DCO 10 Aug 2020, demonstrated continued efficacy with ripretinib for 
patients with advanced GIST with regard to key efficacy results for the double-blind period (ITT and PP 
populations) and crossover patients in the open-label period.   
Supportive evidence of efficacy 
Phase 1, Study DCC-2618-01-001  
Results from Part 1, dose escalation: 
1) 3 DLTs were reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 96/134 
 
 
 
2) MTD was not reached 
3) RP2D selected was 150 mg QD.  
Efficacy results from Part 2, (interim data, as of 01 Mar 2019), included patients with advanced GIST 
who had received ripretinib 150 mg QD as either 2nd line (N=31), 3rd line (N=28) or ≥4th line 
(N=83), in all 142 patients.  
ORR displayed no CRs but PR rates reported for all patients were 11.3%, and for those who received 
ripretinib as their 4th line therapy 10.9% and for those who received ripretinib as the ≥4th line therapy 
7.2%.   
Kaplan-Meier estimate of median (50th percentile) PFS (by INV) was 23.9 weeks (95% CI 15.9, 24.3) 
for patients who received treatment as the ≥4th line of therapy  
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median duration of response was 76.1 weeks in 6 responders who 
received 150 mg QD as the ≥4th line of therapy in the Escalation and Expansion Phases,  
Results in the cohort of patients who received ripretinib as a ≥ 4th line therapy appear consistent to 
those seen in the phase 3 trial, which is considered relevant supportive evidence.  
Long-term studies with ripretinib have not been conducted. Both Study DCC-2618-01-001 and Study 
DCC-2618-03-001 continue to evaluate ongoing patients as defined by the protocols.  
The available data do not permit an analysis of the effect of drug over time after treatment is stopped 
or withheld. 
Claim for dose escalation after progression 
The problem with the dose escalation data is that there is no randomised control group to which 
outcomes can be compared and therefore, this does not isolate a drug effect. Furthermore, there are 
no objective responses to isolate drug effects.  
Consequently, the demonstration of clinical utility depends on an intra-patient comparison of PFS2 and 
PFS1, where time from PFS1 to PFS2 is shorter than is PFS1. Therefore, the intra-patient comparison 
of PFS is subject to uncertainty. In conclusion, it may be that the dose increase option after 
progression provides clinical benefit. However, data are not robust enough to support a claim for this 
treatment strategy in the SmPC 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The clinical relevance of efficacy shown, in patients with advanced GIST having received three prior 
lines of TKI treatments, is unambiguous. Notwithstanding the failure to show ORR significance on the 
5% level, the results of OS and other secondary endpoints like TTP are reassuring. In addition, patients 
crossing over from placebo to open label ripretinib, also gained a substantial PFS benefit.  
The Phase 1 study (Study DCC
2618
01
001) provide data in support for a meaningful benefit by 
ripretinib to GIST patients.

31 May 2019 (date that the study was unblinded), and 01 Mar 2019, respectively. An additional 90-day

safety update at the request of FDA following the NDA submission with cut-off of 31 Aug 2019, has 
also been provided.  
The integrated safety analysis includes three main components: 
• 
Pool 1 - DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS): Includes the subsets of patients receiving 150 mg 
QD, patients who were dose escalated to 150 mg BID and patients who originally received placebo and 
subsequently crossed over to ripretinib; N=114 
• 
Pool 2 - The 150 mg QD subset and the safety data collected from both studies, also including 
patients who were dose escalated to 150 mg BID; N=256  
• 
Pool 3 - All patients from both studies in the safety population and the safety data collected 
on/after ripretinib treatment; N=372 
2.5.4.1.  Patient exposure 
Summary of Exposure to Ripretinib in Clinical Studies Included in the SCS 
Safety data from a total of 446 patients with any exposure to ripretinib is included in the submission. 
Of these, 351 patients had advanced malignancies (including 256 patients with GIST [treated at the 
recommended dose] from study DCC-2618-01-001 and study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) and 95 
were healthy subjects. The 114 GIST patients in the pivotal DCC-2618-03-001 study receiving 
ripretinib, comprises the 85 patients randomised to ripretinib up-front and the 29 patients in the 
placebo group that opted to switch to ripretinib in the open-label phase. 
The size of the safety data base that is relevant to the applied indication i.e. treatment in GIST 
patients and who were exposed to the recommended dose [N=256], is considered sufficiently 
comprehensive to characterize the safety profile of ripretinib at least in the short term perspective 
given the rarity of the disease and the later line indication applied for.

DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) 
Double-blind treatment period (ripretinib N=85; placebo N=43): The mean (SD) treatment 
duration for ripretinib was 24.44 (13.941) weeks as compared to the placebo arm (8.25 [6.757] 
weeks). Median treatment duration was similar with 23.86 weeks (range 1.3 to 59.4 weeks) and 6.00 
weeks (range 0.4 to 38.4 weeks) for the ripretinib and placebo arms respectively.  
A total of 45.9% received ripretinib for ≥ 6 months, 18.8% ≥ 9 months and 3.5% beyond 12 months.  
Overall, 24.7% had any dose modification in the ripretinib arm and 20.9% in the placebo arm. In the 
ripretinib arm, 8.2% had any dose reduction, 21.2% had any dose interruption, and 3.5% had any 
dose increase. In the placebo arm, 2.3% had any dose reduction, 18.6% had any dose interruption 
with none having any dose increase.  
It is noted that per protocol, dose escalation to 150 mg BID did not equal a dose increase. Dose 
increases occurred when returning to the prior dose after a dose reduction.  
Mean (SD) relative dose intensity was 96.5 (7.62) in the ripretinib arm and 91.6 (11.96) in the placebo 
arm with a median of 100.0 (range 64 to 100) and 97.0 (range 56 to 100). 
Open label treatment period: For the 29 patients who received placebo in the double-blind period 
and crossed over to receive ripretinib 150 mg QD in the open-label phase, the mean (SD) treatment 
was 16.87 (12.418) weeks with a median treatment duration of 12.00 weeks (range 1.0 to 44.1 
weeks). A total of 24.1% had a treatment duration ≥ 6 months, 6.9 % ≥ 9 months and none beyond 
12 months. Two patients (6.9 %) had any dose reduction whilst 31.0 % had any dose interruption. 
Mean (SD) relative dose intensity for these 29 patients was 92.5 (12.56) with a median of 100.0 
(range 50 to 100).  
For the 11 patients who received ripretinib 150 mg QD in the double-blind period and continued to 
receive 150 mg QD in the open-label period, the mean (SD) treatment was 5.23 (6.169) weeks and 
the median treatment duration was 3.86 (range 0.3 to 20.0) weeks. One patient (9.1%) had a 
treatment duration ≥ 3 months but none had a treatment duration that lasted beyond 6 months. These 
findings are not unexpected as patients continued into the open-label treatment period upon confirmed 
disease progression, remaining on the same dose that had already failed to sustain a tumour response 
in the double-blinded treatment period.      
Of the 41 patients who dose escalated and received ripretinib 150 mg BID in the open-label period, the 
mean (SD) treatment was 14.79 (11.657) weeks and the median treatment duration 15.14 (range 0.1 
to 43.1 weeks). Six (14.6%) patients had a treatment duration of ≥ 6 months but none beyond 12 
months. Five (12.2%) patients had any dose reduction, and 11 (26.8%) patients had any dose 
interruption. Mean (SD) relative dose intensity for these 41 patients was 95.3 (9.92) with a median 
treatment duration of 100.0 (range 56 to 100). It is noted that the applicant does not propose any 
dose increases in the label. 
The overall high relative dose intensity for ripretinib and the low number of patients requiring a dose 
reduction are considered indicative of a favourable tolerability. The proportion of dose interruptions 
does not raise any major concern. 
Analysis Pools (Integrated Analysis) 
The median time on treatment for patients in the pivotal study (Pool 1; N=114) and in the overall GIST 
subset treated at the recommended dose in Pool 2 (N=256) was 29.57 (range 1.0, 65.1) and 31.57 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 99/134 
 
 
 
(range 0.4, 116.4), respectively. The corresponding means were 28.34 (14.934) and 35.92 (23.554), 
respectively. 
The relative dose intensity in Pool 1 was median 100.00 % (range 64.3 to 100.0) with mean 95.03 
(8.370) and 98.48 % (range 36.7 to 100.0) with mean 93.15 (11.591) for the GIST subset in Pool 2.  
The fairly high rate of dose modifications is noted with 39.5 % in Pool 1 and 55.5 % in the GIST subset 
in Pool 2, the vast majority however, being interruptions (34.2 % and 39.8 % in the respective 
groups). Very few had a dose increase in Pool 1 (2.6 %) but 24.6 % in the GIST subset in Pool 2. At 
least one dose reduction was experienced by 12.3% and 14.5%, respectively.   
For the GIST patients who received ripretinib 150 mg QD as ≥ 4th line of therapy (N=197), the mean 
(SD) duration of ripretinib treatment administration was 24.54 (18.258) weeks and a median of 21.86 
(range 0.4 to 91.4) weeks. A total of 39.6% received ripretinib for ≥ 6 months, and 7.6% received 
treatment ≥ 12months.  
The median (range) relative dose intensity administered was 100.0 % (46.7 to 103.0). A dose 
modification of any type was experienced by 44.2%, 9.1% had a dose reduction, and 25.9% 
experienced a dose interruption at any time. 
At the updated cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019, the median time on treatment had increased to about 9 
months, similar in both Pool 1 and the GIST subset in Pool 2. The corresponding means were 33.24 
(SD 19.147) and 42.93 (SD 31.386) weeks, respectively. Overall, 60.5% had a treatment duration ≥ 6 
months, 43.0% ≥ 9 months, 18.4% ≥ 12 months but none beyond 2 years in Pool 1. In the GIST 
subset in Pool 2, the corresponding proportions were 61.7 %, 48.4%, 32.4% with 11 patients (4.3%) 
treated beyond 2 years. Data on relative dose intensity and dose modifications are overall in line with 
the observations at the previous respective data cut-off dates. 
2.5.4.2.  Adverse events 
Methodology for determination of ADRs 
For the ADR analysis, the double-blind period in Study DCC-2618-03-001 formed the primary basis of 
the determination of ADRs i.e. the TEAEs that were at least 5% higher in ripretinib arm as compared to 
the placebo arm and those that were at least 1.5 times greater in the ripretinib arm than those 
compared to placebo arm were considered ADRs. These include very common (10% and above) events 
of alopecia, fatigue, nausea, myalgia, constipation, diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, vomiting, weight decreased, muscle spasms, lipase increased, headache, dyspnoea, 
arthralgia, hypertension, dry skin, blood bilirubin increased, oedema peripheral, hypophosphataemia, 
and common (≥ 1% to <10%) events of pruritus, stomatitis, rash maculo-papular, hyperkeratosis, 
depression and dermatitis acneiform.  
The ADRs were also evaluated across the pooled TEAE (all causality) safety population data (N=372, 
cut-off date: 31 Aug 2019).  Risks were also reviewed to identify any potential ADRs and the risk of 
squamous cell carcinoma of skin (CMQ) was included.  
The methodology for determination of ADRs is considered overall acceptable.

experienced a Grade 3/4 TEAE, 30.6% patients had a treatment-emergent SAE but only 7 patients 
(8.2%) had a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. A total of 7.1% experienced a TEAE leading 
to dose reduction, 23.5% a TEAE leading to dose interruption, and 5.9% a TEAE leading to death.  In 
the placebo arm, 44.2% experienced a Grade 3/4 TEAE, 44.2% had a treatment-emergent SAE, 11.6% 
a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation, 2.3% a TEAE leading to dose reduction, 20.9% a TEAE 
leading to dose interruption, and 23.3% a TEAE leading to death.  
For the 41 patients who dose escalated and received ripretinib 150mg BID in the open-label period, 
TEAEs were reported in 95.1%, any Grade 3/4 TEAEs in 58.5%, and any TEAEs leading to dose 
interruption in 36.6%. TEAE leading to death were reported in 17.1%.  
Overall, observations for the patients that continued on ripretinib 150 QD (N=11) and the group of 
patients that opted to cross over from placebo to ripretinib in the open label period (N=29) is in line 
with findings reported during the double-blinded treatment phase however any firm conclusion is 
hampered by the limited number of patients.

Analysis Pools (Integrated Analysis) 
Summary of TEAEs for the Analysis Pools (Integrated Analysis - Safety Population) 
Almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE.  The proportions of any Grade 3/4 were similar in 
Pool 1 and the GIST subset in Pool 2 (about 63%). In terms of any treatment-emergent SAE similarity 
in reporting rates are also observed (45.6% and 48.0% respectively). Any TEAE leading to treatment 
discontinuation were reported in 13.2% and 11.7% respectively. Any TEAE leading to dose reduction 
were 7.9% and 12.9% respectively and TEAE leading to dose interruption 37.7% and 44.1%, 
respectively. Any TEAE leading to death were reported in 18.4% and 14.5% respectively.

The safety profile in regard to any TEAE, severity, SAEs and dose modifications reported in the GIST 
patients receiving 150 mg QD and who previously had received ≥ 4th lines of therapies are in line with 
that reported for the overall GIST subset. 
Overall, data from the GIST subset (N=256) supports the findings as reported in the pivotal study.

Page 107/134 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs reported in ≥ 25% of patients in Pool 1 were alopecia (53.5%), fatigue (43.9%), nausea 
(38.6%), myalgia (36.0%), constipation (36.8%), decreased appetite (33.3%), abdominal pain 
(42.1%), and diarrhoea (28.9%). PPES was reported in 22.8%.  
The distribution and rates of TEAEs for the GIST subset are comparable. In the GIST subset in Pool 2 , 
the corresponding TEAEs  ≥ 25% were alopecia (57.0%), fatigue (49.2%), nausea (41.8%), myalgia 
(42.2%), constipation (38.3%), decreased appetite (32.8%), abdominal pain (32.0%), diarrhoea 
(28.9%) and PPES 33.6%. 
The overall safety profile in GIST patients previously having received ≥ 4th lines of therapies are in line 
with the safety profile reported for the overall GIST subset. 
There was one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome reported in the GIST subset in Pool 2 (Table 9.1.1). 
Upon further review however, a causal association between SJS and ripretinib cannot be established 
based on this case.  
Lipase increased was reported in 8.8%, 18.4% and 21.7% in Pool 1, the GIST subset in Pool 2 and 
Pool 3, respectively. Furthermore, Grade 3/4 lipase increased was reported in 13.4 % in Pool 3. The 
clinical relevance of events of lipase increased remains unclear. The high reporting rate appears not to 
translate into an increased risk of pancreatitis.  
In regard to phototoxicity, pre-clinical studies indicated that ripretinib has potential for photo-
irritation/phototoxicity (information included in section 5.3 of the SmPC). In the Risk Analysis 
Population, 2 patients (1.0%, 2 of 197) experienced a photosensitivity reaction. No photosensitivity 
TEAEs were reported in patients treated with ripretinib in the double-blind period of the DCC-2618-03-
001 study. It is however noted that as a pre-cautionary measure in this study, patients were instructed 
to avoid strong sunlight, sunlamps, and other sources of ultraviolet radiation for the duration of the 
Assessment report

study in order to mitigate the potential risk of photo-irritation/phototoxicity. Moreover, prophylactic 
skin care was recommended which included sunscreen with SPF ≥ 30, hypoallergenic moisturizing 
creams or ointments for dry skin, and gentle skincare with fragrance-free soaps and detergents.  
The applicant is asked to include a warning in section 4.4 about this risk and propose actionable 
measures to mitigate this event occurring in line with other TKIs in the same class. In addition, a 
causal association with ripretinib treatment should be further investigated and the applicant is asked to 
add `Phototoxicity´ as an important potential risk to the RMP and discuss how this risk should be 
further characterised.  
TEAEs by severity 
Most Common (>5%) Grade 3/4 TEAEs by PT and Analysis Pool (Integrated Analysis -Safety 
Population) 
In Pool 3, 63.2% reported at least one Grade 3 or 4 TEAE. Grade 3/4 TEAEs occurring in >5% of 
patients were lipase increased (13.4%), anaemia (10.5%), hypertension (6.6%), and abdominal pain 
(6.0%).  
The overall safety profile regarding severity in GIST patients previously having received ≥ 4th lines of 
therapies, are in line with what have been reported for the overall GIST subset (Table not shown). 
Grade 3/4 TEAEs reported by >5% of patients included anaemia (8.6%), lipase increased (6.6%), and 
abdominal pain (5.1%). 
Adverse events leading to dose modification 
Dose reductions 
At the cut-off date 31 May 2019, the frequency of dose reductions due to AEs was 12.0% in Pool 3 
(N=351). The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to dose reduction were PPES (2.0%); lipase 
increased (1.4%); fatigue and non-cardiac chest pain (0.9% in each); and abdominal pain, nausea, 
pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinaemia, myalgia, memory impairment, and blood bilirubin increased (0.6%

each). All other TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported by a maximum of one patient in all 
analysis pools (Table not shown). 
The corresponding proportions for the GIST subset in Pool 2 (N=256), were PPES 2.7%; lipase 
increased 0.8%; fatigue 1.2%, non-cardiac chest pain 0.4%; and abdominal pain, pancreatitis, blood 
bilirubin increased and hyperbilirubinaemia 0.8% each, nausea and myalgia 0.4% each.   
At the cut-off date 31 August 2019, the frequency of dose reductions due to AEs was 13.2% for Pool 3 
(N=372) and 14.5% for the GIST subset in Pool 2 (N=256) with the distribution of TEAEs leading to 
dose reductions similar to that of the previous cut-off date.  
Dose interruptions 
A total of 43.6% of patients in Pool 3 reported at least one TEAE leading to dose interruption of 
ripretinib. The most commonly reported (occurring in >3% of total patients) included lipase increased 
(4.0%), abdominal pain and nausea (3.1% each), blood bilirubin increased (2.8%) and PPES (2.6%). 
Table included in the clinical AR. 
AEs of clinical importance (AECIs)/AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
Specific AEs were chosen based on their clinical importance, selected target-mediated effects, 
frequency in ripretinib clinical studies, experience with other TKIs, nonclinical findings, and after review 
of the safety findings from individual clinical studies. Categories of AECI included cardiac disorders, 
diarrhoea, myalgia and arthralgia, dermatological toxicity, and laboratory abnormalities. AESIs were 
defined per protocol, and included hyperbilirubinemia, blood bilirubin increased, squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin (SCC), keratoacanthoma, and actinic keratosis in DCC-2618-01-001, and SCC, 
keratoacanthoma, and actinic keratosis in INVICTUS. The analysis of AECI encompasses the protocol 
defined AESIs.

AECIs reported in ≥ 25% of patients in Pool 3 were alopecia (49.6%), myalgia (36.2%), PPES 
(28.8%), and diarrhoea (26.8%). Twenty-eight (8.0%) patients experienced an event from the SMQ of 
SCC of skin; no patient had a TEAE of SCC of skin or SCC of head and neck that led to dose reduction 
or dose discontinuation.   
Hypertension was reported in almost 20% of the safety population with Grade 3/4 reported in 6%. The 
proposed SmPC currently contains information on recommended dose modifications in 4.2, 
recommendations in 4.4 that ripretinib should not be initiated unless blood pressure is adequately 
controlled and in section 4.8. This is at this point considered adequate. 
Alopecia is frequently reported with ripretinib treatment. A total of 55.0% of patients with GIST had at 
least one event of alopecia which led to dose reduction in one (0.3%) patient, and in dose interruption 
in one (0.3%) patient. None discontinued the study due to alopecia. `Alopecia´ is adequately reflected 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) was reported in about 30% of patients. The 
SmPC currently contains information in sections 4.2 (recommendations on dose modifications 
according to severity), 4.4 and 4.8. This is considered adequate.  
Cases of SCC of the skin occurred during ripretinib treatment. Three (0.9%) patients experienced an 
event from the SMQ of melanoma.  Two (0.6%) patients had a TEAE of malignant melanoma in situ; 
neither of these events led to dose interruption, dose reduction, or dose discontinuation.  
The SmPC currently contains information in section 4.4 stating that routine dermatologic examinations 
are recommended for patients taking ripretinib, and section 4.8. This is considered satisfactory.

Myalgia and arthralgia were other events considered expected with ripretinib treatment, reported in 
36.2% and 18.2% of patients, respectively. In the proposed SmPC, myalgia and arthralgia are included 
in 4.2 (recommended dose modifications) and 4.8. This is at this point considered acceptable. 
Diarrhoea was adjudicated as an AECI and reported in about 30% of the patients. It is recognised that 
although very commonly reported, the vast majority of events of diarrhoea was of Grade 1/2 and the 
majority of patients did not receive any treatment for diarrhoea. Furthermore, dose modifications were 
rarely required, and study drug was not withdrawn in any case.  
The most frequently reported serious AECIs in Pool 3 were cardiac dysfunction (1.3%) whereof cardiac 
failure 0.8%; blood bilirubin increased (1.1%) and diarrhoea (0.5%). All other serious AECIs were 
reported in a single patient. The observations in Pool 3 are in line with the observations in the GIST 
subset (N=298).

Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events ≥ 2 Patients by Preferred Term in Double-blind Period 
(Safety Population) 
In the ripretinib arm, 30.6% patients experienced any treatment-emergent SAE during the double-
blind treatment phase. The most commonly reported in ≥ 2 patients were abdominal pain (4.7%), 
anaemia and death (3.5% each), nausea and vomiting (2.4% each).  In the placebo arm, 44.2% 
patients experienced any treatment-emergent SAE with the most commonly reported being death

(9.3%), and abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and asthenia (4.7% each).  It is noted that if 
the cause of death was unknown, Death NOS was to be entered as the description for the AE. 
Deaths 
Of the 25 patients who died during the double-blind and long-term follow-up periods, 22 died due to 
progression (11 patients in each arm). Five (5.9%) patients in the ripretinib arm and 10 (23.3%) 
patients in the placebo arm had TEAEs leading to death during study treatment or within 30 days of 
the last dose. In the ripretinib arm these were listed (MedDRA PTs) as hypoglycaemia, general physical 
health deterioration, and death (3 patients). In the placebo group TEAEs leading to death were acute 
kidney injury (2 patients), death (4 patients), septic shock and pulmonary oedema, asthenia, 
gastrointestinal perforation, and abdominal pain each in 1 patient.  
All deaths that occurred during the open label and subsequent follow-up periods until 31 May 2019 in 
both treatment arms were due to disease progression except for one patient whose cause of death was 
unknown.

Deaths in Study DCC-2618-01-001 
At the 01 Mar 2019 cutoff, 35 patients had died (10 patients in the escalation Phase [whereof 8 GIST 
patients] and 25 patients during the Expansion Phase [whereof 19 patients with GIST]). The vast 
majority of the patients died of disease progression.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the GIST-population (N=298), the majority of patients did not experience any change from baseline 
(54 %, 80.9 %, 85.9 % and 85.9 % for Haemoglobin Decreased, Neutrophil Count Decreased, Platelet 
Count Decreased or White Blood Cell Decreased, respectively).   
A total of 13.1 % experienced a worsening in neutrophil count decreased post-baseline. A Grade 3/4 
worsening was observed in 1.7 %, and improvement from baseline in 4.0 %. Post-baseline worsening 
of platelet count decreased was observed in 11.1 %. No patient had worsening to Grade3/4 and 
improvement from baseline was seen in 1.0 %. A total of 31.9 % experienced a post-baseline 
worsening of haemoglobin decreased and 12.1 % had an improvement from baseline. A Grade 3/4 
worsening was observed in 8.7 %. 
Based on laboratory observations in regard to haematological parameters, ripretinib appears not to 
have any major bone marrow suppressive properties. 
Liver Chemistry Parameters 
In the GIST-population (N=298), no worsening or change from baseline was observed in the majority 
of patients. The respective proportions of patients without any change (increase) from baseline for ALP 
was 74.5%, ALT 82.9%, AST 72.5%, blood bilirubin 71.8% or serum amylase 75.5%. 
A post-baseline worsening of ALT increase was observed in 11.7%; Grade 1 or 2 in 11.1%) and Grade 
3/4, 0.7%. Improvement from baseline in alanine aminotransferase increased was seen in 3.0%.  For 
AST increased, 21.1% experienced any worsening post-baseline of which 0.7% experienced a Grade 
3/4. A total of 4.0% experienced an improvement from baseline.  For blood bilirubin increased, any 
worsening was seen in 25.2%, with 1.7 % worsening to Grade 3 but no Grade 4. A total of 0.6% had 
an improvement from baseline.   
A total of 20.8% experienced any worsening in serum amylase increased with the majority (19.5%) 
experiencing worsening to Grade 1 or 2. 
Renal Chemistry Parameters 
In the GIST-population (N=298), no worsening or change from baseline was observed in the majority 
of patients. A total of 44.0 % experienced a post-baseline worsening of lipase increased, that was 
Grade 1 or 2 in 27.5 %. Worsening lipase increased to Grade 3 was observed in 14.4 % and worsening 
to Grade 4 in 2.0 %. In regard to Albumin Decreased, a total of 19.1 % experienced a post-baseline 
worsening, that was Grade 1 or 2 in 17.8 %. Grade 3 was observed in 1.3 % with no Grade 4 reported. 
Blood Pressure 
A total of 77.5% of patients in Pool 3 (N=351) had a systolic BP within the normal range (<140 
mmHg) at baseline, and 91.7% of patients had a diastolic BP within normal range (<90 mmHg) at 
baseline. A total of 43.9% in Pool 3 experienced no shift in post-baseline systolic BP during treatment, 
and 62.7% experienced no shift in post-baseline diastolic BP. A total of 3.4% of patients with systolic 
BP values within normal range at baseline had a post-baseline systolic BP ≥ 160mmHg, and 2.0% with 
normal diastolic BP at baseline had a post-baseline value ≥ 100mmHg.  
It is noted that TEAEs of hypertension was reported in 16.8% of the patients in Pool 3. Of these, 6.6% 
experienced a Grade 3/4 TEAE. A TEAE of blood pressure increased was observed in 0.9%. It is further 
noted that 56.1% of the patients were reported to have hypertension in the medical history at 
baseline.

Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction at Baseline and Worst Post-baseline by Disease Group (Integrated 
Analysis –Pool3 –Safety Population) 
A baseline LVEF < 50% was an exclusion criterion in the pivotal study, hence the safety of ripretinib 
has not been assessed in this group of patients. It is however noted that very few had a LVEF < 50 as 
worst post-base-line value; 9 patients (3.0%) in the GIST subset. The proposed SmPC includes a 
recommendation for dose modifications in section 4.2, a recommendation on measures to be taken in 
4.4 (stating that an assessment of LVEF should be performed prior to initiating ripretinib and during 
treatment if clinically indicated) and reflected in 4.8 (Description of selected adverse drug reactions). 
As a risk minimization measure, this is considered sufficient. 
Effect on QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes 
An AE analysis using the MedDRA SMQ “Torsade de pointes/QT Prolongation” and the preferred term 
“Seizure” by treatment and dose level was performed and based on this search, 18 cases were 
identified. The event term of these cases included syncope (5 cases); sudden death, seizure, and 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (3 cases each); and loss of consciousness, electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged, cardiac arrest, and ventricular arrhythmia (1 case each). Based on pre-clinical observations, 
ripretinib does not appear to have a negative effect in terms of QT prolongation.  
Safety in special populations 
Analyses of TEAEs and SAEs by age, gender, race, geographic region, and BMI for the analysis pools 
and by lines of therapies, has been provided. No safety concerns have been evoked based on these 
data, however a firm conclusion in regard to race and region is hampered by the small sample sizes for 
the non-white and non-US cohorts.  
Paediatric Patients 
The applicant submitted a product specific waiver request for all paediatric subsets which has been 
granted (EMA/PDCO/691681/201928, Feb 2020).

As expected, a slightly higher reporting rate is recognised with increasing age in particular in regard to 
Serious AEs, in the SOCs of cardiac, vascular disorders and Infections/Infestations. However, a firm 
conclusion on the safety profiles in regard to Age groups 75-84 and >85 is hampered by the limited 
number of patients (N=29 and N=2 respectively). Overall, the safety profiles comparing Age group < 
65 with ≥65 appears fairly similar. No concern is raised.

2.5.4.4.  Discontinuation due to AEs 
DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) 
In the ripretinib and placebo arm, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 7 
(8.2%) patients and 11.6%, respectively. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation amongst the 
ripretinib exposed patients included general physical health deterioration (2 [2.4%]), anaemia, cardiac 
failure, vomiting, death, and palmar-plantar dysaesthesia syndrome (1 [1.2%] patient each). 
Analysis Pools (Integrated analysis) 
The discontinuation rate due to AEs is comparable across all three pools and subsets, ranging from 
11.7% in the GIST subset in Pool 2 to 15.4% in the Non-GIST subset. In Pool 3, the most commonly 
reported TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were abdominal pain, cardiac failure, and fatigue 
(0.9% each); and ileus, vomiting, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, and dyspnoea (0.6% 
each). This pattern of TEAEs is in line with observations in Pool 1 and Pool 2.  
Overall similar proportions were observed in regard to treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs (by 
SOC and PT) reported in the ≥ 4th line of therapies pool. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021

From a 4th line GIST perspective (per the CSR), the discontinuation rate due to TEAEs is considered low 
and points to a favourable tolerability of ripretinib.

mainland (March 2021) and Taiwan (July 2021) and Switzerland (October 2021).  
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The integrated safety analysis include data from the pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) and 
study DCC-2618-01-001 at the initial data cut-off dates of 31 May 2019 (date that the study was 
unblinded), and 01 Mar 2019, respectively. After the NDA submission in the US, an updated 90-day 
safety analysis was performed at the request of FDA with a cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019 and is included 
in the initial submission. 
The integrated safety analysis includes three main components: 
• 
• 
• 
Pool 1 - Pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS);  
Pool 2 - The 150 mg QD subset from studies DCC-2618 01-001 and DCC-2618-03-001;  
Pool 3 - All patients from both studies. 
The safety data base initially submitted encompasses a total of 446 patients who received at least one 
dose of ripretinib. Of these, 256 patients with GIST from study DCC-2618-01-001 and study DCC-
2618-03-001, were treated at the recommended dose. The size of the safety data base in terms of 
GIST patients exposed at the recommended dose (relevant to the applied indication) is considered 
sufficiently comprehensive to characterize the safety profile in the short-term perspective given the 
rarity of the disease and the later line indication applied for.  
An updated safety analysis with an additional 14 month for the pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 (initial 
data cut-off date 31th of May 2019 has been submitted as requested (10th of August 2020 as data cut-
off). It is concluded that the safety profile for ripretinib based on this updated analysis is in main 
consistent with the safety profile as characterized based on the initial safety data. No new safety 
concern has been evoked based on the available data. This conclusion is also considered applicable for 
the requested safety up-date for the GIST cohort in Pool 2. 
Available US post-marketing data covering the 6-month period from 15 May 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 do 
not show any new alarming or worrisome signals. 
Pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) 
Double-blind treatment period (ripretinib N=85; placebo N=43): The mean (SD) treatment 
duration for ripretinib was 24.44 (13.941) weeks as compared to the placebo arm (8.25 [6.757] 
weeks). Median treatment duration was 23.86 weeks (range 1.3 to 59.4 weeks) and 6.00 weeks 
(range 0.4 to 38.4 weeks), respectively.  
A total of 45.9% received ripretinib for ≥ 6 months, 18.8% ≥ 9 months and 3.5% beyond 12 months.  
Open label treatment period: Of the 29 patients who received placebo in the double-blind period 
and opted to cross over to ripretinib 150 mg QD in the open-label period, the treatment duration was 
shorter with mean (SD) treatment of 16.87 (12.418) weeks and median treatment duration of 12.00

weeks (range 1.0 to 44.1 weeks). A total of 24.1% had a treatment duration ≥ 6 months, 6.9 % ≥ 9 
months and none beyond 12 months.  
For the 11 patients who received ripretinib 150 mg QD in the double-blind period and continued to 
receive 150 mg QD in the open-label period, one patient (9.1%) had a treatment duration ≥ 3 months 
but none beyond 6 months.    
Of the 41 patients who dose escalated and received ripretinib 150 mg BID in the open-label period, the 
mean (SD) treatment was 14.79 (11.657) weeks and the median treatment duration 15.14 (range 0.1 
to 43.1 weeks). Six (14.6%) patients had a treatment duration of ≥ 6 months but none beyond 12 
months.  
There is overall, a high relative dose intensity for ripretinib indicating a favourable tolerability.  
TEAEs: During the double-blind treatment period, TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in the 
ripretinib arm included alopecia (51.8%), fatigue (42.4%), nausea (38.8%), abdominal pain (36.5%), 
constipation (34.1%), myalgia (31.85%), diarrhoea (28.2%), decreased appetite (27.1%), palmar-
plantar dysaesthesia syndrome (21.2%), and vomiting (21.2%).  Corresponding proportions of TEAEs 
in the placebo arm were abdominal pain (30.2%), fatigue (23.3%), and decreased appetite (20.9%). 
By severity: A total of 49.4% were reported to have any Grade 3/4 event in the ripretinib arm. The 
most commonly reported and experienced in ≥ 5% patients were anaemia (9.4%), and abdominal pain 
and hypertension (7.1%) patients each). In the placebo arm, 44.2% patients experienced any Grade 
3/4 event. The most commonly reported was anaemia (14.0%). 
SAEs: 30.6% patients in the ripretinib arm experienced any treatment-emergent SAE during the 
double-blind period. The most commonly reported in ≥ 2 patients in the ripretinib arm were abdominal 
pain (4.7%), anaemia (3.5%]), death (3.5%), nausea (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%).  In the placebo 
arm, 44.2% patients experienced any treatment-emergent SAE with the most commonly reported 
being death (9.3%), and abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and asthenia (4.7% each). 
Deaths: Of the 25 patients who died during the double-blind and long-term follow-up periods, 22 died 
due to progression (11 patients in each arm). Five (5.9%) patients in the ripretinib arm and 10 
(23.3%) patients in the placebo arm had TEAEs leading to death during study treatment or within 30 
days of the last dose. In the ripretinib arm these were listed (MedDRA PTs) as hypoglycaemia, general 
physical health deterioration, and death (3 patients). In the placebo group TEAEs leading to death 
were acute kidney injury (2 patients), death (4 patients), septic shock and pulmonary oedema, 
asthenia, gastrointestinal perforation, and abdominal pain each in 1 patient.  
All deaths that occurred during the open label and subsequent follow-up periods until 31 May 2019 in 
both treatment arms were due to disease progression except for one patient whose cause of death was 
unknown. 
Analysis Pools (Integrated Analysis) 
Overall, observations in terms of relative dose intensity, mean/median time on treatment, pattern of 
TEAEs, by severity, SAEs and treatment discontinuations due to AEs in Pool 2 (GIST subset) and Pool 3 
are consistent with the observations in the pivotal DCC-2618-03-001 study. At the updated cut-off 
date of 31 Aug 2019 (FDA requirement), the median time on treatment had increased to about 9 
months, similar in both Pool 1 and the GIST subset in Pool 2. The corresponding means were 33.24 
(SD 19.147) and 42.93 (SD 31.386) weeks, respectively. Overall, 60.5% had a treatment duration ≥ 6 
months, 43.0% ≥ 9 months, 18.4% ≥ 12 months but none beyond 24 months in Pool 1. In the overall 
GIST subset treated at the recommended dose in Pool 2, the corresponding proportions were 61.7 %, 
48.4%, 32.4% and 4.3 % treated beyond 24 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 121/134 
 
 
 
Discontinuations due to AEs: TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in Pool 3 (N=351) were 
reported in 13.1 % with the most commonly reported TEAEs being abdominal pain, cardiac failure, and 
fatigue (0.9% each); and ileus, vomiting, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, and dyspnoea 
(0.6% each). At the data cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019 (as per FDA request), the corresponding 
proportion of any event leading to treatment discontinuation was 15.6% in Pool 3 (N=372), 13.7% in 
the GIST subset in Pool 2 (N=256) and 13.2% in Pool 1 (N=114; 85 patients during the double-blind 
treatment period+29 patients in the placebo arm that opted to cross over to  ripretinib in the open 
label treatment period). 
From an 4th line GIST perspective (per the CSR), the discontinuation rate due to TEAEs is considered 
low and points to a favourable tolerability of ripretinib. 
Any event leading to drug reduction at the data cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019 amounted to 13.2% in 
Pool 3, 14.5% in the GIST subset in Pool 2 and 9.6% in Pool 1. The corresponding proportions for drug 
interruptions were 46.8%, 48.4% and 41.2%, respectively. 
In regard to patients with liver/renal impairment the safety profile appears to be consistent with that 
of the overall study population and no new safety concern has been identified. A phase 1 study (DCC-
2618-01-004) is planned to assess ripretinib in patients with hepatic impairment, whilst the safety and 
tolerability of ripretinib is being evaluated in a cohort of patients with renal impairment in the ongoing 
study 2618-01-001. At this point there is no evidence supporting a causal association between 
ripretinib and acute kidney injury. The current proposals regarding these special populations in the 
product information are considered adequate. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The distribution and proportions of TEAEs including by severity and SAEs is very similar between 
presented safety data pools. This is also the case when comparing with patients that had received ≥ 4 
lines of therapy prior to ripretinib treatment as well as in comparison with the updated safety data 
requested by the FDA (adding yet another 3 months of follow up and an additional 21 patients). 
Furthermore, the safety profile of ripretinib as initially characterised has been confirmed by the 
updated safety analysis with data cut-off 10th of August 2020. No new safety concern has been evoked 
based on this safety update. 
In conclusion, it is recognised that there are overall high report rates of TEAEs, Grade 3/4 events and 
SAEs. Reassuringly however, is the low rate of treatment discontinuations due to AEs and the low rate 
of patients that needed a dose reduction due to AEs. Taken together, this points to a favourable safety 
profile with manageable toxicity.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
Assessment report

cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 15.05.2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of ripretinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ripretinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Qinlock (ripretinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following indication is being sought:  
Qinlock is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
(GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
The recommended dose of ripretinib is 150 mg (3 tablets of 50 mg) taken orally QD. 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours, GISTs, are rare sarcoma, however, the most common malignant 
subepithelial lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal and 
occurs throughout the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in older patients. GIST tumours are, when 
metastasized, mostly to the peritoneum and the liver, regarded as incurable. Mutational analysis has a 
predictive value for sensitivity to molecular-targeted therapy and also a prognostic value. Despite 
progress, with respect to targeted therapies, during the last decades, secondary mutations in KIT and 
PDGFRA (gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogene proteins) genes, remains a challenge.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Surgical resection is the first choice for resectable GISTs without metastasis; and administration of 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib (Glivec) is the primary approach for unresectable, 
metastatic, or recurrent GISTs.  Sunitinib (Sutent, second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and 
regorafenib (Stivarga, third line multi kinase inhibitor) can be used in advanced GISTs after treatment 
failure with imatinib. Recently, avapritinib (Ayvakyt) was authorized for GISTs carrying the PDGFRA 
D842V mutation. However, in the advanced setting, it is not possible to obtain a permanent cure by 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The median PFS decreases with each subsequent TKI, from 60% ORR and 
median PFS of 18-24 months with imatinib down to 5-7% ORR and median PFS of 5-6 months with 
regorafenib. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant provided two studies to support the claimed indication, the Phase 3, pivotal study DCC-
2618-03-001, and in addition supportive evidence is provided by the Dose-Response study DCC-2618-
01-001 
- 
Pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001(data cut-off: 31 May 2019): ongoing, Phase 3, 2-arm, 
randomised (2:1), placebo controlled, double-blind, international, multicentre study comparing 
the efficacy of ripretinib 150 mg QD + BSC in GIST patients who had received previous 
treatments with at least 3 prior TKI therapies (imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib; 4L+ 
population, n=129). 
-  Dose-Response study DCC-2618-01-001 (data cut
off of 01 March 2019): on-going Phase 1, 
first-in-human, dose-escalation, expansion, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
‐
tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of ripretinib in GIST patients (receiving the RP2D of 150 mg 
QD ripretinib; dose-escalation period) as 2nd (n=31), 3rd (n=28), 4th (n=46) or ≥4th (n=83) line 
of therapy.

3.1.4.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 Ripretinib+BSC vs Placebo+BSC 
• 
In the primary analysis population including patients having received at least three prior lines 
of therapy, PFS, for the ripretinib arm was 27.6 weeks (95% CI 20.0, 29.9) vs 4.1 weeks (95% 
CI 4.0, 7.3), HR 0.15 (0.09,0,25) stratified log-rank; p < ,0001 for the placebo arm. The 
subgroup analyses and the sensitivity analysis consistently favour the ripretinib arm. In the 
ripretinib arm 60% of the patients had a PFS event and in the placebo arm 84% of the patients 
had a PFS event. The PFS data are considered mature.    
•  ORR for the ripretinib arm was 9.4% vs 0% for the placebo arm, nominal p-value: 0,0504. 
•  OS for the ripretinib arm was 65.6 weeks (95% CI 53.6, 65.6) vs 28.6 weeks (95% CI 17.9, 
50.4) not statistically significant due to the prespecified hierarchical alfa-spending plan. 
• 
TTP for the ripretinib arm was 28.0 weeks (95% CI 20.0, 36.4) vs 4.1 weeks (95% CI 4.0, 7.6) 
for the placebo arm.  
•  DoR was analysed for the eight patients in PR; one patient progressed, one underwent salvage 
surgery and for the rest of the responding patients the median DoR was not reached at DCO. 
Overall, consistent results were observed for the PP population and for the analyses based on 
investigator assessment. Consistent results were also demonstrated for the relevant subgroups 
analysed, i.e. by age, gender, race, region, baseline ECOG status and number of prior systemic 
anticancer therapies. 
Updated efficacy data with DCO 10 Aug 2020, demonstrated continued efficacy with ripretinib for 
patients with advanced GIST with regard to key efficacy results for the double-blind period and 
crossover patients in the open-label period. 
Dose-Response study DCC-2618-01-001 
Supportive evidence, even if there are differences in patients’ baseline characteristics, comes from the 
non-comparative DCC-2618-01-001 study, where ORR was 7.2% in the 83 patients that received 
ripretinib after at least three prior lines of therapy. In addition, ORR was 14.3% (median DoR not 
reached) in 28 third line patients (i.e. following imatinib + sunitinib failure or intolerance) included in 
that study.  
3.1.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The size of the study (85 vs 44 patients) is limited, whereby efficacy in subgroups cannot be reliably 
assessed, and it cannot be certain that randomisation produces complete balance between arms 
regarding prognosis.  
Since ORR, the key secondary endpoint, did not reach significance at a 0.05 significance level, and due 
to the hierarchical alfa spending strategy, the OS results are not type-1 error controlled.  
A higher proportion of elderly patients (≥65 years old) was enroled in the placebo group 50% vs. 33% 
in the ripretinib treatment group, mostly driven by a higher portion of very elderly patients (10 
(22.7%) vs. 8 (9.4%) patients ≥75 years in placebo and ripretinib, respectively).  
Both the pivotal and the phase 1 study included provisions for escalating the dose of ripretinib from 
150QD to 150BID in patients with progressive disease. The problem with the data provided by the 
applicant on this matter for, is that there is no randomised control group to which outcomes can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 128/134 
 
 
 
compared and therefore, this does not isolate a drug effect. Furthermore, there are no objective 
responses to isolate drug effects.  
The intra-patient comparison of PFS is subject to uncertainty. Data are not robust enough to support a 
claim for this treatment strategy in the SmPC.  
3.1.6.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database (integrated safety analysis) include data from the pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 
(INVICTUS) and study DCC-2618-01-001 at the initial data cut-off dates of 31 May 2019 (date that the 
study was unblinded), and 01 Mar 2019, respectively. An updated 90-day safety analysis (requested 
by the FDA) with a cut-off date of 31 Aug 2019 adding data from 21 patients has also been submitted.  
The integrated safety analysis includes three main components: 
• 
Pool 1 - DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS); N=114 (85 patients from the double-blind period and 
29 patients that crossed over from the placebo-arm to ripretinib in the open label phase;  
• 
Pool 2 - The 150 mg QD subset from studies DCC-2618 01-001 and DCC-2618-03-001; 256 
patients with GIST and 39 non-GIST patients; 
• 
Pool 3 - All patients from both studies; N=351; 
The size of the safety data base in terms of GIST patients exposed at the recommended dose (relevant 
to the applied indication) is considered sufficiently comprehensive to characterize the safety profile in 
the short-term perspective given the rarity of the disease and the later line indication applied for. 
Pivotal study DCC-2618-03-001 (INVICTUS) 
Double-blind treatment period (ripretinib N=85; placebo N=43): The mean and median treatment 
durations were similar; about 6 months for ripretinib treated patients and 2 months for patients in the 
placebo arm. A total of 45.9% received ripretinib for ≥ 6 months, 18.8% ≥ 9 months and 3.5% 
beyond 12 months.  
Open label treatment period: For the 29 patients who received placebo in the double-blind period 
and opted to cross over to ripretinib 150 mg QD in the open-label phase, the treatment duration was 
shorter, about 4 months. A total of 24.1% had a treatment duration ≥ 6 months, 6.9 % ≥ 9 months 
and none beyond 12 months. A similar treatment duration was observed for the 41 patients who dose 
escalated and received ripretinib 150 mg BID in the open-label period. Six (14.6%) patients had a 
treatment duration of ≥ 6 months but none beyond 12 months. It is noted that the applicant is not 
proposing any dose increase options in the label. 
TEAEs: During the double-blind treatment period, TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in the 
ripretinib arm included alopecia (51.8%), fatigue (42.4%), nausea (38.8%), abdominal pain (36.5%), 
constipation (34.1%), myalgia (31.85%), diarrhoea (28.2%), decreased appetite (27.1%), palmar-
plantar dysaesthesia syndrome (21.2%), and vomiting (21.2%).   
By severity: A total of 49.4% were reported to have any Grade 3/4 event in the ripretinib arm. The 
most commonly reported and experienced in ≥ 5% patients were anaemia (9.4%), and abdominal pain 
and hypertension (7.1% each).  
SAEs: A total of 30.6% in the ripretinib arm experienced any treatment-emergent SAE during the 
double-blind period. The most commonly reported in ≥ 2 patients in the ripretinib arm were abdominal 
pain (4.7%), anaemia (3.5%]), nausea (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%).

EMA/CHMP/555164/2021  
Page 129/134 
 
 
 
 
Deaths: Of the 25 patients who died during the double-blind and long-term follow-up periods, 22 died 
due to progression (11 patients in each arm). Five (5.9%) patients in the ripretinib arm had TEAEs 
leading to death during study treatment or within 30 days of the last dose. These TEAEs are listed as 
hypoglycaemia (1 patient), general physical health deterioration (1 patient), and death (3 patients). All 
deaths occurring during the open label and subsequent follow-up periods until 31 May 2019 were due 
to disease progression, except for 1 patient whose cause of death was unknown. 
Analysis Pools (Integrated Analysis) 
Overall, observations in terms of relative dose intensity, mean/median time on treatment, pattern of 
TEAEs, by severity, SAEs and treatment discontinuations due to AEs in Pool 2 (GIST subset) and Pool 3 
are generally consistent with the observations in DCC-2618-03-001 study/Pool 1. TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation in Pool 3 were reported in 13.1 % with the most commonly being abdominal 
pain, cardiac failure, and fatigue (0.9% (3/351) of patients each); and ileus, vomiting, general physical 
health deterioration, sepsis, and dyspnoea (0.6% (2/351) of patients each). At the data cut-off date of 
31 Aug 2019, the corresponding proportion was about 15% across pools. From a 4th line GIST 
perspective (per the CSR), the rates of discontinuations and dose reductions due to TEAEs are 
considered low and points to a favourable tolerability of ripretinib. The frequent dose interruptions are 
not of any major concern. 
The safety profile of ripretinib as initially characterised has been confirmed by the requested updated 
safety analysis (data cut-off 10th of August 2020). No new safety concern has been identified based on 
the available data.

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.1.9.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A statistically significant and numerically large PFS benefit was noted for the ripretinib arm compared 
to the control arm, best supportive care, which is deemed reasonably robust, notwithstanding the 
smallness of the pivotal trial, allowing imbalance between baseline factors. Updated efficacy data with 
DCO 10 Aug 2020, demonstrated continued efficacy. The demonstrated effect is deemed clinically 
relevant. 
In terms of unfavourable effects, the overall high report rates in regard to TEAEs, Grade 3/4 events 
and SAEs are recognised. Reassuringly however, is the low rate of treatment discontinuations due to 
AEs and the low rate of patients that needed a dose reduction due to AEs which points to a favourable 
safety profile with manageable toxicity. The majority of deaths were due to disease progression and 
the number of deaths due to AEs does not raise any concern. The safety profile of ripretinib as initially 
characterised has been confirmed by the updated safety analysis with data cut-off 10th of August 2020. 
No new safety concern has been evoked based on this safety update.  
3.1.10.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There are no major concerns. Efficacy has been established, and the safety profile is acceptable from a 
clinical point of view.  
3.1.11.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk of Qinlock is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Qinlock is not similar to Ayvakyt within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Qinlock is favourable in the following indication: 
Qinlock is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
(GIST) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ripretinib is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
No significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan P/0122/2020 have been completed, in 
accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, after the entry into force of that 
Regulation.

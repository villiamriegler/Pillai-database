Introduction 
On August 07, 2014 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study ‘An open-label, multi-center, expanded access study of RAD001 in patients 
with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). 
The EFFECTS STUDY: Everolimus For Fast Expanded aCcess in TSC SEGA’ (EUDRACT No.: 2010-
022583-13; CRAD001MIC02) was an expanded access study designed to provide access to everolimus 
to patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex (TSC), who were without satisfactory nonsurgical treatment alternatives, until the product 
was commercially available for this indication in the respective participating country or up to 31st 
December, 2013. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Date of MA granted to Votubia 2.5 m tablets is 02/09/2011. Table 9-2 below provides details of the 
study medication of CRAD001MIC02.  
According to the protocol, the daily dose should be taken at the same time every day either 
consistently with food or consistently without food. Everolimus should be swallowed whole with a glass 
of water and the tablets should not be chewed or crushed and grapefruit or citrus juices should be 
avoided. If the tablets cannot be swallowed, the tablets should be disintegrated in approximately 30 ml 
of water. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Study initiation date was 28/03/2011, i.e. before granting a MA to Votubia in the EU. The dose 
instructions, nearly identical with the original label of Votubia 2.5, 5, and 10 mg tablets, as well as the 
dates clearly suggests that these 2.5 mg tablets investigated were ‘normal’ or ‘non-dispersible’ tablets. 
With procedure X/0008/G a line with 2, 3, and 5 mg dispersible tables have been added in 2013. 
Thus, suitable paediatric formulations were, and are meanwhile, available.

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study eudract_number:2010-022583-13 (CRAD001MIC02) “An open-label, multi-center, 
expanded access study of RAD001 in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA)

1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study 2010-022583-13 (CRAD001MIC02) “An open-label, multi-center, expanded access 
study of RAD001 in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated 
with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The EFFECTS STUDY: Everolimus For Fast Expanded 
aCcess in TSC SEGA 
Description 
Study CRAD001MIC02 was an open label, multicentre (44 centres all located within the EEA1) trial 
initiated in 2011 (first patient enrolled: 28-Mar-2011, last patient completed: 11-Mar-2014) 
investigating primarily safety of everolimus in TSC patients with SEGA in the context of an expanded 
access during the MA procedure for Votubia. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
According to the protocol primary objective was “To evaluate safety of RAD001 in patients with SEGA 
associated with TSC.” while Secondary objective “To evaluate the investigator’s best overall response 
rate of RAD001 in patients with SEGA associated with TSC.” 
Study design

List of (abnormal) laboratory parameters 
Prior participation in trial M2301 (a randomized controlled trial forming the major basis of the 
MA of Votubia in the indication SEGA) 
As to the sample size estimation the protocol states that approximately of up to 250 patients were 
planned to be enrolled and that the sample size was not based on formal power considerations; rather 
it was based on feasibility (expected accrual rates, planned duration of the trial). The actual sample 
size may differ from this planned number. 
Treatments 
Everolimus was formulated as tablets of 2.5 mg strengths for oral administration. Oral daily doses 
were to be administered at the same time every day. Starting dose was determined based on body 
surface area (see table below), dosing was then titrated to attain trough blood concentrations of 5-15 
ng/ml determined the first time 2 weeks after start of treatment. 
Table  9-3  Recommended  starting  dose 
Body Surface Area (BSA) 
≤1.2 m2 
1.3 to 2.1 m2 
≥2.2 m2 
Assessor’s comment: 
Starting daily dose 
2.5 mg 
5 mg 
7.5 mg 
Principles of the recommended initial dose as well as the method of dose titration of this trial are 
nearly identical with sec. 4.2 of the SmPC of Votubia after granting the first MA to Votubia in 2011. The 
current recommendation, however, provides a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2, thus, a higher and more 
individualised starting dose compared to the table above. Furthermore, current SmPC recommends 
earlier (than 2 weeks) determination of blood levels in children younger than 3 years (a population 
excluded in this trial).  
All patients were treated with everolimus at a once daily oral dose until either: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tumour progression (increase in SEGA volume determined by MRI) 
unacceptable toxicity (according to investigator’s medical judgment) 
death 
discontinuation from the study for any other reason 
or until the drug became commercially available for SEGA associated with TSC in the respective 
participating country or up to 31st December 2013. The latter limitation of treatment duration was 
already stated in the protocol. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: Tumor response and progression were assessed by MRI or CT scans of the brain (volume 
measurements of SEGA) at the investigators’ discretion. Tumour assessments of measurable or non-
measurabledisease/lesions were performed at screening and repeated at month 3, month 6, month 12 
and annually thereafter and at discontinuation of the study drug. Best Overall Response was the 
Investigator’s assessment of best radiological and clinical response during the study.

Safety: Safety assessments consisted of collecting Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) and laboratories 
abnormalities, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Grade 1 or 2 AEs were not to be reported, according 
to the protocol, unless they were significant for the investigator or caused a study drug dose 
modification or interruption. Adverse events were assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. 
Pharmacokinetics: For the visits 3, 4, 5 and 6, the everolimus blood levels were summarized by visit. 
All blood measurements were listed. Pre-dose trough blood samples for determination of everolimus 
concentration (Cmin) were collected immediately prior to dosing starting on Visit 3 (Week 2). Blood 
samples for PK analysis were collected locally and sent to a central laboratory to perform the analysis. 
Statistical Methods 
There were no specific statistical hypotheses which were formally tested. 
The investigator's best overall response was summarized with frequencies and percentages. 
Descriptive statistics was used for PK data analysis. 
No sample size or power calculations were performed. The proposed sample size of up to 250 patients 
was chosen based on the expected accrual rates and the planned duration of the trial; a total of 120 
patients were finally enrolled in the study. No interim analyses were performed. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The patient disposition (FAS [Full analysis set] population) is shown in Table 10-1. 
Votubia - Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Page 5/21 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 120 patients were treated in the study between 28 March 2011 and 30 June 2013 from 44 
sites in 9 countries. 
100 patients (83.3%) completed the study (i.e. they were moved to commercial drug or to local 
transition plans by 31st December 2013), 20 patients (16.7%) prematurely discontinued treatment, as 
summarized in Table 10-1 above. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population (FAS set) are shown in tables 
11-2 and 11-3 below.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Assessor’s comment: 
Since SEGA (in TSC patients) is a rare disease the patient characteristics at baseline are of note since 
they give some information on the natural course of SEGA: Median age at base-line of the patients was 
11 years, median time since TSC diagnosis 9.1 years (109.5 months), and median time since SEGA 
diagnosis 3.8 year (46 months). Study MIC02 excluded patients younger than 3 years whereas study 
M2301 had no lower age limit. About 17% of the 117 patients recruited into study M2301 were 
Votubia - Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Page 7/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
younger than 3 years demonstrating that SEGA occurs in patients younger than 3 years of age. The 
same can be seen in the lower age range of 1 year in table 11.2, representing obviously a protocol 
violation of study MIC02. In spite of these (early onset) data, trial MIC02 suggest that median time 
from TSC to SEGA diagnosis is longer than 5 years. 
Efficacy results 
The investigator’s best overall response at the end of the study for the FAS population defined as best 
radiological and clinical response (radiological response in context with toxicities or other medical 
observations of the investigator) is shown in Table 11-4. 
Assessor’s comment 
Response rate (or efficacy in general) was a secondary objective or trial MIC02 and should be 
considered, as actually determined, as “subjective best response” as judged by the local investigators. 
Median duration of study drug exposure was reported to be 396 days (ranging from 2 to 910 days). 
Taken into account that during this median study duration one progression and 2 unknown best 
responses were observed, however, it can stated that the overall pattern of the effect of everolimus on 
SEGA follows the overall result of trials C2485 and M2301 already assessed within the original MA, and 
the annual reassessments. 
PK (PD) results 
The trough (pre-dose) everolimus blood levels were evaluated for all patients at Week 2 (Visit 3). 
Everolimus blood levels were assessed at Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 6 (Visit 5) and Week 8 (Visit 6), only 
if drug dose was increased. 
Votubia - Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Page 8/21 
 
 
 
 
 
A summary of everolimus trough blood levels by visit for the FAS population is presented in Table 
14.2-1.2. 
The mean everolimus trough blood levels were below the desired range of 5-15 ng/ml at Week 2 (n= 
109 patients, 4.06 ng/ml) and at Week 4 (n= 87 patients, 4.89 ng/ml), and in the desired range at 
Week 6 (n=57 patients, 5.01 ng/ml) and at Week 8 (n=65 patients, 5.27 ng/ml). 
The correlation between everolimus blood level (ng/ml) and administered dose (mg) by visit has been 
analysed. A linear correlation between blood level and dose was observed only at Week 2 (Visit 3), 
while at Week 4, 6 and 8 no increase of blood levels was observed by increasing the dosage. 
Assessor’s comment 
The interpretation of the PK data has limits. It is stated in the protocol that “Trough blood samples 
(pre-dose) for trough RAD001 levels will be collected from all patients at week 2 (Visit 3). Samples at 
weeks 4, 6 and 8 only to be done if dose of RAD001 was increased. For the case of dose adjustments, 
RAD001 trough blood levels (pre-dose) will be assessed 1-2 weeks after any dose increase to a new 
level, or any decrease in an enzyme-inducing drug, or any increase in an enzyme-inhibiting drug.” If 
sampling was actually implemented as stated in the protocol, table 14.2-1.2 would say that in 87 of a 
maximum of 109 (i.e. in at least 80%) patients dosing was increased after Visit3/first sampling Week2. 
If so, starting dose seems to be too low, a consideration which is further supported be a median of 3.2 
(in a range of 0.7-17.9 ng/ml whereas the target range recommended was 5-15 ng/ml (as also in the 
current SmPC). 
Furthermore, since starting dose is based on body surface one should expect no correlation in-between 
dose and ctrough levels. Actually, at first sampling (Week 2) a positive correlation was observed (as 
lower the dose as lower the blood levels), a correlation which was lost once dose was titrated (i.e. 
increased) according to Week 2 blood levels. This means in effect that as smaller the patient was in 
terms of body surface, as more likely it was, following the dose instructions for starting as outlined in 
table 9.3 above, that he will be underexposed by the starting dose recommendation. 
Since the current SmPC recommends a more individualized starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2, and dispersible 
tablets at the strength of 2, 3, and 5 mg are meanwhile available to implement this dose 
recommendation more precisely, result of study MIC02, thus, indirectly confirm that preceding 
discussions of the optimization of starting dose were justified. 
Safety results 
Extent of exposure in patients 
The median daily dose of everolimus was 5.82 mg (range 2.0-11.8 mg), including days of temporary 
interruption of study drug.

The median duration of exposure for all the 120 patients was 395.5 days (range 2-910 days). 
Approximately half of the patients (57.5%) were exposed to everolimus for at least 48 weeks and one 
quarter (31.7%) for at least 88 weeks.

Study drug dose was reduced in 45 patients (37.5%). The reasons for dose reduction were: adverse 
event (34 patients), as per protocol (PK level) (5 patients), laboratory test abnormality (4 patients), 
dosing error (2 patients), scheduling conflict (1 patient), other (7 patients). Study drug was 
temporarily interrupted in 35 patients (29.2%). The reasons for dose interruption were: adverse event 
(27 patients), laboratory test abnormality (3 patients), scheduling conflict (1 patient), and other (7 
patients). Study drug was prematurely discontinued in 20 patients (16.7%). 
Concomitant medication 
Overall, 113 patients (94.2%) received concomitant medications in any ATC class after start of study 
drug. 
The most commonly used ATC drug classes were: antiepileptics (78 patients, 65.0%), antibacterial for 
systemic use (68 patients, 56.7%), ophtalmologicals (53 patients, 44.2%), analgesics (48 patients, 
40.0%), stomatological preparations (48 patients, 40.0%), anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic 
products (33 patients, 27.5%).

Adverse events regardless of study-drug relationship 
The overall incidence of adverse events was 74.2% (89 patients).  
The most common adverse events, reported in ≥ 5% of patients, were aphthous stomatitis, stomatitis, 
mouth ulceration, pyrexia, bronchitis, cough, diarrhea, headache and sinusitis. 
Patients with any adverse event of Grade 3 or 4 were 28 (23.3%): 25 patients with AEs of Grade 3 and 
3 patients with AEs of Grade 4. The most frequent adverse event of Grade 3 was stomatitis (4 patients, 
3.3%). All the other AEs of Grade 3 or 4 were reported in one to 2 patients. 
In the paediatric sub-population (90 patients age <18 years), the overall incidence of adverse events 
was 74.4% (67 patients). The most common adverse events reported (≥ 5% of patients) were pyrexia 
(16 patients, 17.8%); aphthous stomatitis (13 patients, 14.4%); bronchitis (11 patients, 12.2%); 
stomatitis (7 patients, 7.8%); sinusitis (6 patients, 6.7%); pharyngitis, pneumonia, diarrhoea, mouth

ulceration, cough, pneumonitis (5 patients, 5.6%). Patients with any adverse event of Grade 3 or 4 
were 23 (25.5%): 21 patients (23.3%) with AEs of Grade 3 and 2 patients (2.2%) with AEs of Grade 
4. 
The most frequent AE (reported in > 2% of patients) of Grade 3 was stomatitis (4 patients, 4.4%). All 
the other AEs of Grade 3 or 4 were reported in one patient each.

Assessor’s comment: 
The pattern of AEs in the paediatric population (excluding 30 adult patients) is in essence the same as 
a) in the overall population and b) in table 3 of the current SmPC describing AEs as of the two SEGA 
trials C2485 and M2301 (including its extension) listing ‘Upper respiratory tract infection’, 
‘Hypercholesterolaemia , ‘Stomatitis ‘Amenorrhoea’, ‘menstruation irregular’ as very common AEs of 
everolimus in SEGA. The only significant is that metabolism and nutrition disorders as well as

reproduction disorders occurred significantly less frequently in trial MIC02 than actually labelled in the 
current SmPC. 
Serious adverse events 
The overall incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 26.7% (32 patients). 
The most common SAEs were pyrexia (5 patients) and bronchitis (3 patients). Grade 3 SAEs were 
reported in 22 patients: hydrocephalus, pyrexia, status epilepticus, stomatitis, viral gastroenteritis, 
vomiting (2 patients each), abdominal pain, adnexal torsion, gastroenteritis, giardiasis, Haemophilus 
infection, pneumonitis, sepsis, kidney infection, lung infection, urinary tract infection, irritability, 
pneumonia, diarrhoea, extrasystoles, nephrolithiasis, neutropenia, subdural hematoma, hypokalaemia, 
headache, somnolence, pneumothorax, sinusitis, atrioventricular block, bronchitis (1 patient each). 
Grade 4 SAEs were reported in 2 patients: acute respiratory failure, pneumonia aspiration and near 
drowning in one patient; gastroenteritis in the second patient. 
In the paediatric sub-population (90 patients), the overall incidence of serious adverse events was 
27.8% (25 patients). The most common serious adverse events were pyrexia (4 patients, 4.4%) and 
bronchitis (3 patients, 3.3%). 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during the study or 28-day post treatment follow-up period. 
Important safety risks 
Important safety risks, as defined in the Afinitor/Votubia Risk Management Plan Version 9.0/Version 
8.0, were reported in the following patients: aphthous stomatitis (18 patients), severe infections (14 
patients), stomatitis (10 patients), mouth ulceration (6 patients), pneumonitis (5 patients), irregular 
menstruation (4 patients), amenorrhea (3 patients), dyslipidemia, menorrhagia, ovarian cyst (2 
patients each), proteinuria, hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, adnexal torsion and dysmenorrhea (1 
patient each). 
Assessor’s comment: 
The assessor agrees with the overall assessment of the MAH that the safety results trial MIC02 were 
consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus in TSC and no new safety concerns or 
unexpected findings were newly identified. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH discusses the clinical aspects of the submission of CSR MIC02: 
“A total of 120 patients were treated in the study, 30 adult patients (25%) and 90 pediatric 
patients (75%). 
The study confirms the acceptable safety profile of everolimus in patients < 18 years (pediatric 
sub-population) and > 18 years old, as shown by the low incidence of serious adverse events, 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and worsening of hematology/biochemistry laboratory values. 
Reported events were consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus and medically 
manageable with appropriate medical intervention. Furthermore, few premature 
discontinuations due to adverse events (6.7%) were reported, no deaths occurred during the 
Votubia - Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Page 17/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study or 28-day post treatment follow-up period and no significant changes were reported in 
vital signs from baseline to end of treatment. 
Efficacy evaluation based on the investigator’s best overall response showed a partial response 
for most patients (67.5%). 
No changes to the pediatric information of the current Afinitor/Votubia (everolimus) Core Data 
Sheet are therefore proposed as a result of this study, and no regulatory consequences of the 
submitted study are anticipated for the pediatric information in the European Summary of 
Product Characteristics (EU SPC). 
In conclusion, the benefit to risk relationship for everolimus remains positive for the currently 
approved indications and justifies continuation of the development program in pediatric 
patients.” 
The assessor agrees with this overall conclusion. It can be added that study MIC02 shows that the 
initially recommended starting dose recommended in the SmPC was obviously too low and just has 
been replaced by a more individualised and higher starting dose in the current SmPC. 
2.  Additional clarifications requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide a clarification as to the requirement to update 
section 4.8 (+/- sec. 5.1) of the SmPC (+/-PIL) of Votubia as part of this procedure in order to bring in 
line this information with the new clinical data available now from study CSR MIC02 as follows: 
1.  Since the recommended initial dose in study MIC02 (see table 9.3 above) was lower and less 
precise than currently recommended in the SmPC (4.5 mg/m2), the MAH should provide blood 
level simulations at week 2 under the assumption that patients would have received a starting 
dose of 4.5 mg/m2. The MAH should comment on the frequency of required dose adjustments 
after week 2, following current SmPC recommendation, in an age dependent manner. 
2.  An OMS comment requested the CHMP to consider the addition of the safety results of study 
MIC02 under Section 4.8 – Paediatric Population which currently reflects the paediatric 
experience from the pivotal studies. This would allow informing prescribers about ongoing 
experience with Everolimus in children, confirming an unchanged and consistent safety profile. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the OMS comment is right in the way that the new (safety) 
data would allow to broaden the safety data base as described in section 4.8 of the current 
Votubia SmPC  (without affecting the content essentially). The MAH is requested to reconsider 
this suggestion (including also thoughts on changes to sec. 5.1 of the SmPC & PIL), and to 
make an appropriate proposal for an update of the summary of safety, and changes to the PI 
within this procedure accordingly. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

3.  Assessment of responses 
Response of the MAH to question 1 
Reference is made to the enclosed [PK simulation report], providing PK simulation in typical patients 
with SEGA in an age dependent manner to attain steady state PK trough levels in the target range 
based on the current SmPC and on protocol used in Study CRAD001MIC02. 
In conclusion, the simulations support the current SmPC. The starting dose recommendation of 4.5 
mg/m2 in the SmPC should result in fewer dose adjustments during titration and thus a shorter length 
of time to attain steady state trough levels in the target range of 5-15 ng/mL compared to the starting 
dose used in Study MIC02 protocol. 
Assessment of Response to question 1 
The MAH has submitted the requested simulations as a separate report. 
PK simulations made based on the developed PopPK model taking into account the different dosing 
regimens, especially the actually recommended starting dose in the current SmPC, are appreciated.  
Simulations of 24 different scenarios have been made, for 3 different dosing regimen: dosing with 
dispersible tablet or with regular tablet according to the SmPC dosing regimen and dosing with regular 
tablets according to the dosing regimen used in Study MIC02. The patient characteristics were 
combinations of inducer status (absent and present), and BSA of patient (0.5 m2, 1.0 m2, 1.5 m2 and 
2.0 m2). The BSA values chosen correspond to a toddler, a child, and two sizes of adults. Simulations 
showed that the current SmPC recommendations improved dosing with respect to attaining target 
Cmin concentrations. For the simulations reflecting SmPC dosing with dispersible or regular tablets, in 
5 of the 8 scenarios target Cmin concentrations were directly achieved with the recommended initial 
dose. On the contrary, with the dosing regimen of study MIC02, in each of the eight scenarios, a dose 
adjustment was needed, in one scenario dose had even to be adjusted two times. 
Nevertheless, also with the dosing schedule defined in the SmPC, dose adjustments were needed for 
the group of toddlers, the group of toddlers with additional inducers and for children with additional 
inducers, because with the currently proposed initial dose resulting Cmin concentrations were below 
the therapeutic concentration range. 
For the two patient groups taking additional inducers, this seems acceptable since dosing of inducers 
can be different between patients and the influence of different inducers might impact the 
concentrations differently so this should be managed by individual dose titration via TDM. 
On the contrary, it is considered not acceptable that the toddlers in general will need a dose 
adjustment with the current SmPC initial dose, and thus also an additional blood sample for 
confirmation of the achieved concentration. Therefore further simulations should be done to find out 
the optimal initial dose for toddlers to directly attain Cmin concentrations in the therapeutic range. 
Issue to be resolved by a type II variation 
Response of the MAH to question 2 
Novartis appreciates the suggestion to include safety and efficacy claims into the SmPC based on 
Study MIC02, however would like to respectfully put forward the following points to the attention of the 
reviewer: 
Votubia - Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The TSC safety pool currently presented in the Votubia SmPC (derived from the Company Core Data 
Sheet) includes data from two studies in the TSC-SEGA population (CRAD001C2485 and 
CRAD001M2301, with cut-off dates of 12-Dec-2012 and 11-Jan-2013 respectively), as well as from 
one study in the TSC- Renal Angiomyolipoma population (CRAD001M2302), with a cut-off date of 01-
May-2013. 
An updated Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) table in section 4.8 of the SmPC will be submitted to the 
Agency by end of March 2015, along with the submission of the final CSR of Study M2301 (as 
fulfillment of the Specific Obligation to complete Post-authorization measures for the conditional 
Marketing Authorisation – Annex II section E). The final data from C2485 and M2301 studies will be 
integrated into the TSC safety pool, reflecting the long-term follow-up of patients for a median 
duration of exposure of 67.8 months in Study C2485 and 47.1 months in Study M2301. 
The TSC safety pool will be further expanded with the planned integration of final data of study 
CRAD001M2302. Submission to the Agency along with the final CSR of study CRAD001M2302 will take 
place by Aug-2015 (as fulfillment of the Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective 
use of the medicinal product – Annex II section D). 
CRAD001MIC02 is an open-label post-marketing expanded access study. Per protocol, investigators 
were requested to report grade 1 or 2 adverse events, laboratory or test procedure abnormalities only 
if/when they caused a study drug dose modification or interruption (study protocol section 7.5; CSR 
section 9.5.3.2). Patients in MIC02 also had a lower median duration of exposure of study medication 
compared to the overall safety pool. The median duration of exposure in study MIC02 was 395.5 days; 
this low median duration of exposure can be explained by the fact that many patients moved out of the 
study early, switching to commercial drug when available or to local transition plans at study sites. 
This represents a median exposure 3 times less than the median duration of the TSC patients in the 
safety pool which is slightly higher than 4 years. These differences contribute to an overall observed 
ADRs reporting rate being substantially lower compared to those observed previously in the 3 studies 
currently included in the safety pool (51.7 % in Study MIC02 versus 93.6% in the current safety pool). 
For these reasons, Novartis considers study CRAD001MIC02 to be less appropriate than studies C2485, 
M2301 and M2302 for inclusion into the TSC safety pool which is the basis for the ADR table in the EU 
SmPC section 4.8. Therefore, Novartis does not propose to make any safety claim related to Study 
MIC02 in section 4.8. 
Consistently, Novartis does not consider suitable to add any efficacy claims related to MIC02 study in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. As emphasized by the CHMP in his assessment report, efficacy was a 
secondary objective and should be considered, as actually determined, as “subjective best response” 
as judged by the local investigators, whereas the definition of the best overall SEGA response” in the 
C2485 and M2301 studies was based on three objective criteria measured at each radiological 
assessment by a central review: the reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, the absence of 
unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, the absence of new SEGA lesions (≥ 1 cm in longest 
diameter), and the absence of new or worsening hydrocephalus. 
Assessment of Response to question 2 
Both the pharmacovigilance and clinical assessors of the Rapporteur agree that the argument of 
(shorter) exposure (and the so, or by design, caused lower frequencies of ADRs reporting of) trial 
MIC02 compared to the current SEGA safety pool (M2302 and C2485) put forward by the MAH is a 
valid argument for not pooling these data with the current safety pool.

The CHMP would like to add that this assessment per se does not preclude reporting safety data as of 
trial MIC02 separately in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Since the MAH, however, states clearly that he will 
not make any safety (and efficacy) claim related to study MIC02 (such as e.g. lowering frequencies in 
the label of AEs), the CHMP is of the opinion that it is also not needed to indicate in the SmPC that the 
safety pool in paediatric SEGA is actually larger than the pool used to label AEs in section 4.8. 
Issue resolved 
4.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Safety and efficacy finding of newly submitted study MIC02 in SEGA patients are fully in accordance 
with results of study C2485 and M2301 already labelled. The benefit-risk of Votubia remains positive. 
However, PK simulations submitted upon additional clarification request indicate that the currently 
recommended starting dose in toddlers (BSA < 0.5 m2) could be too low. E.g. a 6 mg/m2 starting dose 
[in place of the currently recommended of 4.5 mg/m2] might be more appropriate to achieve cmin in 
the therapeutic range of 5-15 ng/ml already in the first week of treatment. Thus, with a higher starting 
dose in toddlers steady state concentrations in the therapeutic range can be achieved faster which in 
addition would reduce further PK monitoring. The decision to recommend a specific, higher starting 
dose, however, needs further simulations. 
In addition, in children younger than 1 year of age metabolism via cytochromes might still be 
immature. The MAH should clarify whether a warning informing about the immaturity of CYP3A4 
metabolic transformation justifies a warning giving this information – in particular provided that new 
simulations requested will probably render it necessary to recommend a higher starting dose in 
toddlers (= patients younger than 3 years of age). 
Recommendation  
  The post-authorisation measure is fulfilled: 
A Type II variation is requested from the MAH by 31st of August 2015 to amend the product 
information as follows: 
Simulations should be carried out in order to define an appropriate initial dose for patients below the 
age of 3 years which will directly lead to trough concentrations in the therapeutic range of 5-15 ng/ml. 
Subsequently, section 4.2 should be updated according to the newly defined dosing regimen in children 
below the age of 3 years (or in the age of 1-3 years, see below). 
In addition, the MAH should consider the potential immaturity of CYP3A4 in children below the age of 1 
year which might lead to lower clearances and longer half-lives of everolimus in this age group. The 
MAH should summarize and describe all PK data available from patients <1 year and evaluate whether 
there are indications that in this rare patient population alterations in PK may occur. The MAH should 
propose a comment on this to be mentioned in the SmPC in section 4.4.

Posology  
The recommended dose is 100 mg administered by intravenous infusion every 12 weeks. Some 
patients may benefit from a dosage of 300 mg administered by intravenous infusion every 12 weeks 
(see section 5.1). 
The need for dose escalation should be assessed within 12 weeks after initiation of the treatment. 
When switching dosage, the first dose of the new regimen should be given on the next scheduled 
dosing date. 
Overall benefit and continuation of treatment should be assessed 6 months after initiation of the 
treatment. Any further decision to continue the treatment should be made on an individual patient 
basis. 
Special Populations  
Elderly (aged 65 years and over) 
There is limited data available for the use of VYEPTI in patients ≥65 years of age. No dose adjustment 
is required in the elderly patients as the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab were not affected by age. 
Renal impairment/hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (see section 
5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of VYEPTI in children aged 6 to 18 years has not yet been established. 
Currently no data are available. 
There is no relevant use of VYEPTI in children below the age of 6 years for the prophylaxis of 
migraine. 
Method of administration  
VYEPTI is for intravenous use only after dilution. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product prior to administration, see section 6.6. 
Following dilution, infuse VYEPTI, over approximately 30 minutes. 
The treating healthcare professional should observe or monitor patients during and after the infusion in 
accordance with normal clinical practice. 
Do not administer VYEPTI as a bolus injection. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

Patients with cardiovascular, neurological or psychiatric diseases 
Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension, ischemic heart disease) were 
excluded from clinical studies (see section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. Limited 
safety data are available in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, circulatory 
diseases and hyperlipidaemia. 
Patients with a history of neurological diseases or patients with psychiatric conditions that were 
uncontrolled and/or untreated were excluded from the clinical studies. Limited safety data are 
available in these patients. 
Serious hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported and may 
develop within minutes of the infusion. Most hypersensitivity reactions occurred during infusion and 
were not serious (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of 
VYEPTI should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. If the hypersensitivity 
reaction is not serious, continuation of further treatment with VYEPTI is up to the discretion of the 
treating physician, taking into account the benefit-risk for the individual patient. 
Excipients  
VYEPTI contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be 
given this medicinal product unless strictly necessary. 
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given 
this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Eptinezumab is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, interactions by 
eptinezumab with concomitant medications that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome 
P450 enzymes are considered unlikely. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited data from the use of eptinezumab in pregnant women. Animal studies with 
eptinezumab do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, eptinezumab may be 
transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VYEPTI during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data on the presence of eptinezumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or 
the effects on milk production. Human IgG is known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few 
days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterward; consequently, a risk to the 
breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, use of eptinezumab could be 
considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed.   
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
The effect of eptinezumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies with 
eptinezumab showed no impact on female and male fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
VYEPTI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Over 2000 patients have been treated with VYEPTI in clinical studies, Of these, approximately 1000 
patients were exposed for 48 weeks (four doses). 
the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity. Most hypersensitivity 
reactions occurred during infusion and were not serious. Infusion site related adverse events occurred 
infrequently and in similar proportions of VYEPTI and placebo patients (< 2%) with no apparent 
relationship to VYEPTI dose. The most frequently occurring infusion-site related adverse event was 
infusion site extravasation, which occurred in < 1% of VYEPTI and placebo patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience (table 1)  are classified by 
MedDRA system organ classification and frequency. Frequencies have been evaluated according to 
the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Nasopharyngitis 
Approximately 8% of patients on 300 mg, 6% of patients on 100 mg and 6% of patients on placebo in 
PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 experienced nasopharyngitis. Nasopharyngitis was most frequent after 
the first dose of VYEPTI at any dose. The incidence decreased notably with subsequent doses and 
remained fairly steady thereafter.

Hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported and may 
develop within minutes of the infusion (see section 4.4). The reported anaphylactic reactions have 
included symptoms of hypotension and respiratory difficulties, and have led to discontinuation of 
VYEPTI.  Other hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, flushing, rash and 
pruritus, were reported in approximately 4% of patients on 300 mg, 3% of patients on 100 mg and 1% 
of patients on placebo in PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2. 
Other symptoms reported in association with eptinezumab infusion include respiratory symptoms 
(nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, cough, sneezing, dyspnea) and fatigue (see below). 
Most of these events were non-serious and transient in nature. 
Fatigue 
Approximately 3% of patients on eptinezumab and 2% of patients on placebo in the placebo-
controlled clinical trials experienced fatigue. Fatigue was most frequent on the day of the first 
infusion. Following the first week and with subsequent infusions, fatigue was reported in lower 
incidences and the incidences were comparable to placebo. 
Immunogenicity  
In the clinical studies, PROMISE 1 (up to 56 weeks) and PROMISE 2 (up to 32 weeks), the incidence 
of anti-eptinezumab antibodies across both studies was 18% (105/579) and 20% (115/574) in patients 
receiving 100 mg and 300 mg every 12 weeks, respectively. In both studies, the incidence of anti-
eptinezumab antibodies peaked at week 24 and thereafter showed a steady decline even after 
subsequent dosing every 12 weeks. The incidence of neutralizing antibodies across both studies was 
8.3% (48/579) and 6.1% (35/574) for the 100 mg and 300 mg treatment groups, respectively. 
In an open-label study, PREVAIL (up to 96 weeks of treatment with 300 mg VYEPTI every 
12 weeks), 18% (23/128) of patients developed anti-eptinezumab antibodies with an overall incidence 
of neutralizing antibodies of 7% (9/128). 5.3% patients were ADA positive at week 48, 4% were ADA 
positive at week 72, and all patients, except one patient lost to follow up, were ADA negative at 
week 104 (the last assessment in the study).  
In the clinical studies, eptinezumab trough plasma concentrations appeared lower in patients who 
developed anti-eptinezumab antibodies. There was no evidence of impact of anti-eptinezumab 
antibody development on efficacy or safety in the clinical studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 1000 mg have been administered intravenously to humans without tolerability issues or 
clinically significant adverse reactions. 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures 
instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC 
code: N02CD05. 
Mechanism of action 
Eptinezumab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds to α- and β- 
forms of human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand with low picomolar affinity (4 and 
3 pM Kd, respectively). Eptinezumab prevents the activation of the CGRP receptors and hence the 
downstream cascade of physiological events linked to initiation of migraine attacks. 
Eptinezumab inhibits α and β- CGRP-mediated neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation. 
Eptinezumab is highly selective (>100,000-fold vs related neuropeptides amylin, calcitonin, 
adrenomedullin and intermedin).  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
VYEPTI (eptinezumab) was evaluated for the preventive treatment of migraine in two pivotal 
placebo-controlled studies: PROMISE 1 was conducted in patients with episodic migraine (n=888) 
and PROMISE 2 in patients with chronic migraine (n=1072). Enrolled patients had a history of 
migraine (with or without aura) of at least 12 months, according to the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders (ICHD-II or III) diagnostic criteria.  
PROMISE 1: episodic migraine 
PROMISE 1 was a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of VYEPTI for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. 665 patients were 
randomized to receive placebo (N=222), 100 mg eptinezumab (N=221), or 300 mg eptinezumab 
(N=222) every 12 weeks for 48 weeks (4 infusions). Episodic migraine was defined as ≥4 and 
≤14 headache days of which at least 4 had to be migraine days in each 28-day period in the 3 months 
prior to screening and confirmed during baseline period. Patients were allowed concurrent acute 
migraine or headache medications, including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine 
derivatives), during the study. Regular use (greater than 7 days per month) of other treatments for the 
prevention of migraine was not allowed. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMD) 
over weeks 1-12. The key secondary endpoints included ≥50% and ≥75% migraine responder rates 
defined as the proportion of patients achieving at least the specified percent reduction in migraine days 
over weeks 1-12, ≥75% migraine responder rate over weeks 1-4, and the percentage of patients with a 
migraine on the day after the first dosing (day 1). 
Patients had a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 71 years), 84% were women, and 84% were white. 
At baseline the mean number of migraine days per month at baseline was 8.6 and the rate of patients 
with a migraine on a given day was 31%; both were similar across treatment groups. 
Reduction in mean monthly migraine days from placebo for both doses was observed from the first 
day after administration.

PROMISE 2 was a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled global study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of VYEPTI for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults. A total of 
1,072 patients were randomized and received placebo (N=366), 100 mg eptinezumab (N=356), or 
300 mg eptinezumab (N=350) every 12 weeks for 24 weeks (2 infusions). Chronic migraine was 
defined as ≥ 15 to ≤26 headache days, of which ≥8 were assessed as migraine days in the 3 months 
prior to screening and confirmed during the 28-day screening period. During the study, patients were 
allowed acute or preventive medication for migraine or headache on an established stable regimen 
(except for onabotulinumtoxinA).  
A total of 431 patients (40%) with a dual diagnosis of chronic migraine and medication overuse 
headache (associated with the overuse of triptans, ergotamine, or combination analgesics 
>10 days/month, or acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
≥15 days/month) confirmed during screening period were included in the study population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMD over weeks 1-12. The key 
secondary endpoints included ≥50% and ≥75% migraine responder rates defined as the proportion of 
patients achieving the specified percent reduction in migraine days over weeks 1-12, ≥75% migraine 
responder rate over weeks 1-4, the percentage of patients with a migraine on the day after dosing, the 
reduction in migraine prevalence from baseline to week 4, the change from baseline in the total score 
on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) at week 12 (300 mg dose only), and the change from baseline in 
acute monthly migraine medication days, mean over weeks 1-12 (300 mg dose only).  
Patients had a mean age of 41 years (range: 18 to 65 years), 88% were women, and 91% were white. 
Forty-one percent of patients were taking concomitant preventive medication for migraine. At baseline 
the mean number of migraine days per month at baseline was 16.1 and the rate of patients with a 
migraine on a given day was 57.6%; both were similar across treatment groups.

PREVAIL: long-term study 
VYEPTI 300 mg was administered every 12 weeks by IV infusion for up to 96 weeks in 128 patients 
with chronic migraine. The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety following repeated 
doses of VYEPTI. Secondary objectives included characterization of the PK and immunogenicity 
profiles for VYEPTI (section 4.8) and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of VYEPTI on several 
patient reported outcomes relating to migraine and quality of life including the Headache Impact Test 
(HIT-6). Patients had a mean age of 41.5 years (range: 18 to 65 years), 85% were women, 95% were 
white, and 36% took concomitant preventive medication for migraine. The mean number of migraine 
days per 28-day period in the 3 months preceding screening was 14.1 days. In total, 100 patients 
(78.1%) completed the study (week 104). Patients were severely impacted at baseline with a mean 
total HIT-6 of 65. The mean change from baseline through week 104 was -9.7 (p<0.0001). The safety 
profile was consistent with the safety profiles observed in the randomized, placebo-controlled studies, 
and a sustained effect on patient-relevant outcomes was observed for up to 96 weeks. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VYEPTI in one or more subset of the paediatric population in the preventive treatment of migraine 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use) 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
As VYEPTI is administered intravenously, it is 100% bioavailable. Eptinezumab exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics and exposure increases proportionally with doses from 10 to 1000 mg. Steady-state 
is attained after the first-dose during a once every 12 weeks dosing schedule. Median time to 
maximum concentration (Cmax) is 30 minutes (end-of-infusion), and the average terminal elimination 
half-life is 27 days. The mean accumulation ratios based on Cmax and AUC0-tau are 1.08 and 1.15, 
respectively.   
Absorption 
VYEPTI is administered by intravenous infusion which bypasses extravascular absorption and is 
100% bioavailable. Median time to peak concentration was attained at the end of infusion 
(30 minutes). 
Distribution 
The central volume of distribution (Vc) for eptinezumab was approximately 3.7 litres. 
Biotransformation 
Eptinezumab is expected to be degraded by proteolytic enzymes into small peptides and amino acids. 
Elimination 
Eptinezumab apparent clearance was 0.15 L/day, and the terminal elimination half-life was 
approximately 27 days. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis including 2 123 subjects explored the effect of age, gender, 
ethnicity and body weight on the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab. Relative to a 70 kg subject, steady 
state exposure of eptinezumab in a 190 kg subject was up to 52% lower, whereas is would be up to 
50% higher in a 39 kg subject. However, from the exposure-response evaluation, there was no effect 
of body weight on the clinical efficacy. No dose adjustment is required based on body weight. The 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab were not affected by age (18-71), gender or race based on 
population pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed. 
Renal or hepatic Impairment 
No dedicated hepatic or renal impairment studies were conducted to assess the effects of hepatic and 
renal impairment upon the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
integrated data from the VYEPTI clinical studies did not reveal any differences in patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment that would require dose adjustment. No data for patients with severe renal 
impairment are available. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, juvenile toxicity, or toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenesis  
As eptinezumab is unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, evaluations 
for potential genotoxicity were considered unnecessary and not performed.  
As no carcinogenicity risk has been identified by extensive evaluation of the literature related to 
inhibition of CGRP and as no eptinezumab-related proliferative findings were observed in long term 
studies in monkeys, carcinogenicity testing was considered unnecessary and not performed.

vials or 3.0 mL of VYEPTI from one single-use 300 mg vial using a sterile needle and syringe. Inject 
the resulting 3.0 mL (300 mg) content into a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. 
Infusion administration instructions  
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if the liquid contains 
visible particulate matter or is cloudy or discolored. 
Infuse VYEPTI 100 mg dose or VYEPTI 300 mg dose as prescribed, following dilution of the vial 
content in a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, over approximately 30 minutes. Use 
an intravenous infusion set with a 0.2 or 0.22 μm in-line or add-on filter. After the infusion is 
complete, flush the line with 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. 
Do not administer VYEPTI as a bolus injection.  
No other medications should be administered through the infusion set or mixed with VYEPTI. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local 
requirements.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What VYEPTI is and what it is used for 
VYEPTI contains the active substance eptinezumab, which blocks the activity of calcitonin gene-
related peptide (CGRP), a naturally occurring substance in the body. People with migraine may have 
increased levels of this substance. 
VYEPTI is used to prevent migraine in adults who have migraine at least 4 days per month. 
VYEPTI can reduce the number of days with migraine and improve your quality of life. You may feel 
the preventive effect starting the day after receiving this medicine. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given VYEPTI  
Do not use VYEPTI 
• 
if you are allergic to eptinezumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before being given VYEPTI if you have disease affecting the heart and 
blood circulation.  
VYEPTI can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can develop quickly even while the 
medicine is being given. Tell your doctor immediately if you get any symptoms of an allergic reaction, 
such as:  
•  breathing difficulty 
• 
a fast or weak pulse or a sudden drop in blood pressure which makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
swelling of the lips or tongue 
severe itching of the skin or rash while you receive VYEPTI, or afterwards 
Children and adolescents 
VYEPTI is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years because it has not been 
studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and VYEPTI 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine.  
It is preferable to avoid the use of VYEPTI during pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in 
pregnant women are not known. 
It is not known if VYEPTI passes into breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide if you should stop 
breast-feeding or stop VYEPTI treatment. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk 
to your doctor before being treated with VYEPTI. You and your doctor should decide if you should 
breast-feed and be treated with VYEPTI. 
Driving and using machines 
VYEPTI has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. 
VYEPTI contains sorbitol 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which 
may cause serious side effects. 
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI. 
3. 
How to use VYEPTI 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.  
VYEPTI is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein. The infusion lasts about 30 minutes. VYEPTI will be 
given to you by a healthcare professional, who prepares the infusion before giving it to you. During 
and after the infusion the healthcare professional will observe you  in accordance with normal clinical 
practice  for signs of an allergic reaction. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg given every 12 weeks. Some patients may benefit from a dose of 
300 mg given every 12 weeks. Your doctor will decide the right dose for you and how long you should 
continue to be treated. 
If you use more VYEPTI than you should 
Because the medicine will be given to you by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely you will receive 
too much VYEPTI. Inform your doctor if you think this has happened. 
If you forget to use VYEPTI 
If a dose is missed, your doctor will decide when the next dose should be given. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for dilution and administration 
The medicinal product requires dilution prior to administration. The dilution should be prepared by a 
healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared solution for 
infusion.  
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The medicinal product contains no preservative and is intended for single use only and any unused 
medicinal product should be disposed. 
Prior to dilution, the medicinal product (concentrate in the vials) should be inspected visually; do not 
use if the concentrate contains visible particulate matter or is cloudy or discoloured (other than clear to 
slightly opalescent, colourless to brownish-yellow). 
For both the 100 mg and the 300 mg dose, a 100 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection should be used to prepare the VYEPTI solution for infusion as described below. No other 
intravenous diluents or volume may be used to prepare the VYEPTI solution for infusion.  
Gently invert the VYEPTI solution for infusion to mix completely. Do not shake. 
Following dilution, VYEPTI solution for infusion must be infused within 8 hours. During this time, 
VYEPTI solution for infusion may be stored at room temperature (below 25°C) or refrigerated at 
2°C - 8°C. If stored at 2°C - 8°C, allow the VYEPTI solution for infusion to warm to room 
temperature prior to infusion. DO NOT FREEZE.  
•  VYEPTI 100 mg dose 
To prepare the VYEPTI solution for infusion, withdraw 1.0 mL of VYEPTI from one single-use 
100 mg vial using a sterile needle and syringe. Inject the 1.0 mL (100 mg) content into a 100 mL 
bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection 
•  VYEPTI 300 mg dose 
To prepare the VYEPTI solution for infusion, withdraw 1.0 mL of VYEPTI from 3 single-use 
100 mg vials or 3.0 mL of VYEPTI from one single-use 300 mg vial using a sterile needle and 
syringe. Inject the resulting 3.0 mL (300 mg) content into a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride 
for injection. 
Infusion administration instructions  
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if the liquid contains 
visible particulate matter or is cloudy or discolored. 
Infuse VYEPTI 100 mg dose or VYEPTI 300 mg dose as prescribed, following dilution of the vial 
content in a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, over approximately 30 minutes. Use 
an intravenous infusion set with a 0.2 or 0.22 μm in-line or add-on filter. After the infusion is 
complete, flush the line with 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. 
Do not administer VYEPTI as a bolus injection.  
No other medications should be administered through the infusion set or mixed with VYEPTI. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local 
requirements.

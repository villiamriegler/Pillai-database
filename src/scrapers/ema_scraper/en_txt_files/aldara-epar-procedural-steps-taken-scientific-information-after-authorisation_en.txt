C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
on re-treating actinic keratosis lesions that have cleared 
after one or two courses of treatment and subsequently 
recur. If the treated area does not show complete clearance 
at a follow-up examination about 8 weeks after the last 4-
weeks course of treatment, an additional 4-weeks course of 
Aldara treatment may be considered.  
A different therapy is recommended if the treated lesion(s) 
shows insufficient response to Aldara. 
Actinic keratosis lesions that have cleared after one or two 
courses of treatment and subsequently recur can be re-
treated with one or two further courses of Aldara cream 
following an at least 12 weeks treatment pause.

Basal Cell Carcinoma (sBCC), to implement the 
standard term "Cutaneous Use" instead of the 
previous "For cutaneous use" in the Labelling and to

assessed within the procedure Aldara II-42, the adverse 
events which occurred more frequently in children receiving 
imiquimod were application site disorders and application 
site reactions. A review of the local skin reactions indicated 
no obvious difference in incidence or severity when 
compared to studies in adults, and this was reflected 
accordingly in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The data obtained 
from these studies in children did not indicate any 
differences in the safety profile compared to adults.

On the basis of the observed results at the timepoint of the 
Package Leaflet 
To update sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC to reflect 
four-year follow-up data from two clinical studies 
assessing recurrence rates of superficial basal cell 
carcinoma (sBCC). 
Additionally a warning in section 4.4 "Special 
warnings and special precautions for use" concerning 
the potential consequences of not allowing time for 
sufficient healing of the skin prior to Aldara 
48-month follow-up of two open-label studies evaluating 
the safety and long-term clinical efficacy of imiquimod 5% 
cream studies, the CHMP agreed to amend the statement in 
section 5.1 of the SPC regarding long-term clearance in 
sBCC . An estimated 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%-84.9%)] of 
all the subjects who initially received treatment became 
clinically clear and remained clear at 48 months, while data 
on recurrence rates beyond 48 months are not yet 
available. 
Further to the CHMP request following the assessment of 
Page 12/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 10th PSUR, to expand the following warning in section 
4.4 "Imiquimod cream therapy is not recommended until 
the skin has healed after any previous drug or surgical 
treatment", the CHMP agreed on the additional statement 
in section 4.4 of the SPC saying that application of Aldara 
to broken skin could result in increased systemic absorption 
of imiquimod leading to a greater risk of adverse events. 
administration was expanded as requested by CHMP 
in July 2006 following the evaluation of PSUR 10. 
The MAH also took the opportunity of this variation 
to correct translation errors in the Dutch, Greek and 
Norwegian Product Information (PI).

"Pharmacokinetic properties" of the SPC have been 
updated. Furthermore, following a review on adverse 
reactions, section 4.8 was updated to introduce 
alopecia, reduction in haematological parameters 
requiring clinical intervention and dermatological 
drug reactions. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been 
updated accordingly.  
The MAH took the opportunity to update the annexes 
according to the latest QRD templates. 
Additionally, the package leaflet has been amended 
following user testing results. The MAH also took the 
opportunity of this change to amend the list of local 
representatives for Iceland, the Netherlands, and 
Estonia and to correct a number of errors in the 
translations that have been identified in all languages 
except Czech.

cell carcinoma (sBCC) in adult patients was granted in 
2004. The clinical trial programme for this indication 
included two ongoing long-term phase III studies to assess 
recurrence rates of sBCCs up to five years after treatment 
with imiquimod 5% cream, 5x/week (study 1412-IMIQ) or 
7x/week (study 1413-IMIQ) for 6 weeks.  
The MAH committed to submit results from these studies at 
yearly intervals and at the end of the five-year follow-up 
period.   
With this variation the MAH updated the SPC based on the 
second of the interim reports for studies 1412 and 1413,

Precautions for use in patients with autoimmune 
a warning for patients who are receiving 
immunosuppressive medication for (auto)immune 
conditions, following the evaluation of the PSUR 9. 
Furthermore, following concerns stated in the 
evaluation of the PSUR 9 the MAH requested to 
update section 4.4 to include a sentence to avoid the 
contact with the lips and nostrils and to remove a 
statement regarding limited use in patients older 
than 65. Additionally, the MAH took the opportunity 
of this variation to include in section 4.4 a 
recommendation for interruption of dosing in the 
event of flu-like symptoms. Section 2 of the PL was 
revised to include a warning regarding use near the 
eyes, lips and nostrils. The MAH also took the 
opportunity of this variation to correct translation 
errors in the Spanish, French and Italian SPC, Dutch, 
Swedish and Hungarian SPC and PL and in the 
Lithuanian, Slovakian and Slovenian PL. 
conditions: following the evaluation of PSUR 9 (covering 
the period from 27 February 2004 to 26 February 2005), 
the MAH submitted this type II variation to update section 
4.4 and 4.5 to warn prescribers to exercise caution when 
treating patients who are receiving immunosuppressive 
medication for (auto)immune conditions and advise 
balancing the benefit of imiquimod treatment with the 
potential risks for these patients. Furthermore, section 4.8 
of the SPC was updated to state that rare reports have 
been received of exacerbation of autoimmune conditions. 
Precautions for use in organ transplant patients: the 
systemic concentration of Aldara is likely to be very low in 
the majority of patients. However, remains a theoretical 
chance that it attenuates the action of immuno-
suppressants. Since graft-versus-host disease and the 
rejection of an organ are potentially life-threatening 
adverse effects, and since immuno-suppressed patients are 
more likely to require imiquimod therapy, it is important 
that prescribers are made aware of this and of the need to

assessment. Section 4.4 of the SPC was updated to reflect 
this information. 
Precautions for use near the eyes and nose: based on a 
review of all reactions that have occurred where Aldara was 
administered close to the eyes, nose, lips and hairline the 
warning in section 4.4 of the SPC and in section 2 of the PL 
to "avoid contact with the eyes" was extended to the lips 
and nostrils. Furthermore, an advice was introduced in 
section 2 of the PL on what action to take in the event that 
Aldara is accidentally applied to the eyes, lips and nostrils. 
Precautions for use in patients older than 65 years: since a 
large number of patients over the age of 65 years have 
been studied in clinical trials for sBCC and for actinic 
keratoses the statement regarding limited use in patients 
older than 65 was removed from section 4.4 of the SPC.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for the 
extension of the therapeutic indication to include patients 
with superficial basal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, the MAH 
took the opportunity of the variation to update section 4.8 
("Undesirable effects") according to MedDRA, following a 
request from the CPMP in July 2003. The Package Leaflet 
(PL) has been revised accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
completed the list of local representatives in the PL to 
include the 10 new EU Member States and changed the 
format according to the latest EMEA/QRD template.

section 4.4 regarding advice to uncircumcised men and 
sections 4.8 and 5.1 "Pharmacodynamic properties" 
concerning the likely application site reactions as a 
consequence of the mode of action. Finally the MAH 
amended section 6.4 " Special precautions for storage" to 
indicate that sachets should not be reused once opened. 
Relevant changes are equally proposed for the PL. In 
addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been 
revised.

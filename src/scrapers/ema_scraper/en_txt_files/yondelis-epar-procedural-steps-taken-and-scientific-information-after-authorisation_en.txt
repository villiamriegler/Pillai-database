are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
21 February 2020 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency further to review of study 3306 
and its impact on the benefit-risk balance of the 
ovarian cancer indication. The CHMP was requested 
to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk 
balance of Yondelis and to give its recommendation 
whether the marketing authorisation of this product 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.

events or myocardial dysfunction. 
A thorough cardiac assessment including determination of 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram 
or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) should be conducted 
before initiation of trabectedin and at 2 to 3-month 
intervals thereafter until trabectedin is discontinued. 
Patients with LVEF less than the lower limit of normal (LVEF 
< LLN), prior cumulative anthracycline dose of 
>300mg/m2, aged >65 years, or a history of 
cardiovascular disease (especially in those with cardiac 
medication) may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction 
at treatment with trabectedin as monotherapy or in 
combination with doxorubicin. 
For patients with Grade 3 or 4 cardiac adverse events 
indicative of cardiomyopathy or for patients with a LVEF 
that decreases below the LLN (assessed as either an 
absolute decrease of LVEF of ≥15% or <LLN with an 
absolute decrease of ≥5%), trabectedin should be 
discontinued.”

Rare cases of hepatic failure (including cases with fatal 
outcomes) have been reported in patients with serious 
underlying medical conditions treated with trabectedin, 
both in clinical trials and in post marketing setting. Some 
potential risk factors that may have contributed to 
increased trabectedin toxicity observed in these cases were 
dose management inconsistent with recommended 
guidelines, potential CYP3A4 interaction due to multiple 
competing CYP3A4 substrates or CYP3A4 inhibitors, or lack 
of dexamethasone prophylaxis. 
During clinical trials, hypersensitivity was reported in 2% of 
patients receiving trabectedin either alone or in 
combination with PLD, and most of these cases were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity.  
During post marketing experience, hypersensitivity 
reactions with very rare occurrence of fatal outcome, have 
been reported in association with trabectedin 
administration either alone or in combination with PLD. 
Cases of septic shock, some of which were fatal, have been 
uncommonly reported in clinical studies and postmarketing 
experience, in patients treated either with monotherapy or

Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of Yondelis continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and considers that the benefit/risk profile of 
this medicinal product continues to be favourable. The 
CHMP recommends the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Yondelis, subject to the conditions and 
obligations as laid down in Annex II to the Opinion. The 
CHMP recommends that the renewal be granted with 
unlimited validity. The MAH is requested to submit yearly 
PSURs unless otherwise specified by the CHMP.  
Additional data on the investigation to elucidate whether 
predictors of response to Yondelis in patients with soft 
tissue sarcoma can be identified (SOB 001) is awaited.

The MAH proposed the update of section 5.1 of the

trabectedin on the QT/QTc interval duration measured by 
II, Labelling 
and was conducted to assess the potential effects of 
SmPC in order to add a statement regarding the 
absence of effect of trabectedin on QTc interval 
following the results of a QT/QTc study and to update 
the overall survival data from the pivotal trial ET743-
OVA-301 in the indication of ovarian cancer with the 
final results as requested by the CHMP within the 
Follow up measure FUM 019. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) in subjects with advanced solid 
tumor malignancies when administered at a therapeutic 
dose of 1.3 mg/m2.  
This study showed that trabectedin did not prolong the QTc 
interval as measured by ECGs in subjects with advanced 
solid tumor malignancies when administered at a 
therapeutic dose. The results of this study meet the criteria 
for a negative QT/QTc study.

similar to that observed in previous studies. No adverse

The final overall survival (OS) data from the pivotal trial 
ET743-OVA-301 were requested by the CHMP as a Follow 
Up Measure 019 to a Type II variation for a new indication 
to use Yondelis in the treatment of patients with relapsed 
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  
The updated OS analysis, including 522 events, continues 
to show a positive trend towards improved survival in the 
Yondelis + PLD compared to PLD, though this did not reach 
statistical significance with a hazard ratio of 0.086 and a p-
value of 0.0835. When OS analysis was adjusted for pre-
specified co-variates and using platinum-free interval as a 
continuum, the improvement in survival was significant 
with a Hazard ratio of 0.082 and a p-value of 0.0285.

product, concluded that the benefit/risk balance for the 
product remains favourable.

SmPC and PL 
The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations submitted by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder and having re-assessed the 
benefit/risk profile of Yondelis, recommended that 
amendments of Annexes I, II and IIIB of the Commission 
Decision are necessary. 
Further to the review of the post-marketing data during the 
preparation of this annual re-assessment application, the

Marketing Authorisation Holder proposed to strengthen the 
current wording on severe local infusion reactions in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and the Package Leaflet 
and to include the medicinal product aprepitant in the list of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, which could potentially interact with 
trabectedin. The proposed changes were acceptable to the 
CHMP. 
Since there is still a specific obligation which needs to be 
fulfilled, the CHMP recommended that the marketing 
authorization of Yondelis remains under exceptional 
circumstances.

modify the instructions for handling and administration of 
Yondelis.  
This change is related to the reduction of volume (from 
500ml to 50ml) of diluent in which the reconstituted 
solution is diluted for administration through a central 
venous line, and consequently  to limit the nominal 
concentration of trabectedin infusion solution to 30µg/ml.  
In addition, the MAH wants to add Polyisoprene reservoirs 
and Type I glass bottles as compatible packaging materials 
with Yondelis diluted solutions.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
BRUKINSA  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
refractory or relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. 
Epidemiology  
FL is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), comprising 20% to 30% of all 
NHL diagnoses in developed countries (Cerhan 2020). While there is considerable heterogeneity in the 
clinical course of FL, it is generally an indolent malignancy, with a prolonged but incurable clinical course. 
The incidence of FL appears to be increasing, with a documented increase of 0.5 cases per million persons 
per year between 1992 and 2010. In the EU, the annual incidence of this disease has rapidly increased 
during recent decades and has risen from 2 to 3 per 100,000 persons during the 1950s to 5 per 100,000 
recently. The reported median age at diagnosis for FL in EU is 64.9 years (Casulo et al 2015).  
Follicular  lymphoma  is  defined  as  a  lymphoma  of  germinal  center  B  cells,  and  virtually  always 
demonstrates a growth pattern that is partially follicular.  
With modern treatment approaches for FL, median survival exceeds 10 years (Casulo et al 2015). Over 
the past several decades, the incorporation of novel active agents into treatment practices has resulted 
in a decline in FL mortality trends (Howlader et al 2016). Yet, FL remains incurable. Its clinical history is 
typically one of multiple relapses, with successive treatment regimens resulting in progressively shorter 
disease-control intervals, until fatal, resistant disease emerges. In addition to the morbidity and mortality 
associated  with 
treatment 
resistance, 
cumulative 
treatment-related 
toxicity 
(especially 
immunosuppression,  myelosuppression,  and  secondary  leukaemia  related  to  alkylator  exposure)  and 
transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain significant contributors to mortality in 
patients with FL.  
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  molecular  pathogenesis  of  FL  is  a  complex  process  involving  several  steps  during  which  a  single 
follicular B cell acquires all of the genetic and epigenetic alterations needed for malignant transformation. 
The resultant tumour is usually comprised of a mixture of centrocytes (small cleaved germinal center 
cells) and centroblasts (large noncleaved germinal center cells). Some common steps in this pathway 
have  been  described,  particularly  chromosomal  rearrangements  involving  BCL-2  and  certain  somatic 
mutations, some of which are also seen in other non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In most cases, FL is associated 
with a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 18, the site of the BCL-2 oncogene, and one 
of the three immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. The most common translocation involves the Ig heavy chain 
gene resulting in the t(14;18)(q32;q21), found in approximately 85 percent of FL. BCL-2 overexpression 
in itself is not sufficient for FL development and other genetic lesions or host factors are required. Some 
of  the  complementary  mutations  involve  genes  that  regulate  the  epigenome  (for  example  histone 
modifications, chromatin structure). Other important factors involve the local host response and tumour

microenvironment, and modifications in the B cell receptor that may augment B cell receptor signalling. 
The tumour cells express monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, CD20 (or CD19), CD10,and BCL-6 and 
are negative for CD5 and CD23 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Initially, patients with FL usually present with painless peripheral adenopathy, often with a long history 
of waxing and waning lymph node enlargement. Widespread disseminated disease is usually present at 
baseline,  but  patients  are  typically  asymptomatic  aside  from  their  lymphadenopathy.  There  are  no 
characteristic laboratory abnormalities and, despite the large tumour burden, the majority has a normal 
serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. 
After initial therapy, patients are  followed  at routine intervals to monitor for relapse or complications 
related  to  treatment.  On  suspicion  of  relapse  it  is  important  to  rule  out  transformation  to  a  more 
aggressive histologic subtype, most commonly diffuse large B cell lymphoma (NOS). Follicular lymphoma 
grade 3b and transformed FL generally requires a more intensive treatment approach than FL grade 1-
3a.   
Management 
Significant progress has been made with the introduction of newer targeted agents in R/R FL. However, 
these new treatments are often associated with significant toxicities and none of them provide long-term 
disease control, particularly in patients who had received multiple lines of therapy and/or who are highly 
refractory (Dreyling et al 2021). 
Rituximab  (MabThera)  is  an  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody,  approved  in  1998  for  the  treatment  of 
patients with R/R FL. The efficacy and safety of rituximab monotherapy in patients with R/R FL has been 
recently evaluated in the CHRONOS-3 trial as a comparator to the copanlisib plus rituximab arm. In this 
study, 91 patients with R/R FL were randomized in the rituximab plus placebo arm. The overall response 
rate was 54% (95% CI: 43%, 4%), the complete response rate was 21%, and the median progression-
free survival was 18.7 months (95% CI: 5.5, 27.9 months).  
Idelalisib (Zydelig), a selective inhibitor of the PI3K-δ isoform, received EU authorization as monotherapy 
for the treatment of adult patients with FL that is refractory to 2 prior lines of treatment in 2014. The 
approval was based on complete response and partial response results from a Phase II single arm study 
on patients with previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) (including 72 patients with 
FL) that was refractory both to rituximab and to alkylating agent-containing chemotherapy. In the pivotal 
study, 125 patients were enrolled, including 72 with FL. The overall response rate (FL population) was 
55.6% and the complete response rate was 16.7% (Gopal et al 2014; Wagner-Johnston et al 2021). The 
median duration of response was 11.8 months (95% CI: 6.2, 26.9 months)  and the median PFS  was 
11.0 months (95% CI: 8.0, 14.0 months). Common Grade 3 to 4 treatment-emergent adverse events 
were neutropenia, diarrhea, and pneumonia. There are, however, significant safety concerns associated 
with the use of idelalisib and the FL indication was voluntarily withdrawn from the US in January 2022 
(Gilead statement 2022). 
Obinutuzumab (Gazyva; Gazyvaro) is a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody that was engineered to 
have a higher affinity for the CD20 receptor and to cause enhanced direct target-cell killing compared 
with  rituximab.  Obinutuzumab  was  approved  in  2016  in  combination  with  bendamustine  followed  by 
monotherapy for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who relapsed after, or are refractory 
to, a rituximab-containing regimen. The approval is based on the progression-free survival results of a

Phase III study comparing treatment with obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine, followed by 
obinutuzumab alone as maintenance therapy, to bendamustine alone in patients with FL not responding 
to  rituximab.  The  GADOLIN  Study  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  randomized  Phase  3  study  of  396 
subjects  with  indolent  NHL  refractory  to  rituximab  (Sehn  et  al  2016);  321  had  R/R  FL  and  were 
randomised  to  receive  either  bendamustine  alone  or  obinutuzumab  plus  bendamustine  followed  by  2 
years of maintenance with obinutuzumab. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in 
the  obinutuzumab-bendamustine  arm  (25.8  months;  95%  CI:  19.5,  41.1 months)  than  in  the 
bendamustine arm (14.1 months; 95% CI: 12.6, 16.0 months); a treatment benefit was also seen for 
overall survival (Cheson et al 2018). 
Recently, new drugs  have been approved  for patients with R/R FL,  which expands the possibilities of 
treatment for second-line therapy.  
This includes combination of lenalidomide (Revlimid) plus rituximab (Leonard et al 2019) approved in 
2019. The combination of lenalidomide plus rituximab is indicated for patients who have relapsed or did 
not respond to previous treatment (Leonard et al 2019). In this study, 358 patients with R/R FL or R/R 
MZL  were  randomly  assigned  to  lenalidomide  plus  rituximab  (n = 178,  147  patients  with  R/R  FL)  or 
placebo plus rituximab (n = 180, 148 patients with R/R FL). The primary endpoint was progression-free 
survival assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). For the patients with R/R FL, the median 
progression-free  survival  assessed  by  the  IRC  was  39.4  months  (95%  CI:  23.1 months,  not  reached 
[NR]) with lenalidomide plus rituximab versus 13.9 months (95% CI: 11.2, 16.0 months) with placebo 
plus rituximab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.56; p < 0.0001). The median progression-free 
survival assessed by investigators (R/R FL  population)  was 27.8 months (95% CI: 22.1 months, NR) 
with lenalidomide plus rituximab. The data with a median follow-up of 28.3 months were not mature to 
demonstrate  overall  survival  benefit.  Neutropenia  (including  50%  of  patients  with  Grades  3  to  4), 
gastrointestinal  toxicity,  cutaneous  reactions,  and  infections  were  the  most  common  side  effects 
associated with the combination. 
In 2021, duvelisib (Copiktra), another PI3K inhibitor was approved for patients with FL not responding 
to two previous treatments. The pivotal study  in FL  is a Phase  2, open-label, single arm efficacy  and 
safety study of duvelisib monotherapy administered orally to subjects with R/R indolent NHL, including 
the subtypes of FL (n = 83), SLL (n = 28), and MZL (n = 18) for a total of 129 subjects. This study was 
designed to evaluate the effect of duvelisib 25 mg twice daily monotherapy in subjects with indolent NHL 
refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy. The overall response rate 
was 42.2% (FL patients); median duration of response (all population) was 10 months (95% CI: 6.5, 
10.5 months). The R/R FL indication was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in December 2021 
(US FDA Notification 2022).   
In  2022,  mosunetuzumab  (Lunsumio),  a  CD20  x  CD3  T-cell  bispecific  antibody  (Budde  et  al  2022) 
received conditional marketing authorization in EU for R/R FL. The pivotal study enrolled 90 patients with 
R/R FL, and the median study follow-up was 18.3 months. Overall response rate by IRC assessment was 
80.0%  (95%  CI:  70.3%,  87.7%),  and  the  complete  response  rate  was  60.0%.  Median  duration  of 
response was 22.8 months (95% CI: 9.7 months, NR) and median progression-free survival was 17.9 
months (95% CI: 10.1 months, NR). 
Finally, other recently approved treatments for R/R FL are two CD19 CAR-T cell products, axicabtagene 
ciloleulel, and tisagenlecleucel (Fowler et al 2021; Jacobson et al 2022). 
Currently approved therapies in EU for R/R FL are summarized below.

Acceptable options for patients with R/R FL remain somewhat limited and may not be useful for many 
patients,  whether  because  of  advanced  patient  age  (precluding  use  of  stem  cell  transplantation, 
chemotherapy,  or  cellular  therapy)  or  limited  bone  marrow  reserve  following  prior  therapies 
(radioimmunotherapy) (Dreyling et al 2021 ESMO). Thus, treatments capable of inducing high rates of 
durable  responses  with  favorable  safety  and  tolerability  profiles  are  still  needed  in  the  high-risk 
population of patients with R/R FL, especially in second or greater relapse. 
BTK  inhibitors  as  monotherapy  have  been  shown  to  be  very  effective  in  the  treatment  of  B-cell 
malignancies such as CLL. Unfortunately, in FL, the first generation BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, has been 
disappointing due to low response rates (Bartlett et al 2018; Gopal et al 2018). In contrast, the second 
generation BTK inhibitor, zanubrutinib, showed initial efficacy as monotherapy in early studies enrolling 
a  variety  of  B-cell  lymphomas,  including  those  with  R/R  FL.  Results  of  Study  BGB-3111-212,  which 
provide  pivotal  study  data  for  this  application  in  FL,  showed  that  the  efficacy  of  zanubrutinib  as 
monotherapy can be markedly enhanced by the addition of obinutuzumab. This combination was shown 
to be efficacious in high-risk patient populations, and the safety profile is such that it can be administered 
to patients who are not chemotherapy candidates. As a consequence, the combination of zanubrutinib 
plus obinutuzumab could expand treatment options and further address the substantial unmet need of 
the R/R FL population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Brukinsa  (zanubrutinib)  is  a  BTK  inhibitor,  which  is  a  member  of  the  tyrosine  kinase  expressed  in 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  (TEC)  family  of  kinases,  many  of  which  are  abundantly  expressed  in 
hematopoietic tissues and play key roles in the growth and differentiation processes of hematopoietic 
cells. BTK plays a critical role in B-cell receptor signalling, which mediates B-cell growth, proliferation, 
migration, and adhesion. Constitutive activation of B-cell receptor signalling is critical for cell survival 
and clonal expansion in B-cell malignancies, and  BTK has been validated as a therapeutic target in a 
variety of B-cell malignancies. FL harbours recurrent cell-intrinsic genetic changes, including mutations

in genes involved in the B-cell receptor signalling pathway (Singh et al 2018) including BTK (Krysiak et 
al 2017). This supports a role in lymphomagenesis and, therefore, a role for BTK inhibition for patients 
with R/R FL.  
Given these features, inhibition of BTK with zanubrutinib is an attractive approach for patients with R/R 
FL, particularly when used in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Key points from the Scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/3376/3/2017/II) (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/669794/2017) 
include:  
•  Determination of ORR by independent central review using the Lugano Classification for NHL 
(Cheson 2014) is acceptable. Of note, patients with no response to obinutuzumab after 12 
months will receive BGB-311 in addition to obinutuzumab. The benefit of this approach is 
largely hypothetical and such an option will confound longer-term assessment of endpoints. 
The CHMP does not recommend cross-over. During the discussion meeting the Applicant 
discussed the option of offering cross-over at progression. This would at least preserve 
assessment of PFS.  
• 
Proposed size and design in the relevant population would not automatically establish a 
compelling clinical benefit.  
The scientific advice has been overall adhered to, except for advice given regarding crossover in the 
study 212.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided the variation report from the EMEA/H/C/004978/II/0010 procedure in which the 
full environmental risk assessment for zanubrutinib for the treatment of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 
was updated including PECSURFACEWATER.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the given DT50 values for the parent, zanubrutinib itself is considered not persistent, 
however the transformation products  TP-1 and TP-3 have to be considered persistent as both remain 
stable or even increase over the test period, respectively.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of zanubrutinib.

This is a summary of the updated clinical pharmacology results since the initial MAA  including: 
• 
Non-compartmental  analysis  based  on  intensive  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data  from  study  BGB-
3111-GA101 (Day 1, N=12; steady state, N=111) to assess zanubrutinib PK after administration 
of 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily in combination with obinutuzumab (CSR). 
• 
An updated population PK analysis (N=248) incorporating PK data from studies BGB-3111-GA101 
and  BGB-3111-212  based  on  the  population  PK  model  previously  developed  (N=1291).  The 
external model validation approach was used to evaluate the PK characteristics of zanubrutinib in

Studies BGB-3111-GA101 and BGB-3111-212 
Title of Studies 
Study BGB-3111-GA101: A Phase 1b Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Antitumor Activity of the 
Combination of BGB-3111 with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies. 
Study BGB-3111-212: An International, Phase 2, Open-Label, Randomized Study of BGB-3111 Combined 
With  Obinutuzumab  Compared  With  Obinutuzumab  Monotherapy  in  Relapsed/Refractory  Follicular 
Lymphoma. 
Study  GA101  was  a  2-part,  uncontrolled  phase  1b  study,  in  which  zanubrutinib  in  combination  with 
obinutuzumab was investigated patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies including FL. Study GA101 
included a safety evaluation (Part 1) for selecting recommended phase 2 doses in subsequent indication-
specific expansion cohorts (Part 2). The pivotal phase 2 study 212 enrolled only patients with relapsed-
refractory  FL,  who  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  manner  to  zanubrutinib  +  obinutizumab  (Arm  A)  or 
obinutuzumab monotherapy (Arm B). (See Clinical efficacy section).  
Study drug administration 
Study GA101:  
Zanubrutinib was administered orally either 320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily. Obinutuzumab 
was administered intravenously at a final concentration of 0.4 to 4 mg/mL for up to 6 cycles at doses 
consistent with the US prescribing information: 
Part 1: 
• Day 2 Cycle 1: 100 mg obinutuzumab 
• Day 3 Cycle 1: 900 mg obinutuzumab 
• Day 9 and Day 16 Cycle 1: 1000 mg obinutuzumab 
• Day 1 Cycles 2 to 6: 1000 mg obinutuzumab 
Part 2: 
• Day 1 Cycle 1: 100 mg obinutuzumab 
• Day 2 Cycle 1: 900 mg obinutuzumab 
• Day 8 and Day 15 Cycle 1: 1000 mg Obinutuzumab 
• Day 1 Cycles 2 to 6: 1000 mg obinutuzumab 
In Part 1, Cycle 1 was 29 days and Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter was 28 days. In Part 2, all cycles 
were 28 days. 
Study 212: 
Zanubrutinib was administered 160 mg twice daily with or without food. Obinutuzumab (1000 mg) was 
administered intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1; on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; and then every 
8 weeks. At the discretion of the investigator, obinutuzumab may have been administered intravenously 
on Day 1 (100 mg) and on Day 2 (900 mg) of Cycle 1 instead of 1000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Responding 
patients may have continued to receive maintenance obinutuzumab every 8 weeks for an additional 24

months (eg, maximum total duration of obinutuzumab  of approximately 30 months [maximum of 20 
doses]). 
Sampling 
Study GA101: 
Blood samples were collected to evaluate the PK profiles of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab. For intensive 
PK profiling, blood samples for zanubrutinib were collected from up to 15 patients on Cycle 1 Day 1 (Part 
1 only) at predose and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 hours postdose; on Cycle 1 Day 2 (Part 1 only) at predose; and 
on Cycle 2 Day 1 at predose and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 hours postdose. 
The PK profile for obinutuzumab in Part 1 was determined by serum concentrations on Cycle 1 Day 2, 
Cycle 1 Day 3, Cycle 1 Day 9, Cycle 1 Day 16, and Day 1 on Cycles 2, 4, and 6 measured before the 
start of the infusion and at 4 hours (end of infusion). In Part 2, the obinutuzumab serum concentrations 
were  measured  on  Day  1  of  Cycles  4  and  6  before  the  start  of  the  infusion  and  at  4  hours  (end  of 
infusion). 
Study 212: 
Blood samples were collected from patients in Arm A (zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab) to assess plasma 
zanubrutinib  concentrations.  Sparse  PK  samples  were  collected  at  the  following  timepoints:  predose 
(within 30 min prior to zanubrutinib dose), and 2 hours (± 30 min) post-zanubrutinib dose on Cycle 1 
Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1. 
Bioanalytical methods and analyses 
All  bioanalytical  methods  for  zanubrutinib  PK  analyses  were  based  on  high-performance  liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These methods were fully validated. 
Pop PK analyses 
Assembly of the PK dataset as performed using SAS or R software by Shanghai Qiangshi Information 
Technology Co., Ltd. (SHQS) as Microsoft Excel format (.csv) for input into NONMEM. Model parameter 
estimation and model evaluation were implemented with NONMEM 7, version 7.4.3; PopPK estimation 
was performed using the FOCEI method in NONMEM.

A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model for zanubrutinib has been previously developed based on 
data  from  11  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  B-cell 
malignancies. The previous model was structured with two-compartments, with sequential zero-order

and  first-order  absorption  as  well  as  first-order  elimination  from  the  central  compartment  and 
redistribution from the peripheral compartment. The previous final zanubrutinib PopPK model was used 
to obtain empirical Bayes estimates of individual PK parameters of all zanubrutinib treated subjects from 
studies  BGB-3111-GA101  and  BGB-3111-212  by  external  validation.  Study  GA101  included  rich  and 
sparse data from patients with various B-cell lymphoma (N=119 patients enrolled of which 36 had FL), 
and two dose regimens of zanubrutinib (320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice daily) in combination with 
obinutuzumab were evaluated. Study 212 included sparse data from patients with FL (N=145 patients 
enrolled). BLQ observations were omitted (n=205). Outliers (n=27) and switched peak/trough samples 
(n=10) were also removed. A total of 94 (10.3%) data points were excluded from calculation of bias. 
The final external model validation dataset was comprised of 248 subjects with B-cell lymphoma that 
included 171 FL patients with 910 zanubrutinib concentration-time data points.

subjects in the validation dataset were obtained by fixing the parameters in the structural and variance 
model to the parameter estimates in the final model using post-hoc Bayesian forecasting with NONMEM

The impact of existing covariates of ALT and age on model predicted steady state exposures (AUCss, 
Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss)  was  further  quantified  by  calculating  the  difference  in  geometric  mean  of 
exposures at the lowest or highest quartile of covariate distribution from that of the overall population. 
The impact of baseline ALT and age on zanubrutinib exposure was relatively small (-7.24% to 24.2% for 
ALT and -9.37% to +15.1% for age).

Assembly  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  dataset  was  performed  using  R  software  by  SHQS.  For  binary 
response  variables,  boxplots  of  exposures  stratified  by  responses  were  generated.  The  probability  of 
response  was calculated and plotted versus exposure metrics  (AUC0-24,ss,  Cmax,ss and  Cmin,ss) or 
covariates  of  interest,  after  binning  patients  according  to  quantiles  of  exposure  metrics  or  covariate 
values.  If  an  E-R  trend  was  observed,  further  analysis  with  linear  logistic  regression  models  were 
performed. 
Data collected of the primary endpoint ORR by IRC in patients with FL from study BGB-3111-212 were

Plots of mean plasma zanubrutinib concentration-time profiles on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 are

of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) (coefficient of variation of geometric mean [%GCV]) 
at 360.4 (90.4%) ng/mL and 589.4 (79.9%) ng/mL after the administration of single doses of 160 and 
320 mg, respectively. The median time to reach Cmax (tmax) was 2.0 and 1.4 hours in the 160 mg and

320 mg dose groups, respectively. The estimated area under the plasma concentration time curve from 
0  to  last  measurable  concentration  (AUC0-last)  was  1123.6  (71.5%)  ng•h/mL  and  2179.5  (70.2%) 
ng•h/mL after the administration of single 160 and 320 mg doses, respectively. The estimated geometric 
mean of steady state AUC0-last  was 1074.1 (42.1%)  ng•h/mL  and 2003.9 (42.6%)  ng•h/mL  after the 
administration of multiple 160 and 320 mg doses, respectively, in the presence of obinutuzumab. 
The interpatient variability (measured as % GCV) was 79.9% to 90.4% for Cmax and 70.2% to 71.5% 
for AUC0-last after a single dose. The variability dropped at steady state after multiple doses as the sample 
size increased. The % GCV was 42.6% to 52.3% for steady state Cmax and 42.1% to 42.6% for steady 
state  AUC0-last.  Considering  the  variability,  zanubrutinib  single-dose  exposure  was  consistent  with  the 
exposure observed in other studies (Study BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-3111-CP-006 PK Report: single-dose 
AUC0-last was 1132 [61.1%] ng•h/mL for 160 mg [N = 76] and 2281 [60.5%] ng•h/mL for 320 mg (N = 
19). The steady state plasma exposures of zanubrutinib after the admini-stration of 160 mg twice daily 
and 320 mg once daily were also consistent with those in other studies of zanubrutinib monotherapy 
(Study BGB-3111-AU-003 CSR, BGB-3111-CP-006 PK Report: multiple-dose AUC0-last was 994.4 [43.6%] 
ng•h/mL for 160 mg [N = 60] and 1706 [54.2%] ng•h/mL for 320 mg [N = 28]). The results indicated 
that obinutuzumab had minimal impact on zanubrutinib exposure.

No new information has been submitted in this application.

Please refer to Population PK analyses section above 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Zanubrutinib is a BTK inhibitor approved in the EU as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line 
treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy; marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have 
received  at  least  one  prior  anti-CD20-based  therapy  and  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (CLL).  The 
current type II variation submission concerns approval of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab 
for treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received 
at  least  two  prior  systemic  therapies.  The  pharmacology  package  included  in  the  present  application 
includes data from a Phase 1b, 2-part open-label study of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab in patients 
with  R/R  disease  of  various  B-cell  lymphoid  malignancies  including  FL  (study  GA101)  and  a  phase  2 
study in which R/R FL patients were randomized to obinutuzumab alone or combined with zanubrutinib 
(study 212).  
The bioanalyses conducted in studies BGB-3111-GA101 (Study GA101) and BGB-3111-212 (Study 212) 
included  determination  of  zanubrutinib  and  obinutuzumab  concentrations.  The  applied  LC-MS/MS 
methods for determination of zanubrutinib  and  the  ELISA method for determination of  obinutuzumab 
were not evaluated. 
The previous final Pop PK model based on data from HV and patients with B-cell malignancies following 
zanubrutinib monotherapy, was used to fit the concentration data from Studies GA101 and 212 where 
zanubrutinib  was  administered  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab.  Data  from  171  FL  patients  were 
included  in  the  pooled  patient  population  which  also  included  data  from  patients  with  other  B-cell 
malignancies.  GA101  included  rich  and  sparse  sampled  PK  data,  while  PK  data  from  study  212  was 
sparse. The external fit by the previous model without re-estimation of model parameters, indicate the 
PK  of  zanubrutinib  in  FL  patients  is  comparable  to  patients  with  other  B-cell  malignancies  and  that 
combination  with  obinutuzumab  does  not  affect  zanubrutinib  PK.  In  line,  colour-coded  zanubrutinib 
concentration-time profiles based on rich PK data from study GA101 indicate that the exposure profile 
in  patients  with  FL  overlaps  with  those  observed  in  subjects  with  other  types  of  B-cell  lymphoid 
malignancies. 
The exposure-efficacy evaluation of ORR was based on data from Study 212. No relation to exposure 
measures at steady-state, AUC0-24, Cmax or Cmin was detected by logistic regression modelling. For 
safety evaluation, data from GA101 and 212 were pooled. No  response plots indicated any relation of 
investigated safety issue to exposure. No exposure-safety relations were further investigated by linear 
logistic regression models as no trends were observed. 
FL  patients  from  Studies  212  and  GA-101  all  received  concomitant  treatment  with  obinutuzumab, 
however the treatment schedules after 6 months of treatment were not similar in the two studies. Since 
the individual PK parameter shrinkage values have not been reported for the current PK data, it is not 
known  how  well informed the exposure metrics were for the exposure-response  and  exposure-safety 
analyses. Nonetheless, even if the shrinkage values had been known, the overall conclusion of lack of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 38/133 
 
 
 
 
exposure-response-relationships  would  remain  unchanged.  Consequently,  the  issue  of  non-reported 
shrinkage values is not pursued. 
The different obinituzumab treatments did not seem to influence zanubrutinib exposure, however, is not 
possible to distinguish between the two regarding safety issues since the safety data were pooled across 
the two studies. However, no relation of any investigated safety issue to exposure was shown in response 
plots;  hence,  this  issue  will  not be  further  pursued  as  regards  exposure-response  for  safety.  Besides 
grade  ≥3  neutropenia,  exposure-safety  relations  between  AUC0-24h,ss  Cmax,ss  and  Cmin,ss  versus  the 
following AEs of interest were investigated: Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, grade ≥3 anemia, grade ≥3 
infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and 
flutter, and major bleeding events. The figures have been assessed but have not been copied to this AR 
for sake of brevity. No exposure-safety relations were further investigated by linear logistic regression 
models as no trends were observed. 
Overall, and in accordance with previous zanubrutinib submissions, no significant E/R relationsships were 
observed for ORR or any of the safety endpoints studied. Again, E/R analyses are limited by PK data at 
only one total daily dose level (320 mg) and by small number of certain events (e.g. n=4 for all events 
of atrial fibrillation and flutter).   
Considering  the  variability,  zanubrutinib  exposures  in  Study  GA101  following  both  single-dose 
administration of zanubrutinib 160 mg or 320 mg (Part 1) and multiple doses at 160 mg BID or 320 mg 
once daily (Parts 1 and 2) were consistent with those observed in prior patients with B-cell malignancies 
treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy - this as per the above referenced PK results from Study BGB-
3111-AU-003 submitted with the initial EU MAA in WM. The high variability observed after single dose 
administration might be due to small number of patients (N=6). In the beginning of the Part 1 of the 
study, single dose zanubrutinib was given alone on Day1 of Cycle 1 before Obinutuzumab was started 
on Day 2. The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib could be sufficiently interpreted based on 
the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  after  single  dose.  Zanubrutinib  possess  time-dependency  in 
pharmacokinetics inducing its own metabolism through CYP3A, which could be observed here as slightly 
lower exposure at steady state compared to single dose PK.  
The obinutuzumab concentration-time course data from study GA101 was likewise consistent with that 
previously reported in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: Based on the Gazyvaro SmPC, after the 
Cycle 6 Day 1 infusion in iNHL patients the population PK model predicted median Cmax value was 539.3 
μg/mL which is in good agreement with the observed Cmax (geometric mean 577.15 µg/ml, CV% 43.52%) 
for  Obinutuzumab  on  Cycle  6  of  the  current  study.  These  cross-study  comparisons  indicate  that 
obinutuzumab had no observable impact on zanubrutinib exposure and vice versa. This is as would be 
expected  for  a  CD-20  monoclonal  antibody  (Gayzyvaro  EPAR).  Exposure  parameters  (AUC)  were  not 
determined for obinutuzumab. 
The  MAH  submitted  colour-coded  zanubrutinib  concentration-time  profiles  based  on  rich  PK  data  for 
patients  with  FL  vs.  subjects  within  the  other  four  disease-specific  cohorts  combined  in  study  GA101 
(‘spaghetti plots’) for confirmation that PK is comparable in patients with FL compared to in those with 
other B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Based on the provided figures, the zanubrutinib concentration-time 
course profile does not appear affected by diagnosis (type of specific B-cell lymphoid malignancy).  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology data submitted support the extension of the indication in FL. The population PK 
model and the exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib support the 
Assessment report

proposed dose, however keeping in mind that the exposure-response analyses are based on data at 
only one total daily dose level (320 mg). Based on PK data submitted with the current extension of 
indication and with the initial (WM) EU MAA, the two proposed zanubrutinib dose regimens, 160 mg 
twice daily and 320 mg once daily, were found to provide comparable exposure (AUC), and the same 
posology for the FL indication is considered acceptable based on the efficacy, safety and PK. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The proposed dose regimen in patients with FL is a 320 mg total daily dose (administered as 160 mg 
twice  daily  or  320  mg  once  daily).  This  is  based  on  the  totality  of  safety,  efficacy,  PK,  and 
pharmacodynamics  (BTK  occupancy  data)  results  from  studies BGB-3111-AU-003,  BGB-3111-1002, 
BGB-3111-GA101, and BGB-3111-212. 
In Study BGB-3111-AU-003 at dose regimens of 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice 
daily, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed during 
the dose-escalation part of the study. Moreover, nearly full occupancy of BTK was achieved in peripheral 
blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  of  patients  at  all  administered  doses,  and  in  lymph  node  tissue  at 
160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily (BGB-3111-AU-003 Clinical Study Report). Activity has been 
observed across various B-cell malignancies (including CLL, MCL, WM, and FL) at all tested dose levels. 
Numerically comparable ORRs have also been observed between the 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg 
once daily regimens in patients with MCL, WM, and FL (Tam et al 2021; Report BGB-3111-CP-012).  
Although the number of FL patients treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy at 320 mg once daily (N = 9) 
is limited relative to those at 160 mg twice daily dose (N = 50) in BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-
1002, numerically comparable ORR have been observed between 160 mg twice  daily (ORR 33.3% in 
BGB-3111-AU-003 and 43.5% in BGB-3111-1002) and 320 mg once daily (ORR 50.0% in BGB-3111-
AU-003  and  66.7%  in  BGB-3111-1002)  in  FL  patients  (Report  BGB-3111-CP-012).  Furthermore,  no 
remarkable differences in adverse events between the two regimens in the safety population in Study 
BGB-3111-AU-003 were observed (Ou et al 2021). 
Based on zanubrutinib monotherapy data in R/R FL, the combination of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab 
was  tested  in  Phase  1b  study  BGB-3111-GA101,  a  proof-of-concept  study.  The  steady-state  plasma 
exposures of zanubrutinib after administration of 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily were also 
consistent with those in other studies of zanubrutinib monotherapy results, indicating that obinutuzumab 
had  minimal  impact  on  zanubrutinib  exposure.  As  with  monotherapy,  comparable  ORRs  and  safety 
profiles were observed in patients with B-cell lymphoma following the two dose regimens (Report BGB-
3111-CP-012  and  Table  14.3.1.2.6.2  of  BGB-3111-GA-101  Clinical  Study  Report).  Intravenous 
administration of multiple doses of obinutuzumab was delivered to patients according  to the package 
insert  (Gazyva  [obinutuzumab]  US  prescribing  information  2021).  Obinutuzumab  exposure  nearly 
reached  steady  state  15  days  after  the  first  infusion.  The  mean  steady-state  obinutuzumab  Ctrough 
levels during Cycles 2 to 6 were 292 to 370 µg/mL, and the serum concentration at 4 hours after infusion 
(Cmax) was 618 to 652 µg/mL during Cycles 2 to 6. These data are consistent with the published data 
for  obinutuzumab  monotherapy  in  patients  with  B-cell  lymphoma  (Gibiansky  et  al  2014),  indicating 
zanubrutinib  had  minimum  impact  on  obinutuzumab  PK.  Comparable  ORRs  and  safety  profiles  were 
observed in patients with B-cell lymphoma following the two dose regimens (Report BGB-3111-CP-012 
and Table 14.3.1.2.6.2 of BGB-3111-GA-101 Clinical Study Report). In addition, comparable ORR in FL 
patients have been observed between 160 mg twice daily (CR 45%; ORR 75%, N = 20) and 320 mg 
once daily (CR 43.8%, ORR 68.8%, N = 16) (Report BGB-3111-CP-012). Furthermore, zanubrutinib with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 40/133 
 
 
 
 
160  mg  twice  daily  dose  in  concomitant  use  with  obinutuzumab  in  BGB-3111-212  provided  strong 
evidence of efficacy in patients with R/R FL (CR 39.3%; ORR 69.0%, N = 145, BGB-3111-212 Clinical 
Study Report). 
Additional data support a 320 mg once daily regimen as an option in addition to the 160 mg twice daily 
regimen for patients with FL. Given the same total daily dose (320 mg) and linear PK, similar AUCs are 
achieved between the 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice daily dose. At the 320 mg once daily dose, 
a  sustained  and  profound  BTK  inhibition  in  PBMC  and  lymph  node  tissue  were  also  observed.  The 
exposure-response  (E-R)  analyses  indicated  that  there  was  no  evident  E-R  relationship  between 
exposure (AUC0-24, Cmax, or Cmin) and safety endpoints (adverse events of interest) in patients with 
B-cell  malignancies  (Report  BGB-3111-CP-011)  and  in  patients  with  FL  (Report  BGB-3111-CP-012). 
There  were  no  significant  relationships  between  zanubrutinib  exposure  and  adverse  events  including 
cytopenia, infections, and bleeding. In addition, the available E-R analysis in patients with FL (Module 
2.7.2, Section 3.2 and Report BGB-3111-CP-012) and other B-cell malignancies including MCL (Report 
BGB-3111-CP-003),  WM  (Report  BGB-3111-CP-007),  MZL  (Report  BGB-3111-CP-009)  and  CLL/SLL 
(Report BGB-3111-CP-0011) indicated that efficacy (ORR) does not appear to be significantly impacted 
by Cmax or Cmin, and therefore the AUC delivered by a 320 mg once daily regimen is expected to result 
in a similar ORR as that of the 160 mg twice daily regimen. 
The totality of the data summarized support the recommended dose of a 320 mg total daily dose (as 
160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily) in combination with obinutuzumab in adult patients with FL. 
This is based on consistent and sustained BTK occupancy in PBMCs and target tissue, high rates of overall 
response  and  complete  response  in  patients  with  FL  in  the  pivotal  study,  BGB-3111-212,  and  a 
favourable safety and tolerability profile.

Treatments 
Zanubrutinib was administered as two 80-mg capsules orally twice a day (160 mg twice a day) with or 
without food. Patients received daily treatment with zanubrutinib until disease progression, intolerance 
or death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by sponsor. Each treatment cycle 
was 28 days. 
For both arms obinutuzumab (1000 mg) was administered intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 
1;  on  Day  1  of  Cycles  2  to  6;  and  then  every  8  weeks  for  an  additional  24 months  (maximum  total 
duration of approximately 30 months [20 doses]) or until ICR confirmed disease progression.  
At the discretion of the investigator, obinutuzumab may have been administered intravenously on Day 
1 (100 mg) and on Day 2 (900 mg) of Cycle 1 instead of 1000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1

Crossover 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients in Arm B were eligible to receive crossover treatment with 
zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab either if they  experienced ICR-confirmed  progressive disease  (PD)  or if 
their disease did not respond to therapy with a complete response (CR) or PR after 12 months; however, 
as of the 25 June 2022 data cut-off date, no patients had crossed over for this latter reason. The PD 
must have been confirmed by independent central review (ICR). For patients who received crossover 
treatment, the safety, laboratory, and response evaluation assessments were continued per the schedule 
of assessments.

Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was overall response rate as determined by independent central review using the 
Lugano Classification for NHL. 
The overall response rate was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved either CR or PR as the 
best overall response, defined as the best response achieved during the entire follow-up period, until the 
data cut-off date, the start of a new anticancer therapy, or the crossover date for patients in Arm B who 
cross over to Arm A.  
Secondary Endpoints – duration of response 
Duration  of  response  as  determined  by  independent  central  review  and  by  investigator  assessment, 
defined as the time from the date that response criteria were first met to the date of first documentation 
of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. For patients in Arm B who crossed over to Arm 
A, the disease assessment after the crossover was not included in the derivation.  
Efficacy Assessments 
Response will be assessed by independent central review and categorized per the Lugano Classification 
for NHL (Cheson et al 2014). The primary endpoint will be ORR based on independent central review. 
Investigators will assess response without knowledge of independent central review results. Response 
parameters  will  include  assessment  of  lymphadenopathy,  hepatomegaly  and  splenomegaly,  blood 
lymphocyte  count,  bone  marrow  aspirate/biopsy,  platelet  count,  haemoglobin  level,  and  neutrophil 
count.  In  the  event  of  a  treatment  delay,  disease  assessments  are  to  continue  per  the  Schedule  of 
Assessments  (Appendix  9).  For  patients  receiving  zanubrutinib,  refer  to  Appendix  2  regarding  the 
assessment of disease progression during study drug holds. 
Imaging Assessments 
All patients must have baseline (within 35 days of randomization) PET/CT scan with contrast of neck, 
chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  and  any  other  disease  sites.  Patients  with  suspected  transformation  of 
disease (eg, a PET/CT with high standardized uptake value-avidity or new onset symptoms) should be 
fully evaluated prior to enrollment on study. 
Screening  findings  will  determine  whether  patients  are  followed  with  contrast-enhanced  PET/CT  or 
contrast-enhanced  CT  only.  Patients  with  disease  that  is  FDG-avid  by  either  site  assessment  or  the 
central imaging vendor must be followed by PET/CT. 
Ideally,  and  depending  on  the  imaging  equipment  available,  contrast-enhanced  CT  should  occur 
combined with PET on a single visit. Combined PET/CT may be used in lieu of a CT with contrast only if 
the CT of the combined PET/CT has been performed with diagnostic quality and contrast is administered. 
PET/CT  scans  are  required  at  screening  and  after  Cycles  3,  6,  and  12.  A  PET/CT  scan  is  required  to 
confirm a result on CT scan (CR/PR or disease progression). CT with contrast will be performed at all 
other tumour assessment timepoints (see Appendix 9, Schedule of Assessments). For patients with a 
contraindication to receiving CT scan IV-contrast (e.g., contrast allergy, or other medical contraindication 
such as renal insufficiency), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in place of CT scans. For 
patients being assessed via MRI, a non-contrast chest CT scan is acceptable, and preferred, in place of 
a chest MRI to evaluate the lung parenchyma. The same imaging technique (i.e., CT, MRI) should be 
used consistently throughout a patient’s time on the study. All efforts will be made to ensure that the 
imaging equipment, contrast agent, and person (investigator or radiologist) performing the evaluation

trial. De-identified copies of all scans and. radiology reports (including those from screening) must be 
provided to the sponsor or designee (e.g., central imaging vendor). 
Modification from Lugano Classification for NHL (Cheson et al 2014): 
Pseudo-progression is defined as an objective tumour response occurring after initial documentation of 
apparent radiological progressive disease and has been observed in patients receiving a BTK inhibitor 
for treatment of follicular lymphoma (Salles et al 2016). For patients in either arm, a timepoint finding 
of “disease progression” will require a confirmatory scan at least 4 weeks after the scan that initially 
demonstrated possible progression. An exception to the confirmatory scan requirement exists if one or 
more  of  the  following  clear,  clinical  signs  of  progression  is  present  and  the  investigator  believes  the 
progression is unequivocal: 
a. Clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including worsening laboratory values) 
b. Deterioration of ECOG performance status 
c.  Rapid  progression  of  disease  or  of  progressive  tumour  at  critical  anatomical  sites  (e.g.,  cord 
compression) that necessitates urgent medical intervention. 
Note: If any of the conditions above are present, no confirmatory scan is required to confirm the disease 
progression. 
Due to the potential for pseudoprogression cases in this study, patients in both Arms A and B should 
remain on study treatment while the patient waits for the confirmation scan results.

Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  is  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  primary  endpoint  of  ORR  in  the  ITT 
Population.  Assuming  ORRA=0.55  and  ORRB=0.30,  210  patients  will  be  enrolled  in  a  2:1  ratio  (140 
patients in arm A and 70 patients in arm B) to provide a power of approximately 91% in testing ORRA 
versus ORRB using a normal approximation to binomial distribution with a 2-sided significance level of 
0.05 with continuity correction. The sample size calculation is based on methods in Hulley et al, 2013 
and Fleiss et al, 1980. 
Randomisation 
Central randomization (2:1) was used to assign patients to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  Arm A: zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 48/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Arm B: obinutuzumab monotherapy 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  the  number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy  (2  to 3  versus  ˃  3),  rituximab-
refractory status (yes versus no), and geographic region (China versus ex-China). Patients who were 
rituximab-refractory  were  defined  as  having  failed  to  respond  to,  or  progressed  during,  any  previous 
rituximab-containing  regimen  (monotherapy  or  combined  with  chemotherapy)  or  having  progressed 
within  6  months  of  the  last  rituximab  dose  in  the  induction  or  maintenance  treatment  settings.  A 
rituximab-containing  regimen  included  at  least  4  weekly  doses  of  rituximab  if  administered  as 
monotherapy,  or  at  least  4  cycles  if  given  as  chemoimmunotherapy.  For  induction  therapy  regimens 
during which a patient had disease progression, the minimum necessary rituximab dose was 1 full cycle 
(monotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy) or 1 dose of 375 mg/m2 (maintenance). 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to the open-label design, blinding was only maintained during treatment allocation and 
assessments by independent central review.  
Statistical methods 
The ITT population, consisting of all randomised patients, was used for the efficacy analyses. The per 
protocol population, defined prior to data base lock, was also used for analysis on the primary endpoint.  
Control of type 1 error was only maintained for the analysis of the primary endpoint.  
ORR 
The comparative analysis of the primary endpoint was done by means Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for 
the null hypothesis, overall response rate for zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab being less or equal 
to the overall response rate for obinutuzumab monotherapy, versus the alternative hypothesis 
of  the  overall  response  rate  for  zanubrutinib  plus  obinutuzumab  being  greater  than  for 
obinutuzumab monotherapy. Testing was performed by a one-sided test with significance level 
at 2.5%. In addition, the 95% CI   of the odds-ratio  of the overall response  rate was derived  
together with Clopper-Pearson 95% CI of the overall response rate per treatment group. 
DoR 
Descriptive statistics was provided for Duration of response per treatment group.  
PFS 
PFS  was  compared  by  the  log-rank  test  stratified  for  stratification  factors  on  the  randomisation.  The 
following censoring rules was applied: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
PFS for patients without any post-baseline disease assessment will be censored at the time of 
randomization 
PFS for patients without disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at 
the time of the last disease assessment 
PFS  for  patients  who  are  lost  to  follow-up  prior  to  documented  disease  progression  will  be 
censored at the last disease assessment date 
PFS for patients who start to receive new anticancer therapy will be censored at the last tumor 
assessment date prior to the introduction of new therapy 
PFS  for  patients  with  disease  progression  or  death  occurring  immediately  after  two  or  more 
missed  consecutive  disease  assessments  will  be  censored  at  the  last  assessment  tumor 
assessment before the missed consecutive disease assessments 
Assessment report

Overall Survival 
OS between the 2 treatment groups will be compared using the same methods employed for the PFS 
comparison.  The  distribution  of  OS  (including  median  and  other  quartiles)  and  OS  rate  at  selected 
timepoints will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Complete Response/Complete Metabolic Response 
CR  rate  and  complete  metabolic  response  rate  will  be  calculated  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
reached  best  overall  response  of  CR  (complete  metabolic  response)  or  higher.  The  CR  and  complete 
metabolic response rate will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. A Clopper-
Pearson 95% CI of complete response rate and complete metabolic response rate will be constructed 
per each arm. 
Time-to-Response 
Time-to-response  will  be  summarized  only  for  responders  by  sample  mean,  median  and  standard 
deviation for each treatment group. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be summarized for each assessment timepoint. The percentage 
of patients with a clinically meaningful change from baseline in ‘global health status/QOL’ and functional 
domains will be summarized as “improved”, “stable” or “worsened” and compared between arms A and 
B. 
The data will also be analyzed using repeated measure mixed model to account for missing data under 
missing at random assumption. Change of EQ-5D-5L score will be summarized descriptively.

Percentages are based on number of patients randomized. 
a For patients in zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab arm, both reasons for discontinuation are reported if the end-of-treatment reasons 
are different. If the end-of-treatment reason is 'completed treatment' for obinutuzumab, only end-of-treatment reason for 
zanubrutinib is reported. 
b Study Follow-up Time is defined as the time from the randomization date to the death date or end of study date (whichever 
occurs first) for patients discontinued from the study, or the database cutoff date for ongoing patients.

Recruitment 
Subjects were enrolled from 14 November 2017 across 83 centres in 17 countries (AU, BG, BY, CA, 
CN, CZ, DE, ES, FR, GB, IT, KR, NZ, PO, RU, TW, US). The majority of patients in the ITT analysis set 
were randomised at sites in Europe (60.8%). The study is ongoing but recruiting has ended.  
First patient treated 14 November 2017.  
Last patient randomised 25 June 2020.  
DCO on 25 June 2022.  
Conduct of the study 
Several protocol amendments were made during the conduct of the study. Major amendments are 
summarised here.  
Amendment 1 (22 December 2017) 
44 patients enrolled in the study under Amendment 1 of the protocol (data on file).  
Key changes to the conduct of the study implemented in Amendment 1 (22 December 2017) were as 
follows: 
• Replaced “BGB-3111” with the International Nonproprietary Name, zanubrutinib 
•  Added  that  patients  in  Arm  B  who  experienced  progressive  disease  while  receiving  obinutuzumab 
monotherapy were eligible to receive crossover treatment with zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab 
• Added text to clarify how and when tumor assessments were performed 
• Modified the definition of adequate organ function for inclusion criterion 10 
• Clarified inclusion criterion 11 to add the definition of women of childbearing potential per the Clinical 
Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance 
• Updated the safety precautions for patients with potential hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities 
• Modified the text to ensure step-up and step-down grades for adverse events were recorded in eCRF 
• Clarified the reporting of nontreatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events 
Amendment 2 (04 February 2019) 
47 patients enrolled in the study under Amendment 2 of the protocol (data on file). Key changes to the 
conduct of the study implemented in Amendment 2 (04 February 2019) were as follows: 
• Added data from a thorough QT study and removed guidance on QT-prolonging medications 
• Added data from drug-drug interaction studies and removed guidance on CYP2 metabolized drugs 
• Modified inclusion criterion 4c to include a note requiring patients in South Korea to have received prior 
bendamustine therapy or have been determined by their treating physician to not be medically suitable 
for bendamustine therapy 
• Modified inclusion criterion 5 to eliminate the requirement that patients experience disease progression 
within 12 months of receiving their last therapy. This revision was made to be consistent with recently 
approved drugs for which the definition of the population was solely based on the number of prior lines 
of therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 52/133 
 
 
 
 
 
• Added exclusion criterion 21 to exclude patients requiring ongoing corticosteroid treatment 
• Added guidance regarding prophylaxis for opportunistic infections 
Amendment 3 (30 June 2019) 
115 patients enrolled in the study under Amendment 3 of the protocol (data on file). Key changes to the 
conduct of the study implemented in Amendment 3 (30 June 2019) were as follows: 
• Corrected an error in the frequency of tumor assessments (including imaging studies). 
Amendment 4 (18 August 2021) 
No patients were enrolled in the study under Amendment 4 of the protocol, as enrollment was completed 
(data on file). Key changes to the conduct of the study implemented in Amendment 4 (18 August 2021) 
were as follows: 
• Changed the timepoint of the primary efficacy analysis from 9 months to 3 months after randomization 
of the last patient 
• Clarified the long-term follow-up assessments required for patients with centrally confirmed disease 
progression 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
First available statistical analysis plan is dated 12 NOV 2021, with an update dated 19 JUL 2022, both of 
which  was  only  most  of  subjects  were  already  randomised.  Both  plans  had  modifications  to  the 
specification of analyses however, the comparative analyses of the primary endpoint, PFS, OS and CR 
agreed with the specifications from the protocol vers. 1. 
The Primary Analysis for this study, reported in a clinical study report with a data cut-off date of 
08  October  2021,  presented  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  at  3  months  after  the  last  patient  was 
randomized into the study (BGB-3111-212 [Data Cutoff Date: 08 October 2021] Clinical Study Report). 
Per a request from the US FDA to provide additional follow-up data for duration of response, an Updated 
Analysis  at  12  months  after  the  last  patient  was  randomized  into the  study  was  conducted.  Updated 
efficacy and safety analyses with a data cut-off date of 25 June 2022 are presented in the clinical study 
report.

FL Efficacy Analysis Set includes all FL patients randomized to treatment in BGB-3111-212 or received any dose of 
zanubrutinib and/or obinutuzumab in BGB-3111-GA101, BGB-3111-AU003 and BGB-3111-1002. All patients 
received ≥ 2 prior line of therapy. 
a Rituximab-Refractory is defined as patients whose best response to any prior Rituximab treatment was Progressive 
Disease or Stable Disease. 
b Refractory to the Most Recent Line of Therapy is defined as patients whose best response to the last prior regimen 
was Progressive Disease or Stable Disease. 
The median number of prior anticancer therapies was 3 lines (range: 2 to 11 lines) and the median time 
from the end of the last therapy to study entry was 8.0 months (range: 0.2 to 197.9 months).  
All  patients  received  ≥  2  prior  lines  of  therapy  and  59  patients  (27.2%)  received  >  3  prior  lines  of 
therapy. Approximately one-third of patients (76 patients [35.0%]) reported stable disease (42 patients 
[19.4%]) or progressive disease (34 patients [15.7%]) as best response to their last therapy.  
Seventy-six patients (35.0%) were refractory to their most recent line of therapy (i.e., best response of 
progressive disease or stable disease), and 141 patients (65.0%) were either not refractory (135 patients 
[62.2%]) or of unknown status (6 patients [2.8%]).  
A total of 147 patients (67.7%) experienced disease progression within 12 months of completing their 
most recent line of therapy.  
All 217 patients in this study received prior rituximab therapy. More than half (114 patients [52.5%]) 
were  refractory  to  rituximab  (defined  as  failure  to  respond  to,  or  progression  during,  any  previous 
rituximab-containing regimen [monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy], or progression within 6 
months of the last rituximab dose, in the induction or maintenance treatment settings). The number of 
patients who were refractory to both rituximab and an alkylating agent were not recorded.  
Overall, 214 patients (98.6%) received at least one prior immunochemotherapy regimen; 119 patients 
(54.8%) received prior bendamustine, 175 patients (80.6%) received prior anthracyclines, 204 patients 
(94.0%) received prior cyclophosphamide, 43 patients (19.8%) received prior PI3K inhibitors, and 21 
patients  (9.7%)  received  prior  immunomodulatory  drugs  (IMiDs;  including  lenalidomide).  Sixty-four 
patients (29.5%) had prior anticancer surgery, 48 patients (22.1%) had prior anticancer radiotherapy, 
and  45  patients  (20.7%)  had  prior  stem  cell  transplantation.  Of  these,  4  patients  had  allogeneic 
transplant and the remaining had received autologous transplant.

Eighteen patients achieved a BOR of partial response or complete response per ICR with < 50% reduction 
in SPD (sum of the products of diameters). All patients had FDG-avid lymphoma and were followed by 
PET-CT/CT  according  to  the  protocol  schedule  of  assessment.  The  18  patients  had  PET-based  BOR 
assessments of partial metabolic response (17 patients) or complete metabolic response (1 patient). For 
the same time points, CT-based assessments were stable disease (14 patients) and disease progression 
(4 patients). Per the ICR Charter v2.0, the overall response will default to the PET radiographic response 
with integrated clinical finding, leading to the BOR as partial response.

There were 18 cases in which the IRC assessed that a complete or partial response had occurred based 
on  the  Lugano  PET-based  criteria,  but  this  assessment  would  have  been  discrepant  compared  to  the 
Lugano CT-based criteria. In this setting, overall response defaulted to the PET-based criteria per the 
IRC charter, as these PET criteria have been shown to be more predictive of true response. 
These  cases  occurred  in  a  2:1  ratio  between  the  zanubrutinib  +  obinutuzumab  arm  and  the 
obinutuzumab  monotherapy  arms  (12  cases  and  6  cases,  respectively).  In  15  of  these  cases,  the 
discrepancy occurred in the first restaging at Cycle  3. Two cases occurred at the second restaging of 
Cycle 6, and one occurred late in treatment on an unscheduled scan on Day 312. 
In the majority of cases (12 of 18), PET-based assessment demonstrated CMR or PMR due to decrease 
in  standardized  uptake  values,  and  there  was  concurrent  lesion  shrinkage.  However,  the  degree  of 
shrinkage was insufficient to qualify for the equivalent CT-based response. In 10 of these cases, PET-
based responses showed PMR, but the decrease in lesion sizes was less than 50% (CT-based SD). In 
one case, PET-based response showed CMR, but the lesions regressed less than 50% (CT-based SD). In 
one case, PET-based assessment showed PMR based on drop in standardized uptake value, but there 
was a slight 1% enlargement of SPD (CT-based SD). 
In two cases, PET-based assessment showed PMR, but lesions enlarged with change of SPD less than 
+50%  (CT-  based  SD).  In  one  of  these  cases,  SPD  decreased  from  baseline  in  the  subsequent  re-
imaging. In the other case, SPD continued to increase in the subsequent scan. 
In three of the remaining cases, PET-based assessment was PMR, with CT-based PD based on growth of 
lesions. In two of these cases, CT-based PD was assessed by the growth of a lesion with increase of SPD 
> 50%. In one case, PET-based response was PMR, but CT showed a mixed response with shrinkage 
and growth of different lesions. However, there was new splenomegaly consistent with PD.

Analysis of 'All Patients in ITT' is stratified as in the primary disease response analysis. Analysis of all other subgroups 
are unstratified. 
The MAH has provided subgroup analyses and a multivariate logistic regression analysis to support the 
efficacy findings despite the imbalances observed between treatment arms (more older patients and 
more patients with poorer performance status (ECOG 1) in arm B). In the multivariate logistic 
regression analysis performed to explore the relationship between the baseline prognostic factors (no 
exact details given); neither age nor ECOG performance status (0 vs ≥ 1) turned out to be significant. 
It seems that the combination therapy was more efficacious than monotherapy also in patients with 
older age and higher ECOG performance (subgroup analysis of disease response) despite these 
imbalances. However, due to the imbalances highlighted, this finding needs to be interpreted with 
caution.

Complete Response Rate 
The CR rate as assessed by independent central review was 39.3% (95% CI: 31.3, 47.8) in arm ZO and 
19.4% (95% CI: 11.1, 30.5) in arm O (Table 14.2.1.5.1 of the BGB-3111-212 Clinical Study Report). 
The 2-sided p-value was 0.0035. 
The CR rate as assessed by the investigator was 29.7% (95% CI: 22.4, 37.8) in arm ZO and 19.4% 
(95% CI: 11.1, 30.5) in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm (Table 14.2.1.5.2 of the BGB-3111-212 
Clinical Study Report). The 2-sided p-value was 0.1401. 
Time to Response 
Time  to  response  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  to  the  time  of  the  earliest  qualifying 
response (CR or PR) until the data cut-off date, the start of a new anticancer therapy, or the crossover 
date for patients who crossed over to receive combination therapy. 
As  assessed  by  independent  central  review,  100  of  145  patients  in  the  combination  arm  and  33  of 
72 patients  in  the  obinutuzumab  monotherapy  arm  reported  a  PR  or  CR  as  their  best  response.  The 
median time to first response was 2.83 months in both arms, with a range of 2.0 to 23.0 months in the 
combination arm and a range of 2.5 to 6.5 months in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm.  
As assessed by the investigator, 99 of 145 patients in the combination arm and 31 of 72 patients in the 
obinutuzumab monotherapy arm reported  a PR or  CR as their best response. For these  patients, the 
median  time  to  first  response  was  the  same  in  both  arms  and  similar  to  what  was  reported  by 
independent  central  review  assessment:  2.83  months,  with  a  range  of  2.0  to  19.7  months  in  the 
combination arm and a range of 2.5 to 16.6 months in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm.

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire in the combination arm were 87% at Week 12 
and 85% in Week 24 and in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm were 80% at Week 12  and 87% in 
Week 24 (Table 14.2.1.8.2 of the BGB-3111-212 Clinical Study Report). For the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, 
the compliance rates in the combination arm were 87% in Week 12 and 84% in Week 24, and in the 
obinutuzumab monotherapy arm were 81% in Week 12 and 87% in Week 24. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
Results  of  the  descriptive  analyses,  mean  changes  (standard  deviation),  from  baseline  to  Week 24, 
showed that patients in the combination arm had better overall outcomes in symptoms of pain, fatigue, 
and  role  functioning  compared  with  patients  in  the  obinutuzumab  monotherapy  arm.  In  both  arms, 
symptoms  of  nausea/vomiting  and  diarrhoea  and  physical  functioning  were  maintained  (remained 
stable).  While  the  global  health  status  (GHS)  endpoint  showed  more  improvement  at  Week  12,  it 
maintained  (remained  stable)  in  the  combination  arm  and  showed  higher  improvement  in  the 
obinutuzumab monotherapy arm by Week 24. 
The  mean  changes  (standard  deviation  [SD])  from  baseline  to  Week  12  and  Week  24  for  these  key 
endpoints are summarized below:  
•

BGB-3111-212 is an ongoing international, phase 2, open-label, randomized, 
active-control study of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab 
monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). 
Central randomization (2:1) was used to assign patients to one of the following 
treatment arms: 
• Arm A: zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab 
• Arm B: obinutuzumab monotherapy 
Randomization was stratified by the number of prior lines of therapy (2 to 3 
versus ˃ 3), rituximab-refractory status (yes versus no), and geographic region 
(China versus ex-China). 
Duration of main phase: 
Patients received daily treatment with 
zanubrutinib until disease progression, 
intolerance or death, withdrawal of consent, 
loss to follow-up, or study termination by 
sponsor.  
Responding patients may have continued to 
receive maintenance obinutuzumab for a 
maximum total duration of approximately 30 
months.  
Initial screening phase (up to 35 days) 
Study treatment must have commenced 
within 5 days after randomisation

In  support  of  the  extension  of  indication  for  zanubrutinib  is:  “BRUKINSA  in  combination  with 
obinutuzumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  refractory  or  relapsed  follicular 
lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies” the MAH submitted data from 
study  BGB-3111-212:  a  phase  2,  open-label,  2:1  randomized  controlled  trial  of  ZO  compared  with 
obinutuzumab monotherapy (O). 
The  MAH  had  also  submitted  supportive  studies,  but  they  have  been  disregarded  in  the  efficacy 
assessment of ZO, either because the regimen was zanubrutinib monotherapy or with obinutuzumab in 
a different regimen (fewer obinutuzumab treatment doses) than in the pivotal 212 study.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  study  population  was  enrolled  according  to  reasonable  criteria.  Patients  must  have  confirmed 
diagnosis FL (grade 1, 2, or 3a) according to the WHO 2008 classification and must have received ≥ 2 
prior systemic treatments for  FL, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an appropriate alkylator-based 
combination therapy. The choice of required prior immunochemotherapies is supported and is reflective 
of practice in first and second line FL treatment in a European setting.  
Disease progression after completion of most recent therapy or refractory disease was a requirement. 
From the clinical perspective, it is important to point out that in follicular lymphoma, disease progression 
does not necessarily equate treatment need. Because the natural course of the disease is characterised 
by spontaneous regressions in some cases and varies significantly from case to case, therapy should be 
initiated  upon  the  development  of  symptoms,  including  B  symptoms  (unexplained  fever  >38°C, 
drenching night sweats or loss of >10% body weight within 6 months), hematopoietic impairment, bulky 
disease,  vital  organ  compression,  ascites,  pleural  effusion  or  rapid  lymphoma  progression.  (ESMO  FL 
guideline, Dreyling et al., annals of oncology, 2020). 
By including patients with disease progression but potentially without treatment need as defined in the 
ESMO guideline or by the GELF criteria, there is risk of selection bias of a study population with a greater 
likelihood of high ORR and better PFS because of a underlying more indolent (or less aggressive) disease.  
Prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor was an exclusion criterion while prior treatment with obinutuzumab 
was not. Unfortunately, not excluding patients previously treated with obinutuzumab (or at least defining 
a time limit regarding prior exposure) allowed inclusion of patients who might have been randomised to 
a monotherapy treatment they potentially could benefit very little from or if at all.  
Treatment 
The  proposed  dose  of  zanubrutinib  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab  in  the  treatment  of  follicular 
lymphoma is 320 mg once daily or 160 mg BID and is thus identical to the recommended doses in the 
approved indications: Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, MZL and CLL. For both arms obinutuzumab 
(1000 mg) was administered intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1; on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; 
and  then  every  8  weeks  for  an  additional  24  months  (maximum  total  duration  of  approximately  30 
months [20 doses]) or until ICR confirmed disease progression. Once started, no end date was defined 
for zanubrutinib BID (except for disease progression, intolerance or death, withdrawal of consent, loss 
to follow-up, or study termination by sponsor). 
Obinutuzumab monotherapy was chosen as comparator in study 212. Obinutuzumab monotherapy for 
FL  is  not  an  EMA  or  FDA  approved  therapy  (only  as  maintenance  therapy  after  initial  combination 
therapy). A phase II randomized trial failed to demonstrate a PFS or OS benefit with obinutuzumab when 
compared with rituximab in 175 patients with relapsed indolent B cell lymphoma (85 percent FL). Among 
patients  with  follicular  lymphoma  (n  =  149),  ORR  seemed  higher  for  obinutuzumab  than  rituximab 
(44.6% v 33.3%; P = .08). This observation was also demonstrated by a blinded independent review 
Assessment report

panel that measured a higher ORR for obinutuzumab (44.6% v 26.7%; P = .01). However, this difference 
did not translate into an improvement in progression-free survival. No new safety signals were observed 
for obinutuzumab, and the incidence of adverse events was balanced between arms, with the exception 
of infusion-related reactions and cough, which  were  higher  in the obinutuzumab  arm. (GAUSS study, 
Sehn et al., J Clin Onc 2015).  
Efficacy  of  obinutuzumab  in  rituximab-refractory  FL  has  previously  been  established  in  the  GADOLIN 
study:  In  rituximab-refractory  cases  or  remissions  lasting  less  than  6  months,  obinutuzumab  in 
combination  with  bendamustine  (plus  obinutuzumab  maintenance)  showed  improved  PFS  and  OS  in 
comparison with bendamustine only. (Gadolin study, Cheson et al., J Clin Oncol., 2018).   
In the GALLIUM study, obinutuzumab (immunochemotherapy and maintenance for 2 years) resulted in 
significantly prolonged PFS in comparison with rituximab in 1st line treatment of FL. There was no OS 
benefit.  
In clinical practice anti-CD20 monotherapy for R/R FL is mostly reserved for comorbid patients who are 
poor candidates for chemoimmunotherapy due to toxicity concerns or who have low tumour burden or 
a phenotype of slowly progressing disease (typically over years).  
The study population in study 212 had low ECOG PS and a median age under 65 years and it could be 
argued that most of these patients would be insufficiently treated with anti-CD20 monotherapy in clinical 
practice. On the other hand, the study population had disease that had progressed after at least two 
systemic  treatment  lines  (including  chemoimmunotherapy)  and  novel  monotherapy  and  combination 
therapy  options  are  desirable  in  this  setting  where  surviving  patients  eventually  will  have  exhausted 
treatment options.  
Although open-label and not placebo-controlled, the trial design makes it possible to assess the efficacy 
of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab in comparison with obinutuzumab monotherapy. This 
said, double-blinding could have been possible in this case, with IV obinutuzumab as backbone in both 
arms and zanubrutinib vs. oral placebo. 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients in  the  obinutuzumab monotherapy arm were eligible to 
receive  crossover  to  treatment  with  zanubrutinib  +  obinutuzumab  either  if  they  experienced  ICR-
confirmed  progressive  disease  (PD)  or  if  their  disease  did  not  respond  to  therapy  with  a  complete 
response (CR) or PR after 12 months. According to the MAH, only one patient crossed over for this latter 
reason.  
The OS result will nevertheless be confounded by crossover, as will be the PFS analyses to the extent 
that crossover in fact could have taken place before IRC-confirmed progression. It should be noted that 
in the scientific advice given by EMA in 2017, the CHMP recommended against crossover.  
The primary endpoint was overall response rate as determined by independent central review using the 
Lugano  Classification  for  NHL.  Key  secondary  endpoints  include  ORR  as  determined  by  investigator 
assessment, DOR as determined by ICR and by investigator assessment, PFS as determined by ICR and 
by  investigator  assessment  and  OS  analysis.  Overall,  the  endpoints  are  supported.  If  the  study  is  of 
adequate size, ORR if backed up by DOR and PFS can provide clinically relevant data that potentially can 
support a benefit/risk assessment. At the data cut-off patients had had the opportunity to be treated for 
at least 12 months, hence the data is considered final for the assessment of  ORR. The DoR and  PFS 
effects observed from the study population are, however, still subject to uncertainty due to relative data 
immaturity. Hence submi updated efficacy data as a post authorisation recommendation was requested 
and has been confirmed by the MAH.

The MAH had  introduced a response  category called  non-progressive disease  into  to the  IRC  charter, 
which is not part of the Lugano classification system used for assessment of responses in FL. Apart from 
this deviation both IRC and the investigator were required to use the 2014 Lugano response criteria.  
The study was appropriately powered to demonstrate a s difference in the primary endpoint ORR between 
treatment arms with 91% probability assuming that the true ORR in the arm A and arm B are 0.55 and 
0.3,  respectively.  Using  a  2:1  ratio,  140  and  70  patients  were  to  be  enrolled  to  arm  A  and  arm  B. 
respectively. The observed ORR are  higher than those used for sample size calculation, however, the 
difference in ORR between the arms corresponds to what was expected. 
Four amendments were made to the protocol. Summaries can be found in section 5.4 conduct of the 
study. Crossover option was added in amendment 1. In amendment 2, inclusion criterion 5 was modified 
to eliminate the requirement that patients experience disease progression within 12 months of receiving 
their last therapy. Although this modification can alter the study population it is supported as there is no 
need to exclude patients who had disease progression more than 12 months after receiving their last 
therapy.  In  amendment  2,  exclusion  criterion  21  was  added  to  exclude  patients  requiring  ongoing 
corticosteroid  treatment.  This  is  not  an  uncommon  exclusion  criterion  in  clinical  trials  in  follicular 
lymphoma.  
The  median  age  was  64.0  years.  Most  patients  were  ≥  60  years  of  age  (63.6%).  Of  note,  despite 
randomisation,  there  was  an  imbalance  in  age;  with  arm  O  having  more  patients  ≥  65  years  old 
compared with arm ZO (55.6% versus 42.8%, respectively). 
The ZO arm had more males than females and was slightly younger; 61.1 vs. 62.9 years. In spite of 
randomisation, there was an imbalance with regard to ECOG performance status. For ECOG PS 0 there 
were more patients in the ZO arm (59.3% vs. 43.1%) and fewer with ECOG PS 1 (37.2% vs. 55.6%).   
It cannot be excluded that the imbalances regarding ECOG PS status and patients ≥ 65 years old could 
have affected study outcomes and favoured the ZO arm that had more patients under 65 years of age 
and more patients with ECOG PS 0.  
The median time since initial diagnosis to study entry was 86.2 months (range: 5.1 to 359.0 months). 
At screening (not at initial diagnosis), most patients had a Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic 
Index (FLIPI) risk of intermediate or high (172 patients [79.2%]) and were Ann Arbor Stage III or IV 
(179 patients [82.5%]). 
The median number of prior anticancer therapies was 3 lines (range: 2 to 11 lines). Median time from 
end of last therapy was higher in the ZO arm (8.77 months vs. 6.28 months), but both medians were 
low. Best response for last therapy was balanced between study arms with slightly more in the ZO arm 
achieving CR or PR (64.2% vs. 58.3%). Less patients in the ZO arm were refractory to the most recent 
line of therapy (32.4% vs. 40.3%) suggesting a potential increased likelihood of a better response to 
next treatment (ZO). Less patients in the ZO arm had progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) 
of starting the first line of therapy (34.5% vs 41.7%). 
The  prior  therapies  given  to  the  study  population  was  as  expected  in  patients  with  R/R  follicular 
lymphoma  who  have  received  minimum  two  prior  lines  of  systemic  therapy.  Prior  treatments  were 
balanced between study arms. Disease history and prior treatment information shows that there was a 
high proportion of patients with stage III or IV disease, a median of 3 prior lines of therapy and a median 
time from end of last therapy till study entry of 8 months indicating that the study population could be 
considered as having a poor prognosis. Some patients had a long remission before entering study 212 
but the majority had  progressed or had  refractory  disease within 12 months indicating selection of a 
patient  population  where  new  longer  lasting  remissions  might  not  be  easily  attainable.  Although  the 
patients were randomised, there were imbalances in the study populations favouring the ZO arm with

regard to best response for last therapy, refractoriness to most recent line of therapy and POD24, age, 
and ECOG status.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ORR 
The study met its primary endpoint with ORR (patients achieving a CR or PR) as assessed by ICR of 
69.0% (95% CI: 60.8, 76.4) in the ZO arm and 45.8% (95% CI: 34.0, 58.0) in the O arm (using the 
Lugano Classification for NHL). The risk difference was 22.7% (95% CI: 9.0, 36.5), and the 2-sided p-
value  was  0.0012.  ORR  results  were  more  favourable  in  patients  who  did  not  meet  GELF  criteria  vs. 
those  who  did.    In  arm  ZO,  the  ORR  in  patients  who  met  GELF  criteria  was  62.7%  (51.3,  73.0)  vs. 
patients who did not meet GELF criteria was 77.4% (65.0, 87.1).  
The risk difference between arm ZO and arm O for  patients who met GELF criteria was 17.7% (-1.0, 
36.3). For patients who did not meet GELF criteria the risk difference was 30.5% (10.4, 50.7). 
The ICR could assign to a fabricated response category called non-progressive disease. However, this 
response category is not part of the Lugano classification for NHL and the investigator could not assign 
this response category. However, a sensitivity analysis revealed no impact on the primary endpoint by 
this fabricated response category.  
Subgroup analyses of disease response by ICR showed higher overall response rates in arm ZO across 
all subgroups including older patients and patients with ECOG PS 1, which were groups where there was 
imbalance despite randomisation.  
ORR  by  investigator  was  overall  concordant  with  ICR  assessment.  A  requested  sensitivity  analyses 
reassigning the fabricated response category non-progressive disease with a CT based response showed 
results consistent with the primary analysis.  
While  obinutuzumab  might  be  a  subpar  comparator  in  younger  fit  patients,  study  indicates  212  that 
zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab shows superior ORR in comparison with obinutuzumab 
monotherapy in a patient population deemed to have a poor prognosis due to progression after at least 
two prior systemic therapies and with a proclivity to early relapse.    
DOR 
As assessed by independent central review for the ITT Analysis Set, the median duration of response 
was not reached (95% CI: 25.3 months, not evaluable [NE]) in arm ZO with a median follow-up time of 
16.9 months (range: 0.0 to 41.2 months) and 14.0 months (95% CI: 9.2, 25.1 months) in arm O with 
a  median  follow-up  time  of  23.3  months  (range:  0.0  to  32.7  months).  There  was  a  high  degree  of 
censoring (71%) in the ZO arm.  
PFS 
As assessed by the ICR, the median PFS was 28.0 months (95% CI: 16.1, NE) in arm ZO with a median 
follow-up time of 19.4 months (range: 0.0 to  44.0 months). In arm O median PFS  was 10.4 months 
(95% CI: 6.5, 13.8) with a median follow-up time of 23.1 months (range: 0.0 to 38.1 months). 60.7% 
and 38.9% were censored respectively.  
The hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.75) with a 2-sided p-value of 0.0007. 
As assessed by the investigator for the ITT Analysis Set, median PFS was higher in arm ZO: 16.3 months 
(95% CI: 11.0, 27.4) with a median follow-up time of 22.2 months (range: 0.0 to 38.8 months) in arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 79/133 
 
 
 
 
ZO and 5.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 7.9) with a median follow-up time of 23.1 months (range: 0.0 to 38.1 
months) in arm O.  
The PFS difference between treatment arms for patients who met GELF criteria was limited, 15.2m 
(9.5, 28.0) in arm ZO vs 11.8 (5.6, 17.5) in arm O.  
The MAH has provided additional results for DoR and PFS based on EMA guideline on censoring. For 
both endpoints the results of the analysis of the predefined censor rule and the censor rule required by 
EMA were quite similar in both treatment groups. 
In conclusion, zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab shows superior PFS in comparison with 
obinutuzumab monotherapy. However, it is noted that PFS estimates and rate of censoring vary 
considerably between the ICR and the investigator assessment but additional requested sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the primary analyses done by the MAH.  Robust data on DOR and PFS could 
support the efficacy of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab for FL based on the primary 
endpoint of ORR. At this point, DOR and PFS data are considered supportive but uncertainties remain 
due to the relative data immaturity. The MAH will submit updated efficacy data (DOR, PFS, OS) post 
authorisation following a CHMP recommendation.  
Median  OS  was  not  reached  in  arm  ZO  and  was  34.6  months  (95%  CI:  29.3,  NE)  in  arm  O.  Median 
follow-up times were similar: 23.3 months  (range:  0.1 to  44.5 months) in arm  ZO and 23.9 months 
(range: 0.1 to 44.3 months) in arm O. The hazard ratio was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.07) with a 2-sided 
p-value of 0.0845. No OS detriment was observed.  
Crossover from arm O to ZO was allowed by the investigator. Apparently 35 patients from the O arm 
were crossed over to the ZO upon progression. Crossover confounds the OS analysis. Additionally, it can 
be assumed that there will potentially be imbalances in post-protocol therapy between study arms which 
can confound OS analysis further. Benefit in terms of increased OS has not been demonstrated, and due 
to extensive cross-over between the treatment arm the final OS data are not likely to be conclusive. 
In the supportive study GA101 obinutuzumab was only given for the first 6 cycles (8 infusions instead 
of 20 in study 212). This limits the value of the study as supportive efficacy data because treatments 
are not fully comparable across the two studies.  
Having this limitation in mind, ORR and CR rates from study GA101 are supportive of the main study.  
The  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  studies  (003  and  1002)  are  not  considered  supportive  with  regard  to 
evaluating the efficacy of combination therapy with zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab. 
Although follicular lymphoma tends to behave as an indolent disease, the targeted population is deemed 
to  have  a  poor  prognosis  due  to  progression  after  at  least  two  prior  systemic  therapies  and  with  a 
proclivity  to  early  relapse.  In  patients  with  multiple  relapsed  FL,  effective  and  easily  manageable 
treatment options are limited. While FL behaves as a chronic, incurable disease albeit with a long natural 
history and survival often measured in decades, disease eventually relapses. Further treatment options 
are  thus  needed,  especially  in  patients  with  symptomatic  relapse  /  rapid  progression  after  previous 
therapy.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab in adult patients with relapsed FL who 
have previously received at least two systemic therapies, displayed a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful benefit over obinutuzumab in terms of ORR. This improvement in the primary endpoint was 
supported by DoR and PFS. 
While the observed responses appear to be durable, uncertainty remains regarding the duration of these 
effects due to limited follow-up. Study BGB-3111-212 is ongoing. The MAH will submit updated efficacy 
(ORR, DoR, PFS) post-authorisation - in Q4-2024, following a recommendation from the CHMP.

b Safety data collected from LTE1 study for 373 patients who were dosed at either 160 mg BID or 320 mg QD in the 
parent studies (BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-3111-1002, BGB-3111-205, BGB-3111-206, BGB-3111-210, BGB-3111-
214, and BGB-3111-302) are grouped with data from the parent studies in all data summaries and analysis described 
herein. The LTE data of a patient who discontinued the parent study due to “patient diagnosed with other cancer that 
needed treatment” on 18 September 2017 and then enrolled in LTE study for zanubrutinib treatment was not 
included. 
c This total only includes patients receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy and excludes patients from BGB-3111-212 
and BGB-3111-GA101. 
Study BGB-3111-212 is an ongoing international, Phase 2, open-label, randomized, active control study 
of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab monotherapy in patients with R/R FL. This study 
is being conducted in 17 countries worldwide. 
For combination therapy studies BGB-3111-212 and BGB 3111 GA101, a treatment-emergent adverse 
event was defined as an adverse event with an onset date or an increase in severity on or after the first 
dose  of  study  treatment  until  30  or  90  days  after  the  last  dose  of  zanubrutinib  or  obinutuzumab, 
respectively, or before initiation of a new anticancer  therapy, whichever occurred first; this definition 
also applied to patients in Study BGB-3111-212 who crossed over from obinutuzumab monotherapy to 
zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab combination therapy.  
For zanubrutinib monotherapy studies, a treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse 
event with an onset date or an increase in severity on or after the first dose of zanubrutinib until 30 days

after the last dose of zanubrutinib or before initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred 
first.  
Worsening  of  an  event  to  Grade  5  beyond  30  or  90  days  after  the  last  dose  of  zanubrutinib  or 
obinutuzumab,  respectively,  was  also  considered  a  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  if  it  occurred 
before initiation of a new anticancer therapy. Only those adverse events that were treatment emergent 
are included in the summary tables.

Adverse events 
For combination therapy studies BGB-3111-212 and BGB 3111 GA101, a treatment-emergent adverse 
event was defined as an adverse event with an onset date or an increase in severity on or after the first 
dose  of  study  treatment  until  30  or  90  days  after  the  last  dose  of  zanubrutinib  or  obinutuzumab, 
respectively, or before initiation of a new anticancer  therapy, whichever occurred first; this definition 
also applied to patients in Study BGB-3111-212 who crossed over from obinutuzumab monotherapy to 
zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab combination therapy.  
For zanubrutinib monotherapy studies, a treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse 
event with an onset date or an increase in severity on or after the first dose of zanubrutinib until 30 days

Study 212: 
In  the  ZO  group,  35  (24.5%)  patients  died  while  on  study.  Overall,  14  (9.8%)  patients  had  adverse 
events leading to death, an increase of 2 patients from the original SCS; the new adverse events leading 
to death were Pneumonia and Adenocarcinoma pancreas (1 patient each). 
Study 212/Combination therapy:  
The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the combination arm and the obinutuzumab 
monotherapy  arm  and,  consistent  with  this  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to  death  was 
comparable in zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab group with that found in obinutuzumab monotherapy group. 
The small sizes of the patient groups add uncertainty to these findings. 
The MAH has provided the requested narratives for all patients who died in study 212. Generally, if not 
due to PD, the fatal AEs were most frequently due to infections, which is common in these patients both 
due to the disease itself as well as prior and current treatment. One patient had a “metastatic neoplasm” 
and one patient died due to AML.   
In the monotherapy pool 78/1550 patients died within 30 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib or 
within 90 days after the last dose of obinutuzumab due to an adverse event. Not unexpectedly in a late 
line lymphoma population the most frequent cause was related to infections including COVID-19.

The  majority  of  SAEs  belonged  to  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations  for  both  the  combination  and 
monotherapy treatment.

Study 212/combination therapy: 
Overall there were more SAEs in the ZO arm compared to the O arm with the most frequent belonging 
to the SOC Infections and Infestations with the frequency in the ZO arm being more than twice that of 
the O arm.  
Monotherapy pool:  
There  were  overall  more  SAEs  in  the  monotherapy  pool  compared  to  the  combination  therapy  pool 
despite the added obinutuzumab in the latter. This is most likely due to the more than double exposure 
in the monotherapy pool, as previously explained.

Potential Hy’s Law Cases: 
Liver function test results were evaluated for all patients who received zanubrutinib and/or obinutuzumab 
for evidence of potential drug-induced liver injury per Hy’s Law criteria. Hy’s law criteria requires ALT or 
AST values > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin values > 2 x ULN. 
In Study BGB-3111-212, no cases of Hy’s law were observed. 
Haematology 
The overall incidences of abnormal laboratory values were similar between the combination arm of 
Study 212 and the zanubrutinib monotherapy group. However, decreased neutrophil and platelet count 
were common and zanubrutinib adds to this known obinutuzumab. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
as AEs have been discussed previously.  
Chemistry 
No clinically relevant differences between patient groups were observed for serum chemistry analytes 
of interest for postbaseline shifts of ≥ 2 toxicity grades. Increases of ≥ 2 toxicity grades in ALT or AST 
were reported in less than 3% of patients in every patient group; no ≥ 2 toxicity-grade shifts in AST 
were reported in study 212.

[0.6%] patients).  
Dose interruption:  
In the Study BGB-3111-212 (zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab) group, 78 (54.5%)patients reported 
≥ 1 dose interruption because of an adverse event, an increase of 4 patients from the original SCS. The 
most  common  events  were  COVID-19  (12  [8.4%]  patients),  Pneumonia  (8 [5.6%]  patients),  and 
Thrombocytopenia and Pyrexia (6 [4.2%] patients each). 
In the Study BGB-3111-212 (obinutuzumab) group, 31 (43.7%) patients had ≥ 1 dose interruption 
because of an adverse event, no change from the original SCS (Error! Reference source not found.). 
The most common events were Infusion related  reaction (6 [8.5%]  patients), Neutropenia (4  [5.6%] 
patients),  and  Abdominal  pain,  Neutrophil  count  decreased,  Platelet  count  decreased,  and  Chills  (3 
[4.2%] patients each).  
In the All Patients group, 733 (47.3%) patients reported ≥ 1 dose interruption because of an adverse 
event.  The  most  common  events  were  Neutropenia  (80  [5.2%]  patients),  Pneumonia  (73  [4.7%] 
patients), COVID-19 (53 [3.4%] patients), Diarrhoea (38 [2.5%] patients), and COVID-19 pneumonia 
and Vomiting (31 [2.0%] patients each).  
Post marketing experience 
There are no postmarketing data for zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab combination therapy. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment consists of two parts: One for safety in FL patients receiving the combination of 
zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab (ZO; compared to obinutuzumab monotherapy; O) and an update of the 
entire  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  population  of  1550  R/R  patients  with  B-cell  malignancies  in  the 
currently approved SmPC. 
The pivotal study for the combination regimen was study 212 (ZO; N=143, O; N=71) with support from 
study  GA101  (N=36).  Treatment  with  zanubrutinib  and  obinutuzumab  was  open  label.  In  study  212, 
patients received zanubrutinib 160 mg twice a day orally and obinutuzumab 1000 mg intravenously on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1; on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; and then every 8 weeks for a maximal total of 
20  infusions.  In  the  supportive  study  GA101  obinutuzumab  was  only  given  for  the  first  6  cycles  (a 
maximum  of  8  infusions  instead  of  a  maximum  of  20  infusions),  so  the  AE  profile  is  not  directly 
comparable between the two studies, which is why study 212 is the main study for safety assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 123/133 
 
 
 
 
 
of the ZO combination regimen. The difference in treatment doses between the two studies is clearly 
shown in Table 3/SCS were patients in study 212 (which is ongoing) received a median of 13 cycles of 
zanubrutinib and 11 doses of obinutuzumab,  whereas in study GA101, patients received 29 cycles of 
zanubrutinib but only 9 doses of obinutuzumab. Thus, the safety population for the ZO combination is 
based on study 212 and the MAH has updated the SmPC accordingly.  
For the monotherapy pool an update using the most recent DCO for the studies included was provided.   
Exposure:  
Combination  therapy:  For  study  212  (DCO  25  October  2022)  the  median  duration  of  zanubrutinib 
treatment was 12.35 months (0.5 to 48.1 months). Patients completed a median of 13.43 zanubrutinib 
treatment cycles (range: 0.5 to 52.3 cycles) and a median of 11.0 obinutuzumab infusions (3.0 to 20.0 
infusions) with a median relative dose intensity for zanubrutinib of 98.9% (30.7% to 100.0%). In the 
obinutuzumab arm patients completed a median of 9.0 infusions (range: 3.0 to 20.0 infusions). Dose 
reductions of obinutuzumab were not allowed in the study. 
Monotherapy safety pool: In the All Patients monotherapy group, the median duration of zanubrutinib 
treatment  was  34.41  months  (range:  0.1  to  90.0  months).  Patients  completed  a  median  of  37.41 
zanubrutinib  treatment  cycles  (range:  0.1  to  97.8  cycles).  A  total  of  1270  (82%)  patients  had  ≥  12 
months of treatment, 1035 (66.8%) patients had ≥ 24 months of treatment, and 697 (45%) patients 
had ≥ 36 months of treatment.  
For the FL patients in the monotherapy pool (N=59) the median duration of treatment was markedly 
lower (8.34 months) than in the entire monotherapy pool (N=1550; 34.41 months) limiting the value of 
a comparison between the All patients monotherapy pool and the FL patients in this pool. 
Baseline and disease characteristics: 
In study 212 the baseline and disease characteristics where generally comparable between the two arms: 
One possible significant difference favouring the ZO arm was a higher percentage of patients with ECOG 
0 (59.4% vs 43.7%).  
There were some differences between the ZO arm of study 212 and the monotherapy pool: The median 
age was 63.0 and 67.0 and ECOG 0 was 59.4% and 44.6%, respectively. The number of prior treatments 
were 3 and 2, respectively. The main difference lies in the exposure time, as previously described.  
Adverse events:  
Reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of zanubrutinib monotherapy, 
and there were no unexpected findings. At the same time it is worth noticing that the patient populations 
in  the  studies  concerning  follicular  lymphoma  (FL)  were  relatively  small  and,  thus,  any  unexpected 
signals were unlikely to be identified. 
Combination  therapy:  The  addition  of  zanubrutinib  to  obinutuzumab  did  not  substantially  increase 
toxicity compared to single-agent obinutuzumab, although some differences were seen: In study 212 
there were higher frequencies of the All grades AEs Infections (by SOC) and thrombocytopenia in the 
ZO arm compared to the O arm. AEs of ≥Grade 3 and SAEs in the SOC Infections and Infestations were 
the most frequent event occurring twice as frequent in the ZO arm compared to the O arm. The frequency 
was similar to  the monotherapy  pool but here  the  duration of  exposure to zanubrutinib is more than 
double the exposure in study 212 and the high ≥Grade 3 infection frequency for the ZO combination is 
thus a cause for concern. Updated safety data was requested, but as 90% of patients in the O arm and 
67% in the ZO arm have discontinued the study at the DCO of 25 June 2022 this will not be of much 
additional value for the comparison to the obinutuzumab arm given the low number of patients left in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023

this arm, but data from the ZO arm may be compared to the zanubrutinib monotherapy pool; there was 
a small rise in AE incidences with +4 months longer follow up but no new ADRs.  
Pronounced thrombocytopenia was reported more frequently in the combination therapy groups than in 
the monotherapy groups.  However, despite the decrease in platelet count no increase in the incidence 
of haemorrhage was observed, which could be due to the small size of the population. Thrombocytopenia 
and haemorrhage are described in the SmPC.  
Monotherapy safety pool: There were minor increases in various AE frequencies, but no change to the 
cruder adverse reaction frequency groups (Very common, Common etc.) were observed neither for the 
All Grades nor the ≥ Grade 3 categories. 
Combination therapy: There were 14 AEs leading to death in the ZO arm: Generally, if not due to PD the 
fatal AEs were due to infections (Table 13/uSCS), which is common in these patients both due to the 
disease itself as well as prior and current treatment.   
In the monotherapy pool 78/1550 patients died within 30 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib due to 
an adverse event. Not unexpectedly in a late line lymphoma population the main cause was related to 
infections including COVID-19. 
The MAH has made an update on the summary of adverse events (the ”All Zanubrutinib” safety data 
set) with new data cut offs (the SmPC document). The data set contains the total 1550 patients, and 
the median duration of exposure has increased after the previous approved SmPC version from 22.95 
months to 34.41 months: No change to the cruder adverse reactions frequency groups (Very common, 
Common etc.) were observed neither for the All Grades nor the ≥Grade 3 categories.  
As the number of patients in other race categories than White and Asian were few, the comparison was 
limited to these  categories. In the monotherapy pool  the proportion of patients experiencing adverse 
events was similar in White patients and in Asian patients across all patient groups, - whereas for study 
212 a rather large difference is seen for eg. SAEs in both arms between White and Asian race.  
Approximately 2/3 of the patients in study 212 were from Europe and 1/5 were from the Asian region. 
One of the three stratification factors was geographic region (China versus ex-China). The rates of ≥ 
Grade 3 adverse events, serious adverse events, TEAE leading to death, treatment discontinuation, 
and dose reduction were lower in the China group similarly in both ZO and O arms. It is agreed, that 
this may in part be due to the China patients being 7 or 10 years younger than the global patients. It 
could also be partly due to underreporting. Whatever the explanation the China patients contribute to 
a lower incidence of these adverse events, which is not ideal, but is not considered to have an impact 
on the benefit-risk.  
The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  preferred  terms  in  the  SOC  Infections  and 
Infestations both in the combination treatment and the monotherapy pool. Despite the shorter exposure 
in study 212 the frequency was higher than in the monotherapy pool; this could be due to both the ZO 
combination  as  well  as  the  fact  that  study  212  was  conducted  to  a  larger  part  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic compared to the monotherapy pool as COVID-19 infections were higher in study 212 (both 
arms although higher in the ZO arm) compared to the monotherapy pool. Despite this, it is considered 
safe to conclude that the combination of ZO enhances the risk of infection compared to obinutuzumab 
monotherapy.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the dossier with the DCO of 25-OCT-2022, the safety results in the combination regimen were 
consistent with the known safety profile of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab with no unexpected findings. 
With the updated data (median duration of exposure of 34.41 months) in the monotherapy pool, no new 
or unanticipated safety signals were seen.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This is an extension of indication for zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab in the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  refractory  or  relapsed  follicular  lymphoma  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior 
systemic therapies. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Medical treatment for R/R follicular lymphoma depends on the stage and severity of the disease, as well 
as the age and overall health status of the patient, prior therapies and responses and response durations 
to prior therapies. Treatment options typically include rituximab monotherapy, or combinations of anti-
CD20  monoclonal  antibodies  (rituximab,  obinutuzumab)  with  chemotherapeutic  agents  (such  as 
cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  bendamustine).  Commonly  used  regimens  are  R-
bendamustine,  R-CVP  and  R-CHOP.  Autologous  or  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant  is  also  a  treatment 
option in selected cases. Additional treatment options include the PI3K-δ  inhibitor idelalisib,  the  PI3K 
inhibitor  duvelisib, 
lenalidomide  (in  combination  with  rituximab),  the  bispecific  antibody 
mosunetuzumab and the CAR-T therapies axicabtagene ciloleucel and Tisagenlecleucel. 
With each relapse of FL, the duration of remission tends to be shorter. Acceptable options for patients 
with  R/R  FL  eventually  become  somewhat  limited  and  may  not  be  accessible  for  all  patients,  either 
because of advanced patient age (precluding use of stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, or cellular 
therapy), or limited bone marrow reserve following prior therapies or comorbidities (e.g., hepatic, renal, 
pulmonary or cardiac impairment). Thus, treatments capable of inducing high rates of durable responses 
with favourable safety and tolerability profiles are still needed in the high-risk population of patients with 
R/R FL, especially in second or later relapse. 
To date, there are no BTK inhibitors approved in EU for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  212  is  an  ongoing  international,  phase  2,  open-label,  randomized,  active-control  study  of 
zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory 
follicular lymphoma (FL). Patients were above 18 years of age, had a histologically confirmed diagnosis 
of B-cell FL (Grade 1, 2, or 3a) and had received ≥ 2 prior systemic treatments for FL (including an anti-
CD20 antibody and an appropriate alkylator-based combination therapy). Central randomization (2:1) 
was used to assign patients to one of the following treatment arms: 
• Arm A (arm ZO): zanubrutinib + obinutuzumab 
• Arm B (arm O): obinutuzumab monotherapy 
Zanubrutinib was administered as two 80-mg capsules orally twice a day (160 mg twice a day). Each 
treatment cycle was 28 days. Treatment duration was until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. 
Obinutuzumab (1000 mg) was administered intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1; on Day 1 of 
Cycles 2 to 6; and then every 8 weeks for an additional 24 months.  
Primary endpoint was ORR as determined by ICR using the Lugano Classification for NHL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 128/133 
 
 
 
 
 
Key secondary endpoints included ORR as determined by investigator assessment, DOR as determined 
by ICR and by investigator assessment, and PFS as determined by ICR and by investigator 
assessment. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint: ORR as assessed by ICR was 69.0% in arm ZO and 45.8% in arm 
O.  ORR  risk  difference  was  22.7%  (95%  CI:  9.0,  36.0,  p-value  (CMH)  0.0012).    ORR  assessed  by 
investigator was concordant. Responses were observed across most predefined subgroups. 
Median DOR by ICR was not reached in arm ZO and was 14.0 months in arm O (median FU 17 and 23 
months, respectively, and 22% events across arms). 
Median PFS by ICR was 28.0 months in arm ZO and was 10.4 months in arm O (median FU 19 and 23 
months, respectively, and 47% events across arms). 
Acknowledging possible confounding due to cross-over (35 out of 72 patients from O to ZO), median 
OS was not reached in arm ZO and was 34.6 months in arm O (median FU around 23 months and 23% 
events across arms). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
PFS estimates and rate of censoring vary considerably between the ICR and the investigator assessment.   
Due  to  the  short  follow-up,  uncertainties  regarding  PFS  and  DoR  estimates  remain  and  the  MAH  will 
provide updated efficacy data as a post authorisation recommendation.   
Due to open label design of the study, the value and interpretation of PROs is very limited. 
The MAH will submit updated efficacy (ORR, DoR, PFS) data from the  ROSEWOOD study (BGB-3111-
212) post-authorisation following a recommendation from the CHMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
 In the combination study 212 there were higher frequencies of the All grades AEs Infections (by SOC) 
in the ZO arm compared to the O arm. AEs of ≥ Grade 3 and SAEs in the SOC Infections and 
Infestations were the most frequent event, occurring twice as frequent in the ZO arm compared to the 
O arm. The frequency was similar to the monotherapy pool but here the duration of exposure to 
zanubrutinib is more than double the exposure in study 212 and the high ≥ Grade 3 infection 
frequency for the ZO combination is thus a cause for concern. Updated safety data was requested, but 
since 90% of patients in the O arm and 67% in the ZO arm have discontinued the study at the DCO of 
25 June 2022, this will not be of much additional value for the comparison to the obinutuzumab arm 
given the low number of patients left in this arm, but data from the ZO arm may be compared to the 
zanubrutinib monotherapy pool: there was a small rise in AE incidences with +4 months longer follow 
up but no new ADRs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the combination study 212 (DCO 25 October 2022) the median duration of zanubrutinib treatment 
was only 12.35 months (0.5 to 48.1 months). Results from the monotherapy pool has shown that adverse 
events increase gradually with time on treatment, so higher AE frequencies in the ZO combination could 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510757/2023  
Page 129/133 
 
 
 
 
be expected, as demonstrated with the +4 months update. Furthermore, the small number of patients 
in study 212 represents some uncertainty.  
The MAH will submit safety data from the ROSEWOOD study (BGB-3111-212) as a post-authorisation 
commitment following a recommendation from the CHMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The use  of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab demonstrated an improvement of efficacy 
compared to obinutuzumab monotherapy regimens with significantly more patients achieving response 
(CR or PR); 69.0% vs. 45.8% (2-sided p-value of 0.0012). Considering the poor prognosis of multiple 
relapsed  FL,  the  observed  magnitude  of  PFS  difference  (while  immature)  is  also  considered  clinically 
meaningful.  
The observed responses appeared to be durable: the median DoR was longer in the arm A (zanubrutinib 
combination with obinutuzumab) compared to the arm B (obinutuzumab alone), with median duration 
of response was not reached in arm A.  The DoR data are also considered immature.   
The OS data are immature and due to extensive cross-over between the treatment arms, OS data will 
be  of  limited  value  and  difficult  to  interpret.  The  MAH  will  submit  updated  efficacy  data  following  a 
recommendation from the CHMP. 
The combination of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab has added to the known toxicity of the individual 
medicines, however, the adverse events appear manageable and given the relatively poor prognosis in 
the third line FL setting, is considered acceptable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy  with  regard  to  ORR  for  zanubrutinib  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab  can  be  considered 
clinically  relevant  in  this  patient  population  (third  line  setting)  and  is  supported  by  DoR  and  PFS 
estimates. 
The majority of adverse events observed are considered manageable in the clinical setting.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brukinsa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include in combination with obinutuzumab treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic treatments for 
BRUKINSA; based on results from studies BGB-3111-212 and BGB-3111-GA101-001. BGB-3111-212 is 
an ongoing international, Phase 2, open-label, randomized (2:1), active control study of zanubrutinib 
plus obinutuzumab (Arm A) versus obinutuzumab monotherapy (Arm B) in patients with R/R FL. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate (ORR); while BGB-3111-GA101-001 is a Phase 1b 
Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Antitumor Activity of the Combination of BGB-3111 with 
Obinutuzumab in Subjects with B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 5.0 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial 
changes to the SmPC. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Brukinsa is not similar to Gazyvaro, Lunsumio, Kymriah 
and Yescarta within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR

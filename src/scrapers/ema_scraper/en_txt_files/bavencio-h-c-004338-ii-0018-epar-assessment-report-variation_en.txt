2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) includes tumours originating from the urothelial cells lining the bladder, 
renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra. Bladder cancer alone accounts for 90% of UC, with approximately 
550,000 new cases and 200,000 deaths attributed to bladder cancer worldwide each year. In Europe, 
an estimated 151, 297 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in 2012. In 2012, there were 52 
395 deaths from bladder cancer with an annual crude mortality rate of 7.1/100 000. Approximately 
70% of patients with bladder cancer are >65 years of age. (Bellmunt et al, 2014). The incidence of 
bladder cancer has remained unchanged over the last 25 years. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Bavencio is indicated as monotherapy for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) whose disease has not progressed with first-
line platinum-based induction chemotherapy. 
Management 
Platinum-based regimens are the standard-of-care first-line treatment for patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (aUC) and result in median OS ranging from 9-14 months 
(De Santis et al, 2012; Calabro et al, 2009). Despite initial high response rates, durations of PFS and 
OS are limited because of emergent chemotherapy resistance. Further, severe side effects limit long-
term use of current chemotherapy agents. Following successful first-line treatment, patients are 
typically managed with BSC until disease progression. Most patients will experience disease 
progression within 9 months after the initiation of treatment (von der Maase et al, 2005).  
Recently approved PD-L1 inhibitors are new systemic therapies for aUC, both for 1L treatment in 
cisplatin-ineligible patients for patients with tumours expressing ≥ 5% PD-L1 and for patients 
experiencing disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1-status. 
Galsky et al evaluated PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab as a maintenance treatment versus placebo in a 
Phase 2 study in patients with metastatic UC (mUC) following first-line treatment. PFS according to 
irRECIST was significantly longer in patients randomized to pembrolizumab versus placebo (log-rank 
p=0.038; Galsky et al, 2019). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Avelumab is a human Ig G1 mAb directed against PD-L1, which is expressed by tumour cells, as well 
as by a number of immune cell types. Avelumab binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between 
PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumour 
CD8+ T-cells, resulting in the restoration of a cytotoxic T-cell response. In vitro, avelumab is capable 
of stimulating an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against PD-L1-positive tumour

cells. 
Approved indications: 
•  Bavencio is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). 
•  Bavencio in combination with axitinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients 
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
EMA Scientific advice (SA) was received by the Applicant on  22 October 2015 
(EMEA/H/SA/2771/5/2015/II) 
The scope of the SA was to discuss the overall study design of Study B9991001. 
It was brought to the attention of the Applicant the importance of PFS2 in the interpretation of a PFS 
benefit. In addition, the PD-L1-negative subgroup of patients was pointed out as important to support 
a MA claim in the entire population regardless of PD-L1-status. The applicant was advised to at least 
formulate hypotheses in the PD-L1-negative subgroup. 
Pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteur on 30 March 2020 
The pre-submission meeting concerned a discussion on the acceptability of study B9991001 results for 
approval of Bavencio as monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting of locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (aUC). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted with this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Avelumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), avelumab is exempt from the submission of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk 
to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the proposed dosing regimen in the current aUC submission, the following clinical 
pharmacology analyses and evaluations were provided based on data from avelumab PK and ADA data 
from study B9991001:    
•  An assessment of the popPK of avelumab in patients with aUC to estimate avelumab 
exposures.  This analysis employed the monotherapy avelumab steady-state popPK model 
from the previous submissions.   
• 
The justification of the 800 mg IV Q2W flat-dosing regimen in the aUC analysis population.  
•  Evaluation of exposure-response relationships of avelumab with key safety and efficacy 
endpoints. 
• 
The immunogenicity of avelumab where the incidence of ADA was evaluated (see section 
4.5.1).  Moreover, the influence of ADA on PK and safety was assessed. 
A full characterisation of the avelumab PK properties was provided in the original marketing 
authorisation application. A summary of the avelumab PK characteristics is provided below. 
Absorption 
Bavencio is for intravenous infusion only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 12/154 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The volumes of the central and peripheral compartments, according to a population PK analysis, were 
2.84 L and 1.21 L in the typical subject, respectively. The geometric mean Vss (calculated from 
individual V1 and V2 parameter values) for a subject receiving 10 mg/kg was 4.72 L. 
Elimination 
Following IV administration of a 10 mg/kg dose the mean clearance determined by non-compartmental 
analysis was 0.36 mL/h/kg. The corresponding mean half-life was 95 h (~4 days). From a population 
PK analysis, the estimated t½ was approximately 6 days in subjects receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 
weeks. According to population PK analysis, estimated mean maximal reduction from baseline CL was 
32% in the mMCC population and 28% in the head and neck population. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose-normalized Cmax and AUC0-336hr after first dose were approximately similar across 3 to 20 
mg/kg. Ctrough increased proportionally with doses between 10 to 20 mg/kg, but more than 
proportionally for doses between 1 to 10 mg/kg. 
Table 2 lists the single study contributing PK and ADA data in the aUC patient population. 
Table 2. Clinical Study Providing Clinical Pharmacology Data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 13/154 
 
 
 
 
 
Analytical methods  
Validated avelumab serum concentration analytical method and anti-drug antibody assay have been 
used. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Summary statistics of avelumab Ctrough and Cmax were provided for study B9991001. A population 
pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis across studies was conducted to characterise the PK of avelumab in 
the aUC population. The popPK analysis is further described below. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The present popPK analysis included PK data from patients with aUC in study B9991001 and used the  
based structural component of the pre-established steady-state popPK model (Modeling & Simulation 
PopPK Report, ver 1.0, March 2017, previously submitted).  
To derive summary measures of avelumab exposure, first the PK from study B9991001 was fit using 
the base structural component (including body weight by allometric scaling) of the pre-established 
steady-state popPK model. The population PK analysis dataset included avelumab PK data from the 
pooled studies (studies EMR100070-001, EMR100070-002, and EMR100070-003), with the addition of 
avelumab PK data in the first-line maintenance aUC analysis population (study B9991001, Arm A). 
Individual empirical Bayes estimates of avelumab PK parameters were generated for the aUC analysis 
population from this popPK model, and subsequently used for deriving both single-dose and steady-
state exposure metrics of Ctrough, Cmax, and AUC.  
As a pre-established steady-state popPK structural model was used, traditional covariate screening 
was not conducted because covariate effects have been characterized in the general solid tumour 
population.  However, study B9991001 specific covariate effects such as ADA and PD L1 ≥ 25% status 
(dichotomous, yes/no) were graphically explored and final model individual estimates of clearance 
were compared to evaluate their potential influence on avelumab PK.  
Outliers were identified in an initial NONMEM run as observations having an absolute conditional 
weighted residuals (CWRES) value exceeding 4. These were permanently excluded from subsequent 
analysis. 
Model adequacy and goodness of fit plots were assessed including scatterplots of observed 
concentrations versus population and individual predicted concentration, and scatterplots of conditional 
weighted residuals versus population predictions and versus time after dose.  
The popPK analysis was performed using NONMEM version 7.4.3 (ICON Development Solutions, 
Dublin, Ireland), and post-processing was conducted using R version 3.5.0 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
Results 
A total of 2,171 patients receiving avelumab were included in the population PK analysis; 1,827 
patients were from the avelumab monotherapy solid tumour popPK dataset previously reported and 
344 patients were from the current study B9991001 in which avelumab was administered as first-line 
maintenance therapy to patients with aUC. In total there were 15,392 PK records with measurable 
avelumab concentration, 4,566 of which were from the UC first-line maintenance population. In the 
Assessment report

344 patients with UC who received first-line maintenance treatment, 66 were ADA ever-positive and 
278 were ADA never-positive. A 15% higher baseline clearance in ADA ever-positive patients versus 
ADA never-positive patients is consistent with the trend seen in patients with renal cell carcinoma. A 
total of 187 patients had PD-L1-positive tumours, 137 had PD-L1-negative tumours, and 20 patients 
were missing PD-L1 status. The baseline demographics and continuous variables are presented in 
Table 3.

In study B9991001, mean and median trough and maximum concentrations for avelumab were plotted 
using a box whisker plot by cycle and day. Avelumab Ctrough (0H or prior to infusion) concentrations 
appeared to reach steady state at Cycle 2, the 3rd infusion of avelumab, and did not appear to increase 
over time (Figure 6). Study B9991001 employed the weight-based avelumab regimen of 10 mg/kg IV 
Q2W. 
Geometric mean avelumab Ctrough concentrations ranged from 22.2 µg/mL to 32.4 µg/mL between 
Cycle 1, Day 15 and the last planned collection on Cycle 13, Day 1. The variability in geometric mean 
Ctrough (as geometric coefficient of variation, %) ranged from 48.6% to 85.2%, with overlapping 
distribution of concentration over time. Geometric mean avelumab Cmax concentrations ranged from 
168.9 µg/mL to 222.8 µg/mL between Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 13 Day 1. The variability in geometric 
mean Cmax (as geometric coefficient of variation, %) ranged from 30.3% to 86.2%, with overlapping 
distribution of concentration over time.

Table 6. Summary of Avelumab Exposure Metrics 
According to the population PK analysis, the geometric mean (95% CI) baseline CL of avelumab in the 
aUC population from study B9991001 was 0.0264 L/h (0.0256-0.0272), which was consistent with the 
baseline CL estimated with the previous pooled dataset of 0.0278 L/h (0.0274-0.0281). A comparison 
of avelumab baseline CL is represented in Figure 7. The change in CL over time of <5% in the aUC 
population indicates no change in avelumab clearance over time in patients with aUC.

Flat-dose justification 
The previous popPK model from avelumab monotherapy treatment of patients with solid tumours was 
used to derive single-dose and steady-state avelumab exposure metrics of AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough 
(Modeling and Simulation PopPK Report, version 1.0 March 2017, previously submitted). This previous 
popPK model utilized data from the pooled PK database of 1827 patients with solid tumours where the 
median baseline body weight was 70.6 kg (range: 30.4 to 204 kg). The simulated exposures for the 
800 mg Q2W flat-dosing regimen from the previous popPK model served as the reference dataset and 
was imported into this current analysis.  
For the first-line maintenance aUC analysis population, the same exposure metrics were derived from 
the final popPK model individual parameter estimates, and the predicted avelumab exposures were 
plotted alongside the exposure references of the previously simulated 800 mg Q2W exposure 
distributions. 
Graphical comparison of avelumab exposures in patients with aUC from study B9991001 to those 
reference exposures simulated from the popPK model in patients with solid tumours with flat-dosing 
regimen are shown below in the form of boxplots for AUC at steady state (AUCtau, ss) (Figure 10) and 
Ctrough at steady state (Ctrough, ss) (Figure 11). The exposures estimated in the first-line maintenance 
aUC analysis population were overlapping with those reference simulations presented previously for 
the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen and the 800 mg Q2W flat dosing regimen from patients with various solid 
tumours.

Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
The population PK/PD exposure- efficacy analysis, included data from patients with aUC in study 
B9991001 randomized to Arm A and used the derived avelumab exposure metrics from the popPK 
analysis. 
The efficacy endpoint analyzed in the exposure-response analyses was overall survival (OS) in patients 
randomized to Arm A of study B9991001, irrespective of PD-L1 expression on their tumours (N=350) 
and in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (N=189). The definition for OS is the same as that for the

analysis of clinical efficacy per study statistical analysis plan as reported in the CSR for B9991001.  
Figure 12 shows the OS for patients in Study B9991001. The left panel shows the OS for all 
randomized patients by treatment Arm (avelumab+BSC Arm (red) versus BSC Arm (blue)), and the 
right panel shows the OS for patients in the avelumab+BSC Arm of study B999100 stratified by 
avelumab exposure quartiles (Cycle 1 Day 15 trough concentration): quartile 1 red, quartile 2 blue, 
quartile 3 green, and quartile 4 purple). 
Figure 12. OS for Patients in Study B9991001 Irrespective of PD-L1 Expression. 
The exposure-efficacy data were evaluated using time-to-event analyses where the available data were 
fit to a survival function.  
In order to minimize the potential impact of post-treatment effects on avelumab PK, avelumab single-
dose exposure metrics (CL, AUC, Ctrough, and Cmax, and dose amount) were first evaluated in univariate 
analyses to assess the potential influence on the survival function. 
A log-normal distribution best described the OS data based on likelihood ratio test and visual 
inspection of diagnostic plots. Avelumab single-dose Cycle 1 Day 15 Ctrough, using a power model, was 
identified as the most significant exposure metric in patients with aUC randomized to Arm A, 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression. The final model parameter estimates are presented in Table 8.

Exposure-Safety Analysis 
The population PK/PD exposure-safety analysis included data from patients with aUC in Study 
B9991001 and used the derived avelumab exposure metrics from the popPK analysis described above. 
The safety analysis included all patients with aUC from study B9991001 who received at least one dose 
of avelumab. The analysis captured all types of adverse events (AEs) that occurred at least once in 
each patient. The safety event endpoints that were assessed were TEAEs Grade ≥ 3, irAEs Any Grade, 
and IRRs Any Grade. All AE grades were derived using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 definitions. For 
each type of safety event, patients were classified as experiencing the AE in the applicable 
severity/Grade category at least once during the duration of the study, or never experiencing the AE. 
The incidence of all selected AEs endpoints is presented in Table 9. 
Table 9. Incidence of Reported Safety Endpoints 
A base model was developed for each of the safety endpoints using a logistic regression model. 
Univariate screen of avelumab exposures of AUCtau,sd, Ctrough,sd, Cmax,sd, and Ctrough,ss was performed to 
determine the exposure parameter with the largest change in deviance. The chosen exposure

parameter was then selected for incorporation into the base model. The full model was comprised of 
the base model and all covariates of interest in scope. Covariates of interest included patient 
demographics, laboratory parameters, and disease-related values. Covariates were assessed for 
skewedness and collinearity and if two covariates were highly correlated (defined as |r| ≥ 0.6), only 
one was selected for multivariate analysis based on clinical relevance. The final model included the 
avelumab exposure metric along with any covariate effects on regression parameters that were 
retained during the backward elimination step using a threshold of α< 0.01. Model adequacy and 
goodness of fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.  Model predictive performance was based 
on the c-index (or area under the ROC curve). 
The safety analysis was performed in R by binomial logistic regression using the glm function. R 
version 3.5.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was also used for data 
processing, all modeling analyses, post-processing, and generation of figures and tables. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Grade ≥ 3 
The final model for TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 included avelumab Cmax,sd (based on the largest change in 
deviance, p=0.07) and baseline hemoglobin. A relatively flat exposure-response relationship was 
observed, where the predicted probabilities of TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 appear greater in patients with aUC 
with high Cmax,sd. Predicted probabilities of TEAE Grade ≥ 3 as a function of Cmax,sd and separated by 
median HGB (11.78 g/dL) are shown in Figure 13. For the 5th to 95th percentiles of Cmax,sd (140.9-
291.5 µg/mL), the probabilities of TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 ranged from 0.560-0.675 for patients with 
baseline hemoglobin ≤ 11.78, and 0.314-0.404 for patients with baseline hemoglobin >11.78. The 
correlation between baseline hemoglobin and predicted probabilities of TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 is expected.

The final model for IRRs Any Grade included AUCtau,sd (based on the largest change in deviance, 
p=0.003). No other covariates were included based on backwards elimination threshold of α<0.01. An 
inverse exposure-response relationship was found, where the predicted probabilities of IRRs Any Grade 
are higher in patients with aUC with lower avelumab AUCtau,sd (Figure 14). This is likely confounded by 
dose interruptions as all of the patients who experienced a dose interruption when receiving the first 
infusion also had AUCtau,sd values below the population median (the range of exposures in these 8 
patients is represented by the pink shaded region in Figure 14). Therefore, based on the shallow 
relationship and the direction of the effect, it is not considered meaningful.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The avelumab PK in the aUC population was mainly evaluated through population PK. A previously 
submitted avelumab PK model (in the mMCC submission), based on several solid tumour indications, 
served as the basis of the popPK analysis in the aUC population. This approach is accepted and of 
note, the approach was also applied in the aRCC submission. The model development and the 
population PK model results are endorsed.  
Overall, the PK of avelumab in the aUC population is similar to the avelumab PK in solid tumours. 
Exploratory graphical assessment of observed concentration as well as the population PK analysis, 
indicate that there is no change in avelumab clearance over time in the aUC patient population. The 
population PK parameters in the aUC population were consistent to the previous avelumab PK model. 
Furthermore, patient population specific covariates, ADA and PD-L1 status, do not seem to have a 
relevant effect on avelumab PK in the aUC population. 
Flat-dose justification 
The flat-dose justification is mainly based on the comparison between the expected (simulated) 
exposure range given the 10 mg/kg dose and the 800 mg flat-dose. In general, this approach is 
endorsed, and the objective is to ensure that the proposed flat-dose regimen results in a similar 
exposure range as the 10 mg/kg dosing regimen with the underlying assumption that the avelumab 
safety and efficacy profile remains the same. The comparison between simulated exposure range given 
10 mg/kg Q2W or 800 mg Q2W, respectively, indicate that the 800 mg flat dose regimen in general 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 36/154 
 
 
 
 
results in slightly higher exposure than for the per kg dosing (for all exposure metrics). As expected, 
the body weight relationship is reversed, with the lowest exposures for the patients with the highest 
body weights and a higher exposure for low body weight. Nevertheless, the expected exposure levels 
are within the reference exposure range and the new dosing regimen is expected to result in similar or 
slightly higher exposure compared to the 10 mg/kg dosing regimen. Hence, the 800 mg flat dose can 
be accepted for all patients regardless of body weight. 
Exposure-response 
It is important to note that several factors may limit the interpretation of the E-R modeling results. 
First, the range of data used in the analysis was limited to a single dose level (10 mg/kg IV Q2W), 
resulting in a narrow range of exposure evaluated (single-dose Cycle 1 Day 15 Ctrough ranged from 0 
to 96 mg/L). In general, exposure-response analyses based on one dose level should be interpreted 
with caution since it is difficult to distinguish between effects of exposure and other variables that can 
confound the E-R relationship. Second, there was an imbalance of baseline health status across 
exposure quartiles, including more patients with ECOG=0 and higher body weight at baseline in higher 
exposure quartiles. As such, the E-R analyses should be considered exploratory only.  
A univariate screen of avelumab exposures of AUCtau,sd, Ctrough,sd, Cmax,sd, and Ctrough,ss was 
performed to determine the most informative exposure parameter. As such, no mechanistic 
consideration has been made in the choice of exposure metric. For the exposure-efficacy analysis, only 
exposure metrics based on concentration samples from the first cycle were used in the analysis. 
The exposure-OS results suggested that a higher exposure (Ctrough,sd) was associated with a higher 
probability of longer OS in the parametric survival models in patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression 
on their tumours and in patients with PDL1-positive tumours. The results are in line with the previously 
reported positive exposure-efficacy relationships for other indications of avelumab. 
Models for safety endpoints TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 and irAEs Any Grade showed relatively shallow 
relationships between avelumab exposure (Cmax, sd) and safety events. The inverse relationship of 
avelumab AUCtau, sd and IRRs Any Grade is likely confounded by other factors, such as dose 
interruptions, hence the exposure cannot be considered an independent variable for infusion related 
response. Thus, the exposure-IRR relationship is not considered meaningful. In all models, ADA status 
and PD-L1 status were tested as covariates, but they were not significant for any safety endpoint and 
thus no associations were detected 
Overall, the exposure-response relationships for safety endpoints were similar to those estimated 
previously for avelumab administered as monotherapy in patients with solid tumours and in 
combination with axitinib in patients with aRCC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the clinical pharmacology documentation regarding the aUC indication is supported. 
Overall, the avelumab pharmacokinetics, PKPD and immunogenicity in the UC patient population is 
similar to what has been previously reported for solid state tumours and the aUC indication. The flat 
dose posology can be accepted.

Determination of PD-L1-status 
The IUO-labelled VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., a member of the 
Roche Group) has been analytically validated in UC at a defined cut-off. For the purpose of this study, 
PD-L1 status is considered high if any of the following are met:  ≥25% of tumour cells exhibit 
membrane staining; or, ICP >1% and tumour-associated immune cells with staining (IC+) ≥25%; or, 
ICP = 1% and IC+ = 100%. PD-L1 status is considered low/negative if none of the above criteria for 
PD-L1 high status are met. If PD-L1 status is interpreted as high the tumour will be defined as PD-L1-
positive; PD-L1 low/negative status will be defined as PD-L1-negative. 
Treatments 
•  Avelumab plus BSC; avelumab 10 mg/kg administered as 1-hour IV infusion Q2W 
•  BSC alone 
BSC was prescribed and/or administered per current treatment practices at each investigational site 
and per individual patient needs and could include treatment with antibiotics, antiemetics, nutritional 
support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal symptom control and pain management (including 
palliative radiotherapy), etc. BSC did not include any active anti-tumour therapy.  
In order to mitigate infusion-related reactions, premedication with an antihistamine and with 
paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to the first 4 infusions of 
avelumab was mandatory (for example, 25-50 mg diphenhydramine and 500-650 mg paracetamol 
[acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent). Premedication should be administered for subsequent 
avelumab doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. The 
premedication regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as 
appropriate, provided it does not include systemic corticosteroids 
For avelumab, no dose modifications were permitted in this study, but next infusion may be omitted 
based on persisting toxicity. 
Treatment was to be continued until confirmed disease progression as assessed by BICR or 
unacceptable toxicity. Before amendment 4, in the absence of clinical deterioration, it was stipulated 
that the patient should remain on treatment until progression was confirmed by BICR at least 4 weeks 
after the first diagnosis of progression. However, avelumab could be continued at the investigator’s 
discretion after discussion with the sponsor if the following criteria were met:  
•  Absence of clinical signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) of disease 
progression; 
•  No decline in ECOG PS; 
•  Absence of rapid disease progression evident in radiographic imaging; 
•  Absence of progressive tumour at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 41/154 
 
 
 
Patients could be eligible for re-treatment at the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with 
the sponsor’s medical monitor if the following criteria were met:  
1) no cancer treatment was administered other than BSC since the last dose of avelumab, 
2) the patient did not meet the safety withdrawal criteria,  
3) the trial was still open. 
Drug-related adverse reactions (excluding infusion-related reaction/hypersensitivity and immune-
related AE) of Grade 3 severity required avelumab to be withheld until recovery to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline. Infusion -related reactions and irAEs were handled in agreement with 4.4 in SmPC.  
Duration of on-treatment period was for safety endpoints defined as:  
•  Avelumab plus BSC:  time  from  the  first  dose  of  study treatment through  minimum  (30  
days  +  last  dose  of study treatment, start day of new anti-cancer drug therapy –   1 day) 
•  BSC: time from Cycle 1 Day 1 through minimum  (30 days + end date of BSC, start day of new 
anti-cancer drug therapy – 1 day) 
The MAH have proposed a different dosing regimen compared to what was used in the trial. The 
weight-based dosing regimen for avelumab (10 mg/kg IV Q2W) used in pivotal Phase 3 Study 
B9991001 was based on the dose identified in the Phase 1 Study EMR100070-001. 
The recommended dosing regimen for the treatment of mMCC and aRCC is 800 mg of avelumab, given 
by IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W, as summarized in the current SmPC. The proposed dosing 
regimen for avelumab for first-line maintenance treatment in patients with aUC is 800 mg IV Q2W.

Patient Reported Outcomes endpoints 
Patient reported bladder cancer symptom, functioning, global quality of life (QOL), and Time to 
Deterioration (TTD) using the NCCN-FACT FBlSI-18; and health status using the EQ-5D-5L. 
The patients were to complete the questionnaires at the clinic at Day1 of each cycle (Q4W), at 
EOT/withdrawal and day 30, 60 and 90 after last dose of study drug. For the NCCN-FACT FBlSI-18 
multi-item scales, the score may be imputed as the mean of the non- missing questions if at least half 
the questions in that scale are answered. For EQ-5D-5L, the entire score for that cycle is deemed 
missing if the answer to any one of the 5 dimensions is missing. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Biomarkers: Peripheral blood and additional tumour tissue biomarkers consisting of the levels of cells, 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or proteins that may be related to anti-tumour 
immune response and/or response to or disease progression on avelumab, such as genes related to 
IFN-γ or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to test the two primary populations in parallel. 
Overall type I error rate was maintained at or below 1-sided 0.025 by allocating 0.015 alpha to the OS 
comparison for all randomized patients and 0.01 to the OS comparison for patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours. The significance levels for each test also took into account the group-sequential nature of the 
design. 
Approximately 668 patients were to be randomized to the treatment arms using a 1:1 randomization 
stratified by best response to first-line chemotherapy (CR or PR vs SD) and site of metastasis (visceral 
vs non
visceral) at time of initiating first-line chemotherapy. It was estimated that at least 50% of the 
randomized patients would be determined to have PD
‑
L1
positive tumours. 
The sample size for this study was determined based on the following assumptions: 
‑
‑
• 
• 
• 
The median OS is 12 months for all patients and for patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours, who receive BSC alone after first-line chemotherapy. 
The median OS was assumed to be 17.1 months for all patients receiving avelumab 
plus BSC after first-line chemotherapy. 
The median OS was assumed to be 18.5 months for patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours, receiving avelumab plus BSC after first-line chemotherapy. 
•  5% drop-out rate for OS within each treatment arm. 
This corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 for all patients and 0.65 for patients with PD
L1-positive 
tumours under the exponential model assumption. 
‑
For all patients, a total of 425 OS events were required to have 93% power to detect a HR of 0.7 using 
a one-sided log rank test at a significance level of 0.015 and a 2-look group sequential design. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 45/154 
 
 
 
 
For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, a total of 219 OS events were required to have 80% power 
to detect a HR of 0.65 using a one-sided log rank test at a significance level of 0.01 and a 2-look group 
sequential design. 
The study was considered positive if the stratified log rank test for OS is significant at the respective 
adjusted levels at the interim or at the final analyses, for either of the two co-primary populations. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive avelumab plus BSC or BSC alone. 
Randomization using web based IRT was stratified according to:  
•  Best response to first-line chemotherapy (CR/PR vs SD), and  
•  Metastatic disease site (visceral vs non-visceral) at the time of initiating first-line 
chemotherapy.   
•  Site of metastasis was defined at the time of initiation of the first-line chemotherapy.  The 
“non-visceral” stratum includes patients with locally advanced disease as well as patients with 
only non-visceral disease. Patients with both visceral metastases and non-visceral sites of 
disease were categorized as “visceral”.

Study B9991001 was not blinded.  
In the evaluation of imaging, all independent reviewers were blinded to subject name, date of birth, 
subject initials, treatment arm and investigator site identifiers. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The analysis populations are defined as follows. 
Full Analysis Set: All randomized patients. This set was used for Efficacy, PRO, patient characteristics 
endpoints. 
Per Protocol Analysis Subset of FAS: Excludes from the FAS patients who did not receive the assigned 
treatment, patients with a baseline ECOG status 2 or higher, patients who did not meet inclusion 
criteria 1, 2, or 3, and patients who met exclusion criterion 1. This set was used for sensitivity analysis 
on the OS endpoint. 
Primary Analysis Overall Survival 
A 1-sided stratified log-rank test was used within each comparison at the interim and/or final analyses 
with the overall significance level preserved at its respective levels (1-sided 0.015 for all patients and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 47/154 
 
 
 
 
1-sided 0.01 for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours). OS time was summarized by treatment arm 
based on the FAS using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to 
compute the hazard ratios and the corresponding CIs. In order to account for the group-sequential 
design in this study, the RCI method was used to construct the 2
sided RCI for the hazard ratios. 
Sensitivity Analyses Overall Survival 
‑
Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore robustness of primary analyses; the primary analyses 
(p-value, HR and 95% CIs) were repeated with Per protocol population and unstratified analysis. 
Additionally, validity of proportional hazards assumptions was checked visually by plotting log(-
log(OS)) versus log(time) within each randomization stratum and also by plotting Schoenfeld residuals 
for the stratified Cox proportional regression model. If the plots showed large departures from 
proportional hazards, OS assessment was to be analysed based on RMST differences. 
Also, multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess and adjust the treatment effect 
for relevant baseline factors of potential prognostic impact. 
Progression-Free Survival 
A stratified log-rank test (1-sided) was used to compare the PFS time between the experimental arm 
and the control arm. PFS time was summarized by treatment arm based on the FAS using the Kaplan-
Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to compute the hazard ratios and the 
corresponding CIs. 
A summary of PFS by the BICR assessment versus investigator assessment was provided. Measures of 
discordance were used to evaluate potential bias. 
Objective Response 
OR was defined as BOR of confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 taking into account 
assessments performed from randomization until the first documentation of PD; only assessments 
performed on or before the start date of any further anti-cancer therapies were considered. ORR, the 
proportion of patients with OR, was calculated along with the 2-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-
Pearson method for each treatment arm. 
Patients with a CR after chemotherapy could only have a BOR of NE or PD after randomization. 
A summary of BOR and OR by BICR assessment versus investigator assessment is provided along with 
concordance rates. Difference in concordance rates between treatment arms was used to evaluate 
potential evaluation bias. 
Interim Analysis 
Two analyses were planned for OS: 
1)  the IA, after all patients have been randomized, at least 315 of all randomized patients have 
died (74% of the target number of OS events for the ‘all patients’ population), and at least 146 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours have died (approximately 66.7% of the total OS events 
expected in the ‘patients with PD-L1-positive tumours’ population); 
2)  the final analysis after at least 425 of all randomized patients and at least 219 patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumours have died, and the last patient randomized in the study has been 
followed for at least 12 months after randomization. 
To protect the integrity of the study and to preserve the type I error rate, a fraction of α for efficacy 
was planned to be spent at the IA and accounted for in the overall type I error rate (if the IA was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 48/154 
 
 
 
performed exactly at the planned number of OS events, α spent at IA is 0.005 for all patients and 
0.002 for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours). The significance levels for the interim and final 
efficacy analyses of OS are determined by using the Lan-DeMets procedure with an O’Brien-Fleming 
stopping boundary. The overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of OS were preserved at (1-
sided) 0.015 for all patients and 0.01 for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. 
The goals of the IA were to allow early stopping of treatment arm(s) for futility or efficacy and to 
potentially adjust the sample size. The study would have met its primary objective if the experimental 
arm was statistically significantly superior to the control arm for either one of the coprimary 
populations, either at the time of the IA or at the time of the final analysis.  
Since the observed number of events at the IA was not exactly equal to the planned number of events, 
the efficacy and futility boundaries were determined based on the actual number of observed events 
using the pre-specified α-and β-spending functions.

Recruitment 
The first patient was recruited in May 2016 (first subject visit 28 April 2016) and the last patient was 
recruited in June 2019. Data cut-off date for pre-specified interim analysis was 21 October 2019.  
Patients were enrolled among 231 sites in 29 countries. The number of patients enrolled and 
randomized per country are summarized in descending order: 
Spain 110, France 85, Japan 73, Italy 62, Australia 59, Republic of Korea 45, Greece 25, Belgium 24, 
Denmark 23, Taiwan 21, United Kingdom 19, United States 19, Russian Federation 17, Canada 15, 
Netherlands 15, Brazil 13, New Zealand 12, Serbia 10, Israel 7, Mexico 7, Norway 7, Sweden 7, India 
6, Portugal 6, Poland 5, Argentina 4, Hong Kong 2, Czech Republic 1, Hungary 1.   
The median duration of follow-up at the interim analysis for OS for all randomized patients was 19.6 
months and 19.2 months for patients in the avelumab plus BSC arm and BSC alone arm, respectively. 
For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, the median duration of follow-up for OS was 18.3 months 
and 20.0 months for avelumab plus BSC arm and the BSC alone arm, respectively.

Conduct of the study 
Tumour assessments 
For all patients, anti-tumour activity will be assessed through radiological tumour assessments 
conducted at baseline (including chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT or MRI scans), at 8 weeks after 
randomization, then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year from randomization, and every 12 weeks 
thereafter until documented disease progression as assessed by BICR regardless of initiation of 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Additional radiological tumour assessments should also be conducted 
whenever disease progression is suspected (e.g., symptomatic deterioration).

Clarifications to the protocol were made, inclusion criteria regarding requirements for tumour tissue 
were modified, alternate methods for estimating creatinine clearance was added to the inclusion 
criteria 11, exceptions for exclusion criteria for persisting toxicity related to prior treatment and 
resected prostate cancer was added, AE collection period were extended, a higher eligibility limit for 
AST and ALT elevations in patients with liver metastases was added and the analysis of disease control 
was modified.  
Amendment 4, 28 March 2019  
Clarifications to the protocol were made, the exploratory endpoint of irRECIST was removed and 
associated elements were revised or removed accordingly and management of avelumab toxicity was 
updated to reflect current standards.  
Amendment 1 and 2 were made before the first patient was recruited.  
Protocol deviations 
At least 1 potentially important protocol deviation (PIPD) was reported in 38.9% of all randomized 
patients (Table 13). The protocol deviation category with the highest frequency pertained to deviations 
from inclusion/exclusion criteria (12.0% in the avelumab plus BSC arm and 20.0% in the BSC alone 
arm). There were 9.6% patients with a PIPD associated with randomization in the IRT system under 
the wrong stratification value (Table 13).

The denominator to calculate percentages is N, the number of subjects in the full analysis set within each treatment group.  
Baseline is defined as the last assessment on or prior to randomization for subjects randomized but not dosed, and the last 
assessment on or prior to first dose of  
study treatment for subjects randomized and dosed.  
[1] n is the number of subjects with non-missing age. Age at Screening (years) = (date of given informed consent - date of birth 
+ 1)/365.25.

The denominator to calculate percentages is N, the number of subjects in the full analysis set within each treatment group.  
Baseline is defined as the last assessment on or prior to randomization for subjects randomized but not dosed, and the last 
assessment on or prior to first dose of study treatment for subjects randomized and dosed.  
[1] n is the number of subjects with non-missing age. Age at Screening (years) = (date of given informed consent - date of birth 
+ 1)/365.25.

Outcomes and estimation 
Data from two data cut-offs are presented for the primary endpoint, overall survival; the pre-specified 
interim analysis (data cut-off date 21 October 2019), and an updated analysis performed at the 
request of the Agency (data cut-off date 19 January 2020). For all other endpoints only the interim 
analysis data cut-off date is used. 
Primary endpoint of OS in co-primary analysis populations - all subjects and subjects with 
PD-L1-positive tumours 
The primary endpoint OS (21 Oct 2019) was statistically significant improved for all patients (n=700) 
assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC (stratified HR 0.69; 95% CI 
0.556, 0.863; 1-sided p-value 0.0005).  The median OS was 21.4 months (95% CI: 18.9, 26.1) in the 
avelumab plus BSC arm, and 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.9, 17.9) in the BSC arm. In patients with PD-
L1-positive tumours (n=358) a statistically significant improvement in OS was also demonstrated for 
patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC (stratified HR 0.56; 
95% CI: 0.404, 0.787; 1-sided p value 0.0003). The median OS was not reached (95% CI: 20.3 
months, not reached) in the avelumab plus BSC arm, and was 17.1 months (95% CI: 13.5, 23.7) in 
the BSC arm.  
For all randomized patients, the median duration of follow-up for OS was more than 19 months and 
similar for both treatment arms.

Updated OS data 
A non pre-specified OS update was requested based on data from the safety database lock 19 January 
2020, 90 days following the cut-off date of 21 October 2019.  
For all randomized patients, the median duration of follow-up for OS was 21.9 months and 21 months 
for patients in the avelumab plus BSC arm and BSC alone arm, respectively. For patients with PD-L1-
positive tumours, the median duration of follow-up for OS was 19.9 months and 21.9 months for 
patients in the avelumab plus BSC arm and BSC alone arm, respectively.  
The updated OS data is similar to the OS from the interim analysis and confirms the conclusions drawn 
from the interim analysis.  
The updated OS-data with an additional 90 days of follow-up with cut-off date 19 January 2020 
rendered a median OS for all patients treated with avelumab and BSC of 22.1 months (95% CI 19.0, 
26.1) and for patient treated with BSC 14.6 months (95% CI 12.8, 17.8) and HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.564, 
0.862; 2 sided p value 0.0008). For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours the updated median OS was 
NE (95% CI 20.6, NE) for patients treated with avelumab and BSC and 17.5 months (95% CI 13.5, 
31.6) for  patients treated with BSC alone, HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.439, 0.833; 2 sided p value 0.0019).  
OS for patients with PD-L1-negative patients was an exploratory analysis and part of the subgroup 
analysis. OS for patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours was not a prespecified endpoint. Using the 
updated OS-data with an additional 90 days of follow-up with cut-off date 19 January 2020, the 
median OS for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours was 18.9 months (95% CI 13.3, 22.1) for 
patients treated with avelumab and BSC and 13.4 months (95% CI 10.4, 17.3) for patients treated 
with BSC alone, HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.603, 1.131). For patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours the 
updated median OS was 20.1 months (95% CI 10.6, NE) for patients treated with avelumab and BSC 
and 13.0 months (95% CI 9.6, NE) for patients treated with BSC alone, HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.306, 
1.550). The subgroup of patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours was small and hence no firm 
conclusions have been drawn from the data. However, data is presented for completeness.

OS in subgroups 
Subgroup analysis of OS for all patients and for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours display no 
detrimental effect in any subgroup of reasonable size.

Subgroup analysis of OS for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours (data not shown) generally present 
with HR of ≤1, albeit with large confidence intervals due to small patient samples and more 
heterogeneity compared to the PFS subgroup results.

All randomized patients (including patients with CR following first-line chemotherapy) were included in 
the analysis of objective response (refer to study B9991001 SAP Section 6.2.2.3). For patients with no 
evidence of disease, the BOR can only be NE or PD, which is different from patients without 
measurable disease as the latter can also have BOR of CR or non-CR/non-PD. Subgroup analyses 
including only patients with measurable tumours at baseline were performed.  
Among the 78 patients with measurable disease by BICR at baseline with PD-L1-positive tumours 
treated with avelumab plus BSC, 7.7% achieved CR (BICR), 10.3% PR and 24.4% SD and 48.7% 
displayed PD. For the 78 patients treated with BSC, 1.3% achieved CR, 1.3% PR and 29.5% SD and 
56.4% displayed PD. Among the 77 patients with measurable disease by BICR at baseline with PD-L1-
negative tumours treated with avelumab plus BSC, 1.3% achieved CR (BICR), 6.5% PR and 31.2% SD 
and 55.8% displayed PD. For the 62 patients treated with BSC, 0% achieved CR or PR and 22.6% SD 
and 64.5% displayed PD.

Overall Response and objective responses are higher in patients with PD-L1-expression. Very few 
patients in the Avelumab+BSC arm (5.8%) with PD-L1-negative tumours had an objective response 
and no patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours. Due to the low number of responses an assessment of 
duration of the responses cannot be made.

Follow-up anti-cancer therapies  
The majority of patients, regardless of PD-L1 tumour status, reported at least one type of follow-up 
anti-cancer therapy. However, follow-up anti-cancer drug therapies were more common among 
patients treated with BSC in patients with both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumours. 6.3% of 
patients in the avelumab plus BSC arm were treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor whereas 43.7% of 
the patients in the BSC arm were treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

Over 90% of all randomized patients filled in the FB1SI-18 and this was similar in all groups. The 
proportion of patients completing the whole form was more variable and in general around 60% 
answered all questions during the treatment period and around 40% during the follow up phase in the 
FAS. It should be noted that not all items of FBlSI are required to be completed for scoring and one 
item was only applicable for male patients. 
Time to deterioration (TTD) was defined as ≥3-point decrease from baseline FB1SI-DRS-P for 2 
consecutive assessments (death and progression were not considered as a deterioration event). The 
HR for TTD in all randomized patients was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.901, 1.768). Median TTD was not reached 
in the avelumab plus BSC arm (95% CI: 13.9 months, not reached) and 13.8 months in the BSC alone 
arm (95% CI: 12.9 months, not reached). The HR for TTD in all randomized patients with PD-L1-
positive tumours was 1.51 (95% CI: 0.946, 2.401). Median TTD was not reached in the avelumab plus 
BSC arm (95% CI: 9.3 months, not reached) and 28.5 months in the BSC alone arm (95% CI: 13.7 
months, not reached).  
The proportion of answered EQ-5D-5L forms were greater than 90% for the majority of the treatment 
periods and also the proportion of fully completed forms were high, generally greater than 90%. At the 
end of treatment, the proportion of completed forms where at least one question was answered was 
around 80% and the proportion of fully completed forms just under 80%. For the follow up period, the 
proportion of forms where at least one question was answered was between 50-70% and also the 
proportion of fully complete forms was between 50-70%.  
The results of the FB1SI-18 and EQ-5D-5L forms were similar between avelumab + BSC and BSC alone 
for all randomized patients and for the patients with PD-L1 positive tumours.

2.4.2.   Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant provided data from a single phase 3 study, study B9991001 (JAVELIN Bladder 100), to 
support the proposed use of avelumab as maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC. The rationale for conducting an open trial is acknowledged. Eligibility criteria are 
considered acceptable. Measures taken to maintain objectivity by independent reviewers are noted. 
Data provided are from the interim analysis that was to be performed after 315 deaths, all patients 
had been randomized and at least 146 deaths among patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. The final 
analysis was planned to be performed after at least 425 of all randomized patients and at least 219 
patients with PD-L1-positve tumours had died, and the last randomized patient has been followed for 
at least 12 months after randomization.  
700 patients were randomized, and the randomization was stratified by best response to first-line 
chemotherapy (CR or PR vs SD), and metastatic disease site (visceral vs non-visceral) at the time of 
initiating first-line chemotherapy.  
The primary objective of study B9991001 was to demonstrate the benefit of maintenance treatment 
with avelumab plus BSC versus BSC alone in prolonging OS in each coprimary aUC patient population: 
1) all randomized patients and 2) patients determined to have PD-L1 positive tumours. To analyse the 
PD-L1 positive tumours separately is also appropriate. However, it is of importance that the efficacy in 
the entire population is evident also for patients without PD-L1 positive tumours in order to 
convincingly establish that the positive benefit-risk ratio is detected also in this patient population. 
Secondary and exploratory objectives are considered acceptable. In general, the assumptions in the 
sample size calculations seem overall reasonable.

12.0% of the patients in the avelumab plus BSC and 20.0% in the BSC group did not meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. This is of concern and introduces uncertainty towards the integrity of the 
study. However, a sensitivity analysis has been performed considering actual strata. This is almost 
completely overlapping with the primary OS analysis with a slight moderation of the stratified analysis 
with no clinical relevance. The results were also similar when patients with the clinically most 
important protocol deviations were removed as a sensitivity analysis.    
The amendments introduced in the study protocol are overall acceptable, and they are not considered 
to have compromised the integrity of the study or been driven by knowledge of study results. 
Potential important protocol deviations occurred in 38.9% of the patients in the study. The protocol 
deviations were generally quite evenly distributed between the treatment arms. The high number of 
randomization and inclusion/exclusion deviations are concerning. However, a sensitivity analysis has 
been performed considering actual strata. This is almost completely overlapping with the primary OS 
analysis with a slight moderation of the stratified analysis with no clinical relevance. The results were 
also similar when patients with the clinically most important protocol deviations were removed as a 
sensitivity analysis. 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced across the treatment arms 
in all the randomized patients. 77.3% of the patients were male in total and the mean and median age 
was 67.5 and 69.0 years respectively. 60.6% of the patients had ECOG performance status of 0 at 
baseline. There are however more patients under 65 years of age in the avelumab plus BSC group. For 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, the age is more homogenous between the two groups, albeit a 
slight tendency towards a larger proportion of patients under 65 years of age appears also here in the 
avelumab +BSC arm. PD-L1 status was unknown in 14..0% patients in the BSC arm which is more 
than double the proportion of unknowns in the avelumab plus BSC treatment group. In both coprimary 
populations, approximately three-quarters of patients in each arm entered the study with a best 
response to first-line chemotherapy of CR or PR, and approximately one-quarter of patients entered 
with a best response of SD. The patients with CR and PR are evenly distributed between the treatment 
groups for the different PD-L1-statuses. It is noted that the proportion of patients with CR is lower for 
patients with PD-L1-negative tumours ((18.5%) compared to patients with PD-L1-positive tumours 
(31.6%). 
The choice of not randomizing for PD-L1-status introduced larger uncertainty in the interpretation of 
the results and a larger risk for non-comparable patient populations between treatment options.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For OS, results from two data cut-offs are available, including a requested later cut-off 90 days after 
the pre-planned interim analysis (19 January 2020), while the results from all other efficacy endpoints 
stem from the interim analysis (21 October 2019). 
Efficacy data are provided from the interim analysis for PFS (both BICR and INV), overall response, 
objective response, disease control rate and subgroup analyses of PFS and OS. In addition, data from 
two PRO instrumentshave been presented.  
The primary endpoint OS (21 Oct 2019) was improved in a statistically significant way in all patients 
(n=700) assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC (stratified HR 0.69; 
95% CI 0.556, 0.863; 1-sided p-value 0.0005). The median OS was 21.4 months (95% CI: 18.9, 
26.1) in the avelumab plus BSC arm, and 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.9, 17.9) in the BSC arm. In 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (n=358), a statistically significant improvement in OS was also 
demonstrated for patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 95/154 
 
 
 
(stratified HR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.404, 0.787; 1-sided p -value 0.0003). The median OS was not reached 
(95% CI: 20.3 months, not reached) in the avelumab plus BSC arm, and was 17.1 months (95% CI: 
13.5, 23.7) in the BSC arm. 
The updated OS-data (19 Jan 2020) with an additional 90 days of follow-up rendered a median OS for 
all patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC of 22.1 months (95% CI 19.0, 26.1) and for patients 
treated with BSC of 14.6 months (95% CI 12.8, 17.8) and HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.564, 0.862). For 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours the updated median OS was NE (95% CI 20.6, NE) for patients 
treated with avelumab plus BSC and 17.5 months (95% CI 13.5, 31.6) for the BSC patients, HR 0.60 
(95% CI 0.439, 0.833). The OS results from the later data cut-off date are very similar to the results 
presented from the planned data cut-off date. 
In all randomized patients, those assigned to avelumab plus BSC had a prolonged PFS (by BICR 
assessment per RECIST v1.1), compared with patients assigned to BSC with stratified HR 0.62 (95% 
CI: 0.519, 0.751; nominal 1-sided p value <0.0001). The median PFS for avelumab plus BSC was 
3.7 months (95% CI: 3.5, 5.5) and for BSC 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.7) in all randomized patients. 
In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, the median PFS for avelumab plus BSC was 5.7 months (95% 
CI: 3.7, 7.4) and for BSC 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.5) with stratified HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.431, 
0.728; 1-sided p-value <0.0001). 
OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours were exploratory analysis and part of the 
subgroup analysis. OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours (n=72) were not 
prespecified endpoints. In patients with PD-L1-negative tumours (n=270), the median OS (19 Jan 
2020) was 18.9 months (95% CI 13.3, 22.1) for patients treated with avelumab plus BSC and for BSC 
13.4 months (95% CI 10.4, 17.3), with a HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.603, 1.131). There were no signs of a 
detrimental effect on OS in patients with PD-L1-negative tumours treated with avelumab plus BSC 
compared to BSC. PFS by BICR assessment for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours was prolonged 
for patients treated with avelumab in combination with BSC (3.6 months (95% CI 1.9, 16.7)) 
compared to BSC (2.1 months (95% CI 1.9, 6.8), HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.474, 0.847)). Subgroup analysis 
of PFS for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours should be interpreted with caution weighing in the 
small sample size and the risk of chance findings. Generally, the different subgroups present with HR 
of ≤1 with wide confidence intervals suggesting no identified subgroup with a seemingly detrimental 
PFS. 
ORR was higher in patients treated with avelumab plus BSC compared to patients assigned to BSC, for 
all randomized patients and for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. The proportion of patients with 
PD-L1-negative tumours that achieved objective response was higher for the patients treated with 
avelumab in combination with BSC, but the absolute numbers are low with 8 patients (5.8%, 95% CI 
2.5, 11.0) achieving objective response. 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors were administered as subsequent anti-cancer drug treatments in a higher 
proportion of patients in the BSC alone arm compared with the avelumab plus BSC arm in all patients 
and in each PD-L1-strata. Few patients (6.3%) treated with avelumab plus BSC received PD-1 or PD-
L1 inhibitor as subsequent anti-cancer therapy while a considerable proportion (43.7%) of patients 
from the BSC arm were treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as subsequent anti-cancer therapy. The 
analysis of time to end-of-next-line treatment (as an approximation for PFS2) for all patients and in 
each PD-L1-strata do not imply a detrimental effect on time to end-of-next-line treatment. This 
supports the apparent lack of a detrimental effect of avelumab on OS for the patients with PD-L1-
negative tumours. 
Subgroup analysis of OS for all patients and for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours display no 
detrimental effect in any subgroup of reasonable size. Subgroup analysis of OS for patients with PD-

L1-negative tumours (data not shown) generally present with HR of ≤1, albeit with large confidence 
intervals due to small patient numbers and more heterogeneity compared to the PFS subgroup results. 
It is also notable that for the subgroups of PD-L1 negative patients where the HR for OS is ≥1, the HR 
for PFS is <1. 
The efficacy data from patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours are challenging to interpret due to very 
low patient numbers. However, no evident detrimental effect on PFS or OS is seemingly detected in 
patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours. 
A majority of the patients continued with anti-PD-L1 treatment after progression. The median number 
of infusions received after progression was 3.0 across all PD-L1-strata, the mean was 5.4 (SD 7.09) for 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours and 6.4 (SD 10.41) for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours. 
The posology proposed state that treatment should continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
We currently have no indication that the OS efficacy is driven by the post-progression treatment. 
PRO 
The results for the PRO NCCN/FACT Bladder Symptom Index (NFB1SI-18) and EQ-5D-5L) do not imply 
that addition of avelumab to BSC conferred a detrimental effect on the quality of life of patients. These 
results should however be interpreted with caution due to the open label study design and imputation 
of answers in the analyses for NFB1SI-18. The results from the EQ-5D-5L form do not suggest that the 
avelumab addition to BSC conferred a detrimental effect of the quality of life for the patients. However, 
due to the open-label study design the results are open to patient bias, conferring a degree of 
uncertainty.    
2.4.3.   Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the currently provided data, a benefit for the addition of avelumab as a maintenance 
treatment has been demonstrated in the overall population. Although this OS benefit is not solely 
driven by the PD-L1-positive tumour population, the benefit of the addition of avelumab to BSC for 
patients with PD-L1-negative tumours is less pronounced. Patients with PD-L1-negative tumours on a 
group level display a modest prolongation of PFS in combination with no display of detrimental effect 
on OS.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data are presented for the use of avelumab plus BSC vs. BSC as monotherapy for the first-line 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
who are progression-free following platinum-based chemotherapy (study B9991001). Safety data from 
study EMR100070-001 included two cohorts (secondary expansion n=44; efficacy expansion n=205) 
where patients with aUC had progressive disease and the majority having received 2 or more lines of 
prior therapy are also presented. Study B9991001 and study EMR100070-001 are not pooled as the 
MAH considers the populations to be different. Study EMR100070-001 enrolled heavily pre-treated 
patients whereas study B9991001 enrolled patients with aUC who had received only 1 line of 
chemotherapy without PD.  
Safety database cut-off date was January 19, 2020 (12 weeks after primary efficacy cut-off date). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 97/154 
 
 
 
The safety database includes data from 689 patients, who received any amount of study treatment in 
study B9991001 (344 patients treated with avelumab plus BSC; 345 in the BSC arm). The Pooled 
Safety Data that consists of data from 1738 patients treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W as a single 
agent (1650 patients with various solid tumours from study EMR100070-001, including the 
249 patients from the aUC cohorts, and 88 patients with mMCC from Part A of Study EMR100070-003 
with a data cut-off of 09 June 2016) are presented for reference. Study EMR100070-003, the pivotal 
study for the mMCC indication, is an open-label, multicentre, single arm study in patients with mMCC.  
The safety profile of avelumab has been described previously when used as monotherapy for mMCC. 
The general class safety profile for PD-L1-inhibitors is considered well known.

Patient exposure 
The median treatment duration in study B9991001 was 25.3 weeks (range: 2.0, 173.9) in the 
avelumab plus BSC arm and considerably shorter, 13.1 weeks (range: 0.1, 168.4) in the BSC alone 
arm (19 Jan 2020). The following results are presented with data from 21 October 2019 cut-off. Mean 
number of infusions with avelumab in study B9991001 was 18.4 (SD 16.26) with a wide interval for 
standard deviation. The median number of avelumab infusions was 11.0 (range 1.0, 80.0). 45.9% of 
the patients treated with avelumab experienced dose delays. Few patients had dose reductions which 
is to be expected with the study design not permitting dose modifications. 9.3% of the avelumab 
patients in study B9991001 had at least one infusion rate reduction of 50% or more. 6.4% had 4 or 
more infusion rate reductions. 4.7% had infusion interruptions.  
Patients with PD-L1-positive tumours were exposed to avelumab for longer time compared to patients 
with PD-L1-negative tumours.  
The duration of treatment is longer and cumulative dose is higher in study B99910001 compared to 
the reported safety set.

N is the number of subjects in the safety analysis set within each treatment group.  
[1] Duration of avelumab treatment is defined as Duration (weeks) = (last dose date of avelumab – first dose date of avelumab 
+ 14)/7.  
      Duration of BSC treatment is defined as Duration (weeks) = (end date of BSC – start date of BSC + 1)/7  
[2] Person exposure-100 years = Sum of duration of exposure (in days) to study drug for all patients / (100*365.25).  
[3] Cumulative dose (mg/kg) = sum of all doses (mg/kg) of avelumab.  
[4] Dose Intensity (mg/kg/cycle) = [Overall cumulative dose (mg/kg)] / [(intended duration of avelumab treatment 
(weeks)/cycle length]. Dose Intensity is calculated as mg/kg/4-week cycle for Study B9991001 and as mg/kg/2-week cycle for 
the Pooled Safety Population, therefore Dose Intensity for the Overall is not available. 
[5] Relative Dose Intensity (%) = 100 × [Dose Intensity (mg/kg/cycle)] / [intended dose (mg/kg/cycle)]  
The descriptive summary statistics are calculated based on n, the number of subjects who have received at least one dose of 
study drug.

[1] Dose delay is the difference between the actual time between two consecutive non-zero doses and the planned 
time between the same two consecutive non-zero doses. A delay of 1-3 days is not counted as a delay. 
[2] Dose reduction is defined as actual non-zero dose < 90% of the planned dose. 
[3] Infusion rate reduction is defined as decrease in the infusion rate by 50% or more compared to the first infusion rate. 
[4] An infusion interruption is defined as an infusion that is stopped and re-started on the same day. 
The denominator to calculate percentages is N, the number of subjects in the safety analysis set within each treatment 
group.

Adverse events  
Summary of Adverse events 
Nearly all patients reported AEs, as expected, with avelumab treatment. The proportion of patients 
that reported AE of grade 3 or higher was lower in study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety set, 
47.4% compared to 58.0% respectively.  
The frequency of each AE of grade ≥3 is mostly relatively low in study B9991001 and the pooled safety 
set. The most common AEs of grade ≥3 for patients in study B9991001 are urinary tract infection and 
anaemia. Generally, the frequency is lower with the exception of urinary tract infection and haematuria 
when comparing study B9991001 to the pooled safety set. The general frequency of AEs of any grade 
differs slightly from the pooled safety set in study B9991001 but does not raise serious concerns and 
the deviations go both ways.   
Exposure adjusted data does not indicate that treatment of the new suggested indication would confer 
a more serious AE profile. The incident rate per 100 patient months (IR) are similar or appear lower for 
study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety population for the overview of safety parameters 
(Table 46), most common AE (Table 51) with a few exceptions where the IR frequency is higher.

Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for evaluation of avelumab immunogenicity were collected from patients on Arm A 
within 2 hours before the start of the avelumab infusion on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycles 1 through 3 
and then on Day 1 of Cycle 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.   
Treatment-induced ADA incidence was 62 of 325 patients (19.1%) treated with avelumab with 43 
(13.2%) having persistent ADA response and 19 (5.8%) having transient response in study B9991001. 
Of the patients who were ADA positive at baseline (n=4, 1.2% patients), none had treatment-boosted 
ADA (Table 68).

Table 68. Summary of Subject ADA Categories - Immunogenicity Analysis Set Study 
B9991001 
Of the 62 patients with treatment-induced ADA, the median time to ADA positive value was 10.2 
weeks (range: 2.1, 35.7). The median duration seropositivity was 2.4 weeks (95% CI 0.1, 7.7). 
No effect of ADA status on avelumab PK was detected (see Pharmacokinetics section above). 
Adverse events by treatment-induced ADA vs ADA never-positive or baseline ADA positive status are 
summarized in Table 69. The percentage of patients reporting TEAEs was similar for treatment-induced 
ADA-positive patients (98.4%) and ADA never-positive or baseline ADA-positive patients (97.9%). The 
proportions of patient with reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (51.6% versus 46.5%), serious TEAEs (35.5% 
versus 26.2%), TEAEs leading to discontinuation of avelumab (17.7% versus 10.6%), and IRRs 
(27.4% versus 20.2%) were numerically higher in the treatment-induced ADA positive patients than in 
the ADA never-positive or baseline ADA positive patients, respectively; however, the comparison was 
limited by the overall low incidence of immunogenicity.

Table 69. Summary of Adverse Events, by Treatment-Induced ADA versus ADA Never-
Positive or Baseline ADA Positive - Immunogenicity Analysis Set Study B9991001 
A previously assessed ADA assay (aRCC indication) was used in the current analysis. The incidence of 
treatment induced ADAs in the UC population was 19.1%, which is slightly higher than in the aRCC 
population (14.6%) where the same ADA assay was used. It is, however, agreed that ADA formation 
does not seem to be influential for avelumab PK or safety in the UC population. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data to support the claimed extension of indication for bavencio as monotherapy for the 
first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) who are progression-free following platinum-based chemotherapy, are based on data 
from the interim analysis of the phase 3 study B9991001. The safety database for study B9991001 
consisted of 689 patients receiving any study treatment with avelumab plus BSC (n=344) or BSC 
(n=345). Safety database cut-off date was January 19, 2020 (12 weeks after CSR data cut-off date). 
The pooled safety data set for avelumab monotherapy consisted of patients from EMR100070-001 and 
study EMR100070-003, in total 1738 patients.  
The median treatment duration in study B9991001 was 25.3 weeks (range: 2.0, 173.9) in the 
avelumab plus BSC arm and considerably shorter, 13.1 weeks (range: 0.1, 168.4) in the BSC alone 
arm (19 Jan 2020). Patients with PD-L1-positive tumours are exposed to avelumab for longer time 
compared to patients with PD-L1-negative tumours. Mean and median exposure to avelumab is about 
double in study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety set.  
Adverse events were observed in nearly all patients treated with avelumab. Compared with only BSC, 
the incidence for AEs was higher in patients treated with avelumab. The difference is more pronounced 
for ARs of grade 3 or higher. AEs reported from study B9991001, which were considerably more 
common in the avelumab plus BSC arm, were irAEs and IRRs, which could be expected. In relation to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 134/154 
 
 
 
 
the pooled safety set, IRRs were similar as observed in study B9991001, but irAEs were more common 
in Study B9991001.  
The most commonly reported AE for patients in study B9991001 treated with avelumab plus BSC was 
fatigue, 17.7%. This was more common in the pooled safety set with 32.4%. The most frequent AEs 
were generally more common in study B9991001 for patients treated with avelumab plus BSC 
compared to only BSC.  There are no major differences between patients with PD-L1-positive tumours 
and the entire population in study B9991001.  
Overall, the majority of deaths was caused by disease progression in both the pooled safety set and 
study B9991001. The proportion was lower in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours compared to all 
other groups. Deaths caused by study treatment toxicity was higher in patients in study B9991001 
treated with avelumab plus BSC (0.6%) compared to the pooled safety population (0.2%). However, 
the absolute number of deaths assessed by the investigator to be due to study treatment is low and 
the reported cases display several confounding factors that do not support a clear relationship to study 
treatment.  
The frequency of deaths attributed to AEs not related to study treatment is lower (0.6%) in the 
avelumab plus BSC care arm compared to the pooled safety set (3.4%). The frequency of death 
related to unknown causes was the same in both treatment arms (1.7%) of study B9991001 and lower 
compared to the pooled safety population (4.8%). In the avelumab + BSC arm of study B9991001, all 
patients in the “Unknown” subgroup were diagnosed with disease progression, 3 out of 6 patients 
received some new anti-cancer therapy after avelumab, and in all patients the death occurred ≥3 
months after the last dose of avelumab. 
In conclusion, the frequency of deaths not attributed to disease progression in study B9991001 do not 
raise any serious new safety concerns for avelumab monotherapy treatment for the first-line 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
who are progression-free following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Serious AEs were less frequent or similar in study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety set overall 
and for all organ system except for “renal and urinary disorders” where the proportion of affected was 
doubled. For intra study comparison of serious AEs in study B9991001, serious adverse events are 
more common among patients treated with avelumab plus BSC, 27.9% compared to the BSC arm, 
20.0%. The similar incidence of serious acute kidney injury in both arms (1.7%) in study B9991001 
suggest that this, in part, can be attributed to the patient population. However, the incidence of 
serious acute kidney injury is similar also in the pooled safety set (1.6%). Overall, the profile of 
serious AEs in study B9991001 does not raise any concern. 
The proportion of patients that interrupted the treatment with avelumab was almost double for 
patients in study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety set, 40.7% compared to 20.9 %. The 
exposure adjusted analysis shows a slight increase for patients with AEs leading to interruption of 
avelumab treatment. Incidence rate per 100 patient months for study B9991001 was 6.1 compared to 
the pooled safety population 5.0. This is not as pronounced as the non-adjusted analysis. The 
proportion of patients that discontinued treatment was quite similar between the groups, 11.9% for 
the study B9991001 and 14.0% for the pooled safety set. Exposure adjusted analysis show a lower 
treatment (about half) discontinuation of avelumab in study B9991001 compared to the Pooled Safety 
Set (1.3 vs. 2.9). In conclusion, the dose interruptions and proportion of patients discontinuing 
avelumab treatment raises no new safety concerns. 
The most common irAEs categories in study B9991001 of any grade and with an incidence over 1% for 
patients treated with avelumab plus BSC were: immune-related endocrinopathies: thyroid disorders 
(12.2%), immune-related rash (10.2%), other immune-related adverse events: other (2.6%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 135/154 
 
 
 
immune-related pneumonitis (2.0%), immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction (1.7%), 
immune-related colitis (1.5%) and immune-related hepatitis (1.5%). The most common irAE 
categories of grade 3 and above and with an incidence over 1% in study B9991001 for patients treated 
with avelumab plus BSC was: immune-related rash (1.5%) and immune-related hepatis (1.5%). For 
the pooled safety population, the most common irAE categories of any grade and with an incidence 
over 1% were: immune-related endocrinopathies: thyroid disorders (5.6%), immune-related rash 
(5.2%), immune-related pneumonitis (1.2%) and immune-related colitis (1.5%). There was no irAE 
category of grade 3 and above with an incidence over 1% in the pooled safety set. 
IrAEs weremore common in study B9991001 for patients treated with avelumab plus BSC, 29.4% 
compared to 14.2% in the pooled safety set. There was also a higher frequency of irAEs of grade 3 and 
above (7.0% vs. 2.2%), irAEs leading to discontinuation (5.5% vs. 2.0%) and serious irAEs (4.7 % vs. 
2.5%). Generally, the irAE categories of all grades and 3 and higher were more common in study 
B9991001 compared to the pooled safety population or of similar frequency.1.4% of the patients in the 
BSC arm in study B9991001 reported irAEs, and 0.3% were of grade 3 and higher. The median time to 
onset of irAEs is highly variable. The resolution of irAEs differed between irAEs from 16.7% for immune 
related thyroid disorders to 100% for immune related adrenal insufficiency at the time of data cut-off. 
The exposure adjusted IR per 100 patient months of irAEs is higher in study B9991001 compared to 
the pooled population, 4.1 compared to 3.3However, this increase raises no major concern in relation 
to the benefit risk assessment. 
Overall, presented data do not imply that the safety profile would be markedly different in patients 
with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumours. 
The incidence of treatment induced ADAs in the UC population was 19.1%, which is slightly higher than 
in the aRCC population (14.6%) where the same ADA assay was used. The graphical analysis based on 
the population PK analysis does not indicate that ADA formation is influential for PK. Furthermore, the 
exposure-safety analysis did not indicate that ADA formation is a factor for the probability of adverse 
events. Thus, it is agreed that ADA formation does not seem to be influential for avelumab PK or safety 
in the UC population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of avelumab in the pivotal study B9991001 is similar, regardless of PD-L1-
status, to the previously reported safety profile of avelumab monotherapy. No new safety concerns 
were raised, and the safety profile is considered manageable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.0 is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 136/154 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 5.0 with the following content: The safety 
profile of Bavencio monotherapy in the new indication is comparable to the already established safety 
profile of avelumab monotherapy in other solid tumours. 
Therefore, no changes to the safety concerns, Pharmacovigilance plan or Risk minimisations measures 
are needed. 
Existing pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisations measures remain sufficient to address the risk 
of the product in all approved indications.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the Package 
Leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the Package Leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Bavencio (avelumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance and it is biological product that is authorised 
after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Final Indication: 
Bavencio is indicated as monotherapy for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are progression-free following platinum-
based chemotherapy. 
The aim of the maintenance therapy with avelumab is to extend the durability of the initial benefit of 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 149/154 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Platinum-based regimens are the standard-of-care first-line treatment for patients with aUC and result 
in median OS ranging from 9-14 months (De Santis et al, 2012; Calabro et al, 2009). Despite initial 
high response rates, durations of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are limited 
because of emergent chemotherapy resistance. Further, severe side effects limit long-term use of 
current chemotherapy agents. Following successful first-line treatment, patients are typically managed 
with best supportive care (BSC) until disease progression. Most patients will experience disease 
progression within 9 months after the initiation of treatment (von der Maase et al, 2005).  
Recently approved PD-L1 inhibitors are new systemic therapies for metastatic UC, both for first-line 
treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients for patients with tumours expressing ≥ 5% PD-L1 and for 
patients experiencing disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1-
status.  
Galsky et al evaluated PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab as a maintenance treatment versus placebo in a 
Phase 2 study in patients with metastatic UC following first-line treatment. PFS according to irRECIST 
was significantly longer in patients randomized to pembrolizumab versus placebo (log-rank p=0.038; 
Galsky et al, 2019).   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal trial for this application is study B9991001 (“JAVELIN Bladder 100”), a Phase 3, 
multicentre, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study of avelumab (MSB0010718C) 
plus BSC versus BSC alone as a maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma whose disease did not progress after completion of first-line platinum-containing 
chemotherapy. 
Primary objective was to demonstrate the benefit of avelumab plus BSC versus BSC alone in 
prolonging OS for patients with PD-L1 positive tumours and in all randomized patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary objective of OS is appropriate as it also would weigh in the answer to the question of 
whether it is preferable to use the treatment option PD-L1 following response to first-line 
chemotherapy treatment or save the option for use in later treatment lines. The proportion of patients 
receiving second line treatment with a PD-L1-inhibitor was considerably higher for patients receiving 
BSC as maintenance treatment, 43.7%, than for patients receiving avelumab plus BSC, 6.3%.  
For OS, results from two data cut-offs are available, including a requested later cut-off 90 days after 
the pre-planned interim analysis (19 January 2020), while the results from all other efficacy endpoints 
stem from the interim analysis (21 October 2019). 
The primary endpoint OS (21 October 2019) was statistically significant in all patients (n=700) 
assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC (stratified hazard ratio (HR) 
0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.556, 0.863; 1-sided p-value 0.0005). The median OS was 21.4 
months (95% CI: 18.9, 26.1) in the avelumab plus BSC arm, and 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.9, 17.9) 
in the BSC arm. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (n=358) a statistically significant OS was also 
demonstrated for patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC compared with patients assigned to BSC 
(stratified HR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.404, 0.787; 1-sided p -value 0.0003). The median OS was not reached 
(95% CI: 20.3 months, not reached) in the avelumab plus BSC arm, and was 17.1 months (95% CI: 
13.5, 23.7) in the BSC arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 150/154 
 
 
 
The updated OS-data (19 January 2020) with an additional 90 days of follow-up rendered a median OS 
for all patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC of 22.1 months (95% CI 19.0, 26.1) and for patients 
treated with BSC of 14.6 months (95% CI 12.8, 17.8) and HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.564, 0.862; 2 sided p-
value 0.0008). For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours the updated median OS was not evaluable 
(NE) (95% CI 20.6, NE) for patients treated with avelumab plus BSC and 17.5 months (95% CI 13.5, 
31.6) for the BSC patients, HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.439, 0.833; 2-sided p-value 0.0019). The OS results 
from the later data cut-off date are very similar to the results presented from the planned data cut-off 
date. 
In all randomized patients, patients assigned to avelumab plus BSC had a statistically significant PFS 
(by BICR assessment per RECIST v1.1), compared with patients assigned to BSC with stratified HR 
0.62 (95% CI: 0.519, 0.751; nominal 2-sided p value <0.0001). The median PFS for avelumab plus 
BSC was 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.5, 5.5) and for BSC 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.7) in all randomized 
patients. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, the median PFS for avelumab plus BSC was 5.7 
months (95% CI: 3.7, 7.4) and for BSC 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.5) with stratified HR 0.56 (95% 
CI 0.431, 0.728; 2-sided p-value <0.0001). 
OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours was an exploratory analysis and part of the 
subgroup analysis. OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours (n=72) was not a 
prespecified endpoint. In patients with PD-L1-negative tumours (n=270), the median OS (19 Jan 
2020) was 18.9 months (95% CI 13.3, 22.1) for patients treated with avelumab plus BSC and for BSC 
13.4 months (95% CI 10.4, 17.3), with a HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.603, 1.131). There were no signs of a 
detrimental effect on OS in patients with PD-L1-negative tumours treated with avelumab plus BSC 
compared to BSC. PFS by BICR assessment for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours was prolonged 
for patients treated with avelumab in combination with BSC (3.0 months (95% CI 2.0, 3.7)) compared 
to BSC (1.9 months (95% CI 1.9, 2.1), HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.474, 0.847). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy data from patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours are challenging to interpret due to very 
low patient numbers. However, no evident detrimental effect on PFS or OS is seemingly detected in 
patients with PD-L1-unknown tumours.  
Patients with PD-L1-negative tumours, on a group level, display a modest prolongation of PFS with 
avelumab plus BSC compared with BSC alone and no signs of a detrimental effect on OS. The OS 
subgroup analyses in patients with PD-L1-negative tumours generally present with HR of ≤1, albeit 
with large confidence intervals due to small patient samples and more heterogeneity compared to the 
PFS subgroup results. No conclusion can be drawn that any patient population display a detrimental 
effect on OS that would motivate an exclusion of this patient population from the indication. It is noted 
that for the subgroups where HR for OS is ≥1, the HR for PFS is <1.  
Due to the low number of patients with PD-L1-negative tumours achieving objective response rate 
(ORR) and also the lack of information regarding follow-up time for these responses, firm conclusions 
cannot be drawn. Hence, the duration of the response in PD-L1-negative tumours is uncertain. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nearly all patients treated with avelumab reported adverse event (AE), in line with the known safety 
profile. The proportion of patients that reported AE of grade 3 or higher was lower in study B9991001 
compared to the safety set, 47.4% compared to 58.9% respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3166/2021 
Page 151/154 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients that interrupted the treatment with avelumab was almost double for 
patients in study B9991001 compared to the pooled safety set, 40.7% compared to 20.9 %. The 
exposure-adjusted incident rate per 100 patient months AE analysis shows a slightly higher incident 
rate for patients with AE leading to interruption of avelumab treatment in study B9991001. Incidence 
rate per 100 patient months was 6.1 compared to the pooled safety population 5.0. This is not as 
pronounced as the non-adjusted analysis.  
The proportion of patients that discontinued treatment due to an AE was quite similar between the 
groups, 11.9% for study B9991001 and 14.0% for the pooled safety set. Exposure adjusted analysis 
incident rate per 100 patient months show a lower treatment (about half) discontinuation rate of 
avelumab in study B9991001 compared to the Pooled Safety Set (1.3 vs. 2.9). Immune-related 
adverse events (irAE) were more common in study B9991001 for patients treated with avelumab plus 
BSC, 29.4% compared to the pooled safety set where 14.2% presented with irAEs. The exposure 
adjusted incident rate per 100 patient months of irAEs is higher in study B9991001 compared to the 
pooled population, 4.1 compared to 3.3. However, the increase when analysed adjusted for exposure 
raises no major concern in relation to the benefit risk assessment. 
Most common cause of death, both in study B9991001 and the pooled safety set was disease 
progression. Deaths related to study treatment toxicity was 0.6% in study B9991001 compared to 
0.2% in the pooled safety set. Considering that avelumab in study B9991001 is used in a maintenance 
setting this increased rate of deaths related to study treatment toxicity could be of concern. However, 
the absolute number of deaths assessed by the investigator to be related to study treatment is low and 
the reported cases display several confounding factors that do not support a clear relationship to study 
treatment. The frequency of deaths not attributed to disease progression in study B9991001 does not 
raise new safety concerns for avelumab treatment in patients treated with avelumab plus BSC with 
advanced urothelial carcinoma that did not progress on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Compared to the pooled safety set an increased frequency of deaths was reported in study B9991001 
although the absolute numbers were low.  
In relation to the BSC patients, a considerably higher incidence of AE of grade 3 and above was 
reported along with the irAE increase and increase in serious AE compared to patients treated with 
avelumab plus BSC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.   Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The interim OS-analysis from study B9991001 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant prolonged OS of 7.1 months for all included patients and also for patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours. The updated OS-analysis demonstrated a prolonged OS of 7.5 months for all included 
patients. The benefit of the addition of avelumab to BSC for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours is 
less pronounced, nevertheless, patients with PD-L1-negative tumours, on a group level, display a 
modest increase of PFS and no signs of a detrimental effect on OS that would otherwise motivate 
exclusion of this patient population from the indication.   
Overall, the safety profile of avelumab in the pivotal study B9991001 is similar, regardless of PD-L1-
status, to the previously reported safety profile of avelumab monotherapy. No new safety concerns 
were raised, and the safety profile is considered manageable. 
3.7.2.   Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in all patients independent of PD-L1-status and the safety profile is 
manageable. Hence, the benefit-risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.   Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Exposure comparisons between the 10 mg/kg dosing and a flat 800 mg dose based on simulations 
from population PK models are the justification for the change of the posology to flat-dosing for the 
treatment of aUC patients. The benefit-risk balance for the 800 mg Q2W flat-dose posology is 
considered unchanged compared to the 10 mg/kg Q2W posology since the flat-dose exposure range is 
comparable to the weight-based dosing exposure range. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of avelumab is positive in the new sought indication.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include a new indication for Bavencio in the treatment as monotherapy for 
the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) who are progression-free following platinum based chemotherapy; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1 , 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 5.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. The MAH took also the occasion to 
include some editorial changes in the PI. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above. 
Summary 
Please refer to Scientific Discussion Bavencio-H-C-4338-II-0018.

Summary of the risk management plan
Summary of risk management plan for ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ADCETRIS. The RMP details important risks 
of  ADCETRIS,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
ADCETRIS's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ADCETRIS's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ADCETRIS should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ADCETRIS should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  ADCETRIS's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV 
HL in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD), relapsed or refractory CD30+ 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or following at least 2 prior 
therapies  when  ASCT  or  multiagent  chemotherapy  is  not  a  treatment  option;  treatment  of  adult 
patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT; treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and treatment of 
adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least 1 prior systemic therapy 
(see SmPC for the full indication). 
ADCETRIS is also indicated in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) 
for  adult  patients  with  previously  untreated  systemic  anaplastic  large  cell  lymphoma  (sALCL).  It 
contains brentuximab vedotin as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  ADCETRIS’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  the  ADCETRIS’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks
Important risks of ADCETRIS, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about ADCETRIS's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that may  affect  the  safe  use  of  ADCETRIS  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  ADCETRIS  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  ADCETRIS.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not  been established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on 
the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
The  safety  information  in  the  proposed  product  information  is  aligned  to  the  reference  medicinal 
product.
Important identified risk: Peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor)
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Nonclinical study data; adverse event reports from phase 1, 
2, and 3 clinical trials; and spontaneous adverse event 
reports from the post-marketing setting.
Risk factors and risk groups
Prior exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy regimens with 
subclinical nerve injury; history of diabetes or alcohol use; 
hypothyroidism.
Among lymphoma patients, disease-specific risk factors 
include paraneoplastic, vasculitic, or paraproteinemic 
neuropathies.
Risk minimization measures
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Section 4.8
SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 where there are 
recommendations regarding monitoring patients for 
symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, 
hyperesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, 
neuropathic pain or weakness) and the possibility of delaying 
or reducing the dose in patients who experience new or 
worsening neuropathy.

Important identified risk: Myelosuppression (including Neutropenia, Febrile Neutropenia, 
Thrombocytopenia and Anaemia)
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Nonclinical study data; adverse event reports from phase 1, 
2, and 3 clinical trials; and spontaneous adverse event 
reports from the post-marketing setting.
Risk factors and risk groups
Prior ASCT, chemotherapy, patients with neutropenia, 
decreased WBC and/or platelet count, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, or red blood cell counts at baseline.
The risk of febrile neutropenia is increased for patients with 
lower absolute neutrophil counts. The risk of febrile 
neutropenia in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy 
increases with duration of neutropenia and with degree of 
mucosal damage, (UpToDate.com, Overview of neutropenic 
fever syndromes, accessed 13 Mar 2013).
Thus, the incidence is often higher in patients receiving 
multiagent chemotherapy as the cumulative toxicities of 
multiple chemotherapeutics can increase both duration of 
neutropenia and mucosal damage. Other risk factors that 
may increase the likelihood of developing febrile neutropenia 
include advanced stage of underlying malignancy, older age, 
high body surface area, poor performance status, and poor 
nutritional status, (UpToDate.com, Use of granulocyte colony 
stimulating factors in patients with chemotherapy-induced 
neutropenia, and risk assessment of adults with 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, accessed 13 Mar 2013).
Risk minimization measures
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Section 4.8
SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 where there are 
recommendations for patients to have a full blood count prior 
to administration of each dose of brentuximab vedotin and 
for close monitoring of patients who develop neutropenia. If 
patients develop febrile neutropenia, they should be 
managed according to best medical practice. Dose delays 
should be considered in patients who develop neutropenia 
and growth factor support (G-CSF or GM-CSF) should be 
considered in subsequent cycles for patients who develop 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia in monotherapy with 
brentuximab vedotin. 
In combination therapy for the frontline treatment of HL, 
primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended for all 
patients beginning with the first dose

about the possibility of patients developing immediate and 
delayed IRRs including anaphylactic reactions and a 
recommendation that administration of brentuximab vedotin 
should either be interrupted or immediately and permanently
discontinued and appropriate medical therapy administered if 
an IRR or anaphylactic reaction occurs.
The SmPC also recommend restarting the infusion at a 
slower rate after symptom resolution and pre-medicating

medicine

ULN, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, or concurrent steroid 
use.
Risk minimization measures

Patients with allergy to brentuximab vedotin or excipients. 
Patients with chronic infection may be more prone to an 
immune response. Patients exposed to similar proteins may 
be at higher risk.
Risk minimization measures
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Section 4.8
SmPC Section 4.4, where there is a statement that a higher 
incidence of IRRs has been observed in patients with 
persistently positive ADAs relative to patients with

recommended that the infusion should be interrupted if 
patients develop IRRs.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Blitzima 
rituximab 
On 18 May 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Blitzima, 
intended for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The applicant for this 
medicinal product is Celltrion Healthcare Hungary Kft. 
Blitzima will be available as a 500 mg concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance of 
Blitzima is rituximab, a monoclonal antibody (ATC code: L01XC02) that binds specifically to the 
transmembrane protein CD20 found on both malignant and normal B cells. In NHL and CLL, this promotes 
destruction of malignant B cells and thus controls tumour growth. In GPA and MPA, it reduces the levels 
of B cells involved in their pathogenesis. 
Blitzima is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Mabthera 
(rituximab), which was authorised in the EU on 2 June 1998. Data show that Blitzima has comparable 
quality, safety and efficacy to Mabthera. More information on biosimilar medicines can be found here. 
The full indications are: 
“Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
Blitzima is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.  
Blitzima maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy. 
Blitzima monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma 
who are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
Blitzima is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisolone) chemotherapy.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
previously untreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Only limited data 
are available on efficacy and safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies 
including Blitzima  or patients refractory to previous Blitzima  plus chemotherapy. 
See section 5.1 for further information. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis 
Blitzima, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult 
patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA).” 
It is proposed that Blitzima be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare 
professional and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

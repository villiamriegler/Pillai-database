Scientific conclusions  
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR  for  Corlentor  and  Procoralan,  the 
scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
The  signal  “abdominal  symptoms  (including  abdominal  distension,  abdominal  discomfort,  abdominal 
pain,  abdominal  pain  lower,  abdominal  pain  upper)”  arose  from  spontaneous  reporting  due  to  the 
high  number  of  cases.  In  28  out  of  50  cases  there  was  a  positive  dechallenge;  and  in  4  out  of  51 
cases there was a positive rechallenge. In addition the time to onset was within one week for 17 of 
the cases which is indicative of a causal relationship. Ivabradine is already associated with abdominal 
complaints  such  as  constipation,  diarrhoea  and  nausea.  Therefore  based  on  the  evaluation  of  these 
spontaneous  reported  cases,  abdominal  pain  should  be  included  as  a  new  adverse  reaction  with  an 
uncommon frequency in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding abdominal pain, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On  the  basis  of  the  scientific  conclusions  for  Corlentor  and  Procoralan,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ivabradine is 
favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.  
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adult men 
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or 
without food. 
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried. It 
may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. 
The maximum dose frequency is once per day. 
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not 
recommended for continuous daily use. 
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of Tadalafil Lilly (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily 
regimen with the lowest doses of Tadalafil Lilly might be considered suitable, based on patient choice 
and the physician’s judgement. 
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of 
day. The dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. 
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically.

Special populations 
Elderly men 
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. 
Men with renal impairment 
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients 
with severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of 
tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Men with hepatic impairment 
The recommended dose of Tadalafil Lilly is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with 
or without food. There is limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation 
should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. There are no available data about the 
administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day 
dosing has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Men with diabetes 
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Tadalafil Lilly in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Tadalafil Lilly is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water, with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought 
to result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. 
Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is 
contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
Tadalafil Lilly, must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. 
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. 
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and 
the use of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,  
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,  
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,  
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled 
hypertension,  
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. 
- 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tadalafil Lilly is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of 
non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in 
connection or not with previous Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). 
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such 
as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Before treatment with Tadalafil Lilly 
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and 
determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. 
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular 
status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil 
has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) 
and as such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). 
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes 
and the identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not 
known if Tadalafil Lilly is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical 
non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy. 
Cardiovascular 
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and 
tachycardia, have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in 
whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not 
possible to definitively determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to 
Tadalafil Lilly, to sexual activity, or to a combination of these or other factors. 
In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood 
pressure decrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations 
should be given to a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy.  
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of Tadalafil Lilly may lead to 
symptomatic hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and 
doxazosin is not recommended. 
Vision 
Visual defects, including Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and cases of NAION have been 
reported in connection with the intake of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors. Most cases of 
CSCR resolved spontaneously after stopping tadalafil. Regarding NAION, analyses of observational 
data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to 
tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all patients exposed to tadalafil, the 
patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, visual acuity impairment and/or visual 
distortion, he should stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). 
Decreased or sudden hearing loss 
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors 
were present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients should be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of 
sudden decrease or loss of hearing. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to 
influence clearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of Tadalafil Lilly is not recommended in patients 
with severe renal impairment.  
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of Tadalafil Lilly in patients 
with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration has not been 
evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed, a careful individual 
benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. 
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis 
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate 
medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of 
potency may result. 
Tadalafil Lilly, should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such 
as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). 
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tadalafil Lilly to patients using potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased 
tadalafil exposure (AUC) has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5). 
Tadalafil Lilly and other treatments for erectile dysfunction 
The safety and efficacy of combinations of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors or other 
treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take 
Tadalafil Lilly in such combinations. 
Lactose 
Tadalafil Lilly contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard 
to those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant 
interactions at higher doses cannot be completely ruled out. 
Effects of other substances on tadalafil 
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors  
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole 
(200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15
%, relative to the 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 4-fold and Cmax by 22
is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, 
other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be co-administered with caution as they would 
be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see section 4.4). 
%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which 
Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased. 
Transporters 
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. 
Therefore there is the potential of medicinal product interactions mediated by inhibition of 
transporters. 
Cytochrome P450 inducers 
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88
tadalafil alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; 
the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, 
phenytoin and carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.

Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products 
Nitrates 
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
nitrates. Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic 
nitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical trial in which 150 subjects 
receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various 
times, this interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had 
elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of Tadalafil Lilly 
(2.5 mg - 20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening 
situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of Tadalafil Lilly before nitrate 
administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close 
medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. 
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) 
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a 
single dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. 
This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this 
combination is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not 
reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in 
patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at 
minimal dose and progressively adjusted. 
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal 
products were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics 
(bendrofluazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in 
combination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil 
(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose 
was applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical 
pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of 
antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure 
changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy 
subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater 
although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In 
patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a 
blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor 
and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in 
adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. 
However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in 
blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Riociguat 
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors 
were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the 
hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the 
combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including 
tadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).   
5- alpha reductase inhibitors 
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, 
as a formal interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs. 
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) 
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase 
inhibitor) in a clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only 
pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor 
and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these 
medicinal products. 
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline 
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical 
consequence of this is uncertain.

Alcohol 
Alcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08
co-administration with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations 
were seen 3 hours after co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to 
maximise the rate of alcohol absorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol). 
Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or 
approximately 180 ml of 40
dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower 
doses of alcohol (0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar 
frequency to alcohol alone. The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil 
(10 mg).

Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products 
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of 
medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not 
inhibit or induce CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19.

CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by 
warfarin.  
Acetylsalicylic acid 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic 
acid.  
Antidiabetic medicinal products 
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women.  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the 
use of Tadalafil Lilly during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. A 
risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Lilly should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies 
suggest that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in 
some men (see sections 5.1 and 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tadalafil Lilly has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency 
of reports of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be 
aware of how they react to Tadalafil Lilly, before driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking Tadalafil Lilly for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, 
in which the incidences increase with increasing dose of Tadalafil Lilly. The adverse reactions 
reported were transient, and generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with 
Tadalafil Lilly once-a-day dosing are experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment.

(1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4). 
(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials. 
(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking 
antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in 
patients treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities 
were not associated with adverse reactions. 
Other special populations 
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with 
tadalafil taken on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more 
frequently in patients over 65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for 
the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in 
patients over 75 years of age.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 
100 mg have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.  
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis 
contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.  
Mechanism of action 
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, 
inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This 
results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an 
erection. Tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, 
kidney, lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other 
phosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is > 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and 
PDE4, enzymes which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. 
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, 
an enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Three clinical studies were conducted in 1 054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of 
responsiveness to Tadalafil Lilly on demand. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement in erectile function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours 
following dosing, as well as patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse 
compared to placebo as early as 16 minutes following dosing. 
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in 
supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), 
in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, 
respectively), and no significant change in heart rate.  
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination 
(blue/green) was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with 
the low affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of 
changes in colour vision were rare (< 0.1
%).

Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of Tadalafil 
Lilly 10 mg (one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. 
In two of these studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil 
treatment of unlikely clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other 
parameters such as motility, morphology and FSH. 
% on Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg, 50
Tadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg taken once a day was initially evaluated in 3 clinical studies 
involving 853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile dysfunction of 
various severities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy studies of 
general populations, the mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 57 and 
67
placebo. In the study in patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject 
proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46
% on Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, 
as compared to 28
on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, 217 patients who were 
treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg once a day vs. placebo. 
The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68
patients compared to 52
% with placebo. Most patients in these three studies were responders to previous 
% on Tadalafil Lilly 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37
% for patients on placebo. 
% for Tadalafil Lilly 
% with 
In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction 
secondary to spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean 
per-subject proportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg 
(flexible-dose, on demand) of 48
% as compared to 17
% with placebo. 
Paediatric population 
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) 
in which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 
3-arm study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent 
corticosteroid therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were 
randomised to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show 
efficacy in slowing the decline in ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance 
(6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the 
placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the 
tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the 
secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall safety results from this study were generally 
consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with adverse events (AEs) expected in a 
paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of 
tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined. 
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus Tadalafil Lilly may be 
taken with or without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant 
effects on the rate and extent of absorption.

Distribution  
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into 
tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94
is not affected by impaired renal function. 
% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding 
Less than 0.0005
% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. 
Biotransformation 
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major 
circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13 000-fold less 
potent than tadalafil for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed 
metabolite concentrations. 
Elimination  
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61
% 
of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36
% of the dose).  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose 
range of 2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are 
similar to pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25
higher exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not 
clinically significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. 
% 
Renal insufficiency 
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate 
(creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease 
on dialysis. In haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41
% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. 
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
A and B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is 
limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency 
(Child-Pugh Class C). There are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of 
tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed once-a-day, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. 
Patients with diabetes 
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19
value for healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction. 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received 
up to 1 000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed 
effect dose was 30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free active substance at this 
dose was approximately 18 times the human AUC at a 20 mg dose. 
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 
12 months at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 - 18.6] 
than seen in humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous 
tubular epithelium that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation is 
required.  
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males.  
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Erectile dysfunction in adult men 
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or 
without food. 
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried. It 
may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. 
The maximum dose frequency is once per day. 
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not 
recommended for continuous daily use. 
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of Tadalafil Lilly (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily 
regimen with the lowest doses of Tadalafil Lilly might be considered suitable, based on patient choice 
and the physician’s judgement. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of 
day. The dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. 
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically. 
Benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult men  
The recommended dose is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day with or without food. 
For adult men being treated for both benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction the 
recommended dose is also 5 mg taken at approximately the same time every day. Patients who are 
unable to tolerate tadalafil 5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia should consider an 
alternative therapy as the efficacy of tadalafil 2.5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
has not been demonstrated. 
Special populations  
Elderly men 
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. 
Men with renal impairment 
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients 
with severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose for on-demand treatment.  
Once-a-day dosing of 2.5 or 5 mg tadalafil both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or benign 
prostatic hyperplasia is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4. 4 
and 5.2). 
Men with hepatic impairment 
For the treatment of erectile dysfunction using on-demand Tadalafil Lilly the recommended dose of 
Tadalafil Lilly is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without food. There is 
limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken 
by the prescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 
10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment.  
Once-a-day dosing of Tadalafil Lilly both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and benign 
prostatic hyperplasia has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if 
prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing 
physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Men with diabetes 
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Tadalafil Lilly in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction.  
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Tadalafil Lilly is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water, with or without food.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought 
to result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. 
Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is 
contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
Tadalafil Lilly, must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. 
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. 
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and 
the use of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,  
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,  
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,  
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled 
hypertension,  
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. 
- 
Tadalafil Lilly is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of 
non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in 
connection or not with previous Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). 
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such 
as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Before treatment with Tadalafil Lilly  
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction or 
benign prostatic hyperplasia and determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological 
treatment is considered. 
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular 
status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil 
has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) 
and as such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). 
Prior to initiating treatment with tadalafil for benign prostatic hyperplasia patients should be examined 
to rule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate and carefully assessed for cardiovascular 
conditions (see section 4.3). 
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes 
and the identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not 
known if Tadalafil Lilly is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical 
non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy. 
Cardiovascular 
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and 
tachycardia, have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in 
whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible to definitively determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to 
Tadalafil Lilly, to sexual activity, or to a combination of these or other factors. 
In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood 
pressure decrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations 
should be given to a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy.  
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of Tadalafil Lilly may lead to 
symptomatic hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and 
doxazosin is not recommended. 
Vision 
Visual defects, including Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and cases of NAION have been 
reported in connection with the intake of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors. Most cases of 
CSCR resolved spontaneously after stopping tadalafil. Regarding NAION, analyses of observational 
data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to 
tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all patients exposed to tadalafil, the 
patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, visual acuity impairment and/or visual 
distortion, he should stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). 
Decreased or sudden hearing loss 
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors 
were present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) 
patients should be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of 
sudden decrease or loss of hearing. 
Renal and hepatic impairment  
Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to 
influence clearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of Tadalafil Lilly is not recommended in patients 
with severe renal impairment.  
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of Tadalafil Lilly in patients 
with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration either for the 
treatment of erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia has not been evaluated in patients 
with hepatic insufficiency. If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation 
should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. 
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis 
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate 
medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of 
potency may result. 
Tadalafil Lilly, should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such 
as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). 
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tadalafil Lilly to patients using potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased 
tadalafil exposure (AUC) has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5).

Tadalafil Lilly and other treatments for erectile dysfunction 
The safety and efficacy of combinations of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors or other 
treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take 
Tadalafil Lilly in such combinations. 
Lactose 
Tadalafil Lilly contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard 
to those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant 
interactions at higher doses cannot be completely ruled out. 
Effects of other substances on tadalafil 
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors 
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole 
(200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15
AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 4-fold and Cmax by 22
is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, 
other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be co-administered with caution as they would 
be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see section 4.4).

Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased. 
Transporters 
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. 
Therefore there is the potential of medicinal product interactions mediated by inhibition of 
transporters. 
Cytochrome P450 inducers 
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88
tadalafil alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; 
the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, 
phenytoin and carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.

Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products 
Nitrates  
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
nitrates. Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic 
nitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical trial in which 150 subjects 
receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various 
times, this interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had 
elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of Tadalafil Lilly 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2.5 mg - 20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening 
situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of Tadalafil Lilly before nitrate 
administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close 
medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. 
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) 
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a 
single dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. 
This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this 
combination is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not 
reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in 
patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at 
minimal dose and progressively adjusted. 
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal 
products were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics 
(bendrofluazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in 
combination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil 
(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose 
was applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical 
pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of 
antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure 
changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose 
blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy 
subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater 
although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In 
patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a 
blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor 
and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in 
adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. 
However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in 
blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Riociguat 
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors 
were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the 
hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the 
combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including 
tadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).   
5- alpha reductase inhibitors 
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, 
as a formal interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs. 
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) 
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase 
inhibitor) in a clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only 
pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these 
medicinal products. 
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline 
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical 
consequence of this is uncertain.

Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products 
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of 
medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not 
inhibit or induce CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19.  
CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by 
warfarin.  
Acetylsalicylic acid 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic 
acid.  
Antidiabetic medicinal products 
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.

There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the 
use of Tadalafil Lilly during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. A 
risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Lilly should not be used during breast-feeding.

Fertility 
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies 
suggest that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in 
some men (see sections 5.1 and 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tadalafil Lilly has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency 
of reports of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be 
aware of how they react to Tadalafil Lilly, before driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking Tadalafil Lilly for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, 
in which the incidences increase with increasing dose of Tadalafil Lilly. The adverse reactions 
reported were transient, and generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with 
Tadalafil Lilly once-a-day dosing are experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in 
placebo-controlled clinical trials (comprising a total of 8 022 patients on Tadalafil Lilly and 
4 422 patients on placebo) for on-demand and once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the 
once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in 
patients treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities 
were not associated with adverse reactions. 
Other special populations 
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with 
tadalafil taken on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more 
frequently in patients over 65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for 
the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in 
patients over 75 years of age. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 
100 mg have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.  
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis 
contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.  
Mechanism of action 
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, 
inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This 
results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an 
erection. Tadalafil has no effect in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the absence of sexual 
stimulation. 
The effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum is also observed in 
the smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The resulting vascular 
relaxation increases blood perfusion which may be the mechanism by which symptoms of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia are reduced. These vascular effects may be complemented by inhibition of 
bladder afferent nerve activity and smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate and bladder. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, 
kidney, lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other 
phosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is > 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and 
PDE4, enzymes which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. 
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, 
an enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in 
supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), 
in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, 
respectively), and no significant change in heart rate.  
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination 
(blue/green) was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with 
the low affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of 
changes in colour vision were rare (< 0.1
%). 
Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of Tadalafil 
Lilly 10 mg (one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. 
In two of these studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil 
treatment of unlikely clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other 
parameters such as motility, morphology and FSH. 
Erectile dysfunction  
For Tadalafil Lilly on demand, three clinical studies were conducted in 1 054 patients in an at-home 
setting to define the period of responsiveness. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement in erectile function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours 
following dosing, as well as patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse 
compared to placebo as early as 16 minutes following dosing.  
In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction 
secondary to spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean 
per-subject proportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg 
(flexible-dose, on demand) of 48% as compared to 17% with placebo. 
% on Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg, 50
For once-a-day evaluation of tadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg 3 clinical studies were initially 
conducted involving 853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile 
dysfunction of various severities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy 
studies of general populations, the mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 
57 and 67
% with 
placebo. In the study in patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject 
% on Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, 
proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46
as compared to 28
on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, 217 patients who were 
treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg once a day vs. placebo. 
The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68
Lilly patients compared to 52
% with placebo. Most patients in these three studies were responders to previous 
% on Tadalafil Lilly 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37
% for patients on placebo.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia  
Tadalafil Lilly was studied in 4 clinical studies of 12 weeks duration enrolling over 1 500 patients with 
signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The improvement in the total international 
prostate symptom score with Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg in the four studies were -4.8, -5.6, -6.1 and -6.3 
compared to -2.2, -3.6, -3.8 and -4.2 with placebo. The improvements in total international prostate 
symptom score occurred as early as 1 week. In one of the studies, which also included tamsulosin 
0.4 mg as an active comparator, the improvement in total international prostate symptom score with 
Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg, tamsulosin and placebo were -6.3, -5.7 and -4.2 respectively. 
One of these studies assessed improvements in erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia in patients with both conditions. The improvements in the erectile function 
domain of the international index of erectile function and the total international prostate symptom 
score in this study were 6.5 and -6.1 with Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg compared to 1.8 and -3.8 with placebo, 
respectively. The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 71.9% 
with Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg compared to 48.3% with placebo.  
The maintenance of the effect was evaluated in an open-label extension to one of the studies, which 
showed that the improvement in total international prostate symptom score seen at 12 weeks was 
maintained for up to 1 additional year of treatment with Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg.  
Paediatric population 
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) 
in which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 
3-arm study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent 
corticosteroid therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were 
randomised to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show 
efficacy in slowing the decline in ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance 
(6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the 
placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the 
tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the 
secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall safety results from this study were generally 
consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with adverse events (AEs) expected in a 
paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of 
tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined. 
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus Tadalafil Lilly may be 
taken with or without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant 
effects on the rate and extent of absorption. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into 
tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94
is not affected by impaired renal function. 
% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding 
Less than 0.0005
% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. 
Biotransformation 
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major 
circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13 000-fold less 
potent than tadalafil for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed 
metabolite concentrations. 
Elimination  
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
% 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61
of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36
% of the dose).  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose 
range of 2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are 
similar to pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25
higher exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not 
clinically significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. 
% 
Renal insufficiency 
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate 
(creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease 
on dialysis. In haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41
% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. 
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
A and B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is 
limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency 
(Child-Pugh Class C). There are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of 
tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed once-a-day, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. 
Patients with diabetes 
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19
value for healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction. 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received 
up to 1 000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed 
effect dose was 30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free active substance at this 
dose was approximately 18 times the human AUC at a 20 mg dose. 
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 
12 months at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 - 18.6] 
than seen in humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous 
tubular epithelium that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.  
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adult men 
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or 
without food.  
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried.  
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity.  
The maximum dose frequency is once per day.  
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not 
recommended for continuous daily use.  
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of Tadalafil Lilly (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily 
regimen with the lowest doses of Tadalafil Lilly might be considered suitable, based on patient choice 
and the physician’s judgement. 
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of 
day. The dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. 
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically. 
Special populations  
Elderly men 
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. 
Men with renal impairment 
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients 
with severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of 
tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Men with hepatic impairment 
The recommended dose of Tadalafil Lilly is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with 
or without food. There is limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation 
should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. There are no available data about the 
administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day 
dosing has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore if prescribed, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Men with diabetes 
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Tadalafil Lilly in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction.  
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Tadalafil Lilly is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water, with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought 
to result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is 
contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
Tadalafil Lilly, must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. 
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. 
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and 
the use of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,  
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,  
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,  
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled 
hypertension,  
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. 
- 
Tadalafil Lilly is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-
arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in 
connection or not with previous Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). 
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such 
as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Before treatment with Tadalafil Lilly  
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and 
determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. 
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular 
status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil 
has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) 
and as such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). 
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes 
and the identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not 
known if Tadalafil Lilly is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical 
non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy. 
Cardiovascular 
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and 
tachycardia, have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in 
whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not 
possible to definitively determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to 
Tadalafil Lilly, to sexual activity, or to a combination of these or other factors. 
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of Tadalafil Lilly may lead to 
symptomatic hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and 
doxazosin is not recommended. 
Vision 
Visual defects, including Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and cases of NAION have been 
reported in connection with the intake of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors. Most cases of 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CSCR resolved spontaneously after stopping tadalafil. Regarding NAION, analyses of observational 
data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to 
tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all patients exposed to tadalafil, the 
patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, visual acuity impairment and/or visual 
distortion, he should stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). 
Decreased or sudden hearing loss 
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors 
were present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) 
patients should be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of 
sudden decrease or loss of hearing. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of Tadalafil Lilly in patients 
with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. 
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis  
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate 
medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of 
potency may result. 
Tadalafil Lilly, should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such 
as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). 
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tadalafil Lilly to patients using potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased 
tadalafil exposure (AUC) has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5). 
Tadalafil Lilly and other treatments for erectile dysfunction  
The safety and efficacy of combinations of Tadalafil Lilly and other PDE5 inhibitors or other 
treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take 
Tadalafil Lilly in such combinations. 
Lactose  
Tadalafil Lilly contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard 
to those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant 
interactions at higher doses cannot be completely ruled out.

Effects of other substances on tadalafil 
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors 
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole 
(200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15
AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 4-fold and Cmax by 22
is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) 
exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, 
other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be co-administered with caution as they would 
be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see section 4.4). 
Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased.

%, relative to the 
Transporters 
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. 
Therefore there is the potential of medicinal product interactions mediated by inhibition of 
transporters. 
Cytochrome P450 inducers 
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88
tadalafil alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; 
the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, 
phenytoin and carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.

Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products 
Nitrates 
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
nitrates. Therefore, administration of Tadalafil Lilly to patients who are using any form of organic 
nitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical trial in which 150 subjects 
receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various 
times, this interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had 
elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of Tadalafil Lilly 
(2.5 mg - 20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening 
situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of Tadalafil Lilly before nitrate 
administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close 
medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. 
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) 
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a 
single dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. 
This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this 
combination is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not 
reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in 
patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at 
minimal dose and progressively adjusted. 
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal 
products were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics 
(bendrofluazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in 
combination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil 
(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose 
was applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of 
antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure 
changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose 
blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy 
subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater 
although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In 
patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a 
blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor 
and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in 
adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. 
However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in 
blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Riociguat 
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors 
were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the 
hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the 
combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including 
tadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).   
5- alpha reductase inhibitors 
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, 
as a formal interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs. 
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) 
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase 
inhibitor) in a clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only 
pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor 
and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these 
medicinal products. 
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline 
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical 
consequence of this is uncertain.

Alcohol 
Alcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08
co-administration with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations 
were seen 3 hours after co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to 
maximise the rate of alcohol absorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol). 
Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or 
approximately 180 ml of 40
dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower 
doses of alcohol (0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar 
frequency to alcohol alone. The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil 
(10 mg).

Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products 
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of 
medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not 
inhibit or induce CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19.

CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by 
warfarin.  
Acetylsalicylic acid 
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic 
acid.  
Antidiabetic medicinal products 
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women. 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the 
use of Tadalafil Lilly during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. A 
risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Lilly should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies 
suggest that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in 
some men (see sections 5.1 and 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tadalafil Lilly has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency 
of reports of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be 
aware of how they react to Tadalafil Lilly, before driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking Tadalafil Lilly for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, 
in which the incidences increase with increasing dose of Tadalafil Lilly. The adverse reactions 
reported were transient, and generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with 
Tadalafil Lilly once-a-day dosing are experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment.

(1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4). 
(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials. 
(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking 
antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in 
patients treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities 
were not associated with adverse reactions. 
Other special populations 
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with 
tadalafil taken on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more 
frequently in patients over 65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for 
the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in 
patients over 75 years of age.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 
100 mg have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.  
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis 
contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.  
Mechanism of action 
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, 
inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This 
results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an 
erection. Tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, 
kidney, lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other 
phosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is > 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and 
PDE4, enzymes which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. 
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, 
an enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also 
> 10 000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Three clinical studies were conducted in 1 054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of 
responsiveness to Tadalafil Lilly. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 
erectile function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, 
as well as patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to 
placebo as early as 16 minutes following dosing.  
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in 
supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), 
in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, 
respectively), and no significant change in heart rate.  
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination 
(blue/green) was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the low affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of 
changes in colour vision were rare (< 0.1
%). 
Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of Tadalafil 
Lilly 10 mg (one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. 
In two of these studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil 
treatment of unlikely clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other 
parameters such as motility, morphology and FSH. 
Tadalafil at doses of 2 to 100 mg has been evaluated in 16 clinical studies involving 3 250 patients, 
including patients with erectile dysfunction of various severities (mild, moderate, severe), etiologies, 
ages (range 21-86 years), and ethnicities. Most patients reported erectile dysfunction of at least 1 year 
in duration. In the primary efficacy studies of general populations, 81

In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction

(flexible-dose, on demand) of 48
% as compared to 17
% with placebo. 
Paediatric population 
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) 
in which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 
3-arm study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent 
corticosteroid therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were 
randomised to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show 
efficacy in slowing the decline in ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance 
(6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the 
placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the 
tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the 
secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall safety results from this study were generally 
consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with adverse events (AEs) expected in a 
paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of 
tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined. 
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus Tadalafil Lilly may be 
taken with or without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant 
effects on the rate and extent of absorption.

Distribution  
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into 
tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94
is not affected by impaired renal function. 
Less than 0.0005
% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. 
% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding 
Biotransformation 
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major 
circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13 000-fold less 
potent than tadalafil for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed 
metabolite concentrations. 
Elimination  
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
% 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61
of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36
% of the dose).  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose 
range of 2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are 
similar to pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25
higher exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not 
clinically significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. 
% 
Renal insufficiency  
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate 
(creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease 
on dialysis. In haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41
% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. 
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. 
Hepatic insufficiency  
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
A and B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is 
limited clinical data on the safety of Tadalafil Lilly in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency 
(Child-Pugh Class C). If Tadalafil Lilly is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation 
should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. There are no available data about the 
administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. 
Patients with diabetes 
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19
value for healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction. 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received 
up to 1 000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed 
effect dose was 30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free active substance at this 
dose was approximately 18 times the human AUC at a 20 mg dose. 
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 
12 months at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 - 18.6] 
than seen in humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous 
tubular epithelium that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tadalafil Lilly is and what it is used for 
Tadalafil Lilly is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, 
or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil Lilly has been shown to significantly 
improve the ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Lilly works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Lilly will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.  
It is important to note that Tadalafil Lilly does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Lilly 
Do not take Tadalafil Lilly if you: 
- 
- 
are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group 
of medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil Lilly 
has been shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate 
or are unsure tell your doctor. 
have serious heart disease or recently had a heart attack within the last 90 days.  
recently had a stroke within the last 6 months. 
have low blood pressure or uncontrolled high blood pressure. 
ever had loss of vision because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a 
condition described as “stroke of the eye”. 
are taking riociguat. This medicine is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, 
such as Tadalafil Lilly, have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If 
you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your doctor.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Tadalafil Lilly. 
Be aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an 
extra strain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor.

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-

leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). 
any deformation of your penis. 
a serious liver problem. 
a severe kidney problem. 
It is not known if Tadalafil Lilly is effective in patients who have had: 
- 
- 
pelvic surgery. 
removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical 
non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy). 
If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision or your vision is distorted, dimmed while you are 
taking Tadalafil Lilly, stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and contact your doctor immediately.  
Decreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not 
known if the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, 
stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and contact your doctor immediately.

Fertility 
When dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was 
seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. 
Driving and using machines 
Some men taking Tadalafil Lilly in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you 
react to the tablets before driving or using machines. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Tadalafil Lilly 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
Tadalafil Lilly tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The 
tablets can be taken with or without food.  
The recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the 
day. Your doctor may adjust the dose to 2.5 mg based on your response to Tadalafil Lilly. This will be 
given as a 2.5 mg tablet. 
Do not take Tadalafil Lilly more than once a day.  
Once a day dosing of Tadalafil Lilly may be useful to men who anticipate having sexual activity two 
or more times per week. 
When taken once a day Tadalafil Lilly allows you to obtain an erection, when sexually stimulated, at 
any time point during the 24 hours of the day.  
It is important to note that Tadalafil Lilly does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. 
Drinking alcohol may affect your ability to get an erection and may temporarily lower your blood 
pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take Tadalafil Lilly, avoid excessive drinking (blood 
% or greater), since this may increase the risk of dizziness when standing up. 
alcohol level of 0.08
If you take more Tadalafil Lilly than you should  
Contact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4. 
If you forget to take Tadalafil Lilly 
Take your dose as soon as you remember but do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
tablet. You should not take Tadalafil Lilly more than once a day. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tadalafil Lilly is and what it is used for 
Tadalafil Lilly contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.  
Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg is used to treat adult men with:  
- 
erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for 
sexual activity. Tadalafil Lilly has been shown to significantly improve the ability of obtaining a 
hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. 
Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Lilly works by helping the blood vessels in your penis to 
relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is improved erectile 
function. Tadalafil Lilly will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. It is important 
to note that Tadalafil Lilly for the treatment of erectile dysfunction does not work if there is no 
sexual stimulation. You and your partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if 
you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction. 
- 
urinary symptoms associated with a common condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
This is when the prostate gland gets bigger with age. Symptoms include difficulty in starting to 
pass water, a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder and a more frequent need to pass 
water even at night. Tadalafil Lilly improves blood flow to, and relaxes the muscles of, the 
prostate and bladder which may reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil 
Lilly has been shown to improve these urinary symptoms as early as 1-2 weeks after starting 
treatment. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Lilly 
Do not take Tadalafil Lilly if you: 
- 
- 
are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group 
of medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil Lilly 
has been shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate 
or are unsure tell your doctor. 
have serious heart disease or recently had a heart attack within the last 90 days.  
recently had a stroke within the last 6 months.

ever had loss of vision because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a 
condition described as “stroke of the eye”. 
are taking riociguat. This medicine is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, 
such as Tadalafil Lilly, have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If 
you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Tadalafil Lilly. 
Be aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an 
extra strain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor.  
Since benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer may have the same symptoms, your doctor will 
check you for prostate cancer before starting treatment with Tadalafil Lilly for benign prostatic 
hyperplasia. Tadalafil Lilly does not treat prostate cancer. 
Before taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells). 
multiple myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow). 
leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). 
any deformation of your penis. 
a serious liver problem. 
a severe kidney problem. 
It is not known if Tadalafil Lilly is effective in patients who have had: 
- 
- 
pelvic surgery. 
removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical 
non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy). 
If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision or your vision is distorted, dimmed while you are 
taking Tadalafil Lilly, stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and contact your doctor immediately.  
Decreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not 
known if the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, 
stop taking Tadalafil Lilly and contact your doctor immediately. 
Tadalafil Lilly is not intended for use by women.   
Children and adolescents 
Tadalafil Lilly is not intended for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. 
Other medicines and Tadalafil Lilly 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
Do not take Tadalafil Lilly if you are already taking nitrates.  
Some medicines may be affected by Tadalafil Lilly or they may affect how well Tadalafil Lilly will 
work. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking:

an alpha blocker (used to treat high blood pressure or urinary symptoms due to a condition 
where prostate gland enlarges in men).

Lilly will work and should be taken with caution. Talk to your doctor for further information. 
Fertility 
When dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was 
seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. 
Driving and using machines 
Some men taking Tadalafil Lilly in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you 
react to the tablets before driving or using machines. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Tadalafil Lilly 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
Tadalafil Lilly tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The 
tablets can be taken with or without food.  
Drinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take 
Tadalafil Lilly, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater), since this may 
increase the risk of dizziness when standing up. 
For the treatment of erectile dysfunction  
The recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the 
day. Your doctor may adjust the dose to 2.5 mg based on your response to Tadalafil Lilly. This will be 
given as a 2.5 mg tablet. 
Do not take Tadalafil Lilly more than once a day.  
When taken once a day Tadalafil Lilly allows you to obtain an erection, when sexually stimulated, at 
any time point during the 24 hours of the day. Once a day dosing of Tadalafil Lilly may be useful to 
men who anticipate having sexual activity two or more times per week. 
It is important to note that Tadalafil Lilly does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. 
Drinking alcohol may affect your ability to get an erection. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the treatment benign prostatic hyperplasia

If you have benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction, the dose remains one 5 mg tablet 
taken once a day.

If you take more Tadalafil Lilly than you should  
Contact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4.

partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. 
Drinking alcohol may affect your ability to get an erection and may temporarily lower your blood

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tadalafil Lilly is and what it is used for 
Tadalafil Lilly is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, 
or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil Lilly has been shown to significantly 
improve the ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. 
Tadalafil Lilly contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Lilly works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Lilly will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.  
It is important to note that Tadalafil Lilly does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Lilly

of medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil Lilly 
has been shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate 
or are unsure tell your doctor.

are taking riociguat. This medicine is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, 
such as Tadalafil Lilly, have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If 
you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your doctor.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tadalafil, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on serous central chorioretinopathy from the literature and spontaneous 
reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-
challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship 
between tadalafil and central serous chorioretinopathy is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing tadalafil should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tadalafil the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tadalafil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

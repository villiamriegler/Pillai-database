2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. The MAH of the reference product, Procoralan, has provided consent to allow 
access to Modules 2 to 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, 
assessed and approved. Procoralan had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Ivabradine Anpharm are identical to the up to 
date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Procoralan. 
Procoralan is indicated in: 
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris 
Ivabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary artery 
disease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥  70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated: 
in adults unable to tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of beta-blockers 
or in combination with beta-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal beta-blocker 
- 
- 
dose. 
Treatment of chronic heart failure Ivabradine is indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic 
dysfunction, in patients in sinus rhythm and whose heart rate is ≥  75 bpm, in combination with standard 
therapy including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.  
The active substance of Ivabradine Anpharm is ivabradine hydrochloride, a heart rate (HR) lowering agent with 
specific effect on the sinus node with no effects on intra-atrial, atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction 
times, myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594878/2015 
Page 4/8 
 
  
  
Ivabradine selectively blocks the f-channel in the pacemaker cells of the sinus node by entering and binding to 
a site in the channel pore. By inhibiting ion flow through the f-channel, ivabradine reduces the f-current (If) thus 
reducing the slope of the slow diastolic depolarisation phase of the action potential in the sinus node cells, 
thereby increasing the time required to reach the voltage threshold for action potential initiation. This in turn 
slows the spontaneous firing of sino-atrial node cells and therefore the heart rate (HR). Electrophysiological 
studies in sino-atrial node cells have demonstrated that, at therapeutic doses, ivabradine does not act on any 
other cardiac ion currents (IK, ICaL or ICaT). Ivabradine exerts a pure heart rate lowering effect without any 
direct effect on myocardial contractility and relaxation, cardiac output, coronary haemodynamics, blood 
pressure and peripheral resistance. 
The application for Ivabradine Anpharm consists only of Module 1 information. 
Compliance with GLP, GMP, GCP 
No new preclinical studies were conducted, which is acceptable given that this is an informed consent 
application. The product has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances 
and the same pharmaceutical form as Procoralan. 
No clinical studies were conducted, which is acceptable given that this is an informed consent application. The 
clinical studies conducted for the original Procoralan applications were considered to be in accordance with the 
appropriate GCP guidelines for the ethical treatment of human subjects. 
The CHMP has been assured that acceptable standards of GMP are in place for this product. The proposed sites 
of manufacture are the same as currently approved for Procoralan. For manufacturing sites within the 
community, the CHMP has accepted copies of current manufacturer authorisations issued by inspection services 
of the competent authorities as certification that acceptable standards of GMP are in place at those sites. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Procoralan, the quality data in support of the Ivabradine 
Anpharm application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Procoralan dossier, which has been 
assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to Module 4 data for Procoralan, no additional studies have been provided. Since this 
application is an informed consent of the Procoralan application, the non-clinical data in support of the 
Ivabradine Anpharm application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Procoralan dossier, which 
have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the scope described in the CHMP guideline, given that this application is for products that are 
already authorized, the absence of a phased approach ERA as specified in the guideline, is considered justified 
in that the total quantity of the drug substance ivabradine hydrochloride is not expected to increase upon 
Assessment report

approval of this marketing authorization. The applicant has referred to the Environmental Risk Assessment for 
Procoralan. Marketing of Ivabradine Anpharm in Europe is not expected to increase the environmental risk. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the non-clinical data. All the non-clinical 
data have been assessed for Procoralan application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to Module 5 data for Procoralan, no additional studies have been provided. Since this 
application is an informed consent of the Procoralan application, the clinical data in support of the Ivabradine 
Anpharm application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Procoralan dossier, which have been 
assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical aspects.  
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the clinical data. All the clinical data have 
been assessed for Procoralan application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
2.5.  Risk Management Plan 
The risk management plan (RMP), version 5.1, has been provided for Procoralan/Corlentor. This RMP has been 
updated only to include Ivabradine Anpharm as it will also apply to Ivabradine Anpharm. Version 5.0 of the RMP 
for Procoralan has previously been assessed and was considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfil  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.  Product information 
Product Information 
The proposed SmPC and PL are the same as the currently approved SmPC and PL for Procoralan but one 
additional correction was requested to the SmPC section 6.6. In order to protect the environment the applicant 
was asked to add the following standard disposal advice to section 6.6 of the SmPC: “Any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.”

Consultation with target patient groups 
Consultation with target patient groups has not been undertaken for Ivabradine Anpharm. The content of the 
package  leaflet  is  identical  to  the  latest  approved  leaflet  of  Procoralan  and  therefore  no  further  testing  is 
warranted. 
Braille 
The product name and strength will be included on the outer cartons in Braille. The format will be in accordance 
with the recommendations of the European Commission. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This Marketing Authorisation application for Ivabradine Anpharm has been submitted by ANPHARM 
Przedsiębiorstwo Farmaceutyczne S.A. as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of 
Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Ivabradine Anpharm medicinal product are identical to the 
up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Procoralan. The application for Ivabradine Anpharm 
concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Procoralan and consists of only Module 1. Information on 
the scientific discussion can be found on the Procoralan CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. 
Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Procoralan initial 
marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP considers that 
the benefit/risk balance for Ivabradine Anpharm is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Ivabradine Anpharm in the  
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris

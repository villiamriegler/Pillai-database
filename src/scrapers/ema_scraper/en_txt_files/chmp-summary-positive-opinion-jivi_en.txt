Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Jivi 
damoctocog alfa pegol 
On 20 September 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Jivi, intended 
for the treatment of haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Jivi was designated as an orphan 
medicinal product on 23 February 2011. The applicant for this medicinal product is Bayer AG. 
Jivi will be available as powder and solvent for solution for injection (250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU 
and 3000 IU). The active substance of Jivi is damoctocog alfa pegol, a recombinant human factor VIII 
(ATC code: B02BD02), which replaces the missing coagulation factor VIII needed for effective 
haemostasis. 
The benefits with Jivi are its ability to prevent and control bleeding when used on demand and during 
surgical procedures, as seen in clinical trials in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A. The most 
common side effects are hypersensitivity, insomnia, headache, dizziness, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, erythema, rash, infusion site reactions and pyrexia. 
The full indication is: “Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥  12 years of 
age with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).” 
It is proposed that Jivi be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

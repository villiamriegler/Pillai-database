1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Further review of the submitted data, the rapporteur is of the opinion that the data support the 
requirement for a variation and should not be assessed as a PAM.  
Therefore the MAH is requested to submit a variation. (in this case no need for assessment of the 
data).

083 and 084 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that studies DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT002 and DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT003 are 
stand alone studies.  
The experimental DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine is a 7-valent paediatric vaccine containing the 
following antigens: diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin 
(FHA) and pertactin (PRN), recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), poliovirus types 1, 2, 3, 
polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (PRP) and meningococcal serogroup C (MenC). 
The main objective of the studies was to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of the 
experimental 7-valent vaccine in two vaccine schedules (2, 3, 4 and 2, 4, 12 months of age) and in co-
administration with Synflorix or Prevenar 13 and/or Rotarix. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The lyophilised and liquid formulations of Rotarix were used in this study.  
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT002, a phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 9 
study sites in Poland to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the experimental DTPa-HBV-
IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Synflorix) 
EMA/635814/2015  
Page 3/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in healthy infants when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months 
of age.  
All subjects received Rotarix at 2 and 3 months of age. However, Rotarix was not specifically studied in 
this study. 
• 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT003, a phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 
33 study sites in Canada, France and Germany to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the 
experimental DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine, when given to healthy infants at 2, 4 and 12 
months of age. 
Rotarix administration was optional. The lyophilised and liquid formulations of Rotarix were used in this 
study. In France, Rotarix was not administered to the subjects. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT-002, Phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of the experimental DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered 
with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Synflorix) in healthy infants when administered as a 
three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age. 
Description 
This was a Phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 9 study sites in Poland. 
Rotarix was one of the vaccines that were co-administered with the experimental 7-valent study 
vaccine at 2 and 3 months of age. 
Booster vaccine doses will be provided at 16-18 months of age to all study participants as part of a 
separate clinical trial (113978 [DTPa-HBV-IPV-Hib-MenC-TT-004 BST 002]). 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: 
Immunogenicity 
 
To demonstrate that DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered PCV10 (Synflorix) is 
non-inferior to DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) co-administered with meningococcal 
serogroup C vaccine (Menjugate, Novartis), in terms of seroprotection to MenC one month 
after the third dose of primary vaccination. 
Criteria for non-inferiority: Non-inferiority for MenC will be demonstrated if the upper limit of 
the 95% CI on the group difference [HexaMnC minus Hepta] in the percentage of 
seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%. 
 
To demonstrate that DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with PCV10 
(Synflorix), is non-inferior to DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) co-administered with 
PCV10 (Synflorix), in terms of seroprotection to Hib one month after the third dose of primary 
vaccination. 
Criteria for non-inferiority: Non-inferiority for Hib will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 
95% CI on the group difference [HexaPn minus Hepta] in percentage of seroprotected subjects 
is ≤ 10%.

Secondary: 
Immunogenicity 
 
To demonstrate that DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with PCV10 
(Synflorix), is non-inferior to DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) co-administered with 
PCV10 (Synflorix), in terms of seroprotection to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus 
types 1, 2 and 3, and in terms of concentration of antibodies to pertussis one month after the 
third dose of primary vaccination. 
Non-inferiority with regard to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus will be 
demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [HexaPn minus Hepta] 
in percentage of seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%. 
Non-inferiority with regard to pertussis antigens will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 
95% CI on the GMC ratio [HexaPn divided by Hepta] is < 1.5. 
 
To assess the immunological response to the study vaccines in terms of 
seroprotection/seropositivity, geometric mean concentrations/titres to all antigens and in terms 
of vaccine response to pertussis antigens. 
 
To assess the pre-vaccination immunological status to MenC and Hib. 
Safety 
 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine 
coadministered with PCV10 (Synflorix) in terms of solicited, unsolicited, local and general 
symptoms and serious adverse events. 
Assessor’s comment  
No immunogenicity results were generated for Rotarix in this study. The immunogenicity study 
objectives were not related to Rotarix and will therefore not be assessed within this procedure.  
Study design 
Subjects were randomized into 3 study groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Blood samples were collected from all subjects at the following time points: 
 
 
“Pre” (2 mL), at study Visit 1, just before the administration of the first vaccine dose. 
“Post” (5 mL), at study Visit 4, approximately one month after the third vaccine dose.

HRV: Human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) 
Study population /Sample size 
Healthy male or female infant aged between 8 and 12 weeks at the time of first vaccination, born after 
a gestation period between 36 and 42 weeks who had received one dose of hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine 
at birth according to the local recommendations. The subject should not have had diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis, hepatitis B, polio, Hib, pneumococcal and/or MenC vaccination or disease(s). Written 
informed consent was obtained from the parents/legally acceptable representative (LAR) of the subject 
before entry into the study. 
A total of 420 subjects (140 per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled in order to have at least 
378 evaluable subjects (approximately 126 subjects in each treatment group) at the time of the 
analysis. 
Blinding 
This study was conducted in an open manner due to the difference in the visual aspects of the Hib and 
Hib-MenC-TT vaccine vials and due to the different number of injections across the study groups (only 
two doses of Menjugate in the HexaMnC group). The laboratory in charge of the serology testing was 
blinded to the treatment, and codes were used to link the subject and study (without any link to the 
treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample. 
Treatments 
Study vaccine: A candidate 7-valent paediatric vaccine similar to the 6-valent Infanrix hexa, but 
containing 5 µg PRP (Hib-antigen) and 5 µg Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C capsular polysaccharide 
conjugated to tetanus toxoid (MenC-antigen) instead of 10 µg PRP (Hib-antigen) in Infanrix hexa. 
Similar to Infanrix hexa, the DTPa-HBV-IPV component is presented as a turbid white suspension in a 
pre-filled syringe. The lyophilised Hib-MenC component is presented as a white pellet in a glass vial; it 
must be reconstituted before use with the liquid DTPa-HBVIPV component. 
Active control vaccines:  
The following licensed vaccines were used as active controls: 
EMA/635814/2015  
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa), 
  Novartis’ meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (Menjugate). 
Concomitant vaccines:  
The following licensed vaccines were used as co-administered vaccines: 
  GSK Biologicals’ 10Pn-PD-DiT (Synflorix), 
  GSK Biologicals’ Human Rotavirus Vaccine (Rotarix). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Since no immunogenicity results were generated for Rotarix in this study, only the safety endpoints are 
described here. 
Safety: 
  Occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms during the 8-day (Day 0- Day 7) follow-up 
period after each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during the 31-day (Day 0- Day 30) follow-up period after 
each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) from Dose 1 up to study end. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 421 subjects vaccinated in this study, 413 subjects completed the study and eight subjects were 
withdrawn from the study. 
The reasons for withdrawal of the subjects were as follows: 
  One subject in the Hepta group  was withdrawn from the study as a result of a SAE.  
 
The parents/LARs of seven subjects (two in the Hepta group, three in the HexaMnC group  and 
two in the HexaPn group) withdrew consent. None of these consent withdrawals was due to an 
adverse event.

Safety results 
Table 2. Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 8-day (Days 
0-7) post-vaccination period overall by dose (Total vaccinated cohort) 
Summary of safety according to co-administration vaccine regimen. Rotarix was co-administered in 
each group at 2 and 3 months of age. 
 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in each group 
(incidences ranging from 46.3% of doses in HexaMnC group to 59.8% of doses in the HexaPn 
group). 
 
There was no report of grade 3 fever (> 39.0°C axillary temperature) in the Hepta and the 
HexaPn groups and one report of grade 3 fever in the HexaMnC group. 
  Unsolicited symptoms judged as possibly causally related to vaccination were reported 
following a maximum of 9 (2.1%) doses in a given group. Diarrhoea (following 3 [0.7%] 
doses in the HexaPn group, 1 [0.2%] dose in the Hepta group and 1 [0.2%] dose in the 
HexMnC group) and flatulence (following 2 [0.5%] doses in the Hepta group and none in the 
other groups) were the most frequent unsolicited symptoms considered possibly related to 
vaccination. 
  No deaths were reported during this study. 
EMA/635814/2015  
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Non-fatal SAEs were reported for a total of 14 subjects during the entire study period. Among 
these five subjects belonged to the Hepta group, six subjects were from the HexaMnC group 
and three were from the HexaPn group. One of these SAEs, for subject number 383 belonging 
to the Hepta group was considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator. 
Eight days after the third dose of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT and Synflorix vaccines and 
39 days after the second dose of Rotarix, this subject developed thrombocytopenia. On 22 
Nov 2009 the subject experienced blood in stools. A few days later the subject developed mild 
purpuric rash. The subject was treated with immunoglobulins and steroids and the event was 
reported as resolved 116 days after the onset of symptoms. 
Assessor’s comment  
The safety profile is judged acceptable. Diarrhoea and flatulence could have occurred as a result of 
Rotarix vaccination. Irritability is also a known adverse reaction associated with Rotarix. Since Rotarix 
was co-administered with other vaccines in the study, the safety analysis performed in this study does 
not relate to administration of Rotarix alone. The overall safety conclusion was that the experimental 
7-valent vaccine was well tolerated. 
The MAH concluded that no changes to the product information are needed since no specific data on 
Rotarix were obtained in this study, which is accepted. 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/HibMenC-TT003, a phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of the experimental DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine, when given to 
healthy infants at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. 
Description 
This was a Phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 33 study sites in Canada, France and 
Germany. The study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-
MenC-TT vaccine when administered at 2, 4 and 12 months of age (2+1 schedule) as compared to the 
concomitant administration of the licensed hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) with 
the monovalent MenC vaccine Menjugate. 
Two doses of Rotarix were offered to the study participants, except if there is an advice of the local 
authorities in the participating country not to do so. Since Rotavirus vaccination is not mandatory in 
the participating countries and since Rotarix is not expected to impact the immunogenicity of any of 
the other study vaccines, the decision to administer Rotarix was at the discretion of the investigator in 
consultation with the parents/LARs. 
Rotarix was offered at Visit 1 (8-12 weeks of age) and Visit 2 (about 4 months of age). 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: 
Immunogenicity 
 
To demonstrate that DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) (Combo group) was non-inferior to DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine 
EMA/635814/2015

(Infanrix hexa) co-administered with meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (Menjugate), and 
Prevenar 13 (Control group), in terms of immune response to Hib and MenC antigens, one 
month after the second vaccine dose. 
Criteria for non-inferiority: Non-inferiority in terms of response to PRP was demonstrated if the 
upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) on the group 
difference [Control minus Combo] in percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody 
concentrations ≥ 0.15µg/ml was ≤ 10%. Non-inferiority in terms of response to MenC was 
demonstrated if the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference 
[Control minus Combo] in percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥ 8 was ≤ 10%. 
Secondary: 
Immunogenicity 
No secondary immunogenicity endpoints related to Rotarix, and therefore not discussed. 
Safety 
 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccines as a three-dose vaccination 
course, in terms of solicited symptoms (local and general), unsolicited symptoms and serious 
adverse events (SAEs). 
Assessor’s comment  
No immunogenicity results were generated for Rotarix in this study. The immunogenicity study 
objectives were not related to Rotarix and will therefore not be assessed within this procedure.  
Study design 
Subjects were randomized into 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio. 
Blood sampling: Blood samples (5 ml) were collected from all subjects at the following time points: 
 
“Post-Vacc 2”, at study Visit 3, approximately one month after the administration of the second 
vaccine dose; 
 
 
“Pre-Vacc 3”, at study Visit 4, just before the administration of the third vaccine dose; 
“Post-Vacc 3”, at study Visit 5, approximately one month after the third vaccine dose.

Study population /Sample size 
Healthy male or female infants between, and including, 8 and 12 months of age at the time of first 
vaccination and born after a gestation period between 36 and 42 weeks were enrolled in the study. 
Written informed consent was obtained from the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) of the 
subject. Subjects with evidence of previous diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, 
Hib, pneumococcal and MenC vaccination or disease at any time during the study period were not 
included in the study.  
A total of 468 subjects (234 per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled in order to have at least 
420 evaluable subjects (approximately 210 subjects in each treatment group) at the time of the 
analysis. 
Blinding 
This study was conducted in an open manner as the number of vaccines to be administered per visit 
differed between the groups. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing was blinded to the 
treatment, and codes were used to link the subject and study (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample. 
Treatments 
Study vaccine: A candidate 7-valent paediatric vaccine similar to the 6-valent Infanrix hexa, but 
containing 5 µg PRP (Hib-antigen) and 5 µg Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C capsular polysaccharide

pre-filled syringe. The lyophilised Hib-MenC component is presented as a white pellet in a glass vial; it 
must be reconstituted before use with the liquid DTPa-HBV-IPV component. 
Active control vaccines:  
The following licensed vaccines were used as active controls: 
  GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa), 
EMA/635814/2015  
Page 11/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Novartis’ meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (Menjugate). 
Concomitant vaccines:  
The following licensed vaccines were used as co-administered vaccines: 
  Wyeth Lederle’s 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13), 
  GSK Biologicals’ Human Rotavirus Vaccine (Rotarix). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Since no immunogenicity results were generated for Rotarix in this study, only the safety endpoints are 
described here. 
Safety: 
  Occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms during the 8-day (Day 0- Day 7) follow-up 
period after each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during the 31-day (Day 0- Day 30) follow-up period after 
each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) from Dose 1 up to study end. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 480 subjects vaccinated in this study, 474 subjects completed the primary vaccination series (2 
and 4 months of age) and 453 subjects completed the primary and booster series (2, 4 and 12  
months of age). 
None of the withdrawals was due to a serious adverse event. 
One withdrawal was due to a non-serious adverse event. 
Safety results 
A total of 301 subjects received at least one dose of Rotarix: 150 subjects in the study vaccine group 
(“Combo”) and 151 subjects in the control group.

Summary of safety according to co-administration vaccine regimen. Rotarix was co-administered in 
each group at about 2-3 months of age, and at 4 months of age. 
 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (reported for 87.4% 
of subjects in the Combo group and 85.9% of subjects in the Control group). It was also the 
most frequently reported grade 3 solicited general symptom. 
 
There was no report of grade 3 fever (> 39.0°C axillary temperature). 
  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 62.2% of subjects in Combo group and 
65.3% of subjects in Control group during the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow up period. Unsolicited 
symptoms of grade 3 intensity were reported for 6.7% of subjects in the Combo group and 
10.7% of subjects in the Control group. Two subjects in the Control group reported unsolicited 
symptoms (flatulence and persistent crying) of grade 3 intensity that were assessed by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
  No deaths were reported during this study. 
  SAEs were reported for 12 subjects (5.0%) in the Combo group and 15 subjects (6.2%) in 
Control group during the entire study period. No SAE was considered by the investigator as 
causally related to the vaccinations. All SAEs were resolved by the end of the study. 
Assessor’s comment  
The safety profile is judged acceptable. Flatulence could have occurred as a result of Rotarix 
vaccination. Irritability is also a known adverse reaction associated with Rotarix.  
Since Rotarix was co-administered with other vaccines in the study, the safety analysis performed in 
this study does not relate to administration of Rotarix alone. The overall safety conclusion was that the 
experimental 7-valent vaccine was well tolerated. 
The MAH concluded that no changes to the product information are needed since no specific data on 
Rotarix were obtained in this study, which is accepted.

2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The concomitant use of Rotarix with hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, pneumococcal and meningococcal 
serogroup C (MenC) vaccines has been documented previously in clinical studies demonstrating that 
the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. 
The current studies investigated an experimental 7-valent paediatric vaccine with Rotarix being one of 
several concomitant vaccines. The immune response and the safety profile of Rotarix co-administration 
was, however, not specifically studied. No conclusion can therefore be drawn as to the influence of co-
administering Rotarix with the new 7-valent vaccine in combination with pneumococcal vaccines PCV10 
or PCV13. 
The safety profile in these limited study populations (410 and 301 Rotarix recipients, respectively) do 
not give rise to new safety concerns and are consistent with the documented safety profile of Rotarix. 
No further regulatory action is considered necessary.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is needed. 
The provided data do not cause concern regarding the safety of Rotarix.  
The benefit/risk balance of Rotarix therefore remains positive. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

efficacy information (final OS data) based on final 
Annex II 
The final analysis of OS for the adjuvant treatment of EGFR 
results from study D5164C00001 (ADAURA) listed as 
a PAES in the Annex II; this is a Phase III, double-
blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
mutation-positive NSCLC, with or without prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy, demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in OS for patients treated with TAGRISSO 
compared to placebo for both the stage II-IIIA population 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

osimertinib versus placebo in the adjuvant setting in 
patients with stage IB-IIIA epidermal growth factor 
receptor mutation positive (EGFRm) non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone complete 
tumour resection, with or without postoperative 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Annex II has also been 
updated accordingly to remove this study. The RMP 
version 15.2 is approved. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to implement editorial changes to 
the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
(100 OS events [21% maturity]; HR=0.49; 95.03% CI: 
0.33, 0.73; p-value=0.0004) and the overall population 
(IB-IIIA; 124 OS events [18% maturity]; HR=0.49; 
95.03% CI: 0.34, 0.70; p-value < 0.0001).  
For both populations, the median OS was not reached in 
either treatment arm and the 95% CIs were not calculable. 
The median follow-up time for OS in all patients was 59.9 
months (stage II-IIIA population) and 60.4 months (stage 
IB-IIIA population) in the TAGRISSO arm and 56.2 months 
(stage II-IIIA population) and 59.4 months (stage IB IIIA 
population) in the placebo arm.

Update of section 4.8 to include Toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) as a new adverse reaction, with the frequency 
unknown. As a result, sections 4.2 and 4.4 are also 
updated to reflect that Tagrisso should be interrupted if 
signs and symptoms of TEN appear and should be 
discontinued if TEN is diagnosed. Furthermore, the 
frequency of interstitial lung disease has been updated in 
section 4.8 based on the addition of Organising Pneumonia 
to the interstitial lung disease umbrella term.

The results of the final OS analysis in AURA3 (DCO4 of 15 
the information regarding overall survival (OS) based 
II and Labelling 
March 2019; 67.1% maturity for OS overall) have been 
on the final results from study D5160C00003 
(AURA3); this is a randomized study of osimertinib 
versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed 
with previous EGFR TKI. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Osimertinib 
demonstrated a numerical advantage in OS compared to 
chemotherapy, which did not reach statistical significance 
(HR=0.87 [95.564% CI: 0.67, 1.13]; p=0.277). The 
median OS was 26.8 months (95% CI: 23.49, 31.54) in the 
osimertinib arm and 22.5 months (95% CI: 20.17, 28.81) 
in the chemotherapy arm. The interpretation of the OS 
results from this study is confounded by the fact that a 
large proportion of patients in the chemotherapy arm 
crossed over to receive treatment with osimertinib after 
RECIST progression (99/140 [70.7%]).

determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and

patients with advanced solid tumours and normal

during the procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
advanced solid tumours and with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh A, mean score = 5.3, n=7) or moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, mean score = 8.2, n=5) 
had no increase in exposure compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function (n=10) after a single 80 mg dose 
of Tagrisso. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 
osimertinib AUC and Cmax was 63.3% (47.3, 84.5) and 
51.4% (36.6, 72.3) in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment and 68.4% (49.6, 94.2) and 60.7% (41.6, 
88.6) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; for the 
metabolite AZ5104 the AUC and Cmax were 66.5% (43.4, 
Page 12/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
101.9) and 66.3% (45.3, 96.9) in patients with mild

(28.9, 67.1) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 
compared to the exposure in patients with normal hepatic 
function. 
Based on these data, the CHMP concluded that no dose 
adjustments are necessary in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh A) or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh B). Similarly, based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is 
recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) >ULN or total bilirubin >1.0 to 
1.5x ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin between 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST).

the effect of single and multiple oral doses of 
osimertinib on the pharmacokinetics of a P-

with advanced EGFRm NSCLC that have progressed 
on a prior EGFR-TKI regimen. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to make a correction in Annex 
II and to implement minor editorial and/or QRD-
template related changes in the SmPC and Package 
Leaflet. A revised RMP version 9 was provided as 
part of the application.

56% (90% CI 35, 79) and 76% (90% CI 49, 108) after a 
single dose and 27% (90% CI 11, 46) and 25% (90% CI 6, 
48) at steady state, respectively. Patients taking 
concomitant medications with disposition dependent upon 
P-gp and with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin, 
dabigatran, aliskiren) should be closely monitored for signs 
of changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of 
the concomitant medication whilst receiving TAGRISSO.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 
5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated 
with a new warning with regard to increased risk of 
developing adverse events of Grade 3 or higher in 
patients > 65 years and <50 kg. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update sections 2 and 
4.4 of the SmPC with information regarding the 
excipient sodium, and to implement editorial changes 
in the SmPC and Package Leaflet.   
An updated RMP version 10.0 was agreed during the 
procedure. 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted 
by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and 
considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing 
therapies.

study AURA3 addressed the remaining Specific 
Obligation for Tagrisso and hence it is recommended

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for TAGRISSO, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the Opinion.

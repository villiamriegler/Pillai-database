Summary  of  Risk  Management  Plan  for  Yesafili  (Aflibercept)  40  mg/mL  solution  for 
injection in a vial 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Aflibercept Viatris 40 mg/mL solution 
for  injection  in  a  vial.  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of  aflibercept,  how  these  risks  can  be 
minimised, and how more information will be obtained about aflibercept's risks and uncertainties 
(missing information). 
Yesafili  (Aflibercept)  40  mg/mL  solution  for  injection  in  a  vial  's  summary  of  product 
characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare 
professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Yesafili  (Aflibercept)  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  the 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be included  in  updates  of  Yesafili 
(Aflibercept)'s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Yesafili  (Aflibercept)  40  mg/mL  solution  for  injection  in  a  vial  is  indicated  for  adults  for  the 
treatment of 
•  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
•  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO 
or central RVO), 
•  visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), 
•  visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). 
It contains aflibercept as the active substance and it is given by intravitreal injection only. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Yesafili  (Aflibercept)’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Yesafili (Aflibercept)’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of Yesafili (Aflibercept) 40 mg/mL solution for injection in a vial, together with 
measures to minimise such risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  Information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken,  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Yesafili (Aflibercept) 40 mg/mL solution 
for injection in a vial is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
In  the  case  of  Yesafili  (Aflibercept)  40  mg/mL  solution  for  injection  in  a  vial,  these  routine 
measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures, mentioned under relevant 
risks below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Yesafili (Aflibercept) 40 mg/mL solution for injection in a vial are risks that 
need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the 
medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered  to  patients.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as 
identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of Yesafili (Aflibercept) 40 mg/mL solution for injection in a vial. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient populations etc.).

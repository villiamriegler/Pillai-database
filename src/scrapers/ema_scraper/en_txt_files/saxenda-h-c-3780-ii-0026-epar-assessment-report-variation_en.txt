2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Obesity is a global public health challenge. The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents, as 
well as in adults, has been increasing steadily during the past three decades and has reached alarming 
proportions worldwide. According to an International Association for the Study of Obesity and 
International Obesity Task Force analysis, over 20% of school-aged children in the EU were estimated 
to be either overweight or obese. Childhood overweight or obesity is also an independent risk factor for 
obesity in adulthood and its associated comorbid conditions as well as reduced life expectancy. The 
American Medical Association (AMA) as well as a number of leading institutions such as the National 
Institutes of Health (1998), the Obesity Society (2008) and the American Association for Clinical 
Endocrinology (2012) now classify obesity as a disease, calling for dedicated efforts in prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment. 
Paediatric obesity is associated with a number of comorbid conditions including hypertension, type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2D), early puberty, menstrual irregularities, polycystic ovary syndrome, 
steatohepatitis, sleep apnoea, asthma, musculoskeletal disorders and psychological problems. Effective 
weight loss, subsequent weight maintenance as well as treatment and prevention of these 
comorbidities are of particular importance in the treatment of obesity. In studies conducted in 
paediatric subjects with obesity, weight loss has been associated with improvements in 
cardiometabolic risk factors, including measures of glycaemic control, beta-cell function, insulin 
sensitivity/resistance, lipid profile, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. 
Paediatric obesity remains a major public health challenge, as treatment options are limited. Although 
lifestyle modification is the recommended first-line treatment, widespread adoption of this treatment 
method and long-term compliance are problematic, and therefore treatment intensification may be 
needed. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Liraglutide is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue classified as a ‘GLP-1 receptor 
agonist’, with 97% homology to human GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food 
intake, but the exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear. Liraglutide lowers body weight in 
humans mainly through loss of fat mass with relative reductions in visceral fat being greater than 
subcutaneous fat loss. Liraglutide regulates appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and safety, while 
lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption, thereby leading to reduced food intake. 
Liraglutide has unique therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity, due to its combined effects 
not only on body weight but also on glycaemic control and other weight-related comorbidities. 
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The aim of this application is to support the extension of the indication of Saxenda for use in the 
adolescent population (aged 12 to less than 18 years) with obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m2 
for adults by international cut-off points and ≥95th percentile for age and gender). 
The paediatric development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg was designed in agreement with the  
EMA PDCO. Key binding elements for the programme were included in the paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP) agreed upon with the EMA (EMEA-000128-PIP02-09-M03).

The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
One nonclinical study was submitted with the current application, which was also submitted previously, 
and assessed in 2015 as part of a type II variation for Victoza (EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0032), namely a 
10-week repeated dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, including a 4 week recovery period. The juvenile 
toxicity study was conducted to fulfil the request in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) Opinion for 
liraglutide in the weight management indication (EMEA-000128-PIP02-09). Although the study has 
previously been submitted, that submission was not regarding a paediatric indication, and no inclusion 
of any data regarding juvenile study findings were included in the SmPC at that time. However, with 
the current indication extension for Saxenda, the data has been considered relevant for inclusion in the 
SmPC, hence, are included in section 5.3.  
A dose range study in juvenile animals (Study No JLY0395, or report number NN212267) was 
performed and submitted previously with the original MAA for Saxenda.  
Four literature references (Kennedy and Mitra 1963, Leonhardt et al. 2003, Carney et al. 2004 and 
McShane and Wise 1996) were quoted in the nonclinical overview and submitted in order to allow for 
secondary assessment.  
2.2.2.  Toxicology  
Reproduction toxicity 
In the non-GLP dose range finding study (Study no NN212267) previously submitted the following was 
concluded by the MAH: 
Subcutaneous administration of 0.1, 0.25 or 1 mg liraglutide/kg/day to juvenile Sprague Dawley rats 
from Day 21 to Day 55 of age resulted in a treatment-related reduction in food consumption and 
bodyweight gain, with males being more affected than females. Sexual maturation assessed as vaginal 
opening and balano-preputial separation was delayed in a dose-dependent manner at all tested dose 
levels. Ovary weights were also slightly reduced. 
As a consequence, the low dose was lowered to 0.05 mg/kg/day in the definitive study.  
In the definitive juvenile animal study in rats (report NN 212291), doses of 0, 0.05, 0.25 and 1.0 
mg/kg/day was administered subcutaneously to juvenile Sprague Dawley Crl:CD(SD) rats. The animals 
were 21 days old at start of treatment, and dosing was performed daily until 90 days of age.  
Three groups of ten male and ten female rats received liraglutide for ten weeks at doses of 0.05, 0.25 
or 1.0 mg/kg/day at a volume-dose of 1 mL/kg. A similarly constituted Control group received the 
vehicle, at the same volume-dose. These animals comprised the Main phase of the study. A further 
twenty males and twenty females were assigned to each group: these animals comprised the 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 8/72 
 
 
 
 
Recovery/Reproductive phase and were treated for 10 weeks at the same dose levels as the Main 
phase animals followed by a four week period without treatment to assess recovery from any 
treatment-related effects prior to a reproductive assessment. For the reproductive assessment Control 
males were paired with Control females, previously treated males were paired with specifically 
acquired untreated females, and previously treated females were paired with stock males. All females 
were allowed to litter and rear their offspring to Day 7 of age.  
An additional nine males and nine females were assigned to each treated group, and three males and 
three females to the Control group; these animals comprised the Single Dose TK phase. Animals 
received a single dose on Day 21 of age, and blood samples were taken for toxicokinetic evaluation 
only. 
During the study, clinical observations, post-dose observations, body weight, food consumption, limb 
measurements, haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, organ weight, macropathology and 
histopathology investigations were performed for Main phase and Recovery/Reproductive phase 
animals. In addition, for the Recovery/Reproductive phase animals, investigations of toxicokinetics, 
sexual maturation, neurobehaviour, oestrous cycles, mating performance and fertility, gestation length 
and parturition were undertaken. The clinical condition, litter size and survival, sex ratio, body weight 
and ano-genital distance of offspring were assessed, and macropathology investigations were 
undertaken at necropsy. 
Results 
Systemic exposure to liraglutide in the dosed animals was confirmed. The tmax was in the range of 2-4 
hours post-dosing on Day 1 and 2-8 hours during Week 10 of dosing. Cmax and AUC0-24hr increased with 
dose for both male and female animals. The increase in exposure seemed proportional to the increase 
in dose. Minor accumulation was observed for both males and females. No clear sex differences were 
observed. 
There were no unscheduled deaths related to the administration of liraglutide, and no treatment-
related changes in the clinical condition of the animals. 
Mean body weight gain of males receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day, was generally lower than control 
throughout the 10-week dosing period, particularly from Day 21-28 of age (20% and 39% lower than 
Control) and from Day 84-91 of age (26% and 39% lower than Control), with a dose-response 
apparent; during the recovery period overall mean body weight gains of these animals were greater 
than in Controls. The mean body weight gain of females receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day was lower than 
Control during the first week of dosing but thereafter body weight gain was generally similar to or 
slightly greater than in Controls until the end of the recovery period. There was no effect of previous 
treatment on body weight gain during gestation or lactation. The overall body weight gain of males 
and females receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day during the 10-week dosing period was 5% and 4% lower than 
Control, respectively, with statistical significance attained for the males. 
Mean food consumption of males receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day was lower than Controls throughout 
the 10-week dosing period but higher than Controls during the first week of recovery. Mean food 
intake for males receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day was slightly lower than Control during Week 1 of dosing 
(Days 21 to 23 of age) and marginally but statistically significantly low during Weeks 8 and 9 of 
dosing. Mean food consumption of females receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day was lower than Controls 
during the first week or first two weeks of dosing respectively, but higher than Controls during the first 
week of recovery. There was no effect of previous treatment on food consumption during gestation or 
lactation. 
Mean ulna length and growth of the ulna between Day 21 and Day 35 of age for males and females 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021

receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day was shorter than Control. 
Among females receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day, a marked dose-dependent delay in the age of 
attainment of vaginal opening was evident when compared to Controls. 
Treatment did not affect the condition or behaviour of the animals when observed in week 8-9 of 
treatment in the hand or in an arena, or their motor activity or learning and memory capacity in the 
Morris water maze. 
There were no adverse effects of treatment on haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis parameters 
at any dose level investigated. 
There was a slightly extended oestrous cycle length among females receiving 1 mg/kg/day during 
Weeks 6-8 of treatment; cycles had returned to normal length after two weeks of recovery, before 
pairing. 
Organ weight analysis after 10 weeks of treatment revealed low absolute and body weight-relative 
ovary weights among females receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day; this difference was not apparent at the 
end of the recovery period, and no treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic changes were 
detected in the ovaries. There were no other toxicologically significant or treatment-related effects on 
organ weights. 
There were no treatment-related macropathology findings at the end of treatment or during recovery. 
Microscopic examination of a full list of tissues revealed that changes related to treatment with 
liraglutide were limited to minimal hypertrophy in the duodenum’s Brunner’s gland in both sexes 
receiving 1 mg/kg/day; this change was not apparent at the end of the recovery period.  
Mating performance and fertility of both sexes and gestation length and gestation index were 
unaffected by previous treatment with liraglutide.  
The mean number of implantations and subsequent litter size was slightly low among females 
previously treated at 1 mg/kg/day which were mated with untreated stock males during the recovery 
period compared with those in the other six groups of litters on the study, although the differences 
from Control did not attain statistical significance. There was no effect of previous treatment of males 
at 1 mg/kg/day on the number of implantations or litter size in untreated females following mating. 
There was no effect of previous maternal or paternal treatment on offspring clinical condition, survival, 
ano-genital distance, sex ratio, body weight, body weight gain or macropathology findings. 
Discussion by MAH 
The repeated daily subcutaneous administration of liraglutide to juvenile rats for 10 weeks (from Day 
21 to Day 90 of age) at doses up to and including 1 mg/kg/day was well tolerated. There were no 
unscheduled deaths related to the administration of liraglutide, and no treatment-related changes in 
the clinical condition of the animals. In general, the treatment-related effects observed mirrored those 
seen in the preliminary study in juvenile rats, and predominantly related to pharmacologically-induced 
reductions in body weight gain and food intake throughout the dosing period in males receiving 0.25 or 
1 mg/kg/day, and in females in these groups predominantly during Week 1 of dosing. A concomitant 
reduction in ulna growth was apparent in these males and females during the first two weeks of 
dosing, and among the males receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day a body weight-related dose-dependent 
slight delay in the onset and completion of balano-preputial separation was observed.

Treatment of juvenile female rats from Day 21 of age with 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide affected the 
reproductive system, as indicated by: 
•  Markedly delayed vaginal opening among females receiving 0.25 or 1 mg/kg/day – these 
groups of females showed a statistically significant and dose-related decrease in mean body 
weight gain during Week 1 of treatment (Day 21-28 of age) of 26% and 39% respectively 
when compared to Control. 
•  Slightly extended oestrous cycles among females receiving 1 mg/kg/day during Weeks 6-8 of 
treatment - cycles had returned to normal two weeks after the cessation of treatment, before 
pairing. 
• 
Low absolute and body weight-relative ovary weights among females receiving 0.25 or 1 
mg/kg/day - a similar difference was not apparent at the end of the recovery period and no 
treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic changes were detected in the ovaries. 
Mating performance and fertility of both sexes were unaffected by previous treatment with liraglutide, 
but the mean number of implantations (and subsequent litter size) was slightly low among females 
who had received 1 mg/kg/day and were mated with untreated stock males during the recovery 
period. Although the differences from Control did not attain statistical significance, mean numbers of 
implantations and offspring were slightly low compared with those in the other six groups of litters on 
the study, and in view of this, and the previously detailed indications that treatment had affected the 
integrity of the female reproductive system, a relationship between these findings and previous 
treatment with liraglutide could not be discounted. This finding was not apparent when males 
previously treated at 1 mg/kg/day were mated with untreated females. There was no effect of previous 
maternal or paternal treatment on offspring clinical condition, survival, ano-genital distance, sex ratio, 
body weight or weight gain or macropathology findings. 
Following ten weeks of dosing, treatment-related minimal hypertrophy was found in the Brunner’s 
glands of the duodenum; similar histopathological changes were not apparent after the 
recovery/reproductive period. Brunner’s glands are located only in the most proximal portion of the 
duodenum adjacent to the gastric pylorus in rats and produce mucin and bicarbonate-containing 
secretum in order to increase the luminal pH of the duodenum from the acidic pH of the stomach 
(Pritam et al, 2013). The glands have been shown to have high GLP 1 receptor expression (Meike 
Korner et al., 2007). Since this subtle finding was not associated with any inflammation or cellular 
changes, the finding is considered to be of no toxicological relevance and can be regarded as a 
consequence of altered function rather than a pathological alteration.

The incidence of procedure-related microscopic changes at the injection sites was generally similar in 
control and test substance treated groups and not considered related to treatment with liraglutide. 
Treatment did not affect the condition or performance of the animals when observed in the hand or in 
an arena, or their motor activity or learning and memory capacity in the Morris water maze; an 
indication of faster trial times and lower numbers of sector entries and failed trials was evident in 
liraglutide-treated males and females, however, due to the direction of change relative to the Controls 
(improved performance) this observation was considered to be of no toxicological significance. 
Some minor differences were recorded in haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis parameters, the 
majority of which were within the historical control data range. In view of this, and since there were no 
supporting treatment-related microscopic pathology changes or effects on the clinical condition or 
survival of the animals, these differences were considered not to represent an adverse effect of 
treatment. 
The MAH concluded that daily subcutaneous administration of liraglutide to juvenile Sprague Dawley 
rats for 10 Weeks produced adverse signs of toxicity among females at a dose level of 0.25 and above, 
resulting in a marked delay in the attainment of sexual maturation at 0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day and 
slightly low implantation counts and post-partum litter size following mating at 1 mg/kg/day, for which 
a relationship to treatment could not be discounted. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect level (NOAEL) for 
juvenile female rats was therefore considered to be 0.05 mg/kg/day. There were no toxicologically 
significant changes observed among liraglutide-treated males, and it was therefore considered that the 
NOAEL for juvenile male rats was 1 mg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic data 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA has been submitted. The ERA consists of a justification for not performing any ERA studies. 
Liraglutide is a peptide consisting of natural amino acids and a natural fatty acid (palmitic acid).  
Therefore, in accordance with the guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), liraglutide is 
exempted from performing ERA studies, under the expectation that e.g. due to their nature they are 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Any increase in consumption of liraglutide, is

considered not to have any impact on the environment. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No new target organs were observed in juvenile animals. The females were most sensitive to delayed 
sexual maturation, as attainment of vaginal opening was significantly delayed in the mid and high dose 
females. The mean body weight at attainment of vaginal opening, was higher for the mid and high 
dose group females, compared to the control group.   
In the males, only slight delays were observed in the onset and completion of balano-preputial 
separation. The age at which the males attained separation of balano-preputium was within the 
historical control range for the CRO. The slight delays observed were directly correlated with slightly 
lower absolute body weight, and the mean body weight in the treated groups at completion of balano-
preputial separation was comparable to the control group mean body weight.  
None of the observations from the juvenile animal study has been initially included in the SmPC. The 
MAH stressed that food restriction during early postnatal development is well known to delay sexual 
maturation and ovary weight in rats (Kennedy and Mitra (1963), Leonhardt et al. (2003), Carney et al. 
(2004)) and prolong oestrous cycle length (McShane and Wise (1996)). As the animals fully recovered 
after cessation of treatment, the findings were therefore not considered of toxicological concern by the 
MAH. However, the MAH included the information regarding delayed sexual maturation of the females, 
especially considering the low exposure (fractional) compared to the clinically relevant exposure in 
children in SmPC section 5.3 which is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The performed juvenile animal study showed delayed attainment of vaginal opening in females treated 
with 0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered subcutaneously. In addition, the oestrus cycle 
activity was slightly extended during weeks 6-8 of treatment (4-5 or 5-day cycles in 9/20 high dose 
females). This change was not evident after 2 weeks recovery.  
Considering that liraglutide is a peptide with a fatty acid, is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The paediatric clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg builds on the data already 
available for liraglutide 3.0 mg in adults.  
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 13/72 
 
 
 
Liraglutide 3.0 mg was investigated in adolescents (aged 12 years to less than 18 years) with obesity 
in 2 trials (Table): 
•  NN8022-3967, referred to as Trial 3967: a phase 1 clinical pharmacology trial to assess the 
safety, tolerability and PK of liraglutide 3.0 mg in adolescents aged 12−17 years with obesity 
• 
Trial 4180: referred to as Trial 4180: a phase 3a efficacy and safety trial in adolescents aged 
12 years to less than 18 years with obesity. 
Both trials were designed and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good 
Clinical Practice. This clinical trial report for study NN8022-3967 was already submitted and assessed 
in 2014 under the Victoza, liraglutide 1.8 mg procedure (EMEA/H/C001026) and the Saxenda, 
liraglutide 3.0 mg), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended 
(EMA/H/C/003780/P46).

Apart from the above 2 trials, liraglutide 3.0 mg was also investigated in children (aged 7-11 years) 
with obesity (NN8022-4181, referred to as Trial 4181). Trial 4181 is not part of this submission and 
the data from this trial has been included only for population PK analyses. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose proportionality of liraglutide exposures was assessed based on Ctrough. This was done by 
estimating the slope β in a linear normal regression model with the logarithm of Ctrough as a 
dependent variable, a common intercept as a fixed factor and log dose as a fixed covariate. 
Furthermore, a subject-specific intercept was included as random effect. The estimated quantity 2β 
with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported and the resulting p-value represents the test of 2β = 2 
(i.e., if 2β = 2 this means that doubling the dose of liraglutide results in a doubling of the exposure). 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The objective of the analyses is to investigate the population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response 
relationship for weight management in adolescent subjects (12 to <18 years) with obesity treated with 
Assessment report

liraglutide in trial 4180 and to investigate if the assumption of similarity between adult and 
adolescent populations with regards to PK and exposure-response relationship can be supported. 
The population PK meta-analyses will include historical data from both adult (trial 3630, ≥ 18 years) 
and paediatric populations (trial 3967, 12 to <18 years and trial 4181, 6 to <12 years) with obesity 
to compare exposure across age groups. The analysis is an update of a previous analysis that included 
all the historical data, now with the additional data from trial 4180. 
Trial 4181: 
The trial was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and tolerability, PK 
and PD trial in children with obesity aged 6 to <12 years at Tanner stage 1. 21 subjects were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Treatment duration was at least 7 week (with 6 
optional flex weeks). BMI (body mass index) corresponded to ≥30 kg/m2 for adults by international 
cut-off points and BMI ≤45 kg/m2 as well as BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex at the time of 
signing informed consent. Treatment was initiated with liraglutide 0.3 mg daily for one week and 
increased as tolerated in weekly steps of 0.3 mg until a dose of 1.2 mg was reached, and then 0.6 mg 
until a dose of maximum 3.0 mg liraglutide was reached. The dose was escalated over 7 weeks with 
flexibility for up to 13 weeks. 
Trial 3630: 
The trial was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, incomplete cross-over design trial to 
evaluate the effects of liraglutide on gastric emptying, energy expenditure and appetite, and to 
evaluate liraglutide PK in obese adults. In total, 49 subjects were randomised in the trial. 29 subjects 
were randomised and exposed to liraglutide 3.0 mg and included in this analysis. In brief, the subjects 
included in the trial were adult (aged 18 to 75 years) males and females with a BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2 and 
< 40.0 kg/m2 and a FPG < 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Treatment with liraglutide was started at a dose 
of 0.6 mg/day. The dose was gradually increased with 0.6 mg once weekly until maintenance doses of 
either 1.8 or 3.0 mg/day were reached but for this analysis, only data from 3.0 mg liraglutide was 
used.

Table 3:  summary of demographics across trials 
Liraglutide population PK has been studied for two indications: T2D (Victoza) and weight management 
(Saxenda), both for adult and paediatric subjects. Body weight has been shown to be the most 
important covariate, being inversely related to exposure. In the population PK analysis of phase 3 data 
in adults with obesity, a small sex effect was found with higher exposure in females compared with 
males. The population PK was consistent across indications, however with a tendency for lower 
exposure in subjects with T2D. 
The first-order conditional estimation (FOCE-I) method implemented in the NONMEM software was 
used for the population PK analysis. A base model without covariates was developed based on prior 
knowledge of liraglutide PK. Next, a full model, which was the base model with all investigated 
covariates included, was estimated for the covariate analysis. All investigated covariates were 
significant except for age group. The full model could therefore not be reduced, and so, the full model 
was adopted as the final model. 
As compliance can be challenging in the adolescent population, necessary action was taken to account 
for this. For the population PK analysis, the aim was to estimate PK parameters that are relevant for a 
compliant population; hence data records with missing concentration values and data records with 
concentration values below the lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were flagged in the data file and 
excluded from the analysis. 
A standard one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was the starting point 
for the description of liraglutide PK. The structural model was parameterized in terms of the following 
(absorption rate constant) 
(apparent clearance) 
(apparent volume of distribution) 
parameters: 
•  Ka  
•  CL/F  
•  V/F  
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 17/72 
 
 
 
 
Between-subject variability was included for CL/F and V/F, assuming log-normal distributions without 
correlation between parameters. Furthermore, CL/F and V/F were estimated with a full variance-
covariance matrix. No between-subject variability was included for ka. Within-subject variability 
(residual) was described by a proportional error model. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetics of study 3967 
Dose proportionality 
In the table below (Table) the mean Ctrough values are listed of the subjects measured on each visiting 
day (escalating doses) in this study and in Figure 1. the individual data are presented and fitted to 
estimate the dose proportionality of the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide. 
Table 4: Liraglutide plasma concentration, trough values - descriptive statistics 
Figure 1: Dose proportionality based on Ctrough values (The fitted curve is based on the 
estimates from the linear regression model) 
The liraglutide concentration did not appear to increase in a dose-proportional manner, i.e. the 
estimated 2β with corresponding 95% CI was 1.75 (1.55; 1.98), p = 0.03 indicating that a doubling of 
the liraglutide dose resulted in a 1.75 times increase in exposure (Ctrough). 
Investigating the dose proportionality of liraglutide based on the Ctrough values in a linear normal 
regression model indicated that the liraglutide concentration did not increase in a dose-proportional 
manner mainly due to unexpected low Ctrough values at the 2.4 mg liraglutide dose. When excluding all

Ctrough values at the dose of 2.4 mg in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the increase in liraglutide 
concentration with increasing dose was however consistent with dose-proportionality. The reason for 
the unexpected low Ctrough values at the 2.4 mg liraglutide dose is not known. 
The results of the study in adolescent patients demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide 
could be considered linear, but not fully dose-proportional. However, the deviation from dose 
proportionality in this patient group is considered not clinically relevant. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis: 
The final dataset from study 4180 comprised 646 PK observations from 121 subjects. A total of 22 PK 
observations were excluded, due to missing times or inadequate dosing history, corresponding to 3.3% 
of the data.  A total of 94 observations were below the LLOQ, corresponding to 14.6% of the final 
dataset. 
Building on previous population PK analysis of liraglutide, a one-compartment model with first-order 
absorption and elimination was applied with values of ka, and V/F fixed to previously estimated values, 
to allow for estimation of CL/F in trial 4180 with sparse PK sampling. A confirmatory approach was 
used regarding covariates with the estimation of a base model without covariates, a full model with all 
investigated covariates and a final model including only significant covariates. In the current analysis, 
all covariates included in the full model were statistically significant except for age group. As age group 
was the covariate under investigation for this analysis, the full model was also used as the final model, 
and a reduced model with exclusion of non-significant covariates was not estimated.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis has sufficiently been described, and model diagnostics seem 
to demonstrate adequate model performance. The Applicant additionally discussed the occurrence of 
the second peak in the conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) and provided the outcome file of the 
final model run which demonstrated acceptable results and showed convergence of the model.  
Effects of intrinsic covariates on liraglutide exposure are shown in below. In accordance with previous 
findings in adults, body weight was the main intrinsic covariate for liraglutide exposure with lower 
exposure at higher body weights. Age group and sex were of no or little importance.

Figure 4: forest plot of covariate analysis for liraglutide exposure in subjects with obesity 
Individual and mean liraglutide Cavg values were similar in adolescents and adults when adjusted to 
3.0 mg dose whereas children had slightly higher concentrations. When adjusting for differences in 
body weight, exposures were similar across trials and age groups (figures below).

(A) and with (B) adjustment for body weight. 
A table of the summary of model-derived clearance (CL/F) values and average exposures across trials 
is provided below. Both the individual clearance and exposure estimates (CL/F and Cavg) were 
comparable between paediatric and adult subjects except for children who had slightly lower clearance 
and higher exposure. This difference can be partly explained by differences in body weight and the 
distribution of sex.

Table 6: summary of clearance and exposure (Cavg) estimates across trials included in the 
population PK analysis, liraglutide 3.0 mg 
The mean exposure in the exposure-response population for liraglutide dosed at 3.0 mg was similar in 
adolescents (trial 4180) and in adults (trials 1807, 1839 and 1922) with a large overlap of individual 
exposures between the two age groups, figure below. Exposures were numerically smaller in 
adolescents compared to adults, likely due to a lower degree of treatment compliance in adolescents. 
Figure 6: liraglutide steady-state exposure across trials in subjects treated with 3.0 mg 
liraglutide (A) and in all subjects with doses adjusted to 3.0 mg liraglutide (B). 
Individual observed liraglutide concentrations versus time since the latest dose revealed a number of 
lower than expected values in trial 4180. These observations could indicate compliance issues with 
some of the subjects in trial 4180. The possible lack of compliance by some subjects is also reflected in 
the summary concentrations over time as shown in the below figure. Instead of the expected constant 
exposure during steady-state maintenance dosing, exposures appeared to decrease, thus indicating a 
possible lack of compliance over time.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, the study results and population pharmacokinetic analysis indeed 
demonstrate that the exposure largely overlaps between the adolescent and adult study population. It 
is agreed that exposure associated with 3.0 mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between 
adolescent subjects in trial 4180 and previous findings of exposures across age groups.  
Model-derived clearance (CL/F) values and average exposures (Cavg) were comparable between age 
groups, except for younger children (< 12 years) who had slightly lower clearance and a higher 
exposure, which is partly explained by differences in body weight and distribution of sex. 
Steady-state exposure across trials in subjects treated with 3.0 mg liraglutide demonstrated quite a 
number of lower than expected values. The reasoning by the applicant, that it is due to compliance 
issues in this population and that in other trials a less stringent data cleaning was applied, can be 
agreed. Although it does not necessarily fully explain all lower than expected observed concentrations, 
it also very difficult to further investigate this issue.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, overall, it can be agreed that the study results and population 
pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrate that the exposure is comparable between the adolescent and 
adult study population. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
There was one Phase 3a efficacy and safety trial of liraglutide 3.0mg in adolescents with obesity (Trial 
4180). 
Trial 4180 
Methods 
Trial design 
Trial 4180 was a 56-week double-blind, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
multi-national trial followed by a 26-week off study-drug follow up period. The trial design is shown 
schematically in  
.  
The trial was conducted in pubertal adolescents with obesity aged 12 to less than 18 years. Subjects 
were randomised 1:1 to receive liraglutide or placebo as a once-daily s.c. injection. Randomisation 
was stratified according to pubertal development (Tanner staging) and glycaemic status. The trial 
consisted of a 12-week run-in period, followed by a 56-week double-blind treatment period and a 
26-week off study drug follow-up period. 
All subjects underwent counselling in healthy nutrition and physical activity for weight loss and 
were prescribed a structured programme from the beginning of the 12-week run-in period and 
continuing through the 26-week off study drug follow-up period.

Figure 9: Study 4180 Trial design 
Study participants 
The population in the Trial 4180 included pubertal adolescent male and female subjects aged 12 to less 
than 18 years with obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m2 for adults by international cut-off points 
and ≥95th percentile for age and gender). Table provides details on the international cut off points for 
body mass index for obesity by sex between 12 and 18 years, defined to pass-through body mass 
index of 30 kg/m2 at age 18, obtained by averaging data from Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, 
Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States. 
The trial was conducted at 32 sites in 5 countries (Belgium, Sweden, Russia, Mexico and USA) which 
allowed for the inclusion of subjects with different racial and ethnic backgrounds. In accordance with 
regulatory commitment in the Paediatric Investigational Plan, at least 30% of the randomised subjects 
were from countries with a lifestyle and nutrition comparable to those in the European Union.

Treatments 
Treatment with liraglutide was initiated with 0.6 mg daily for one week and increased in weekly steps 
of 0.6 mg until the 3.0 mg dose of liraglutide (highest allowed liraglutide dose) or a maximum 
tolerated dose was reached. Dose escalation was based on safety and tolerability as judged by the 
investigator. Dose escalation of the trial product was not allowed if the subject had a 
SMPG <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the presence of symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia during the week prior to or during the dose-escalation visits, or during contacts (i.e., 
via telephone). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Trial 4180 was to compare the efficacy of liraglutide versus placebo on weight 
loss in adolescent subjects with obesity after 56 weeks of treatment. 
The secondary objectives of the trial were to compare the efficacy of liraglutide versus placebo on 
glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOL-
Kids) in adolescent subjects with obesity after 30 and 56 weeks of treatment. Safety was also assessed 
at these time points. Additionally, the potential rebound effect from end of treatment at week 56 to 
week 82 was to be examined.

Sample size 
The sample size was calculated to ensure a marginal statistical power of at least 90% for the primary 
endpoint (change in BMI SDS from baseline to 56 weeks) to confirm the superiority of liraglutide to 
placebo. Based on different sample size scenarios, it was considered realistic and conservative to 
assume a treatment difference of -0.26 and SD of 0.35 with the randomised subjects. Therefore, a 
sample size of 228 subjects were planned to be randomised in order to ensure 90% power. 
Randomisation 
At randomisation (week 0), eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the 2 
treatment groups (liraglutide or placebo), using an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
The randomisation of subjects was stratified according to Tanner staging, to enable the examination of 
treatment effect across trial population subgroups. Further, dysglycaemia was expected to occur 
frequently in this trial population. As a result, stratification was also performed according to glycaemic 
status: normoglycaemia versus dysglycaemia (pre-diabetes and T2D as described below in Table8.

Placebo treatment was used as a comparator in this trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
liraglutide 3.0 mg. Both treatment arms were in combination with healthy nutrition and physical 
activity counselling. 
Blinding (masking) 
As liraglutide was administered by s.c. injections, the same route of administration was also used for 
placebo to maintain blinding. Subjects, investigators and the Novo Nordisk clinical study group were 
blinded to subject treatment until after database lock. There were no cases of unblinding of members 
of the clinical study group prior to breaking the randomisation code. 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) was used in the analysis of the efficacy endpoints and the safety analysis 
set (SAS) was used in the evaluation of safety endpoints. 
•  Full analysis set (FAS) – all randomised subjects who had received at least one dose of trial 
product and had any post-randomisation data (according to the ITT principle). Subjects in the 
FAS were analysed as randomised. 
•  Safety analysis set (SAS) – all randomised subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial 
product. Subjects in the SAS were analysed as treated. 
The primary endpoint of change from baseline in BMI SDS after 56 weeks of treatment was analysed 
using an ANCOVA model with treatment, sex, region, baseline glycaemic category, stratification factor 
for Tanner stage, and interaction between baseline glycaemic category and stratification factor for 
Tanner stage as fixed effects, and with baseline BMI SDS and age as covariates. Missing observations 
were imputed from the placebo arm based on a jump to reference multiple (x100) imputation 
approach. 
Efficacy analyses 
Results from the statistical analysis were generally presented by two-sided confidence intervals (CIs) 
with a confidence level of 95%. Superiority was claimed if the two-sided p-value was less than 5% and 
the treatment estimate favoured liraglutide. If the upper limit was below 0, superiority of liraglutide 
against placebo was concluded. 
The FAS was used in the analysis of the efficacy endpoints. 
The primary endpoint of change from baseline in BMI SDS after 56 weeks of treatment was analysed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, sex, region, baseline glycaemic 
category, stratification factor for Tanner stage and interaction between baseline glycaemic category 
and stratification factor for Tanner stage as fixed effects, with baseline BMI SDS and age as covariates. 
Missing observations were imputed from the placebo arm based on a jump to reference multiple 
(x100) imputation approach.

The following sensitivity analyses were done to address the robustness of the primary approach for 
handling of missing values:  
•  ANCOVA with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method,  
•  ANCOVA with the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method, 
•  ANCOVA without imputation by including only treatment completers, and  
•  Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) 
The changes in BMI SDS from baseline to 30 weeks and 82 weeks and from 56 weeks to 82 weeks 
were analysed using the same statistical method as used for the main analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Categorical endpoints related to BMI (percentage of subjects achieving ≥5% or ≥
10% reduction in baseline BMI at 30, 56 and 82 weeks) were analysed using a logistic regression 
model. For the other supportive secondary efficacy endpoints and an exploratory efficacy endpoint, 
changes from baseline to 30 weeks or 56 weeks were analysed using the same type of ANCOVA with 
MI as used for the main analysis of the primary endpoint, but with the baseline value of the 
corresponding variable instead of the baseline BMI SDS as covariate. 
Trial 4180 was a 56-week double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-national 
trial followed by a 26-week period off study-drug in pubertal adolescents with obesity aged 12 to less 
than 18 years. The main part of the trial consisted of a 56-week double-blind treatment period and a 
26-week follow-up period.  The design of the trial is acceptable and in line with the PIP and the EMA 
guideline on clinical evaluation of medicinal products used in weight control (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev. 
1) addendum on weight control in children. However, a randomised treatment period of 56 weeks is 
relatively short for a drug that is intended to be used for many decades. In adults, data are available 
from a double-blind, randomised trial with a treatment duration of 3.8 years. However, long term 
effects in children may be different due to the fact that organs are still in a developmental state. 
The statistical analyses in the trial design are based on an intention to treat analysis. It was requested 
also to perform a per-protocol analysis to be informed of the magnitude of the effect of liraglutide on 
obesity in treatment completers. The applicant performed an additional per-protocol analysis to 
observe the efficacy in treatment completers separately. This is in line with the previous described 
results and showed a statistically significant change of SDS BMI -0.27 with liraglutide 3.0 mg 
treatment. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 299 subjects were screened across 32 sites in 5 countries. Of these, 40 subjects were 
screen failures.  There were 259 subjects who entered the run-in period. Of these, 8 subjects were 
run-in failures, and 251 subjects were randomised; 125 subjects were randomised to the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group, and 126 subjects were randomised to the placebo group. All randomised 
subjects were exposed to randomised treatment. 
Of the 251 randomised subjects, 198 subjects (78.9%) (99 subjects each in the liraglutide and 
placebo groups) completed the trial (i.e. completed 56 weeks treatment on the trial product and did 
not withdraw from the trial at any timepoint), also termed as trial completers (Table).

Treatment completers: A total of 201 subjects (80.1%) remained on treatment and completed the 
end-of-treatment visit (week 56) without discontinuation of the trial product. These included 
101 subjects (80.8%) from the liraglutide group and 100 subjects (79.4%) from the placebo group. 
Premature discontinuation of the trial product (with or without withdrawing from the trial): 
A 
total of 50 subjects (19.9%) discontinued the trial product prematurely (24 subjects (19.2%) from 
the liraglutide group and 26 subjects (20.6%) from the placebo group). 
AEs leading to premature discontinuation of trial product: 13 subjects from the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group experienced AEs that led to premature discontinuation of trial product. Of 
these 6 subjects discontinued the trial product as well as withdrew from the trial and 7 subjects 
discontinued the trial product without withdrawing from the trial. The most common AEs that led to 
discontinuation of trial product were vomiting (6 subjects) and nausea (4 subjects). 
The most frequent reasons for withdrawal from the trial were ‘withdrawal by subject’ (5 subjects in 
the liraglutide group and 15 subjects in the placebo group) and ‘lost to follow up’ (3 subjects in the 
liraglutide group and 6 subjects in the placebo group). Further, 1 subject in the liraglutide 3.0 mg 
group had discontinued due to a protocol violation; this subject had started a treatment that based on 
the investigator’s judgement could have affected subject’s weight. 
Subjects randomised to liraglutide took doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3.0 mg or MTD 
based on their individual tolerability.

In the safety analysis set rows, subjects are summarised according to the actual          
treatment received and not randomised treatment.                                          
One subject committed suicide after visit 23 (week 46).                                
No difference was observed in premature discontinuation rates between the liraglutide group and 
placebo. A total of 80.1% completed the 56-week visit without discontinuation of the trial product. This 
is a higher percentage compared to adult studies among liraglutide indicated for obesity (~70% 
treatment completers). It is acceptable that the stopping rule was not applied during the 4180 trial. 
Although not specific for liraglutide treatment, “early responders” (in general) seem to have a larger 
BMI decrease after 56 weeks. However, a stopping rule was asked to be applied, comparable to adults 
stated in the therapeutic indications (section 4.1) of the current SmPC and according to the 
recommendations of the European Society of Endocrinology and the Paediatric Endocrine Society: 
“Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients 
have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight.”. 
Conduct of the study 
Dosing 
In Trial 4180, liraglutide was initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg daily during the first week. The dose was 
increased in weekly steps of 0.6 mg until the 3.0 mg dose of liraglutide (highest allowed liraglutide 
dose), or a maximum tolerated dose was reached. Dose escalation was based on tolerability as judged 
by the investigator. The dose was not increased if the subject had a self-measured plasma glucose 
(SMPG) <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the presence of symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia during the week prior to or during the dose-escalation visits, or during contacts (i.e., 
via telephone). The duration of the dose-escalation varied from 4−8 weeks. 
Of the 251 randomised subjects, 125 subjects were exposed to liraglutide and 126 subjects were 
exposed to placebo. Overall, the mean duration of exposure was comparable between the treatment 
groups (52.4 weeks in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 51.7 weeks in the placebo group, respectively) 
during the on-treatment period. 
Of the 125 subjects in the liraglutide group, 103 subjects (82.4%) were escalated to 3.0 mg dose (the 
highest dose level) and remained on liraglutide 3.0 mg for a median time of 92.8% through the 56 
weeks double-blind treatment period. Among the remaining 22 subjects (17.6%), 11 subjects (8.8%) 
did not reach the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose at any time point during the trial (mainly due to tolerability 
issues), and 11 subjects (8.8%) reached the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose but could not remain on the same 
dose level due to tolerability issues and the dose was subsequently lowered by the investigator 
(Table10).

The doses of liraglutide were similar to those used in adults. Given the high average body weight of 
100.8kg, which was comparable to the body weight of the adult population, this was acceptable. The 
majority of the subjects could be escalated to liraglutide 3.0mg (82.4%) and remained on this dose 
throughout the trial duration of 56-weeks (92.8%), which is a higher percentage than in the adult 
study population. 
Baseline data 
Baseline subject characteristics 
In general, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between treatment 
groups (Table11,  
Table12). The mean age at baseline was 14.5 years. There were more female subjects (59.4%) than 
male subjects (40.6%), with a comparable distribution in both treatment groups. The subjects were 
predominantly White (Caucasian) (87.6%). Most of the subjects were in the BMI subgroup of 
30.0−<35.0 kg/m2 (45.8%) followed by BMI subgroup of 35.0−<40.0 (27.9%) at baseline. The 
majority of male and female subjects in both the treatment groups were pubertal and had reached full 
sexual maturity (Tanner stage 5) (51.8%). 
Overall, the mean body weight was 100.8 kg and the mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m2. The mean height at 
baseline was 1.68 m, and the mean waist circumference was 105.93 cm. The mean BMI SDS at 
baseline was 3.17. Overall, the mean HbA1c was 5.3%, the fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 mmol/L, 
and overall, most subjects were normoglycaemic (74.1%). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 
noted to be 
117 mmHg and 72 mmHg, respectively, at baseline, with no pronounced differences between both the 
treatment groups. 
In accordance with regulatory commitment in the Paediatric Investigational Plan, at least 30% of the 
randomised subjects were from countries with a lifestyle and nutrition comparable to those in the 
European Union.

In general, demographics were well balanced between the treatment groups. However, there were 
some racial differences between the groups, with a higher percentage of white subjects in the placebo 
group compared to liraglutide (91.3 vs 84.0%). In total, there were more female subjects (59.4%) 
than male subjects (40.6%), with a comparable distribution in both treatment groups. The placebo 
group had a slightly higher BMI SDS compared to liraglutide (3.20 vs 3.14) with no differences in 
glycaemic parameters. No absolute numbers of the number of subjects with diabetes are given. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome  
Change in BMI SDS 
Change in BMI SDS from baseline (randomisation) to week 56 was the primary endpoint in Trial 4180. 
Treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg led to a significant reduction in BMI SDS from baseline 
(randomisation) to week 56. The superiority of liraglutide 3.0 mg over placebo in reducing mean 
BMI SDS from baseline to week 56 was confirmed with an ETD of -0.22 [-0.37; - 0.08]95% CI, p=0.0022 
No statistically significant difference in BMI SDS from baseline was observed between the treatment 
groups at week 82 (TableTable 13: 
Change in BMI SDS from baseline - ANCOVA - MI - full analysis 
set). The estimated treatment difference was statistically significant in favour of liraglutide 3.0 mg 
when compared with placebo. The robustness of the primary analysis results (i.e. superiority of 
liraglutide 3.0 mg to placebo in reducing BMI SDS at week 56 from baseline) was supported by 
sensitivity analyses Figure. 
Treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in BMI SDS from 
baseline to week 30 compared to placebo (ETD at week 30: -0.21 [-0.30; -0.12]95% CI, p<0.0001).  
The observed mean BMI SDS at baseline was 3.14 in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 3.20 in the 
placebo group. After 56 weeks of treatment, the observed mean BMI SDS was 2.88 in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 3.14 in the placebo group. The observed mean change in BMI SDS from 
baseline to week 56 was -0.25 in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and -0.02 in the placebo group. The 
mean change in BMI SDS by treatment week is plotted in Figure.

Change in BMI SDS from baseline - statistical analysis - primary and 
Change in BMI SDS from week 56 to week 82 (off-study-drug follow-up period) 
At week 56, the observed mean BMI SDS for treatment completers was 2.87 in the liraglutide 3.0 mg 
group  and  the  3.10 in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  off-study-drug  follow-up  period,  the  observed  mean 
change in BMI SDS was +0.22 in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and +0.08 in the placebo group. 
In  the  off-study-drug  follow-up  period,  the  estimated  mean  change  in  BMI  SDS  was  0.22  in  the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 0.07 in the placebo group. The ETD for the change in BMI SDS from week 56 
to  week 82  was  0.15  [0.07; 0.23]95%CI,  p=0.0002.  Thus,  a  significant  increase  in  BMI  SDS  (weight 
regain) was seen from week 52 to week 82 for liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo after drug discontinuation

Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction BMI SDS from baseline to week 56 (-0.23), corresponding 
to a change in body weight of -2.26kg. This reduction did not maintain during the 26-week follow-up 
period  (-0.03).  In  the  placebo  group,  BMI  SDS  did  not  change  after  56-weeks  and  slightly  increased 
during the follow-up period (0.08). The clinical relevance of the reduction in BMI SDS in the treatment 
group is uncertain. In general, improvement in body composition and cardiometabolic risk can be seen 
with  BMI  SDS  reductions  of  ≥0.25  in  obese  adolescents,  while  greater  benefits  accrue  from  losing  at 
least 0.5 BMI SDS (Ford et al. 2010). In this study, the authors observed no improvement in mean waist 
circumference SDS or body fat SDS with a BMI SDS reduction of >0 to <0.25. Improvement by ≥0.25 
was associated with small reductions in mean waist circumference SDS and body fat SDS. Concomitant 
with these findings, they observed significant improvements in the key metabolic risk factors triglyceride, 
LDL-C and hs-CRP levels (30%, 15% and 45%, respectively) with a minimum loss of ≥0.5 BMI SDS. 
Improvements were also seen (13%, 12% and 11%) for losses of between ≥0.25 and <0.5. A similar 
picture  emerged  with  insulin  sensitivity  and  blood  pressure  with  losses  of  ≥0.25  BMI  SDS  associated 
with a significant reduction. The applicant was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of the observed 
reduction in BMI SDS and should discuss whether there is a prespecified subgroup with relevant clinical 
benefit  from  treatment  of  liraglutide  or  not.  Moreover,  it  was  not  clear  whether  the  observed  weight 
reduction  is  only  seen  in  subjects  suffering  from  gastro-intestinal  side  effects,  suggesting  that  the 
beneficial effect is mainly caused by adverse effects of liraglutide. A subgroup analysis in subjects with 
and without gastrointestinal side effects was warranted. The sub-group analyses showed that treatment 
with liraglutide 3.0 in subjects with GI adverse events resulted in a change in BMI SDS -0.26 compared 
with placebo treatment. A comparable result was observed in the group without GI adverse events, i.e. 
BMI SDS -0.23, and the interaction test was not significant. We therefore conclude that also without GI 
symptoms a comparable treatment effect is achieved. 
Additionally, a per-protocol analysis was requested to observe the effect of liraglutide in subjects who 
completed the treatment period successfully. The applicant performed an additional per-protocol 
analysis to observe the efficacy in treatment completers separately. This is in line with the previous 
described results and showed a statistically significant change of SDS BMI -0.27 with liraglutide 3.0 mg 
treatment. 
BMI, body weight, waist circumference and waist-to-hip circumference ratio 
The  results  for  the  weight-related  parameters  (BMI,  body  weight  and  waist  circumference)  were  all 
consistent with those for BMI SDS. Treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in BMI (kg/m2), body weight (% and kg) and waist circumference from baseline to weeks 30 
and 56 compared to placebo (Table14). However, the change from baseline in waist-to-hip circumference 
ratio was not statistically significant between the treatment groups at weeks 30 and 56.

At weeks 30, 56 and 82, the estimated proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in BMI of ≥5% 
or ≥10% from baseline was greater in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group than in the placebo group. The 
odds for reaching a ≥5% or ≥10% reduction in BMI at weeks 30 and 56 were statistically significantly 
greater with liraglutide 3.0 mg than with placebo. There was no statistically significant reduction (≥5% 
or ≥10%) in BMI at week 82 (Tabl).

During the treatment period liraglutide 3.0 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in BMI 
(kg/m2) (ETD: -1.58 kg/m2 [-2.47; -0.69]), body weight (ETD: -4.50 kg [-7.17; -1.84]) and waist 
circumference (ETD: -2.93 cm [-5.24; -0.63]) compared to placebo. The estimated proportion of 
subjects who achieved a reduction in BMI of ≥5% or ≥10% from baseline was greater in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group than in the placebo group (≥5%: 43.25 vs 18.73% and ≥10%: 26.08 vs 8.11% at 56-
weeks). However, these numbers were lower compared to the adult population whereas 63.5% of the 
subjects in the liraglutide 3.0mg group received a reduction in BMI of ≥5% and 32.8% ≥10% after 56-
weeks (SCALE Obesity & Pre-Diabetes – Trial 1839). In contrast with the adult study, no early 
response in BMI reduction was measured after 12 weeks which is defined as early responders and was 
a predictive factor for long-term weight reduction in adults. 
Cardiometabolic parameters 
No statistically significant differences in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fasting lipid values 
and blood pressure were observed between the treatment groups from baseline to weeks 30 and 56 (

At week 56, the observed mean HbA1c was 5.2% in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 5.3% in the 
placebo group. In the off-study-drug follow-up period, the observed mean change in HbA1c was 0.1%-
points in both the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups.  
At week 56, the observed mean FPG was 5.1 mmol/L in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 5.2 mmol/L in 
the placebo group. In the off-study-drug follow-up period, the observed mean change in FPG was 
+0.1 mmol/L in both the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups.  
Fasting C-peptide, Fasting insulin, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR 
No statistically significant treatment differences in fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin, homeostasis 
model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR) were observed between the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups at weeks 30 
and 56.  
Glycaemic category 
At baseline (week -2), the proportion of subjects who were normoglycaemic was comparable between 
the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups (74.4% vs. 73.8%). The estimated proportion of subjects 
who were normoglycaemic was higher in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group than in the placebo group at 
week 30 (86.72% vs. 76.16%) and week 56 (84.60% vs. 74.66%). However, the odds of being 
normoglycaemic at weeks 30 and 56 were not statistically significant between the treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects who were normoglycaemic at baseline (week -2) and progressed to a pre-
diabetic state was lower in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared to the placebo group at week 30 
(5.6% vs. 10.3%) and this proportion was similar between the treatment groups at week 56 (8.0% vs. 
7.1%). 
The proportion of subjects who were pre-diabetic at baseline (week -2) and reverted to a 
normoglycaemic state was higher in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared to placebo group at week 
30 (13.6% vs. 10.3%) and week 56 (12.8% vs. 7.1%). 
The proportion of subjects who were pre-diabetic at baseline (week -2) and progressed to a type 2 
diabetic state at weeks 30 and 56 was lower (range of 0−0.8%) and did not differ between the 
treatment groups. 
Greater reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were observed with liraglutide than with 
placebo at week 30 (ETD: -0.10%-points [-0.17; -0.04]). After 56-weeks of treatment, the ETD in 
HbA1c was not statistically significant (ETD: -0.06%-points [-0.14; -0.01]). There were no significant 
changes in fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function

observed regarding shifts in glycaemic categories during the treatment period between liraglutide and 
placebo. However, no absolute numbers of diabetic subjects are shown. 
Patient reported outcome - Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOL Kids) 
The IWQOL-Kids questionnaire was used to assess the weight-related quality of life in adolescents. The 
following four domain scores and a total score was calculated: 
Physical comfort 
• 
•  Body esteem 
•  Social life 
• 
Family relations. 
There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in any of the 4 domain 
scores or in the total score of IWQOL-kids from baseline to week 30 and week 56 (Figure12).

Clinical studies in special populations 
In this trial no subgroup analyses in special populations were performed with respect to age, 
(pre)diabetes, Tanner stage, gender, BMI groups etc.  The applicant was requested to perform 
subgroup analyses in different age and BMI groups, gender, underlying (pre) diabetes, and Tanner 
stages which are essential to give more insight of the effects of liraglutide in different subgroups. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for different parameters at baseline (age group, BMI category, 
ethnicity, glycaemic status, waist circumference, race, sex, and Tanner stage) and the results indicated 
that there were no significant subgroup interactions. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Trial 4180 was a 56-week double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-national 
trial followed by a 26-week period off study-drug in pubertal adolescents with obesity aged 12 to less 
than 18 years. The main part of the trial consisted of a 56-week double-blind treatment period and a 
26-week follow-up period.   
The design of the trial is acceptable and in line with the PIP and the EMA guideline on clinical 
evaluation of medicinal products used in weight control (CPMP/EWP/281/96 Rev. 1) addendum on 
weight control in children. However, a randomised treatment period of 56 weeks is relatively short for 
a drug that potentially is for long-term use. 
The statistical analyses in the trial design are based on an intention to treat analysis. It was requested 
to also perform a per protocol analysis to be informed of the magnitude of the effect of liraglutide on 
obesity in treatment completers.  
The doses of liraglutide were similar to those used in adults. Given the high average body weight of 
100.8kg, which is comparable to the adult study population, this was acceptable. The majority of the 
subjects could be escalated to liraglutide 3.0mg (82.4%) and remained on this dose throughout the 
trial duration of 56-weeks (92.8%), which is a higher percentage than in the adult population.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
In general, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between treatment 
groups. The mean age at baseline was 14.5 years. There were more female subjects (59.4%) than 
male subjects (40.6%), with a comparable distribution in both treatment groups. The subjects were 
predominantly White (Caucasian) (87.6%). Most of the subjects were in the BMI subgroup of 
30.0−<35.0 kg/m2 (45.8%) followed by BMI subgroup of 35.0−<40.0 (27.9%) at baseline. The 
majority of male and female subjects in both the treatment groups were pubertal and had reached full 
sexual maturity (Tanner stage 5) (51.8%). 
Overall, the mean body weight was 100.8 kg, and the mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m2. The mean height at 
baseline was 1.68 m, and the mean waist circumference was 105.93 cm. The mean BMI SDS at 
baseline was 3.17. Mean HbA1c was 5.3%, the fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 mmol/L, and overall, 
most 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 48/72 
 
 
 
 
subjects were normoglycaemic (74.1%).  
Of the 299 screened subjects, 251 were randomised (1:1); 125 subjects to the liraglutide group and 
126 subjects were exposed to placebo. No difference was observed in premature discontinuation rates 
between the liraglutide group and placebo. A total of 80.1% completed the 56-week visit without 
discontinuation of the trial product. This is a higher percentage compared to adult studies among 
liraglutide indicated for obesity (~70% treatment completers). The stopping rule: “Treatment with 
Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients have not lost at 
least 5% of their initial body weight.” stated in the therapeutic indications (section 4.1) of the current 
SmPC for adults has not been applied in trial 4180 but a similar statement is now included in the final 
SmPC. This was adapted to a slightly lower percentage, i.e. 4% according to the Endocrine Society 
Guidelines (Styne et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2017), taking in account the growth of 
adolescents and the change in weight-related to that.  
BMI SDS 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction in BMI SDS from baseline to week 56 (-0.23), 
corresponding to a change in body weight of -2.26kg. This reduction was not maintained during the 
26-week follow-up period (-0.03).  
In the placebo group, BMI SDS did not change after 56-weeks and slightly increased during the follow-
up period (0.08). In general, improvement in body composition and cardiometabolic risk can be seen 
with BMI SDS reductions of ≥0.25 in obese adolescents, while greater benefits accrue from losing at 
least 0.5 BMI SDS (Ford et al. 2010). The applicant was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of 
the observed reduction in BMI SDS and whether there is a prespecified subgroup with relevant clinical 
benefit from treatment of liraglutide.   
The observed reduction in BMI SDS was evident after 2−4 weeks of treatment with nadir reached after 
approximately 42 weeks, whereas a subsequent increase in BMI SDS seemed to be evident from nadir 
to week 56. The MAH discussed the reason for and potential clinical relevance of the observed increase 
in BMI SDS following week 42 in patients randomised to liraglutide 3.0 mg. The MAH explained that 
the observed increase in BMI SDS following week 42 could be explained by the decrease in adherence 
of treatment of liraglutide 3.0 mg. This was supported by the data showing the liraglutide 
concentrations and a larger proportion of the subjects that reach the lower limit of quantification at 56 
weeks compared to at 8 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. In addition, the MAH discussed the clinical 
relevance of the rebound effect in terms of weight regain observed after cessation of liraglutide 
treatment.  Based on current knowledge, it is not possible to predict whether treatment with liraglutide 
3.0 mg could be discontinued after a certain amount of time in adolescents, especially keeping in mind 
the chronic nature of the disease. Therefore, it is important that a patient population that will benefit 
most from the treatment is identified and added stopping rule used. 
Another uncertainty was whether the observed weight reduction is only seen in subjects suffering from 
gastro-intestinal side effects, concluding that the beneficial effect is mainly caused by adverse effects 
of liraglutide. A subgroup analysis in subjects with and without gastro-intestinal side effects was 
warranted to explore this possibility. The sub-group analyses showed that treatment with liraglutide 
3.0 in subjects with GI adverse events resulted in a change in BMI SDS -0.26 compared with placebo 
treatment. A comparable result was observed in the group without GI adverse events, i.e. BMI SDS -
0.23, and the interaction test was not significant. Therefore it was concluded that also without GI 
symptoms a comparable treatment effect was achieved.    
In adults, liraglutide is possibly less effective in males and in subjects with underlying diabetes 
regarding the treatment effect for obesity. The applicant was requested to perform subgroup analyses 
Assessment report

Page 49/72 
 
 
 
 
in different age and BMI groups, gender, underlying (pre)diabetes, and Tanner stages which are 
essential to give more insight of the effects of liraglutide in different subgroups. Subgroup analyses 
were performed for different parameters at baseline (age group, BMI category, ethnicity, glycaemic 
status, waist circumference, race, sex, and Tanner stage) and the results indicated that there were no 
significant subgroup interactions. 
Change in BMI and body weight 
During the treatment period liraglutide 3.0 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in BMI 
(kg/m2) (ETD: -1.58 kg/m2 [-2.47; -0.69]), body weight (ETD: -4.50 kg [-7.17; -1.84]) and waist 
circumference (ETD: -2.93 cm [-5.24; -0.63]) compared to placebo. The estimated proportion of 
subjects who achieved a reduction in BMI of ≥5% or ≥10% from baseline was greater in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group than in the placebo group (≥5%: 43.25 vs 18.73% and ≥10%: 26.08 vs 8.11% at 56-
weeks). However, these numbers were lower compared to the adult population whereas 63.5% of the 
subjects in the liraglutide 3.0mg group received a reduction in BMI of ≥5% and 32.8% ≥10% after 56-
weeks (SCALE Obesity & Pre-Diabetes – Trial 1839).  
In contrast with the adult study, no early response in BMI reduction was measured after 12 weeks 
which is defined as early responders and which shows to be a predictive factor for long-term weight 
reduction in adults.  
Glycaemic parameters 
Greater reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were observed with liraglutide than with 
placebo at week 30 (ETD: -0.10%-points [-0.17; -0.04]). After 56-weeks of treatment, the ETD in 
HbA1c was not statistically significant (ETD: -0.06%-points [-0.14; -0.01]). There were no significant 
changes in fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function 
(HOMA-B) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). No differences were 
observed regarding shifts in glycaemic categories during the treatment period between liraglutide and 
placebo. However, no absolute numbers of diabetic subjects are shown. 
Other outcome measures 
There were no statistically significant changes in cardiometabolic parameters. There were no 
statistically significant differences in IWQOL-kids with liraglutide compared to placebo. 
In adults, efficacy may be different between men and women and in patients with underlying diabetes. 
Efficacy was not reported in paediatric males and females separately. There were no subgroup 
analyses performed with respect to age, (pre)diabetes, Tanner stage, gender and BMI groups and 
these were requested and provided; the results indicated that there were no significant subgroup 
interactions. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In 251 adolescent subjects with obesity, 56-weeks of treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of 
liraglutide (3.0mg) was associated with a reduction in BMI SDS compared to placebo (ETD: -0.22 [-
0.37; -0.08]), corresponding with a weight loss of -2.26kg in the liraglutide group. The results for the 
weight-related parameters (BMI, body weight and waist circumference) were all consistent with those 
for the BMI SDS. The clinical relevance of the observed reduction in BMI SDS was uncertain as no 
statistically significant cardiometabolic improvement is observed and the differences in weight loss are 
small compared to adults (body weight: -7.8 kg with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. -2.5 kg with placebo). The 
applicant was requested to further justify the benefit-risk and discuss which patients would benefit 
most from this treatment. In addition to the stopping rule added, subgroup analyses were performed 
Assessment report

for different parameters at baseline (age group, BMI category, ethnicity, glycaemic status, waist 
circumference, race, sex, and Tanner stage) and the results indicated that there were no significant 
subgroup interactions. 
A subgroup analysis in subjects with and without gastrointestinal side effects was warranted to explore 
whether the reduction observed in BMI SDS is solely dependent on gastrointestinal side effects from 
treatment with liraglutide. The sub-group analyses showed that treatment with liraglutide 3.0 in 
subjects with GI adverse events resulted in a change in BMI SDS -0.26 compared with placebo 
treatment. A comparable result was observed in the group without GI adverse events, i.e. BMI SDS -
0.23, and the interaction test was not significant. Therefore it was concluded that also without GI 
symptoms a comparable treatment effect was achieved.    
The observed reduction in BMI SDS was evident after 2−4 weeks of treatment with nadir reached after 
approximately 42 weeks, whereas a subsequent increase in BMI SDS seemed to be evident from nadir 
to week 56. The MAH discussed the reason for and potential clinical relevance of the observed increase 
in BMI SDS following week 42 in patients randomised to liraglutide 3.0 mg. The MAH explained that 
the observed increase in BMI SDS following week 42 could be explained by the decrease in adherence 
of treatment of liraglutide 3.0 mg. This was supported by the data showing the liraglutide 
concentrations and a larger proportion of the subjects that reach the lower limit of quantification at 56 
weeks compared to at 8 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. 
In addition, the MAH discussed the clinical relevance of the rebound effect in terms of weight regain 
observed after cessation of liraglutide treatment. Based on current knowledge, it is not possible to 
predict whether treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg could be discontinued after a certain amount of time 
in adolescents, especially keeping in mind the chronic nature of the disease. Therefore, it is important 
that a patient population that will benefit most from the treatment is identified and added stopping rule 
used. 
Compared to the largest trial performed in adults (SCALE Obesity & Pre-Diabetes – trial 1839), the 
effects of liraglutide on obesity in adolescents are lower with 63.5% of the adult subjects losing ≥ 5% 
body weight after 56-weeks compared to 43.25% in adolescents, corresponding with a reduction of -
2.26kg in adolescents vs. -7.8kg in adults in the liraglutide 3.0mg group after 56 weeks. The 
difference in an achieved weight reduction of Saxenda between adults in the SCALE trial 1839 and 
adolescent in the 4180 trial was discussed. In adolescents, a lower percentage achieved a BMI 
reduction of ≥ 5%, but the mean percentage of BMI reduction was comparable. i.e. trial 4180 5.01% 
vs. trial 1839 5.39%. It was conceivable that the difference in population, i.e. growing adolescents, 
and difference in trial protocol with the use of a maximum tolerated dosage, may explain part of these 
findings in adolescents.   
Small reductions in glycaemic parameters were seen with liraglutide at 30-weeks compared to placebo. 
However, at 56-weeks of treatment, these effects remained no longer statistically significant. No 
absolute numbers of the account of diabetic subjects are given, and no subgroup analysis in this 
special population is performed. Therefore, the MAH provided data regarding the prevalence of 
(pre)diabetes in both treatment groups and the distribution between the group was equal. Additionally, 
no subgroup analyses have been performed in different age groups, BMI groups, Tanner stage and 
with respect to gender. Efficacy analyses were asked and reported in these different subgroups with no 
significant subgroup interactions noted.  
There were no statistically significant differences regarding cardiometabolic parameters and IWQOL-
kids measurement.  
A randomised treatment period of 56 weeks is relatively short for a drug that potentially is for long-
term use. Additionally, a per-protocol analysis was warranted to observe the efficacy in treatment

completers separately. The applicant performed an additional per-protocol analysis to observe the 
efficacy in treatment completers separately. This is in line with the previous described results and 
showed a statistically significant change of SDS BMI -0.27 with liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment. 
In line with the adult indication the applicant added a similar stopping rule in the SmPC for adolescents 
as well. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the evaluation of safety, results from the larger phase 3a trial (Trial 4180) are given primary focus 
and are described in the following sections. Trial 3967 showed that liraglutide (0.6−3.0 mg) was safe 
and well-tolerated in adolescent subjects with obesity aged 12−17 years, with a safety profile similar 
to that in adults with obesity. 
In Trial 3967, treatment with liraglutide was initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg/day, and the dose was 
escalated by 0.6 mg in weekly steps over a period of 5 weeks to a maximum of 3.0 mg/day. Dose 
escalation was based on tolerability as judged by the investigator (Trial 3967). 
Both Trial 3967 and Trial 4180 were conducted in a representative sample of the patient population 
expected to be treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg. 
The secondary safety objective of the Trial 4180 was to compare the safety of liraglutide versus 
placebo in adolescent subjects with obesity after 30 and 56 weeks of treatment. All safety endpoints in 
this trial addressed the secondary objective and included adverse events, anti-liraglutide antibodies, 
bone age assessment, laboratory parameters related to safety, clinical evaluations, height/growth-
related parameters, vital signs, pubertal progression and mental health assessed by Columbia 
Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and Patient-Reported Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The 
MedDRA searches based on standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs), SOCs, HLGTs, HLTs and/or PTs 
were specified for pre-defined safety areas of interest (Trial 4180). 
Hypoglycaemia episodes described in this document are treatment-emergent. An event (or episode) 
was defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of trial 
product administration, and no later than 14 days after the last day on trial product. Hypoglycaemic 
episodes were also classified according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/ international 
society for paediatric and adolescent diabetes (ISPAD) and Novo Nordisk classification. The ADA/ISPAD 
classified hypoglycaemic episodes included all reported hypoglycaemia.  
All AEs were coded using MedDRA version 22.0. Event rates were calculated as events per 1000 PYE. 
Patient exposure 
Of the 299 screened subjects, 251 were randomized (1:1); 125 subjects were randomized to the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg arm and 126 subjects to the placebo arm. All randomised subjects were exposed to 
the randomised treatment. A total of 201 subjects (80.1%) remained on treatment and completed the 
end-of-treatment visit (week 56) without discontinuation of the trial product. These included 101 
subjects (80.8%) from the liraglutide group and 100 subjects (79.4%) from the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 52/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The majority of subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group (103 out of 125 subjects, 82.4%) were 
escalated to a 3.0 mg dose and remained on the same dose for 92.8% of median time through the 
56 weeks double-blind treatment period, suggesting that liraglutide was overall well-tolerated in the 
adolescent population. Among the remaining 22 subjects (17.6%), 11 subjects (8.8%) did not reach 
the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose at any time point during the trial (mainly due to tolerability issues), and 11 
subjects (8.8%) reached the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose but could not remain on the same dose level due 
to tolerability issues and the dose was subsequently lowered by the investigator. 
A total of 50 subjects (19.9%) discontinued the trial product prematurely (24 subjects (19.2%) from 
the liraglutide group and 26 subjects (20.6%) from the placebo group). 
Overall, a total of 198 subjects (78.9%) (99 subjects each in the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo 
groups) completed the trial (i.e. completed 56 weeks on trial product and did not withdraw from the 
trial), indicating a higher than expected retention rate in this trial population. 
Adverse events 
The AE data was categorised based on the following time points: 
On-treatment period: Events with an onset date between the first day of trial product administration 
and any of the following date, whichever came first: 
•  14 days after the last day on the trial product, or 
• 
• 
last study visit (subjects withdrawn without follow-up visit) 
follow-up visit (Visit 26) for subjects with trial product discontinued, or 
In trial period: Events with an onset date between the first day of trial product administration and 
the last study visit. 
During the ‘on-treatment period’, a total of 777 and 627 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
were reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg and the placebo groups, respectively (T). The majority of TEAEs 
in both treatment groups were non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, judged as unlikely to be 
related to the trial product by the investigator and had an outcome of ‘recovered’ or ‘recovering’. A 
higher number of TEAEs judged by the investigator as probably or possibly related to treatment 
occurred in liraglutide treated, compared to placebo-treated subjects. This imbalance was primarily 
driven by gastrointestinal AEs (GI TEAEs) (primarily nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group. The proportion of subjects with TEAEs and the rate of AEs were higher in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group compared to the placebo group (6187.8 versus 5018.5 events per 1000 PYE). During the 
‘in-trial period’, 910 and 752 AEs were reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups, 
respectively (Trial 4180). Overall, the AE pattern/distribution in both treatment groups was similar for 
the ‘in-trial’ period and the ‘on treatment’ period.

The nature and frequency of the most commonly reported TEAEs during the ‘on-treatment period’ were 
very similar to AEs seen during the in-trial period. The following preferred terms were more frequently 
reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group than the placebo group: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
gastroenteritis and dizziness ( 
Figure13). Of the most frequently reported AEs, none were serious, most were of mild to moderate 
severity and the majority of AEs had an outcome of ‘recovered’ or ‘recovering’. Gastrointestinal 
disorders were reported by a higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared to 
the placebo group during the on- treatment period (64.8%, 2540.4 events per 100 PYE and 36.5%, 
968.5 events per 100 PYE, respectively). The following preferred terms were more frequently reported 
in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group than the placebo group: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis 
and dizziness. The other frequently reported AEs were either more frequently reported in the placebo 
group or there was no difference between the treatment groups. Although, the AE rate was found to be 
high within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, the GI tolerability to the trial product 
(liraglutide 3.0 mg) improved over the course of the trial (Figure 14).

The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well as the AE rate, 
were higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire treatment period: 
64.8%, 2540.4 events per 100 PYE and 36.5%, 968.5 events per 100 PYE, respectively (Trial 4180). 
The incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group during 
the initial 8 weeks of treatment. It then remained comparable between the treatment groups until the 
end of the entire treatment period. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One subject in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group died by suicide after ~339 days of exposure to the trial 
product, during the ‘on-treatment’ period. This was the only SAE with a fatal outcome during the trial 
(Trial 4180). The Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assessment did not indicate any 
suicidal ideation/behaviour in this subject prior to the occurrence of the SAE. The event was considered 
to be unlikely related to the trial product as judged by the investigator.  
Serious adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs, as well as the event rate was higher in the placebo group than in 
the liraglutide 3.0 mg group during both the on-treatment and in-trial periods (Trial 4180, Table). 
A total of 15 SAEs (4 SAEs in liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 11 SAEs in the placebo group) were 
reported during the ‘in-trial’ period. 
During the ‘on-treatment’ period, 3 SAEs were reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and were all 
assessed as unlikely related to the trial product by the investigator. One (1) non-treatment-emergent 
SAE of suicide attempt (unlikely related to the trial product) was reported in the placebo group on trial 
day 484, during the 26-weeks off-study-drug follow-up period. One (1) non treatment-emergent SAE

of suicide attempt (unlikely related to the trial product) was reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group on

Most treatment-emergent SAEs were single events, with no specific event driving the small numerical 
imbalance. Since the number of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was low overall, any 
numerical differences should be interpreted with caution. Except for the fatal outcome resulting from 
the SAE of ‘completed suicide’, all of the remaining 8 treatment-emergent SAEs in either treatment 
group were reported as recovered. None of the other treatment-emergent SAEs led to permanent 
discontinuation of the trial product and/or trial withdrawal. 
All of the non-treatment-emergent SAEs had an outcome of ‘recovered’ and were judged to be unlikely 
related to the trial product by the investigator (including the 2 suicide attempts). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety 
laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones and bone metabolism). 
Anti-liraglutide antibodies were measured at the following timepoints in subjects randomized and 
treated with liraglutide in Trial 4180: 
•  week 0 (baseline) 
•  week 30 
•  week 56 (end of the double-blind treatment period) 
•  week 58 (2 weeks after cessation of the trial product) 
•  week 70 
•  week 82 (end of the follow-up period). 
A small number of subjects (14 subjects) developed anti-liraglutide antibodies at some point during 
the clinical trial. 
•  At week 56, 5 subjects (4.9%) were antibody positive.  
• 
In the follow-up period, two weeks after cessation of trial product (week 58), 11 subjects 
(9.7%) were antibody positive.  
•  By the end of the follow-up period, at week 82, 2 subjects remained antibody positive (2.0%). 
Both the small number of subjects (14 subjects) with anti-liraglutide antibodies and the low antibody 
levels (<9.1% B/T) preclude a conclusion regarding the effect of the observed immune response. 
Given the low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising effect, it is unlikely that antibody 
development had an impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 1 year of treatment.

There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between the liraglutide 3.0 mg 
and placebo groups in hormonal levels (luteinising hormone [LH], follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] 
and oestradiol). There were no apparent clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences 
between the treatment groups in bone age assessments and other safety laboratory parameters. 
Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) 
It is well-described that GLP-1 RAs are associated with increased levels of pancreatic enzymes 
(amylase and lipase). In Trial 4180, minor elevations in the mean amylase and lipase levels, compared 
to baseline and to placebo, were seen during 56 weeks of treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg. No 
subjects had amylase levels >3×ULN in this trial. There were 4 subjects (2 subjects in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group and 2 subjects in the placebo group) with increased levels of lipase (above 3×ULN). 
The clinical significance of pancreatic enzyme small elevations with liraglutide is unknown in the 
absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. 
Vital signs, physical findings, mental health assessment and other observations related to 
safety 
There was a statistically significant difference observed between the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo 
groups with respect to change in the resting pulse from baseline to week 30, however, there was no 
statistically significant difference observed between the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups with 
respect to change in the resting pulse from baseline to week 56. 
There were no ‘acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group. There 
were 5 acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in 3 subjects in the placebo group during the in-
trial period. 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between the liraglutide 3.0 mg 
and placebo groups in physical examination, electrocardiogram, as well as parameters related to 
pubertal progression, growth/height and mental health assessment during the trial.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse event leading to premature trial product discontinuation 
The most common AEs in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group that led to trial product discontinuation were 
vomiting and nausea. Other reported AEs that led to discontinuation included abdominal pain upper, 
abdominal discomfort, pancreatitis, depression, retching, injection site pain, and pancreatic enzymes 
increased. 
During the ‘on-treatment’ period, 6 subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg experienced TEAEs that led to 
premature discontinuation of trial product and withdrawal from the trial. Seven subjects in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group experienced an AE that led to premature discontinuation of the trial product 
but did not withdraw from the trial. All AEs that led to premature discontinuation of the trial product 
had an outcome of ‘recovered’ with the exception of the SAE with a fatal outcome due to ‘completed 
suicide’.  
There were no AEs that led to premature discontinuation of the trial product in the placebo group. 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
In total, 17 subjects experienced AEs that led to dose reduction of trial product (during the ‘on-
treatment’ period), all in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group. The most commonly reported AE belonged to 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 58/72 
 
 
 
 
 
the SOC of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and primarily included events of vomiting and nausea. These 
GI AEs were considered to be possibly or probably related to trial product (liraglutide 3.0 mg) by the 
investigator. Most of these GI AEs and other reported AEs leading to dose reduction primarily occurred 
during dose escalation (the first 4-8 weeks of treatment) with the exception of 2 events (abdominal 
discomfort and irritable bowel syndrome) that had a late onset (beyond 8 weeks).  
Adverse events leading to temporary treatment discontinuation 
Few AEs leading to temporary discontinuation of liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo were reported on 
treatment period (9 subjects [7.2%] reported 16 AEs in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 
5 subjects [4.0%] reported 6 AEs in the placebo group).  
The most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group were from the SOC 
‘Gastrointestinal disorders’. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes 
Both in the on-treatment and in-trial period, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic 
episodes (per ADA/ISPAD and Novo Nordisk classification) and the episode rates, were higher in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group than in the placebo group (Table24). 
A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group (78 events in 26 subjects, 20.8% of 
subjects, event rate was 621.2 episodes per 1000 PYE) reported hypoglycaemic episodes (per 
ADA/ISPAD and Novo Nordisk classification) compared to the placebo group (28 events in 18 subjects, 
14.3% of subjects, event rate was 224.1 episodes per 1000 PYE. 
As per the ADA/ISPAD classification, there were 31 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes 
in 19 subjects (15.2%) in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and 6 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic 
episodes in 5 subjects (4.0%) in the placebo group. As per the Novo Nordisk classification, there were 
4 symptomatic BG confirmed episodes in 3 subjects (2.4%) in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group and none in 
the placebo group. No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo 
group.

Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing safety data for liraglutide received by Novo Nordisk A/S are made available in 
Periodic Safety Update Reports/Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PSUR/PBRER) according to 
the regulatory requirements. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In general, the results of Trial 4180 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable 
to that in obese adults. However, a randomised treatment period of 56 weeks is relatively short for a 
drug that could be used used long-term. Long term effects in children may be different due to the fact 
that organs are still in a developmental state. 
Adverse events 
The proportions of subjects who experienced AEs were slightly higher in the liraglutide group versus 
the placebo group (88.8% versus 84.9%, respectively) with a higher rate of AEs in the liraglutide 
group (6187.8 versus 5018.5 events per 1000 PYE). The difference of all adverse events in the 
liraglutide and placebo groups appeared primarily to be driven by the higher rates of GI AEs in the 
liraglutide group (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and dizziness). 
TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of the trial product, during the ‘on-treatment’ period, were 
reported in 13 subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group versus 0 subjects in the placebo group. The 
most common AEs that led to trial product discontinuation in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group were 
vomiting (6 subjects) and nausea (4 subjects).  
Serious adverse events 
In trial 4180 there was one fatal outcome during the trial in the liraglutide group caused by suicide. 
The event was considered to be unlikely related to the trial product by the applicant. The proportion of 
subjects with SAEs, as well as the event rate was higher in the placebo group than in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group during both the on-treatment (2.4% vs 4.0%) and in-trial periods (3.2% vs 7.1%).  
Gastrointestinal adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well as the AE rate, 
were higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire treatment period: 
64.8%, 2540.4 events per 100 PYE and 36.5%, 968.5 events per 100 PYE, respectively (Trial 4180). 
The incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group during 
the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups until the 
end of the entire treatment period.  
The frequency of vomiting in subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg (34.4% of subjects and 676.9 
events per 1000 PYE) was quite high. This issue has been addressed by the MAH in section 4.8 of the 
proposed SmPC with the wording “Vomiting occurred with a 2-fold higher frequency in adolescents 
compared to adults”. The MAH was requested to clarify the reasons(s) for the high frequency of the AE 
vomiting in the adolescent population and discuss the potential clinical impact of this issue. This was 
discussed and resolved with proposed changes in SmPC. 
Hypoglycaemic adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 60/72 
 
 
 
Both in the on-treatment and in-trial period, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic 
episodes (per ADA/ISPAD and Novo Nordisk classification) and the episode rates, were higher in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group than in the placebo group.  
The ADA/ISPAD classification that defines plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/l as documented hypoglycaemia 
is considered to be clinically relevant. The observation of 31 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic 
episodes in 19 subjects (15.2%) in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared to 6 such episodes in 5 
subjects (4.0%) in the placebo group is worrying and somewhat surprising when considering the 
glucose-dependent mechanisms of GLP-1. Section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC includes the wording 
regarding hypoglycaemia in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus “Symptoms of hypoglycaemic 
events were reported by 1.6 % of patients treated with Saxenda and 1.1% of patients treated with 
placebo; however, these events were not confirmed by blood glucose measurements”. 
The MAH was requested to clarify the reasons(s) for the high frequency of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia in the adolescent population, and in addition, sufficiently address this issue in the 
SmPC. The risk of hypoglycaemia was addressed and added in the SmPC section 4.4 “Special warnings 
and precautions for use”, with a warning for adolescents and in 4.8. under Description of selected 
adverse reactions. 
Other adverse events 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety 
laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones and bone metabolism), although, small 
increases in mean pancreatic enzyme levels were observed in the liraglutide group. The clinical 
significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs 
and symptoms of pancreatitis. 
A small number of subjects (14 subjects) developed anti-liraglutide antibodies at some point during 
the clinical trial. Given the low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising effect, it is unlikely 
that antibody development had an impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 1 year of 
treatment.   
There were no ‘acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group. There 
were 5 acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in 3 subjects in the placebo group during the 
in-trial period. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the results of Trial 4180 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable 
to that in obese adults and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. However, a randomised treatment period 
of 56 weeks is relatively short for a drug that potentially is for long-term use. Long term effects in 
children may be different due to the fact that organs are still in a developmental state.  
There was one fatal outcome during the trial in the liraglutide group caused by suicide. The event was 
considered to be unlikely related to the trial. 
Similar to adults, the incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group during the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the 
treatment groups. The higher liraglutide dose in comparison to Victoza seems to have little effect on 
the AE rate, except for gastrointestinal events which were more frequent. A discrepancy with the adult 
population was observed in regarding the higher frequency of vomiting. The MAH was requested to 
clarify the reason(s) for the high frequency of the AE vomiting in the adolescent population and discuss 
Assessment report

the potential clinical impact of this issue. This was discussed and resolved with proposed changes in 
SmPC. 
Hypoglycaemic events appeared to be evident in adolescents compared to adults. The MAH was 
requested to clarify the reason(s) for the high frequency of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia in 
the adolescent population, and in addition, sufficiently address this issue in the SmPC. The risk of 
hypoglycaemia was addressed and added in the SmPC section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions 
for use”, with a warning for adolescents and in 4.8. under Description of selected adverse reactions. 
The clinical significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown, but long-term 
negative effects on the pancreas may be serious, especially when liraglutide is started in paediatric 
subjects with a developing pancreas. The company discussed the pancreatic safety of liraglutide in 
children and it was considered that pancreatic safety in adolescents will be monitored in the PSURs as 
an important potential risk for which the MAH should provide comparative analysis.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paediatric or childhood obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disorder among children and 
adolescents worldwide. Paediatric obesity is associated with a number of complications, including 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), early puberty, menstrual irregularities, polycystic ovary 
syndrome, steatohepatitis, sleep apnoea, asthma, musculoskeletal disorders and psychological 
problems. Over 90% of obesity cases are idiopathic, and less than 10% of obesity cases are associated 
with genetic and hormonal causes. A number of factors contribute to paediatric obesity. Genetic factors 
have a significant impact on individual predisposition, but other factors of behaviour and environment 
can also play a vital role in paediatric obesity. 
In the past 30 years, paediatric obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents 
worldwide. It is a chronic, refractory, and relapsing disease, afflicting, approximately 158 million 
children and adolescents aged between 5−19 years. By 2025, these numbers per forecast will climb to 
206 million before surpassing 250 million in 2030. Paediatric obesity requires long-term management. 
With the dramatic rise in the number of children affected by obesity, there is an unmet need of 
effective methods for the prevention and treatment of paediatric obesity.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Three major types of treatment options are available for obesity – lifestyle intervention, 
pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is the 
first-line treatment, but most people with obesity struggle to achieve and maintain their weight loss, 
and often fail. Pharmacotherapy is an option to fill the therapeutic gap between lifestyle intervention 
and surgery. Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention in achieving 
and sustaining weight loss, improving comorbid conditions and facilitating healthier lifestyle habits. 
There is a need for efficacious, safe and tolerable medications for paediatric patients with obesity, 
especially medications that facilitate a maintained weight loss and also target the obesity-related 
comorbidities. While pharmacotherapy may not be appropriate for all paediatric patients with obesity, 
the addition of weight loss medication to lifestyle modification may result in improved weight loss. 
Currently, bariatric surgery is primarily used for the treatment of severe obesity in childhood. 
Currently, orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide 3.0 mg are the approved treatment options 
for the long-term management of obesity in the adult population in the EU as well.  
While most of these approved obesity medications have the potential to reduce weight and weight-
related comorbidities, the majority have not been adequately tested for safety and efficacy among 
paediatric population. There has been a lack of long-term experience (and data) with weight 
management drugs in the paediatric population. Finding treatments that are safe and effective for 
paediatric patients with obesity is, therefore, crucial to improving their health and well-being.

Liraglutide treatment could potentially be an important treatment option for weight management in 
paediatric patients with obesity. 
Liraglutide 3.0 mg represents a new drug class within weight management. The effects of liraglutide 
are mediated via specific activation of the GLP-1 receptor in the brain and peripheral tissues. Due to 
the combined actions on appetite regulation, glucose metabolism and cardiometabolic risk factors, 
liraglutide 3.0 mg has unique potential for weight management in adolescent population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Trial 4180 was a 56-week double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-national 
trial followed by a 26-week period off study-drug in pubertal adolescents with obesity aged 12 to less 
than 18 years. The main part of the trial consisted of a 56-week double-blind treatment period and a 
26-week follow-up period. 
The doses of liraglutide were similar to those used in adults. The majority of the subjects could be 
escalated to liraglutide 3.0mg (82.4%) and remained on this dose throughout the trial duration of 56-
weeks (92.8%), which is a higher percentage than in the adult population.   
The mean age at baseline was 14.5 years. There were more female subjects (59.4%) than male 
subjects (40.6%), with a comparable distribution in both treatment groups. The subjects were 
predominantly White (Caucasian) (87.6%). Most of the subjects were in the BMI subgroup of 
30.0−<35.0 kg/m2 (45.8%) followed by BMI subgroup of 35.0−<40.0 (27.9%) at baseline. The 
majority of male and female subjects in both the treatment groups were pubertal and had reached full 
sexual maturity (Tanner stage 5) (51.8%).   
Overall, the mean body weight was 100.8 kg and the mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m2. The mean height at 
baseline was 1.68 m, and the mean waist circumference was 105.93 cm. The mean BMI SDS at 
baseline was 3.17. Overall, the mean HbA1c was 5.3%, the fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 mmol/L, 
and overall, most subjects were normoglycaemic (74.1%).  
Of the 299 screened subjects, 251 were randomised (1:1); 125 subjects to the liraglutide group and 
126 subjects were exposed to placebo. No difference was observed in premature discontinuation rates 
between the liraglutide group and placebo. A total of 80.1% completed the 56-week visit without 
discontinuation of the trial product.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
BMI SDS 
Treatment with liraglutide led to a reduction BMI SDS from baseline to week 56 (-0.22; ETD: -0.22 [-
0.37; -0.08]). This reduction did not sustain during the 26-week follow-up period (-0.03; ETD: -0.11 [-
0.28; 0.06]). In the placebo group, BMI SDS did not change after 56-weeks and slightly increased 
during the follow-up period (0.08).  
Change in BMI and body weight 
During the treatment period liraglutide 3.0 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in BMI 
(kg/m2) (ETD: -1.58 kg/m2 [-2.47; -0.69]), body weight (ETD: -4.50 kg [-7.17; -1.84]) and waist 
circumference (ETD: -2.93 cm [-5.24; -0.63]) compared to placebo. The estimated proportion of 
subjects who achieved a reduction in BMI of ≥5% or ≥10% from baseline was greater in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group than in the placebo group (≥5%: 43.25 vs 18.73% and ≥10%: 26.08 vs 8.11% at 56-
weeks).  
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 65/72 
 
 
 
Glycaemic parameters 
Greater reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were observed with liraglutide than with 
placebo (ETD: -0.10%-points [-0.17; -0.04]) with a statistically significant difference at week 30. 
However, this effect did not remain after 56-weeks of treatment.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is not clear if and how long the benefits of liraglutide on weight-related parameters will persist after 
long term treatment which is proposed in children. In trial 4180 subjects were treated for 56 weeks 
demonstrating a modest beneficial effect on BMI SDS and other weight-related parameters in the 
liraglutide group compared to placebo. This effect did not remain after discontinuation of the liraglutide 
during the 26-week follow-up duration.  In addition, the decrease in BMI SDS of -0.22 during 
treatment with liraglutide was not paralleled by improvements in health-related outcomes. After 56 
weeks, there were no significant changes in blood pressure, serum lipids, HbA1c or quality of life.  
In general, improvement in body composition and cardiometabolic risk can be seen with BMI SDS 
reductions of ≥0.25 in obese adolescents, while greater benefits accrue from losing at least 0.5 BMI 
SDS (Ford et al. 2010).  The MAH referred to several papers that support a reduction in BMI z score of 
0.20 to 0.25 in adolescents as a suitable threshold for clinical relevance. However, this threshold is 
based on weight loss in adolescents that was achieved with lifestyle interventions.  
In trial 4180, in a subgroup analysis of treatment effects of liraglutide 3.0 mg in subjects who adhered 
to the protocol and completed the 56 weeks of treatment, a somewhat larger decrease in BMI SDS of -
0.27 was observed. The MAH, therefore, stated that adolescents with obesity who have not achieved 
enough weight loss with lifestyle modification, are motivated to be compliant with taking a 
pharmacologic agent are the best candidates for Saxenda. However, we assume that this should have 
been represented in the outcomes of the total population of the 4180 trial. It is not clear how this will 
improve the outcomes in clinical practice compared to the findings of the current study. Furthermore, 
it is proposed that the treatment effects in these obese adolescents may be larger in the long term 
than the observed BMD SDS -0.22 in 4180 trial, by considering an alternative scenario of continued 
weight gain in this population without treatment, thus adding to the risk of obesity-related 
comorbidities. However, based on the trials in adults, further weight loss cannot be expected after the 
investigated 56 weeks, but only the maintenance of weight loss that was achieved in the first 3 
months. In addition, a significant increase in BMI SDS (weight regain) was observed in the liraglutide 
3.0 mg group from the time of treatment cessation at week 56 to week 82, thereby resulting in no 
statistically significant difference in BMI SDS change from baseline between the treatment groups at 
week 82. 
The MAH provided results of a comparison between “early responders” and “early non-responders” to 
further investigate whether this could help select patients that benefit most. In the total group, the 
placebo adjusted treatment effect of liraglutide was -0.22 BMI SDS. The placebo adjusted treatment 
effects of liraglutide in early non-responders and early responders were -0.18 and -0.27, respectively 
(p=0.5). The reduction in BMI SDS in early responders is higher than that in the total population (-
0.27 vs -0.22). In the total group, the placebo adjusted treatment effect of liraglutide on body weight 
was -4.5 kg. The placebo adjusted treatment effect of liraglutide in early non-responders and early 
responders was -3.9 and -5.3 kg, respectively(p=0.6). The reduction in body weight in early 
responders is higher than that in the total population (-5.3 vs -4.5 kg). Subgroup analyses indicated 
that there were no significant subgroup interactions (age group, BMI category, ethnicity, glycaemic 
status, waist circumference, race, sex, and Tanner stage).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the results of Trial 4180 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable 
to that in obese adults. However, a randomised treatment period of 56 weeks is relatively short for a 
drug that is potentially can be used long-term. Long term effects in children may be different due to 
the fact that organs are still in a developmental state. 
Adverse events 
The proportions of subjects who experienced AEs were slightly higher in the liraglutide group versus 
the placebo group (88.8% versus 84.9%, respectively) with a higher rate of AEs in the liraglutide 
group (6187.8 versus 5018.5 events per 1000 PYE). The difference of all adverse events in the 
liraglutide and placebo groups appeared primarily to be driven by the higher rates of GI AEs in the 
liraglutide group (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and dizziness). 
TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of the trial product, during the ‘on-treatment’ period, were 
reported in 13 subjects in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group versus 0 subjects in the placebo group. The 
most common AEs that led to trial product discontinuation in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group were 
vomiting (6 subjects) and nausea (4 subjects).  
Serious adverse events 
In trial 4180 there was one fatal outcome during the trial in the liraglutide group caused by suicide. 
The event was considered to be unlikely related to the trial product. The proportion of subjects with 
SAEs, as well as the event rate was higher in the placebo group than in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group 
during both the on-treatment (2.4% vs 4.0%) and in-trial periods (3.2% vs 7.1%).  
Gastrointestinal adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with AEs within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, as well as the AE rate, 
were higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group during the entire treatment period: 
64.8%, 2540.4 events per 100 PYE and 36.5%, 968.5 events per 100 PYE, respectively (Trial 4180). 
The incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group during 
the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the treatment groups until the 
end of the entire treatment period.  
Hypoglycaemic adverse events 
More treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg groups 
compared to the placebo groups in the both trials. In trial 4180, 31 documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemic episodes in 19 subjects (15.2%) was reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared 
to 6 such episodes in 5 subjects (4.0%) in the placebo group, which is considered to be much higher 
compared to the reported frequencies in previous clinical trials with liraglutide 3.0 mg in adults. Using 
the criteria by International Hypoglycaemia Study Group (IHSG) 2017/ADA2018/ISPAD2018 for 
clinically significant hypoglycaemia (i.e. plasma glucose confirmed <3.0 mmol/L), the percentage of 
patients reporting at least one episode of clinically significant hypoglycaemia were higher with 
liraglutide (1.6%) compared to placebo (0.8%). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the 
trial.  
Other adverse events 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline or differences between groups in safety 
laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistry, hormones and bone metabolism), although, small 
increases in mean pancreatic enzyme levels were observed in the liraglutide group. The clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 67/72 
 
 
 
significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown in the absence of other signs 
and symptoms of pancreatitis. 
A small number of subjects (14 subjects) developed anti-liraglutide antibodies at some point during 
the clinical trial. Given the low antibody levels and the lack of in vitro neutralising effect, it is unlikely 
that antibody development had an impact on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide during 1 year of 
treatment.   
There were no ‘acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group. There 
were 5 acute gallstone disease’ related AEs reported in 3 subjects in the placebo group during the 
in-trial period. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In general, the results of Trial 4180 have demonstrated that liraglutide has a safety profile comparable 
to that in obese adults and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. However, a randomised treatment period 
of 56 weeks is relatively short for a drug that may be used long-term. Long term effects in children 
may be different due to the fact that organs are still in a developmental state.  
Similar to adults, the incidence of all GI AEs was mainly higher in the liraglutide group than in the 
placebo group during the initial 8 weeks of treatment and then remained comparable between the 
treatment groups. The higher liraglutide dose in comparison to Victoza seems to have little effect on 
the AE rate, except for gastrointestinal events which were more frequent.  
The observation of 31 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes in 19 subjects (15.2%) in the 
liraglutide 3.0 mg group compared to 6 such episodes in 5 subjects (4.0%) in the placebo group is 
surprising when considering the glucose-dependent mechanisms of GLP-1. The proportion of adult 
subjects reporting AEs of hypoglycaemia was low, both with liraglutide 3.0 mg (1.6% of subjects) and 
placebo (1.1% of subjects).  
The clinical significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations with liraglutide is unknown, but long-term 
negative effects on the pancreas are uncertain if can be serious, especially when liraglutide is started 
in paediatric subjects with a developing pancreas. The company discussed the pancreatic safety of 
liraglutide in children and it was considered that pancreatic safety in adolescents will be monitored in 
the PSURs as an important potential risk for which the MAH should provide comparative analysis.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant proposed an extension of the indication of liraglutide for use in adolescents (aged 12 
years to less than 18 years) with obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m² for adults by international 
cut-off points). The subjects’ mean age at baseline was 14.5 years, and mean BMI was 35.6kg/m2, 
suggesting that most of the subjects had severe obesity. Mean Hba1c was 5.3% with most subjects in 
the normoglycaemic range (74.1%). Obesity in adolescents is currently a global problem with three 
major types of treatment options available: lifestyle intervention, pharmacotherapy and bariatric 
surgery. However, lifestyle interventions often fail in the long term, and bariatric surgery is only 
indicated for severe obesity in childhood. With regard to pharmacotherapy, none of the approved 
treatment options for the long-term management of obesity in the adult populations is approved in 
adolescents in the EU as they have not been adequately tested for safety and efficacy in the adolescent 
population. So, there is an unmet medical need for adolescent subjects with obesity who fail lifestyle 
interventions.  
In these adolescent subjects (n = 251), 56 weeks of treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of 
liraglutide (82.4% could be escalated to 3.0mg), was associated with a statistically significant decrease 
in BMI SDS (ETD of -0.22 [-0.37; - 0.08] 95% CI, p=0.0022) compared to placebo. Bodyweight was 
statistically significantly reduced -2.26kg in the liraglutide group compared to +2.25kg in the placebo 
group (ETD of -4.50 kg [-7.17; -1.84] 95% CI, p= 0.0009) as well as BMI (kg/m2) (ETD: -1.58 kg/m2 
[-2.47; -0.69] 95% CI, p=0.0005), and waist circumference (ETD: -2.93 cm [-5.24; -0.63] 95% CI, 
p=0.0126). After treatment discontinuation and deblinding the treatment effect of liraglutide did not 
sustain.  
Although the responder analyses showed that a larger percentage of adolescents achieved weight loss 
>10% with liraglutide compared to placebo (26 vs 8%), there remain uncertainties with regards to the 
clinical relevance of the reduction observed in BMI SDS in the total adolescent obese population. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/217044/2021  
Page 69/72 
 
 
 
 
contrast to the lifestyle-based weight loss in adolescents and liraglutide-induced weight loss in adults, 
there are no data available with regards to improvements in health-related outcomes with liraglutide in 
adolescents. This is important, especially because the treatment can be long-term. Based on the trials 
in adults, a further weight loss after the investigated 56 weeks is not expected, but only the 
maintenance of the weight loss that was achieved in the first months. In addition, the adherence in 
adolescents may become less in the following years, as was also observed in trial 4180 after 42 weeks. 
This could further decrease the treatment effect. 
Given the uncertainties regarding the clinical relevance of the overall achieved reduction in BMI/body 
weight in the total population, introducing a stopping rule in the context of goal-driven weight 
management should help in the selection of adolescent patients that benefit most and may protect 
patients from unnecessary long-term treatment. A similar stopping rule as included for Saxenda in 
adults, has been included for adolescents. In addition, a stopping rule is in line with the Endocrine 
Society Guidelines (Styne et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2017), i.e. the percentage (4%) is 
slightly lower than for adults, taking in account the growth of adolescents and the change in weight-
related to that. The effects of Saxenda on weight-related endpoints were higher in "early responders" 
compared to "early non-responders" when adjusted for placebo.  As requested, subgroup analyses 
were performed for different parameters at baseline (age group, BMI category, ethnicity, glycaemic 
status, waist circumference, race, sex, and Tanner stage). The results indicate that there were no 
significant subgroup interactions.  
There was an increased risk of both asymptomatic and documented hypoglycaemia episodes with 
liraglutide. In contrast to adults, the proportion of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes was 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. As requested, the risk of hypoglycaemia is 
added to the SmPC section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions”. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although the efficacy is considered modest, demonstrated effects, in combination with the stopping 
rule, unmet medical need and safety profile which seemed similar to the one observed in adults, the 
benefit risk is considered to be positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R balance for Saxenda is considered to be positive in the following proposed extension of 
the indication: 
“Saxenda  can  be  used  as  an  adjunct  to  a  healthy  nutrition  and  increased  physical  activity  for  weight 
management in adolescent patients from the age of 12 years and above with: 
• 
• 
obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m2 for adults by international cut-off points)* and 
body weight above 60 kg.  
Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued and re-evaluated if patients have not lost at least 4% 
of their BMI or BMI z score after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose.´

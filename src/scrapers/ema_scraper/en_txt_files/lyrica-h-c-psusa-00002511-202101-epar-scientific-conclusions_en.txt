Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pregabalin, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on drug-induced parkinsonism from spontaneous reports including literature 
case reports and in view of availability of a possible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between pregabalin and Parkinsonism is established and concluded that the product 
information of products containing pregabalin should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pregabalin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pregabalin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

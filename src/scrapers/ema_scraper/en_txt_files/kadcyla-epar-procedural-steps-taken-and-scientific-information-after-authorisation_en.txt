are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who 
have invasive residual disease, in the breast and/or

4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC 
are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce editorial changes

C.1.4: Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
order to update the safety information on the risk of 
Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) based on the final 
results from study BO39807 listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP. This is an observational study of 
cardiac events in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer who have a Left Ventricular 
Ejection Fraction (LVEF) between 40%-49% prior to 
initiating treatment with Kadcyla; the RMP version 
(7 out of 32) of MBC patients initiating trastuzumab 
emtansine with LVEF of 40-49% at baseline, experienced a 
LVEF drop of >10% from baseline and/or CHF; most of 
these patients had other cardiovascular risk factors. The 
decision to administer trastuzumab emtansine in MBC 
patients with low LVEF must be made only after careful 
benefit risk assessment and cardiac function should be 
closely monitored in these patients.

with or without pertuzumab. No new safety signals were 
identified with longer follow-up time and the safety profile 
of trastuzumab emtansine was consistent with previously 
reported findings. Overall these results did not warrant 
changes to the approved product information.

treatment. Some of these bleeding events resulted in fatal 
outcomes. The incidence of severe haemorrhagic events 
(Grade ≥3) occurred in 2.2% of the overall trastuzumab 
emtansine treated patients in clinical studies. In some of 
the observed cases the patients had thrombocytopenia, or 
were also receiving anti-coagulant therapy or antiplatelet 
therapy; in others there were no known additional risk 
factors. Use caution with these agents and consider 
additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically

results of this study demonstrated that the safety profile of 
Kadcyla is consistent with that reported previously, and no 
new safety signals have been identified. By submitting this 
study report, the Marketing Authorisation Holder fulfilled a 
condition to the marketing authorisation and therefore

SmPC and 
Annex II 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with long-term 
Overall survival (OS) data from the pivotal study 
EMILIA (TDM4370g/BO21977). The Annex II of the 
product information is updated accordingly to delete 
the relevant condition (ANX006). Furthermore, 
section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated as a result of a 
pooled data analysis from several clinical studies 
including a change in the frequency of dizziness from 
very common to common. The RMP is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the RMP is updated with the 
inclusion and deletion of safety concerns 
(introduction of enhanced pregnancy program, 
inclusion of evaluation of cardiac safety in patients 
with baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction below 
50% and deletion of a category 3 study evaluating 
efficacy of monotherapy versus trastuzumab in 
combination with docetaxel). Changes of final CSR 
due dates for study KRISTINE (BO28408) and 
KAMILLA (mo28231) have been introduced. The MAH 
also took the opportunity to update the RMP 
following requests from previously assessed 
procedures (EMEA/H/C/002389/MEA/011.1 and 
EMEA/H/C/002389/ANX/007). In addition, the MAH 
has taken the occasion to include in the RMP some 
other minor corrections.

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH has submitted the variation application in order to

update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with regards to the 
The MAh submitted a grouped variation application 
as follows: 
- Type II variation to update section 4.6 of the SmPC 
and section 2 of the Package Leaflet in order to 
change the duration of contraception to be used after 
concluding Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) 
treatment, and the period before starting breast 
feeding, from 6 to 7 months in line with the 
Herceptin (trastuzumab) product information. 
Further, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
timelines for use of contraception and for start of breast 
feeding after concluding treatment with Kadcyla. In 
addition, updates to the RMP have been proposed, as a 
consequence of the update to the SmPC but also in order to 
amend the due dates for three studies included in the RMP. 
The due date for one of these studies is reflected in Annex 
II and hence Annex II has been updated in accordance with 
the changes to the RMP. The changes to the product 
information and RMP are acceptable.  
This variation application does not influence the benefit /

authorised indication(s). 
minor editorial changes in the Package Leaflet. 
- Type IB variation to update the due dates 
concerning the submission of the overall survival 
outcome data from the pivotal study BO21977 
(EMILIA) in Annex II of the product information and 
the RMP. 
- Type IB variation to update the due date in the 
RMP concerning the submission of data from the 
study BO25499.

RMP concerning the submission of data for the study 
BO28407 (KAITLIN).

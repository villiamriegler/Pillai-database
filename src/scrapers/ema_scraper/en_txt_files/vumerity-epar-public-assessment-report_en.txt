2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous 
system  (CNS)  characterised  by  inflammation,  demyelination,  neuronal  and  oligodendrocyte  loss,  and 
disruption  of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  leading  to  irreversible  deficits  in  physical  function  and  cognition 
and an impaired quality of life. Typically, MS starts in the second or third decade of life.  
Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 85% of 
patients  at  diagnosis,  and  it  is  characterised  by  alternating  exacerbations  of  neurological  dysfunction 
followed by  periods of remission with partial or total recovery and clinical  stability, which can last for 
months or years (EMA MS guideline, EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). 
With  the  present  application,  the  applicant  seeks  approval  of  diroximel  fumarate  for  the  treatment  of 
adult patients with RRMS. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Worldwide, the number of people with MS is estimated at 2.8 million. In 2020, the global incidence was 
estimated at 2.1 individuals per 100 000 and the global prevalence was estimated at 36 individuals per 
100 000, with women being at a 2-times (in some countries at a 4-times) higher likelihood to develop 
MS than men1. Regionally, the median prevalence of MS in 2020 was greatest in Europe (143 per 100 
000), followed by the Americas (117 per 100 000), and the Eastern Mediterranean (33 per 100 000). 
Prevalence of MS in Africa, South East Asia and Western Pacific was less than 10 per 100 000. Overall, 
the incidence of MS appears to increase over the years.

Multiple Sclerosis Journal. 2020;26(14):1816-1821. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact aetiology of MS remains unknown, it is generally assumed that MS is mediated by an 
immune-mediated inflammatory process that is triggered by environmental factors and superimposed 
on a genetic predisposition. The major contributors to this process are macrophages and microglia from 
the  innate  immune  system,  and  T  and  B  lymphocytes  from  the  adaptive  immune  system.  From  the 
peripheral immune system, autoreactive T-helper cells are primed and stimulated to infiltrate the CNS 
where they target myelin antigens. Inflammation of the white and grey matter tissues in the CNS due to 
focal immune cell infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS not 
only to the myelin sheath but also to the underlying axons. This process happens over time and results 
in repeated  attacks. Demyelination and axonal damage impair or interrupt nerve transmission, giving 
rise to clinical signs and symptoms. B and T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells are 
all involved in any stage of MS. Neuropathology studies have found that the patterns of inflammation 
are very similar between relapsing and progressive MS.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Symptoms  of  RRMS  can  include  numbness  and  weakness  in  the  legs  leading  to  difficulty  in  walking, 
vision loss, incoordination, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and pain. These lesion-driven symptoms are 
also associated with considerable anxiety and distress for patients. Relapses may result in incomplete 
recovery of function and leave permanent disability and impairment that accumulates over time2,3. 
The diagnosis of RRMS can be based on clinical considerations alone, but magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), cerebrospinal fluid, and/or electrophysiological findings can support, supplement, or even replace 
some of the clinical diagnostic criteria for MS. Given the complexities of diagnosing MS, the McDonald 
diagnostic  criteria  have  been  developed  and  continue  to  be  revised  to  facilitate  earlier  diagnosis  and 
initiation  of  treatment.  The  McDonald  diagnostic  criteria  comprise  clinical  observation,  neurologic 
examination, brain and spinal cord MRI scans, visual/auditory evoked potentials, and cerebrospinal fluid 
examination4. These criteria have been used for nearly 2 decades and have recently been updated in 
20174-7.

2.1.5.  Management 
In  addition  to  medicines  approved  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  MS  (e.g.,  aminopyridine  for 
improvement of walking ability) and for the treatment of relapses (such as corticosteroids), there are 
currently more than ten disease modifying treatments (DMTs) approved for use in patients with RRMS 
and/ or other forms of relapsing MS (RMS) in the EU. In a clinical setting, early treatment of RMS usually 
starts  with  a  substance  from  the  interferon-beta  class  (IFN-β),  glatiramer  acetate  (GA),  dimethyl 
fumarate  [DMF],  or  teriflunomide.  These  medicines  are  characterised  by  moderate  clinical  efficacy 
(relative relapse reduction compared to placebo in the 30to 50% range) and are therefore typically used 
in patients without high disease activity.  
A higher relative relapse reduction was found to be achieved by the S1P receptor modulator fingolimod, 
which is therefore approved for highly active RRMS only owing to its safety profile. Safety concerns with 
fingolimod include cardiac effects at treatment initiation, serious and opportunistic infections, progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cutaneous malignancies, lymphoma, macular oedema, posterior 
reversible  encephalopathy,  respiratory effects,  increased  liver  enzymes,  and  the  risk  of  rebound  after 
stopping  the  treatment.  Three  drugs  from  the  class  of  S1P  receptor  modulators  have  recently  been 
approved, i.e., siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod. Siponimod is indicated for the treatment of adults 
with  secondary  progressive  MS  with  active  disease  evidenced  by  relapses  or  imaging  features  of 
inflammatory activity. Ozanimod is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with RRMS with active 
disease  as  defined  by  clinical  or  imaging  features.  Ponesimod  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. 
The monoclonal DMTs anti CD-20, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab, are indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Other DMTs including the 
monoclonal  antibodies  alemtuzumab  and  natalizumab,  as  well  as  cladribine,  a  nucleoside  analogue  of

deoxyadenosine,  are  restricted  to  patients  with  highly  active  disease  due  to  less  favourable  safety 
profiles. Daclizumab was withdrawn from the market in 2018 due to serious safety concerns (cases of 
serious inflammatory brain disorders). The chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone is reserved for patients 
with high active MS without alternative treatment options. 
2.2.  About the product 
Diroximel fumarate (DRF, also named Vumerity, BIIB098, ALKS 8700, and RDC-5108 in the dossier) is 
a fumarate ester that has been developed for the oral treatment of RRMS. DRF undergoes rapid pre-
systemic esterase cleavage to produce the major active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF). MMF 
is  the  active  moiety  of  DMF  (also  termed  BG00012)  contained  in  the  centrally  authorised  medicinal 
product Tecfidera (EMEA/H/C/2601). The applicant holds the Marketing Authorisation of Tecfidera, which 
is also indicated for the treatment of RRMS in adults. 
In  addition  to  MMF,  the  major  inactive  metabolite  2-hydroxyethyl  succinimide  (referred  to  as  HES  or 
RDC-6567) and the minor metabolite RDC-8439 (less than 1% of total DRF related systemic exposure 
in humans) are formed from DRF. 
The  mechanism  by  which  DRF  and  DMF  exert  therapeutic  effects  in  MS  is  not  fully  understood. 
Non-clinical studies indicate that DMF and DRF pharmacodynamic (PD) responses appear to be mediated, 
at least in part, through stimulation of nuclear factor (erythroid 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional 
activity  in  the  response  to  oxidative  stress.  DMF  has  been  shown  to  up  regulate  Nrf2-dependent 
antioxidant genes in patients (e.g. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1; [NQO1]). 
The claimed indication is “treatment of adult patients with RRMS”.  
DRF has been formulated as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) hard capsules of a 231 mg strength. 
Accordingly, each minitablet contains 7 mg of DRF. Clinical therapy is proposed to be initiated with an 
oral dose of 231 mg twice a day (BID; bis in die) under supervision of a physician. After seven days, this 
dose should be increased to the oral maintenance treatment of 462 mg BID. An oral dose of 462 mg DRF 
and 240 mg DMF was found to produce bioequivalent exposure to MMF after administration in adults. 
Thus, it is expected that clinical efficacy and safety of both drug products are similar with equipotent 
dosing, i.e. 462 mg DRF twice daily equals 240 mg DMF twice daily. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
DRF  has  been  characterised  in  an  extensive  clinical  pharmacology  programme  including  ten  Phase  1 
studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  special  populations.  Seven  Phase  1  studies  with  DRF  assessed  the 
pharmacokinetics  (PK),  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  elimination  (ADME),  drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs), effects on cardiac repolarisation, and PK in participants with renal impairment. Three 
phase 1 studies aimed to establish relative bioavailability of MMF between DRF and DMF under fasted 
and fed conditions as well as with varying conditions of fat and caloric content. 
The clinical development programme in MS patients consists of two Phase 3 studies, one of which being 
an active-controlled study and the other being open-label (OL). 
One completed double-blind study aimed to evaluate the comparative gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability 
of  DRF  and  DMF  (Study  A302  [EVOLVE-MS2]),  and  the  ongoing  OL  safety  study  of  DRF  (Study  A301 
[EVOLVE-MS1]) examines longer treatment with DRF in rollovers from A302 and de novo patients.  
Since  no  pivotal  trial  has  been  conducted  with  DRF,  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  basically  rely  on  four 
pivotal DMF studies already submitted and assessed in EMEA/H/C/002601 (i.e., Phase 2 Study C-1900,

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Diroximel fumarate is produced by one manufacturer. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  diroximel  fumarate  consists  of  three  chemical  transformation  steps, 
recrystallisation steps and a milling step.  
Possible organic impurities arising from the manufacturing process of the active substance have been 
adequately identified/characterised. The impurities were also evaluated for potential mutagenicity using 
both rule-based and statistical-based tools.  
Concerning elemental impurities, analytical test results of six batches of diroximel fumarate by ICP-MS 
demonstrate absence (<LoQ) of elemental impurities in the active substance.  
Information on the possible formation of organic impurities, including impurities originating from starting 
materials, has been provided. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Solvent used for the manufacturing process and is controlled in accordance with criteria described in the 
ICH Q3C(R6) guideline. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials, and reagents have been presented. 
Critical  process  parameters  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  identified  and  adequate  controls 
established. The specifications for the isolated intermediates implemented are adequate. 
The development of the manufacturing process of diroximel fumarate has been adequately described. 
The development focused on optimising reagents, raw materials, processing conditions, and operational 
efficiency to accomplish the chemical transformations and purifications without making changes to the 
synthetic route. Proven acceptable ranges for the critical process parameters (e.g., hold temperature in 
step  1  and  step  2)  were  established  and  have  been  justified.  No  design  space  is  proposed.  Changes 
introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The active substance is stored in double food-grade, antistatic, low-density polyethylene sealed bags. 
The sealed bags are placed into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drums with snap lids that are equipped 
with tamper evident seals. The packaging material is in compliance with EU Directives 2011/10/EC and 
amendments and Ph. Eur. 3.1.4.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, FTIR), 
assay (HPLC), related impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition (sulfated ash, Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(HS-GS), and particle size (Laser diffraction).

Impurities  are  categorised  as  specified  impurities  with  individual  acceptance  criteria  and  unspecified 
impurities.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  from  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed  manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% 
RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, water content, assay, and related impurities. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The results under both long-term and accelerated conditions showed little change and variability for all 
test parameters. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify 
the proposed retest period.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a white gastro-resistant hard capsule, size 0 (approximately 18 mm 
in length), printed with ‘DRF 231 mg’ in black ink. Each capsule enteric-coated minitablets designed to 
provide a delayed release (DR) profile. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline solid, slightly soluble in aqueous solutions across 
the pH range 2 to 9. Diroximel fumarate Form I is the only form observed during release and stability of 
representative active substance batches at all scales. The isolated active substance is milled to meet a 
particle size distribution range. The specification for particle size distribution is provided and justified. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no  novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The HMPC capsule 
shell,  although  not  compendial,  contains  ingredients  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur  standards.  The  list  of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Excipient compatibility studies and physicochemical properties of the active substance were evaluated in 
order to prioritise the selection of excipients during formulation development. A number of excipients for 
each function in the formulation were assessed and the final excipients selected. 
An  assessment  of  compatibility  of  diroximel  fumarate  with  each  excipient  in  the  finished  product  was 
performed. It was concluded that the excipients selected for use in the finished product formulation are 
compatible with diroximel fumarate. 
Development of diroximel fumarate capsules progressed following the establishment of a quality target 
product profile (QTPP).

The composition was developed to meet quality attributes (QAs) established for each stage to ensure 
the product performed as intended. Quality attributes that impacted the quality, safety or efficacy of 
the finished product were deemed critical quality attributes (CQAs). There were 3 stages of formulation 
development: 
Stage 1: development of the minitablet composition 
Stage 2: development of the coating system 
Stage 3: selection of the capsule shell. 
Influence of the particle size distribution of the active substance on the quality of the finished product 
has been thoroughly investigated.  
The  objective  for  the  manufacturing  process  development  was  to  ensure  that  a  robust,  repeatable 
process  was  established  to  ensure  the  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  of  the  finished  product  were 
consistently met.The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with a polypropylene closure and a silica gel 
desiccant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in one manufacturing site 
The manufacturing process consists of blending, tableting, coating and encapsulation steps. Validation 
of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  follows  a  3-stage  life  cycle  approach,  which  includes 
process  design,  process  performance  validation  (which  is  otherwise  known  as  process  performance 
qualification (PPQ) and continued (ongoing) process verification. This ensures that product and process 
understanding, from development through the production of commercial batches, are incorporated as 
part  of  validation.  The  overall  purpose  of  the  validation  programme  is  to  provide  a  high  degree  of 
assurance  that  the  product,  when  manufactured  in  accordance  with  pre-defined  procedures  will 
consistently comply with quality requirements. 
All steps in the finished product manufacturing process were successfully validated for finished product 
batches.  All  process  validation  batches  met  the  release  specification.  The  process  validation  results 
demonstrate  that  each  unit  operation  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  in  a  state  of  control  and 
demonstrates  the  manufacturing  process  consistently  provides  a  finished  product  that  meets  its  pre-
defined acceptance criteria and product quality attributes 
The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications  includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description (visual), identification (HPLC-UV, Raman spectroscopy), assay (HPLC-UV),  impurities 
(HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water determination (Ph. Eur.), 
and residual solvent (HS-GC), and microbial limit tests (Ph. Eur.).  
The  finished  product  has  been  routinely  monitored  for  impurities.  Process  impurities  in  the  active 
substance are controlled by the active substance specifications. Potentially mutagenic impurities have 
been assessed and none have been identified.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 7 batches 
using a validated ICP-MS  method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity control.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted  that  no  risk  was  identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control  measures  are  deemed 
necessaryThe analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, base phase dissolution and acid 
phase dissolution. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
There is no change in stability over time at long term storage for these quality attributes. 
In  accordance  with  the  ICH  Guideline  Q1A  (R2),  stress  studies  were  performed  for  the  purpose  of 
identifying the likely degradation products and demonstrating that the methods are stability indicating.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results detailed showed that the DRF capsule finished product 
is not photo labile. 
An in-use stability study was conducted in one batch.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of two years and store below 25°C, store in the 
original bottle in order to protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During  the  assessment,  information  was  requested  as  major  objections.  The  applicant  provided 
responses and all these issues were considered resolved. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
DRF is rapidly cleaved by esterases after oral ingestion thereby generating predominantly the metabolites 
MMF  and  HES,  or  to  a  minor  extent,  RDC  8439  and  methanol.  The  major  metabolite  MMF  is 
pharmacologically active and known to mediate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity 
of  DMF,  a  dimethyl  ester  of  fumaric  acid  authorised  for  RRMS  therapy  since  2014  (EMEA/H/C/2601; 
“Tecfidera”). In contrast, HES was confirmed to be pharmacologically inactive, but its levels exceeded 
those  of  MMF  after  administration  of  the  maximally  recommended  human  DRF  maintenance  dose  of 
462 mg  BID  (maximum  recommended  human  dose  [MRHD];  ~6.2-fold  higher  maximum  observed 
concentration [Cmax] and 21.3-fold higher Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 
zero  to  time  of  last  measurable  concentration  [AUClast]  of  HES  than  MMF).  The  pharmacological 
characteristics of the main metabolites MMF and HES were therefore non-clinically elucidated in relation 
to the parent compound DRF and also in comparison to DMF. 
It has been earlier demonstrated during marketing authorisation application (MAA) of DMF in primary 
rat  and  human  astrocytes,  oligodendrocytes  and  hippocampal  neurons  as  well  as  in  experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models in rats that MMF releases the ubiquitous transcription factor 
Nrf2  from  constitutive  repression  by  “Kelch-like  erythroid  cell-derived  protein  with  CNC  homology-
associated  protein  1”  (Keap  1).  As  a  consequence,  Nrf2  translocates  into  the  nucleus  to  induce  the 
expression  of  anti-inflammatory,  antioxidant  and  stress-related  genes  like  NADPH  dehydrogenase 
(NQO1),  aldo-keto  reductase  family  1  member  B8  (Akr1b8),  haem  oxygenase  1  (HO1)  and  oxidative 
stress induced growth inhibitor 1 (Osgin1). Accordingly, equimolar oral doses of 192.5 mg/kg DRF and 
100 mg/kg DMF effectively induced the Nrf2-dependent expression of Akr1b8, HO1 and Osgin1 within 
two or six hours post administration in mice with quantitative differences in brain, spleen, jejunum and 
kidney, which correlated with MMF levels in these tissues.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary PD in vivo activity of DRF was also investigated in comparison to MMF and DMF in the well-
established EAE model of human MS in rats. The daily oral doses of 354 mg/kg DRF, 181 mg/kg MMF 
and 200 mg/kg DMF were administered from the day of EAE induction for 22 days and were selected to 
achieve comparable MMF exposure. Although the analysis of MMF plasma exposure in a subset of animals 
pointed towards approximately two-fold higher levels in the MMF group than in DRF- and DMF-treated 
animals,  the  development  and  severity  of  EAE  disease  symptoms  (median  day  of  EAE  onset,  mean 
maximum EAE score and mean EAE severity) were comparably delayed between DRF-, MMF- or DMF-
treated animals. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In secondary PD interaction studies, DRF and HES concentrations of 10 and 300 µM each did not unveil 
any relevant binding to a panel of 135 receptors, transporters and enzymes. A subsequent screen aimed 
to  elucidate  the  effect  of  450 µM  MMF,  HES  and  the  MMF/HES  combination  on  148 biomarkers  in 
12 primary  human  cell  cultures  systems.  MMF  revealed  the  anticipated  induction  of  inflammatory, 
immunomodulatory and tissue remodelling biomarkers and concomitantly inhibited the proliferation of B 
cells,  coronary  artery  smooth  muscle  cells  and  fibroblasts.  Moreover,  MMF  was  cytotoxic  to  vascular 
endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, HES was pharmacologically inactive 
in these cell cultures and did not alter the MMF activity as evident by the biomarker activation profile of 
the MMF/HES combination that was highly congruent with MMF incubation alone. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The  safety  pharmacology  of  DRF  was  investigated  in  good  laboratory  practice  (GLP)  compliant  core 
battery  of  studies  in  accordance  with  ICH  S7A  and  S7B  recommendations  (CPMP/ICH/539/00  and 
CPMP/ICH/423/02).  Cardiovascular  endpoints  were  also  evaluated  in  general  repeat-dose  toxicology 
studies in monkeys. 
Up  to  300 µM  of  either  DRF  or  HES  and  even  higher  concentrations  of  up  to  1500 µM  MMF  did  not 
interfere  with  human  ether-à-go-go  related  gene  (hERG)  currents  in vitro.  In  conscious  telemetered 
monkeys, oral 400 mg/kg DRF doses induced minor QTc prolongations (3 to 6 %), which did not correlate 
with  the  time  of  maximum  concentration  (tmax)  of  MMF  or  the  minor  metabolite  RDC-8439  (~45 min 
each). 
In rats, oral DRF doses up to 600 mg/kg did not impair respiratory function in a plethysmography study 
and did not affect CNS function in a fibreoptic bronchoscopy. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  PD  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  DRF,  which  is  acceptable  given  the  established 
primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamic  as  well  as  safety  pharmacological  effects  of  its  active 
metabolite MMF and the available clinical experience with DMF in RRMS therapy, which was adequately 
considered for Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report

Page 18/148 
 
 
 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of DRF were determined in different cell types in vitro and after single and repeated 
once daily oral administration in rats and monkeys in vivo using validated liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometry. With regard to the previously licensed DMF (“Tecfidera”), DRF was similarly 
expected to be pre-systemically hydrolysed by esterases. The unspecific cleavage of the two ester bonds 
does not involve the main hepatic enzymes and is not subject to gender or species differences. 
As  in  humans,  the  rapid  metabolic  conversion  of  DRF  generally  precluded  its  identification  in  animal 
plasma.  Instead,  drug  exposure  had  to  be  monitored  by  means  of  the  two  major  human  metabolites 
MMF  and  HES  that  were  also  confirmed  as  main  metabolites  following  repeated  once  daily  oral 
administrations in rats and monkeys. In addition, the minor metabolite RDC-8439 (<1 % of drug related 
exposure in humans) was formed in minimal amounts in both species. 
Cmax  of  MMF  and  RDC-8439  were  determined  after  15 min  in  rats  and  after  45 minutes  in  monkeys, 
whereas the Cmax of HES was evident between 45 min and 2 h. The exposure of MMF and HES increased 
dose-dependently in rats and even dose-proportionally in monkeys. Following five days of dosing, MMF 
and  HES  exposure  had  decreased  in  rats,  but  remained  nearly  constant  in  monkeys.  As  RDC-8439 
concentrations were generally low in both species, the dose/exposure relationship is only implicated by 
its Cmax, but could not be established for AUC. 
Overall,  none  of  the  three  metabolites  accumulated  in  animals.  The  AUC-based  exposure  of  HES  in 
plasma exceeded that of MMF by 18.3- to 39.6-fold in rats and 7.2- to 16.9-fold in monkeys. 
In accordance with data obtained during authorisation of DMF, MMF demonstrated low binding to plasma 
proteins in all species (≤27 %), which was even lower for HES and RDC-8439. 
The tissue distribution was analysed after single oral administration of DRF by Quantitative Whole Body 
Autoradiography in pigmented rats using two radioactive variants that contained the  14C-labels either 
inside  the  succinimide  of  the  HES  entity,  or  in  the  MMF  moiety.  Both  substances  were  predominantly 
detected in the wall of urinary bladder and gastrointestinal tract as well as in kidney, aorta, liver and 
blood. However, more extensive distribution could be traced for the DRF substance with the radioactively 
labelled MMF moiety leading to substantial levels in brain, spinal cord, uveal tract, eye, lens, pigmented 
and non-pigmented skin, adrenal, pituitary and thyroid gland, fat, lymph node, spleen, thymus, heart, 
muscle, bone, Harderian, lachrymal and salivary glands. Except thymus and prostate, radioactivity within 
these  tissues  was  detectable  until  study  termination  at  675  hours  post  dosing.  In  contrast,  the  DRF 
compound with the label inside the succinimide moiety subsided faster and was no longer measurable 
beyond the 168-hour time point. This finding corroborates that the HES metabolite does not accumulate. 
DRF substance containing the radioactively labelled MMF moiety also distributed into pigmented ocular, 
cutaneous and adrenal tissues. 
In the mass balance study in rats, MMF could only be determined at 0.5 hours after oral administration 
in plasma, but not later. Concomitantly, glucose was confirmed in plasma until 4 hours post dosing, while 
HES  was  quantifiable  up  to  the  8-hour  time  point.  Other  metabolites  including  RDC  8439  were  below 
detection limits. In concert with earlier findings of DMF, these results indicate the conversion of MMF into 
fumaric acid, which enters the highly conserved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle resulting in the formation 
of  glucose,  water  and  carbon  dioxide.  Accordingly,  a  substantial  amount  of  radioactively  labelled  DRF 
was eliminated by expired air (35.91 %). In addition, MMF and HES were found to be excreted via urine 
(75.75 %),  while  minimal  amounts  were  cleared  by  faeces.  Compared  to  MMF,  HES  represented  the 
major urinary metabolite in rats (75.16 % vs. 12.33 %).

In PK drug interaction studies in vitro, DRF and its metabolites MMF, HES and RDC-8439 did not reveal 
clinically  relevant  interactions  with  the  main  Cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes  and  uptake  or  efflux 
transporters. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Instead  of  single  dose  toxicity  evaluations,  dose  escalations  in  monkeys  and  short-term  dose-range 
findings in rats and monkeys to establish the MTD for subsequent toxicity studies were performed, which 
is  endorsed  given  available  data  from  the  previously  licensed  DMF,  the  generally  limited  relevance  of 
single dose toxicity investigations and prevailing European 3R principles (see EPAR of “Tecfidera” and 
EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995; EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010; EMA/CHMP/CVMP/JEG-3Rs/450091/2012). 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The  toxicity  of  DRF  and  its  major  metabolites  MMF  and  HES  was  investigated  after  repeated  oral 
administrations for up to 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in Cynomolgus monkeys, which were followed 
by  recovery  periods  of  14  or  28 days  to  monitor  the  reversibility  of  effects.  DRF  was  generally 
administered as oral gavage solution consisting of citrate buffered 0.5 % HPMC (Methocel E50 Premium 
LV™)  and  0.2 %  polysorbate 20,  pH 4  ±  0.1,  which  differs  from  the  clinical  delayed-release  gastro-
resistant minitablet formulation in hard capsules that is intended for marketing. 
Mortality or moribundity that could be attributed to DRF was limited to three male rats administered the 
450 mg/kg/day  high  dose  in  the  91 days  subchronic  toxicity  study  with  cardiac  and  adventitial 
inflammation as well as myocardial necrosis. All other fatalities in DRF-treated animals could be either 
ascribed to spontaneous tumours, inappropriate gavage administrations, or to erroneous blood sampling. 
Across  toxicity  studies,  the  kidney  was  identified  as  toxicity  target  in  rats  and  monkeys.  The  higher 
kidney  weights  correlated  with  proteinuria  and  corresponded  histologically  to  adverse  kidney  tubular 
degeneration/necrosis,  cortical  tubular  hypertrophy  and/or  regeneration  upon  chronic  dosing  of 
≥50 mg/kg/day  in  monkeys  and  ≥100 mg/kg/day  in  rats.  The  impairments  of  renal  tubular  function 
were  concomitantly  indicated  by  increased  urine  volume,  decreased  urine  specific  gravity,  dose-
dependently  elevated  ratios  of  urinary  biomarkers  (albumin,  KIM-1,  NGAL,  osteopontin,  cystatin C) 
compared  to  creatinine  and/or  loss  of  urinary  phosphorus,  chloride  and  nitrogen.  These  renal  tubular 
deficiencies only partially recovered within four weeks post dosing. 
Moreover, DRF induced dose-dependent gastrointestinal disorders in rats and monkeys that resulted in 
reduced  body  weights  of  treated  animals  upon  continuous  DRF  treatment.  In  rats,  elevated  stomach 
weights  were  determined  at  DRF  doses  ≥60 mg/kg/day,  which  were  accompanied  by  hyperplasia  of 
squamous  mucosal  epithelia  in  the  non-glandular  part  of  the  stomach  and  duodenum  at 
≥150 mg/kg/day.  At  the  highest  DRF  dose  of  1000 mg/kg/day  in  a  dose-range  finding  study  in  rats, 
severe stomach erosion/ulceration, inflammation, haemorrhage, moderate oedema, fibroplasia and/or 
luminal exudate were evident. The poor gastrointestinal tolerability of DRF in the toxicity investigations 
in monkeys was characterised by dose-dependent emesis/vomitus at ≥15 mg/kg/day, which was also 
observed in six out of eight control monkeys of the chronic toxicity study pointing towards a contributing 
role of the acidic vehicle formulation. Still, pathological changes were restricted to monkeys administered 
DRF  and  comprised  stomach  irritation,  haemorrhage  and  inflammation  as  well  as  diarrhoea  at 
≥300 mg/kg/day.  Similar  to  the  non-glandular  stomach  counterpart  in  rats,  minimal  hyperplasia  of

squamous epithelia were further eminent in oesophagus and/or tongue of monkeys at 400 mg/kg/day 
in the 14 days and ≥25 mg/kg/day in the 91 days toxicity studies. 
Another common toxicity finding concerned the enlarged livers at DRF doses ≥100 mg/kg/day in toxicity 
studies in rats and at the 250 mg/kg/day high dose in the subchronic toxicity study in monkeys, which 
correlated  with  elevations  of  liver  enzymes  (alanine  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  and/or 
γ-glutamyltransferase) at higher dosages of ≥ 300 mg/kg/day in rats and the 1000 mg/kg/day top dose 
in  monkeys.  Triglyceride  and  cholesterol  levels  were  additionally  increased  at  lower  doses  of  ≥ 
50 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥250 mg/kg/day in monkeys. Liver effects generally emerged with dose- and 
time-dependent severity leading to incomplete reversibility after prolonged DRF administrations. 
In the initial dose-finding study in rats, increased lymphocytes were determined at the 1000 mg/kg DRF 
maximum  dose  that  could  have  represented  an  inflammatory  response  to  the  severe  gastrointestinal 
effects at this level. In contrast, DRF reduced lymphoid counts in thymus and spleen of monkeys leading 
to decreased lymphocytes in circulation at 400 mg/kg/day. Lymphocyte reductions were also confirmed 
in thymus and spleen of dead or preterm sacrificed rats of the 91 days subchronic toxicity study. Partially 
reversible haemolysis (decreased red cell mass and myeloid/erythroid ratio, increased reticulocytes) was 
evident at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in rats and monkeys and correlated with increased bilirubin at high dosages 
of 1000 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥300 mg/kg/day in monkeys. 
Contrary  to  rats,  five  out  of  six monkeys  administered  the  250 mg/kg/day  high  dose  in  the  91 days 
subchronic  toxicity  study  revealed  mild  physeal  dysplasia  due  to  chondrocyte  hypertrophy  and 
disorganisation in the proximal and distal femur as well as the proximal tibia. Physeal dysplasia did not 
reverse in one female in the recovery period and was therefore interpreted as adverse. No comparable 
findings were detected in rats or in monkeys during short-term administration of higher DRF dosages or 
following chronic treatment with lower doses. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  DRF  was  analysed 
in 
line  with 
ICH S2(R1) 
requirements 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008), whereas MMF and HES were tested for mutagenicity and chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro. DRF, MMF and HES were not mutagenic in bacteria. In contrast to HES, DRF and 
MMF  induced  chromosomal  aberrations  in vitro  at  concentrations  associated  with  >25%  mitotic 
reduction. Nevertheless, DRF was negative in the bone marrow micronucleus assay in vivo and also did 
not provide relevant induction of DNA strand breaks in liver or duodenum cells in the Comet assay in 
rats. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
DRF was not tumorigenic in a 26 week study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice. In a two-year bioassay in rats, 
Leydig cell adenomas in male testis were significantly increased and considered DRF treatment related. 
Effects in seminiferous tubules are most likely a secondary effect of Leydig cell adenomas. The human 
relevance of Leydig cell adenomas in the testis of rats is likely limited but still unclear and the margin of 
exposure of MMF in rats compared to clinical exposure in humans is low at the no-observed-adverse-
effect levels (NOAELs) for Leydig cell adenoma. In addition, kidney toxicities of dose-dependent severity 
were observed in mid and high dose males, which were interpreted as age-related chronic progressive 
nephropathy  (CPN).  Although  CPN  is  common  in  aged  rats,  however,  the  effect  was  significantly 
increased in mid and high dose DRF groups and commonly noticed in other toxicity studies in rats and 
monkeys.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A complete set of reproduction and developmental toxicity studies has been performed with DRF under 
the current standards as per ICH S5 (R3) guideline (EMA/CHMP/ICH/544278/1998). These investigations 
included  male  and  female  fertility  in  rats,  embryo-foetal  development  in  rats  and  rabbits  and  pre-
postnatal development in rats. In addition, the juvenile toxicity of DRF was studied for six weeks in rats. 
DRF did not impair male and female fertility in rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day and 450 mg/kg/day, 
respectively, representing the NOAELs for male and female fertility. The AUC-based exposure margins 
of MMF and HES at these NOAELs compared to human levels at the MRHD were approximately 7× and 
4×  in  male  rats  and  approximately  9×  and  4×  in  female  rats,  respectively.  Slight  increases  in  left 
epididymides weight and testes weight were each observed at doses ≥120 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg. 
In the rat embryo-foetal developmental study, skeletal variations, including reduced ossification of the 
skull  and  vertebral  arches,  were  seen  in  foetuses  of  dams  treated  with  DRF  at  the  highest  dose  of 
400 mg/kg.  At  this  dose  level,  maternal  toxicity  effects  of  decreased  body  weight  due  to  lower  food 
consumption and reduced foetal weight were noted. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg, which corresponds to 
a minor two-fold AUC-based exposure margin of MMF and HES compared to human levels at the MRHD. 
In the rabbit embryo-foetal developmental study, DRF-related maternal toxicity at the 350 mg/kg/day 
high dose comprised decreased defecation, body weight loss consequent to lower food consumption. In 
addition,  abortion  was  noticed  and  three females  had  to  be  euthanised  in extremis.  Transient  body 
weight loss and reduced food consumption were also seen in the 150 mg/kg/day mid dose group. Fetal 
examinations unveiled a higher incidence of post-implantation loss and subsequently lower mean litter 
proportion of viable fetuses in the 350 mg/kg dose group. Moreover, mean litter proportions of skeletal 
malformations were increased (vertebral centra anomaly, vertebral anomaly with associated rib anomaly 
and  severely  malaligned  sternebra[e])  and  skeletal  variation  (thirteenth  full  rib[s]).  Skeletal 
malformations (vertebral centra anomaly and severely malaligned sternebra[e]) were also observed in 
three fetuses  from  a  single  litter  of  the  mid  dose  group.  At  the  NOAEL  for  maternal  toxicity  and 
embryo/fetal  development  of  50 mg/kg/day,  the  AUC-based  exposure  margins  of  MMF  and  HES  were 
two-fold and 0.7-fold of human levels at the MRHD. 
The  placental  transfer  of  MMF  and  HES  following  DRF  administration  has  not  been  investigated  in 
pregnant  animals.  Nonetheless,  the  passage  of  MMF  across  the  placenta  into  foetal  blood  has  been 
reported  in  female  rats  and  rabbits,  with  a  foetal  to  maternal  plasma  ratio  of  0.48  to  0.64  and  0.1, 
respectively (see EPAR of “Tecfidera”). 
In the pre- and postnatal  development study in rats, DRF-related decreases in pup birth  weights and 
body weights/weight gains during the pre-weaning period were noted at the high dose of 400 mg/kg. 
Concomitantly, adverse treatment-related effects in F0 females included body weight loss and lower food 
consumption. No treatment-related adverse effects were observed on pre- and postnatal development 
(sexual maturation and neurobehaviour) and on reproduction of the F1 pups. Based on these findings, 
the  NOAELs  were  100 mg/kg/day  for  F0  females  and  400 mg/kg/day  for  F1  pups.  The  AUC-based 
exposure  margins  of  MMF  and  HES  at  the  NOAELs  compared  to  the  human  levels  at  the  MRHD  were 
three-fold and one-fold for F0 females and ten-fold and three-fold for F1 pups, respectively. Whereas 
DRF, MMF and RDC-8439 were not quantifiable in plasma of F1 pups, HES was determined on PND 4 and 
10 with pup concentrations of approximately 2 – 6% and 0.2 – 3% of those in F0 females. 
The  excretion  of  DRF  and  its  metabolites  MMF,  HES  and  HES  into  milk  has  not  been  investigated  in 
animals. However, the above data suggest the transfer of HES to pups via breast milk in rats, whereas 
transfer of DRF, MMF and RDC-8439 via breast milk has not been demonstrated.

In the six-week repeated dose juvenile toxicity study in rats, DRF administration between PND 25 and 
63,  which  corresponds  to  a  human  paediatric  population  of  around  2-16 years  old,  did  not  affect 
development,  behaviour  or  reproductive  performance.  With  the  exception  of  the  effects  on  the  bones 
(decreased femur size, mass, and density, changes in bone geometry), the target organ toxicities (renal 
tubule  cell  hypertrophy  and  hyperplasia  of  the  non-glandular  stomach)  were  comparable  to  those 
identified in DRF toxicity studies in adult rats. At the NOAEL in juvenile rats of 150 mg/kg/day, the AUC-
based  safety  margin  to  human  exposure  at  the  MRHD  for  MMF  and  HES  is  1.4-fold  and  1.5-fold, 
respectively. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  parameters  were  determined  at  the  beginning  and  termination  of  the  respective  dosing 
phases of the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. The DRF pro-drug was not 
quantifiable and the systemic exposure was primarily followed by means of MMF exposure. The inactive 
HES metabolite was only confirmed in chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, because a validated 
analytical  assay  was  not  earlier  established.  Accordingly,  the  HES  exposure  had  to  be  retrospectively 
estimated for shorter treatment durations by the help of bridging PK studies in both species that covered 
the respective toxicological dose ranges. Except fertility studies in male and female rats, toxicokinetic 
determinations  generally  revealed  low  safety  margins  of  MMF  and  HES  exposures  at  the  NOAELs  of 
standard toxicity, reproduction toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with regard to clinical levels of both 
major metabolites at the MRHD of DRF in humans. 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance 
The local tolerance of an extended release minitablet formulation of DRF was investigated for 14 days in 
monkeys administered once daily oral doses of 125 or 375 mg as one capsule or 840 mg as two capsules, 
respectively. Apart from mild reversible signs of haemolysis at the mid and high dose level, no systemic 
toxicities  were  unveiled.  This  seems  attributable  to  the  fixed  dose  regimen,  because  the  overall  low 
number of monkeys with wide age and body weight range resulted in variations of body weight adjusted 
DRF doses and, hence, variable MMF  exposures within study groups (e.g., the 840 mg/day high dose 
corresponded  to  approximately  100.5  to  218 mg/kg/day).  In  fact,  a  close  inspection  of  the  individual 
data  in  the  corresponding  study  report  revealed  minimal  but  statistically  significant  higher  weights  of 
kidneys  and  liver  in  males  of  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups,  which  had  been  similarly  determined  in 
repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  of  DRF  and  DMF  in  monkeys  (see  EPAR  of  “Tecfidera”).  In  addition, 
emesis/vomitus was seen in four out of six monkeys of the 840 mg/day extended release minitablet high 
dose group. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Lymphocyte declines were determined after oral DRF administration in subchronic toxicity studies in rats 
and monkeys and were similarly evident in clinical DRF studies, which has been adequately considered 
for risk minimisation measures (RMM) as previously approved for DMF. 
Dependence 
Secondary  PD  investigations  did  not  indicate  any  interaction  of  DRF,  MMF  or  HES  with  CNS  targets 
associated  with  dependence.  In  addition,  no  CNS-related  behavioural  abnormalities  or  withdrawal 
symptoms were identified in the non-clinical programme of DRF. 
Assessment report

Impurities 
DRF substance containing the RDC-2239 impurity from an early manufacturing process was investigated 
at doses up to 600 mg/kg DRF and 9 mg/kg RDC-2239 in a 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study in rats in 
comparison  to  DRF  material  without  this  impurity.  Systemic  toxicities  were  highly  coincident  with 
previous observations at similar DRF dosages and treatment durations in other toxicity studies in this 
species, and therefore not related to the RDC-2239 impurity. 
An  unsaturated  form  of  RDC-2239,  named  RDC-7935  was  identified  in  the  commercial  DRF 
manufacturing process and did not reveal any specific findings when contained in the DRF test substance 
in  the  14 days  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats.  Using  allometric  scaling  and  the  NOAEL  of 
600 mg/kg/day of this toxicity study, the applicant aimed to derive an acceptable level of RDC-7935. 
Not all parameters of this calculation can be agreed, because a lower human body weight of just 50 kg 
seemed more appropriate. Nevertheless, appropriate RDC-7935 limit has been actually proposed for the 
drug substance specification of DRF and can therefore be accepted from a toxicological point of view. 
Phototoxicity 
DRF substance containing the radioactive label inside the MMF moiety distributed into pigmented ocular 
and cutaneous tissues, which suggests melanin-binding. Nonetheless, DRF and its metabolites MMF, HES 
and RDC-8439 do not pose any phototoxic potential. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As DRF is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active metabolite MMF, the provided environmental 
risk assessment has been conducted for MMF. Based on prevalence data in Phase I, the PECsurface water 
had been refined resulting in a value of 0.64 µg/l that exceeds the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. Therefore, a 
Phase II risk assessment was provided. 
The  results  of  the  submitted  studies  demonstrate,  that  a  bioaccumulation  potential  of  MMF  is  not 
expected.  MMF  can  be  classified  as  readily  biodegradable  and  thus,  no  further  investigation  of 
environmental fate properties is required. MMF is also not expected to enter surface water or accumulate 
in sediments and therefore, an environmental assessment of MMF in the sediment compartment in Tier B 
is  not  necessary.  Furthermore,  no  risks  for  the  aquatic  environment  and  microorganisms  had  been 
identified for MMF.  
Based on the provided studies/information it can be concluded that MMF is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
DRF  is  rapidly  converted  by  ubiquitous  esterases  into  the  major  metabolites  MMF  and  HES.  MMF  was 
earlier  established  to  mediate  the  immunomodulatory  activity  of  DMF  (EMEA/H/C/2601;  “Tecfidera”). 
DRF, MMF and DMF comparably attenuated the development and severity of disabilities in the EAE model 
of human MS in rats. The MMF exposure of rats of the DRF group was approximately 11- to 13-fold and 
the HES exposure about 6.5- to 7-fold higher than the clinical Cmax and AUClast at the MRHD of 462 mg 
BID in RRMS patients. 
Mechanistically, DMF was earlier shown to induce the expression of Nrf2-dependent target genes, which 
could be eliminated by either downregulation of Nrf2 transcripts with specific siRNA or in Nrf2 / knockout 
mice (see EPAR of “Tecfidera”). The induction of Nrf2 target genes by DMF in the EAE model in rats was 
associated with dose-dependent inhibition of demyelination, cellular degeneration and interference with 
the activation of astrocytes, macrophages and microglia. Meanwhile, the Nrf2 activation in human RRMS 
patients receiving DMF-therapy has been correlated with effective disease remission and the selective 
reduction  of  CD8+  T cells  (Gopal  S  et  al.  2017;  Hammer  A  et al.,  2018;  Lückel  C  et al.,  2019).  The 
stimulation  of  Nrf2-dependent  transcripts  in  concert  with  MMF  levels  by  equimolar  doses  of  DRF  or 
dimethyl fumarate was confirmed in various tissues of mice, which indicates a comparable mechanistic 
basis of diroximel fumarate and dimethyl fumarate. The available knowledge on the mechanism of action 
of diroximel fumarate, MMF and dimethyl fumarate in animals and human patients is adequately reflected 
in Section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC. 
DRF and HES concentrations of 10 and 300 µM each did not reveal any secondary PD interaction with 
135 receptors,  transporters  and  enzymes,  which  coincides  with  results  obtained  at  up  to  30 µM

concentrations of DMF and MMF after marketing authorisation of “Tecfidera” (EMEA/H/C/2601/II/61/G). 
A follow-up investigation analysing MMF, HES or the combination of both major metabolites in 12 primary 
human cell culture systems revealed the known pharmacological effects of MMF, whereas HES proved to 
be inactive and did not affect the activity of MMF. The maximum HES concentration of 450 µM tested in 
this screening study was approximately 5-fold above the clinical level of 92.2 µM at the Cmax in RRMS 
patients  receiving  the  MRHD  (13.2 µg/ml).  Thus,  HES  is  considered  pharmacologically  inactive  at  the 
suggested clinical dosages. 
In safety pharmacological investigations of cardiovascular function, DRF and HES did not inhibit hERG 
currents  in vitro,  whereas  a  single  oral  400 mg/kg  DRF  dose  mildly  prolonged  the  QTc  interval  in 
telemetered monkeys (3 to 6 %). The MMF Cmax and AUC0-24h of the monkeys was > 30-fold and > 46-
fold  above  clinical  exposures  of  RRMS  patients  at  the  MRHD  (MMF  Cmax  of  2.11 µg/ml  and  AUClast  of 
4.15 µg·h/ml, respectively). The HES exposure was not determined, but based on a bridging PK study, 
it can be assumed that the HES exposure was > 8-fold (Cmax) and > 13-fold (AUC) above the levels in 
RRMS patients at the MRHD (Cmax of 13.2 µg/ml and AUClast of 88.6 µg·h/ml). In addition, the tmax of 
MMF  or  HES  in  monkeys  renders  any  relationship  unlikely.  DRF  is  therefore  considered  to  lack  any 
clinically  relevant  arrhythmogenic  potential,  which  coincides  with  existing  non-clinical  and  clinical 
experience of DMF (see EPAR of Tecfidera). Nevertheless, all monkeys of the 400 mg/kg DRF high dose 
group vomited within 24 hours after administration, which matches the gastrointestinal intolerabilities 
at  DMF  doses  ≥ 100 mg/kg  in  cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology  studies  in  dogs  known  from  the 
original MAA of Tecfidera or post-marketing (EPAR of “Tecfidera” and EMEA/H/C/2601/II/61/G). 
Likewise, oral DRF doses up to 600 mg/kg did not affect respiratory or CNS function in rats. Due to the 
velocity  of  the  pre-systemic  esterase  cleavage,  the  DRF  plasma  exposure  could  not  be  consistently 
determined. The MMF Cmax and AUC0-24h of the rats was > 20-fold above clinical levels of RRMS patients 
at  the  MRHD.  Retrospective  estimation  of  the  HES  exposure  using  pharmacokinetic  determinations  in 
rats suggests > 6-fold and > 13-fold higher Cmax and AUC compared to levels in RRMS patients at the 
MRHD. The absence of any effect of DRF on respiratory or CNS function is consistent with earlier findings 
obtained with DMF or a mixture of DMF and various fumarate salts (Fumaderm, see EPAR of Tecfidera). 
In view of these results from primary and secondary PD as well as safety pharmacology studies of DRF, 
MMF,  and  HES,  further  investigations  including  potential  PD  interactions  are  not  deemed  necessary, 
considering also the clinical experience from human RRMS therapy with DMF. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  accordance  with  previous  knowledge  from  DMF  (Tecfidera),  DRF  is  rapidly  and  pre-systemically 
cleaved by non-specific esterases, which does not involve the main hepatic enzymes and is not subject 
to gender or species differences. It is therefore accepted that only male animals were evaluated in PK 
studies. The velocity of the ester bond cleavage of DRF interfered with the determination of its systemic 
exposure in animals. 
As in humans, DRF was predominantly converted into the major metabolites MMF and HES in rats and 
monkeys. The AUC of HES was clearly higher than that of MMF in both species (18.3- to 39.6-fold in rats 
and 7.2- to 16.9-fold in monkeys), which covers the HES/MMF AUC ratio determined in plasma of RRMS 
patients after oral administration of the MRHD of 462 mg BID (21.3--fold. Both, MMF and HES extensively 
distributed throughout tissues of rats including pigmented ocular, cutaneous and adrenal structures that 
points  towards  melanin-binding  (for  evaluation  of  the  phototoxic  potential  see  below).  The  lack  of 
information regarding the potential milk transfer of MMF or HES, which is also unknown from the earlier 
license  of  DMF  (see  SmPC  of  Tecfidera),  was  adequately  considered  for  Section 4.6  of  the  proposed 
SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 26/148 
 
 
 
No  accumulation  of  MMF  or  HES  was  found.  In  line  with  previous  DMF  results,  MMF  was  further 
metabolised to fumaric acid that is subsequently transformed into glucose, water and carbon dioxide in 
the  evolutionarily  conserved  TCA  cycle  across  species.  In  the  mass  balance  study  in  rats,  significant 
amounts of the administered dose were consequently exhaled (35.91 %). HES was eliminated via urine 
to a considerably higher extent than MMF in rats (75.16 % vs. 12.33 %). The HES levels in human urine 
are similar (~58 to 63.4 %), while MMF is excreted in lower amounts (0.262 %). The principal clearance 
of DRF metabolites via the renal route compared to minimal amounts in faeces is consistent with DMF 
experience (see EPAR of “Tecfidera”; EMEA/H/C/2601). 
In addition to the MMF and HES main metabolites, RDC-8439 was confirmed as minor metabolite in rats 
and monkeys. Thus, human metabolic profiles were adequately reflected in rats and monkeys to study 
the pharmacological and toxicological characteristics of DRF (see below). 
Since  DRF,  MMF,  HES  and  RDC  8439  did  not  show  significant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  CYP 
enzymes, uptake or efflux transporters, the clinical risk for drug interactions after DRF dosing is regarded 
low, which is in line with current knowledge from therapeutic DMF administrations in RRMS and psoriasis 
patients (see EPAR and SmPC of Tecfidera, EMEA/H/C/2601, and Skilarence, EMEA/H/C/2157). 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of DRF, MMF and HES was studied in a stand-alone toxicology programme using rodent and 
non-rodent species that matched those previously tested for licensing of DMF (see EPAR of Tecfidera). 
The exposures of MMF and HES in animals were sufficient with respect to those in RRMS patients. 
In the 91-day subchronic toxicity study in rats, 3 out of 15 males administered the 450 mg/kg/day DRF 
high  dose  died  or  had  to  be  euthanised  in  extremis  due  to  cardiac  and  adventitial  inflammation  with 
associated  myocardial  necrosis.  These  cardiac  findings  were  similarly  detected  with  minimal  severity 
across  all  DRF  dose  groups  in  this  subchronic  toxicity  study,  the  chronic  toxicity  as  well  as  the 
carcinogenicity study of DRF in rats, but not in monkeys. In rats, these cardiac inflammations lack any 
obvious dose-response, could be also confirmed in vehicle-treated controls and were evident after either 
DRF, or DMF administration. An impact of HES on these cardiac toxicities is therefore unlikely. Instead, 
the cardiac changes appear to be attributable to common background lesions in rats that are exacerbated 
by  the  known  renal  toxicities  of  DRF  and  DMF,  oxidative  stress  and  prolonged  study  durations  with 
concomitant aging of the animals (Chanut et al., 2013; Greaves, 2012). This assumption is supported 
by pertinent literature that even suggests a presumptive cardioprotective role of Nrf2 activation (Chen 
and Maltagliati, 2018). Further confidence is gained by the absence of a particular cardiac hazard in the 
clinical development of diroximel fumarate or since marketing authorisation of DMF (see EPAR and SmPC 
of “Tecfidera”, EMEA/H/C/2601, and Skilarence, EMEA/H/C/2157).  
As  known  from  non-clinical  and  clinical  experience  with  DMF  (see  EPAR  and  SmPC  of  Tecfidera  and 
Skilarence), the kidney was the prominent toxicity target in rats and monkeys. The enlarged kidneys in 
both species were histologically associated with adverse kidney tubular degeneration/necrosis, cortical 
tubular hypertrophy and/or regeneration. The resulting impaired renal tubular function was evident by 
increased urine volume leading to increased excretion of urinary biomarkers and electrolytes and partially 
recovered upon cessation of dosing. The kidney toxicities developed at equivalent AUC-related MMF and 
HES  exposure  compared  to  human  levels  at  the  MRHD  in  both  rats  and  monkeys.  Still,  there  was  no 
evidence for a contribution of long-term HES exposure to the kidney toxicities. Accordingly, the warnings 
and undesirable effects in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC of DRF were aligned with those of 
Tecfidera.  
Another characteristic toxicity target concerned the dose-dependent gastrointestinal disturbances in rats 
and monkeys, which had been comparably identified in animals and human patients receiving DMF (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021

EPAR and SmPC of “Tecfidera” and “Skilarence”). The higher stomach weights of rats due to epithelial 
hyperplasia  in  the  non-glandular  part  of  the  stomach/duodenum  culminated  in  severe  stomach 
erosion/ulceration, inflammation, haemorrhage, moderate oedema, fibroplasia and/or luminal exudate 
at  the  MTD  of  DRF.  In  safety  pharmacological  and  toxicological  investigations  in  monkeys,  the 
gastrointestinal  intolerabilities  of  DRF  comprised  dose-dependent  emesis/vomitus  at  ≥15 mg/kg/day, 
which  correlated  with  stomach  irritation,  haemorrhage  and  inflammation  as  well  as  diarrhoea  at 
≥300 mg/kg/day. Higher doses resulted in epithelial hyperplasia in oesophagus and tongue of monkeys, 
which corresponds to the aforementioned increased epithelial proliferation in the non-glandular stomach 
of rats and might be directly related to MMF-mediated stimulation of the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 
(Motohashi et al., 2004). Of note, the change of the DRF oral gavage solution administered in toxicology 
studies to an extended-release DRF minitablet formulation still resulted in emesis/vomitus in 4 out of 
six monkeys administered  the  840 mg/day  high  dose  (approximately  100.5  to  218  mg/kg/day  due  to 
highly  variable  body  weight)  in  a  later  14 days  multiple  dose  local  tolerance  study.  In  view  of  the 
gastrointestinal disturbances in rats and monkeys, no safety margin with regard to clinical exposure at 
the  MRHD  of  DRF  in  RRMS  patients  could  be  established.  Consequently,  gastrointestinal  disorders 
constitute common/very common adverse drug reactions (ADR) in humans (see clinical assessment and 
SmPC). 
In accordance with earlier results obtained with DMF, dose-dependent liver hypertrophy was observed 
in association with elevated liver enzymes, triglycerides and cholesterol in rats and monkeys, which was 
incompletely reversible following prolonged DRF treatment. Compared to RRMS patients at the MRHD, 
the liver was affected at equivalent MMF and HES exposure in rats, whereas 4- to 15-fold safety margins 
might  be  deduced  from  the  observations  in  monkeys.  Nonetheless,  a  warning  for  drug-induced  liver 
injury has been implemented into Section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC consistent with clinical experience 
of DMF, which is agreed (cf. SmPC of Tecfidera). 
Furthermore, the haematological  alterations noted  after administration of DRF are comparably known 
from DMF treatments. Except lymphocyte increases at the MTD in rats that are attributable to severe 
gastrointestinal  inflammations,  DRF  generally  decreased  lymphocytes  in  thymus,  spleen  and  in 
circulation of rats and monkeys. Lymphopenia has been commonly observed during clinical RRMS therapy 
with DMF and involves reductions of CD4+ T helper cells and particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which 
possibly accounts for the higher susceptibility of these patients for opportunistic infections like herpes 
zoster  or  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63;  Fleischer  et al.,  2018; 
Hammer et al., 2018; Lückel et al., 2019). As both DRF and DMF exert their anti-inflammatory activity 
via the identical major metabolite MMF, the applicant proposes the same risk minimisation measures for 
DRF  as  meanwhile  implemented  for  DMF,  which  is  supported  in  line  with  ICH S8  requirements 
(CHMP/167235/2004). 
In  addition,  partially  reversible  haemolysis  was  determined  in  DRF-treated  rats  and  monkeys,  which 
corresponded to increased bilirubin at high dosages in these species. As these changes developed in the 
absence of relevant safety margins, regular monitoring of blood counts has already been considered for 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC in line with the established warning of Tecfidera, which is endorsed (cf. SmPC 
of Tecfidera). 
At  the  250 mg/kg  DRF  high  dose  in  the  91 days  subchronic  toxicity  study  in  monkeys,  chondrocyte 
hypertrophy and disorganisation in femur and tibia led to mild physeal dysplasia that did not reverse in 
one female and was, hence, considered adverse. Physeal dysplasia was not identified in monkeys during 
short-term administration of higher dosages or upon long-term  treatment with lower doses. It seems 
noteworthy  that  reduced  femur  length,  bone  mass  and  density  were  identified  in  juvenile  rats 
administered  the  600 mg/kg/day  DRF  high  dose  for  six weeks,  which  mirrored  the  decreased  bone 
mineralisation  in  juvenile  rats  following  DMF  doses  of  140 mg/kg/day  for  nine weeks  (see  below). 
Although  the  impaired  bone  growth  might  be  related  to  malnutrition  and  the  elevated  excretion  of 
Assessment report

Page 28/148 
 
 
 
electrolytes  in  the  study  animals  due  to  the  gastrointestinal  and  renal  toxicity  of  DRF  and  DMF  (see 
above),  current  scientific  knowledge  rather  stressed  the  importance  of  balanced  Nrf2  activation  for 
normal bone homeostasis (Hyeon et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Sun YX et al., 2015; Yamaguchi et al., 
2018; Yin et al., 2020; Sánchez-de-Diego et al., 2021). Bone deficiencies are more likely to manifest at 
younger age, which could explain the occurrence in the tested pre-pubertal monkeys and possibly also 
juvenile rats of the DRF toxicology programme, but not in the more mature adult rats. Apparently, bone 
findings depend on the administered dose, the treatment duration and the age of the animals. As physeal 
dysplasia only developed with a 15-fold safety margin with regard to MMF exposure at the MRHD of DRF, 
no increased human risk is presently envisaged considering also the restriction of the proposed indication 
of DRF to adult RRMS patients. Moreover, physeal dysplasia determined in monkeys has been adequately 
delineated in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
DRF, MMF and HES did not exhibit any mutagenic potential. Nonetheless, DRF and MMF, but not HES, 
induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro at concentrations associated with >25 % mitotic reduction. In 
the bone marrow and Comet assay in vivo, DRF did not induce micronuclei or strand breaks in liver and 
duodenum cells. Hence, DRF bares no clinically relevant genotoxic potential. 
DRF was not tumorigenic in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice, but significantly increased Leydig cell adenomas 
in the testes and possible secondary effects in seminiferous tubules in a two year bioassay in rats. The 
unknown human relevance of Leydig cell adenomas in the testis of rats and the low safety margin of 
MMF  exposure  in  rats  compared  to  levels  at  the  MRHD  in  humans  has  been  adequately  reflected  in 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
DRF did not impair male and female fertility in rats, but slight increases in the weight of left epididymides 
and testes were each observed at doses ≥120 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg. These changes were reported as 
unrelated to treatment, because they might have been secondary to DRF-related effects on body weight, 
did not occur in a dose-dependent manner, and/or mean absolute epididymis and testis weights at these 
dosage levels were similar to controls. Nevertheless, effects in the epididymides and/or testes (minimal 
germinal epithelial degeneration, increased incidence of giant spermatids, slight decrease in spermatids 
in the tubular epithelium, and reduced testes weight) were also observed in CByB6F1 mice (wild-type 
littermates of rasH2 transgenic mice) and the two year rat carcinogenicity study (increased incidence of 
testicular Leydig cell adenomas associated with increased incidence and severity of seminiferous tubule 
degeneration/atrophy  in  testes  and  oligospermia/germ  cell  debris  in  the  epididymides)  with  DRF  and 
have been also described for DMF (see EPAR of Tecfidera). Therefore, a relationship of the testes and 
epididymides  effects  in  the  male  fertility  study  to  DRF-treatment  cannot  be  excluded.  However,  the 
effects  were  only  slight,  not  considered  adverse  and  did  not  impact  on  male  fertility.  Histopathology 
findings  in  reproductive  organs  other  than  those  described  in  the  testes  have  not  been  observed  in 
repeat-dose toxicity or carcinogenicity studies. 
The diminished ossification seen in the rat embryo-foetal developmental study might be attributable to 
the maternal toxicity, because delayed ossification as a result of maternal feeding restriction has been 
observed in rats (Nitzsche, 2017) and was similarly reported for DMF (see EPAR of Tecfidera). 
A higher incidence of skeletal malformations and variation in rabbits treated with DRF in the embryo-
foetal developmental study has been observed with little or no safety margin to human exposure at the 
NOAEL. At present, it cannot be excluded that the induction of skeletal malformations and variations in 
rabbits  occurs  via  a  direct  effect  of  DRF  and/or  its  metabolites.  Since  the  incidence  of  skeletal 
malformations was low without evidence of a causative mechanism and since it occurred in rabbits only 
but not in rats, the human relevance of these findings is currently unknown, which has been appropriately 
considered for instructions in the SmPC and PL, respectively. Still, the potential human risk should be 
closely monitored in the pregnancy registry studies.

No DRF-related adverse effects (AEs) were observed on pre- and postnatal development in rats (sexual 
maturation and neurobehaviour) and on the reproduction of the F1 pups. 
In juvenile rats, DRF administration between PND 25 and 63 also did not affect development, behaviour 
or  reproductive  performance  and  target  organ  toxicities  matched  those  identified  in  adult  rats  (see 
above). Although some changes in the bones of juvenile rats may be associated with lower body weights, 
a direct effect of DRF on bone development cannot be excluded given the abnormal physeal dysplasia in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. These effects are of limited relevance for treatment of adult RRMS patients. The 
relevance for paediatric patients is currently unknown, which has been satisfactorily implemented into 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
DMF has been established to lack a clinically relevant dependence potential in self-administration and 
drug discrimination studies. As DRF and DMF solely act via the MMF metabolite, specific investigations 
of the dependence potential of DRF are therefore not required in accordance with the tiered approach of 
the pertinent European guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004). 
In rats, DRF was found to distribute into melanin-containing pigmented ocular and cutaneous tissues. 
However, the applicant confirmed that DRF, MMF, HES and RDC-8439 do not absorb in the UV/visible 
light spectrum of 290 to 700 nm. For this reason, no further phototoxic testing in accordance with the 
tiered approach of the ICH S10 guideline is required (EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012). 
Considering the submitted data, DRF is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant had previously addressed all non-clinical concerns. Meanwhile, the SmPC and PL have been 
adequately revised in accordance with CHMP requests. For this reason, approval is recommended from 
a non-clinical perspective. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
DRF has been developed for the treatment of RRMS. 
The starting dose for diroximel fumarate is 231 mg twice a day orally. After seven days, the dose should 
be increased to the recommended maintenance dose of 462 mg DRF (administered as two 231 mg DRF 
capsules) twice a day orally. Temporary dose reductions to 231 mg DRF twice a day may be considered 
for individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dose. Within one month, the recommended dose of 
462 mg DRF twice a day should be resumed. 
This MAA includes data for both DRF and DMF. The clinical efficacy and safety package relies primarily 
on  DMF  data  already  submitted  and  assessed  by  the  EMA  and  ten  completed  Phase  1  studies  and  1 
completed and 1 ongoing Phase 3 studies with DRF. 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Study Overview 
Countries involved 
Regulatory Status 
In this dose-ranging study of 256 
participants who received at least 1 
dose of placebo or BG00012 120 
mg QD, 120 mg TID, or 240 mg 
TID, BG00012 240 mg TID was 
determined to have a favourable 
benefit-risk profile and was selected 
for further clinical evaluation in the 
confirmatory, pivotal Phase 3 
clinical studies. 
In this study of 1237 randomised 
participants, treatment with 
BG00012 administered as 240 mg 
BID and TID over two years 
significantly reduced the occurrence 
of clinical exacerbations, reduced 
the risk of confirmed 12-week 
disability progression, and 
improved nearly all MRI measures 
of MS disease activity, compared 
with placebo. 
In this study of 1430 randomised 
participants, treatment with 
BG00012, administered as 240 mg 
BID or TID significantly reduced 
clinical relapses over the two-year 
treatment period and improved 
nearly all MRI measures of disease 
activity, compared with placebo. A 
clinical meaningful reduction in 
disability progression was observed 
in both the BG00012 BID and TID 
groups, with reductions in the risk 
of confirmed disability progression. 
The PK, efficacy, and safety results 
in 22 paediatric participants in this 
study were consistent with the 
overall BG00012 dimethyl fumarate 
experience to date in adult healthy 
volunteers and adult participants 
with RRMS. In this study of 22 
paediatric participants with RRMS, 
dimethyl fumarate administration 
during a 24-week Treatment Period 
was effective in reducing brain MRI 
lesions. PK parameters in paediatric 
and adult participants were 
comparable. The safety and 
tolerability profile of dimethyl 
fumarate was consistent with that 
observed in previously conducted 
studies in adult participants with 
RRMS.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
DRF (also referred to as ALKS 8700 and RDC-5108) is an orally administered fumarate ester that has 
been developed for the treatment RMS. DRF is a prodrug and its active moiety MMF is identical to that 
of the approved drug dimethyl fumarate (DRF; Tecfidera™). 
The pharmacology of DRF and its metabolites was investigated in 13 clinical studies and two population 
PK (PopPK) analyses. The clinical studies include assessments of single- and multiple-dose PK, ADME, 
relative bioavailability, the effects of food, the impact of coingestion of alcohol, a thorough QT study, a 
renal impairment study, and a digoxin DDI study. In addition, four DMF clinical studies provided data 
that were relevant to the DRF clinical programme. These include an ADME study, 2 DDI studies, and a 
Phase 2 paediatric study. 
The MAA for DRF relies on a PK bridging approach to Tecfidera (DMF). To make use of DMF efficacy, and 
to  a  lesser  extent,  safety  data,  bioequivalence  had  to  be  established.  As  both  DRF  and  DMF  undergo 
rapid presystemic hydrolysis to the active component MMF bioequivalence had to be established for the 
active moiety. MMF exposure (AUC and Cmax) following administration of DRF 462 mg in the fasted state 
was shown to be bioequivalent to that following the administration of DMF 240 mg in the fasted state. 
There  was  also  no  clinically  relevant  impact  on  MMF  AUC  in  the  presence  of  a  high-fat/high-calorie, 
medium-fat/medium-calorie, or low-fat/low-calorie meal. While there was a reduction in Cmax, with the 
largest  reduction  observed  with  the  high-fat/high-calorie  meal,  the  Cmax  reduction  observed  with  DRF 
was in line with the reduction observed with DMF 240 mg administered in the presence of high-fat/high-
caloric meal. Therefore, DRF can be administered with or without food and in both cases shows equivalent 
exposure to DMF.  
After  oral  administration  DRF  was  almost  completely  absorbed.  MMF  concentration-time  profiles 
displayed  high  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  and  irregular  shape  which  may  in  part  be  due  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 34/148 
 
 
 
multiple  absorption  sites  along  the  GI  tract.  PK  parameter  estimates  are  highly  variable,  with  the 
exception of AUC. This indicates that, despite the high IIV and the irregular shapes of the concentration-
time profiles, DRF administration yields stable and consistent MMF exposures. 
DRF is immediately metabolised to the active moiety MMF and the primary, inactive metabolite HES and 
to  a  lesser  extent  another  inactive  metabolite,  RDC-8439.  Metabolism  of  MMF  is  well  established  and 
occurs via esterases followed by the TCA cycle, and the primary route of MMF elimination is exhalation 
of CO2. MMF was eliminated rapidly from plasma with a mean half-life (t½) of around 0.6 to 0.9 hours. 
HES is primarily excreted unchanged in urine and to a lesser extent further metabolised to two additional 
minor metabolites. HES was eliminated more slowly from plasma with a mean t½ of around 8 to 22 hours. 
MMF  and  HES  exposures  were  dose-proportional  after  single  and  multiple  doses.  Minimal  or  no  MMF 
accumulation (0.9- to 1.2-fold) was observed after BID dosing. HES exhibited a t½ in plasma that was 
greater than the dosing interval, resulting in a 2.1- to 2.5-fold accumulation with BID administration of 
DRF. HES exposure was 10- to 13-fold greater than MMF exposure at steady state in healthy participants. 
As expected, a renal impairment study found no influence of renal impairment on MMF exposure, the 
AUC of HES however increased with renal impairment severity. The popPK model predicts an about two-
fold increase of steady state AUC, as the metabolite is however not active this is considered clinically not 
relevant. 
A  hepatic  impairment  study  was  not  conducted,  as  the  cytochrome  system  is  not  involved  in  DRF 
metabolism. The low DDI potential of DRF was confirmed in a series of in vitro inhibition and induction 
studies. 
The  popPK  analyses  revealed  a  correlation  of  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  with  body  weight. 
Thus, patients with lower body weight will show higher exposure at the same dose. This will be especially 
important in potential future dosing in paediatric patients. 
In the thorough QT study, administration of multiple BID doses of DRF up to a supratherapeutic dose of 
924 mg had no clinically significant effect on QTc interval. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The Application for DRF relies on a PK bridging approach to the authorised product Tecfidera®. Therefore, 
no new PD data were provided. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This MAA is based on a pharmacologic bridging approach to the authorised product DMF (Tecfidera®). 
Bioequivalence to DMF has been shown for the active moiety MMF. A similar food effect for both DRF and 
DMF could also be shown; therefore, DRF can be given with instructions for intake similar to Tecfidera®. 
The inactive metabolite HES is only found when DRF is administered and not for DMF. In fact, due to its 
long  t½,  it  is  the  primary  metabolite  found  in  plasma  at  exposure  10-  to  13-fold  greater  than  MMF 
exposure at steady state. HES metabolism and excretion was therefore better characterised in a mass-
balance  study.  It  was  found  to  be  excreted  primarily  unchanged  in  urine  and  only  undergoing  minor 
additional metabolism. 
MMF and HES pharmacology were further characterised in a renal impairment study. As expected, MMF 
PK was unchanged while a severity dependent increase in HES exposure was found. This is, however, 
considered not to be clinically relevant.

These  key  findings  support  that  DRF  can  be  given  in  bioequivalent  doses,  following  the  general 
recommendation for dosing and intake established for DMF (Tecfidera®). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
DRF pharmacology has been thoroughly investigated. The key findings support the authorisation in the 
same indication as DMF (Tecfidera). 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No  formal  efficacy  studies  using  typical  MS  disease  endpoints  with  DRF  have  been  completed  or  are 
ongoing. Dedicated pivotal studies comparing head-to-head the efficacy of DRF and DMF in RRMS, using 
efficacy assessments relevant to MS primary endpoints have not been performed either. There are two 
Phase  3  studies  (one  completed)  with  DRF  with  exploratory  efficacy  clinical  endpoints  and  MRI 
measurements. However, the total number of studies appears to be sufficient, taking into account that 
DRF  is  not  a  new  active  substance  and  the  experience  accumulated  with  DMF-MMF.  DRF  can  be 
considered  a  prodrug  leading  to  the  main  active  moiety/metabolite,  MMF,  which  has  already  been 
sufficiently investigated with DMF. In this AR, a presentation will follow with first the studies with DRF 
and then the main studies with DMF in a combined way and a joint presentation to the maximum possible 
extent. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
DRF Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers have shown that, at the investigative dose, DRF and 
DMF produce bioequivalent exposure to MMF, which are expected to result in similar efficacy and safety 
profiles.  
Three  Phase  1  bioavailability  studies  (ALK8700-A103,  ALK8700-A104,  and  ALK8700-A109)  provide 
sufficient  data  to  establish  comparability  of  the  PK  of  MMF  after  oral  administration  of  DRF  and  DMF 
under a number of dietary conditions. Exposure of MMF after a DRF dose of 462 mg was shown to be 
bioequivalent to MMF after the 240 mg dose of DMF under fasted conditions and after a high-fat meal. 
The Cmax of MMF after a dose of DRF was highly variable, similar to that observed with DMF. Under all 
tested conditions, the Cmax of MMF after a 462 mg dose of DRF was within the range of the Cmax observed 
with 240 mg of DMF. 
After a single oral dose of DRF, MMF showed a plasma exposure that was dose-proportional in the range 
of 49 to 980 mg. MMF exposure after multiple-dose administration of DRF also appeared to increase in 
a dose proportional manner across the dose range of 210, 420, and 630 mg. 
Similarly, the dose proportionality analysis for HES in plasma after a single oral administration of DRF 
showed that plasma exposure was dose-proportional in the range of 49 to 980 mg. These results were 
also supported by multiple-dose results, which found that HES exposure appeared to increase in a dose 
proportional manner across the DRF dose range of 210, 420, and 630 mg. 
Safety  data  from  Phase  1  studies  (Study  ALK8700-001,  ALK8700-A102,  and  ALK8700-A110)  indicate 
that BID doses up to 924 mg were sufficiently well tolerated, with no relevant differences in safety or 
tolerability between single or repeated dosing at each level. 
The selection of a 462 mg DRF maintenance dose was based on three comparative bioavailability studies 
(Studies  ALK8700-A103,  ALK87800-A104,  and  ALK8700-A109).  DRF  462  mg  and  DMF  at  commercial 
doses (240mg) demonstrated bioequivalent exposure (AUC) of MMF across a variety of tested dietary

conditions. The effect of food on MMF PK after administration of DRF was very similar to the effect of 
food  on  DMF  PK.  MMF  exposure  after  administration  of  DRF  was  consistent  with  exposure  after  DMF 
administration in the fasted condition. 
2.6.5.2.  Main studies 
The Phase 3 clinical programme for DRF includes one completed Phase 3, double-blind  study to evaluate 
the comparative GI tolerability of DRF and DMF (Study A302 [EVOLVE-MS2]) and one ongoing Phase 3, 
OL safety study of DRF (Study A301 [EVOLVE-MS1], ongoing). 
Four DMF studies are particularly relevant in supporting the dosing, efficacy, and safety for DRF: a Phase 
2 placebo-controlled dose-finding study for DMF (Study C-1900), a two-year, placebo-controlled Phase 
3  study  (Study  109MS301),  a  two-year,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  study  with  an  active  comparator 
(Study 109MS302), and OLE study (Study109MS303). Study 109MS303 interim efficacy and safety data 
were submitted with the Tecfidera MAA and the final efficacy data are presented for the OLE of the study. 
The primary evaluation of DRF efficacy is based on a PK bridging approach between DRF and DMF with 
respect to the active metabolite MMF, and no placebo-controlled clinical efficacy study with typical MS 
disease  endpoints  was  conducted  in  the  DRF  clinical  programme.  Treatment  effect  over  time  is  being 
assessed in the long term, OL Study A301 using exploratory efficacy, clinical, and MRI endpoints. 
Study A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2) 
This was a randomised, DB, Phase 3, multicentre study in adult participants with RRMS conducted in two 
parts for five weeks, designed to evaluate the GI tolerability of DRF compared to that of DMF using the 
Individual  GI  Symptom  and  Impact  Scale  (IGISIS)  and  the  Global  GI  Symptom  and  Impact  Scale 
(GGISIS) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DRF. 
Methods (A302) 
Parts A and B were identical in study design and included a five-week, DB treatment period with two 
blind treatment arms (DRF and DMF). The first 120 eligible participants were randomised to one of the 
two treatment groups in Part A (n = 60 per group).

Participants completing the 5-week treatment period either continued into the safety study A301 or entered the safety follow-up period 
and returned at Visit 9.  
The study had an adaptive design such that data from Part A could be used to modify the GI tolerability 
endpoints  and  sample  size  in  the  study.  Part  A  was  exploratory.  Following  completion  of  Part  A,  the 
applicant conducted  a planned, unblinded  exploratory analysis of the Part A GI tolerability and safety 
data  to  inform  the  endpoint  selection  for  the  overall  study.  The  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  was 
updated  following  the  review  of  Part  A  data.  This  adaptive  approach  was  taken  to  better  inform  the 
sample size of Part B and the overall study analysis given that the endpoints were based on exploratory 
GI symptom scales that were being used for the first time 
•  Study Participants (A302) 
The study included RRMS patients aged 18 to 65 years old with an EDSS between 0 and 6 at screening 
and  at  randomisation  and  neurologically  stable  with  no  evidence  of  relapse  within  30  days  prior  to 
randomisation. 
The first 120 eligible subjects were randomised to one of the two treatment groups in Part A (n=60 per 
group).  Subjects  who  were  randomised  in  Part  A  were  not  eligible  to  participate  in  Part  B.  Once 
randomisation for Part A was complete, the next 386 eligible subjects were randomised into one of the 
two treatment groups in  Part B (194  subjects in the DRF group and  192  subjects in the DMF group). 
Subjects completing the entire five-week DB treatment in Parts A or B were eligible to roll over into the 
OL  long-term  safety Study  A301. Subjects  not  rolling  over  to Study  A301  completed  a  follow-up  visit 
(Visit 9). 
It  is  noted  that  due  to  the  adaptive  design,  endpoints  and  sample  size  of  Part  B  in  Study  A302  was 
finalised  after  the  unblinded  data  from  exploratory  Part  A  had  been  examined.  Upon  identifying  the 
primary endpoint, a sample size recalculation was conducted based on assumptions learned from Part 
A.  
Due to the unblinded interim analysis after which the final version of the SAP was generated pooling of 
both parts cannot be accepted as a valid procedure. Only Part B data should be taken into account for 
the conclusions regarding the primary objective. The number of subjects in Part B, 386 in total (194 in 
the ALKS 8700 group and 192 in the DMF group) can be considered sufficient to allow for comparative 
results with DMF for short term GI tolerability.

Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 blind treatment groups, 
as follows: 
-  Group 1: DRF 462 mg BID, taken orally (with one-week titration) 
-  Group 2: DMF 240 mg BID, taken orally (with one-week titration) 
In each part, both ALKS 8700 and DMF were administered orally BID as blinded study drug. Both ALKS 
8700  462  mg  BID  and  DMF  240  mg  BID  had  an  initial  one-week  dose  titration  period.  Subjects  were 
instructed to take study drug with or without food and to avoid taking study drug with a high-fat, high-
calorie meal.

No dose reductions were permitted during the study. If a subject did not tolerate the study drug during 
the initial one-week dose titration period or after the dose titration period, the subject was discontinued 
from the study. 
The study duration for both Parts A and B was in total approximately 11 weeks for all subjects in the US 
and approximately 11 weeks for male subjects and 13 weeks for female subjects in Poland and Germany. 
The study duration included up to four weeks for screening, including a one-week lead-in period (prior 
to randomisation), a five-week double-blind Treatment Period (including one-week titration), and up to 
two follow-up periods (a two-week follow-up [all subjects] and a four-week follow-up [female subjects 
in Poland and Germany only]) for subjects not continuing in the ALK8700-A301 long-term safety study. 
Taking into consideration the available PK data, the outcome of the comparative bioavailability studies 
and  the  bioequivalence  data  with  DMF,  the  doses  and  administration  schemes  are  considered 
appropriate. 
•  Objectives (A302) 
•  To evaluate the utility of two GI symptom scales (IGISIS and GGISIS) and endpoints derived from 
the scales in assessing GI tolerability in adult subjects with RRMS after administration of ALKS 8700 
or DMF in Part A 
•  To  compare  the  GI  tolerability  of  ALKS  8700  and  DMF  in  adult  subjects  with  RRMS  using  two  GI 
symptom scales (IGISIS and GGISIS) with endpoints informed from Part A 
•  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALKS 8700 in adult subjects with RRMS in Parts A and B 
The objectives of the study were not a direct comparison of DRF and DMF using relevant for MS efficacy 
endpoints. A different approach was followed by the applicant in an effort to show better GI tolerability

for  DRF  compared  to  DMF  (see  below).  With  respect  to  the  scales  used,  please  see  comments  in  the 
Endpoints section.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints (A302) 
Study A302 is primarily a safety study designed to evaluate the GI tolerability of DRF compared to that 
of DMF. 
GI Tolerability endpoints  
GI  tolerability  was  determined  using  the  IGISIS  and  GGISIS  scales.  According  to  the  applicant,  the 
IGISIS and GGISIS instruments were adapted from validated scales used to assess flushing in patients 
treated  with  niacin  [Paolini  2008].  They  were  used  in  this  study  to  assess  GI  tolerability  in  adult 
participants treated with DRF and DMF [Fox 2016]. 
The  primary  GI  tolerability  endpoint  was  the  number  of  days  with  any  IGISIS  individual  symptom 
intensity score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days in Part A and Part B. 
The IGISIS is designed to assess the incidence, intensity, onset, duration, and functional impact of five 
individual GI symptoms: nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. 
Subjects  rated  the  severity  of  each  individual  symptom  via  an  11-point  numeric  rating  scale  ranging 
from 0 (did not have) to 10 (extreme). Subjects rated how much each symptom interfered with their 
ability to accomplish their regular daily activities using a 5-point Likert scale (“Not at all” <“Slightly” < 
“Moderately” < “Quite a bit” < “Extremely”). An interference score is not reported for a symptom when 
the intensity score is 0 or if the symptom is still ongoing. 
The GGISIS is a global scale to assess the overall intensity, bothersomeness, and functional impact of 
GI  symptoms  (nausea,  vomiting,  upper  abdominal  pain,  lower  abdominal  pain,  and  diarrhoea) 
experienced  during  the  previous  24  hours.  Subjects  rated  the  intensity  and  bothersomeness  of  GI 
symptoms via an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (did not have) to 10 (extreme). Subjects 
rated how much each symptom interfered with their ability to accomplish their regular daily activities 
and,  if  employed,  with  their  work  productivity  using  5  point  Likert  scales  (“Not  at  all”  <“Slightly”  < 
“Moderately” < “Quite a bit” < “Extremely”). Subjects also indicated whether they were employed at the 
time of completing the GGISIS and, if employed, the hours of work missed due to GI symptoms during 
the past 24 hours. 
The  IGISIS  and  GGISIS  were  completed  by  subjects  using  e-diaries.  Subjects  completed  both  scales 
using  e-diaries  daily  during  a  one-week  lead-in  period  prior  to  randomisation  (Visit  3)  to  facilitate 
familiarity with the scales as well as to evaluate for exclusionary GI symptomatology. 
The GGISIS and IGISIS scales have been used similarly to the FSQ. During validation of the FSQ, the 
percentage of days with a score above a threshold of 1 and 4 were found to significantly discriminate 
among groups using FSQ. However, it is still unclear what difference between the assessed therapies 
constitutes a minimal significant clinical difference for IGISIS and GGISIS. The applicant has selected as 
endpoint the Number of Days with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days 
(which are approximately 35) and not ≥3, ≥ 4, ≥ 5 or ≥ 6. It should be noted that the Number of Days 
with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥3 is below 1 for ALKS 8700 (DRF) (0.9) for Part A and B 
combined  and  Part  B  only  (0.7).  These  numbers  are  very  low  to  draw  any  clinically  meaningful 
conclusions and are questioning the clinical usefulness of these scales.  
Secondary GI tolerability endpoints included the following: 
•  Number of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days 
in Part B

•  Number of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 1 relative to exposure days 
in Part A and Part B

Other Assessments  
Treatment effect over time was also assessed in an exploratory manner using the following (details of 
these structured interviews and questionnaires are provided in the protocol): 
•  Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): This scale is used to measure and evaluate the 
level of functioning of patients with MS. Categories include ambulatory ability and Functional System 
scores:  pyramidal  (motor  function);  cerebellar;  brainstem;  sensory;  bowel  and  bladder;  visual; 
cerebral or mental; and other. The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. 
The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent 
levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The Functional Systems are scored on a scale 
of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed 
clinically. 
•  MS Relapse: Protocol-defined relapse is described in the protocol. 
•  Timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW): The T25-FW (Kaufman et al, 2000) is a reliable quantitative mobility 
and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk. 
•  12-item Short-Form health survey (SF-12): Quality of life was assessed using the SF-12 Version 2. 
•  EuroQoL Group Health Outcome Measure 5-Level Version (EQ-5D-5L): This measure is designed to 
assess  decrements  in  health,  based  on  a  descriptive  system  that  defines  health  in  terms  of  five 
dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression.

Given the short duration of this study, the primary reason for including the EDSS, T25-FW, SF-12, and 
EQ-5D-5L assessments was to obtain pre-treatment baseline values for participants who rolled over from 
this study into the A301 study. Changes from baseline for EDSS, T25-FW, SF-12, and EQ-5D-5L scores 
over a 5-week treatment period were not expected to be clinically meaningful. 
It should be noted that with respect to the other endpoints, MS relevant assessments using EDSS, T25-
FW, SF-12, and EQ-5D-5L were not expected to be clinically meaningful given the short duration of the 
study, as admitted by the applicant. However, some indications on the efficacy of DRF in MS could be 
obtained. These assessments could be considered supportive,  complement  the bioequivalence studies 
and provide further support for the approval of DRF based on DMF efficacy data.  
Analysis of MRI Endpoints 
Baseline MRI parameters (number of gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) lesions, GdE lesion number category 
[0,  1  through  4,  5  through  8,  and  ≥  9],  T2  lesion  volume,  and  normalised  brain  volume)  were 
summarised by treatment group and overall. 
Safety  throughout  the  study  was  assessed  using  the  following:  AEs,  Vital  signs  (oral  temperature, 
respiratory  rate,  heart  rate,  and  blood  pressure),  clinical  laboratory  parameters  (blood  biochemistry, 
haematology, and urinalysis [including urine albumin, urine beta-2-microglobulin, and urine creatinine]), 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (uncorrected QT, QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula, 
QT  interval  corrected  using  Bazett’s  formula,  PR,  RR,  and  QRS  intervals),  Columbia-Suicide  Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS). 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) (A302) 
This was a randomised DB study. 
•  Statistical methods (A302) 
The study had an adaptive design such that data from Part A could be used to modify the GI tolerability 
endpoints  and  sample  size  in  the  study.  Following  completion  of  Part  A,  the  applicant  conducted  a 
planned,  unblinded  exploratory  analysis  of  the  Part  A  GI  tolerability  and  safety  data  to  inform  the 
endpoint selection for the overall study. The SAP was updated following the review of Part A data. This 
adaptive approach was taken to better inform the sample size of Part B and the overall study analysis 
given that the endpoints were based on exploratory GI symptom scales that were being used for the first 
time. This clinical study report presents the combined final results of Parts A and B.  
In  general,  summary  statistics  (n,  mean,  standard  deviation  [SD],  median,  minimum,  and  maximum 
values for continuous variables, and number and percentage of subjects in each category for categorical 
variables) are provided by treatment group for evaluated variables. All summary tables were based on 
observed data, and missing values were not imputed unless otherwise indicated. 
Measurements  collected  from  unscheduled  visits  or  repeated  assessments  were  not  included  in  the 
by-visit  summary  tables  or  figures  but  were  included  in  the  analyses  for  the  potentially  clinically 
significant (PCS) postbaseline values and subject listings. Source data for summary tables and statistical 
analyses are presented as by-subject data listings. 
Baseline value was defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to the first dose of study drug. All 
statistical tests and confidence intervals (CIs), unless stated otherwise, are two-sided and set at 0.05 
level of significance. 
All of the efficacy analyses were summarised by the planned treatment assignment, and all of the safety 
analyses were summarised by the actual treatment. 
The data were summarised for the following two study periods as appropriate: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021

•Treatment  Period,  which  was  defined  as  the  period  between  the  first  dose  date  after 
randomisation and the last dose date plus 1 day, inclusive. 
•Follow-up period, which was defined as the period between the last dose date plus 2 days and 
the last study date. 
The number  of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥  2 (event days) is counted 
among observed diaries. Exposure days are the number of days between a subject’s first dose date and 
last dose date during treatment period, inclusive. Let 
 (1) and 
 (2) denote the mean number of days 
with  any  IGISIS  individual  symptom  intensity  scores  ≥  2,  for  ALKS  8700  and  DMF,  respectively.

Comparison of GI tolerability will be tested at 5% level of significance in a two-sided test, through the 
following hypothesis of no treatment effect:

value is less than 0.05 (in a 2-sided test). DMF will be claimed superior to ALKS-8700 if the estimated θ 
𝜃𝜃
(2) is less than the estimated 
 (1) and p-value is less than 0.05 (in a 2-sided test). 
Event days will be analysed by the negative binomial regression model, including treatment as factor 
𝜃𝜃
and adjusting for study parts (not included in part B only analyses), region (US and non-US), age and 
Body  Mass  Index  (BMI).  Additional  covariates  may  also  be  included  in  the  model.  The  logarithmic 
transformation of exposure days will be included in the model as the “offset” parameter. If the data are 
underdispersed, or if the negative binomial regression model does not converge, a Poisson regression 
model  with  the  same  covariates  will  be  used  instead  of  the  negative  binomial  regression  model. 
Dispersion will be evaluated from the Pearson Chi-square statistic. If the ratio of the Pearson Chi-square 
statistic to the degrees of freedom is ≤ 1 which indicates no overdispersion, then a Poisson regression 
model  with  adjustment  for  underdispersion  will  be  used.  Count  distributions  in  which  the  number  of 
intervals  with  zero  events  is  higher  than  predicted  by  a  Negative  binomial  or  Poisson  model  may  be 
modelled using a Zero-inflated model. 
This method will also be used for the secondary endpoints by setting the GI symptom intensity score cut 
off as one and three. Empirical cumulative distribution function plot of number of event days by treatment 
groups will be presented.  
Worst IGISIS symptom intensity score by week during the five-week treatment period:  
Worst individual IGISIS symptom intensity score is defined as a subject’s worst (i.e., highest) symptom 
intensity score for any symptom out of all completed IGISIS diaries during a given period. Worst IGISIS 
symptom  intensity  scores  by  week  during  the  five-week  treatment  period  for  each  subject  will  be 
summarised by treatment groups and will be analysed using an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include treatment as factors, and adjusting for study parts, region (US and non-US), age 
and BMI. Additional covariates may also be included. 
Worst IGISIS individual symptom interference level: 
Worst IGISIS individual symptom interference level is defined as a subject’s worst symptom interference 
level  (No  symptom  <  Not  at  all  <  Slightly  <  Moderately  <  Quite  a  bit  <  Extremely)  for  a  particular 
symptom out of all completed IGISIS diaries during the treatment period. All five GI symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain and diarrhoea) will be reported separately and 
summarised by treatment groups. 
Sensitivity Analysis of IGISIS Endpoints: 
An evaluable diary is defined as an instance when a subject took study drug prior to completing the diary 
and completed the diary within the recommended reporting window (two to nine hours post dose). 
Assessment report

Summary statistics were presented for IGISIS primary and secondary endpoint by evaluable and non-
evaluable dairies. Event days will be analysed controlling for evaluable and non-evaluable dairies. 
The  primary  analysis  based  on  Part  A and  Part  B  data  is  not  acceptable  due  to  the  unblinded  interim 
analysis with a potential type-1 error inflation and the finalisation of the SAP after the interim analysis. 
The analysis of the pooled data could therefore be biased. Instead, Part B should be considered only. 
The main analysis (if based on Part B data), i.e., the use of a negative binomial model for the number 
of  days  with  any  symptom  intensity  score  ≥  2  using  the  log  number  of  exposure  days  as  an  offset 
parameter  is  acceptable  in  general.  However,  the  analysis  was  not  clearly  specified  with  respect  to 
potential additional covariates. In addition, it is not clear whether the envisaged conditional procedure 
where the use of the model depends on the outcome still maintains the type-1 error, although inflation 
may not be considerable. This may, however, not be considered as a relevant issue since the negative 
binomial model was finally used with the initially planned covariates.  
The applicant provided sensitivity analyses based on the proposed Poisson model with adjustment for 
overdispersion and the zero-inflated negative  binomial model  and these analyses showed comparable 
results with the primary analysis. 
Furthermore, as the covariates were not properly pre-specified in the SAP (and age was added as an 
additional covariate), the analysis cannot be considered as fully pre-specified. The applicant provided an 
analysis  without  the  factor  age  as  a  covariate  as  well  as  additional  sensitivity  analyses  with  added 
relevant baseline covariates. Despite that the analyses were not properly pre-specified the results from 
the provided additional sensitivity analyses were in line with the primary analysis.   
In the IGISIS scale, if a symptom was assessed as ongoing, it was only recorded in the initial intensity 
score.  Therefore,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  comment  on  which  of  the  analysed  parameters  of  the 
IGISIS scale allowed for the assessment of the severity of the side effects, which increased in intensity 
over time (A302). It was clarified that if an IGISIS symptom was recorded as ongoing, the intensity for 
an  ongoing  symptom  was  assumed  to  be  unchanged  and  the  initial  intensity  score  collected  at  the 
symptom start time/date was carried over until the symptom ended or symptom severity changed. An 
example was given by the applicant whereby a participant records an ongoing symptom of nausea in 
the morning diary with an intensity score of 3 and over the course of the day this nausea is worsened, 
then the participant is asked to end the previous nausea symptom and enter a new nausea symptom 
with a newly categorised intensity score (for example, 6). This procedure may not be a true reflection 
of the clinical condition of the patient. It does not truly represent the worsening or the deterioration of 
the symptom and may provide a false picture of the symptom, introducing a bias. The same applies to 
recording a lower intensity score for a symptom that improves. 
The  applicant  clarified  how  many  event  days  were  counted  when  a  patient  recorded  more  than  1 
symptoms in a day with a symptom score ≥ 2 and how many event days were counted in case a symptom 
ended in the afternoon and another symptom started. This case is counted as 1 event day, the same as 
in the case of one symptom having a score ≥ 2 in a day (Table 6).

questionnaire had a score of 0 and are not included in the table. 
b Symptom score ≥ 2 therefore counted as an ‘event day’. 
The main issue in the analysis, however, is based on the improper handling of missing evaluable diaries. 
For  a  considerable  number  of  days  the  diaries  were  not  evaluable  or  valid,  which  may  also  include 
completely  missing  diaries.  No  missing  data  imputation  was  neither  planned  nor  performed  for  these 
days.  Basically,  the  analysis  was  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  absence  of  a  valid  diary  (or 
evaluability  of  a  diary)  was  completely  at  random  and  the  actual  endpoint  refers  to  a  mixture  of  the 
presence of relevant symptoms (≥ 2) and the evaluability of the diary.  
Hence, the applicant was requested to justify the validity and robustness of the conclusions with respect 
to  the  large  number  of  non-evaluable  diaries  and  whether  the  actual  analysis  yields  an  unbiased 
estimation for the relative reduction in days with any symptom intensity score ≥ 2, if all diaries were 
evaluable.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  percentage  of  non-evaluable  diaries  was  balanced  between 
the  two  treatment  groups  (31%  for  DRF,  27%  for  DMF)  and  the  outcome  from  the  two  sensitivity 
analyses to assess the impact of the non-evaluable diaries did not appear to yield a biased estimation, 
which could have impacted the conclusions. However, the robustness of the analysis regarding the large 
amount of non-evaluable diaries still remains unclear since it still remains unclear whether reference-
based multiple imputation was performed appropriately. The applicant wrote that “five repetitions were 
obtained for analyses to show robustness of the missing imputation of the difference of treatment effect 
on the number of days with IGISIS symptom intensity score ≥ 2”. However, multiple imputation would 
require the combination of multiply imputed datasets applying Rubin’s rule. Hence, the results given by 
the applicant cannot be assessed properly.

The mean age of subjects was 43.7 years, with most subjects (64.7%) being ≥ 40 years of age. The 
majority  of  subjects  were  female  (72.8%),  White  (91.1%),  and  not  Hispanic  or  Latino  (97.0%). 
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  participating  in  this  study  were  enrolled  from  the  US  (55.2% 
[278/504]  of  subjects).  Mean  (SD)  BMI  was  27.4  (6.0)  kg/m2  (range:  17.1  to  54.3  kg/m2).  The 
demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups.

protocol deviations that did not allow them to be allocated to a treatment group). A very small number 
of  subjects  (n=2)  in  the  safety  population  who  did  not  have  at  least  one  postbaseline  GI  tolerability

There  were  four  major  protocol  deviations  for  Part  A  and  3  for  Part  B  who  did  not  meet  the 
exclusion/inclusion criteria. The applicant confirmed that the two subjects, who were not included in the 
Safety population, could not be allocated to a treatment group.  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Of the 506 randomised subjects, 504 received at least one dose of study treatment, 502 subjects were 
included in the FAS population (253 subjects in the DRF group and 249 subjects in the DMF group). 
Primary Endpoint 
The mean (SD) values of event days for observed diaries (i.e., all diaries collected, without imputation 
of any values) were 1.5 (2.85) days and 2.5 (4.68) days for the DRF and DMF groups, respectively. The 
rate  obtained  from  the  negative  binomial  regression  model  is  an  adjustment  to  the  mean  number  of 
event days after considering the subject’s exposure days and adjusting for study parts, region (US and 
non-US), age, and BMI. The rate (0.041) for the DRF group was lower than the rate (0.076) for the DMF 
group. The rate ratio was 0.542 (95% CI [0.390, 0.754]) with a corresponding p=0.0003, representing 
a relative reduction of 45.8% in the DRF group compared with the DMF group.

In addition, according to the applicant, Part B results were consistent with the pooled results and were 
similarly significant, including for the primary endpoint and for the originally proposed primary endpoint 
assessed in Part A (any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 3; p =0.012) before the unblinded 
interim analysis and subsequent revisions to the study endpoints. Although not all secondary endpoints 
for the study were statistically significant (e.g., the number of days with a GGISIS symptom intensity 
score ≥ 2 or ≥ 3), they were all directionally concordant with the overall findings in favour of DRF.

b Number of event days is analysed by a negative binomial regression model, with the logarithmic transformation of the number of 
exposure days as the “offset” parameter and treatment group as a factor and adjusting for study part, region (US and non-US), age, 
and BMI. DMF is used as a reference group. 
The ratio results have been adjusted to participant’s exposure days, study parts, region, age and BMI, 
but  this  adjustment  has  not  been  unambiguously  pre-specified  in  the  SAP  stating  that  “additional 
covariates may also be included” (actually, age was included as a covariate), see also the corresponding 
comment in the assessment of the statistical methods.  
Statistically significant differences have been demonstrated for the primary endpoint, Number of Days 
With  Any  IGISIS  Symptoms  Intensity  Score  ≥  2,  in  the  FAS  populations  for  the  pooled  Part  A  and  B 
(0.542, p = 0.0003) and for part B only (0.520, p = 0.0007). It is noted that Part B results (key secondary 
endpoint) were significant and consistent with the pooled results.  
With respect to the GI tolerability AEs, in study A302 Part A and B, overall GI adverse reactions were 
observed in 34.8% of DRF-treated patients and in 49.0% of DMF-treated patients. Slightly more subjects 
on DMF discontinued due to TEAEs as compared with subjects on DRF (6% vs. 1.6%). However, and in 
order to put the percentages in a numerical perspective, four subjects on ALKS-8700 (DRF) discontinued 
the study due to adverse events and 15 subjects in the DMF group. From these discontinuations, 0.8% 
in ALKS-8700 (DRF) were due to GI disorders, whilst in the case of DMF group these were 4.8%. Out of 
these, one subject on ALKS-8700 (DRF) discontinued due to diarrhoea and one due to vomiting. In the 
case of DMF five subjects discontinued due to upper abdominal pain, three due to diarrhoea, three due 
to abdominal pain, two due to vomiting, one due to abdominal distention, one due to gastrointestinal 
pain and one due to nausea. An analysis for the discontinuations in Part B alone could have provided 
additional information, but the numbers are very low to allow any meaningful conclusions. 
The specificity was moderate (59%). Furthermore, when the number of days with any IGISIS score ≥ 4, 
≥ 5,  ≥ 6  were  evaluated  the  numbers  were  below  unit  1  in  both  groups  ALKS-8700  (DRF)  and  DMF 
showing that the numbers are very low to draw any clinically meaningful conclusions and questioning 
the clinical usefulness of these scales.

Finally, the mechanism for better DRF GI tolerance is unclear. Both DMF and DRF undergo pre-systemic 
hydrolysis  with  an  identical  active  metabolite  (MMF).  According  to  the  applicant's  declarations,  the 
primary  metabolite  of  DRF,  HES  is  inactive.  Therefore,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  justify  what 
mechanism lies behind the better tolerance of DRF.  
The applicant presented a discussion of the probable basis for the better tolerability of DRF relative to 
DMF. Among the likely reasons for better gastrointestinal-related tolerance were the lower concentration 
of methanol formed, the larger particle size of DRF limiting binding to receptors within the gastrointestinal 
tract, and the lower electrophilicity of DRF. Nevertheless, all of the reasons raised by the applicant are 
considered  speculative.  There  is  no  evidence  to  support  that  any  of  the  presented  mechanisms  are 
important in the hypothesised better tolerance of DRF. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The assessment of the secondary endpoints provided either statistically significant results (differences 
of  the  worst  overall  intensity  scores  during  the  five-week  treatment  period  in  Parts  A  and  B  for  the 
individual symptoms of nausea, vomiting and upper abdominal pain, IGISIS Intensity Score ≥ 1 in the 
Overall  Population,  IGISIS  Intensity  Score  ≥  3  in  the  Overall  Population  and  Number  of  Days  With  a 
GGISIS  Symptom  Intensity  Score  ≥  1)  or  a  trend  in  favour  of  DRF  (number  of  days  with  a  GGISIS 
Symptom Intensity Score of ≥ 2 and number of days with a GGISIS Symptom Intensity Score of ≥ 3). 
It  is  noted  that  the  rate  of  discontinuations  in  the  DMF  group  was  consistent  with  what  has  been 
previously  reported  for  DMF  i.e.  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  leading  to 
discontinuation  (incidence  >1%)  in  subjects  treated  with  Tecfidera  were  flushing  (3%)  and 
gastrointestinal events (4%) [Tecfidera SmPC 2020]. This is indicative of the consistency of the results 
obtained up to now. 
A  useful  secondary  endpoint  was  the  Worst  IGISIS  Individual  Symptom  Intensity  Score  during  the 
five-Week  Treatment  Period.  From  the  individual  efficacy  response  data  listing  it  appears  that  only  a 
limited number of participants reported intensity scores of 7 (n=7), 8 (n=9), 9 (n=4) and 10 (n=12). 
The worst score 10 in most of the cases was used for diarrhoea followed by abdominal pain. This is also 
confirmed by the applicant’s analysis in which the symptom with the mean highest intensity score was 
diarrhoea (1.1 for DRF and 1.3 for DMF). 
The limited number of patients reporting intensity scores ≥ 7 could be reassuring that subjects were not 
suffering to the degree that they could not report their symptoms and scores in their e-Diaries. From 
this it can be assumed that any missing values were unlikely to be due to a symptom and its respective 
high intensity e.g., diarrhoea 10.  
Exploratory and other endpoints 
In the case  of the exploratory and other endpoints, which were typical MS  relevant endpoints, it was 
anticipated  that  no  meaningful  differences  could  be  observed  between  the  two  treatments,  DMF  and 
DRF, due to the short duration of the study. However, it is noted that the two treatments (despite the 
short duration of 12 weeks) behaved similarly i.e. EDSS (mean and median), T25-FW, SF-12, EQ-5D-5L 
scores at baseline and their change from baseline were similar between ALKS 8700 (DRF) and DMF. 
•  Ancillary analyses (A302) 
The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint [number of evaluable days with any IGISIS symptom 
intensity score ≥ 2 (FAS Population, Parts A and B)] corroborated the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint  and  showed  statistically  significant  differentiation  between  treatment  groups.  Statistical 
significance  was  greater  using  evaluable  days  (p<  0.0001  and  rate  ratio  0.486)  compared  to  the 
non-evaluable  days  analysis,  which  also  demonstrated  statistical  significance,  p  =  0.0479  (rate  ratio 
0.640). Both analyses showed statistically significant differentiation.

The sensitivity analysis performed for the secondary endpoint [number of evaluable days with any IGISIS 
symptom  intensity  score  ≥  2  (FAS  Population,  Part  B)]  corroborated  the  primary  analysis  of  this 
secondary endpoint. The rate ratio for the number of evaluable days (0.462) was statistically significant 
(p = 0.0005), but the rate ratio (0.630) for the number of non-evaluable days was not (p = 0.0963).  
Study A301 (EVOLVE-MS-1) 
A Phase 3 multicentre open label study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ALKS-8700 
in adults with RRMS. 
Methods (A301) 
In this ongoing OL study, ALKS-8700 was administered up to 96 weeks for the treatment of RRMS.  
Subjects entered the study in one of two ways: 
1. De Novo Subjects: those who had not participated in any prior study of ALKS-8700. 
2. Rollover Subjects: those who had completed the Treatment Period of Study ALK8700-A302.  
For  De  Novo  subjects,  the  study  duration  was  up  to  102  weeks,  which  included  up  to  4  weeks  for 
screening, a 96-week open-label treatment period, and a two-week follow-up period. 
Figure 4: Study A301 design schematic  
* Lymphocyte monitoring follow up visits (maximum 3 visits within 6 months) may be required after this visit.  
•  Study Participants (A301) 
The target population for this study was adults, aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosed with RRMS.  
Approximately  1000  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  who  were  to  be  administered 
ALKS-8700. A sample size of ≥ 1000 subjects meets the ICH guidance on the extent of subject exposures 
required  to  assess  clinical  safety  for  a  new  study  drug.  A  total of  1057  subjects  were  enrolled  in  this 
study. 593 were de novo subjects who received ALKS-8700 and 464 were Rollover subjects from Study 
ALK-8700 A302 (239 subjects had previously been treated with ALKS-8700 (DRF), and 225 subjects had 
previously been treated with dimethyl fumarate [DMF]).

Study  treatment  included  ALKS-8700  231  mg  administered  as  one  capsule  and  ALKS-8700  462  mg 
administered  as  two  231  mg  capsules.  At  Visit  2  (Day  1),  all  eligible  participants  began  open-label 
treatment. 
Capsules were administered orally BID. Study staff administered the first dose of ALKS-8700 at Visit 2 
(Day 1). From that point on during the Treatment Period, the staff dispensed ALKS-8700 for subjects’ 
self-administration.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  take  study  treatment  with  or  without  food.  However, 
subjects  were  instructed  to  avoid  taking  study  treatment  with  a  high-fat,  high-calorie  meal.  Detailed 
dosing instructions were provided to the subjects by the site personnel. 
There were 18 batches of ALKS-8700 used in this study.

PK  samples  were  collected  from  a  subset  of  de  novo  subjects  (n  =  44).  The  PK  parameters 
calculated included, but were not limited to, the following: Cmax, tmax, and AUClast. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking) (A301) 
There was no randomisation. This was an OL single arm study, still ongoing. 
•  Statistical methods (A301) 
Complete details of the planned statistical analyses performed for this interim report are documented in 
the SAP, which was developed and finalised prior to database lock. An overview of analysis populations, 
summary strategies, and any amendments to the proposed analyses is provided in this document. 
In general, summary statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, 
and number and percentage of participants in each category for categorical variables) were provided by 
enrolment group. All summary tables were based on observed data, and missing values were not imputed 
unless otherwise indicated. Measurements collected from unscheduled visits were not included in the by-
visit summary tables or figures but were included in the analyses for the PCS postbaseline values and 
participant listings, with the exception of lymphocyte counts. 
The following study populations were analysed: 
o  Safety population: included all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. 
The Safety population was used in the safety analyses. 
o  Efficacy population: included data from the FAS, defined as all subjects who received at least 
one dose of ALKS 8700 in Study ALK-8700A301 and have had at least one post-baseline efficacy 
assessment of any of the efficacy endpoints, including MRI endpoints, T25-FW, EDSS, SF-12, 
and EQ-5D-5L. The FAS was the efficacy population and was used in the efficacy analyses. 
o  PK population: included a subset of subjects enrolled at selected sites who received ALKS-8700 
and had at least one measurable concentration of MMF at any scheduled PK time point. 
Descriptive statistics are considered acceptable due to the OL nature of the study. 
Results (A301) 
•  Subject disposition (A301) 
As of the data cut-off date of 02 Feb 2020, 1057 subjects entered this study: 593 were de novo subjects 
and 239 were Rollover subjects from DRF from Study A302 and 225 were Rollover subjects from DMF 
from Study A302. All subjects received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the Safety 
population. A total of 1041 subjects had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment of any efficacy 
endpoint and were included in the FAS population.  
•  Recruitment  
The study was to be conducted at approximately 125 sites in North America and Europe.

There  were  two  amendments  that  introduced  no  major  changes.  There  were  no  changes  in  planned 
analyses from the protocol.  
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were reported for a total of 255 /1057 subjects as of the data cut-off date for 
this interim report (02 Feb 2020). According to the applicant, the protocol deviations were not considered 
to have a significant impact on the study results or the overall analysis of the data. 
•  Baseline data (A301) 
Overall,  the  mean  (SD)  age  of  subjects  was  42.5  (10.78)  years  of  age,  with  a  higher  proportion  of 
subjects being ≥ 40 years of age (59.6% [630/1057] of subjects). Overall, most of the subjects were 
female  (72.1%  [762/1057]  of  subjects),  white  (92.0%  [972/1057]  of  subjects),  and  not  Hispanic  or 
Latino (96.2% [1017/1057] of subjects). A higher proportion of participants in this study were enrolled 
from  non-US  regions  (57.1%  [604/1057]  of  subjects).  Mean  (SD)  BMI  was  26.6  (6.1)  kg/m2  (range 
14.2 to 55.8 kg/m2).  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across the three groups, with the exception 
of the region where they were enrolled. The majority of de novo subjects were enrolled from non-US 
regions (64.9% [385/593] of subjects), while the rollover subjects were equally distributed in the two 
regions, with 48.1% (115/239) subjects and 51.9% (124/239) subjects enrolled in the non-US and US 
regions,  respectively  in  the  ALKS-8700  Rollover  group,  and  46.2%  (104/225)  of  subjects  and  53.8% 
(121/225) of subjects enrolled in the non-US and US regions, respectively in the DMF rollover group.  
•  Numbers analysed (A301) 
Of the total 1057 subjects enrolled in the study, 98.5% (1041/1057) of subjects were included in the 
FAS population. Efficacy endpoints were considered exploratory because of the OL and single-arm design 
of this study. PK samples were collected in a subset of 44 de novo participants at selected sites. A site 
mistakenly took a PK sample from a subject in the ALKS-8700 Rollover group at Visit 3, and the sample 
was analysed with measurable MMF, so by definition, this subject was included in the PK population. 
•  Outcomes and estimation (A301) 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Endpoints (A301) 
Number of GdE Lesions 
At  Week  96,  the  GdE  lesion  count  was  captured  for  606  subjects  (474  subjects  65  subjects,  and  67 
subjects in the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group, respectively). 
A mean decrease in the GdE lesion count was reported in all three groups at Week 96. 
The  mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline  in  the  GdE  lesions  count  for  the  d  novo  group,  the  ALKS-8700 
Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group was -0.85 (4.726), -0.49 (1.264), and -0.97 (2.674) lesions, 
respectively, which equates to 64.4%, 80.3%, and 80.2% decrease from baseline, respectively. Overall, 
there was an increase in the proportion of participants with 0 GdE lesions (20.7%) from baseline to Week 
96  as  well  as  decreases  in  the  proportions  of  participants  with  1  to  4,  5  to  8,  and  ≥  9  GdE  lesions  (-
14.7%,  -3.8%,  and  -1.9%,  respectively)  from  baseline  to  Week  96.  Across  the  3  groups,  a  high 
proportion of subjects (> 90%) had 0 GdE lesions at Week 96. 
Number of New or Enlarging T2 lesions 
New or enlarging T2 lesions from Week 48 to Week 96 were assessed for 607 subjects (475 subjects, 
65 subjects, and 67 subjects in the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover 
group, respectively). The mean (SD) number of new or enlarging T2 lesions that developed from Week 
Assessment report

48 to Week 96 for the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group was 
1.60 (6.636), 0.75 (3.881), and 0.72 (2.295) lesions, respectively. 
Total T2 Lesion Volume 
At Week 96, the total T2 lesion volume was evaluable for 607 subjects (475 subjects, 65 subjects, and 
67  subjects  in  the  de  novo  group,  the  ALKS-8700  Rollover  group,  and  the  DMF  Rollover  group, 
respectively).  The  mean  (SD)  percent  change  from  baseline  in  total  T2  lesion  volume  in  the  de  novo 
group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group was 1.26% (16.4%), 0.93% (13.4%), 
and 0.27% (14.6%), respectively. 
Number of New T1 Hypointense Lesions 
The number of new T1 hypointense lesions from baseline to Week 96 was evaluable for 606 subjects 
(474 subjects, 65 subjects, and 67 subjects in the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and 
the DMF Rollover group, respectively). The mean (SD) number of new T1 hypointense lesions from Week 
48 to Week 96 in the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group was 
0.83 (4.0), 0.23 (1.2), and 0.73 (5.0) lesions, respectively.  
Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) 
The PBVC from baseline to Week 96 was evaluable for 456 participants (369 subjects, 42 subjects, and 
45  subjects  in  the  de  novo  group,  the  ALKS-8700  Rollover  group,  and  the  DMF  Rollover  group, 
respectively).  The  mean  (SD)  PBVC  from  baseline  to  Week  96  in  the  de  novo  group,  the  ALKS-8700 
Rollover  group,  and  the  DMF  Rollover  group  was  -0.71%  (0.76%),  -0.86%  (0.81%),  and  -0.73% 
(0.74%), respectively, and the median PBVC value was -0.63%, -0.93%, and -0.80%, respectively, for 
the three groups. 
Clinical Endpoints (A301) 
Proportion of Participants with a Multiple Sclerosis Relapse 
During the course of the study up to the interim data cutoff (07 February 2020), overall, the majority of 
p subjects (84.5% [893/1057]) did not experience a protocol-defined relapse during the course of the 
study.  A  total  of  15.5%  (164/1057)  of  subjects  experienced  between  1  and  ≥ 4  protocol-defined 
relapses,  with  12.0%  (127/1057),  2.7%  (29/1057),  0.6%  (6/1057),  and  0.2%  (2/1057)  of  subjects 
experiencing 1, 2, 3, and ≥ 4 relapses, respectively. 
Annualised Relapse Rate 
The ARR based on protocol-defined relapses was assessed using the Safety population (N = 1057). 
The ARR for the overall Safety population was 0.14, with similar ARR values across the treatment groups. 
The mean (SD) of ARR calculated at participant level was 0.16 (0.543). 
EDSS score 
The mean EDSS score calculated at baseline was similar across the groups. In the FAS population, the 
mean (SD) EDSS score in the de novo group, the ALKS 8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group 
was 2.71 (1.457), 2.64 (1.481), and 2.71 (1.445), respectively. 
Proportion of Participants Experiencing Progression of Disability 
The proportion of subjects with confirmed disability progression sustained for 12 weeks was low in all 
groups, with 8.1% (47/582) of subjects in the De Novo group and 7.2% (17/235) and 8.9% (20/224) 
participants in the ALKS-8700 and DMF Rollover groups, respectively experiencing confirmed disability 
progression.

No Evidence of Disease Activity 
At Week 96, 663 of 1057 participants were evaluable for NEDA-3. Overall, 23.4% (155/663) of subjects 
achieved NEDA-3 at Week 96, with a slightly higher proportion of subjects achieving NEDA-3 at Week 
96 in the de novo group (24.9% [121/486] of subjects) than in the Rollover groups (20.5% [18/88] of 
participants and 18.0% [16/89] of subjects in the ALKS-8700 Rollover group and the DMF Rollover group, 
respectively). 
Timed 25-Foot Walk 
The applicant has calculated the T25-FW scores at baseline, and these were similar across the groups. 
The mean (SD) values were 7.104 seconds (4.730 seconds), 6.697 seconds (4.926 seconds), and 6.635 
seconds (3.618 seconds) for the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover 
group, respectively. 
The results, albeit from an open label and single arm study, without a comparator group can provide 
only a long-term view for the progress timeline of patients’ condition, especially in the case of the MRI 
data. The efficacy data cannot be considered confirmatory, but only provide supportive data of a similar 
efficacy  profile  in  comparison  to  what  is  known  for  DMF.  External  comparisons  are  not  usually 
appropriate.  These  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  They  can,  however,  play  the  role  of 
supportive indicators for the effect of a treatment. In such a case, the results with MS relevant efficacy 
measurements are in favour of an effect for DRF. 
PROs followed a similar trend to that of the results of the clinical outcomes and showed stability, slowing 
disease activity or minor decreases in mental components as well as other quality of life components.

Study 109MS301 (DEFINE) 
Study 109MS301 was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of DMF in subjects with RRMS. The 
study  was  a  Randomized,  Multicentre,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Dose-Comparison  Study. 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive DMF 240 mg BID, DMF 240 mg TID, or placebo.  
Study Participants (109MS301) 
1011 subjects were planned, 1237 subjects were randomised, and 1234 subjects were dosed. The intent-
to-treat  and  safety  populations  comprised  the  1234  randomised  and  dosed  subjects.  The  MRI  cohort 
included  approximately  95%  of  all  subjects  enrolled  at  investigational  sites  whose  MRI  capability  was 
validated  by  the  MRI  reading  centre  (540  subjects).  The  per-protocol  population  comprised  subjects 
without major protocol violations (1090 subjects).

Summary of the Results (109MS301) 
A summary of key efficacy results for Study 109MS301 is presented in Table 4. Treatment with DMF, 
administered  as  240  mg  BID  or  TID,  significantly  reduced  clinical  exacerbations  over  the  2-year 
treatment  period,  as  assessed  using  a  variety  of  definitions  (the  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed,  the 
time to relapse, and the ARR) as well as the risk of confirmed (12-week) disability progression at 2 years 
as measured by EDSS scores. As shown by Kaplan-Meier analyses of relapse and disability, the treatment 
effect  was  sustained  throughout  the  treatment  period,  with  the  placebo  and  nearly  overlapping  DMF 
curves appearing to continue to diverge up to the final time point. Across a variety of subgroups defined 
by demographic and MS disease characteristics, DMF demonstrated a benefit on these clinical measures 
that  was  generally  consistent,  although  a  pattern  of  greater  benefit  was  seen  in  subjects  who  were 
younger than 40 years of age, were MS treatment naïve, or had a baseline EDSS score of 2.0 or lower. 
A positive effect on the rate of relapses requiring intravenous steroids and of MS-related hospitalisations 
was  also  seen  with  DMF  treatment.  The  effect  on  disability  progression  (EDSS)  was  supported  by 
significant improvement on the multiple sclerosis functional composite score. 
Significant  improvement  in  cognition,  as  measured  by  changes  in  the  PASAT-3  component,  was  also 
observed. 
GdE and new/enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion activity was substantially and significantly suppressed by 
DMF  treatment,  with  robust  effects  apparent  as  early  as  six  months  and  maintained  throughout  the 
treatment period. 
Statistically significant increases in magnetisation transfer ratio in normal-appearing brain tissue and in 
whole brain (presumably reflecting increased myelin and axonal content) were seen with both DMF doses, 
whereas decreased MTR was seen with placebo. 
In this study, 109MS301, the estimated proportion of participants with 24-week confirmed progression 
at two years was 0.169 for placebo, 0.128 for BID, and 0.119 for TID (23% reduction for BID and 31% 
reduction for TID relative to placebo; p = 0.1893 and 0.0760, respectively).  
Study 109MS302 (CONFIRM) 
Study  109MS302  was  a  pivotal  Phase  3  Randomized,  Multicentre,  Placebo-Controlled,  double-blind, 
rater-blind  and  Active  Reference  (Glatiramer  Acetate)  Comparison  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and 
Safety of BG00012 in Subjects With RRMS. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive DMF 
240 mg BID, DMF 240 mg TID, GA, or placebo.  
Study Participants (109MS302) 
A total of 1232 subjects were planned, 1430 subjects were randomised, and 1417 subjects were dosed. 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  and  safety  populations  comprised  the  1417  randomised  and  dosed  subjects. 
The MRI cohort included 681 subjects (167, 169, 170, and 175 subjects in the placebo, BG00012 BID, 
BG00012 TID, and GA groups, respectively) enrolled at investigational sites whose MRI capability was 
validated  by  the  MRI  reading  centre.  The  per-protocol  population  comprised  subjects  without  major 
protocol violations (1323 subjects). 
Summary of the Results (109MS302) 
A summary of the key efficacy results for Study 109MS302 is presented in Table 4 Treatment with DMF, 
administered  as  240  mg  BID  or  TID,  significantly  reduced  clinical  exacerbations  over  the  two-year 
treatment period, as assessed by the ARR, the proportion of subjects relapsed, and the time to relapse.

The significant effect on the rate of relapses requiring intravenous steroid therapy and a trend toward 
fewer MS-related hospitalisations in the DMF groups are supportive of the beneficial clinical effects of 
DMF  treatment  in  subjects  with  RRMS.  As  shown  by  Kaplan-Meier  analyses  of  relapse,  the  treatment 
effect  was  first  apparent  between  three  to  six  months  and  was  sustained  throughout  the  two-year 
treatment period, with the placebo and DMF curves appearing to continue to diverge up to the final time 
point. 
Treatment  with  DMF  BID  and  TID  produced  clinically  meaningful  reductions  of  21%  and  24%, 
respectively, over placebo in 12-week confirmed disability progression. A more obvious separation was 
seen  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  more  rigorous  24-week  confirmed  disability  progression,  with 
reductions  of  38%  and  33%  compared  with  placebo.  While  a  lower  than  estimated  proportion  of 
participants with 12-week confirmed disability in the placebo group contributed to the lack of statistical 
significance for this endpoint, the change in EDSS scores lends further support for the beneficial effect 
of DMF treatment on disability progression. 
The  efficacy  of  DMF  in  reducing  disability  progression  was  also  supported  by  improved  functioning  as 
measured by the MSFC and significant participant-reported improvement in overall physical health and 
functioning (SF-36 PCS) and overall impressions of general well-being (VAS). 
In this study, 109MS302, the estimated proportion of subjects with 24-week confirmed progression at 
two years was 0.125 for placebo, 0.078 for BID, and 0.086 for TID (38% reduction for BID and 33% 
reduction for TID relative to placebo; p = 0.0630 and 0.1172, respectively). 
Study C-1900 
A phase 2, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, DB, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, which 
provided dose-response data and supported the continued development of the DMF 240 mg TID dose. 
The sample size for this study was 257 randomised subjects.  
Methods (C-1900) 
Study  C-1900  was  composed  of  2  parts:  a  24-week,  DB,  placebo-controlled,  safety  and  efficacy 
treatment phase (Part 1) followed by a 24-week, DB, safety extension phase (Part 2). In Part 1, subjects 
were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three doses of DMF (120 mg QD, 120 mg TID, or 
240  mg  TID)  or  matching  placebo  for  24 weeks.  In  Part  2,  subjects  who  received  placebo  in  Part  1 
switched to DMF 240 mg TID; the remaining subjects continued their same DMF dosing regimen. The 
primary endpoint was the total number of new GdE lesions at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (calculated as 
the  sum  of  the  new  GdE  lesions  seen  on  the  four  MRI  scans).  Subjects  who  either  prematurely 
discontinued study treatment at any time during the study or completed Part 1 but did not continue to 
Part 2 had a follow-up visit approximately four weeks after the last dose. 
Study Participants (C-1900) 
Approximately 260 subjects were planned; 257 subjects were enrolled, and 256 received at least 1 dose 
of study drug and were analysed. 
Results (C-1900) 
In this study, a dose-related effect on MRI markers of RRMS activity was observed with evidence that 
treatment  with  BG00012  (DMF)  resulted  in  fewer  inflammatory  brain  lesions,  changes  that  were 
statistically significant in the 240 mg TID group versus placebo.

Results from the pivotal Phase 3 studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 demonstrated that the dose 240 mg 
BID  of DMF consistently  provided  significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  in  both  clinical  and 
MRI  outcome  measures  and  showed  increased  efficacy  compared  with  an  approved  first-line  therapy, 
GA, in participants with RRMS. In addition, the Study 109MS303 confirmed the maintained treatment 
effect of DMF 240 mg BID with low relapse rates and confirmed disability progression for up to 12 years 
of treatment. 
Based upon the similar exposure levels of MMF, after oral dosing of DRF 462 mg and DMF 240 mg, the 
assessment of efficacy for DRF could rely on the DMF clinical study programme. 
Study 109MS303 (ENDORSE) 
Study  109MS303  was  the  OL  extension  study  of  the  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  (Studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302) and was ongoing at the time of the submission of the Tecfidera MAA. Interim efficacy results 
through 03 August 2011 were provided with the Tecfidera MAA. The final results have been submitted 
with this MAA for DRF. 
This  study  is  currently  being  evaluated  in  a  type  II  variation  procedure  for  Tecfidera

Methods (109MS303) 
This study is a multicentre, randomised, dose blind, parallel group, five-year extension study evaluating 
the long-term efficacy and safety of BG00012 (DMF) 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID administered orally 
in  subjects  with  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis.  A  total  of  2079  subjects  completed  the  parent 
studies, Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. Of these 1738 subjects (84%) were enrolled in the extension 
study,  all  of  them  were  enrolled  in  the  dose-blind  first  phase  of  the  extension  study.  A  total  of  1736

subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment.  Of  the  1736  subjects  in  Study  109MS303, 
approximately half (909 subjects, 52%) were treated for six years or longer. 
Treatments (109MS303) 
Eligible participants from Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 were enrolled in this extension study and 
followed for at least 8 years. The first phase of this study was a parallel group, randomised, dose-blind, 
dose-comparison study, and the second phase was OL. 
A total of 2079 patients completed the parent studies, Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. Of these 1738 
patients (84%) were enrolled in the  extension study, all of them were enrolled in the  dose-blind first 
phase of the extension study.  A total of 1736 patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment.  
Of the 1736 subjects in Study 109MS303, approximately half (909 subjects, 52%) were treated for 6 
years or longer. Across all three studies, 501 subjects were continuously treated with DMF 240 mg BID 
and 249 subjects who were previously treated with placebo in Studies 109MS301 or 109MS302 received 
treatment with DMF 240 mg BID in Study 109MS303. Subjects who received treatment with DMF 240 
mg BID continuously were treated for up to 12 years. 
Results (109MS303) 
Clinical Measures 
ARR 
During the overall 109MS303 study period, the majority of subjects (between 59% and 69%) had no 
relapses. In the first year of Study 109MS303, the adjusted ARR (95% CI) ranged from 0.125 (0.084, 
0.188) to 0.183 (0.108, 0.308), and in the eighth year of Study 109MS303, it remained low and ranged 
from  0.077  (0.039,  0.153)  to  0.129  (0.063,  0.265).  There  was  no  evidence  of  diminished  efficacy  in 
reduction of ARR after an additional year (a total of three years) of dosing. During the overall 109MS303 
study period, the adjusted ARR (95% CI) ranged from 0.126 (0.098, 0.162) to 0.185 (0.129, 0.265). 
Over years 0 through 9 of Study 109MS303, the adjusted ARR (95% CI) of relapses requiring intravenous 
steroid treatment ranged from 0.108 (0.082, 0.143) to 0.154 (0.103, 0.229) across treatment groups. 
Protocol-defined objective relapses were analysed excluding data from patients after they switched to 
alternative MS medications. During Study 109MS303, more than half of all subjects treated with DMF 
240 mg BID did not have a relapse (BID/BID, 60% and placebo/BID, 66%). 752 subjects were included 
in an MRI cohort. Final results in MRI assessments from this extension study showed that the majority 
of participants within the MRI cohort had no GdE lesions and the number of GdE lesions remained low. 
The relapse rate in participants treated with DMF was low and remained steady throughout the study 
period (Studies 109MS301, 109MS302, and 109MS303 combined).  
Figure 5 summarises the adjusted ARR for the 2 treatment groups, DMF 240 mg BID and DMF 240 mg 
TID  by  yearly  interval  during  Studies  109MS301,  109MS302,  and  109MS303.  The  TID  group  in 
Studies109MS301 and 109MS302 was on DMF 240 mg TID until 2014 and subsequently switched to DMF 
240 mg BID. 
In an integrated analysis of Studies 109MS301, 109MS302, and 109MS303, for subjects continuously 
treated with DMF BID/BID (n = 501; subjects treated with DMF 240 mg twice a day in Studies 109MS301 
or 109MS302 and then DMF 240 mg BID in Study 109MS303), the adjusted ARR was 0.187 (95% CI, 
0.156,  0.224)  in  Studies  109MS301  and  109MS302  and  was  0.141  (95%  CI,  0.119,  0.167)  in  Study

109MS303. The data in  Figure 5  demonstrate that  the adjusted ARR in participants treated with DMF 
was low and remained stable throughout the entire treatment period in Studies 109MS301 or 109MS302 
and  Study  109MS303  for  subjects  receiving  BID  continuously.  For  placebo/BID  subjects  (n  =  249; 
subjects treated with placebo in Studies 109MS301 or 109MS302 and then switched to DMF 240 mg BID 
in Study 109MS303), adjusted ARR was 0.330 (95% CI, 0.266, 0.408) and decreased after initiation of 
DMF, in Study 109MS303, to 0.149 (95% CI, 0.116, 0.190), as shown in Figure 5.  
Overall, the results of the updated and final long-term data of Study 109MS303 suggest maintenance of 
effect of DMF in adult subjects with RRMS. Efficacy findings are generally in line with the findings of the 
controlled parent studies as well as the preliminary results of the long-term extension study.  
Efficacy data in patients who discontinued study drug can be considered sufficient to evaluate a possible 
rebound effect. Taking into consideration that the Study 109MS303 duration was at least eight years, 
the reported level of discontinuations from the extension study (56%) appears to be at an acceptable 
level and the reported frequency of discontinuation reasons of study treatment due to MS relapse and 
disease progression of around 2% is low. 
Although, OL extension data should generally be interpreted with caution with regard to efficacy due to 
potential  methodological  issues,  the  updated  and  final  long-term  efficacy  results  of  Study  109MS303 
support the conclusion that the effect of DMF is maintained in adult patients with RRMS.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No comparisons or analyses were performed to compare the efficacy of DRF in different subpopulations. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of DMF has not yet been established in paediatric subjects. 
Study 109MS202 
DMF was evaluated in a prospective open-label, uncontrolled Study 109MS202 (FOCUS) in 22 paediatric 
subjects with RRMS aged 13 to 17 years (4 subjects ≤ 14 years). Subjects received DMF 120 mg BID 
for 7 days followed by DMF 240 mg BID for 24 weeks. 
Study 109MS311 
This study was a multicentre, open-label, extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy 
of  DMF  in  paediatric  subjects  with  RRMS.  Subjects  from  Study  109MS202  subsequently  entered  an 
extension Study 109MS311 (CONNECTED) for a further 96 weeks. 
Study 109MS306 
The safety and efficacy of DMF in children aged 10 to ≤ 18 years is being evaluated in Study 109MS306 
(CONNECT),  an  open-label,  randomised,  active-controlled  study.  Part  1  is  included  in  the  Tecfidera 
Paediatric  Investigation  Plan.  The  study  has  enrolled  156  subjects,  and  Part  1  was  completed  12 
November 2020. 
It should be noted that there are no product-specific data for DRF in the paediatric population. So far, 
there are limited data for DMF in the paediatric population in a total of 34 subjects, aged 13 to18 years 
old  (Studies  109MS202  and  its  extension  Study 109MS311).  These  limited  data  collected  after 
administration of DMF are not considered useful information to be included in the SmPC of DRF.

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Not applicable. 
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In  addition  to  presenting  the  results  from  the  individual  pivotal  Phase  3  Studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302,  the  results  from  an  integrated  analysis  of  the  two  studies  could  allow  for  a  more  precise 
estimate of the treatment effect of DMF vs. placebo. Pooling of data from the two studies is considered 
achievable, according to the applicant, because of the similarity in study design, randomisation ratios, 
and patient populations as follows: 
-  Both  studies  were  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  studies  with  an  equal 
randomisation ratio to each treatment group. 
-  Both  studies  included  the  same  dose  regimens  of  DMF,  and  both  included  a  DMF-matching 
placebo control group. 
- 
In both studies, the same efficacy endpoints were assessed at the same time-points. 
-  Both studies provided consistent criteria and definitions of protocol-defined clinical relapses and 
disease  progression.  In  both  studies,  the  same  INEC  members  were  involved  in  confirming 
clinical relapses. 
-  Both  studies  included  a  similar  patient  population  as  reflected  by  key  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria and more importantly, as demonstrated by the similar demographic and baseline disease 
characteristics  of  the  recruited  populations.  The  countries  from  which  the  participants  were 
recruited  were  mostly  the  same,  although  the  accrual  patterns  across  regions  were  different 
between studies. 
The pooled data provide an integrated assessment of the overall efficacy of DMF relative to placebo, as 
well  as  an  assessment  of  efficacy  in  subgroups  of  participants.  Demographics  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics  for  each  study  were  reviewed  for  consistency  between  studies  before  the  integrated 
analysis.  The  individual  study  results  (treatment  effects)  for  the  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary 
endpoints  were  also  reviewed  for  consistency  before  the  integrated  analyses  were  performed.  The 
applicant  clarified  that,  if the  treatment  effects  for a  particular  endpoint  were  not  consistent  between 
studies, the pooled analysis for that endpoint was not performed. 
• 
Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 efficacy endpoints  
Both  acute  clinical  relapses  and  accumulated  neurological  deficits,  which  result  in  increased  disability 
over  time,  significantly  impair  the  quality  of  life  of  MS  subjects.  The  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary 
endpoints (clinical and radiological measures) and their respective analyses were similar in both studies 
(109MS301  and  109MS302)  and  this  allowed  integrated  analyses  of  the  pooled  results  from  these 
studies.

2.6.5.6.  Supportive studies 
The Phase  1 studies can  be considered supportive for the dose selection for  the Phase 3  studies with 
DRF. The four studies performed with Tecfidera (DMF) C-1900, 109MS301, 109MS302 and 109MS303 
provide relevant efficacy data for the active moiety MMF subsequently to the administration of DMF. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The  applicant  has  already  clarified  that  no  formal  efficacy  studies  using  typical  MS  disease  endpoints 
with  DRF  have  been  completed  or  are  ongoing.  Their  development  strategy  was  based  upon  the 
bioequivalent exposure levels of MMF after oral dosing of DRF 462 mg and DMF 240 mg and a PK bridging 
approach between DRF and DMF.   
The  clinical  programme  for  DRF  includes  ten  completed  Phase  1  studies  and  one  completed  and  one 
ongoing Phase 3 studies. 
The assessment of efficacy for DRF relied on the DMF clinical study programme which consists of one 
Phase 2 placebo-controlled study (Study C-1900), two Phase 3 studies, one placebo controlled (Study 
109MS301)  and  one  placebo  and  active  controlled  (Study 109MS302)  and  the  final  results  from  the 
extension Study (109MS303) of the two Phase 3 studies. All studies included RRMS patients.  
ALK8700-8700 (DRF) clinical efficacy data 
Study A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2) 
A Phase 3, DB randomised multicentre study evaluated the comparative GI tolerability of DRF and DMF 
in adult subjects with RRMS (Study A302 [EVOLVE-MS2]). This study was conducted with adaptive design 
in two parts (Parts A and B). Parts A and B were identical in study design and included a 5-week, double-
blind  treatment  period  with  two  blind  treatment  arms  (DRF  and  DMF).  120  eligible  subjects  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021

randomised to one of the two treatment groups in Part A (n = 60 per group). Following completion of 
Part A, the applicant conducted a planned, unblinded exploratory analysis of the Part A GI tolerability 
and safety data to inform the endpoint selection for the overall study. The number of subjects in Part B 
were 386 (194 in the ALKS 8700 group and 192 in the DMF group). 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to DRF 462 mg BID, taken orally and DMF 240 mg BID, taken 
orally (both treatments had a 1-week titration). 
GI tolerability was determined using IGISIS and GGISIS. A number of secondary, exploratory and other 
endpoints have been also used for assessment. 
Study A301 (EVOLVE-MS-1) 
A Phase 3, OL single arm safety study of DRF (Study A301 [EVOLVE-MS1], ongoing) using exploratory 
efficacy,  clinical,  and  MRI  endpoints  attempts  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of 
ALKS-8700 in adults with RRMS. 
In this multicentre study, ALKS-8700 was administered up to 96 weeks for the treatment of RRMS. The 
target population for this study was adults, aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosed with RRMS. The study was 
to be conducted at approximately 125 sites in North America and Europe.  
Subjects entered into the study in one of two ways: 
1. De Novo Subjects: those who had not participated in any prior study of ALKS-8700. 
2. Rollover Subjects: those who had completed the Treatment Period of Study ALK-8700 A302.  
For  de  novo  subjects,  the  study  duration  was  up  to  102  weeks,  which  included  up  to  4 weeks  for 
screening, a 96-week open-label treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up period. 
A total of 1057 subjects were enrolled in this study; 593 were de novo participants who received ALKS-
8700  and  464  were  Rollover  subjects  from  Study  ALK-8700  A302  (239  subjects  had  previously  been 
treated with ALKS-8700 (DRF), and 225 participants had previously been treated with dimethyl fumarate 
[DMF]). 
Treatment ALKS-8700 dose at 462 mg BID was received from Day 1 or Day 8 depending on whether the 
subjects had previously received DRF or DMF  
In addition to assessment of safety, typical MS disease related endpoints were also used such as MRI 
endpoints (GdE lesions, new or enlarging T2 hyperintense and new unenhanced T1 hypointense lesions 
and  PBVC.  Clinical  Efficacy  Endpoints  such  as  proportion  of  participants  with  MS  relapse,  ARR, 
progression  of  disability  on  the  EDSS  scores,  proportion  of  participants  experiencing  progression  of 
disability, NEDA, and T25FW were also used. 
Tecfidera (DMF) clinical efficacy data 
C-1900 
The dose-ranging study C-1900 was 48 weeks and included 2 parts lasting 24 weeks each. Part 1 was 
DB placebo-controlled, in Part 2 (uncontrolled, dose-blinded extension portion of the study) subjects who 
received DMF (BG00012) in Part 1 continued on their randomised DMF (BG00012) dosing regimen, and 
subjects who received placebo in Part 1 were switched to DMF (BG00012) 240 mg TID. In this dose-
ranging study patients received DMF (BG00012) 120 mg per day, 360 mg per day or 720 mg per day 
for  24  weeks.  The  primary  endpoint  in  this  proof  of  concept  study  was  the  total  number  of  new  Gd-
enhancing lesions from MRI scans performed at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (calculated as the sum of the 
4 MRI scans).

Assessment report

Study  109MS301  was  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  multicentre,  DB,  rater-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose 
comparison  study  designed  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  two  doses  of  DMF  (BG00012)  in 
subjects  with  RRMS.  The  sample  size  for  this  study  was  planned  to  be  approximately  1010  subjects. 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to DMF 240 mg BID, DMF 240 mg TID, or matching placebo. 
In study 109MS301 and Study 109MS302 two different doses of DMF (BG00012) have been used: 240 
mg TID and 240 mg BID. 
An  Independent  Neurology  Evaluation  Committee  was  established  to  re-assess  relapses  that  were 
already defined by the examining neurologist. The primary endpoint, proportion of patients relapsed at 
two years was considered adequate in recent national scientific advices. ARR was included as secondary 
endpoint. A number of sensitivity analyses was performed. Time to disability progression was chosen as 
a secondary endpoint. 
The  study  included  a  two-year  treatment  period  (96  weeks),  plus  a  Follow-up  Visit  at  Week  100  for 
subjects who completed treatment and did not enter the extension study. Subjects were to receive study 
treatment  (DMF  (BG00012),  placebo,  or  GA)  for  96  weeks.  GA,  which  has  been  approved  for  the 
treatment  of  MS  in  Europe  since  2000,  was  chosen  as  active  comparator  is  considered  adequate  as 
comparator in this study. 
Study 109MS302 (CONFIRM) 
Study  109MS302  was  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  multicentre,  DB,  rater-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose 
comparison,  active  reference  comparator  study  designed  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  two 
doses of DMF in participants with RRMS. The sample size for this study was planned to be approximately 
1230    subjects. Subjects were  randomised  in  a  1:1:1:1  ratio  to  DMF  240  mg  BID,  DMF 240  mg  TID, 
DMF-matching  placebo,  or  GA  20  mg  subcutaneous  injection  four  times  a  day.  The  duration  of  study 
treatment administration was to be 96 weeks, with clinic visits every 4 weeks.  
The primary endpoint was ARR and the proportion of participants relapsed was a secondary endpoint in 
this study. Other endpoints for both Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 included: number of new or newly 
enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions,  number  of  GdE  lesions,  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions, 
disability progression measured by EDSS, MSFC, EQ-5D and VAS, SF-36, brain atrophy and whole-brain 
magnetisation transfer ratio. 
These two Phase 3 studies had a duration of two years. 
Study 109MS303 (ENDORSE) 
This  was  an  extension  to  the  two  Phase  3  studies,  Study  109MS301  and  Study  109MS302.  Eligible 
subjects from Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 were enrolled at week 96 (visit 24) of their previous 
BG00012 study, which served as the baseline visit for the extension study and followed for at least 8 
years. Approximately 1700 patients with RRMS were planned to be enrolled at approximately 375 sites 
worldwide. 
The  first  phase  was  a  multicentre,  parallel-group,  randomised,  dose-blind,  dose-comparison  period  in 
which subjects received either of the following: 
- BG00012 240 mg BID (2 capsules [120 mg each] BID and 2 placebo capsules once a day) or 
- BG00012 240 mg TID (2 capsules [120 mg each] TID) 
Subjects randomised to BG00012 in Studies 109MS301 or 109MS302 continued on the same BG00012 
dose. Subjects randomised to placebo in Study 109MS301 or 109MS302 or to GA in Study 109MS302 
were randomised to BG00012 240 mg BID or 240 mg TID in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects who switched to an 
alternative approved MS therapy in Study 109MS301 or study 109MS302 were randomised as outlined 
above according to their original treatment group in the two parent studies.

After Tecfidera had been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis at a dose of 240 mg BID, the 
study became an OL, single-dose study in a second phase where all patients received the marketed dose 
of  240  mg  BID  (2  capsules  [120  mg  each]  BID),  e.g.,  all  subjects  receiving  BG00012  240  mg  TID 
switched to BID (approved dosage) at their next study visit, once protocol Version 3 (17 March 2014) 
has been implemented. 
A total of 2079 subjects completed the parent studies, Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. Of these 1738 
Subjects (84%) were enrolled in the extension study, all of them were enrolled in the dose-blind first 
phase of the extension study. 1736 patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
In addition to the evaluation of long-term safety, Study 109MS303 investigated the long-term efficacy 
of BG00012 using clinical endpoints (including proportion of patients relapsing and ARR) and disability 
progression (EDSS) and the long-term effects of DMF (BG00012) on MS brain lesions on MRI scans in 
patients who had MRI scans. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
No  formal  efficacy  studies  using  typical  MS  disease  endpoints  with  DRF  have  been  completed  or  are 
ongoing. Dedicated pivotal studies comparing head-to-head the efficacy of DRF and DMF in RRMS, using 
efficacy  assessments  of  relevant  to  MS  primary  endpoints  have  not  been  performed  either.  DRF  can 
rather be considered a prodrug leading to the main active moiety/metabolite, MMF, which has already 
been sufficiently investigated with DMF. Hence, the development strategy for DRF was based upon the 
bioequivalent exposure levels of MMF after oral dosing of DRF 462 mg and DMF 240 mg and a PK bridging 
approach between DRF and DMF.  
The  approach  of  the  applicant  to  try  to  demonstrate  better  GI  tolerability  with  DRF  compared  to  the 
approved Tecfidera (DMF) can be followed. GI symptoms have been observed in previous studies with 
DMF (BG00012). A large percentage of subjects in DMF studies (up to 35%) had a GI disorder in Study 
109MS303. The incidence of GI disorders was highest in the first year of Study 109MS303 (ranging from 
17% to 39% of participants). The most frequent AEs by PT (occurring in more than 5% of participants) 
were diarrhoea (230 subjects, 13%), upper abdominal pain (145 subjects, 8%), nausea (117 subjects, 
7%), and abdominal pain (106 subjects, 6%). A total of 63 subjects (4%) discontinued treatment due 
to a GI disorder, and 63 subjects (4%) withdrew from the study due to a GI disorder. 
Study A302 
Endpoints – Scales IGISIS and GGISIS 
Investigation of the GI tolerability was performed using two scales (IGISIS and GGISIS) for scoring the 
intensity of the symptoms by the subjects. It should be admitted that patient reported intensity scores 
in GI symptomatology is not expected to be too complicated. Scoring relatively common symptoms such 
as nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, and diarrhoea using scales such as 
an  11-point  numeric  rating  scale  ranging  from  0  (did  not  have)  to  10  (extreme)  should  be 
straightforward. How much each symptom interfered with the ability to accomplish regular daily activities 
with a 5-point Likert scale (“Not at all” <“Slightly” < “Moderately” < “Quite a bit” < “Extremely”)] is also 
not  expected  to  create  difficulties  for  use  by  the  patients  and  subsequently  in  detecting  and  showing 
differences between treatments.   
However, there are several issues with the choice of the scales for the investigation of GI tolerability, 
namely the IGISIS and GGISIS scales: 
• 
These scales were PROs and patients responded to the questionnaires using e-diaries. Bias could 
be  an  inherent  characteristic  of  such  a  PRO  compared  to  more  reliable  clinician  reported 
outcomes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 82/148 
 
 
 
•  Validation for these two scales has not been reported. As admitted by the applicant these two 
patient-assessed  GI  tolerability  scales  have  not  been  previously  used  in  a  clinical  trial  setting 
and were tailored to capture the most relevant GI symptoms related to DMF treatment.   
• 
• 
• 
The literature reports on these two scales are associated only with DMF or DRF and it appears 
that  these  scales  have  not  been  used/validated  during  the  investigation  of  other  medicinal 
products, either.  
The fact that these scales were not validated and used for the first time in a clinical setting in a 
questionable study design to perform a comparison between DMF and DRF cannot be supportive 
of a better GI tolerability of DRF. 
The publications the applicant is referring to, are using different versions of these scales:   
- 
Paolini et al. (2008) describes the utility of the FSQ, a quantitative tool to assess patient-
reported flushing endpoints. The results show that the FSQ is a useful patient-reported 
outcome measure to objectively assess flushing associated with extended-release niacin.  
-  
Fox et al. (2016) used questionnaires, which were based on and adapted from validated 
flushing  questionnaires  used  in  studies  of  niacin  (Norquist  et  al.  2007).  The  MOGISS 
assessed global GI events (defined as one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, 
diarrhoea,  upper  abdominal  pain,  lower  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  indigestion, 
constipation, bloating, and flatulence) and their effect on the patient during the 24 hours 
before each morning dose. The MAGISS assessed individual acute GI-related symptoms 
(nausea, diarrhoea, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, vomiting, indigestion, 
constipation, bloating, and flatulence) that the patient experienced during the 10 hours 
after each morning and evening dose. 
-  
Norquist  et  al.  (2007)  developed  and  validated  a  patient-reported  FSQ.  The  primary 
flushing endpoint of the study was based on the single GFSS, an item within the FSQ, 
which assesses overall flushing severity on a 0–10 discretised analogue scale.   
IGISIS  and  GGISIS  scales  have  been  used  similarly  to  the  FSQ.  During  validation  of  the  FSQ,  the 
percentage of days with a score above a threshold of 1 and 4 were found to significantly discriminate 
among groups using FSQ. However, it is still unclear what difference between the assessed therapies 
constitutes a minimally significant or a clinically meaningful difference for IGISIS and GGISIS. 
Study A302 findings  
In study A302 for the pooled data in Parts A and B, the mean values of event days for observed diaries 
(i.e., all diaries collected, without imputation of any values) were 1.5 days and 2.5 days for the primary 
endpoint, Number of Days with Any IGISIS Symptoms Intensity Score ≥2, for the DRF and DMF groups, 
respectively. This was adjusted for study parts, region (US and non-US), age, and BMI and led to a rate 
relative to the exposure days of 0.041 for the DRF group, which was lower than the rate 0.076 for the 
DMF  group.  The  rate  ratio  for  the  pooled  Parts  A  and  B  was  0.542  (95%  CI  [0.390,  0.754])  with  a 
corresponding p=0.0003, representing a potentially relative reduction in GI symptoms of 45.8% in the 
DRF  group  compared  with  the  DMF  group.  The  applicant  is  claiming  that  in  Study  A302  the  primary 
endpoint  was  achieved  and  a  statistically  significant  reduction  (46%)  in  the  number  of  days  with  an 
IGISIS symptom intensity score ≥ 2 was observed for participants treated with DRF compared with DMF-
treated  participants.  Statistically  significant  differences  have  been  also  demonstrated  in  the  FAS 
populations  for  the  part  B  only  (0.520,  p  =  0.0007).  It  is  noted  that  Part  B  results  (key  secondary 
endpoint) were significant and consistent with the pooled results. Only Part B data can be considered as 
confirmatory, whereas the pooled analysis (Part A  and B combined) is considered as supportive only. 
Since both analyses yield comparable results, the issue is not further pursued. It should be pointed out 
Assessment report

however,  that  the  GI  tolerability  primary  endpoint  for  study  A302  was  the  Number  of  days  with  any 
IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days in Part A and Part B combined. 
Furthermore,  Part  A  was  exploratory,  and  the  findings  were  not  statistically  significant.  As  already 
mentioned, combining the results of Part A and Part B cannot be considered appropriate to substantiate 
a  claim  for  better  GI  tolerability.  The  results  which  were  not  statistically  significant,  all  numerically 
favoured diroximel DRF.

In order to put percentages in a numerical perspective and in terms of discontinuations, 4 subjects on 
ALKS 8700 (DRF) discontinued the study due to adverse events and 15 subjects in the DMF group. From 
these discontinuations, 0.8% in ALKS-8700 (DRF) were due to gastrointestinal disorders, whilst in the 
case of DMF group these were 4.8%. Out of these, one subject on ALKS-8700 (DRF) discontinued due 
to  diarrhoea  and  one  due  to  vomiting.  In  the  case  of  DMF  five  subjects  discontinued  due  to  upper 
abdominal pain, three due to diarrhoea, three due to abdominal pain, two due to vomiting, one due to 
abdominal  distention,  one  due  to  gastrointestinal  pain  and  one  due  to  nausea.  An  analysis  for 
discontinuations in Part B alone could have provided additional information, but the numbers are very 
low to allow any meaningful conclusions. 
As  already  pointed  out  above  in  the  endpoints  section,  the  approach  of  the  applicant  to  examine  the 
unblinded data from exploratory part A, then proceed to Part B and finally analyse the pooled results 
from  both  parts  is  not  considered  valid.  Hence,  only  Part  B  results  are  to  be  considered  for  the  main 
conclusion. However, also part B data show a significant difference. 
The differences observed after short term treatment, could have been indicative of better GI tolerability 
in  favour  of  DRF  compared  to  DMF.  However,  issues  with  the  findings  of  study  A302  still  remain  and 
prevent a claim for better GI tolerability for DRF:  
a)  The informative value of the results based on scales which have not been used before (please see 
also endpoints). 
The  numbers  are  too  low  to  draw  any  meaningful  conclusions.  The  findings  show  some  differences 
between ALKS-8700 (DRF) and DMF. However, the selected GI TEAEs include MedDRA preferred term:

questionable how many differences would have been detected, especially with the scoring system used 
(i.e., event days). The lack of reproducible results in a different study and the development of the IGISIS 
and GGISIS scales specifically for the Study A302 creates concerns. 
Furthermore,  irrespective  of  the  analysis  used  for  the  rate,  the  Number  of  Days  with  any  IGISIS 
Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days and consequently the rate remain very low in 
both treatment groups (Table 20).

b) 
The robustness of the statistical analyses with respect to the ambiguous pre-specification and the 
considerable amount of non-evaluable diaries (please refer to the statistical methods). 
The robustness of the analysis regarding the large amount of non-evaluable diaries still remains unclear, 
especially  since  a  reference  based  multiple  imputation  approach  was  apparently  not  performed  in  an 
appropriate way. (please see below ) 
c) 
The study duration of the “confirmatory” Part B of the study, which was very short (five weeks), 
taking into account that the DRF and DMF are intended for long-term use.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  GI  tolerability  events  are  a  known,  transient  side  effect  for  DMF,  typically 
occurring early in therapy, within the first 1 month. However, it is also noted that a five-week duration 
may not be optimal to be able to fully describe the overall adverse event  profile of DRF compared to 
DMF, nor will it characterise fully the time to onset, duration, resolution of all adverse events and provide 
a  full  picture  of  subjects’    conditions.  The  absence  of  a  placebo  group  in  Study  A302  increases  the 
uncertainty  concerning  the  findings.  Taking  into  consideration  the  transient  character  of  the  GI 
tolerability AEs, which after 1 month move into an incidence similar to that of placebo together with the

very  low  numbers,  it  is  difficult  to  make  any  clinically  significant  statements  for  potential  differences 
between DRF and DMF treatment. 
As reported by the applicant, the number of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score 
≥ 2  (event  days)  is  counted  in  the  diaries.  As  the  IGISIS  is  performed  twice  a  day,  the  applicant 
provided some clarifications whether a day with only one IGISIS questionnaire meeting the criterion 
and a day with two IGISIS questionnaires meeting the criterion equally count as one event day. It is 
unlikely that these two situations may represent the same severity and impact on daily activities (e.g., 
for  a  subject  currently  employed,  symptoms  during  the  first  dose  may  have  higher  impact  than 
symptoms during the second dose, considering standard working hours). Furthermore, in the IGISIS 
scale,  if  a  symptom  was  assessed  as  ongoing,  it  was  only  recorded  in  the  initial  intensity  score. 
Therefore,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  comment  on  which  of  the  analysed  parameters  of  the  IGISIS 
scale allowed for the assessment of the severity of the side effects, which increased in intensity over 
time (A302).  
The applicant provided an example whereby a subjects records an ongoing symptom of nausea in the 
morning  diary  with  an  intensity  score  of  3  and  over  the  course  of  the  day,  and  when  this  nausea  is 
worsened, the participant is requested to end the previous nausea symptom and enter a new nausea 
symptom with a newly categorised intensity score (for example, 6). This approach may not be a true 
reflection  of  the  clinical  condition  of  the  patient.  It  does  not  truly  represent  the  worsening  or  the 
deterioration of the symptom and may provide a false picture of the symptom, introducing a bias. The 
same applies to recording a lower intensity score for a symptom that improves. The assumption that the 
symptom is unchanged until the symptom ended, or symptom severity changed appears unverifiable, it 
would  correspond  to  a  last  observation  carried  forward  approach  and  creates  a  potentially  biased 
outcome. 
The applicant also clarified that one event day was counted when a patient recorded more than one 
symptom  in  a  day  with  a  symptom  score  ≥ 2  and  that  one  event  day  was  also  counted  in  case  a 
symptom ended in the afternoon and another symptom started.  
According to the applicant, the worst (i.e., highest) recorded score for each symptom was used when 
assessing the score for that day. Therefore, a day with at least one IGISIS questionnaire meeting the 
criterion of a symptom intensity score ≥ 2 counted as 1 event day. For example, if a participant recorded 
a score of 3 in the morning and 1 in the evening, this participant would have contributed one day with a 
score ≥2 to the analysis. A day with two IGISIS questionnaires meeting the criterion also counted as 
1 event day. For example, if a subject recorded a score of 2 in the morning and 3 in the evening, this 
subject would have contributed one day with a score ≥ 2 to the analysis. It appears that a day with at 
least one IGISIS questionnaire meeting the criterion and a day with two IGISIS questionnaires meeting 
the criterion both counted as 1 event day. These cases were both counted as 1 event day, the same as 
in  the  case  of  one  symptom  having  a  score  ≥ 2  in  a  day  (please  see  Table  24).  From  this  it  can  be 
assumed that a patient recording multiple symptoms would have also counted as 1 event day despite 
that the patient recorded more than 1 symptoms per day.  
The applicant has performed, upon request, an analysis comparing the number of event days with two 
or three different GI symptom scores ≥ 2 between treatment arms for Part A and Part B FAS population 
and for only Part B FAS population. As already pointed out previously, the analysis from both part A and 
part B cannot be considered acceptable.  
The applicant has calculated the rate ratio using the exposure days and concluded that “these analyses 
are similar to the primary endpoint from Study A302, showing an approximate 60% to 73% reduction 
on the number of days with an Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom Impact Scale (IGISIS) score of ≥ 2 
relative  to  exposure  for  diroximel  fumarate  (DRF)  when  compared  with  dimethyl  fumarate  (DMF)”. 
However, this conclusion cannot be agreed upon. From a different approach, for Part B FAS population 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 86/148 
 
 
 
the Summary of number of days with at least two IGISIS symptoms intensity scores ≥ 2 was 0.5 for DRF 
and 1.0 for DMF, respectively. Therefore, the difference between the two treatment groups is half a day 
with  at  least  two  IGISIS  symptoms  intensity  score  ≥ 2  in  a  total  of  approximately  35  exposure  days 
(~1.4%). For the same population the Summary of number of days with at least three IGISIS symptoms 
intensity scores ≥ 2 was 0.2 for DRF and 0.4 for DMF, respectively. Therefore, the difference between 
the two treatment groups is 0.2 of a day in a total of approximately 35 exposure days (~0.6%). 
The event days with at least 1 IGISIS symptoms intensity scores ≥ 2 were 1.67 for DRF and 2.51 for 
DMF  (providing  that  the  imputation  analysis  was  the  appropriate  one)  with  a  difference  between 
treatments of one day in a total of approximately 35 exposure days (~2.4%) (Table 21).

Clinical relevance of A302 findings 
The clinical relevance of the results in this study (A302) was also discussed:  
a)  It  is  still  unclear  what  difference  in  the  scales  used  in  the  Study  A302  constitutes  a  minimal 
significant  clinical  difference  (the  primary  endpoint  was  pre-defined  as  the  number  of  days 
IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 2).

b)  Days with intensity ranging from 2 to 10 were counted as events. The applicant was invited to 
further justify the selection of this cut-off and to discuss if values closer to the lower limit of the 
range (e.g., 2, 3, 4) truly represent clinically meaningful adverse events.  
The  applicant  has  chosen  the  number  of  days  any  IGISIS  Symptom  Intensity  Score  ≥ 2  relative  to 
exposure days (which are approximately 35) as the primary endpoint and not intensity scores ≥ 1, ≥ 3, 
≥ 4,  ≥ 5  or  ≥ 6.  The  cut-off  value  of  2  for  IGISIS  symptom  severity  score  was  shown  to  have  high 
sensitivity (90%) and moderate specificity (~59%) to detect moderate and severe select GI tolerability 
TEAEs (TEAEs of diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, and vomiting). 
According to the applicant, in Study A302, the primary endpoint (for part A and part B FAS population) 
was  achieved  and  a  statistically  significant  reduction  (46%)  in  the  number  of  days  with  an  IGISIS 
symptom  intensity  score  ≥ 2  was  observed  for  participants  treated  with  ALKS-8700  (DRF)  compared 
with  DMF-treated  participants  (rate  ratio  [95%  confidence  interval];  0.54  [0.39-0.74];  p =  0.0003). 
After a requested multiple imputation analysis, in Part A and Part B, the mean (95% confidence interval 
[CI]) number of event days for imputed diaries were 1.96 days (1.519, 2.395) and 2.86 days (2.282, 
3.447) for the DRF (ALKS 8700) and DMF groups, respectively. The rate (95% CI) obtained from the 
negative binomial model was 0.050 (-0.151, 0.251) for the DRF group, which was lower than the 0.081 
(-0.109,  0.271)  in  the  DMF  group.  The  rate  ratio  (95%  CI)  was  0.618  (0.352,  0.885),  with  a 
corresponding p = 0.0050. 
In the case of number of days any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 1 for Part A and B combined, the 
results for ALKS-8700 (DRF) and DMF were 2.9 and 3.9, respectively. But the rate ratio, albeit statistically 
significant,  was  0.714  indicating  only  small  differences  in  favour  of  ALKS  8700  (DRF)  and  a  potential 
reduction of 28.4% in the number of days with an IGISIS symptom intensity score ≥ 1 compared to the 
claimed reduction of 46% in the number of days with an IGISIS symptom intensity score ≥ 2. 
c)  It is noted that the Number of Days with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 3 is below 1 for 
ALKS 8700 (DRF) (0.9) for Part A and B combined and Part B only (0.7). These numbers are 
very low to draw any clinically meaningful conclusions and are questioning the clinical usefulness 
of  these  scales.  Even  lower  numbers  were  found  for  the  Number  of  Days  with  any  IGISIS 
Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 4, 5 and 6, whilst these scores would have been expected to have 
more clinical significance. The numbers with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Scores ≥ 3, 4, 5 and 
6  are  very  low  to  draw  any  clinically  meaningful  conclusions  and  are  questioning  the  clinical 
usefulness  of  these  scales.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  choice  of  the  endpoint  is  still  not 
established.  One  could  argue  that  a  result—driven  approach  was  applied  for  the  choice  of 
intensity score ≥ 2. The applicant also, upon request, discussed why the Number of Days with 
any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days is an appropriate endpoint 
to  provide  a  clinically  relevant  and  meaningful  outcome.  However,  it  could  not  be  robustly 
demonstrated that the Number of Days with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 2 relative 
to  exposure  days  is  an  appropriate  endpoint  to  provide  a  clinically  relevant  and  meaningful 
outcome.  The  number  of  event  days  are  very  small.  Even  with  an  IGISIS  symptom  intensity 
score  ≥  2  the  difference  between  the  DRF  and  the  DMF  group  was  approximately  one  day. 
Differences in the percentages of subjects with GI TEAEs and in the percentages of mean duration 
in  days  between  the  two  groups  were  also  very  small.  Additional  calculations  were  needed  in 
almost all analyses presented up to now, in order to show a reduction in GI AEs and an advantage 
in favour of DRF.  
It should be pointed out that these results were the outcome of non-validated scales, used for the first 
time in a clinical setting with a questionable study design. The clinical meaningfulness of these results is 
still unclear.

GGISIS, which assessed symptoms daily (as opposed to IGISIS assessed twice a day) accounting for the 
totality of GI symptoms and most importantly, for the overall interference of these symptoms on daily 
activities may have been preferred. The applicant was invited to justify the selection of IGISIS instead 
of GGISIS as primary endpoint and the item relative to intensity instead of the one relative to interference 
in daily activities. 
It is acknowledged that there was no previous experience with the use of IGISIS and GGISIS scales to 
inform  statistical  assumptions,  it  was  unknown  which  scale  would  be  considered  sensitive  enough  to 
detect a difference between groups.  
It is also acknowledged that the GGISIS scale, while informative, was also less sensitive than the IGISIS, 
since: the GGISIS scale was administered once daily (compared to twice for the IGISIS) and GGISIS 
scale asked subjects to recall and assess the intensity of GI symptoms in general. The evaluation of the 
number of days with a GGIGIS score ≥2 over the treatment period demonstrated worse findings for the 
primary endpoint (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.67 (0.43–1.05), p = 0.082, compared to IGISIS. Between the 
two scales the choice for IGISIS can be justifiable.  
Finally, it is considered that the “efficacy” findings for better GI tolerability are not in accordance with 
the safety GI ADRs. The applicant provided a discussion regarding the similarities in GI tolerability ADRs 
from a safety perspective and the findings from the IGISIS and GGISIS scales.  
According to the applicant, there were numerical improvements in the incidence of all GI TEAEs in the 
DRF group compared to the DMF group (34.8% for DRF vs. 49% for DMF).

However, between the DMF and the DRF group, the differences in the percentages for specific GI AEs 
(%DMF-%DRF) such as Diarrhoea (6.9%), Nausea  (6.1%), Abdominal pain  upper (8.8%), Abdominal 
pain (3.2%), Abdominal pain lower (0.8%), and Vomiting (5.2%), which were the 5 domains of IGISIS 
questionnaire, were very small and their clinical significance to justify an advantage of DRF vs DMF is 
questionable.  Taking  also  into  consideration  that  these  results  derived  from  a  study  with  two  parts 
(Safety  Population,  Parts  A  and  B),  from  which  only  the  results  from  part  B  can  be  considered  as 
appropriately analysed, then no robust conclusions can be drawn.

Mechanism and potential plausibility for better GI tolerability of DRF 
The mechanism for better DRF tolerance is unclear. Both DMF and DRF undergo pre-systemic hydrolysis 
with  an  identical  active  metabolite  (MMF).  According  to  the  applicant's  declarations,  the  primary 
metabolite of DRF, HES is inactive. Therefore, the applicant was requested to justify what mechanism 
could lay behind the better tolerance of DRF.  
The applicant presented a discussion of the probable basis for the better tolerability of DRF relative to 
DMF. Among the likely reasons for better gastrointestinal-related tolerance were the lower concentration 
of methanol formed, the larger particle size of DRF limiting binding to receptors within the gastrointestinal 
tract, and the lower electrophilicity of DRF.  
Nevertheless, all these reasons are speculative. There is no evidence to support that any of the presented 
mechanisms are important in the hypothesised better tolerance of DRF. 
Statistical analyses 
In addition, Part B in Study A302, because of the adaptive design, the primary endpoint and sample size 
were  finalised  after  the  unblinded  data  from  exploratory  Part  A  have  been  examined.  Due  to  this 
unblinded interim analysis after which the final version of the SAP was generated pooling of both parts 
cannot be accepted as a valid procedure. The primary analysis based on pooled Part A and Part B data 
is not acceptable due to the unblinded interim analysis with a potential type-1 error inflation and the 
finalisation  of  the  SAP  after  the  interim  analysis.  The  analysis  of  the  pooled  data  could  therefore  be 
biased. Only Part B data should be taken into account for the efficacy conclusions, if any, with respect 
to all analyses.  
According to the applicant, there were consistent patterns of improvement favouring DRF in both Part A 
and Part B, which consisted of two separate study populations and these findings suggest that results 
can  be  reproduced  utilizing  these  scales.  This  cannot  be  agreed.  Reproducibility  would  have  been 
achieved in case two different studies would have been conducted and produced the same outcome. The 
main analysis (if based on Part B data), i.e., the use of a negative binomial model for the number of 
days with any symptom intensity score ≥ 2 using the log number of exposure days as an offset parameter 
is  acceptable  in  general.  However,  the  analysis  was  not  clearly  specified  with  respect  to  potential 
additional covariates. In addition, it is not clear whether the envisaged conditional procedure where the 
use of the model depends on the outcome still maintains the type-1 error, although inflation may not be 
considerable.  This  may,  however,  not  be  considered  as  a  relevant  issue  since  the  negative  binomial 
model was finally used with the initially planned covariates. In order to show robustness, the applicant 
was requested to provide sensitivity analyses based on the proposed Poisson model with adjustment for 
overdispersion and the zero-inflated negative binomial model.  
Furthermore, as the covariates were not properly pre-specified in the SAP (and age was added as an 
additional  covariate),  the  analysis  cannot  be  considered  as  fully  pre-specified.  The  applicant  was  also 
requested to provide an analysis without the factor age as a covariate as well as additional sensitivity 
analyses with added relevant baseline covariates.  
All requested sensitivity analyses have been provided with comparable results with the primary analysis. 
The  main  issue  in  the  analysis  is  based  on  the  improper  handling  of  missing  evaluable  diaries.  For  a 
considerable number of days, the diaries were not evaluable or valid, which may also include completely 
missing  diaries.  No  missing  data  imputation  was  neither  planned  nor  performed  for  these  days.  The 
analysis was based on the assumption that the absence of a valid diary (or evaluability of a diary) was 
completely at random and the actual endpoint refers to a mixture of the presence of relevant symptoms 
(≥ 2) and the evaluability of the diary. Hence, the applicant should justify the validity and robustness of 
the conclusions with respect to the large number of non-evaluable diaries and whether the actual analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 90/148 
 
 
 
yields an unbiased estimation for the relative reduction in days with any symptom intensity score ≥ 2, if 
all diaries were evaluable. 
Furthermore, the applicant was requested to provide relevant sensitivity analyses using proper missing 
data imputation methods that show the robustness of the results including an analysis where the data 
on  the  non-evaluable  days  are  imputed  using  reference  based  multiple  imputation  conditioned  on 
baseline covariates and the day of treatment.  
The  applicant  did  not  initially  implement  a  reference  based  multiple  imputation  approach  to  show 
robustness of the results. A reference based multiple imputation approach should use the data from the 
reference group only to generate the distributions to be used for multiple imputation. This approach is 
required to assess robustness of the results by assuming no difference to the reference in case of missing 
data.  The  applicant  provided  an  additional  analysis.  However,  according  to  the  description  of  the 
applicant it remained unclear whether this additional analysis corresponded to a reference-based multiple 
imputation. The applicant wrote that “five repetitions were obtained for analyses to show robustness of 
the missing imputation of the difference of treatment effect on the number of days with IGISIS symptom 
intensity score ≥ 2”. It should be noted that multiple imputation would require the combination of multiply 
imputed datasets applying Rubin’s rule.  
The applicant finally provided a detailed description of the used approach, the SAS code used and the 
corresponding output, together with a proper reference-based multiple imputation with 20 repetitions 
applying Rubin’s rule to combine the multiply imputed data sets.  It is noted that the point estimate of 
the rate ratio increased slightly, but the confidence interval got much larger and the p-value increased 
likely due to the increased variability of the multiple imputation approach although the result remained 
statistically significant. It seems that the approach had not been correctly applied in the first version. 
Single imputation of the days starting with Day 39 might be debatable (underestimating the variance for 
these days), but it is understood that otherwise the estimation approach could have been unstable due 
to the low number of subjects with more than 38 days.   
With respect to the other endpoints, MS disease relevant assessments using EDSS, T25-FW, SF-12, and 
EQ-5D-5L were not expected to be clinically meaningful given the short duration of the study, as admitted 
also by the applicant. However, some indications on the efficacy of DRF in MS could be obtained. These 
assessments could be considered supportive, complement the bioavailability/bioequivalence studies and 
provide further support for the approval of DRF based on DMF efficacy data. 
Study A301 
This  ongoing,  multicentre,  open-label  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and 
tolerability  of  DRF/ALKS  8700  administered  up  to  96  weeks  for  the  treatment  of  RRMS  as  well  as 
exploratory efficacy endpoints. The interim clinical data as of 07 February 2020 have been summarised. 
It  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  the  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  study 
population  reflected  those  of  the  patient  population  with  RRMS  for  whom  DRF/ALKS  8700  would  be 
indicated. 
Mean exposure to study treatment for the de novo, DRF/ALKS 8700 Rollover, and DMF Rollover groups 
was 590.0, 426.5, and 446.3 days, respectively. 
All efficacy analyses were exploratory in nature. After exposure to DRF/ALKS 8700 for up to 96 weeks, 
the  key  efficacy  outcomes,  including  MRI  endpoints  and  relapse  rates,  ARR  and  disability  assessment 
(EDSS  and  T25-FW),  were  comparable  to  the  findings  from  DMF  Phase  3  studies  and  only  minimally 
deteriorated from baseline. A low ARR 0.14 and a reduction in the mean number of GdE lesions (-0.082) 
was observed at week 96. The number of participants with confirmed disability progression sustained for 
12 weeks was low across all groups (8.1% in the de novo group, 7.2% in the DRF Rollover group, and 
8.9% in the DMF Rollover group). The mean change from baseline in T25-FW scores was 0.034, -0.178

and 0.822 seconds in the de novo group, the ALKS 8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group, 
respectively).  Mean  EDSS  scores  across  enrolment  groups  were  generally  stable  from  Baseline  up  to 
Week  96.  MRI  endpoints  showed  a  decrease  in  disease  activity  and  stabilisation  of  disease  following 
treatment  with  DRF/ALKS  8700  in  those  subjects  continuing  treatment.  The  results  for  other  clinical 
outcome measures (disability progression, EDSS, NEDA-3, and T25-FW) showed a sustained effect on 
disease  activity  and  were  consistent  with  the  MRI  and  ARR  results.  The  results  are  favouring  DRF  in 
comparison with reported values for MS untreated subjects. These findings are clear indicators of the 
sustainability  of  a  treatment  benefit  for  DRF/ALKS  8700  (and  its  main  active  moiety  MMF). 
Patient-reported outcomes did not show notable improvement from baseline. The SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L 
scores demonstrated overall stability or minor decreases over time. 
The mean change from baseline in the GdE lesions count for the de novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover 
group, and the DMF Rollover group was -0.85, -0.49, and -0.97 lesions, respectively, which corresponds 
to 64.4%, 80.3%, and 80.2% decrease from baseline, respectively. Overall, there was an increase in 
the proportion of participants with 0 GdE lesions (20.7%) from Baseline to Week 96 as well as decreases 
in the proportions of participants with 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and ≥ 9 GdE lesions (-14.7%, -3.8%, and -1.9%, 
respectively) from baseline to Week 96. Across the 3 groups, a high proportion of participants (> 90%) 
had 0 GdE lesions at Week 96. The efficacy results for clinical and MRI endpoints in participants with 
RRMS  treated  with  DRF  in  Study  A301  showed  treatment  effects  in  line  with  expectations  from  data 
available for DMF.  
DMF clinical efficacy data 
These  data  have  already  been  assessed  during  the  MA  procedure  for  Tecfidera  (DMF,  BG00012). 
According to the applicant, study C-1900 supported the continued development of the DMF 240 mg dose 
in the Phase 3 studies.   
Results from the pivotal Phase 3 studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 demonstrated that DMF (BG00012) 
240 mg BID consistently provided significant improvement compared with placebo in both clinical and 
MRI  outcome  measures  and  showed  increased  efficacy  compared  with  an  approved  first-line  therapy, 
GA, in subjects with RRMS. These results were confirmed by the integrated analyses of the two pivotal 
Phase 3 studies with DMF.  
Altogether the evidence of clinical efficacy for DMF (BG00012) as a disease modifying therapy in patients 
with RRMS based on two Phase 3 studies is also supported by MRI outcome measures in the Phase 2 
study.  
Final  results  from  extension  Study  109MS303  showed  that  the  majority  of  participants  did  not  have 
disease  progression  as  measured  by  an  increase  in  EDSS  (24-week  confirmation).  MRI  assessments 
showed that the majority of participants within the MRI cohort had no GdE lesions and the number of 
GdE lesions remained low. Extension Study 109MS303 confirmed the maintained treatment effect of DMF 
(BG00012) 240 mg BID, with low relapse rates and confirmed slowing of the disability progression for 
up to ten years of treatment (Phase 3 studies combined). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Any  reference  to  the  paediatric  studies  with  DMF  in  the  SmPC  of  Vumerity  DRF  currently  cannot  be 
justified since data are very limited.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Since comparative bioavailability examination of DMF and DRF has shown bioequivalence (at the level of 
exposure to MMF), the efficacy results from the DMF clinical programme can be used to support efficacy 
claims for DRF. Both prodrugs DMF and DRF share the same active moiety, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), 
and the pivotal data (from Studies C-1900, 109MS301 and 109MS302) together with other supportive 
studies justified the approval of DMF in RRMS. However, the claim for additional benefit of improved GI 
tolerability of DRF compared to DMF has not been robustly demonstrated. Small differences between the 
two  groups  in  the  mean  number  of  days  with  IGISIS  symptoms  intensity  scores  ≥  2,  using  scales  of 
questionable validity and specificity, with results from both parts A and B and from a single Study A302, 
cannot be considered as an appropriate justification to support an advantage in GI tolerability for DRF 
compared to DMF. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The marketing application for DRF is founded on the principle  of bioequivalent exposure of the active 
therapeutic moiety MMF after administration of 462 mg DRF and 240 mg DMF (the active substance of 
Tecfidera). Consequently, the efficacy and safety profiles of DRF and DMF are expected to be similar. 
Therefore, 
the 
clinical 
safety 
relies  on 
the  data  already  assessed 
for  Tecfidera 
(EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1). 
The titration scheme in the DRF studies is analogous to that in the DMF studies. It implies initiation of 
either drug with half the maintenance dose at Day 1 (i.e., 231 mg DRF BID and 120 mg DMF BID), which 
is then to be increased to the full dose on Day 7 (i.e., 462 mg DRF BID  and 240 mg DMF BID). 
The clinical programme of DRF consists of ten completed Phase 1 studies (nine in healthy volunteers and 
one in subjects with renal impairment) and two Phase 3 studies in adult subjects with RRMS. Safety data 
have been presented separately due to differences in the study design for the two Phase 3 studies:  
• 
the  completed  11-week  DB  and  active-controlled  study  A302  against  DMF,  with  a  five-week 
treatment period (including one week titration) and, 
• 
the ongoing OL Study A301, which aimed to address safety and tolerability up to 96 weeks of 
DRF treatment in DRF and DMF rollovers from A302 and de novo subjects. 
The  safety  population  included  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  in  the 
Phase 1 studies and Phase 3 studies. 
Safety presentation and discussion for the two Phase 3 DRF studies is based on the evaluation of TEAEs, 
Adverse event of special interest (AESIs), clinical laboratory testing, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and 
C-SSRS scores for the safety population. 
Long-term safety data are so far limited and interim data derive from the ongoing OL Study A301 with 
the latest data cut-off of 01 September 2020. Final data of A301 is not expected within the course of 
this procedure. 
Clinical  safety  of  DMF  focuses  on  the  results  of  four  clinical  studies  in  adult  RRMS  subjects,  i.e.,  one 
Phase 2 dose-ranging study (C-1900, 24 weeks of duration), two pivotal, placebo (and one also active) 
controlled Phase 3 studies (109MS301 and 109MS302; each of 96 weeks duration), and an eight year 
OLE Study 109MS303, for which interim data were available and assessed as part of the Tecfidera MAA 
(data  cut-off  03  August  2011).  Results  of  Study  109MS303  with  data  cut-off  08  November  2019  are 
under evaluation in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G) at the time of this assessment. 
DMF  studies  were  pooled  to  assess  short-term  safety  (Pool  A;  controlled  DMF  studies)  and  long-term 
clinical safety (Pool B; controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies).

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure 
Across the DRF clinical programme, 1461 subject received at least one dose of DRF in 12 clinical studies. 
This includes 390 subjects in the Phase 1 studies with an exposure ranging from single doses up to 18 
doses of study treatment over 10 days (366 healthy volunteers and 24 subjects with renal impairment).  
1071 subjects received at least one dose of DRF in the Phase 3 studies A302 and A301 as per the original 
cut-off  date  07  February  2020.  The  total  extent  of  exposure  to  DRF  in  subjects  forming  the  Phase  3 
safety population with at least one dose of DRF amounts to a mean (SD) of 523.9 days (213.61). 972 
subjects  (88.6%)  received  DRF  for  more  than  six  months.  826  subjects  (75.3%)  and  499  subjects 
(45.5%) received DRF for more than 12 months and 24 months, respectively, with a total subject-years 
of exposure to DRF of 1536.21 years.  
In Study A301, the safety population comprised 1057 subjects, who received at least one dose of DRF, 
and who were allocated to three enrolment groups: 593 de novo subjects (who had not participated in 
any prior DRF study), 239 subjects in the DRF, and 225 subjects in the DMF rollover group from A302. 
Subjects in the de novo group were in the study for a longer time compared with subjects in the Rollover 
groups. The mean (SD) duration of exposure to DRF in Study A301 (data cut-off 01 September 2020) 
was 561.4 (190.43) days.  
In Study A302, 504 of 506 enrolled subjects received at least one dose of DRF (253 in the DRF and 251 
in the DMF group). The mean (SD) duration of exposure to study treatment in the overall population was 
34.6 (5.34) days and the exposure was similar in the two treatment groups. 
The integrated safety database for DMF (referred to as Pool B data) included 2468 subjects exposed to 
DMF (for a total duration of ~3600 subject years) and 836 subjects were exposed to placebo. 1477 of 
2468 subjects (60%) were exposed to DMF for ≥48 weeks and 1056 subjects (43%) were exposed for ≥
96 weeks. 
Pool A (placebo-controlled) data served as the main dataset to allow for evaluation of treatment-related 
AEs with DMF 240 mg BID and the 240 mg TID doses up to two years of exposure and included 1720 
subjects exposed to DMF (769 and 823 subjects, respectively, received DMF 240 mg BID and DMF 240 
mg TID). 836 subjects received placebo. Pool A safety data provided a mean duration of exposure to 
240 mg DMF (which results in an equivalent exposure to MMF as with DRF 462 mg BID) of 76.58 weeks. 
Pool B also includes patients with exposure to DMF up to four years. 
At  present,  the  longest  exposure  to  DMF  derives  from  Study  109MS303  with  the  final  cut-off  date  8 
November  2019:  52%  and  40%  of  patients  were  treated  with  DMF  for  ≥  6  years  and  ≥  8  years, 
respectively, and the median duration of exposure to study treatment (min, max) was 5.848 (0.00, 9.43) 
years. 
Subject disposition and baseline characteristics in DRF phase 3 studies and DMF pools 
As of the data cut-off date 01 September 2020 in Study A301, 659 of 1057 patients (62.3%) completed 
the study, 152 subjects are ongoing (14.4%), and 246 (23.3%) subjects discontinued the study. The 
main  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  adverse  events  (34.6%),  subject  withdrawal  (31.3%),  lost  to 
follow-up  (12.6%).  When  stratified  by  previous  treatment  (de  novo  subjects,  rollovers  from  A302  on 
DRF or DMF), discontinuations following AEs were highest in the de novo group (40%) and lower in DRF 
and DMF rollovers (33.3% and 24.1%). In Study A302, 94.8% of subjects completed the study, with a 
slightly higher discontinuation rate in the DMF as compared with the DRF group (7.2% vs. 3.2%). The 
most  common  reason  for  study  discontinuation  for  both  treatment  groups  was  adverse  events  (DRF 
group: 1.6%; DMF group: 6.0% of subjects). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 94/148 
 
 
 
In  the  Tecfidera  Pool  A,  discontinuation  rates  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  (25  to  33%)  and 
main reasons were consent withdrawn, “other,” MS relapse (in the placebo group), and AEs being the 
most common reason for treatment discontinuations in the DMF groups. 
In Study 109MS303, 963 subjects (55%) discontinued study treatment with the most common reasons 
being  consent  withdrawn  (17%),  AEs  (14%),  and  other  reasons  (12%).  974  of  1736  subjects  (56%) 
discontinued the study. The most common reasons for study discontinuation were consent withdrawn 
(17%), AEs (14%), and other reasons (13%). 
Regarding baseline demographics in the DRF  Study A301, the median age for all subjects was 43 years 
old, with the median age in de novo subjects being 41 years old, while rollovers from A302 were older 
(median 45 years old for DRF and 44 years old for DMF rollovers). In the Tecfidera Pool A, the median 
age was lower as in the DRF studies (between 36 and 39 years old). 
Study inclusion criteria in the DRF clinical programme allowed subjects up to 65 years old to be included 
while in the DMF pivotal studies, subjects up to an age of 55 years could participate. 139 of 1057 subjects 
(13.2%) in the DRF Study A301 were > 55 years of age. Three subjects had a baseline age of 65 years.  
The gender distribution female to male (~2:1) was similar in the DRF and DMF studies as was the race 
distribution  (the  vast  majority  being  Caucasians).  However,  region  was  different  in  the  two  study 
programs  with  US  subjects  being  represented  in  almost  half  of  the  study  population  in  the  DRF 
programme. In the DMF Pool A, approx. 15% of subjects were from the US. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
AEs  reported  in  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  3  studies  with  DRF  demonstrated  that  the  safety  profile  is 
consistent with that of DMF, which has been assessed at the time of the MAA for Tecfidera. 
DRF clinical studies 
Across the Phase 1 studies, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs ranged from 31.0% to 94.4%. No 
TEAEs were severe or serious. For both groups of subjects treated with DRF in the Phase 1 studies, i.e., 
healthy volunteers and subjects with renal impairment, the most frequently reported TEAE was flushing 
and GI events. The incidence of GI events was slightly lower for DRF as compared with DMF in most of 
the studies. Both events were reported more frequently with higher doses administered. No significant 
differences in safety or tolerability were observed in healthy volunteers across different renal impairment 
groups. 
In the Phase 3 studies A301 and A302, 88.2% and 81% of subjects overall had at least one TEAE. 61.6% 
and  68.7%  of  subjects  had  at  least  one  TEAE  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study 
treatment (Table 23). 
Most of the TEAEs in Studies A301 and A302 were mild or moderate in severity. Severe TEAEs, serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs)  and  TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  were  infrequent  but 
were reported more frequently in patients in Study A301. Regarding the two treatment groups in A302, 
SAEs  occurred  in  a  similar  percentage  in  both  groups,  whereas  all  other  TEAE  categories  were  more 
frequently reported in patients on DMF as compared to DRF.

The most common TEAEs in Study A301 (> 10% in the overall population) were flushing (27.2%), MS 
relapse  (19%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (14.3%),  nasopharyngitis  (12.9%),  lymphopenia 
(11.2%), and diarrhoea (10.3%).  
Most TEAEs in Study A301 were mild (29%) or moderate (49.9%) in severity, and 9.3% of TEAEs were 
severe, with the most frequently (in more than 5 subjects) being MS relapse, back pain, flushing, and 
fatigue.  
61.6% of subjects had treatment-related TEAEs. Flushing was the most frequently reported treatment-
related TEAE (26.9%), followed by lymphopenia (10.8%), diarrhoea (7.5%), and pruritus (5.0%). 
The overall incidence of flushing and flushing-related AEs in Study A301 was 37.2%, mainly reported as 
mild  to  moderate  in  severity,  and more  subjects  reported  such  events  in  the  de  novo  group  (49.2%) 
compared to rollovers (22.2% and 21.3% of subjects in the DRF and DMF rollover groups, respectively). 
The difference is due to previous treatment with DRF or DMF in rollovers during A302, in line with the 
timely  course  of  these  events,  i.e.  onset  during  the  first  month  of  treatment  followed  by  a  decrease 
thereafter. The median duration was 12.0 days (1 to 679 days). Less than 1% of patients reported severe 
flushing/ flushing-related TEAEs or had their dose either reduced or temporarily interrupted (all in the 
de novo group) or discontinued due to flushing or flushing-related AEs. 
31.6% of all subjects had AEs in the System Organ Class (SOC) of gastrointestinal disorders with the 
most commonly reported (≥ 5% of subjects in any group) AEs being diarrhoea (10.3%), nausea (6.8%), 
constipation  (4.4%),  and  abdominal  pain  upper  (3.7%).  The  incidence  of  diarrhoea  and  nausea  was 
slightly higher in the de novo group (11.1% and 7.6% of subjects, respectively) than in the DRF rollover 
group (7.5% and 5.0% of subjects, respectively), and it was 11.1% and 6.7% in the DMF rollover group. 
Overall, 1.8% of subjects had severe GI events in the GI disorders SOC. The incidence of GI events was 
highest during the first month of treatment. The outcome of GI events in a majority of these subjects 
was  recovered/resolved.  Median  duration  of  these  events  ranged  from  approximately  4.5  to  6 days 
across the three groups. Three subjects (0.3%) discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs of diarrhoea. 
1.8% of subjects had their dose reduced or interrupted temporarily due to either diarrhoea, nausea, or 
other GI TEAEs. 
In Study A302, the most common TEAEs (≥ 10% of patients overall) with DRF and DMF were flushing 
(32.8% and 40.6%), diarrhoea (15.4% and 22.3%), nausea (14.6% and 20.7%), and abdominal pain 
upper  (6.7%  and  15.5%).  Most  TEAEs  in  study  A302  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  68.7%  of 
patients had treatment-related TEAEs, and these were mainly events of flushing, diarrhoea, nausea, and 
abdominal pain upper. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 96/148 
 
 
 
 
Flushing and flushing-related AEs combined were reported in 50.4% of subjects overall, 45.8% in the 
DRF group and 55% of subjects in the DMF group. No subjects in either treatment group discontinued 
the study drug as a result of flushing or flushing-related AEs. The median time to onset of flushing and 
related events was 1 day, and the median duration was 2 days. 
Study A302 was a direct comparison of the effects of DRF and DMF on GI tolerability. Gastrointestinal 
disorders TEAEs were reported by 41.9% of subjects (34.8% on DRF and 49% on DMF). The incidence 
of diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, and vomiting was lower in the DRF than in 
the DMF group. Severe AEs were reported by three subjects in the DRF group and six subjects in the 
DMF group. GI TEAEs resulted in study discontinuation in 2.8% of subjects (0.8% in the DRF group and 
4.8%  in  the  DMF  group).  The  time  to  onset  of  GI  events  was  generally  within  the  first  two weeks  of 
treatment  in  both  groups,  and  mean  duration  for  the  most  common  GI  TEAEs  was  up  to  seven days. 
Given that no significant difference on GI tolerability with DRF over DMF can be claimed, information in 
Section 4.8 relies on the pivotal DMF experience. ADR data from Study A302 on GI tolerability has been 
summarised in the SmPC Section 5.1.  
The applicant presented justification for not presenting tabulated adverse drug reaction data separately 
for DRF and DMF owing to their similar safety profiles. It is concurred with the applicant that the design 
of the DRF studies is not adequate per se to evaluate frequencies of ADRs given that A302 is short-term 
and only active-controlled and A301 is an uncontrolled, open-label trial. Comparison between TEAEs in 
A301 (in ≥5% of subjects) and TEAEs in the DMF pivotal studies demonstrated that frequency categories 
of the ADRs defined in the Tecfidera SmPC broadly complied with those observed for DRF in study A301. 
For some ADRs determined for Tecfidera, the frequencies with DRF were lower (e.g. nausea, abdominal 
pain upper, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, hot flush, albumin urine present, AST increased, and 
rash). Thus, the approach to rely on the ADR frequencies with Tecfidera is considered conservative and 
acceptable. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC indicates that Vumerity can be taken with or without food (with reference to 
Section 5.2) given that the study protocol of Study A302 allowed both situations. Upon request and in 
line with Tecfidera, the applicant added wording in order to indicate that food might improve tolerability 
of DRF in subjects experiencing flushing or GI adverse reactions.  
Upon request, presentation of incidences of AEs with DRF concerning Sections 4.8 and 5.1 in the SmPC 
has been brought in line with that of Tecfidera in that percentages are expressed based on TEAEs. 
DMF pivotal studies 
For  details  on  common  adverse  events  with  DMF 
it 
is  referred  to  the  Tecfidera  EPAR 
(EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1).  
Common adverse events were reported in a similar number across treatment groups (87-95%; Pool A). 
Significant  differences  in  the  incidences  of  common  adverse  events  between  groups  were  seen  for 
flushing (including flushing-related events (9% placebo vs. 45% DMF BID), and GI disorders TEAEs (31% 
placebo vs. 40% DMF BID).  
Treatment-related AEs frequently derived from the vascular disorders SOC, GI disorders SOC, and skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC.  
In DMF Pools A and B, flushing and flushing-related symptoms, GI events, as well as increases in ALT 
were found to occur frequently during the first 1 to 3 months of treatment. The majority of TEAEs with 
DMF were mild to moderate in severity. The most common severe TEAE reported was MS relapse (5% 
placebo, 3% DMF BID). 
In Pool A, AEs reported at an increased incidence (≥ 2%) in patients treated with DMF BID compared to 
placebo  were  flushing  and  hot  flush,  GI  events  (e.g.,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  abdominal  pain  upper,

abdominal pain, vomiting, and dyspepsia), skin events (pruritus, rash, and erythema), nasopharyngitis, 
urinary  tract  infection,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  albumin  urine  present,  proteinuria, 
microalbuminuria. There was no clear dose-relation for most of the events except for GI events. 
ADRs with DMF have been defined: 
• 
• 
based on the differences in incidences (≥ 2%) for TEAEs between DMF 240 mg BID and placebo 
in the two pivotal trials, i.e., flushing and hot flush, GI events (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal 
pain upper, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia), skin events (pruritus, rash, and erythema), 
albumin urine present, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and lymphopenia; and  
based  on  the  mode  of  action  of  DMF  lacking  the  2%  difference  criterion,  i.e.  gastroenteritis, 
leukopenia,  burning  sensation,  gastritis,  GI  disorder,  proteinuria,  feeling  hot,  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased, white blood cell (WBC) count decreased, and leukopenia. 
DMF long-term clinical Study 109MS303 
In Study 109MS303, no new safety findings could be identified with long-term DMF treatment.  
94% of all DMF-treated subjects reported TEAEs, and these were mainly rated as moderate in severity. 
Severe  AEs  were  reported  by  21%  of  subjects  with  the  most  frequently  severe  AE  being  MS  relapse 
(4%). 29% had a TEAE that was rated as related to study treatment.  
TEAEs  most  frequently  reported  were  MS  relapse  (between  30%  and  42%  across  treatment  groups), 
nasopharyngitis (between 17% and 31% across treatment groups), urinary tract infection (between 14% 
and  25%  across  treatment  groups),  and  flushing  (between  12%  and  33%  across  treatment  groups). 
TEAEs often reported as treatment-related were flushing, diarrhoea, and upper abdominal pain. Overall, 
reporting of flushing decreased as compared to phase 3 pivotal DMF studies. No increased incidence of 
events  related  to  GI  tolerability  was  noted  with  long-term  treatment  (35%  of  patients  reported  GI 
events). 
Adverse events of special interest 
AESIs were defined primarily based on the established safety profile, known important risks of DMF in 
MS  patients,  and  nonclinical  data  relevant  to  safety  for  DRF  and  DMF,  i.e,.  Anaphylaxis/angioedema, 
Opportunistic infections, All serious infections, Lymphopenia, Liver injury, Malignancies and premalignant 
conditions, Renal injury, Cardiac disorders, Pancreatitis, and GI tolerability. 
Anaphylaxis and angioedema as well as events of pancreatitis were neither reported in Study A302 nor 
in Study A301.  
Opportunistic infections/ all serious infections 
The RMP of DRF (in line with DMF) lists PML as an important identified risk and serious and opportunistic 
infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) as important potential risk. 
No events of opportunistic infections and serious infections were reported with DRF and DMF in Study 
A302. 
In  Study  A301,  lymphocyte  counts  were  closely  monitored  to  mitigate  the  risk  for  life-threatening 
infections (including PML). 
0.6%  of  subjects  reported  opportunistic  infections  (oral  candidiasis,  three  subjects;  vulvovaginal 
candidiasis, two subjects; candida infection, two subjects; oesophageal candidiasis, one subject); one 
subject  had  both  OIs  of  oral  candidiasis  and  candida  infection,  and  one  subject  had  both  OIs  of 
oesophageal candidiasis and candida infection. OIs were mild (four subjects) or moderate (two subjects), 
not  serious  or  associated  with  lymphopenia,  and  rated  not  related  to  study  treatment,  except  for  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 98/148 
 
 
 
TEAEs of oral candidiasis and candida infection; all but the TEAE of candida infection resolved by the cut-
off date. 
0.9% of subjects reported AEs associated with serious infections; two subjects with appendicitis and one 
subject  each  with  cellulitis,  urinary  tract  infection,  chronic  gastritis,  pharyngitis,  pneumonia  bacterial, 
pneumonia, and sepsis. None of the AEs except for the fatal and serious TEAE of pneumonia bacterial 
led to discontinuation from the study, and all but the AE of pharyngitis were assessed as not related to 
study  treatment.  These  events  were  not  found  to  be  related  to  severe  prolonged  lymphocytopenia. 
However,  a  relation  cannot  be  excluded  given  that  ALC  < 0.5x109/L  persisting  for  >  4  weeks  led  to 
discontinuation from treatment. 
Although not being a designated serious infection, 22 subjects (2.1%) have been identified with mild to 
moderate Herpes Zoster and one subject with varicella zoster virus infection in A301. Herpes Zoster is a 
known risk with Tecfidera treatment and labelled in the product information. 
Infections were a designated AESI in the pivotal DMF clinical studies: Pool A showed slightly higher rates 
for infections in DMF-treated subjects compared to placebo (56% placebo vs. 60% DMF BID). Events 
that  occurred  at  an  incidence  ≥  2%  higher  in  the  DMF  BID  group  compared  to  placebo  were 
nasopharyngitis (20% placebo vs. 22% DMF BID), UTI (11% vs. 14%), and URTI (11% vs. 13%). Most 
events  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  with  severe  events  similarly  reported  in  placebo-  and  DMF 
treated subjects. No increase in the incidence or change in the pattern of infections was observed when 
evaluating  infections  by  three-month  intervals.  Serious  infections  were  reported  in  2%  of  DMF  BID-
treated  subjects  (vs.  1%  on  placebo),  the  most  common  being  gastroenteritis  (<  1%  on  DMF). 
Incidences of infections were found similar in placebo and DMF BID-treated patients across post-baseline 
lymphocyte count groups. No serious infections were reported in DMF-treated subjects with a minimum 
post-baseline lymphocyte count < 0.5 x 109/L or a WBC count < 3.0 x 109/L. No increased incidence of 
serious infections was observed in DMF-treated subjects with lymphocyte counts ≥ 0.5 to < 0.8 x 109/L 
compared with either placebo overall or DMF-treated subjects, who had higher lymphocyte counts. 
No opportunistic infections were reported for subjects on DMF in Pool A. 
Lymphopenia (incl. lymphopenia and lymphocyte count decreased) 
Decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts are listed as important identified risk in the RMP for DRF 
in line with DMF.  
In the DRF clinical studies, there were no SAE reports of lymphopenia or lymphocyte count decreased, 
and there were no infections associated with lymphopenia or lymphocyte count decreased. 
In  A301,  16.7%  of  subjects  (n=177)  had  TEAEs  in  the  lymphopenia  category  (i.e.,  lymphopenia  and 
lymphocyte count decreased) with a higher incidence in the rollover groups compared with the de novo 
group. Most events were mild or moderate in severity and rated as severe in six subjects; the majority 
of  TEAEs  was  assessed  as  related  to  DRF.  The  incidence  of  the  first  occurrence  of  these  events  was 
highest at ≥ 3 months to < 6 months and at ≥ 12 months to < 18 months of exposure (4.1% and 4.3%, 
respectively).  More  than  half  of  the  events  were  resolved  by  the  clinical  cut-off  date.  The  mean  (SD) 
durations  of  lymphopenia  and  lymphocyte  count  decreased  were  169.7  (176.00)  and  170.4  (206.26) 
days,  respectively.  Treatment-emergent  lymphopenia  and  lymphocyte  count  decreased  AEs  led  to 
treatment interruption in 2.6% (28/1057) of patients. 2.1% (22 subjects) discontinued study treatment 
due to lymphopenia TEAEs. 
In Study A302, 0.8% of subjects (n=4) reported an AESI associated with lymphopenia; one subject on 
DRF and three subjects on DMF; all of the events were mild in severity. The subject in the DRF group 
experienced  lymphopenia  (ALC  0.63  x  109/L)  and  reported  a  concomitant  non-serious  AE  of  upper 
respiratory tract infection assessed as not related to study drug. Both events resolved by the end of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021

study with a lymphocyte count of 1.44 x 109/L. One subject in the DMF group had a lymphocyte count 
of 0.75 x 109/L at the time of the AE, later rising to a peak of 0.82 x 109/L, and reported a concomitant 
AE  of  MS  relapse.  Two  other  subjects  in  the  DMF  group  had  lymphocyte  counts  of  0.80  x  109/L  and 
0.45 x 109/L at the time of the AE, with no concomitant infection. Dose remained unchanged in these 
subjects. 
Malignancies and pre-malignant conditions 
DRF in line with DMF bears the risk for inducing malignancies with longer treatment duration, as it is an 
immunomodulatory therapy.  
There were no reports of malignancies or premalignant events in Study A302. 
In Study A301, 0.5% of subjects (n=5) reported malignancies (basal cell carcinoma, Bowen’s disease 
(squamous  cell  carcinoma),  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  invasive  ductal  breast  carcinoma,  and 
malignant  melanoma).  0.7%  of  patients  (n=7)  reported  premalignant  conditions  (endometrial 
hyperplasia (3 patients), cervical dysplasia, dysplastic naevus, large intestine polyp, laryngeal dysplasia, 
and leucoplakia). 
The incidence of malignancies was similar to that in the controlled Tecfidera clinical programme. In Pool 
A,  the  incidence  of  malignancies  was  low  and  balanced  (<  1%  [three  subjects]  placebo,  <  1%  [two 
subjects] DMF- BID, <1% [two subjects] DMF TID, 1% [four subjects] GA). Malignancies included breast 
cancer, basal cell skin carcinoma, and breast neoplasm in the placebo group; transitional cell carcinoma 
of renal pelvis and basal cell skin carcinoma in the DMF BID group; breast cancer and cervix cancer in 
the DMF TID group; and cervix cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, and basal cell skin carcinoma 
in the GA group. One case of breast cancer was reported in a subject treated with DMF for 11 months 
during Study C-1900. 
The long-term risk for malignancies with DMF treatment has been further assessed in Study 109MS303, 
with the overall incidence being 3% and the lack of a specific malignancy pattern. Additional analyses 
on  malignancies  and  background 
rates  have  been 
requested 
in 
the  ongoing  variation 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G with focus on skin cancers, which should be addressed in the upcoming 
PSUR (submission date 24 June 2021). This procedure is ongoing (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010143/202103) 
at  the  time  of  this  assessment.  Depending  on  the  outcome,  amendments  to  the  product  information 
might  become  necessary,  which  would  then  also  be  relevant  for  the  DRF  product  information.  The 
applicant’s request to remove malignancies from the list of potential risks associated with Tecfidera in 
the RMP was not deemed acceptable until results from the observational Study 109MS401 (a PASS study) 
become available.  
Liver injury 
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important identified risk with DRF in line with DMF in the respective 
RMPs.  
TEAEs  of  increases  in  liver  transaminases  were  reported  in  Phase 3  studies  A301  and  A302.  None  of 
these increases were associated with increases in bilirubin (no reports of Hy’s law). The incidence of liver 
injury AESIs was low across groups in both studies. Less than 1% of all DRF–treated patients in either 
study had liver function tests > 5x ULN or > 10x upper limit normal (ULN). 
In study A301, TEAEs in the liver injury category were reported in 7.2% of subjects. The most commonly 
reported  liver  injury  events  were  ALT  increased  (5.5%)  and  AST  increased  (2.9%).  All  other  events 
(Preferred Terms [PTs]: liver function tests (LFT) increased, blood bilirubin increased, hepatic enzyme 
increased, blood ALP increased, transaminases increased, urobilinogen urine increased, cholestatic liver 
injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatosplenomegaly) were each reported in ≤ 0.5% of subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 100/148 
 
 
 
The mean (SD) time to onset of events was 139.1 (186.65) days (median: 30 days), with a majority of 
them having occurred in the first six months of treatment. Most of the TEAEs in the liver injury category 
were mild or moderate, and the majority (82.9% of patients) resolved. Liver injury events were assessed 
as related to DRF in a majority of subjects. Seven subjects had AEs related liver function parameters 
leading to treatment discontinuation. Three TEAEs (LFT increased, ALT increased, and cholestatic liver 
injury)  were assessed  as  serious.  For SAEs  of LFT increased  and  ALT  increased,  study  treatment  was 
withdrawn, and the events resolved. The SAE of cholestatic liver injury resolved with sequelae. 
In Study A302, 5.4% of subjects reported at least 1 TEAE in the liver injury AESI category, with a similar 
incidence in the two treatment groups (DRF 5.9% and DMF 4.8%). The most frequently reported TEAEs 
were ALT increased (4.6% of all subjects) and AST increased (2.8% of all subjects); the majority of the 
events were mild or moderate in severity. Two severe TEAEs of ALT increased were reported, each by 
one subject in the DRF and in the DMF group, and two severe TEAEs of AST increased were reported, 
both by subjects in the DRF group. The majority of liver injury events were considered possibly, probably, 
or  definitely  related  to  treatment  by  the  Investigator,  and  approximately  half  of  the  events  remained 
unresolved by the end of the study. There were no discontinuations due to events of liver injury, and 
none of the events was serious. 
The  incidences  and  the  time  course  for  liver  injury  AESI  for  DRF  are  basically  in  line  with  results  for 
hepatic disorder events reported in DMF clinical Pools A and B. In Pool A, the incidence of hepatic TEAEs 
was similar across treatment groups (9% placebo vs. 9% DMF BID and 10% DMF TID) and headed by 
elevations of liver transaminases. These were ALT increased (5% placebo vs. 6% DMF BID and TID), 
AST  increased  (2%  placebo  vs.  4%  DMF  BID  and  TID),  gamma-glutamyltransferase  (GGT)  increased 
(2% placebo vs. 3% DMF BID and 2% DMF TID), and hepatic enzyme increased (1% placebo vs. <1% 
DMF BID and 1% DMF TID). Serious hepatic AEs were reported for two placebo-treated patients (hepatic 
enzyme  increased),  in  one  female  subject  (cholestatic  hepatitis),  and  in  another  unspecified  subject 
(cholelithiasis) both receiving DMF BID. Hepatic events leading to treatment discontinuation were low 
(<1%) and similar in all groups.  
To conclude, the risk of liver injury in patients treated with DRF is in line with DMF. Adequate wording 
has been implemented in the SmPC in line with Tecfidera. 
Renal injury 
The kidney was identified as the target organ of DMF toxicity from the DMF nonclinical programme. Renal 
findings from the DRF nonclinical programme are consistent with those observed in the DMF nonclinical 
programme.  Proteinuria  is  a  common  ADR  with  DMF  and  likewise  included  in  Section  4.8  of  the  DRF 
SmPC.  
In Study A301, 7.8% of subjects had TEAEs from the renal and urinary disorders SOC.  
Mild  or  moderate,  non-serious  AEs  within  the  renal  injury  AESI  category  were  experienced  by  3.4% 
(36/1057) of subjects, with proteinuria being the most common event (1.3%), followed by haematuria 
(0.9%), and GFR decreased (0.9%). The majority of the events were assessed as not related to DRF (in 
19  of  36  subjects).  No  serious  or  fatal  renal  injury  events  were  reported.  One  AE  each  of  glomerular 
filtration rate decreased and renal impairment resulted in study discontinuation. The mean (SD) time to 
onset of the renal injury events in Study A301 was 249.4 days (224.15 days). The time to onset of the 
TEAEs  in  the  renal  injury  AESI  category  varied  with  a  majority  being  reported  within  12 months  of 
treatment start. At the clinical cut-off date, renal injury events were reported as resolved in a majority 
of subjects (29 of 36). 
In Study A302, a total of 1.6% (8/504) of subjects reported at least one AE in the renal injury category 
with similar incidence between the DRF and DMF groups (1.2% and 2%), headed by proteinuria (0.8% 
and 1.2%), haematuria (one subject in each group; 0.4%), and albumin urine present (one subject in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 101/148 
 
 
 
the DMF group). The events of proteinuria were mild in severity; were considered by the Investigator as 
definitely  not  (1  event),  possibly  (2  events),  or  probably  (2  events)  related  to  treatment;  and  4  of  5 
events  were  not  resolved  by  the  end  of  the  study.  None  of  these  AESIs  was  serious  or  led  to  study 
discontinuation.  
In the DMF clinical programme, the incidences of AEs belonging to renal and urinary disorders SOC in 
Pool A were similar in DMF-treated subjects compared to placebo (18% placebo vs. 19% DMF BID and 
22% DMF TID). The most common TEAEs were proteinuria (placebo 7% and DMF BID 9%), haematuria 
(placebo 4% and DMF BID 4%), microalbuminuria (placebo 3% and DMF BID 5%), and albumin urine 
present (3% placebo and 6% DMF BID). The latter is a “common” ADR for DMF and likewise included in 
the SmPC for DRF. Most of the events were rated as mild or moderate in severity, were dose-related, 
and  resolved.  Treatment  discontinuations  due  to  these  events  were  low  (<  1%  in  all  groups).  The 
incidence of serious renal and urinary TEAEs was low (< 1% in all groups), and no serious AE of renal 
failure was reported.  
Subjects in the DMF Phase 3 studies, who developed pre-specified abnormal urine laboratory values were 
examined by a nephrologist (16% placebo vs. 20% DMF BID and TID, 21% GA). Most of the subjects 
did not have a renal dysfunction prior to dosing (93% to 96% across groups). No DMF-treated subject 
had new or worsening renal function post-dosing. There was no evidence of drug-induced nephrotoxicity 
in DMF-treated subjects according to the nephrologist consultation.  
However,  results  of  a  subgroup  analysis  within  the  placebo-controlled  DMF  studies  demonstrated  an 
increased  incidence  of  renal  and  urinary  AEs  (primarily  proteinuria)  in  subjects  with  concomitant 
potentially  nephrotoxic  medication  compared  with  subjects  without  such  medication.  Therefore, 
interaction with nephrotoxic medications leading to renal toxicity is listed as an important potential risk 
in the RMP for DRF in line with DMF. 
A  review  of  laboratory  data  in  Pool  A  revealed  no  notable  differences  between  the  placebo  and  DMF 
groups  in  any  kidney  function  test.  Urinalysis  results  and  urinary  β2-microglobulin  or  microalbumin 
results  were  likewise  not  significantly  different  between  DMF  and  placebo  (see  section  “Laboratory 
findings”). Moreover, subjects who continued on DMF for more than two years in Pool B had no clinically 
relevant changes in renal function tests or urinalyses and no worsening/ progression in β2-microglobulin 
or microalbumin. 
Cardiac disorders 
Cardiac disorders were considered an AESI because of findings of myocardial infarction with fumaric acid 
esters as well as nonclinical (rat) cardiac findings of necrosis and inflammation for DRF, which are rather 
considered a rat-specific finding (reference is made to the nonclinical part of this document). Subjects 
with significant cardiovascular conditions were excluded from the DRF and DMF clinical studies.  
In the Phase 1 studies, cardiac disorder TEAEs were mainly palpitations and extrasystoles. In addition, 
events of presyncope, tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and dizziness (only in DMF groups) were reported. 
No new concern is to be raised from healthy volunteer studies with DRF.  
In Study A301, 6% of subjects were included despite having a medical history of cardiac disorders. 
In  Study  A301,  13.4%  (142/1057)  of  subjects  experienced  AEs  within  the  cardiac  disorders  AESI 
category with a slightly higher reporting in the DMF rollover group (16.9%) than in the de novo and DRF 
rollover groups (11.8% and 14.2%, respectively). Most AESIs were mild or moderate, 0.6% of subjects 
reported  severe  AESIs.  The  majority  (63.4%)  had  an  outcome  of  recovered/resolved  with  continued 
treatment. 
Nonspecific  dizziness  was  the  most  frequently  reported  event  (by  5.4%  of  subjects).  Other  cardiac 
disorder  events  included  oedema  peripheral  (1.5%),  dyspnoea  (1.2%),  syncope  (0.9%),  chest 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 102/148 
 
 
 
discomfort and tachycardia (0.8% each), palpitations (0.7%), atrioventricular block first degree (0.7%), 
and chest pain and peripheral swelling (0.5% each). One event each of hypertensive heart disease and 
cardiac arrest with fatal outcome were assessed as severe SAEs and not related to study treatment (see 
section on “deaths” in this report). Other SAEs reported in the cardiac disorders category were ventricular 
extrasystoles,  cardiac  failure,  stress  cardiomyopathy,  and  myocardial  infarction;  all  these  SAEs  were 
assessed as not related to study treatment and had an outcome of resolved/recovered at the time of the 
data  cut-off.  One  event  each  of  cardiac  arrest,  dyspnoea,  and  myocardial  infarction  led  to  study 
treatment discontinuation. 
In Study A302, AESI in the cardiac disorders category were reported in 3.0% (15/504) of subjects with 
similar incidences in both groups (DRF: 2.8%, DMF: 3.2%). The most common cardiac disorder AE was 
dizziness (in 1.4% of total subjects, 2.0% on DRF and 0.8% on DMF). All other TEAEs were reported in 
single subjects only. None of the cardiac disorder-related AESIs led to study discontinuation. Most events 
in both groups were mild (DRF group) or mild to moderate (DMF group). One event of atrial fibrillation 
was a SAE (rated as probably not related to DRF). One subject in the DRF group interrupted treatment 
due to an event of pulmonary congestion (probably not related to DRF). 
In the DMF clinical studies, incidences for cardiac disorder events were similar for all treatment groups 
(5% to 6%). Incidences for ischemic CV events were small and similar across groups (≤ 1%). Serious 
cardiac disorder events were not reported for placebo or DMF BID. Pooled analysis using pivotal DMF 
studies  109MS301  and  109MS302  to  further  investigate  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  events  under  DMF 
treatment  in  relation  to  existing  cardiovascular  risk  factors  at  baseline  did  not  reveal  a  higher  risk  in 
patients  treated  with  DMF  compared  to  placebo.  The  overall  numbers  of  events  were  similar  in  all 
treatment  and  dosing  groups  except  for  a  slightly  higher  AE  rate  for  tachycardia  and  palpitations  in 
subjects  with  risk  factors  at  baseline.  In  addition,  ECG  changes  were  low  and  similar  in  all  treatment 
groups. In the extension Study 109MS303 (up to 12 years of treatment with DMF), 23 subjects (1%) 
had an ischemic cardiovascular disorder event. 
Gastrointestinal tolerability events 
The  GI  tolerability  AESI  category  in  DRF  Phase 3  studies  included  only  those  events  among  specified 
search criteria that were SAEs and TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation. 
In study A301, GI-related TEAEs were among the most commonly reported TEAEs (31.6%), but GI SAEs 
(ten subjects, 0.9%) and GI events leading to study discontinuation (seven subjects, 0.7%) occurred in 
few subjects only. eight of the 17 subjects with SAEs and AEDC captured in the GI disorders SOC (five 
subjects with SAEs and three subjects with AEDCs) met the specified search criteria for AESI (0.8% of 
all subjects). Abdominal pain and diarrhoea were reported in three subjects each, followed by gastritis 
(two subjects), and chronic gastritis and vomiting (one subject each). Time to onset of the TEAEs in the 
GI tolerability category varied substantially (ranging from 4 days to 547 days); in six of eight subjects, 
GI events were reported within the first nine months of treatment. TEAEs associated with GI tolerability 
were  mild  and  moderate  in  one  and  four  subjects,  respectively,  and  severe  in  three  subjects,  and  all 
were recovered/resolved by the data cut-off. All but one (one subject with vomiting and abdominal pain) 
GI tolerability events were assessed as related to DRF. 
In Study A302, a direct comparison of GI tolerability in patients treated with either DRF or DMF was the 
primary objective. A total of 2.8% (14/504) of subjects reported at least one GI tolerability AESI, 4.8% 
of subjects in the DMF group, and 0.8% of subjects in the DRF group. None of these AESIs were SAEs, 
but  all  led  to  study  discontinuation,  and  most  of  them  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  The  three 
severe events (two events of abdominal pain and one event of abdominal pain upper) all occurred in the 
DMF group. The two AESI of GI tolerability in the DRF group were diarrhoea and vomiting, which were 
mild and moderate in intensity and related to DRF. In the DMF group, abdominal pain upper was the 
leading cause of discontinuation (2.0% of patients). The majority of these events were mild or moderate

in  severity  and  considered  as  related  to  the  treatment.  The  outcome  of  all  events  was  considered 
recovered/resolved. Other GI AESIs leading to discontinuation experienced by ≥ 2 subjects in the DMF 
group included diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. 
In the DMF Pool A, TEAEs associated with GI tolerability in DMF-treated subjects were more frequently 
reported  compared  with  placebo  (40%  DMF  BID  vs.  31%  placebo).  Frequently  reported  PTs  were 
diarrhoea,  nausea,  abdominal  pain  upper,  abdominal  pain,  and  vomiting.  GI  disorders  leading  to 
treatment discontinuations were reported in 4% and 6% of patients in the DMF BID and TID group. The 
time course for GI tolerability events was highest during the first month and declined during the second 
month  and  thereafter.  Serious  GI  AEs  (most  common  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  and  gastritis)  were 
reported in up to 1% of subjects across treatment groups. 
Data  on  gastrointestinal  tolerability  with  DRF  do  not  indicate  relevant  differences  compared  to  those 
reported in the pivotal DMF clinical studies. The results of the primary endpoint analysis are considered 
debatable  given  that  these  are  based  on  GI  scales  that  have  not  been  validated,  the  choice  of  the 
endpoint is questionable and an anticipated lack of statistical robustness. As such, referencing product-
specific data on DRF  in Section 4.8 is dispensable and information should rely on the Tecfidera pivotal 
experience,  which  is  considered  conservative.  Upon  discussion  of  the  mechanism  underlying  the 
proposed increase in GI tolerability of DRF compared with DMF, there is no evidence to support that any 
of the presented mechanisms (i.e. the lower concentration of methanol formed, the larger particle size 
of  DRF  limiting  binding  to  receptors  within  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  the  lower  electrophilicity  of 
DRF) are important in the hypothesised better tolerance of DRF.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths: 
In the DRF programme, four SAEs with fatal outcome were reported, all of which occurred in Study A301 
as of the clinical cut-off date. Three events occurred in de novo subjects: 
- fall in a subject (age 20 to30 years) with DRF for 213 days and no relevant medical history was 
assessed as not related to DRF; the conditions that led to the subject's death were shock and 
multiple bone fractures with internal organ damage, intention unspecified. 
- “hypertensive heart disease” with fatal outcome in a subject (age 50 to 60 years) with DRF for 
> 250 days and relevant medical history, including hyperlipidaemia, asthma, and hypertension 
was assessed as not related to DRF. 
-  “pneumonia  bacterial”  in  a  subject  (age  30  to  40  years)  with  DRF  for  >  500  days  without 
relevant medical history that led to acute respiratory failure and the subject's death, which was 
assessed as not related to DRF. No other relevant abnormalities were reported. 
One subject (40 to 50 years) with DRF for > 75 days in the DRF rollover group died from a cardiac arrest 
(assessed as probably not related to DRF) without relevant medical history or other confounding factors. 
ECG parameters obtained before the fatal event (in A302 and in A301) were unremarkable. 
A total of 16 deaths have been reported in the DMF clinical development programme with seven of them 
reported at the time of MAA submission of Tecfidera (cut off 03 August 2011). Five deaths belonged to 
the DMF groups, one to the placebo group (ischemic stroke), and one to the GA group (suicide).  
The five deaths in subjects on DMF occurred due to a traumatic brain injury from a bicycle accident, a 
road  traffic  accident,  complications  of  an  MS  relapse  (in  the  controlled  studies),  a  MS  relapse  and 
cardiopulmonary arrest related to paraplegia and respiratory muscle weakness, and suicide (both in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 104/148 
 
 
 
uncontrolled Study 109MS303). None of these deaths was considered related to treatment with dimethyl 
fumarate.  
A total of 11 deaths were reported during Study 109MS303 with nine of them between the interim (03 
August 2011) and final data cut-off (08 November 2019) due to adenocarcinoma of the lung, terminal 
cardio respiratory arrest due to type I respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, thrombotic emboli 
in pulmonary artery, complication MS, suicide (unlikely related), cardiac arrest, mesothelioma, aspiration 
pneumonia (in a patient with ongoing PML; rated as related to DMF), and malignant disease. 
Serious adverse events 
No SAEs were reported in any of the Phase 1 studies with DRF. 
In Study A301, SAEs were reported by 11.4% (n= 120) of subjects, 11.6% in the De Novo group, and 
11.7% and 10.2% in the DRF and DMF rollover group, respectively. Of the 120 subjects with SAEs, 61 
had SAEs of MS relapse during the Treatment Period. The majority of cases occurred in non-US countries 
where  MS  relapse  is  commonly  treated  in  a  hospital  setting,  which  defines  the  cases  as  serious.  The 
other  SAEs  occurring  in  more  than  one  subject  were  abdominal  pain  (three  subjects),  gastritis, 
cholecystitis,  inguinal  hernia,  appendicitis,  fall,  uterine  leiomyoma,  suicidal  ideation,  and  respiratory 
failure (two subjects each). Ten SAEs were considered related to study treatment by the Investigator 
(four of ten SAEs were from the GI disorders SOC). 
In Study A302, SAEs were reported in a total 1.4% of subjects (1.6% of patients in the DRF group and 
1.2%  of  subjects  in  the  DMF  group);  all  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  treatment  and  were 
resolved or resolved with sequelae by the end of the study. In the DRF group, SAEs reported were atrial 
fibrillation (1 patient), MS relapse (two subjects), and MS relapse/suicide attempt (one subject); in the 
DMF  group,  SAEs  reported  were  MS  relapse  (two  subjects)  and  cholecystitis  (one  subject).  One  SAE 
(suicide attempt in the DRF group) led to discontinuation from the study. 
SAEs  in  DMF  studies  occurred  with  a  slightly  lower  incidence  in  DMF-treated  subjects  compared  to 
placebo (16% vs. 21%). MS relapse was the most frequently mentioned SAE (9% DMF vs. 14% placebo). 
SAEs related to GI disorders and flushing did not exceed a 1% incidence in any treatment group. Serious 
flushing  events  occurred  in  a  low  number  in  DMF-treated  subjects  (<  1%  each).  Three  out  of  2,560 
subjects  in  DMF  clinical  trials  experienced  serious  flushing  symptoms  that  were  in  line  with 
hypersensitivity  or  anaphylactoid  reactions.  These  events  were  not  life  threatening  but  led  to 
hospitalisation.  Cases  of  anaphylaxis/  anaphylactoid  reaction  have  likewise  been  reported  following 
Tecfidera  administration  in  the  post-marketing  setting.  The  mechanism  of  dimethyl  fumarate  induced 
anaphylaxis is unknown. Detailed information is presented in Section 4.4 of the Tecfidera SmPC. 
SAEs during the extension Study 109MS303 were reported in 551 subjects (32%). The SOCs with the 
highest incidence of SAEs were nervous system disorders (16%), and infections and infestations (5%). 
In total, the most frequent SAE by PT was MS relapse (14%). Serious treatment-related AEs occurred in 
4% of subjects in the study. All treatment-related SAEs by PT occurred in less than 1% of subjects. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters 
The predominant findings in pivotal studies with DMF were a reduction in mean leukocyte (WBC) and 
lymphocyte  counts  from  baseline,  roughly  starting  at  Week  4  through  Week  48,  with  a  plateau  up  to 
Week 96 compared to placebo, but remained above lower limit of normal (LLN) at all time points. Mean 
reduction for WBC counts and lymphocytes was 11% and 30%, respectively, up to Week 48. There was 
no  further  worsening  up  to  3.5  years  of  treatment.  Consistent  with  these  findings,  decreases  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 105/148 
 
 
 
lymphocyte  and  leukocyte  counts  starting  at  Week  4  through  Week  48  and  a  plateau  up  to  Week  96 
were noted for DRF with identical mean decreases from baseline to Week 48.  
Shift analyses in Study A301 confirmed these findings and were found similar to DMF clinical studies: 
the  most  common  shifts  (≥  10%  of  subjects)  from  normal/high  baseline  to  low  were  observed  for 
lymphocytes  (39.8%  of  subjects),  erythrocytes  (30.7%  of  subjects),  leukocytes  (27.8%  of  subjects), 
and neutrophils (16.8% of subjects). The most common shifts from normal/low baseline to high were 
found  for  neutrophils  (20.7%  of  subjects),  and  leukocytes  (13.8%  of  subjects).  PCS  haematology 
parameters of lymphocytes < 0.5 × 109/L, neutrophils, absolute < 1.5 × 109/L, and leukocytes ≤ 2.8 
× 109/L were observed in 8.9%, 5.9%, and 7.2% of subjects.  
42.4%  of  subjects  had  lymphocyte  counts  below  LLN  (<  0.91x109/L)  and  lymphopenia  was  mainly 
reported as moderate (Grade 2, in 22.6% of subjects). In 13.7% of all subjects (143 of 1045), moderate 
lymphopenia was prolonged for at least six months, i.e., 13.7% of de novo subjects, 16% of subjects 
treated with DRF and 11.1% of subjects treated with DMF. An obviously higher number of subjects with 
lymphopenia  and  moderate  prolonged  lymphopenia  for  ≥  6  months  reported  in  the  DFR  groups  as 
compared to the DMF rollover group is not based on a biological mechanism since lymphopenia is thought 
to  be  an  MMF-mediated  effect.  The  difference  might  be  attributed  to  the  overall  shorter  treatment 
duration with DMF and the fact that lymphopenia does not tend to occur during the first five weeks of 
treatment with DMF. Grade 3 lymphopenia was experienced by 10.5% and 8.9% of subjects from the 
DRF  and  DMF  group,  respectively  (rollover  subjects).  Severe  prolonged  lymphopenia  (absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC) < 0.5x109/L for at least six months) has not been reported in A301 given that 
patients  with  lymphocyte  counts  <  0.5x109/L  for  ≥  4  weeks  had  to  discontinue  DRF  according  to  the 
protocol.  Follow-up  LM  revealed  that  the  number  of  subjects  with  lymphopenia  declined  during  a 
maximum follow-up period of six months (three LM visits). Nevertheless, at LM Visit 3, 18 subjects still 
had Grade 2 or 3 lymphopenia. 
Analyses of pivotal DMF studies demonstrated slight recovery of lymphocytes four weeks post dose (after 
study treatment discontinuation or completion). Nevertheless, these data were considered inconclusive 
given the short follow-up period. Lymphocyte recovery after stopping DMF treatment was also evaluated 
in 109MS303. In subjects with ALC < LLN at recovery baseline and with ALC < 0.8x109/L at recovery 
baseline, lymphocyte recovery to ≥ LLN within the follow-up period (up to 48 weeks) was observed in 
more than half of these subjects. Using a linear mixed-effect model, the estimated time to reconstitution 
to ALC > LLN in patients with ALC < LLN was 4.7 weeks. These data did not include subjects with severe 
prolonged  lymphopenia  (i.e.,  ALC  <  0.5x109/L  for  more  than  six  months).  A  number  of  uncertainties 
have  been  identified  for  the  datasets  and  statistical  analysis  underlying  this  evaluation  (reference  is 
made  to  the  ongoing  procedure  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G).  Given  that  lymphocyte  count 
reconstitution data are proposed to be included in Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPCs for DMF and DRF, 
these  discrepancies  have  to  be  solved  in  advance,  which  has  been  confirmed  by  the  applicant.  Until 
agreement on a wording, inclusion in the Vumerity SmPC seems dispensable, which has been agreed to 
by the applicant. 
In the DMF Pool A, a transient increase in mean values for eosinophils was reported in the first 2 months 
of treatment with DMF. In Study A302, there were increases seen in eosinophil counts both for DMF and 
DRF and transient increase in mean eosinophil counts was likewise observed in de novo subjects in study 
A301.  
There were no other clinically meaningful findings in the haematology results in Study A302. 
Chemistry parameters 
No clinically significant changes from baseline in chemistry parameters were noted in Phase 1 studies in 
healthy volunteers or in the Phase 3 Study A302. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 106/148 
 
 
 
There were no clinically meaningful mean changes from baseline in serum chemistry parameters in Study 
A301,  including  metabolic  parameters,  electrolytes,  and  creatine  kinase.  Laboratory  parameters  were 
not specifically taken in fasting condition; thus, variability is to be expected. Small mean increases from 
baseline were noted for blood calcium and sodium in all treatment groups. Individual metabolic subject 
changes were similar across groups and included  shifts from normal/low to high in glucose and high-
density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholesterol,  and  shifts  from  normal/  high  to  low  in  cholesterol,  low-density 
lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  The  most  frequently  reported  individual  change  in 
electrolytes concerned normal/ low to high potassium in 8.7% of patients. 6.0% of subjects reported a 
PCS change in potassium (>5.5mmol/L). 
Findings were in overall accordance with those in the DMF clinical programme. Special blood chemistry 
tests only conducted in pivotal DMF studies included parathyroid hormone and Vitamin D levels, which 
were monitored in order to substantiate preclinical findings in rats with renal failure. Studies 109MS301 
and  109MS302  showed  increased  mean  parathyroid  hormone  levels  from  Week 48  to  Week 96  and 
decreased Vitamin D levels (-20% of baseline values) in DMF-treated subjects compared to placebo. No 
such data are available for DRF. 
Urinalysis 
There  were  no  clinically  significant  findings  for  urinalysis  parameters  in  DRF  studies,  including  nine 
Phase 1 studies in HV. In Study A108 (subjects with renal impairment), abnormal postbaseline urinalysis 
results  were  observed  most  frequently  in  the  severe  renal  impairment  group  and  already  present  at 
baseline. The most frequently mentioned abnormality was protein urine (37.5%).  
In A301, there were no clinically relevant differences across treatment groups in patients with abnormal 
urinalysis  parameters  (urine  pH,  specific  gravity,  ketones,  protein,  glucose,  bilirubin,  nitrite, 
urobilinogen, occult blood, albumin/creatinine, and β2-microglobulin). Abnormal urinalysis parameters 
were most frequently reported for urine protein, urine ketones and urine occult blood (in 76.6%, 55.3%, 
and  37.4%  of  all  subjects)  and  similar  across  treatment  groups  without  affecting  renal  function. 
Abnormal urinalysis results did not correspond with the incidence of renal TEAEs.  
A  PCS  abnormal  value  for  β2-microglobulin  defined  as  >  0.300 mg/L  (early  marker  of  renal  tubular 
damage)  was  reported  in  15.3%  of  subjects.  2.1%  of  patients  reported  a  TEAE  of  increased 
ß2-microglobulin  in  urine.  A  similar  percentage  of  subjects  reported  TEAEs  in  line  with  microalbumin 
(increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio; 2.8%). The incidences of these TEAEs correspond with 
results from ß2-microglobulin and microalbumin monitoring during DMF studies: more than 95% [85%] 
of  subjects  had  ß2-microglobulin  [microalbumin]  values  within  the  normal  range  (≤0.29  mg/L)  [≤1.8 
mg/dL]  at  baseline  and  subsequent  time  points.  Subjects,  whose  ß2-microglobulin  or  microalbumin 
values exceeded the normal range, remained on these values throughout the study. A similar incidence 
of  shifts  to  high  urine  β2-microglobulin  was  observed  across  the  placebo,  DMF  BID  and  TID,  and  GA 
groups (9% to 10%, each group) based on pooled data from Studies 301 and 302. Shifts to high in urine 
microalbumin were higher in the DMF BID and TID groups (36% and 37%, respectively) when compared 
to  placebo  (29%)  and  GA  (33%).  No  significant  changes  in  β2-microglobulin  and  microalbumin  were 
noted across treatment groups and over time (through 3.5 years) providing some reassurance that renal 
tubular  damage  is  not  an  issue  in  the  majority  of  DMF-treated  subjects.  Moreover,  during  the  entire 
duration  of  Study  109MS303,  the  majority  of  subjects  remained  on  normal  levels  of  urine  β-2 
microglobulin and urine microalbumin. 
In Study A302, abnormal urinalysis parameters and PCS abnormalities were likewise reported but with 
lower incidences due to the shorter treatment duration and similar across treatment groups. 
In the DMF clinical programme, the percentage of subjects with two positive urinalyses for protein was 
lowest  for  placebo  (47%)  and  highest  for  GA  (56%),  and  51%  for  DMF  BID.  There  was  no  relevant 
Assessment report

difference  with  regard  to  two  consecutively  positive  findings  of  proteinuria  on  urinalysis,  and  in  the 
incidence of urinalysis with 3+ or 4+ protein in the different treatment groups. 
Elevated urine ketones were reported for DMF-treated subjects compared to placebo and GA: 21% DMF 
BID, 5% placebo, and 4% GA. Shifts to high/positive values in the DMF BID group was 63% compared 
to 26% placebo for urine ketones. 
Liver function 
In the DRF clinical Phase 1 studies, there were no clinically meaningful or numerically significant changes 
observed  for  ALT,  AST,  albumin,  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP),  bilirubin,  total  protein,  lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), or GGT in healthy volunteers or in those with renal impairment in Study A108. 
In  the  DRF  clinical  Phase 3  studies,  transient  mean  increases  in  liver  transaminases  were  reported 
typically within the first four weeks of treatment, and in a majority of subjects, increases were in line 
with values of ALT and/ or AST ≤ 3x ULN. PCS abnormalities of higher degrees (i.e., > 3x ULN, > 5x 
ULN, and > 10x ULN) occurred in no more than 2% of subjects and - as expected - given the onset of 
liver enzyme increases, more pronounced in the de novo group.  
Mean increases in ALT and AST in Study A302 have been observed shortly after treatment initiation up 
to Week 3 with a subsequent plateau  up to the last assessment in the treatment period. While mean 
changes  were  almost  identical  for  DRF  and  DMF,  slightly  more  subjects  on  DRF  than  on  DMF  were 
reported to have shifts from normal/ low at baseline to high post-baseline (ALT: 25.9% vs. 16.4%; AST: 
15.8% vs. 9%). However, most of the elevations were < 3x ULN; therefore, this rather small difference 
between groups at the expense of DRF is not considered clinically relevant. Moreover, any post-baseline 
abnormal  liver  function  tests  and  PCS  values  of  higher  degrees  for  ALT  and  AST  were  found  slightly 
higher in patients on DMF as compared to DRF. No concern is to be raised for other liver parameters, 
i.e. ALP, bilirubin, or LDH.  
None of the patients in either DRF study experienced liver enzyme increases in line with Hy’s law (total 
bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN and ALT or AST ≥ 3x ULN). Liver enzyme changes were also not associated with an 
increase in clinically significant liver disease. 
In the DMF clinical programme (Pool A), hepatic transaminases ALT and AST increased in DMF BID and 
TID-treated subjects compared to placebo, with a peak at Week 4 with mean ALT exceeding the ULN for 
DMF TID. Both transaminases returned to baseline values around Week 32. ALT and AST maximum post-
baseline values were in a majority of patients < 3x ULN (in more than 90% of subjects) and similar low 
proportions in the DMF and placebo group as well as in the GA group had values ≥ 3x ULN. Maximum 
post-baseline values > 10x ULN or > 20x ULN were of rare incidence (≤ 1%). Liver enzyme increases in 
line with Hy`s law were not reported in the DMF clinical programme. 
Most  subjects  had  maximum  post-baseline  total  bilirubin  levels  of  ≤  1x  ULN  (90%  to  93%  across 
treatment groups) and 7% to 10% of subjects across treatment groups had values of > 1x ULN. Similar 
and stable values were reported for long-term treatment in Pool B. 
Renal function 
Renal function was regularly assessed in the DRF clinical programme.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes observed in renal parameters in any of the Phase 1 studies 
in  healthy  volunteers.  Two  subjects  from  the  renal  impairment  Phase 1  Study  A108  (one  from  the 
moderate and one from the severe impairment cohort) were reported with PCS high BUN (> 30 mg/dL) 
and with PCS high BUN (> 30 mg/dL) and creatinine (≥ 2 mg/dL). 
There  was  no  evidence  for  an  impaired  renal  function  with  DRF  treatment  in  Studies A301  and  A302 
based  on  mean  renal  parameter  values  over  time  for  albumin,  creatinine,  urate,  BUN  or  glomerular 
Assessment report

filtration rate. Moreover, no clinically relevant results on renal function derived from shift analyses and 
potentially clinically significant abnormalities in the phase 3 studies and results were similar for and DMF 
in A302.  
During  the  DMF  clinical  development  programme,  intensive  monitoring  of  kidney  function  was 
undertaken.  Laboratory  evaluation  revealed  no  clinically  notable  changes  in  mean  values  for  BUN  or 
creatinine over time for DMF BID and TID groups and no relevant differences from placebo. Mean values 
did not exceed normal ranges at the assessed time points across treatment groups. Shifts to high were 
similar and low for these analytes. 
Vital signs and other observations related to safety 
Evaluation of vital sign parameters included SBP, DBP, HR, RR, temperature, weight, and BMI. 
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs in the DRF clinical studies: in study A301, PCS 
vital sign values (i.e., systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate) were reported in 
less than 2% of all subjects and similar across treatment groups. Data from Study A302 were in support 
of these results. There was no clinically significant difference in any of the vital signs or change in body 
weight  described  for  DMF,  placebo,  or  GA-treated  subjects  during  the  DMF  clinical  programme.  The 
Tecfidera product information does not mention ADRs or warnings related to vital signs. 
There was no safety issue associated with ECG measurements in the Phase 1 studies. 
In  the  TQT  study  (Study  ALK8700-A110),  multiple  doses  of  therapeutic  (462 mg  BID)  and 
supratherapeutic  (924 mg  BID)  oral  DRF  doses  did  not  cause  QTcF  prolongation  exceeding  10msec. 
Additionally, up to the supratherapeutic dose, DRF did not have a clinically relevant effect on heart rate, 
PR interval, QRS interval, T-wave morphology, or U-wave presence. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends or changes from baseline for ECG measurements in subjects 
treated with DRF in A301 or within or between DRF or DMF treatment groups for ECG measurements in 
A302. TEAEs related to ECG findings in A301 were reported in few subjects only with the most frequently 
mentioned  TEAEs  being  tachycardia  (0.8%),  palpitations  (0.7%),  AV  block  first  degree  (0.7%), 
ventricular extrasystoles (0.4%), and bundle branch block right (0.3%). The events of cardiac arrest, 
cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, stress cardiomyopathy, ventricular extrasystoles, and hypertensive 
heart disease were considered SAEs. The event of hypertensive heart disease in a patient with a number 
of medical conditions (including hypercholesterolemia) was fatal and was judged definitely not related 
to study treatment. 
During the DMF clinical programme, ECGs were performed at baseline and at 12-week intervals through 
Week 48 in Study C-1900, and at baseline and every 24 weeks in Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. 
There were no relevant changes in QTc interval or any other quantitative or qualitative ECG parameters. 
Suicidality assessments (C-SSRS) were included in DRF studies because the compound is administered 
to  a  patient  population  with  a  neurologic  disorder  with  an  increased  prevalence  of  depression  and  an 
elevated  risk  of  suicide.  Data  from  the  DRF  clinical  programme  do  not  indicate  an  increased  risk  for 
suicidality with DRF (or DMF) treatment. Single events of suicidal ideation were reported in study A302 
in both treatment groups post-baseline and one subject in the DRF group with relevant medical history 
experienced a SAE of suicide attempt. In Study A301, an increase of suicidal ideation post-baseline over 
baseline was reported (2.1% vs. 0.2%), which is considered an effect of longer treatment duration in a 
population with an increased prevalence of depression.  
No risk on an increased rate for depression or suicidality was detected in the DMF clinical programme; 
however,  no  dedicated  suicidality  assessment  was  implemented.  Adverse  events  contributing  to 
depression,  suicidal  ideation,  suicide  attempt,  completed  suicide  etc.  occurred  in  a  low  and  similar 
incidence across different treatment groups in DMF Pool A. There was a slight increase in depression for 
Assessment report

DMF-treated subjects in Pool B (2% placebo vs. 7% DMF BID). Serious adverse events with respect to 
depression and suicidal tendencies were rare and balanced across groups. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
Not applicable. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No dedicated DRF clinical study has been performed in special populations with MS.  
Patients  with  significant  cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  gastrointestinal,  dermatologic,  psychiatric, 
neurologic  (other  than  MS),  endocrine,  renal  or  hepatic  conditions,  and/  or  other  major  disease  were 
excluded from the clinical trials. 
The  incidence,  severity,  and  relationship  to  DRF  treatment  of  TEAEs  were  similar  overall  and  across 
treatment  groups  when  analysed  by  intrinsic  (Study  A301)  and  extrinsic  factors  (Studies  A301  and 
A302).  
No patient was younger than 18 years or older than 65 years of age at the time of inclusion in the DRF 
Phase 3 studies. The mean (SD) age of subjects was 42.5 (10.78) years old, with 59.6% being ≥ 40 
years of age. Age did not affect the incidence of TEAEs between the two age groups: TEAEs were reported 
by 88.9% of subjects ≥ 40 years of age and by 84.8% of subjects < 40 years of age. The incidence of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment was slightly higher in subjects ≥ 40 years of age 
compared to subjects < 40 years of age (9.2% vs. 4.7%). Upon request, data has been provided on the 
safety profile in patients ≥ 55 years vs. younger patients, which is considered a relevant information 
given that the applicant claims an age cut-off of 65 years in Section 4.2 of the SmPC (reference is made 
to ”Patient exposure”). The overall safety profile in subjects treated with DRF and aged < 55 years is 
generally  found  in  line  with  that  in  patients  aged  ≥  55  years,  with  adequate  wording  in  place  in 
Section 4.2  of  the  SmPC.  Strikingly,  subjects  with  lymphopenia  TEAEs  and  those  having  discontinued 
DRF due to lymphopenia were found twice as high in the older subgroup. This is in line with scientific 
literature  discussed  during  variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63:  Longbrake  and  co-workers 
(Longbrake EE et al. Mult Scler J Exp Transl Clin. 2015) found that more than 40% of subjects above 55 
years of age develop Grade 2 or 3 lymphocytopenia (probably related to immunosenescence). Due to 
the applied inclusion criteria in the Tecfidera studies, this relation has not and could not be observed. 
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that general immunosenescence at advanced age could lead to a higher 
susceptibility for opportunistic infections in MS patients >50 years.  
Regarding race, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn given that 92.0% of patients were of Caucasian 
origin. 
Otherwise healthy volunteers with no, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were studied in a 
single-dose  Phase  1  study  (A108).  Renal  impairment  had  no  effect  on  the  PK  exposures  of  MMF; 
therefore, dose adjustment is not needed. Exposures to the inactive metabolite HES increased in parallel 
to the severity of renal impairment; however, the safety profile was comparable between subjects with 
renal  impairment  and  HV.  This  is  supported  by  summary  presentation  of  (non-)clinical  data 
demonstrating that HES metabolite is biologically inactive and pharmacologically inert. In study A105, 
no further biotransformation of HES in plasma or urine was reported. Moreover, no clinically meaningful 
findings in renal parameters have been observed in any of ten Phase 1 studies.  
In  Study  A301,  845  subjects  had  normal  eGFR  (≥  90  mL/min/1.73  m2)  and  205  subjects  had  mild 
decrease in eGFR (≥ 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. Evaluation of the safety profile for DRF in

subjects  with  normal  eGFR  and  eGFR  indicative  of  mild  renal  impairment  does  not  suggest  clinically 
significant differences. However, patients were excluded from the Phase 3 studies if they had an eGFR 
≤  60  mL/min/1.73  m2  at  screening  (concerning  seven  subjects  in  Study  A301).  Moreover,  study 
treatment was discontinued following an eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (persisting for more than four 
weeks after previous interruption of treatment). Therefore, no data is available on DRF safety in subjects 
with moderate and/or severe renal impairment, which is a missing information in the RMP.  
A post hoc analysis was also performed on the safety population in 109MS303 (n=1736) to assess the 
incidence  of  TEAEs  and  SAEs  in  subjects  with  normal  GFR  (GFR  ≥  90  mL/min/1.73  m2),  mild  renal 
impairment (GFR < 90 to ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), or moderate to severe renal impairment (GFR < 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. The proportion of patients with a TEAE or SAE during Study 109MS303 
was similar in subjects with a normal GFR and in patients with mild renal impairment at baseline as was 
the most common TEAEs and SAEs. The most common (≥ 15% in either GFR group) TEAEs by PT were 
MS relapse, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, flushing, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, 
back pain, and diarrhoea. The most common (≥ 5% in either  group) treatment-emergent SAE by PT 
was MS relapse in both groups (normal GFR: 205 subjects [15%]; renal impairment: 34 subjects [8%]). 
The overall number of subjects in the post hoc defined group of “moderate to severe renal impairment” 
as per baseline status was low (n= 6 subjects). Therefore, interpretation of TEAEs and SAEs in this group 
needs to be treated with caution. 
DRF has not been administered to MS patients with comorbid liver impairment. Thus, the safety profile 
in patients with hepatic impairment is an area of missing information in the RMP.  
Patients  were  excluded  from  Phase  3  studies  if  they  had  ALT  or  AST  values  ≥  2x  ULN  at  screening. 
Moreover,  patients  who  experienced  liver  enzyme  increases  with  DRF  had  to  discontinue  treatment  if 
ALT or AST values remained > 3x ULN for ≥ 4 weeks (≥ 2 weeks for Study A302). The metabolism of 
DRF  (like  DMF)  does  not  involve  the  CYP  isoenzyme  system;  therefore,  PK  interactions  with 
concomitantly  administered  drugs  and  subsequent  increases  in  exposure  of  MMF  are  not  expected. 
Available and missing data in patients with hepatic impairment is reflected in Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2 
of the SmPC for DRF in line with DMF. 
Evaluation  of  intrinsic  factors  overall  complied  with  information  reported  in  the  Tecfidera  clinical 
programme. 
No new concerns derive from evaluation of region as extrinsic factors with DRF and no such effect was 
observed in the Tecfidera clinical programme based on Pool A data. Some variability in the reporting of 
TEAEs/  SAEs/  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  as  well  as  TEAEs  by  SOC  and  preferred  terms  was 
observed for US versus non-US region, indicative of slightly increased incidences in the US population. 
This  observation  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant  given  that  medical  practice  and  therapeutic 
approaches as well as cultural/ socioeconomic factors are considered to differ. Moreover, in  
Study A302, safety results for DRF and DMF behaved similar with regard to region. 
Neither DRF nor DMF have been studied in pregnant or lactating women.  
Ten pregnancies were reported in the DRF studies, one in the Phase 1 Study A110 and nine pregnancies 
in Study A301 as of the interim data cut of 01 September 2020. DRF was discontinued as per the protocol. 
The outcome was known for eight of the ten pregnancies, including four full-term healthy infants, two 
elective  abortions  (at  eight  and  ten  weeks  of  gestation),  and  two  spontaneous  abortions.  Two 
pregnancies  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut.  The  impact  of  DRF  on  pregnancy  outcomes  is 
proposed to be evaluated in a prospective pregnancy registry cohort study (Study 272MS401) for which 
the  applicant  confirmed  that  a  study  protocol  will  be  submitted  in  a  stand-alone  procedure  (MEA) 
following finalisation of the RMP and approval of the marketing authorisation.  
At  the  time  of  the  MA  of  Tecfidera,  foetal  abnormalities  were  not  observed  in  38  human  pregnancies 
Assessment report

reported in subjects exposed to DMF. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity and Tecfidera is 
not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  appropriate 
contraception. In Study 109MS303, 34 pregnancies were reported as per the data cut-off 08 November 
2019, including a single pregnancy in the partner of a male patient treated with Tecfidera. 68% of all 
reported pregnancies resulted in live births. 4 cases of spontaneous abortion/ undeveloped pregnancy 
(12%)  occurred  at  ≤  15  weeks  gestation  and  two  pregnancies  resulted  in  elective  terminations.  The 
outcome  of  the  two  pregnancies  was  unknown  (lost  to  follow-up).  For  three  cases  (9%)  of  induced 
abortion  due  to  congenital  abnormalities,  the  narratives  were  insufficient  to  rule  out  a  causality  with 
Tecfidera  treatment,  i.e.,  one  case  of  reduction  deformity  of  the  left  upper  limb  lacking  any  genetic 
predisposition (rated as possibly related to Tecfidera) in a young patient; one case of triploidy (rated as 
unlikely related to Tecfidera); one case of trisomy 21 and cardiac failure reported in the foetus (rated as 
not  related  to  Tecfidera).  The  three  cases  of  congenital  abnormalities  exceeded  the  background 
prevalence rate of a reference population in EUROCAT. So far, no immediate action or changes to the 
product information has been anticipated based on these cases and further information is expected from 
a  cumulative  analysis  on  pregnancies  in  the  upcoming  PSUR  (submission  date  24  June  2021,  under 
evaluation in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010143/202103 at the time of this assessment). 
The safety of DRF in paediatric patients has not been established so far. An application for a PIP, including 
a  request  for  deferral  and  a  waiver  for  patients  aged  0  to  10  years,  was  submitted  to  EMA  on  17 
December 2019 and has been agreed upon (EMEA-002685-PIP02-19). 
For DMF, two paediatric studies in patients aged 13 to < 18 years have been conducted, i.e., a 24-week, 
open-label, prospective, uncontrolled study in 22 paediatric subjects with RRMS (109MS202; reference 
is  made  to  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042)  and  its  96-week  extension  (109MS311;  reference  is  made  to 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0059).  These  studies  were  not  part  of  the  PIP  for  DMF.  Based  on  the  limited 
number of paediatric subjects treated with DMF in these two studies, clinical safety appears in line with 
the adult profile. Information deriving from these two small paediatric studies with DMF is not considered 
of  clinical  relevance  for  DRF;  as  such,  references  have  been  agreed  to  be  deleted  in  the  product 
information for DRF. An OL, randomised, multicentre, multiple-dose, active-controlled, parallel group, 
efficacy  and  safety  study  of  BG00012  in  children  from  10  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  with  RRMS 
(109MS306), agreed on in the PIP for Tecfidera (P/0177/2020), has meanwhile been finalised and results 
of this study are assessed in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0073) to support treatment with 
DMF in paediatric patients. 
Experience  with  overdose  in  MS  patients  treated  with  DRF  in  the  Phase  3  studies  is  very  limited.  In 
Studies  A301  and  A302,  one  subject  each  was  reported  to  have  had  a  TEAE  of  overdose.  Accidental 
overdose in the patient from Study A301 was reported as SAE. No cases of overdose have been reported 
in DMF clinical trials. 
No evidence of abuse potential could be demonstrated based on the assessment of pre-defined MedDRA 
search criteria. The overall incidence of TEAEs related to abuse was 7.3% in Study A301, 5.4% of them 
with  rather  unspecific  reports  of  dizziness.  Dizziness  was  likewise  reported  as  TEAE  within  the  AESI 
category of cardiac disorders. No additional concern derives from adherence rates (>100%) evaluated 
in Studies A301 and A302. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Not applicable.

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
With regard to its biotransformation, no CYP interaction and protein binding is expected with DRF in line 
with DMF. In vitro studies demonstrated that MMF, DRF, HES, and RDC-8439 do not inhibit or induce 
CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. A Phase 1 DDI study with digoxin was conducted given 
that DRF showed potential to inhibit P-gp transport in vitro; however, no effect on P-gp transport in vivo 
could be deduced. No unexpected safety issues derived from digoxin administration. 
According to the biotransformation of DMF (hydrolysis to MMF and further transformation through the 
TCA  cycle,  with  exhalation  of  CO2  as  a  major  elimination  route  and  secondary  renal  elimination)  the 
interaction potential seems to be low, especially with respect to CYP interaction and protein binding. No 
systematic DDI study was conducted.  
In Study 109HV106, no new safety signals were detected in 56 healthy volunteers who received repeated 
doses of either DMF (total daily doses ranging from 480 to 720 mg) or placebo with or without ASA for 
four days.  
In  Study  109HV113,  the  safety  profile  of  concurrent  use  of  Ortho  Cyclen  (an  oral  contraceptive  with 
norelgestromin  and  ethinyl  oestradiol)  and  DMF  was  consistent  with  that  observed  for  DMF.  The 
coadministration of DMF with this combined oral contraceptive did not elicit any relevant effects in oral 
contraceptive  exposure.  Reference  is  made  to  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0037  and  results  are  depicted  in 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing 
other progestogens. 
The  MMF  pharmacokinetics  (DMF  240mg  TID  for  3  and  2  days,  respectively)  were  not  altered  in  the 
presence of Avonex and GA. 
Concomitant administration of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) and vaccination was studied with Tecfidera in 
healthy volunteers or MS patients and is therefore likewise relevant for DRF: 
No safety concerns derived from HV/ MS patients treated with Aspirin in addition to DMF treatment based 
on  additional  Studies  109HV321  and  109MS406  (reference  is  made  to  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0036G). 
The effect on concomitant ASA administration on related flushing events in these subjects is described 
in the DMF and DRF product information (SmPC sections 4.4 and/ or 4.5). 
No additional safety concern derived from vaccination of MS patients with non-live vaccines (with either 
a  recall  antigen  (Td),  T-cell  independent  antigen  (PPSV23),  or  a  neoantigen  (MCV4))  in  addition  to 
Tecfidera 
treatment  (reference 
is  made 
to  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0028).  The 
results  and 
recommendations  deriving  from  this  study  is  reflected  in  the  DMF  product  information  (SmPC  section 
4.5), and in the DRF product information. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five  subjects  discontinued  from  any  Phase  1  study  due  to  TEAEs,  which  were  rated  as  related  to 
treatment in three patients (hypersensitivity, blood CK increased, and papular rash). 
In the Phase 3 DRF studies, subjects who discontinued due to TEAEs were at the same time withdrawn 
from the study.  
The incidence of discontinuations due to TEAEs was 8% for subjects in Study A301. TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation  of  DRF  in  >  1  subject  per  treatment  group  were  as  follows:  lymphopenia  (1.3%,  14 
subjects), MS relapse (1%, 11 subjects), lymphocyte count decreased (0.7%, 7 subjects), flushing (5 
subjects), diarrhoea and ALT increased (3 subjects each), and 2 subjects each for glomerular filtration 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 113/148 
 
 
 
rate decreased, LFT increased, and urticaria. 2 subjects discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity 
TEAEs in the de novo group.  
Of 3.8% discontinuations due to AEs in Study A302, 1.6% occurred on DRF and 6% on DMF. Of these, 
0.8%  of  subjects  on  DRF  and  4.8%  of  subjects  on  DMF  discontinued  the  study  due  to  GI  AEs.  The 
majority  of  these  events  were  of  mild  and  moderate  severity,  assessed  as  related  to  treatment  and 
resolved by the end of the study; the 3 severe GI events leading to discontinuation occurred in the DMF 
treatment  group.  Other  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  one  patient  each  were  suicide  attempt, 
dermatitis allergic (both in the DRF group), depression, and urticaria (both in the DMF group). 
AEs leading to dose reduction or dose interruption (only allowed in A301) were reported in 8% of patients 
in Study A301, a majority of them belonging to the de novo group. TEAEs leading to dose reduction or 
dose interruption in ≥ two subjects were lymphopenia/ lymphocyte count decreased (n=17 and n=11), 
diarrhoea  (n=5),  nausea  (n=3),  flushing  (n=6),  and  two  subjects  each  for  abdominal  pain,  chronic 
gastritis,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  erythema,  pruritus,  urticaria,  leukopenia,  pain  in  extremity, 
dyspnoea, vomiting, vision blurred, and dizziness. 
Discontinuations from study treatment and withdrawal from study due to AEs in the DMF Pool A were 
more frequent in the DMF groups compared to placebo (14% DMF and 11% placebo), and headed by MS 
relapse  (6%  placebo  vs.  1%  DMF  240mg  BID,  and  2%  DMF  240mg  TID).  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation  with  higher  incidences  in  DMF-treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo  and  GA  were 
reported  for  GI  disorders,  flushing,  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders  SOCs  (less  than  1%  in  the 
placebo and GA groups and in up to 6% of patients in the DMF groups). The pattern of AEs leading to 
withdrawal from study was similar to that observed for AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Data from Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 indicated a higher discontinuation rate for subjects on DMF 
compared to placebo for the first year (especially the first three months) of treatment, likely associated 
with the occurrence of flushing and GI events. GI events and flushing events were also the main reason 
for dose reductions and interruptions in the DMF studies. 
Long-term treatment with DMF in Study 109MS303 led to discontinuations from treatment due to an AE 
in 16% of subjects, mainly due to MS relapse and lymphopenia, and lymphocyte count decreased. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
No new safety signals have been confirmed based on DRF post-marketing data following its approval in 
the US in 2019.  
However, a number of safety signals came up for DMF after approval of Tecfidera on 30 January 2014.  
The safety signal for PML arose early after approval of Tecfidera following the first confirmed case of PML 
(a fatal event) in a patient with severe prolonged lymphopenia (> 3.5 years) in a clinical study. The risk 
for  PML  has  been  taken  up  in  regulatory  procedures  either  from  a  mechanistical  perspective 
(lymphocytopenia) or based on additional confirmed cases. Reference is made to EMEA/H/C/WS0689/G, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0026, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0030, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/R/0053, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0030, 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/54/G, 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/58, 
and 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63). So far, 12 PML cases have been confirmed for Tecfidera, which all occurred in 
patients with ALC below LLN (<0.91x109/L), and 11 of these cases occurred post marketing. Substantial 
amendments have been introduced in the product information of Tecfidera, including a contraindication 
in patients with suspected or confirmed PML, detailed warnings (stopping rules, additional factors that 
might increase the risk for PML and demand increased vigilance), and description of study findings for 
lymphocyte subsets in Section 4.8. Based on MMF being the same active moiety of DMF and DRF, the 
same risk applies to DRF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 114/148 
 
 
 
At present, lymphopenia seems to increase the risk for PML. Therefore, the mechanism of decreases in 
lymphocyte counts has been evaluated in nonclinical and clinical studies. While nonclinical investigations 
ruled  out  selective  toxicity  of  DMF  and  MMF  on  human  lymphocytes  during  Tecfidera  treatment,  a 
mechanistic rational for the effect of DMF on lymphocytes could not be deduced from clinical studies. 
However, quantitative and qualitative changes within the lymphocyte subpopulations (specifically CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells) in DMF-treated patients have been observed in Study 109MS310, for which results 
are  included  in  Section  4.8  of  the  Tecfidera  SmPC.  Given  the  role  of  CD4+  and  CD8+  T  cells  in  the 
immunological defence against opportunistic infections, it is mechanistically plausible that loss of these 
subsets enhances the susceptibility for PML. In particular, the decline of CD8+ T cells has recently been 
related to the pharmacological activity of DMF. 
The weighted cumulative evidence that derived from a review of post marketing data in line with clinically 
significant cases of reversible liver injury (Drug-induced liver injury), including liver enzyme increases 
(≥ 3x ULN) and elevation of total bilirubin levels (≥ 2x ULN) was deemed sufficient to support a causal 
association  between  hepatotoxicity  and  DMF.  Consequently,  hepatic  injury,  which  was  initially 
categorised  as  an  important  potential  risk,  was  re-categorised  as  an  important  identified  risk  (drug-
induced  liver  injury)  for  DMF  in  the  RMP.  None  of  the  reported  cases  resulted  in  liver  failure,  liver 
transplantation,  or  death.  Cumulatively,  for  DMF  (up  to  26  March  2020),  a  total  of  770  events  of 
progressive hepatic injury in 748 cases were received, of which 267 were HCP-confirmed events and 503 
were consumer-reported events. A warning on hepatic findings and monitoring requirements as well as 
respective ADRs have been included in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Tecfidera/ DRF SmPC. DILI is included 
as an important identified risk in the Tecfidera and DRF RMP. 
Safety  signals  of  overdose,  anaphylaxis  and  thrombocytopenia  were  reported  in  the  postmarketing 
experience and relevant information has been included in the Tecfidera/ DRF product information.  
A  safety  signal  of  Herpes  zoster  derived  from  cumulative  clinical  and  postmarketing  evidence  for 
Tecfidera and adequate warning and description of this ADR and its presentation has been added in the 
product information to also include that in a majority of patients concurrent lymphocyte counts met the 
criteria of moderate to severe lymphopenia.  
Recently, cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported for a DMF-containing product in combination 
with  other  fumaric  acid  esters,  while  no  such  case  derived  from  treatment  with  Tecfidera.  Given  that 
MMF is the active moiety in both drug products, this warning was deemed adequate for Tecfidera and is 
likewise proposed for DRF. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  applicant  developed  a  gastro-resistant  drug  product,  which  contains  a  core  of  DRF  minitablets 
(231 mg per capsule). The amount of DRF in two capsules (i.e. 462 mg DRF) is bioequivalent to 240 mg 
DMF contained in Tecfidera, which is an established treatment for adult patients with RRMS in Europe 
since 2014. Given that DRF and DMF are different prodrugs sharing the same active moiety MMF, relying 
on the safety profile of DMF is considered acceptable for the present application. No pivotal clinical studies 
have been conducted with DRF; therefore, the pivotal Phase 2 and 3 studies for DMF in Tecfidera serve 
as key information for the safety of DRF. 
Product-specific evaluation of clinical safety derives from two clinical phase 3 studies with DRF, i.e., from 
Study A302, an active - controlled study with DMF and a treatment period of 5 weeks (including a 1 week 
titration  period),  and  from  Study  A301,  an  ongoing  OL  study  of  96 weeks  of  DRF  treatment,  which 
enrolled subjects from Study A302 and also de novo subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 115/148 
 
 
 
The integrated safety database for Tecfidera refers to four clinical studies in adult subjects with RRMS 
(partly  placebo-controlled  Phase 2  study  C-1900;  placebo-controlled  Phase 3  studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302; and open-label extension 109MS303). Pooling of Phase 2 and Phase 3 DMF clinical studies 
for assessing safety focusses on the placebo-controlled experience with Tecfidera (Pool A) and on the 
DMF experience from controlled and uncontrolled safety data (Pool B, including preliminary data in study 
109MS303 for up to 5 years; cut-off date 3 August 2011). Moreover, it is cross-referred to an ongoing 
variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G,  in  which  the  final  CSR  from  109MS303  is  under 
evaluation at the time of this assessment. This study comprises a treatment period of at least eight years 
in  addition  to  treatment  with  DMF  in  the  parent  Studies  301  and  302.  Any  outcome  of  this  variation 
relevant to the product information for Tecfidera has been confirmed by the applicant to be reflected in 
the DRF PI. 
Patient exposure 
The majority of subjects treated with either DRF or DMF in Study A302 (i.e. ~95% and 90%), rolled over 
to receive open-label DRF in Study A301. In addition, 593 patients who had not participated in any prior 
DRF  study  received  DRF  as  de  novo  subjects.  Mean  (SD)  exposure  to  DRF  in  any  of  the  two  Phase 3 
studies was 523.9 days (213.61) in 1071 subjects with at least one dose of DRF per the original data 
cut-off 7 February 2020 and a total of 1536.21 subject -years of exposure. Contribution of Study A302 
to  the  overall  subject  exposure  to  DRF  is  negligible  with  a  mean  (SD)  exposure  of  35.2  (4.16)  days. 
Therefore,  Study  A302  adds  to  the  understanding  of  short-term  DRF  and  DMF  safety  and  tolerability 
issues,  i.e.,  GI  disorders,  flushing  and  related  events,  and  elevations  of  liver  enzymes.  In  contrast, 
immunomodulating effects like infections and malignancies need longer treatment durations to develop 
and can at best be retrieved from A301, although, lacking an active comparison. As per the data cut-off 
01 September 2020, completed data are available from 659 of 1057 (62.3%) subjects in A301. 152 of 
1057  subjects  (14.4%)  are  still  ongoing  in  A301.  Updated  safety  data  do  not  pose  additional  safety 
concerns. In both DRF studies combined (original data cut-off 7 February 2020), 972 subjects (88.6%) 
have received DRF for more than six months. 826 subjects (75.3%) and 499 patients (45.5%) received 
DRF  for  more  than  12 months  and  24 months,  respectively.  Moreover,  supportive  (short-term  and 
variable) exposure derives from Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy volunteers and subjects with renal 
impairment (n= 390 in total). 139 (13.2%) of subjects in A301 were > 55 years of age (inclusion criteria 
allowed patients to be included in A301 up to the age of 65 years), with three subjects aged 65 years at 
Baseline. Thus, the “safety profile in patients older than 65 years” is a missing information in the RMP 
(contrasting Tecfidera, for which the age cut-off is 55 years). 
The vast majority of safety data relies on Tecfidera (EPAR reference EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1). 
Controlled  safety  data  (Pool  A)  is  available  for  1720  DMF-treated  subjects  and  836  placebo-treated 
subjects, summing up to 2323.5 subject-years of DMF exposure. Overall, 2468 subjects were exposed 
to DMF in Pool B and of these, 1429 (1056) were exposed for ≥1 year (≥2 years) at doses ≥240 mg 
DMF BID. Moreover, Study 109MS303 with data cut-off as per 8 November 2019 adds to the DMF safety 
data a median (min, max) of 5.848 years (0.00, 9.43) on  DMF relating to 1736 subjects, representing 
8896.19 subject-years of exposure. 
Adverse events (and related laboratory findings) 
(Very)  common  adverse  events  associated  with  DMF  treatment  are  GI  disorders  (including  diarrhoea, 
nausea, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain and vomiting), flushing, skin and subcutaneous disorders 
(pruritus,  rash,  erythema),  haematological  abnormalities  (lymphopenia  and  leukopenia),  increased 
hepatic enzymes, and proteinuria.  
AEs reported with DRF in Studies A301 and A302, their frequency, severity, relation to treatment, and 
the  time  to  onset  were  found  to  be  aligned  with  the  expectations  with  Tecfidera.  No  product-specific 
concerns have been identified. Therefore, it is assumed that safety data from the Tecfidera clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 116/148 
 
 
 
form the basis of the DRF product information and to add or adjust with DRF data if these are considered 
sufficiently robust to supersede specific Tecfidera information. Upon request, adverse events with DRF 
in  the  product  information  have  been  based  on  the  concept  of  treatment-emergence  in  line  with 
Tecfidera. 
In  Study  A301,  88.2%  of  subjects  reported  at  least  1  TEAE.  In  Study  A302,  a  similar  proportion  of 
subjects reported at least 1 TEAE in the DRF group (78.3%) and in the DMF group (83.7%). TEAEs were 
considered  treatment-related  in  a  majority  of  these  subjects.  Most  of  the  TEAEs  in  both  studies  were 
mild or moderate in severity, with < 10% of TEAEs rated as severe.  
In  Study  A301,  the  most  common  TEAEs  were  flushing  (27.2%),  MS  relapse  (19%),  URTI  (14.3%), 
nasopharyngitis (12.9%), lymphopenia (11.2 %), and diarrhoea (10.3%). The pattern and frequency of 
TEAEs  is  compatible  with  a  longer  treatment  duration  in  this  study.  Moreover,  in  Study  A301,  events 
with an onset early after treatment initiation were numerically higher in de novo subjects as compared 
to rollover subjects from either DRF  DMF in A302.  
In Study A302, common TEAEs were comparable for DRF and DMF. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
were  those  known  to  occur  early  during  treatment  (onset  within  the  first  month  of  treatment),  i.e., 
flushing  and  flushing-related  events  (50.4%  overall  [RF:  45.8%,  DMF:  55%])  and  GI  events  (41.9% 
overall; diarrhoea 18.8% overall [DRF: 15.4%, DMF: 22.3%], nausea 17.7% overall [DRF: 14.6%, DMF: 
20.7%]).  
Flushing and flushing-related events  in both DRF studies were in line with incidences in the Tecfidera 
safety  pools  (42%  and  41%  in  Pool  A  and  B,  respectively,  for  DMF  240 mg  BID),  and  also  regarding 
severity and time interval of reporting (during the first three months).  
Gastrointestinal disorder TEAEs are among the most frequently reported side effects of DMF-containing 
drug products, with incidences between 33% (in study 109MS303) and 48% (in Pool A) for DMF 240 mg 
BID  and  in  line  with  data  deriving  from  the  psoriasis  indication  (reference  is  made  to  the  EPAR  of 
Skilarence  EMEA/H/C/002157/0000).  The  incidence  of  GI  events,  mainly  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and 
abdominal  pain,  with  DRF  appears  to  be  similar:  in  A301,  reporting  was  highest  during  the  first 
three months  of  treatment  and  more  frequently  in  de  novo  subjects.  Overall,  31.6%  reported  GI 
disorders  TEAEs,  and  0.9%  of  subjects  reported  serious  GI  disorders.  1.8%  of  subjects  had  a  dose 
reduction/ interruption due to GI events. In Study A302, the overall incidence in both groups combined 
was 41.9%, with a lower reporting in the DRF group as compared to the DMF group (34.8% vs. 49%). 
Gastrointestinal  tolerability  has  been  designated  as  AESI,  for  which  only  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were taken into account. GI AESIs in A302 were reported more frequently in the DMF 
group vs. the DRF group (4.8% vs. 0.8%), all of them leading to discontinuation. The two events in the 
DRF group were diarrhoea and vomiting, while abdominal pain upper was the leading GI event in the 
DMF group.  
The clinical relevance of a slightly lower reporting of the most common GI TEAEs (i.e., diarrhoea, nausea, 
abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, and vomiting) and discontinuations due to GI events as well as 
GI AESI in the DRF versus the DMF group in A302 is, however, debatable given that:  
- the difference is based on a 5-week treatment duration in A302 (including a 1-week titration to the full 
dose), 
- GI events do not appear different for DRF and DMF based on longer treatment durations in Study A301 
(DRF: 31.6%) and in 109MS303 (DMF: ~30% up to the data cut-off 03 August 2011 and 35% up to the 
data cut-off 08 November 2019). Moreover, and as indicated for evaluation of the primary endpoint in 
Study A302, there are several shortcomings, including the lack of validated scales for investigation of GI 
tolerability,  the  choice  of  Number  of  Days  with  any  IGISIS  Symptom  Intensity  Score  ≥  2  as  an 
appropriate endpoint, the robustness of the statistical analyses, and the lack of concordance between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 117/148 
 
 
 
the “efficacy” findings for better GI tolerability and the reported GI TEAEs in a number of treated days 
(10 to 11%). Thus, the informative value of the study claiming favourable GI tolerability has found to 
be low and the clinical relevance of numerical differences in GI tolerability between DRF and DMF could 
not be deduced from the provided data. 
The proposed mechanism behind the claimed increase in GI tolerability of DRF compared with DMF is 
considered  hypothetical,  with  reasons  mentioned  by  the  applicant  being  the  lower  concentration  of 
methanol formed, the larger particle size of DRF limiting binding to receptors within the gastrointestinal 
tract, and the lower electrophilicity of DRF.  
Events captured as GI AESI in A301 (reported in 0.8% of subjects) were qualitatively in line with the 
reference product Tecfidera, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, gastritis and vomiting. However, direct 
comparison to the DMF/ Tecfidera clinical experience is misleading given that the definition of AESI in 
the DRF and DMF programme was different. The Tecfidera SmPC Section 4.8 indicates an onset within 
the first month of treatment while events may continue to occur intermittently throughout treatment, 
which is likewise applicable to DRF.  
In Study A302, patients were instructed to “take study drug with or without food”. The intake with food 
is anticipated to improve tolerability of DMF and likewise of DRF in subjects experiencing flushing or GI 
adverse reactions, which has been added to Section 4.2 of the DRF SmPC. 
Product-specific ADRs for DRF in Table 1 in Section 4.8 of the SmPC have been justified by the applicant 
to be dispensable given that the design of the Phase 3 DRF studies does not allow to derive ADRs (no 
placebo  control  and  OL)  and  no  increased  incidence  in  TEAEs  has  been  observed  in  these  studies. 
Therefore, it is acceptable to rely on the ADRs for Tecfidera.  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  DMF  deriving  from  clinical 
studies  and  post  marketing  experience  were  assessed  for  DRF,  including  anaphylaxis/  angioedema, 
opportunistic infections, all serious infections, lymphopenia, liver injury, malignancies and premalignant 
conditions, renal injury, cardiac disorders, pancreatitis, and GI tolerability. 
Anaphylaxis and angioedema as well as events of pancreatitis were neither reported in Study A302 nor 
in Study A301. 
Almost  half  of  the  subjects  in  A301  had  TEAEs  from  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC  in  line  with 
Tecfidera.  Serious  and  opportunistic  infections  (other  than  PML  and  herpes  zoster)  constitute  an 
important potential risk  in the RMPs of DMF and DRF. No such  events were  reported during A302. In 
A301, 0.6% of subjects had non-systemic, mild to moderate candida infections. Mild to moderate herpes 
zoster/ varicella zoster virus infections occurred in ~2% of subjects.  
Eleven PML cases have been confirmed in patients treated with Tecfidera after marketing authorisation 
in 2014 in addition to a single subject with fatal outcome in clinical Study 109MS303. Lymphopenia is a 
risk factor for serious and/or opportunistic infections, including PML, in patients treated with fumarates 
(reference  is  also  made  to  the  EPAR  of  Skilarence  EMEA/H/C/002157/0000).  Lymphopenia  with 
lymphocyte  counts  below  LLN  (<0.91x109/L)  was  a  commonality  in  all  PML  cases.  Substantial 
amendments on lymphopenia and PML have recently been implemented in the product information for 
Tecfidera  following  variation  EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63,  also  including  a  contraindication  in  patients  with 
suspected or confirmed PML. Given its rarity, it is not unexpected that PML has not been reported with 
DRF so far. 
0.9%  of  subjects  in  A301  had  serious  infections,  amongst  them  one  subject  with  a  fatal  TEAE  of 
pneumonia  (bacterial).  Although,  this  event  was  not  rated  related  to  DRF,  a  contribution  cannot  be 
excluded.  While  a  relation  between  serious  infections  and  minimum  post-baseline  lymphocyte  counts 
could not be established for DMF based on pivotal Phase 3 study data, the lack of a relation between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021

serious  infections  and  severe  prolonged  lymphopenia  cannot  be  assessed  for  DRF  given  that  ALC  < 
0.5x109/L persisting for > 4 weeks led to discontinuation from treatment in DRF studies. 
Lymphopenia (incl. lymphocyte count decreased) is an expected side effect of DMF and DRF treatment, 
with decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts being an identified risk in the RMPs. Decreases in 
lymphocyte (and leukocyte) counts starting at Week 4 through Week 48 with a plateau up to Week 96 
were noted for DRF in line with Tecfidera. Mean decreases were identical to those observed in DMF clinical 
studies, i.e., 30% and 11% for lymphocyte and leukocyte counts, respectively. As per the data cut-off, 
42.4%  of  subjects  in  A301  (443  of  1045  with  available  ALC)  had  lymphocyte  counts  below  LLN  (< 
9
0.91×10
/L)  with  lymphopenia  being  reported  as  moderate  (CTCAE  Grade 2)  in  a  majority  of  these 
subjects (236 of 443). In 13.7% of all subjects (143 of 1045), moderate lymphopenia was prolonged for 
six months and longer and the incidence was slightly higher in DRF  de novo subjects and DRF rollovers 
from A302 as compared to DMF rollovers from A302, probably owing to the fact that treatment duration 
in patients from the DMF group was shorter. 
9
While severe lymphopenia (ALC < 0.5×10
/L) was reported in 8.9% (93 of 1045) of subjects, in none of 
these  subjects  the  lymphopenia  was  prolonged  for  more  than  six months  given  that  subjects  with 
9
lymphocyte counts < 0.5×10
/L for ≥ 4 weeks were to be discontinued from treatment. Information on 
post-discontinuation lymphocyte recovery is clinically important to judge the risk for (serious) infections 
and  to  decide  on  treatment  initiation  with  other  DMTs.  A  6-months  interval  of  post-discontinuation 
monitoring for subjects in A301 with ALC < 0.8x109/L at the end of treatment showed that recovery of 
ALC to ≥LLN was not achieved in all patients. In DMF long-term Study 109MS303, ALC in more than half 
of subjects with ALC < LLN at recovery baseline and < 0.8x109/L at recovery baseline recovered to ≥ 
LLN  within  the  follow-up  period  (up  to  48 weeks).  However,  a  number  of  uncertainties  have  been 
identified 
for  the  datasets  and  statistical  analysis  underlying  this  evaluation 
in  variation 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G  (under  evaluation  at  the  time  of  this  assessment),  which,  at  present, 
precludes  ALC  recovery  data  to  be  included  in  Sections  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPCs  for  Tecfidera  and 
Vumerity. Agreement from the applicant has been received. TEAEs of lymphopenia/ lymphocyte count 
decreased have been reported in 16.7% of patients in Study A301, with slightly more subjects from the 
rollover DMF and DRF groups. Incidences were similar in the first and second year of treatment and in 
less than half of these events, lymphopenia did not resolve by the data cut-off. TEAEs of lymphopenia 
and lymphocyte count decreased combined was the main reason for dose reduction/ interruption in A301 
(2.6% of patients). Owing to the short treatment duration in A302, lymphopenia was reported as TEAE 
in 0.8% of all patients only.  
For DMF and DRF, monitoring of complete blood counts, including lymphocytes needs to be performed 
prior  to  treatment  initiation  and  every  three months.  Discontinuation  of  treatment  in  subjects  with 
prolonged severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts <0.5x109/L) persisting for more than six months is 
recommended  as  well  as  re-assessment  of  the  benefit/risk  in  subjects  with  sustained  moderate 
reductions of absolute lymphocyte counts ≥0.5x 109/L and < 0.8x 109/L for more than six months. In 
patients  with  ALC<LLN,  regular  monitoring  of  lymphocytes  is  advised,  and  additional  factors  might 
further augment the individual PML risk. 
No  new  signal  derives  from  the  DRF  clinical  programme  regarding  the  nature  and  the  incidence  of 
malignancies, which is also not expected given the duration of the studies. Malignancies were reported 
in 0.5% in A301, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 
invasive  ductal  breast  carcinoma,  and  malignant  melanoma.  In  0.7%  of  subjects,  pre-malignant 
conditions were recorded. In the Tecfidera clinical programme, malignancies reported in the DMF groups 
were low and similar to placebo and GA (≤ 1%; transitional cell carcinoma of renal pelvis, basal cell skin 
carcinoma, breast cancer  and cervix cancer in the DMF groups). Long-term treatment with DMF of at 
least  eight years  in  Study  109MS303  was  not  found  to  increase  the  risk  for  malignancies,  but  results

from  PASS Study  109MS401  is  expected  to  further  inform  on  this  potential  risk.  Moreover,  additional 
analyses on malignancies and background rates with focus on skin cancers have been requested in the 
ongoing  variation  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G  to  be  presented  in  the  upcoming  PSUR  (PSUR 
submission date 24 June 2021, under evaluation in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010143/202103 at the time of 
this assessment). These data might entail amendments to the product information of Tecfidera and DRF. 
Malignancies are also a potential risk with DRF in the RMP in line with DMF (in Tecfidera). 
Transient mean increases in liver transaminases with DMF typically develop within the first 4 weeks of 
treatment. In a majority of subjects, elevation in ALT and/ or AST remain below 3x ULN. The incidence 
of  TEAE  associated  with  liver  injury  in  A301  was  7.2%  overall,  with  5.5%  and  2.9%  of  events  being 
increased  liver  transaminases  ALT  and  AST,  most  frequently  reported  within  the  first  2 months  of 
treatment. ALT and AST values > 3x ULN were reported in 2% and 1.1% of subjects, in line with results 
for hepatic events in the DMF clinical pools. Less than 1% of subjects experienced ALT or AST of >5x 
ULN, >10x ULN, or increases in total bilirubin of >1.5x ULN, and the incidence was even lower in A302. 
No subject fulfilled criteria of Hy’s law in the DRF and DMF clinical programme. Cholestatic liver injury, 
hepatic steatosis, and hepatosplenomegaly were each reported in a single subject in A301. Few events 
were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. Drug-induced liver injury is an identified risk for DMF 
and likewise DRF. Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended in the product information. A signal of 
renal toxicity derived from nonclinical studies with DMF. However, DMF was not found to be associated 
with an increased risk of renal or urinary events, neither in pivotal studies nor in the long-term extension 
study (109MS303). Proteinuria, haematuria, and microalbuminuria were each reported in less than 10% 
of patients. These events were mild to moderate in severity and rarely led to treatment discontinuations. 
In  DRF  studies  A301  and  A302,  events  including  their  incidences  were  essentially  in  accordance  with 
those for Tecfidera, e.g., proteinuria was reported as TEAE in 1.3% of patients in A301. There was no 
evidence for impaired renal function with DRF treatment in studies A301 and A302 based on mean serum 
parameters of albumin, creatinine, urate, BUN, or GFR over time, shift analyses, and potentially clinically 
significant  abnormalities.  Urinalysis  results  were  found  in  line  with  Tecfidera,  i.e.  urine  protein,  urine 
ketones  and  urine  occult  blood  in  76.6%,  55.3%,  and  37.4%  of  patients  in  A301;  however,  as  with 
Tecfidera,  results  did  not  correlate  with  renal  injury  TEAEs.  Proteinuria  and  ketonuria  are  labelled  for 
Tecfidera and also for DRF. A PCS of abnormal β2-microglobulin (defined as > 0.300 mg/L) was reported 
in  15.3%  of subjects  in  A301;  however,  no  significant  changes  in  β2-microglobulin  and  microalbumin 
indicative of renal tubular damage were noted across DMF treatment groups up to 12 years of treatment 
in 109MS303.  
No increased risk on cardiac safety could be deduced from DRF treatment and did not emerge during 
human  therapy  with  DMF.  However,  patients  with  significant  cardiovascular  conditions  were  excluded 
from  clinical  trials.  Phase 1  studies  with  DRF  revealed  ventricular  extrasystoles  as  main  finding.  In 
addition, single subjects reported presyncope, palpitations, chest discomfort, dyspnoea, tachycardia and 
sinus tachycardia. In study A301, almost half of the subjects reported with cardiac disorders – related 
TEAEs had rather unspecific dizziness (5.4%). All other TEAEs were reported in ≤ 1.5% of subjects. Two 
cardiac-related  severe  SAEs,  hypertensive  heart  disease  (in  a  patient  with  contributing  medical 
conditions) and cardiac arrest, were fatal. Vital signs and ECG results in Studies A301 and A302 were 
unremarkable. 
Four deaths were reported with DRF, all of which occurred during Study A301 and considered not related 
to  DRF  by  the  Investigator.  Reasons  for  death  were  pneumonia  bacterial  with  subsequent  acute 
respiratory  failure,  fall  (intention  unspecified),  hypertensive  heart  disease  (in  a  subject  with  relevant 
medical  history  and  pre-existing  condition,  e.g.,  hypercholesterolaemia),  and  sudden  cardiac  arrest. 
While a contribution of DRF to these deaths cannot be ruled out, none of these death cases poses an 
additional concern over DMF/ Tecfidera – reported deaths in the respective clinical programme. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 120/148 
 
 
 
No  additional  concern  derives  from  the  reporting  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  DRF  studies:  The 
overall incidence of SAEs in A301 was 11.4% (n= 120 subjects), with MS relapse accounting for half of 
the SAEs, which is consistent with reporting of SAEs in the Tecfidera safety pools with MS relapse being 
the most frequently reported SAE. Infections and GI disorders were serious in few subjects only (0.7% 
and 0.9%). SAEs were rated as treatment-related in 0.9% (n=10) subjects, with almost half of them 
from the GI disorders SOC. In Study A302, a similar number of subjects in both groups reported SAEs 
(1.4%  in  total  [7 subjects]),  which  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  treatment  and  were 
recovered/resolved  or  resolved  with  sequelae  by  the  end  of  the  study.  MS  relapse  was  the  only  SAE 
reported in more than 1 patient in each group.  
Discontinuations due to TEAEs were low in study A302 (3.8% of all patients; 1.6% in the DRF group and 
6% in the DMF group) with GI tolerability AEs being the reason in half of the discontinued subjects on 
DRF and in all but two subjects on DMF. Discontinuations in A301 (8% of patients) were mainly due to 
events known to occur with longer treatment duration, i.e., MS relapse and lymphopenia/ lymphocyte 
count decreased. Discontinuations due to lymphopenia were not reported in the DMF pivotal trials given 
that low lymphocyte counts were not a stopping criterion. Lymphopenia as a reason for discontinuation 
of DMF was first reported in 109MS303 (in 1% of DMF subjects). As expected, discontinuations due to 
GI events were lower in A301 as in A302 and more frequent in the de novo group. 
No significant findings were retrieved for haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory parameters 
not  mentioned  in  previous  sections,  except  for  a  transient  increase  in  eosinophils  during  the  first 
2 months of treatment, which is labelled for DMF and was likewise observed in A302 and in the de novo 
DRF group in Study A301. 
There  were  no  relevant  changes  or  findings  in  vital  sign  parameters,  QTc  interval  or  any  other 
quantitative or qualitative ECG parameter changes. Any potentially clinically significant values observed 
for DRF were in line with the DMF clinical study experience. 
Data from the DRF clinical programme do not indicate an increased risk for suicidality with DRF treatment 
and no such risk has been identified with DMF. Based on the C-SSRS, which was not routinely conducted 
in the DMF clinical programme, an increase of suicidal ideation post-baseline over baseline was reported 
in  all  subjects  (2.1%  vs.  0.2%).  However,  this  is  not  unexpected  in  a  population  with  an  increased 
prevalence of depression over a longer period.  
DRF (like DMF) was not found to bear a risk for abuse potential. 
Safety in special populations 
Similar to DMF, the safety profile of DRF in MS patients seems comparable across gender, age and other 
intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  based  on  the  data  presented  and  with  some  variability  in  reporting  of 
adverse events. However, this is not considered of clinical relevance. The safety profile of DRF in subjects 
≥  55  years  of  age  seems  comparable  to  the  safety  profile  in  subjects  <  55 years  of  age  based  upon 
additional  analysis  of  TEAEs  provided  by  the  applicant.  This  is  relevant  given  that  DMF  clinical  safety 
data are only available (and thus supportive for DRF) in subjects up to 55 years of age. The quality of 
available (uncontrolled) DRF data in the elderly up to an age of 65 years in now adequately reflected in 
Section 4.2 of the DRF SmPC. 
No correlation between renal impairment severity and MMF exposure was observed in a Phase 1 study 
in subjects with no, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. However, no differences in the safety 
profile  (based  on  reporting  of  TEAEs  and  SAEs)  could  be  observed  in  this  study.  In  support  of  these 
findings, no qualitative and quantitative difference in the safety profile was noted in patients with normal 
renal function and patients with mild renal impairment in A301. This is in line with the results from a 
post-hoc analysis in the DMF extension study 109MS303. No dose adjustment of DRF (like with DMF) is 
required based on these findings. DRF (and likewise DMF) has not been administered to patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 121/148 
 
 
 
(persisting) moderate and/ or severe renal impairment and this is considered a missing information in 
the RMP and labelled in Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. In addition, the applicant provided adequate 
(non-)  clinical  data  demonstrating  that  HES  metabolite  is  biologically  inactive  and  pharmacologically 
inert. Although HES accumulation was shown with increasing renal impairment, the safety profile was 
comparable between subjects with renal impairment and those with normal renal function.  
No studies with DRF were conducted in patients with liver impairment. DRF is metabolised by esterases 
and  MMF  is  metabolised  through  the  TCA  cycle,  without  CYP  isoenzyme  involvement;  thus,  hepatic 
impairment is not assumed to alter PK of DRF or MMF and this is labelled in Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC.  
No  safety  signal  of  foetal  abnormalities  derives  from  ten pregnancies  reported  in  the  DRF  clinical 
programme.  No such abnormalities have been identified in the  controlled clinical DMF programme. In 
line with Tecfidera, DRF is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not  using  appropriate  contraception  given  that  animal  studies  have  shown  reproductive  toxicity.  The 
impact of DRF on pregnancy outcomes will be evaluated in a prospective pregnancy registry cohort study 
(Study  272MS401).  In  addition,  a  retrospective  analysis  of  respective  pregnancy  data  from  European 
product-independent  MS  and  pregnancy  registries  might  be  considered  at  a  later  time  point  (post-
authorisation), once exposure data becomes available for Vumerity, facilitating a decision about suitable 
national registries across the EU. No additional information on pregnancy outcome with DMF on 3 cases 
of congenital abnormalities could be retrieved from study 109MS303 (in EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G 
(under evaluation at the time of this assessment). 
The  safety  of  DRF  has  not  been  studied  in  paediatric  patients.  The  PIP  for  DRF  includes  two  clinical 
studies in patients 10 to less than 18 years of age with RRMS. Paediatric data available for DMF (based 
on  two  small  studies  not  included  in  the  PIP  for  Tecfidera)  do  not  indicate  an  altered  safety  profile. 
However,  given  that  available  paediatric  safety  data  for  DMF  are  based  on  a  small  and  uncontrolled 
dataset, this information is of limited value for DRF and has been agreed by the applicant to be deleted 
in the product information. 
With  regard  to  drug-drug  interactions,  in  vitro  studies  demonstrated  that  neither  DRF  nor  MMF  (or 
metabolites) inhibit or induce CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. While DRF showed the 
potential to inhibit P-gp transport in vitro (but not to induce it), this could not be confirmed in a single 
in vivo DDI study with digoxin. Therefore, formal interaction studies were not conducted and DRF, like 
DMF, is not suspected to alter the PK of concomitantly administered drugs. Additional data are available 
on  administration  of  DMF  with  acetylsalicylic  acid,  oral  contraceptives,  and  vaccination  with  non-live 
vaccines (Section 4.4 and/ or Section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Post-marketing experience 
Post  marketing  data,  following  approval  of  DRF  in  the  US  in  2019,  did  not  alter  the  perception  of  its 
safety profile. Some safety signals/ potential safety concerns derived from post marketing experience 
with  Tecfidera  have  not  been  identified  in  the  DRF  phase 3  clinical  programme.  These  include  PML, 
lymphopenia/  leukopenia,  Herpes  Zoster,  drug-induced  liver  injury,  cases  of  overdose,  anaphylactic 
reactions,  thrombocytopenia,  and  Fanconi  syndrome.  Given  that  these  safety  concerns  have  been 
assessed  and  confirmed  for  Tecfidera,  warnings  and  ADRs  have  also  been  included  in  the  proposed 
product information and in the RMP for DRF.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Given that comprehensive safety data and post-marketing experience is available for Tecfidera, which is 
approved in the same indication and which results in bioequivalent exposure of MMF, it seems acceptable 
that the safety database of DRF is not based on pivotal trial data.  
An improved GI tolerability of DRF over DMF has not been established based on the data provided for 
Study A302.  
No  unexpected  safety  findings  have  been  reported  with  DRF  when  compared  to  the  pivotal  safety 
experience  with  DMF  of  similar  treatment  duration.  While  duration  of  follow-up  for  the  Phase 3  DRF 
studies with a median exposure of almost 2 years limits the ability to assess some potential long-term 
safety outcomes, e.g., malignancies and (serious) opportunistic infections, no new concerns have been 
raised  based  on  the  safety  results  in  the  long-term  extension  Study  109MS303  (with  up  to  12 years 
exposure). However, post-marketing data for Tecfidera indicated safety signals for rare events like PML, 
anaphylaxis, and Fanconi syndrome that need likewise to be considered for DRF. 
For AESI, for example lymphopenia, changes in renal laboratory tests (renal injury), and (drug-induced) 
liver injury, warnings and detailed description of these safety issues are recommended in the DRF product 
information in line with Tecfidera (see SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8). These include regular monitoring and 
appropriate treatment discontinuation rules at defined cut-off values of laboratory assessments. 
Approval  of  DRF  can  now  be  recommended  from  a  safety  perspective.  The  Pharmacovigilance  Plan 
delineated in the RMP has been amended in line with the provided data.

2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Since  the  major  active  metabolite  MMF  was  established  to  be  the  same  for diroximel  fumarate  as  for 
dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate should be added to the entry for dimethyl fumarate (MS) in the 
EURD list.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MS is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS characterised by inflammation, 
demyelination, neuronal and oligodendrocyte loss, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, leading to 
irreversible deficits in physical function and cognition and an impaired quality of life. Typically, MS starts 
in the second or third decade of life.  
RRMS is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 85% of patients at diagnosis, and it 
is characterised by alternating exacerbations of neurological dysfunction followed by periods of remission 
with partial or total recovery and clinical stability, which can last for months or years (EMA MS guideline, 
EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). 
The sought indication for this application is:  
Vumerity  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis  (see  section  5.1  for  important  information  on  the  populations  for  which  efficacy  has 
been established). 
The starting dose for diroximel fumarate is 231 mg twice a day orally. After 7 days, the dose should be 
increased  to the  recommended  maintenance  dose  of  462  mg  (administered  as  two  231 mg  capsules) 
twice a day orally. Temporary dose reductions to 231 mg twice a day may be considered for individuals 
who do not tolerate the maintenance dose. Within 1 month, the recommended dose of 462 mg twice a 
day should be resumed. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In  addition  to  medicines  approved  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  MS  (e.g.,  aminopyridine  for 
improvement of walking ability) and for the treatment of relapses (such as corticosteroids), there are 
currently more than 10 DMTs approved for use in patients with RRMS and/ or other forms of RMS in the 
EU. In a clinical setting, early treatment of relapsing MS usually starts with a substance from the IFN-
beta  class,  GA,  dimethyl  fumarate  or  teriflunomide.  These  medicines  are  characterised  by  a  rather 
moderate clinical efficacy (relative relapse reduction compared to placebo in the 30–50% range) and are 
therefore used in subjects without high disease activity.  
A higher relative relapse reduction was found to be achieved by the S1P receptor modulator fingolimod, 
which is therefore approved for highly active RRMS only owing to its safety profile. Safety concerns with 
fingolimod  include  cardiac  effects  at  treatment  initiation,  serious  and  opportunistic  infections,  PML, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 129/148 
 
 
 
cutaneous malignancies, lymphoma, macular oedema, posterior reversible encephalopathy, respiratory 
effects, increased liver enzymes and the risk of rebound after stopping the treatment. 
Three drugs from the class of S1P receptor modulators have recently been approved, i.e., siponimod, 
ozanimod and ponesimod. Siponimod is indicated for the treatment of adults with secondary progressive 
MS with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity. Ozanimod is 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  RRMS  with  active  disease  as  defined  by  clinical  or 
imaging  features.  Ponesimod  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of 
multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. 
The monoclonal DMTs anti CD-20, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab are indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Other DMTs include the 
monoclonal  antibodies  alemtuzumab  and  natalizumab,  as  well  as  cladribine,  a  nucleoside  analogue  of 
deoxyadenosine , which are restricted to subjects with highly active disease due to less favourable safety 
profiles. Daclizumab has been withdrawn from the market in 2018 due to serious safety concerns (cases 
of  serious  inflammatory  brain  disorders).  The  chemotherapeutic  agent  mitoxantrone  is  reserved  for 
patients with high active MS without alternative treatment options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This MAA includes data for both DRF and DMF. The primary evaluation of DRF efficacy is based on a PK 
bridging approach between DRF and DMF with respect to the common active metabolite MMF, and no 
placebo-controlled  clinical  efficacy  study  with  typical  MS  disease  endpoints  was  conducted  in  the  DRF 
clinical programme. The clinical efficacy and safety package for DRF thus relies primarily on DMF data 
already 
submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of 
the  Tecfidera  MAA 
(Tecfidera  EPAR 
EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1).

The  clinical  programme  for  DRF  includes  ten  completed  Phase 1  studies  and  one  completed  and 
one ongoing Phase 3 studies. Of the 12 clinical studies with DRF, 11 have been completed, and one is 
ongoing as of the clinical cut-off date of 07 February 2020. These studies include the following:  
•  seven Phase 1 studies to assess the PK, ADME, DDIs, effects on cardiac repolarisation, and 
PK in subjects with renal impairment 
• 
three Phase 1 studies to establish relative BA of MMF between DRF and DMF under fasted 
and fed conditions as well as with varying conditions of fat and caloric content 
•  one Phase 3, double-blind study to evaluate the comparative GI tolerability of DRF and DMF 
(Study A302 [EVOLVE-MS2]) 
•  one Phase 3, open-label safety study of DRF (Study A301 [EVOLVE-MS1], ongoing) 
Study A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2) was conducted in two parts (Parts A and B). Parts A and B were identical in 
study design and included a 5-week, DB treatment period with 2 blind treatment arms (DRF and DMF). 
The first 120 eligible subjects were randomised to one of the two treatment groups in Part A (n = 60 per 
group). Once randomisation for Part A was complete, the next 386 eligible subjects were randomised 
into one of the two treatment groups in Part B (194 subjects in the DRF group and 192 subjects in the 
DMF group).

GI tolerability was determined using the IGISIS and GGISIS. A number of secondary, exploratory and 
other endpoints have been also used for assessment. Typical MS disease assessments (such as EDSS, 
MS relapse, T25-FW, SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L) belonged to other endpoints. 
The  Study  A302  had  an  adaptive  design  such  that  data  from  Part  A  could  be  used  to  modify  the  GI 
tolerability endpoints and sample size in the study. Part A was exploratory. Following completion of Part 
A, the applicant conducted a planned, unblinded exploratory analysis of the Part A GI tolerability and 
safety data to inform the endpoint selection for the overall study. The SAP was updated following the 
review of Part A data. This adaptive approach was taken to better inform the sample size of Part B and 
the overall study analysis given that the endpoints were based on exploratory GI symptom scales that 
were being used for the first time. 
Study A301 (EVOLV-MS-1), still ongoing, attempts to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
DRF in adults with RRMS. In this multicentre OL study, DRF was administered up to 96 weeks for the 
treatment of RRMS. The target population for this study was adults, aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosed with 
RRMS.  
DMF Clinical Data 
Four DMF studies are particularly relevant in supporting the dosing, efficacy, and safety for DRF: a Phase 
2 placebo-controlled dose-finding study for DMF (Study C-1900), a 2-year, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study (Study 109MS301), a 2-year, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study with an active comparator (Study 
109MS302), and an open-label extension study (Study109MS303). These studies and an interim report 
for 109MS303 have been assessed during the MA procedure for Tecfidera (DMF). 
Study 109MS301 (DEFINE) 
Study 109MS301 was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of DMF in participants with RRMS. 
The  study  was  a  Randomized,  Multicentre,  DB,  Placebo-Controlled,  Dose-Comparison  Study.  Subjects 
were  randomised  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  DMF  240  mg  BID,  DMF  240  mg  TID,  or  placebo.  1011 
subjects were planned, 1237 subjects were randomised, and 1234 subjects were dosed. 
Study 109MS302 (CONFIRM) 
Study  109MS302  was  a  pivotal  Phase  3  Randomized,  Multicentre,  Placebo-Controlled,  double-blind, 
rater-blind and Active Reference (GA) Comparison Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of BG00012 
in  Subjects  With  Relapsing-Remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis  (RRMS).  Participants  were  randomised  in  a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to receive DMF 240 mg BID, DMF 240 mg TID, GA, or placebo. A total of 1232 subjects 
were planned, 1430 subjects were randomised, and 1417 subjects were dosed.   
Study C-1900 
A phase 2, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, DB, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, which 
provided dose-response data and supported the continued development of the DMF 240 mg TID dose. 
The sample size for this study was 257 randomised subjects.  
Study 1409MS303 (ENDORSE) 
Study 109MS303 was the OLE study of the pivotal Phase 3 studies (Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302) 
and was ongoing at the time of the submission of the Tecfidera MAA. Interim efficacy results through 03 
August 2011 were provided with the Tecfidera MAA. The final results have been submitted with this MAA.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The development strategy for DRF was based upon the bioequivalent exposure levels of MMF after oral 
dosing  of  DRF  462  mg  and  DMF  240  mg  and  a  PK  bridging  approach  between  DRF  and  DMF.  
Bioequivalence to DMF has been shown for the active moiety MMF. A similar food effect for both DRF and 
DMF could also be shown, therefore DRF can be given with instructions for intake similar to Tecfidera®. 
DRF clinical efficacy data 
In the short-term Study A302 for the pooled data in Parts A and B, the mean values of event days for 
observed diaries (i.e., all diaries collected, without imputation of any values) were 1.5 days and 2.5 days 
for the primary endpoint (Number of Days With Any IGISIS Symptoms Intensity Score ≥2), for the DRF 
and DMF groups, respectively. This was adjusted for study parts, region (US and non-US), age, and BMI 
and led to a rate of 0.041 for the DRF group, which was lower than the rate 0.076 for the DMF group. 
The rate ratio for the pooled Parts A and B was 0.542 (95% CI [0.390, 0.754]) with a corresponding 
p=0.0003, representing a relative reduction in GI symptoms of 45.8% in the DRF group compared with 
the DMF group. 
After a requested imputation analysis, for the FAS population of Part B only, the mean (95% CI) number 
of event days for imputed diaries were 1.76 days (1.271, 2.248) and 2.51 days (1.910, 3.114) for the 
DRF (ALKS 8700) and DMF groups, respectively with a difference of 0.75 of a day. The rate (95% CI) 
obtained  from  the  negative  binomial  model  was  0.043  (-0.172,  0.258)  for  the  DRF  group,  which  was 
lower  than  the  0.070  (-0.134,  0.275)  in  the  DMF  group.  The  rate  ratio  (95%  CI)  was  0.609  (0.300, 
0.918), with a corresponding p = 0.0132. 
Statistically significant differences have been also demonstrated in the FAS population for the part B only 
(0.520,  p=0.0007).  It  is  noted  that  Part  B  results  (key  secondary  endpoint)  were  significant  and 
consistent  with  the  pooled  results.  Results  of  GGISIS  that  were  not  statistically  significant  but  all 
numerically favoured DRF. These differences in IGISIS and GGISIS and other secondary endpoints (e.g., 
Number of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 1 and ≥ 3 relative to exposure 
days in Part A and Part B and Worst IGISIS individual symptom intensity score by week during the 5-
week treatment period in Part A and Part B) after short term treatment, could be indicative of better GI 
tolerability in favour of DRF compared to DMF. In the case of the exploratory and other endpoints, which 
were typical MS relevant endpoints, it was anticipated that no meaningful differences could be observed 
between the two treatments, DMF and DRF, due to the short duration of the study. However, it is noted 
that the two treatments (despite the short duration of 12 weeks) behaved similarly i.e. EDSS (mean and 
median), MS relapse, T25-FW, SF-12, EQ-5D-5L scores at baseline and their change from baseline were 
similar between ALKS 8700 (DRF) and DMF. 
In the open label study A301, the efficacy results for clinical and MRI endpoints in participants with RRMS 
treated with DRF in Study A301 showed treatment effects in line with expectations from data available 
for DMF.  
The mean change from baseline in the GdE lesions count for the De Novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover 
group, and the DMF Rollover group was -0.85, -0.49, and -0.97 lesions, respectively, which corresponds 
to 64.4%, 80.3%, and 80.2% decrease from baseline, respectively. Overall, there was an increase in 
the proportion of participants with 0 GdE lesions (20.7%) from baseline to Week 96 as well as decreases 
in the proportions of participants with 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and ≥ 9 GdE lesions (-14.7%, -3.8%, and -1.9%, 
respectively) from baseline to Week 96. Across the 3 groups, a high proportion of participants (> 90%) 
had 0 GdE lesions at Week 96.

The majority of subjects (84.5% [893/1057]) did not experience a protocol-defined relapse during the 
course of the study. The ARR for the overall Safety population was 0.14, with similar ARR values across 
the treatment groups.  
The mean EDSS score calculated at baseline was similar across the groups. In the FAS population, the 
mean EDSS score in the De Novo group, the ALKS-8700 Rollover group, and the DMF Rollover group 
was 2.71, 2.64, and 2.71, respectively. 
The proportion of subjects with confirmed disability progression sustained for 12 weeks was low in all 
groups, with 8.1% of subjects in the de novo group and 7.2% and 8.9% participants in the ALKS-8700 
and DMF Rollover groups, respectively, experiencing confirmed disability progression. 
DMF clinical efficacy data 
In each study, both doses led to an approximately 50% reduction of the ARR relative to placebo (Study 
109MS301: 53% reduction with BID and 48% reduction with TID; Study 109MS302: 44% reduction with 
BID and 51% reduction with TID). For the integrated analysis, DMF 240 mg BID reduced the ARR by 
48.5% compared with placebo over two years of treatment.  
In Study 109MS301, the estimated proportion of subjects with 24-week confirmed disability progression 
at 2 years was 0.169 for placebo, 0.128 for BID, and 0.119 for TID (23% reduction for BID and 31% 
reduction for TID relative to placebo; p = 0.1893 and 0.0760, respectively). In Study 109MS302, the 
estimated proportion of participants with 24-week confirmed disability progression at 2 years was 0.125 
for placebo, 0.078 for BID, and 0.086 for TID (38% reduction for BID and 33% reduction for TID relative 
to placebo; p = 0.0630 and 0.1172, respectively). 
Approximately 45% of subjects in Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 underwent MRI brain scans. DMF 
led to significant and statistically robust improvements in all MRI measures of brain lesion activity for 
both doses in Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. 
The adjusted ARR in subjects treated with Tecfidera was low and remained stable throughout the entire 
treatment  period  in  Studies  109MS301  or  109MS302  and  Study  109MS303  for  participants  receiving 
DMF BID continuously. 
Results from the pivotal Phase 3 Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 demonstrated that the dose 240 mg 
BID  of DMF consistently  provided  significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  in  both  clinical  and 
MRI  outcome  measures  and  showed  increased  efficacy  compared  with  an  approved  first-line  therapy, 
GA, in participants with RRMS.  
Based on the results of the bioequivalence studies and upon the similar exposure levels of MMF, DRF 
(after  oral  dosing  of  462  mg)  can  rely  on  the  DMF  clinical  study  programme  with  an  established 
favourable benefit/risk ratio for DMF-MMF which led to the approval for Tecfidera.  
The  final  results  of  the  extension  study  109MS303,  submitted  with  the  MAA  for  DRF,  confirmed  the 
maintained  treatment  effect  of  DMF  240 mg BID  with  low  relapse  rates  and  confirmed  disability 
progression for up to 12 years of treatment (duration combined with Phase 3 studies). 
In the extension study (Study 109MS303), there was no evidence of diminished efficacy in reduction of 
ARR after an additional year (a total of 3 years) of dosing. During Study 109MS303, more than half of 
all  participants  treated  with  Tecfidera  240 mg  BID  did  not  have  a  relapse  (BID/BID,  60%  and 
placebo/BID, 66%). In Study 109MS303, 752 participants were included in an MRI cohort. Final results 
from extension Study 109MS303 MRI assessments showed that the majority of subjects within the MRI 
cohort had no GdE lesions and the number of GdE lesions remained low.

Although, OLE data should generally be interpreted with caution with regard to efficacy due to potential 
methodological issues, the updated and final long-term efficacy results of Study 109MS303 support the 
conclusion that the effect of Tecfidera and likewise of Vumerity is maintained in adult patients with RRMS. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Design of study A302 
There were differences in IGISIS and GGISIS and other secondary endpoints (e.g., Number of days with 
any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 1 and ≥ 3 relative to exposure days in Part A and Part 
B and Worst IGISIS individual symptom intensity score by week during the 5-week treatment period in 
Part A and Part B), which could have been indicative of better GI tolerability in favour of DRF compared 
to DMF. However, the results of the study A302 cannot be considered adequate to allow inclusion of a 
claim in the SmPC of DRF, due to a number of deficiencies such as: validity of scales, choice of Number 
of  Days  with  any  IGISIS  Symptom  Intensity  Score  ≥  2  relative  to  exposure  days  as    an  endpoint, 
robustness of statistical analyses and the lack of clinically relevant and meaningful findings (please see 
above in the relevant sections). 
Primary endpoint of A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2) 
There are several issues with the choice of scales for investigation of GI tolerability, namely the IGISIS 
and GGISIS scales. According to the applicant, the IGISIS is designed to assess the incidence, intensity, 
onset, duration, and functional impact of 5 individual GI symptoms: nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal 
pain, lower abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. The IGISIS was administered twice daily within nine hours 
of  taking  the  study  drug.  The  severity  of  each  individual  symptom  is  rated  via  an  11-point  numeric 
severity rating scale, where 0 indicates no symptom and 10 indicates maximum symptom severity. If an 
IGISIS symptom was recorded as ongoing, only the initial intensity score was collected (i.e., logically 
skipped  item)  and  the  initial  intensity  score  collected  at  the  symptom  start  was  carried  over  until 
symptom end. However, these scales were PROs and patients responded to the questionnaires using e-
diaries.  Bias  could  be  an  inherent  characteristic  of  such  a  PRO  compared  to  a  more  reliable  clinician 
reported outcomes. These scales were used to perform a comparison between DMF and DRF to support 
a better GI tolerability for DRF.  
There were uncertainties on how symptoms were recorded and counted. It has been clarified that one 
event day was counted when a patient recorded more than 1 symptom in a day with a symptom score 
≥ 2 and similarly, one event day was counted in case a symptom ended in the afternoon and another 
symptom started.   
Furthermore,  since  one  day  has  been  considered  in  the  main  analysis  regardless  of  the  number  of 
symptoms reported above the cut-off of ≥ 2 in the same day, an analysis comparing the number of event 
days with 2 or 3 different symptoms score ≥ 2 in both treatment groups has been provided upon request.  
Since  the  analysis  from  both  part  A  and  part  B  cannot  be  considered  acceptable,  for  only  part  B  FAS 
population the difference in the Summary of number of days with at least 2 IGISIS symptoms intensity 
scores ≥ 2 was 0.5 between DRF and DMF in a total of approximately 35 exposure days (corresponding 
to  approximately  1.4%  of  exposure  days).  The  difference  in  the  Summary  of  number  of  days  with  at 
least 3 IGISIS symptoms intensity scores ≥ 2 was 0.2 between DRF and DMF (~0.6% of exposure days). 
For the event days with at least 1 IGISIS symptoms intensity scores ≥ 2 the difference between DRF 
and DMF was 0.84 of a day (~2.4% of exposure days) or with appropriate imputation analysis 0.75 of a 
day (corresponding to ~2.1% of approximately 35 exposure days). Such small differences between the 
two groups, using scales of questionable validity and specificity, with results from both parts A and B 
and from a single Study A302, cannot be considered as an appropriate justification able to support an 
advantage in GI tolerability for DRF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 134/148 
 
 
 
Using a symptom intensity score ≥ 2 the event days were quite low with 1.5 and 2.5 days for DRF and 
DMF, respectively. It is noted that the Number of Days with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 3 is 
below  1  for  ALKS  8700  (DRF)  (0.9)  for  Part  A  and  B  combined  and  for  Part  B  only  (0.7).  Even  lower 
numbers were found for Number of Days with any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 4, 5 and 6, whilst 
these scores would have been expected to have more clinical significance. The numbers with any IGISIS 
Symptom Intensity Scores ≥ 3, 4, 5 and 6 are very low to draw any clinically meaningful conclusions and 
are questioning the clinical usefulness of these scales.  
In the case of number of days any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 1, the results for ALKS 8700 (DRF) 
and  DMF  were  2.9  and  3.9,  respectively.  But  the  rate  ratio,  albeit  statistically  significant,  was  0.714 
indicating only small differences in favour of ALKS 8700 (DRF) and a potential reduction of 28.6% in the 
number of days any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 1, lower than the claimed reduction of 46% in 
the number of days any IGISIS Symptom Intensity Score ≥ 2. 
The clinical relevance of the choice of the endpoint is still not established. One could argue that a result—
driven approach was applied for the intensity score ≥2. The applicant provided a discussion as to why 
the  Number  of  Days  with  any  IGISIS  Symptom  Intensity  Score  ≥2  relative  to  exposure  days  is  an 
appropriate  endpoint  to  provide  a  clinically  relevant  and  meaningful  outcome.  However,  despite  the 
argumentation, it could not be robustly demonstrated that such an endpoint was an appropriate one to 
provide a clinically relevant and meaningful outcome. The number of event days are very small. Even 
with an IGISIS symptom intensity score ≥ 2 the difference between the DRF and the DMF group was 
less  than  1  day.  Differences  in  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  GI  TEAEs  and  in  the  percentages  of 
mean duration in days between the two groups were also very small. Additional calculations were needed 
in almost all analyses presented in order to show a reduction in GI AEs and an advantage in favour of 
DRF.   
Furthermore, validation for the two scales used to show better GI tolerability of DRF compared to DMF 
is not available. As admitted by the applicant these two patient-assessed GI tolerability scales have not 
been previously used in a clinical trial setting and were tailored for DRF. The publications referred to, are 
using different versions of these scales.  
It is acknowledged that the evaluation of GI events is not a typical assessment for management of MS 
and as a result, no validated scales are up to now available to measure this outcome. It is noted that 
IGISIS  and  GGISIS  were  adapted  and  have  several  similarities  to  the  validated  Flushing  Symptom 
Questionnaire (FSQ). During validation of the FSQ, the percentage of days with a score above a threshold 
of 1 and 4 were found to significantly discriminate among groups using FSQ. However, it is still unclear 
what  difference  between  the  assessed  therapies  constitutes  a  minimal  significant  or  a  clinically 
meaningful difference for IGISIS and GGISIS. It should be noted that with respect to the approach used 
(by Norquist et al 2007 and Paolini et al 2008) for detecting differences in cutaneous flushing (redness, 
warmth, tingling and/or itching) between niacin and placebo, this did not result in any regulatory action. 
Bias,  increased  patients’  expectations  and  tailored  modified  scales  (similar  to  a  “cherry  picking” 
approach) may have been introduced in the measurements. It is questionable whether the findings from 
these  scales  would  be  reproducible  and  consistent  with  another  treatment  for  MS  and  able  to  detect 
differences between different treatments, either. 
Finally, it is considered that the “efficacy” findings for better GI tolerability are not in accordance with 
the  safety  GI  ADRs.  The  applicant  discussed  the  similarities  in  GI  tolerability  ADRs  from  a  safety 
perspective  and  the  findings  from  the  IGISIS  and  GGISIS  scales.  Even  with  selected  additional 
calculations, the numbers are so small that they cannot be considered to have any clinical relevance or 
to be sufficient enough to detect and substantiate differences between the two treatments. 
Analyses of the results of A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 135/148 
 
 
 
In the IGISIS scale, if a symptom was assessed as ongoing, it was only recorded in the initial intensity 
score. Therefore, the applicant is asked to comment on which of the analysed parameters of the IGISIS 
scale allowed for the assessment of the severity of the side effects, which increased in intensity over 
time (A302).  
In the example of the applicant, whereby a participant records an ongoing symptom of nausea in the 
morning diary with an intensity score of 3 and over the course of the day a new nausea symptom with 
a newly categorised intensity score (for example, 6) is used, may not be a true reflection of the clinical 
condition of the patient or the course of the symptoms. It does not truly represent the worsening or the 
deterioration of the symptom and may provide a false picture of the symptom, introducing a bias. The 
same applies to recording a lower intensity score for a symptom that improves. The assumption that the 
symptom is unchanged until the symptom ended or symptom severity changed appears unverifiable, it 
would  correspond  to  a  last  observation  carried  forward  approach  and  creates  a  potentially  biased 
outcome. 
Due to the adaptive design, endpoints and sample size of Part B in Study A302 was finalised after the 
unblinded  data  from  exploratory  Part  A  have  been  examined.  Due  to  this  unblinded  interim  analysis, 
after which the final version of the SAP was generated, pooling of both parts cannot be accepted as a 
valid procedure. The primary analysis based on pooled Part A and Part B data is not acceptable due to 
the unblinded interim analysis with a potential type-1 error inflation and the finalisation of the SAP after 
the interim analysis. The analysis of the pooled data could therefore be biased. Only Part B data should 
be taken into account for the efficacy conclusions with respect to all analyses.  
However, due to the lack of pre-specified multiplicity procedure, the initiation of Part B after unblinding 
the data and the finalisation of the SAP after the interim analysis, the pooled analysis is still considered 
exploratory  and  cannot  be  confirmatory.  Nevertheless,  the  pooled  analysis  may  be  regarded  as 
supportive in a descriptive way. In any case, pooled analysis and Part B analysis result in comparable 
results. It should be pointed out however, that the GI tolerability primary endpoint for Study A302 was 
the Number of days with any IGISIS individual symptom intensity score ≥ 2 relative to exposure days 
in Part A and Part B combined. 
The main analysis (if based on Part B data), i.e., the use of a negative binomial model for the number 
of  days  with  any  symptom  intensity  score  ≥  2  using  the  log  number  of  exposure  days  as  an  offset 
parameter  is  acceptable  in  general.  However,  the  analysis  was  not  clearly  specified  with  respect  to 
potential additional covariates. In addition, it is not clear whether the envisaged conditional procedure 
where the use of the model depends on the outcome still maintains the type-1 error, although inflation 
may not be considerable. This may, however, not be considered as a relevant issue since the negative 
binomial model was finally used with the initially planned covariates. Still, in order to show robustness, 
the  applicant  provided  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  the  proposed  Poisson  model  with  adjustment  for 
overdispersion and the zero-inflated negative binomial model.  
Furthermore, as the covariates were not properly pre-specified in the SAP (and age was added as an 
additional covariate), the analysis cannot be considered as fully pre-specified. The applicant provided an 
analysis  without  the  factor  age  as  a  covariate  as  well  as  additional  sensitivity  analyses  with  added 
relevant baseline covariates. The results from the provided sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
primary analysis. 
The  main  issue  in  the  analysis  is  based  on  the  improper  handling  of  missing  evaluable  diaries.  For  a 
considerable number of days the diaries were not evaluable or valid, which may also include completely 
missing diaries. Missing data imputation was neither planned nor performed for these days. Basically, 
the analysis was based on the assumption that the absence of a valid diary (or evaluability of a diary) 
was  completely  at  random  and  the  actual  endpoint  refers  to  a  mixture  of  the  presence  of  relevant 
symptoms (≥ 2) and the evaluability of the diary. Hence, the applicant attempted to justify the validity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 136/148 
 
 
 
and  robustness  of  the  conclusions  with  respect  to  the  large  number  of  non-evaluable  diaries  and 
demonstrate whether the actual analysis yields an unbiased estimation for the relative reduction in days 
with any symptom intensity score ≥ 2, if all diaries were evaluable. 
The robustness of the analysis regarding the large amount of non-evaluable diaries was initially unclear, 
especially  since  a  reference  based  multiple  imputation  approach  was  apparently  not  followed.  The 
applicant was requested to provide a reference based multiple imputation approach that uses the data 
from  the  reference  group  only  to  generate  the  distributions  to  be  used  for  multiple  imputation.    It 
appeared that the first reference-based multiple imputation may have not been performed properly. A 
multiple imputation would require the combination of multiply imputed datasets applying Rubin’s rule. 
The applicant finally provided the requested analysis. It is noted that the point estimate of the rate ratio 
increased slightly, but the confidence interval got much larger and the p-value increased likely due to 
the increased variability of the multiple imputation approach although the result remained statistically 
significant. 
Mechanism and potential plausibility for better GI tolerability  
The mechanism for better DRF GI tolerance compared to DMF and the clinical relevance of the results in 
Study A302 was discussed (please see above in the relevant sections).  
Among the likely reasons for better gastrointestinal-related tolerance were the lower concentration of 
methanol formed, the larger particle size of DRF limiting binding to receptors within the gastrointestinal 
tract, and the lower electrophilicity of DRF. These reasons are all speculative. There is no evidence to 
support  that  any  of  the  presented  mechanisms  are  important  in  the  hypothesised  better  tolerance  of 
DRF. 
A301 (EVOLVE-MS-1) 
The results from Study A301, albeit showing similar efficacy between DRF and DMF, both in terms of 
MRI and clinical efficacy endpoints, are from an open-label, single arm, long term, primarily, safety study 
and are not final. Hence the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Paediatric data 
There  are  no  data  for  DRF  in  the  paediatric  population.  There  are  very  limited  data  for  DMF  in  the 
paediatric population in a total of 34 patients, aged 13-18 years old (completed studies: 109MS202 and 
its extension 109MS311). These limited data collected after administration of DMF are not considered 
useful information to be included in the SmPC of DRF. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
TEAEs  after  DRF  administration  were  reported  by  88.2%  and  78.3%  of  patients  in  Studies  A301  and 
A302, with discontinuations due to TEAEs in 8% and 1.6% of patients and SAEs in 11.4% and 1.6% of 
patients. TEAEs with DRF in Study A301 were qualitatively and quantitatively in line with those after DMF 
administration in study A302 and in the Tecfidera clinical studies. The SOC with the highest proportions 
of subjects reporting TEAEs in A301 were infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, vascular 
disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. The most common TEAEs (occurring in > 10% of patients) in 
study  A301  included  flushing  (27.2%),  MS  relapse  (19%),  URTI  (14.3%),  nasopharyngitis  (12.9%), 
lymphopenia (11.2%), and diarrhoea (10.3%). In study A302, TEAEs were reported most frequently in 
the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, vascular disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
The  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  was  flushing  (36.7%  of  patients  overall),  followed  by  diarrhoea 
(18.8%) and nausea (17.7%).

Serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) are a potential risk with DRF 
treatment.  In  Study  A301,  opportunistic  infections  (i.e.,  candidiasis  and  candida  infections)  were 
reported in 0.6% of patients but none was serious or associated with lymphopenia. The TEAEs of oral 
candidiasis and candida infection were rated related to DRF and all resolved by the clinical cut-off date 
except for the TEAE of candida infection. Serious infections were reported by 0.9% of patients (including 
appendicitis,  cellulitis,  urinary  tract  infection,  chronic  gastritis,  pharyngitis,  pneumonia  bacterial, 
pneumonia,  and  sepsis).  One  serious  infection  (pneumonia  bacterial)  resulted  in  discontinuation  from 
treatment and was fatal. 
Decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts are an important identified risk with DRF consistent with 
DMF, starting at Week 4 through Week 48 with a plateau up to Week 96. Mean decreases from baseline 
were  in  the  same  magnitude  as  with  DMF,  i.e.,  11%  and  30%  for  leukocyte  and  lymphocyte  counts, 
respectively. In A301, 42.4% of subjects had lymphocyte counts below LLN (< 0.91 × 109/L). Half of 
them experienced Grade 2 lymphopenia (< 0.8×109/L to 0.5×109/L) with an infection SAE reported in 
four subjects.  13.7%  of  de  novo  subjects,  16%  of  rollover  subjects  treated  with  DRF  and  11.1%  of 
rollover patients treated with DMF had moderate prolonged lymphopenia for six months. 8.7% and 0.2% 
of patients had Grade 3 and Grade 4 lymphopenia. Severe prolonged lymphopenia defined as ALC < 0.5 
9
×  10
/L  for  more  than  6 months  has  not  been  reported  in  A301  given  that  patients  with  lymphocyte 
9
counts < 0.5 × 10
/L for ≥ 4 weeks were to discontinue DRF according to the protocol. 16.7% of patients 
reported  a  TEAE  in  the  lymphopenia  category  (i.e.,  lymphopenia  and  lymphocyte  count  decreased), 
mainly mild or moderate in severity and rated related to DRF. None of the events was serious. Events 
were reported with a similar incidence in the first and second year of treatment. In less than half of the 
subjects, lymphopenia did not resolve by the data cut-off. Less than 2% of all subjects interrupted or 
discontinued treatment with DRF due to lymphopenia. 0.8% of all patients reported TEAEs in A302 (DRF: 
0.4%, DMF: 1.2%). 
PML is classified as an important identified risk of DRF treatment in line with DMF and lymphopenia is 
known to increase this risk. So far, 12 cases of PML have been confirmed in DMF-exposed subjects with 
lymphocyte  counts  below  LLN  (< 0.91x109/L);  one  case  occurred  in  study  109MS303,  while  the 
remaining 11 cases occurred in the post marketing setting with Tecfidera. Two cases of PML were fatal. 
No case of PML was reported in the DRF clinical study programme. The risk for PML is detailed in the 
product information for DRF in line with DMF. 
Malignancies were reported in 0.5% and pre-malignant conditions were reported in 0.7% of subjects in 
Study  A301.  A  similar  pattern  of  malignancies  was  observed  as  with  Tecfidera.  No  such  events  were 
reported in Study A302. 
Liver injury has been assessed as AESI with DRF treatment given that animal data identified liver toxicity 
with DMF. Increases in liver transaminases and related hepatic events have been reported in the DMF 
clinical programme. Drug-induced liver injury is an important identified risk with DMF and DRF and is 
included as ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Transient asymptomatic increases in liver transaminases 
with DRF were reported within the first 4 weeks of treatment in line with DMF. In a majority of subjects, 
increases were in line with ALT and/ or AST of < 3x ULN. Abnormalities of ALT and/ or AST > 3x ULN, > 
5x ULN, and > 10x ULN occurred in no more than 2% of subjects. TEAEs of liver injury, mainly mild or 
moderate in severity, were reported in 7.2% of patients in Study A301 and most frequently within the 
first  6 months  of  treatment.  The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  laboratory  abnormalities,  i.e., 
ALT increased (5.5%) and AST increased (2.9%), and ADRs are included in SmPC Section 4.8. All other 
events  (also  including  cholestatic  liver  injury,  hepatic  steatosis,  and  hepatosplenomegaly)  were  each 
reported in ≤ 0.5% of patients. In a majority of patients, the events were related to DRF treatment and 
resolved. In few patients, hepatic events were serious or led to discontinuation of DRF. Hepatic TEAEs 
were reported in 5.4% of subjects in Study A302, with similar frequencies in the DRF and DMF group. 
Assessment report

ALT  and  bilirubin  increases  in  line  with  Hy’s  law  were  not  observed  with  DRF.  Baseline  and  routine 
monitoring of liver enzymes is detailed in the SmPC. Moreover, the safety profile in patients with hepatic 
impairment is an area of missing information in the RMP. 
Preclinical studies specified the kidney as a target organ for DMF-toxicity, which likewise applies to DRF. 
However,  DMF  was  not  found  to  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  renal  injury.  There  was  no 
evidence  for  an  impaired  renal  function  with  DRF  treatment  in  Studies  A301  and  A302.  Abnormal 
urinalysis parameters were reported for urine protein, urine ketones and urine occult blood (in 76.6%, 
55.3%, and 37.4% of all patients in study A301) without corresponding to renal TEAEs. 3.4% of patients 
in A301 had a TEAE from the renal injury AESI category with proteinuria reported in a majority of them. 
1.6%  of  subjects  (with  similar  frequencies  for  DRF  and  DMF)  reported  TEAEs  (mainly  proteinuria)  in 
A302. Proteinuria is included as common ADR with DRF and DMF in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition, 
evaluation of DRF safety in subjects with normal eGFR and eGFR indicative of mild renal impairment in 
Study A301 did not suggest clinically significant differences. However, DRF treatment of subjects with 
moderate  and/  or  severe  renal  impairment  is  a  missing  information  in  the  RMP.  In  addition,  the 
interaction with nephrotoxic medications leading to renal toxicity is listed as an important potential risk 
in  the  RMP  for  DRF  in  line  with  DMF,  which  is  based  on  the  results  of  a  subgroup  analysis  within  the 
placebo-controlled  DMF  studies,  i.e.,  an  increased  incidence  of  renal  and  urinary  AEs  (primarily 
proteinuria) in patients with concomitant potentially nephrotoxic medication.  
Gastrointestinal disorders TEAEs (mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and abdominal pain) are among the most 
frequently reported side effects of DMF-containing drug products, with incidences between 33% (in Study 
109MS303) and 48% (in Pool A) for DMF 240 mg BID and in line with data deriving from the psoriasis 
indication (see EPAR of Skilarence EMEA/H/C/002157/0000). Reporting of GI disorders TEAEs with DRF 
in line with DMF was highest during the first three months of treatment and resolved in a majority of 
subjects within one week. In A301, 31.6% reported GI disorders TEAEs, and 0.9% of subjects reported 
serious GI disorders. 1.8% of subjects had a dose reduction/ interruption due to GI events. In Study 
A302, 34.8% of patients in the DRF group and 49% of subjects in the DMF group reported GI disorders 
TEAEs. Gastrointestinal tolerability has been designated as AESI, for which only SAEs and AEs leading 
to discontinuation were taken into account. GI AESIs in A301 were reported in 0.8% of patients and in 
A302, these events were reported more frequently in the DMF group vs. the DRF group (4.8% vs. 0.8%), 
all of them leading to discontinuation. Routine risk minimisation measures to improve GI tolerability with 
DRF (like with DMF) include temporary dose reduction to half the maintenance dose and the intake with 
food. 
TEAEs  of  anaphylaxis  and  angioedema,  both  of  which  have  been  reported  following  Tecfidera 
administration in the post-marketing setting, were not reported during the DRF studies. 
Four deaths were reported in the DRF clinical programme, all in Study A301 (due to pneumonia bacterial, 
fall, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiac arrest). None of the event was rated related to DRF.  
A total of ten pregnancies occurred in the DRF studies, with an outcome reported for eight pregnancies, 
including four full-term healthy infants; two elective abortions (at eight and ten weeks of gestation); and 
two spontaneous abortions. None of the pregnancies was indicative of foetal abnormalities. The impact 
of  DRF  on  pregnancy  outcomes  will  be  evaluated  in  a  prospective  pregnancy  registry  cohort  study 
(272MS401). Effects on pregnancy outcome is listed as an important potential risk for DRF. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555028/2021  
Page 139/148 
 
 
 
Clinical  safety  of  DRF  primarily  relies  on  DMF  data  (Tecfidera  EPAR  EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev  1), 
which is based on the principle of equivalent exposure to MMF after administration of DRF 462 mg BID 
and  DMF  240 mg  BID.  DRF  product-specific  safety  data  are  available  for  1071  subjects,  who  have 
received DRF in the two Phase 3 studies A302 and A301. The short duration of study A302 (5-weeks, 
including a 1-week titration to the final DRF/ DMF dose) hampers evaluation of a number of important 
but  rare  safety  issues,  which  commonly  appear  with  longer  treatment  duration  (i.e.,  AEs  due  to  the 
immunosuppressive  effect  of  DRF,  for  example  lymphocytopenia,  opportunistic  infections,  and 
malignancies).  
Study A301 covers a longer treatment duration (up to 96 weeks); however, with known limitations of an 
open-label design. As of the updated data cut-off 01 September 2020, 65.4% (388/593) of subjects in 
the de novo group had ≥ 24 months of cumulative treatment exposure, and 33.5% (80/239) of subjects 
in the DRF and 35.6% (80/225) of subjects in the DMF Rollover group, respectively, had ≥ 24 months 
of  exposure.  No  unexpected  findings  derived  from  these  additional  safety  data.  152  of  1057  subjects 
(14.4%) were ongoing in A301 after  the updated  data cut-off. Long-term safety data have also been 
collected  for  DMF  in  the  extension  study  109MS303,  which  likewise  informs  on  long-term  safety  with 
DRF.  The  outcome  of  the  assessment  of  this  study  for  DMF  will  also  be  reflected  in  the  DRF  product 
information. 
Safety in special population 
The safety profile of DRF in the treatment of subjects with RRMS has been evaluated in subjects 18 to 
65 years of age with no data available for paediatric subjects (< 18 years of age) and limited data for 
those with a screening age of 65 years in the phase 3 trials. 139 (13.2%) of patients in A301 were > 
55 years  of  age,  with  three  patients  aged  65 years  at  baseline.  Although,  preliminary  DRF  data  from 
A301 do not indicate a different safety profile in the elderly, pivotal DMF source data are only available 
and thus in support of DRF safety for patients up to 55 years of age. Remaining uncertainty in the safety 
profile  in  subjects  between  55 and  65 years  of  age  with  DRF  has  been  addressed.  Analysis  of 
demographics, TEAEs, SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation in patients <55 years of age (N=899) 
vs.  ≥55 years  of  age  (N=158)  did  not  reveal  significant  differences  in  the  safety  profile  except  for 
numerical differences in lymphopenia AEs. Adequate wording is now included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The safety profile of DRF has been evaluated in patients aged 18 to 65 years. No or insufficient safety 
data are available for paediatric subjects (< 18 years of age) and elderly subjects (> 65 years of age). 
The safety profile in patients > 65 years is a missing information in the RMP. 
Uncertainty has been raised with regard to the outcome of three pregnancies reported in the DMF Study 
109MS303  (currently  handled  in  the  ongoing  variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G),  i.e. 
induced abortion due to congenital abnormalities, for which the narratives were insufficient to rule out a 
causality with DMF treatment. The rate of congenital abnormalities in study 109MS303 appears to exceed 
the  background  prevalence  rate  of  a  reference  population  in  EUROCAT.  No  immediate  action  derives 
from  these  three  cases.  However,  a  cumulative  review  of  pregnancies  and  their  outcome  against  the 
background rate in EUROCAT has been requested as part of the next PSUR for DMF, which is at the time 
of this assessment under evaluation in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010143/202103. Congenital abnormalities 
were  not  observed  in  placebo-controlled  clinical  Phase 3  studies  with  Tecfidera  and  were  also  not 
observed in the DRF clinical studies.  
Uncertainty  has  also  been  raised  regarding  the  pharmacologically  inactive  metabolite  HES  due  to  its 
accumulation  with  increasing  renal  impairment.  A  summary  of  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  could 
demonstrate  that  HES  is  biologically  inactive  and  pharmacologically  inert.  The  safety  profile  is  found 
comparable in subjects with renal impairment and those with normal renal function.

A  number  of  safety  signals  or  potential  safety  concerns  derived  from  post  marketing  experience  with 
DMF  but  have  not  been  observed  with  DRF  in  clinical  studies.  These  include  –  amongst  those  listed 
previously - Herpes Zoster, cases of overdose, thrombocytopenia, and Fanconi syndrome. Warnings and 
ADRs have been included in the DRF product information. 
Adverse events (of special interest) 
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  difference  in  reporting  of  the  most  common  GI  tolerability  events  (i.e., 
diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, and vomiting) and discontinuations due to GI 
events as well as GI AESI in the DRF versus the DMF  group in Study A302 is uncertain because:  
- the difference is based on a 5-week treatment duration in A302 (including a 1-week titration to the 
full dose), 
- GI events do not appear to be different for DRF and DMF based on longer treatment durations in study 
A301 (DRF: 31.6%) and in 109MS303 (DMF: ~30% up to the data cut-off 03 August 2011 and 35% 
up to the data cut-off 08 November 2019).  
An  increased  risk  for  infections,  mainly  serious  and  opportunistic  infections  is  a  clinically  significant 
consequence of lymphopenia, especially if it is severe and prolonged. A relation between minimum post-
baseline  lymphocyte  counts  and  the  occurrence  of  infections  was  not  detected  in  additional  analyses 
performed for the DMF phase 3 studies; however, such a relation cannot be excluded for DRF given that 
ALC  <  0.5x109/L  persisting  for  >  4  weeks  led  to  discontinuation  from  treatment.  Moreover,  not  only 
severe but also mild and moderate lymphopenia has been identified as risk factor in a total of 12 PML 
cases confirmed for DMF so far. Eleven of these cases occurred in the post marketing setting given that 
PML due to its rarity is not expected to be reported in clinical trials.  
In this context, uncertainty is raised on the recovery of lymphocyte counts after discontinuation of DRF 
treatment (in line with DMF treatment). Subjects, who completed Study A301 or who terminated early 
with a last measured lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 109/L were followed up every 2 months for a maximum 
of 3 visits or until lymphocyte counts reached normal limits (≥ 0.91x109/L). Recovery of lymphocytes 
was not complete for all of the 85 subjects included within the observation period, i.e., within a maximum 
of 6 months. This is supported by data on lymphocyte recovery in 109MS303 (currently under evaluation 
in EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G). Results indicate that ALC in more than half of these patients recovered 
to ≥ LLN within the follow-up period (up to 48 weeks) in patients with ALC < LLN and ALC < 0.8x109/L 
at recovery baseline. These data did not include subjects with severe prolonged lymphopenia (i.e., ALC 
< 0.5x109/L for more than 6 months). A number of uncertainties have been identified for the datasets 
and statistical analysis underlying this evaluation and further information has been requested. Given that 
the applicant proposes lymphocyte count reconstitution data to be included in Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPCs for Tecfidera  and Vumerity, these discrepancies have to be solved before concluding on  a 
wording, which has been confirmed by the applicant. 
While no concern for DRF over DMF is raised on the risk for malignancies based on DRF study data, this 
long-term risk with DMF treatment has been followed in Study 109MS303; as a consequence, additional 
analyses on malignancies and background rates also focussing on skin cancers have been requested as 
part of the most recent PSUR, which is evaluated in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010143/202103 at the time of 
this assessment. Depending on the outcome and in line with class effects of DMTs, amendments to the 
product information could become necessary, which are also relevant for DRF. Malignancies have been 
included in the list of potential risks associated with DRF in line with DMF.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Since comparative exposure to the common active metabolite MMF from 240 mg of DMF and 462 mg of 
DRF  has  been  shown,  the  efficacy  results  from  the  DMF  clinical  programme  can  be  used  to  support 
efficacy claims for DRF in the same indication, RRMS, and inform dosing. Both prodrugs and DRF undergo 
rapid presystemic conversion to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). The pivotal data (from Studies C-1900, 
109MS301  and  109MS302)  together  with  other  supportive  studies  justified  the  approval  of  Tecfidera 
(DMF) in RRMS (reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1). Hence, it can be assumed that 
DRF will have similar efficacy in comparison to DMF in patients with RRMS. Results from an open label 
long term study still ongoing are indicative of the similarity of efficacy of DMF and DRF. 
However, the claim for additional benefit of improved GI tolerability has not been robustly demonstrated. 
There  are  several  issues  with  the  design,  choice  of  primary  endpoint  and  scales  for  assessing  GI 
tolerability and the analyses of the results in the study used for supporting better GI tolerability of DRF 
compared to DMF. Data to support the underlying hypothesised mechanisms for better GI tolerance for 
DRF were not provided. 
The overall safety database including product-specific DRF safety data from two Phase 3 studies together 
with  DMF 
controlled 
safety  data 
from 
two  pivotal 
studies 
(reference 
is  made 
to 
EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev  1)  and  long-term  safety  data  from  an  8-year  extension  study  in  the 
treatment of adult subjects with RRMS is considered comprehensive. As per the cut off 01 September 
2020,  912  subjects  (86.3%)  and  548  subjects  (51.8%)  received  DRF  for  more  than  12 months  and 
24 months, respectively. In addition, MS integrated clinical study experience with Tecfidera as per the 
latest  available  data  cut-off  26  March  2020  added  1872  and  1604 subjects  with  exposure  to  DMF  for 
1 year  and  2 years,  respectively,  and  426  and  eight subjects  with  exposure  to  DMF  for  10 years  and 
12 years, respectively. 
The safety profile of DRF is qualitatively and quantitatively in line with that of DMF. No unexpected safety 
issues have been identified for DRF.  
The main tolerability issues of DRF and DMF treatment, i.e., flushing and GI events can be mitigated by 
the initial 7-day dose titration with half the maintenance dose at Day 1 (i.e., 231 mg DRF BID), which is 
to be increased to the full dose on Day 7 (i.e. 462 mg DRF BID). Moreover, administration with food was 
found to reduce tolerability issues with DMF (see Section 4.2 of the product information for Tecfidera), 
which similarly applies to DRF. Tolerability events that occur intermittently are manageable by temporary 
dose reduction. 
Improved  GI  tolerability  has  not  been  robustly  demonstrated  for  DRF  over DMF.  Although,  it  appears 
that  GI  tolerability  events  are  less  frequently  observed  with  DRF  as  compared  to  DMF  and  that  such 
events are less often serious or leading to discontinuation of treatment, this is based on a short-term 
comparison  between  DRF  and  DMF  in  Study  A302.  Moreover,  no  clinically  relevant  difference  in  the 
occurrence of GI events can be observed with longer DRF treatment duration as compared to DMF (based 
on the uncontrolled studies) and GI events are known to occur intermittently during treatment. Product-
specific GI data on DRF have been summarised in Section 5.1 in the SmPC. 
AESI, i.e., decreases in lymphocyte and leukocyte counts, as well as renal and hepatic injury, were found 
to  be  manageable  by  routine  clinical  and  laboratory  monitoring  and  treatment  discontinuation,  as 
appropriate.  Information  and  warnings  are  adequately  included  in  the  product  information  and  the 
potential risks and areas of missing information have been included in the RMP of DRF in line with DMF.

The  risk  for  opportunistic  and  serious  infections  (other  than  PML  and  Herpes  Zoster)  is  adequately 
covered in the product information. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is recommended and 
treatment should be suspended in case of a serious infection. Moreover, patients with a serious infection 
should not start treatment. Similarly, it cannot not be ruled out that rare opportunistic infections like 
PML  might  occur  in  the  presence  of  moderate  to  severe  prolonged  lymphopenia.  Additional  risk 
minimisation  measures  for  the  prevention  of  PML  have  been  introduced  for  DMF  following  the  7th 
confirmed  case  of  PML  in  a  patient  with  transient,  mild  lymphopenia  in  the  post  marketing  setting 
(EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63). These include a contraindication in patients with suspected or confirmed PML, 
detailed warnings (stopping rules, additional factors that might increase the risk for PML and demand 
increased  vigilance),  and  description  of  study  findings  for  lymphocyte  subsets  in  Section  4.8.  These 
warnings are likewise included in the DRF PI. 
Limitation  of  safety  data  in  the  elderly  has  been  addressed  and  the  age  cut-off  of  65 years  for  DRF 
(contrasting the age cut-off for Tecfidera of 55 years of age) has been justified based on a comparison 
of  the  safety  profile  in  patients  between  55  and  65 years  of  age  and  patients  <  55 years  of  age.  No 
worsening of the safety profile could be deduced from this comparison in patients > 55 years of age.  
Long-term safety of DRF has been further investigated in the ongoing Study A301 for which the final 
CSR  is  expected  in  Q2/2022.  Thus,  updated  information  on  clinical  safety  as  per  the  data  cut-off 
01 September 2020 does not raise additional concerns. Nevertheless, 14.4% of subjects are still ongoing. 
Given the extent of comparability between DRF and DMF, the long-term safety experience with Tecfidera 
is  relevant  and  supporting.  Some  uncertainties  about  the  unfavourable  effects  of  long-term  DRF 
treatment  derive  from  long-term  treatment  with  DMF  in  Study  109MS303  and  the  outcome  of  its 
assessment  in  the  ongoing  variation  procedure  EMEA/H/C/2601/II/0069/G  will  inform  the  safety 
conclusions on DRF and the labelling in the product information. These include: 
• 
additional  information  on  recovery  of  lymphocyte  counts  after  discontinuation  of  DMF  with 
uncertainty on the datasets underlying this evaluation,  
•  3 cases of congenital malformations; no such cases have been reported with Tecfidera in clinical 
studies so far. Like Tecfidera, Vumerity should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed 
and if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. No immediate action derives 
from these cases. 
• 
the long-term risk for malignancies with DMF treatment; although, the incidence did not increase 
with long-term treatment, a causal relationship can neither be established nor ruled out based 
on the available clinical data. Additional analyses on malignancies and background rates have 
been requested in with focus on skin cancers. 
The  applicant  confirmed  that  the  product  information  will  be  updated  to  reflect  the  outcome  of 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/0069/G. 
Additional  long-term  data  for  DMF  will  be  provided  in  the  context  of  the  PASS  study  109MS401,  a 
multicentre, global, observational study collecting information on safety and drug utilisation of Tecfidera 
when used in routine medical practice, for which the final CSR is expected in Q4/2024. This study aims 
to  address  the  potential  risks  and  missing  information  associated  with  DMF,  for  which  the  results  are 
also applicable to DRF given that the same potential risks and area of missing information apply. 
A further registry-based Category 3 study with the objective to further characterise the long-term safety 
of diroximel fumarate (and dimethyl fumarate), especially with regard to the important potential risks of 
malignancies and serious and opportunistic infections, has been added to the Pharmacovigilance Plan for 
DRF. The applicant committed to submit the study protocol as a stand-alone (MEA) procedure following 
approval  of  the  marketing  authorisation.  Study  details,  including  data  sources,  objectives,  and 
milestones will be specified in that MEA procedure.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In terms of clinical efficacy, the benefit for DRF relies on bioequivalent exposure levels to the principle 
active  moiety  MMF,  which  is  the  same  for  DMF  and  DRF  and  consequently  the  efficacy  and  systemic 
safety  results  from  Tecfidera  (DMF)  can  be  extrapolated  to  Vumerity  (DRF).  The  investigation  of  GI 
tolerability yielded some statistically significant results with questionable design, primary endpoint and 
analyses. The differences in GI adverse events were so small that they cannot be considered clinically 
relevant. Hence it cannot be considered that a better GI tolerability profile of DRF compared to DMF has 
been demonstrated.   
The safety profile of DRF in the proposed indication “treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple  sclerosis”  did  not  present  with  any  unexpected  findings  as  compared  to  DMF,  which  was 
authorised in the EU more than 7 years ago. The RMM proposed for DRF have proven to be efficacious 
for DMF.  
The amount of clinical trial data and post-marketing experience with DMF appears reassuring that the 
safety  of  DRF  is  likewise  manageable  with  the  same  precautionary  measures  in  place  in  the  product 
information and post-authorisation safety measures.  
Despite tolerability issues mainly occurring during initiation of DRF therapy, there are safety concerns to 
be considered with chronic DRF use in line with DMF, i.e., pronounced lymphopenia that increases the 
risk  for  serious/  opportunistic  infections,  including  PML,  but  also  DILI.  The determination  of  the  long-
term  safety  risks  is  still  outstanding  and  will  be  further  addressed  in  the  ongoing  DRF  Phase 3  study 
A301 and in the observational drug utilisation Study 109MS401 with DMF. 
Approval can be recommended. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Vumerity  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  Section 5 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations

the following dosage recommendation in case of renal 
impairment has been updated in section 4.2 and 4.4. 
Forxiga, Edistride: dapagliflozin should not be initiated in 
patients with a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 
mL/min and should be discontinued at GFR persistently 
below 45 mL/min. No dosage adjustment is required based 
on renal function. 
Xigduo, Ebymect: the maximum daily dose of metformin 
should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors 
that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis should be 
reviewed before considering initiation of metformin in 
patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.

and prolonged release exenatide (a GLP 1 receptor agonist) 
was compared to dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release 
exenatide alone in subjects with inadequate glycaemic 
control on metformin alone (HbA1c ≥ 8% and ≤ 12%). All 
treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to 
baseline. The combination treatment with dapagliflozin 10 
mg and prolonged release exenatide group showed superior 
reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared to 
dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release exenatide alone. 
Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged 
release exenatide resulted in significantly greater 
reductions in fasting plasma glucose, in 2 hour post 
prandial glucose, in body weight and systolic blood 
pressure at week 28, as compared to either agent alone.  
These efficacy results were reflected in section 5.1 of the

Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
15 April 2016 the PRAC to assess the impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of canagliflozin containing 
medicinal products of an increase in amputations, 
mostly affecting the toes, observed in an ongoing 
clinical trial (CANVAS) for canagliflozin and a 
numerical imbalance with regards to amputation 
events seen in an ongoing renal study CANVAS-R 
with a similar population as CANVAS. 
Considering that a class effect cannot be excluded, 
the European Commission extended on 6 July 2016 
the scope of the procedure to include all SGLT2 
inhibitors containing medicinal products to allow a 
review of data from the class.  
The PRAC was requested to assess the impact 
thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Invokana, 
Vokanamet, Forxiga, Edistride, Xigduo, Ebymect, 
Jardiance and Synjardy and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing 
authorisation of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
25 January 2016 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency on the adequacy of the current 
recommendations for metformin containing products 
with respect to the use in patients with moderate 
renal failure, taking into account the available 
information on the risk of lactic acidosis. The CHMP 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of metformin containing

the marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The notification for the procedure is appended to this 
opinion.

The up to 4 years safety and efficacy data has been

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC of Xigduo 
(dapaglifozin and metformin) and Forxiga 
(dapaglifozin) in order to reflect the long-term 
findings from  208 weeks (4 years) of administration 
of dapagliflozin as add-on-to metformin compared 
with a sulphonylurea (SU; i.e, glipizide) as add-on to 
metformin. 
reported in the clinical study report of study D1690C00004. 
Based on it the MAH has updated section 5.1 of the SmPC 
of Xigduo (dapaglifozin and metformin) and Forxiga 
(dapaglifozin) in order to reflect the long-term findings 
from 208 weeks of administration of dapagliflozin as add-
on-to metformin compared with a sulphonylurea (glipizide) 
as add-on to metformin. 
The study was designed to show non-inferiority for 
dapagliflozin versus glipizide at 52 weeks and the primary 
endpoint was met. At the end of the first extension period 
(LT1) some deterioration of HbA1c was observed, however,

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

less prominent for dapagliflozin with a between treatment 
difference of  0.18 %. During the LT2 extension, HbA1c 
continued to rise but slower in the dapagliflozin treated 
group than in the glipizide treated group, resulting in a 
between treatment difference of -0.30 % at 208 weeks. 
Overall about 20 % of patients completed the study without 
the need for rescue medication in both treatment groups 
(20 % vs 18 %, dapagliflozin and glipizide respectively) 
thus managed to maintain an acceptable metabolic control 
for four years with either dapagliflozin or glipizide. Due to 
the progressive nature of T2DM it is well known that 
treatment has to be intensified over time and maintaining 
effect over four years is considered clinically relevant albeit 
in a limited proportion of the patients. 
The data also show that the effect of both treatments on 
body weight, which had stabilised for both treatments at 52 
weeks, was maintained over the study duration resulting in 
a decrease in body weight (compared to baseline) of about 
-3.5 kg in the dapagliflozin treated group and a treatment 
difference of 4.38 kg at week 208. 
The safety data provided (up to 208 weeks treatment) 
confirm the safety profile known for dapagliflozin. The most 
common AEs are related to the increased excretion of 
urinary glucose, i.e. genital infections and UTI (urinary 
tract infections); there appears to be no increase in serious 
UTI over time compared to glipizide treatment.  
In conclusion, the data provided support the long-term use 
of dapagliflozin in the treatment of T2DM. The data 
supporting a maintained efficacy, both with regards to 
HbA1c and body weight, over the 208 week study period 
for a relevant proportion of patients is considered of 
relevance for the prescriber and the changes proposed to

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted study 
section 5.1 is therefore accepted.  
This application was submitted for a Type II variation, 
following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
order to reflect the up to 24 weeks safety and 
efficacy results reported in study D1693C00005 
Clinical Study Report (CSR), study that investigated 
dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin and a 
sulphonylurea for the treatment of subjects with 
Type 2 Diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic 
control on a background combination of metformin 
and sulphonylurea. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

D1693C00005 clinical study report (CSR) in order to 
provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of 
dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin and a 
sulphonylurea (SU). Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC were proposed by the MAH in order to reflect the 
up to 24 weeks safety and efficacy results reported in the 
above mentioned study report. 
In the CHMP view, the data from study D1693C00005 show 
compelling efficacy results. A placebo-corrected reduction 
in HbA1c of -0.62 was observed after 24 weeks which is 
considered a clinically relevant effect. This treatment effect 
is within the same range as observed in previously reported 
placebo-controlled studies with dapagliflozin. It can 
therefore be concluded that dapagliflozin is effective in 
combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea. The 
additional effect on body weight and blood pressure is 
noted and welcomed. 
The safety profile reported in this study is similar to the 
already known safety profile.   
The CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance of Xigduo, 
in the approved indication of treatment of type 2 diabetes, 
remains positive.

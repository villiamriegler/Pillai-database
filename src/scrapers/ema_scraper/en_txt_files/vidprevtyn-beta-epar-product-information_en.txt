previous COVID-19 vaccine. VidPrevtyn Beta may be given once as a booster to adults that have 
received prior vaccination series with either mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines (see 
section 5.1). 
2 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of VidPrevtyn Beta in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age 
have not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
VidPrevtyn Beta is for intramuscular injection only after mixing. The preferred site is the deltoid 
muscle of the upper arm.  
Do not inject this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.  
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions on mixing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
octylphenol ethoxylate (trace residual). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an 
anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 
minutes is recommended following vaccination.  
Anxiety-related reactions  
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle 
injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
‐
related 
Concurrent illness  
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay 
vaccination.  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders  
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals.

immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The 
immune response of VidPrevtyn Beta may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. 
Duration of protection  
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials.  
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness  
As with any vaccine, vaccination with VidPrevtyn Beta may not protect all vaccine recipients. 
Excipients  
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Potassium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of VidPrevtyn Beta with other vaccines has not been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is limited experience with use of VidPrevtyn Beta in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
Administration of VidPrevtyn Beta during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential 
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether VidPrevtyn Beta is excreted in human milk.  
No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-
feeding woman to VidPrevtyn Beta is negligible. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of VidPrevtyn Beta administered as a first booster in individuals previously vaccinated 
with a primary series of mRNA-based, adenovirus-vectored or protein-based COVID-19 vaccines 
was evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 clinical study (VAT00002 Cohort 2). This study involved 705 
participants 18 years of age and older who received the vaccine 4 to 10 months after receiving 
primary vaccination. The median duration of safety follow-up was 145 days, with 610 (86.5%) 
participants completing more than 2 months safety follow-up after booster injection.  
The most common adverse reactions with VidPrevtyn Beta were injection site pain (76.2%), 
headache (41.4%), myalgia (37.8%), malaise (33.0%), arthralgia (28.7%), and chills (19.9%).  
The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions 
occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity. 
Additional safety data were collected in 6236 participants in another ongoing phase 3 clinical study 
(VAT00008 Booster Extension). This study involved participants 18 years of age and older having 
received the booster vaccine at least 4 months after receiving primary series vaccination consisting 
mainly of protein-based COVID-19 vaccines. The median duration of safety follow-up in this study 
was  58  days,  with  5211  (84%)  participants  completing  more  than  6  weeks  safety  follow-up  after 
booster injection. The safety profile based on these additional data was consistent with the adverse 
reactions observed in VAT00002 Cohort 2. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following 
frequency convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN04 
Mechanism of action  
VidPrevtyn Beta is an adjuvanted vaccine composed of the soluble trimeric SARS-CoV-2 
recombinant spike (S) protein (B.1.351 strain) stabilised in its prefusion conformation and deleted of 
its transmembrane and intracellular domains. The combination of antigen and adjuvant enhances the 
magnitude of immune response, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity 
Efficacy of VidPrevtyn Beta has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to an 
authorised COVID-19 vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established. 
6 
The clinical immunogenicity of VidPrevtyn Beta given as a first booster injection is being evaluated 
in two clinical studies: VAT00013 (Study 1) in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-primed participants and 
VAT00002 Cohort 2, Beta arm (Study 2) that included participants primed with various types of 
COVID-19 vaccines.  
Immunogenicity results from Study 1 
Study 1 is a randomised, single-blinded multicenter investigator-initiated clinical study, which 
evaluated the immune response induced by a booster dose of either VidPrevtyn Beta or COVID-
19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified/tozinameran) in individuals previously vaccinated with 
2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran). The per-protocol analysis population 
included 143 participants 18 years of age and older primed with 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine (tozinameran) 3 to 7 months prior to receiving VidPrevtyn Beta (N=67), COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) (N=76). The mean age was comparable across groups with 41.4 
and 40.4 years for VidPrevtyn Beta and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran), respectively. 
Age ranged from 20.0 to 69.0 years. The mean duration between the second dose of the primary 
series and the booster dose was comparable across groups, being 171.0 and 174.5 days for 
VidPrevtyn Beta and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran), respectively.   
Among this per-protocol population, samples from prior to vaccination and 28 days after booster of 
114 participants (54 from VidPrevtyn Beta and 60 from COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)) 
were tested by Pseudovirus Neutralisation Assay. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of neutralising 
antibodies 28 days after VidPrevtyn Beta or COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) booster in 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-primed participants were compared. 
Superiority of GMT against Omicron BA.1 was demonstrated for VidPrevtyn Beta group in 
comparison with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) group, see Table 2.

Immunogenicity results from Study 2 
VidPrevtyn Beta given as a booster is being evaluated in an ongoing multicentre phase 3 clinical 
study in participants 18 years of age and older. Per-protocol analysis population included 543 
participants who received VidPrevtyn Beta 4 to 10 months after receiving primary vaccination with 2 
doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) (n=325) or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine 
(nucleoside modified/elasomeran) (n=93), COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (n=94), 
or with 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant])(n=31).  
In the per-protocol analysis population primed with mRNA vaccines and receiving VidPrevtyn Beta 
booster, the mean age of participants was 41.2 years (range 18-83 years); 347 (83.0%) were 18 to 55 
years of age, 71 (17.0%) were 56 years of age and older, 25 (6.0%) were 65 years of age and older. 
Among them, 44.0% were male, 56.0% were female, 67.7% were White, 13.2% were Black or 
African American, 2.6% were Asian, and 1.0% were American Indian or Alaska Native.  
In the per-protocol analysis population primed with adenoviral vector vaccines and receiving 
VidPrevtyn Beta booster, the mean age of participants was 50.4 years (range 24-77 years); 84 
(67.2%) were 18 to 55 years of age, 41 (32.8%) were 56 years of age and older, 17 (13.6%) were 65 
years of age and older. Among them, 52.8% were male, 47.2% were female, 78.4% were White, 
13.6% were Black or African American, 4.0 % were Asian, and 2.4% were American Indian or 
Alaska Native.  
Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring neutralising antibody titres (ID50) against a pseudovirus 
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein from a USA_WA1/2020 isolate with the D614G 
mutation and B.1.351 variant using a SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Neutralisation Assay.  
A booster response to VidPrevtyn Beta was demonstrated regardless of the vaccine used for 
primary vaccination with the Geometric Mean Titres Ratio (GMTR, fold increase) 14 days post-
booster relative to pre-booster against B.1.351 strain ranging from 38.5 to 72.3, and from 14.5 to 
28.6 for D614G strain, see Table 5.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VidPrevtyn Beta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated 
dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity was observed for the adjuvant based on in vitro and in vivo tests. Genotoxicity of 
the antigen was not evaluated, as its biological nature is not expected to have genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed. 
Reproductive toxicity and fertility 
In a developmental and reproductive toxicity study, 0.5 mL of a vaccine formulation containing up to 
15 micrograms (three human doses) of recombinant protein adjuvanted with AS03 was administered 
to female rabbits by intramuscular injection on five occasions: 24 and 10 days prior to mating and on 
gestation days 6, 12 and 27.  No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, embryo/foetal or 
postnatal development were observed up to postnatal day 35. In this study, high S-specific anti-
SARS-CoV-2 IgG response was detected in maternal animals, as well as in foetuses and pups, 
indicating placental transfer of the maternal antibodies. No data are available on vaccine excretion in 
milk.

1.  What VidPrevtyn Beta is and what it is used for 
VidPrevtyn Beta is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19. 
VidPrevtyn Beta is given to adults who previously received either mRNA or adenoviral vector 
COVID-19 vaccine. 
The vaccine stimulates the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce specific 
antibodies that work against the virus, giving protection against COVID-19. None of the ingredients 
in this vaccine can cause COVID-19. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive VidPrevtyn Beta 
Do not use VidPrevtyn Beta:  
If you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6);  
If you are allergic to octylphenol ethoxylate, a substance that is used in the manufacturing process. 
Small amounts of this substance may remain after manufacturing.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:  
• 
you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were 
given VidPrevtyn Beta in the past;  
you have ever fainted following any needle injection; 
you have a severe illness or infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). However, you can 
have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.  
you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots. 
you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency) or you are using medicines that 
weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or cancer medicines).  
• 
• 
• 
•

As with any vaccine, VidPrevtyn Beta may not fully protect all those who receive it. It is not known 
how long you will be protected. 
Children and adolescents 
VidPrevtyn Beta is not recommended for children aged under 18 years. Currently there is no 
information available on the use of VidPrevtyn Beta in children and adolescents younger than 18 
years of age. 
Other medicines and VidPrevtyn Beta

medicines or vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines  
Some of the side effects of VidPrevtyn Beta mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may 
temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before 
you drive or use machines. 
VidPrevtyn Beta contains sodium and potassium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’.  
3. 
How VidPrevtyn Beta is given 
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle, usually in your upper arm. 
You will receive one injection. 
It is recommended that you receive VidPrevtyn Beta once as a booster dose at minimum 4 months 
following the prior vaccination series with either mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
After the injection, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to 
monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most of the side effects occur within 3 days of getting the vaccine and go away within a few days of 
appearing. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Step 1: Place the vials at room temperature (up to 25 °C) for a minimum of 15 minutes before 
mixing, protecting them from light. 
Step 2: Invert (without shaking) each vial and inspect them visually for any particulate matter or 
discoloration. If either of these conditions exist, do not administer the vaccine. 
Step 3: After removing the flip-off caps, cleanse both vial stoppers with antiseptic swabs. 
Step 4 
Using a sterile 21-gauge or narrower needle 
and a sterile syringe, withdraw the entire 
contents from the adjuvant vial (yellow cap) 
into a syringe. Invert the adjuvant vial to 
facilitate the withdrawal of the full contents.

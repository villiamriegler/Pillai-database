2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma, which is a malignant disorder of the plasma cells, is diagnosed in approximately 
114,000 patients per year worldwide, which includes over 33,000 patients from the European Union. The 
median age of patients at diagnosis is 65 years and the disease has a typical course characterized by a 
chronic phase and several relapses leading to an aggressive terminal phase. Progress, such that survival 
of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma has increased from approximately 3 years with no 
improvement from the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years today (Moreau 2015).  
Despite these advances, multiple myeloma remains incurable. All patients eventually relapse. With each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases. After relapse 
from PIs and IMiDs, patients are often retreated with drugs that have the same mechanism of action. 
Ultimately, the disease becomes refractory. Patients who are heavily pretreated and/or refractory to both 
a PI and IMiD have a dismal prognosis, are difficult to get back into a durable remission, and median 
survival is only between 8 to 9 months (Kumar 2012; Usmani 2015, Verelst 2015). The relapsed and 
refractory setting represents a serious and life threatening disease with an unmet medical need. 
First line treatment options contain at least one of the novel therapies, i.e. proteasome inhibitors and/or 
immunostimulatory drugs, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), if indicated.  In 
Europe, bortezomib, thalidomide (as first line treatment) and lenalidomide are approved in combination 
regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma.   
Relapsed and/or refractory patients typically receive salvage therapy (if possible, this could include (2nd) 
autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) until relapse or toxicity and then go 
onto the next salvage option. In this setting, for patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies, 
including bortezomib and an IMiD, and have shown relapsed or refractory disease, pomalidomide (in 
combination with dexamethasone) and panobinostat (in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone) are approved agents in the EU. The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the monoclonal 
antibody elotuzumab both in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone were approved in the EU 
for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.  
In patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome 
inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy there are not any treatment options, other than the physician’s best choice and palliative care.  
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein expressed 
at a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types and tissues at 
various levels. CD38 protein has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, signalling and 
enzymatic activity (SmPC section 5.1). 
Daratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells. 
Based on in vitro studies, daratumumab may utilize multiple effector functions, resulting in immune 
mediated tumour cell death. These studies suggest that daratumumab can induce tumour cell lysis 
through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 8/119 
 
 
 
 
 
and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of 
myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells 
(CD38+Bregs) are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell lysis (SmPC section 5.1). 
Daratumumab induced apoptosis in vitro after Fc mediated cross linking. In addition, daratumumab 
modulated CD38 enzymatic activity, inhibiting the cyclase enzyme activity and stimulating the hydrolase 
activity. The significance of these in vitro effects in a clinical setting, and the implications on tumour 
growth, are not well-understood (SmPC section 5.1). 
The sponsor applied for the following indication: Daratumumab Janssen-Cilag is indicated for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a 
proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy. 
The recommended indication for approval is: DARZALEX as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome 
inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy (SmPC section 4.1) 
The recommended dose is Daratumumab Janssen-Cilag 16 mg/kg body weight administered as an 
intravenous infusion weekly (weeks 1 to 8) then once every two weeks (weeks 9 to 24) and once every 
four weeks from week 25 onwards until disease progression (SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Daratumumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1κ (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
extracellular domain of human CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein.  
The daratumumab finished product is supplied as a sterile 20 mg/mL liquid concentrate for solution for 
infusion in a Type I glass vial. After dilution in commercially available 0.9% sodium chloride, the product 
is intended for intravenous infusion. Two presentations are proposed for marketing authorisation: packs 
of 5 mL and 20 mL vials (one vial each). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Daratumumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The intact molecule contains 2 
identical heavy chains (HC) of 452 amino acids (approximately 51 kDa each) and 2 identical kappa light 
chains (LC) of 214 amino acids (approximately 24 kDa each). The 4 chains are linked together by covalent 
disulfide bonds and non-covalent protein-protein interactions.  
The amino acid sequences were deduced by the Applicant from the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid 
(cDNA) sequence and confirmed by peptide mapping. The disulfide bonds were predicted from the 
expected pairings for a human IgG1 antibody and confirmed by peptide mapping. The N-linked glycans 
(glycosylation site located at HC Asn302) were shown to be bi-antennary structures typical for an IgG1 
antibody expressed in CHO cells by oligosaccharide mapping with mass spectrometry analysis. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 9/119 
 
 
 
 
A concentrated viral inactivation and neutralisation (VIN) intermediate is manufactured by Biogen Inc. in 
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. The daratumumab active substance is manufactured by Janssen 
Biologics (Ireland) in Cork, Ireland, and is designated as active substance.  
Daratumumab active substance is manufactured in an 11-stage process consisting of fed batch cell 
culture followed by purification with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation and filtration steps. 
Formulation also takes place at the active substance level. The concentrated viral inactivation and 
neutralisation (VIN) intermediate is obtained at Stage 5b. 
There are 2 types of in-process controls (IPCs) in the daratumumab active substance process: (1) an IPC 
with an Acceptance Criterion, and (2) an IPC with a Predefined Instruction. 
A list of IPCs with acceptance criteria used in the daratumumab active substance manufacturing process 
is provided. It includes a list of the process step in which the IPC test is performed, the test, and the 
associated acceptance criterion. Acceptance criteria that are exceeded must be investigated and may 
result in batch rejection. IPC tests for bioburden also have associated action limits that when exceeded, 
require response, investigation, and correction. 
After Stage 5b, the concentrated VIN material is frozen at for up to and transported from Biogen Inc. 
(BIIB), USA to Janssen Biologics, Ireland for further processing. Release and stability acceptance criteria 
are established for the stored VIN intermediate and cover testing of relevant quality attributes. 
Process Validation and/or Evaluation 
Consideration of the process validation and process evaluation efforts began during development. The 
daratumumab active substance manufacture is developed by QbD concepts. Daratumumab critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) have been identified based on the quality target product profile (QTPP) for the finished 
product and scientific knowledge of the monoclonal antibodies. Based on process development and 
clinical manufacturing experience, criticality assessments were performed and critical quality attributes 
(CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls (IPCs), and process monitoring tests 
(PMTs) were identified. Process parameter control ranges and acceptance criteria were established for 
CPPs and IPCs, respectively, to control CQAs according to predetermined CQA specifications, and were 
the basis of a high level process validation master plan and validation acceptance criteria in subordinate 
protocols. The identified CQAs represent the focal point for the subsequent control strategy development.  
Process validation and evaluation studies were executed at both manufacturing and reduced scales 
according to the process validation master plan. Process intermediate hold times, chromatography resin 
lifetimes, and reprocessing steps at specific stages of the active substance process were validated in 
studies according to subordinate protocols. Resin lifetime limits will be verified during commercial 
processing until the maximum number of cycles or total contact time validated using reduced scale 
cycling studies is reached. 
Following process validation, criticality assessments were repeated as part of the lifecycle management of 
the active substance manufacturing process. Reduced scale models were employed to evaluate and 
establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for parameters that were not challenged at manufacturing 
scale. Results from clinical manufacturing, process validation, and reduced scale studies were assessed to 
establish the final list of CPPs for the commercial-scale active substance manufacturing process. 
An integrated control strategy for each stage of the daratumumab active substance manufacturing 
process as well as the control strategy for each of the identified CQAs are outlined. The overall control 
strategy includes relevant elements such as control of process parameters and process monitoring tests 
(PMT), which are established to ensure consistent process stage performance. Control of material 
attributes that enter the manufacturing process like e.g. raw materials, culture media and buffers, WCB 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 10/119 
 
 
 
 
and process intermediates are controlled. The concentrated VIN intermediate, which is stored frozen and 
transported from Biogen Inc, USA to Janssen Biologics, Ireland, is controlled by a release specification 
based on batch data, process validation and stability tests. 
Manufacturing Process Development 
The CMC strategy for comparability included an evaluation of QC batch release results and additional 
biochemical, biophysical, and biological characterisation data according to the guidance provided in ICH 
Q5E. A comparison of degradation pathways and degradation rates was also included in comparability 
studies.  
Characterisation 
The analytical characterisation of daratumumab includes a comprehensive analysis of its biochemical, 
biophysical and biological properties using a wide variety of orthogonal techniques.  
The results showed that daratumumab has the expected structure of an IgG1 antibody. It has specificity 
for CD38 antigen binding in the Fab region and bioactivity via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
and ADCC mechanisms in the Fc region. All product-related substances and impurities were also 
characterised. The results from these forced degradation studies, along with the analysis of structural 
models, release and stability data, and clinical serum samples were used to identify critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) for daratumumab and develop the appropriate process and analytical control strategy. 
Process-related impurities have been identified and their removal was demonstrated by testing during 
process validation. All process validation protocol acceptance criteria were met, and the active substance 
process was demonstrated to remove the process-related impurities. Therefore, tests and specifications 
for these impurities were not established for active substance release. 
As part of demonstrating consistency of the daratumumab production process, batches and have also 
been characterised. 
Specification 
Release and stability testing of the active substance includes identity, purity, charge heterogeneity, 
glycan profile, potency safety and other general tests. 
Results are presented for active substance batches of Phase 3 material, process validation batches, and  
post-process validation batches. All of these batches are representative of the commercial manufacturing 
process. All the results met the commercial release specifications presented in Table 3 above. 
Stability 
Batches of active substance were placed in the stability monitoring programs to establish shelf life. All 
these batches were manufactured at full scale and by the commercial manufacturing process. The 
stability studies with active substance were conducted using small polycarbonate vials representative of 
the large-scale active substance storage containers. 
The quality of active substance clinical- and process validation (and post-process validation) batches 
placed in the stability program is monitored using multiple analytical procedures, each with an established 
stability acceptance criterion.  
The shelf life for active substance is based on   stability data generated at the recommended storage 
condition of. The shelf-life claim is based on an ongoing stability program for Phase 3 clinical and process 
validation batches. A statistical trending approach for analysing the real-time stability data is utilized for 
supporting the shelf life to as per ICH Q1E: Guidance on Statistical Treatment of Stability Data. Stability 
data obtained from accelerated and stressed storage temperature conditions are also presented in 
support of the shelf-life claim.

Based on the data provided a shelf life of 18 months for the finished product (unopened vials) when stored 
at the recommended temperature of 2-8 ºC and protected from light is considered acceptable. 
Regarding in-use stability, from a microbiological point of view, unless the method of opening/ dilution 
precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used

immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and should be no more 
than 24 hours at refrigerated conditions (2 °C - 8 °C) protected from light, followed by 15 hours (including 
infusion time) at room temperature (15°C - 25°C) and room light. 
Adventitious agents 
During cell line development, rabbit serum and fetal bovine serum have been used. No animal-derived 
materials, however, have been used to prepare the master cell bank or working cell banks. 
Mycoplasma and microbial bioburden are controlled through use of a sanitary process design and 
appropriate testing. Bioburden and endotoxin contamination is also evaluated as part of routine testing. 
Manufacturing procedures and 0.2-µm filtration steps throughout the process minimize the risk of 
microbial contamination. 
Viral clearance is achieved through different steps in the purification process. 
A viral safety factor for retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) in the manufacturing process was calculated from 
viral clearance values using xenotropic murine leukaemia virus (XMuLV), a specific model virus for the 
RVLP in the production CHO cell line used for clinical and commercial manufacturing.  
The manufacturing process provides sufficient removal capacity. 
With regard to non-specific model virus studies, cumulative minimum clearances were demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the Quality dossier is of high quality. No major issues were identified during the review. 
Active substance 
The preparation of the MCB, WCB and Extended End of production cell bank (EEPCB) are described. These 
cell banks were characterised according to current guidelines to show their identity and freedom from 
adventitious agents. On request the generation and use of the, in total, three WCBs, has been described. 
The first WCB generated was only used for the manufacture of the very early clinical material. The second 
WCB is currently used for production. A third WCB has been generated and will replace the second one, 
once it has depleted. A clear procedure to prepare future WCBs has been presented on request. Finally, 
EEPCB preparation has been described in sufficient detail.  
Several concerns were raised in relation to the Viral Inactivation and Neutralisation (VIN) intermediate in 
the active substance manufacturing process. Pooling of VIN intermediates thawed and pooled for further 
processing into active substance has been addressed. The strategy for VIN intermediate selection has 
been described. The acceptance criteria for the VIN intermediate have been aligned with manufacturing 
experience. 
On request a protocol for the VIN intermediate stability has been presented, which includes release and 
shelf-life acceptance criteria. 
The Applicant agreed to introduce a test for protein concentration to the VIN intermediate release 
specification, and a measure for fragments into the stability specification for the VIN intermediate. 
Careful product- and process development has been done with the use of all elements of QbD. CQAs has 
been identified. Most of the manufacturing process development work is described at high level, e.g. 
DoE’s are described and results summarised but only very limited real data is presented. A reasonable 
and expected number and type of critical process parameters has been identified and no broad production 
or control flexibility is requested. Some steps of the process have, on a risk-based level, been chosen

(production bioreactor, VIN intermediate and CEX) for more detailed review. A number of issues, for 
these steps needed further justification and/or clarification. This has been provided and do not call for 
comments.  
Based on updated active substance stability data, the claimed shelf-life for active substance when stored 
at is accepted. 
Finished product 
The use of tolerance intervals, as a statistical tool to set finished product (and active substance) 
specification acceptance criteria, called for concern but a justification was provided and the issue was 
considered resolved.  
On request the Applicant has discussed the proposed acceptance criteria for all methods included in the 
finished product specification, taking into account the clinically qualified levels. The specification for 
potency (CDC and ADCC) and charge heterogeneity has been revised and is considered acceptable. 
Acceptance criteria in the active substance specification have been revised accordingly.  
Altogether, the data presented support the Daratumumab finished product shelf life claim of 18 months 
when stored at 2-8 ºC and protected from light. However, the Applicant is recommended to continue the 
stability studies on two 400 mg/vial finished product batches (engineering and clinical) and finished 
product 400 mg/vial process validation batches () stored at 2-8 ºC in order to confirm the stability profiles 
of these batches. Should any unexpected issues arise during the studies it is recommended that it is 
reported to the Rapporteur and the Agency immediately.  
Adventitious agents 
Two minor issues needed to be solved: the Applicant was asked to provide i) retrovirus-like particles 
estimation for three unprocessed cell culture supernatant; and ii) raw data for Adventitious agents safety 
evaluation. These data were provided and the issues were considered resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Darzalex is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Darzalex is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. However, a quality Recommendation has been made. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended a point for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pivotal nonclinical safety studies were conducted in conformance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).  
Daratumumab binds to human and chimpanzee CD38, but not to CD38 of species typically used for 
nonclinical toxicology testing, ie, mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and cynomolgus and rhesus monkey. Therefore, 
another anti-CD38 mAb, HuMab-CD38, that binds human and cynomolgus monkey CD38 was also 
characterized and used in some exploratory studies. Normal human cells, cell lines expressing human 
CD38, and patient derived cells were used in vitro or in immunosuppressed mouse models for the pivotal 
pharmacology studies. Cynomolgus monkeys were used in pilot studies of HuMab-CD38.  
Nonclinical PK of daratumumab was evaluated in the 6-week repeat-dose chimpanzee toxicology study. 
PK of HuMab-CD38 was evaluated in the 2-week repeat-dose pilot cynomolgus monkey toxicology study. 
The toxicology program for daratumumab consisted of a GLP 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study in 
chimpanzees, and in vitro tissue cross-reactivity studies using chimpanzee and human tissues. Additional 
supportive studies were conducted with HuMab-CD38, a mAb that binds cynomolgus CD38, and included 
a pilot, non-GLP 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, and an in vitro tissue 
cross-reactivity study with cynomolgus monkey tissues. Both in vivo repeat-dose studies utilized the 
intended clinical route of administration (ie, intravenous  infusion). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Binding characterization to human CD38 
The CD38 epitope for binding of daratumumab was determined using the PEPSCAN method which showed 
that daratumumab bound to the C-terminal region of human CD38, amino acid [aa] 267 to 280) in 
combination with region aa 233 to 246. In addition, epitope mapping was done by site-directed 
mutagenesis which showed that the binding of daratumumab to CD38 is sensitive to mutations at 
positions 272 and 274 in the CD38 protein (Study GMB 3003-008). 
The kinetics of daratumumab interaction with human CD38 were investigated by Biacore analysis, which 
revealed specific, saturable, and high-affinity binding, with a KD of 4.36x10-9 M (Study GMB 3003-002). 
HuMab-CD38 interaction with human CD38 showed a KD of 8.18 x10-10 M. 
ELISA analysis confirmed that daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 bind to hCD38 in a similar, 
concentration-dependent manner. EC50 of daratumumab binding to hCD38 was achieved at 55.2 ng/mL 
(GMB 3003-002). 
The binding of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 to cell surface-expressed CD38 was characterized by flow 
cytometry using Daudi cells, CHO transfected cells (CHO-CD38 cells), MM-derived cell lines and freshly 
isolated MM tumour cells. Daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 bound in a specific, dose-dependent manner. 
The EC50 values for binding to Daudi and CHO-CD38 cells were 0.26 and 0.47 μg/mL for daratumumab, 
and 0.99 and 0.96 μg/mL for HuMab-CD38, respectively (GMB 3003-002). 
Mechanism of action 
The binding of daratumumab to CD38 on the surface of tumour cells and engagement/ligation of the Fc 
domains of bound antibodies leads to multiple biologic effects, including CDC, ADCC, ADCP, tumour cell

apoptosis, and modulation of CD38 enzymatic activity in patient derived cells and cell lines expressing 
human CD38. 
Induction of Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity 
The capacity of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 to induce CDC was studied in vitro using several cell 
types and cell lines (GMB 3003-003): 
Lysis of Daudi-luc cells: Daratumumab induced CDC with maximum lysis of 60%, whereas the surrogate 
antibody HuMab-CD38 was inefficient in inducing lysis, and did so only at very high concentrations. 
Table 1: Maximal lysis and mean EC50 values against Daudi-luc cells 
Lysis of CD38-Transfected CHO Cells:  
Table 2: Maximal lysis and mean EC50 values against CD38-expressing CHO cells 
a Max lysis expressed as %. EC 50 values expressed as µg/ml 
Lysis of freshly-isolated MM cells: In 8 out of 12 evaluable tumour cell samples, daratumumab-induced 
lysis was greater than 48%. In the remaining four tumour cell samples, poor lysis was observed (<23%). 
With HuMab-CD38 (all forms), only two patients responded at the level of approximately 30% lysis. The 
mechanism underlying the differences in cell lysis among the patient-derived cells is not known, as levels 
of CD38 expression were not characterized. 
Induction of Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity 
Target cells were loaded with 51Cr, incubated with antibody and effector cells, and lysis was determined by 
measuring 51Cr release (GMB 3003-004). In studies using the Daudi cell line, daratumumab induced 
ADCC with an average EC50 of 20.9 ng/mL, compared to HuMab-CD38 (52.5 ng/mL) and rituximab (55.3 
ng/mL). Similar results were seen in assays using MM-derived cell lines. 
In freshly isolated myeloma cells, both CD38 Ab induced ADCC, although the extent of maximal lysis 
differed per tumour sample and was influenced by the origin of effector cell (PBMC from healthy 
volunteers). 
Induction of Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 16/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To evaluate the capacity of daratumumab to stimulate tumour cell phagocytosis in vivo, variant forms of 
daratumumab were created to either eliminate complement-activating function by altering a residue in 
the Fc domain (DARA-K322A), or to reduce phagocytosis-stimulatory function through isotype switching 
to the IgG2 equivalent (DARA-IgG2-K322A). 
In a subcutaneous (SC) mouse model using Daudi-luc tumour cells, DARA-K322A provided stronger 
inhibition of tumour growth than the DARA-IgG2-K322A isoform, which has impaired 
phagocytosis-stimulatory capacity. Furthermore, in the IV leukemic Daudi-luc xenograft model, in which 
mice were treated at the time of tumour challenge, DARA-K322A also showed stronger tumour growth 
inhibition compared to DARA-IgG2-K322A  
To translate these observations from the mouse to a human setting, daratumumab –dependent 
phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages was demonstrated ex vivo in 11 out of 12 
patient-derived MM cells tested, even at low CD38 expression level (35,000 molecules/cell) (Study GMB 
3003-115). Although a clear relationship between expression levels of CD38 and susceptibility to 
phagocytosis was not evident, MM cells from one patient with very low CD38 expression (~10,000 
molecules/cell) were not susceptible to daratumumab-dependent phagocytosis. 
Figure 1: Induction of patient myeloma cell phagocytosis by human macrophages 
Effects on CD38 Enzymatic Activity 
The effect on the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38 was evaluated by three methods, either by 
incubation with recombinant CD38 (figure 2.1.5 A) or cellular CD38 (figure 2.1.5 B) in assays using 
nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) or 8NH2-cADPR as substrate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 17/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In studies using NGD as a substrate, daratumumab, but not HuMab-CD38, induced a 
concentration-dependent inhibition of cyclase activity. Daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 inhibited 
8NH2-cADPR production in a concentration dependent manner. 
The effect of daratumumab on cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38 was measured by HPLC to determine the 
amount of ADPR produced from cADPR, or by measuring the amount of 32P-ADPR produced from 
32P-cADPR by thin layer chromatography. Results suggest that daratumumab stimulated cADPR 
hydrolysis (EC50 of 1.2 µg/ml).  
Induction of Apoptosis 
The capacity of daratumumab to directly induce apoptosis of CD38-expressing cells was studied in a 
series of experiments employing either Ramos or luciferase-transfected Daudi (Daudi-luc) cells (Study 
GMB3003-011). Results of these initial studies suggest that daratumumab (1 µg/mL) is able to induce 
target cell apoptosis upon binding to cell-surface CD38, and that this effect requires cross-linking of the 
Fc domains. 
Because FcγR-mediated antibody crosslinking may be induced by various FcγR-expressing cell types such 
as polymorphonuclear cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells, depending on the 
tumour niche, in vivo studies were performed in a syngeneic peritoneal tumour model in NOTAM mice and 
FcRγ-chain knockout (FcRγ-/-) mice. NOTAM mice have normal surface expression of all activating FcγRs, 
however without signaling capacity due to a signaling-deficient FcR-associated γ-chain. Leukocytes in the 
NOTAM mice are therefore capable of FcγR-mediated antibody crosslinking, without inducing cytotoxicity 
via ADCC or phagocytosis. Leukocytes in FcRγ-/- mice lack expression of all activating FcγRs and solely 
express the inhibitory FcγRIIb. Daratumumab-mediated CDC induction was excluded by using the K322A 
mutant form of daratumumab, which lacks CDC activity ((DARA-K322A). CD38-transduced EL4-CD38 
cells were inoculated intraperitoneally (IP) and treated with DARA-K322A (~0.1 mg/kg). DARA-K322A 
induced an increase in Annexin-V positive cells and significantly increased the number of 7-AAD positive 
cells following 4 h incubation in the FcRγ-/- mice. This indicates that DARA-K322A crosslinking via the 
inhibitory FcγRIIb was sufficient to induce tumour cell apoptosis in vivo. In NOTAM mice, DARA-K322A 
treatment also significantly increased the number of Annexin-V positive and 7-AAD positive cells. 
The inhibitory FcγRIIb and also the activating murine FcγRs, FγRI, FcγRIII and FcγRIV, can mediate 
daratumumab crosslinking in vivo, leading to apoptosis. 
In Vivo Anti-Tumour Effects of Daratumumab 
The effect of daratumumab on the growth of human lymphoma cells in vivo was investigated by 
engrafting luciferase-transfected Daudi cells (Daudi-luc, originated from Burkitt’s lymphoma) into SCID 
mice by IV injection, followed by treatment with daratumumab, HuMab-CD38, or controls (GMB 
3003-007). In the first study, antibodies (300 μg per mouse, n = 4 or 5) were administered one week 
after IV inoculation of Daudi-luc tumour cells, and tumour burden was followed by optical imaging. Both 
daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 significantly reduced tumour growth compared to control treatment on 
Days 28 and 34 (P <0.001). On Day 55 after inoculation, tumour burden after treatment with 
HuMab-CD38 was slightly lower than after treatment with daratumumab (P <0.01); however, values for 
neither the daratumumab nor the HuMab-CD38 group were different from the rituximab control group.  
In the second therapeutic study, antibodies (10 μg per mouse, 0.5 mg/kg body weight, n = 6) were 
administered 14 days after IV inoculation of Daudi-luc tumour cells. At the end of the study (Day 49), 
tumour burden in both the daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 groups was reduced compared to control (P 
<0.05; and was not different from the rituximab control group. 
Species selection 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016

To support nonclinical studies, the binding of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 (a human IgG1 mAb that 
specifically binds human and cynomolgus monkey CD38, also referred as HuMab-3003-003) to human 
and animal tissues and cells was characterized by flow cytometry, ELISA and IHC. Daratumumab binds to 
human and chimpanzee CD38, but not to CD38 of species typically used for nonclinical testing, (mouse, 
rat, rabbit, pig, and cynomolgus and rhesus monkey). HuMab-CD38 functional activity was also 
characterized in some exploratory studies.  
Binding to human lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues 
Daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 were characterized with respect to their specific cellular staining of 
lymphoid and non-lymphoid human tissue (Study GMB 3003-006). Results of immunohistochemical 
analyses showed that both antibodies bound to lymphocytes (T- and B-lymphocytes, plasma B cells), 
macrophages and lymphatic endothelium as expected. Both antibodies also bound to CD38 on myocytes 
(in striated muscle) and a subset of differentiated epithelium in lung; HuMab-CD38 was also shown to 
bind to differentiated epithelium in prostate and fallopian tube.  
Reactivity to human and Cynomolgus blood cells 
The binding of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 to individual cell types in human and cynomolgus monkey 
blood was studied in vitro by flow cytometry (Study SR3003-06-31). Distinct differences in the binding of 
daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 to the various cell types were identified. Daratumumab did not show 
specific binding to any cynomolgus monkey cell types. Both daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 bound 
weakly to human B and T cells. In contrast, HuMab-CD38 bound strongly to cynomolgus monkey B and T 
lymphocytes. Neither daratumumab nor HuMab-CD38 showed specific binding to human or cynomolgus 
monkey granulocytes. 
Daratumumab has a low level of binding to human erythrocytes. In contrast, HuMab-CD38 bound to 
cynomolgus monkey erythrocytes at concentrations > 3 µg/mL. Overall, higher binding of HuMab-CD38 
to cynomolgus monkey blood cells was seen and it may suggest higher levels of CD38 expression in 
monkey vs. human peripheral blood cells, which could be an important consideration in interpreting 
results of nonclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Comparison of Daratumumab interaction with human and chimpanzee CD38 and with blood cells 
The coding sequence of chimpanzee CD38 was determined and compared to hCD38. The cDNA of 
chimpanzee and human CD38 was highly similar, without insertions and with only 4 AA differences (not 
within the daratumumab binding epitope). Daratumumab was found to bind equally well to chimpanzee 
and human CD38 in vitro, when assessed using purified CD38 protein (ELISA) and using Pan EBV3 cells 
and human B cells (flow cytometry). Furthermore, by means of surface plasmon resonance (Biacore), the 
affinities of daratumumab for hCD38 (KD = 3.50 x 10-9 M + 1.66 x 10-9 M) and for chimpanzee CD38 (KD 
= 4.46 x 10-9 M + 1.66 x 10-9 M) were found not to be significantly different. Daratumumab was found 
to inhibit the enzyme activity of both chimpanzee and hCD38 to the same extent (Study GMB 3003-014). 
The binding of daratumumab to chimpanzee CD38 was further characterized by flow cytometric analysis 
of chimpanzee PBMCs (BKV00001). Daratumumab binding was identified on CD4, CD8 or CD56-positive 
lymphocytes in both human and chimpanzee PBMCs. The percentages of positive cells for each of these 
lymphocyte subsets were comparable between human and chimpanzee, indicating that daratumumab is 
able to bind to naturally-occurring chimpanzee CD38. 
Furthermore, binding of daratumumab to human and chimpanzee platelets was characterized by flow 
cytometry (BKV00013 and BKV00015). The binding experiments revealed that chimpanzee platelets 
express a daratumumab binding site with an affinity (EC50 value) of approximately 1 µg/mL, which is not 
expressed on human platelets. The binding affinity on human platelets could not be determined in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 19/119 
 
 
 
 
tested concentration range, since a maximal binding plateau was not reached. It is assumed that the 
binding affinity of daratumumab to human platelets is at least 15-fold lower than to chimpanzee platelets.  
Anti-tumour effects of Daratumumab in combination with other therapeutic agents 
The effects of combining daratumumab with other therapeutic agents that are currently used for the 
treatment of MM were evaluated in two ex vivo studies. Daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide 
(Study GMB 3003-069): a synergistic interaction was identified between lenalidomide and 
daratumumab-induced tumour cell lysis in treated samples of bone marrow mononuclear cells from MM 
patients. 
Addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib increased MM cell lysis by more than 
two-fold in all combinations (p < 0.001). Combination of daratumumab with either lenalidomide/ 
bortezomib/ dexamethasone cocktail or melphalan/ prednisone/ bortezomib cocktail resulted in 
significantly increased tumour cell lysis compared to cocktail alone (Study GMB 3003-070). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Anti-tumour effects of daratumumab in combination with other therapeutic agents ex vivo 
The effects of combining daratumumab with other therapeutic agents that are currently used for the 
treatment of MM were evaluated in two ex vivo studies. The first study addressed the activity of 
daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide, an immune modulatory drug, against MM cells (Study 
GMB 3003-069). Daratumumab-dependent killing of purified primary MM cells and the UM-9 myeloma cell 
line by ADCC was significantly augmented (approximately two-fold) by lenalidomide pre-treatment of 
effector PBMCs. Furthermore, a synergistic interaction was identified between lenalidomide and 
daratumumab-induced tumour cell lysis in treated samples of bone marrow mononuclear cells from MM 
patients. In addition, the capacity to mediate daratumumab-induced ADCC against UM-9 target cells was 
significantly up-regulated in PBMC derived from three MM patients during lenalidomide treatment.  
In a second study, the potential benefit of combining daratumumab with multi-drug chemotherapy 
regimens was evaluated in fresh tumour cells from MM patients (Study GMB 3003-070). Lysis of primary 
tumour cells was measured directly in bone marrow mononuclear cell isolates obtained from MM patients. 
Addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib increased MM cell lysis by more than 
two-fold in all combinations (p < 0.001), even in samples from patients that were refractory to 
lenalidomide and  bortezomib treatment. Furthermore, combination of daratumumab with either 
lenalidomide/bortezomib/ dexamethasone cocktail or melphalan/ prednisone/ bortezomib cocktail 
resulted in  increased tumour cell lysis compared to cocktail alone.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical PK of daratumumab was evaluated in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicology study in 
chimpanzees administered weekly as an IV infusion, and followed by a 91 to 105-day recovery period. PK 
of HuMab-CD38 was evaluated in the repeat-dose pilot toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys via weekly IV infusion for 2-weeks, and followed by a 2-month recovery period.

Serum concentrations of daratumumab in chimpanzees and HuMab-CD38 in cynomolgus monkeys were 
determined using validated GLP-compliant ELISA bioanalytical methods. The lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) was determined to be 21.538 ng/mL in a 1% chimpanzee serum matrix and 22.973 ng/mL in a 
2.5% chimpanzee serum matrix. The LLOQ of the cynomolgus assay was determined to be 3.13 ng/mL in 
10% serum. 
Serum ADA of daratumumab in chimpanzees and HuMab-CD38 in cynomolgus monkeys were determined 
using validated GLP-compliant ELISA bioanalytical methods. Data obtained from the validation 
demonstrated that the ELISA-based methods for the detection of antibodies were suitable for use. 
However, a greater than 30% reduction in ADAs detection signal was observed for concentrations of 
daratumumab greater than 10 μg/mL in chimpanzee (Study BKV00005) 
6-week study in chimpanzees (Study 8754-0701, GLP) 
Two chimpanzees (1/sex) received 30 min. IV infusions of 5 mg/kg daratumumab. The male received 
weekly infusions for 6 consecutive weeks. The female was injured and only received 2 weekly infusions. 
An additional female died from an IRR shortly after the first infusion and was excluded from PK analysis. 
Two chimpanzees (1/sex) received IV infusions of 25 mg/kg daratumumab for 6 consecutive weeks. The 
first infusion of 25 mg/kg infusion was given over 1 h and was preceded by an IV injection of 10 mg 
daratumumab 24 h before the infusion. Subsequent 25 mg/kg infusions were given over 30 min without 
a pre-dose. Individual animal data are presented in Table 11. 
Table 3: Serum PK parameters in chimpanzees following weekly IV administration of 
Daratumumab  
No daratumumab anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected during the study.  
2-week study in Cynomolgus Monkeys (Study No. 509809, non-GLP) 
The study consisted of six male and six female cynomolgus monkeys randomized into 3 dose groups of 2 
cynomolgus monkeys/sex/group (ie, vehicle, 20, and 100 mg/kg daratumumab). Animals were dosed on 
Days 1 and 8, with animals assigned to the main study group (1/sex/group) euthanized 2 days after 
completion of the last dose (Day 11), and the remaining animals (1/sex/group) euthanized after a 
2-month (ie, 56 day) treatment-free period. Individual animal data are presented in Table 12.

Tissue Cross-Reactivity of FITC-Labeled Daratumumab With Chimpanzee Tissues Ex Vivo (Report 
BKV00003) 
This study was conducted to determine the tissue binding specificity of FITC-labeled daratumumab in 
normal chimpanzee tissue specimens. The following tissues were evaluated: adrenal gland, bone marrow, 
brain, colon, endothelium (heart), fallopian tube, GI tract (small intestine), heart, kidney (glomerulus and 
tubule), liver, lung (bronchiole and alveolus), lymph node (including mesenteric lymph node), pancreas, 
pituitary, skin, spinal cord, spleen, striated muscle, tonsil, and testes. 
FITC-labeled daratumumab was applied to cryosections of tissue samples. Binding was detected via a 
biotinylated goat anti-fluorescein secondary antibody. Bound complexes were visualized with a 
streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC) and a diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate.  
Specific daratumumab-FITC staining occurred in the lymphoid cells and macrophages, and in 
hematopoietic cells in the spleen, tonsil, lymph nodes, and lamina propria of the intestinal tract. Specific

binding was also detected in the cytoplasm of multiple chimpanzee tissues (adrenal gland, bone marrow, 
brain, colon, fallopian tube, GI tract, heart, kidney, liver, lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, pancreas, 
pituitary, skin, spinal cord, spleen, striated muscle, testes, and tonsil). The only tissue examined that 
showed no binding was lung. 
Daratumumab-FITC: An Immunohistochemical Investigation of Cross-Reactivity in a Range of Human 
Tissues (Report 28118) 
This study was conducted to determine the tissue binding specificity of FITC-labeled daratumumab on 
normal, adult human tissue specimens. The tissue panel was based on the “suggested list of human 
tissues to be used for immunohistochemical investigations of cross reactivity” in Annex II of the 1995 
European Medicines Evaluation Agency Guideline. All tissues selected for inclusion in this study were 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or giemsa (for blood and bone marrow) and an appropriate antigen 
marker before acceptance to the study. 
Sections of each sample of tissue were treated with FITC-labeled daratumumab at concentrations of 0, 
0.5, 1, and 2 µg/mL. Examination of the positive and negative controls showed the validity of the test 
system. Specific daratumumab-FITC staining occurred in the lymphoid cells in the spleen, tonsil, lymph 
nodes, and thymus. Specific daratumumab binding was also detected in the cytoplasm of multiple human 
tissues, ie, capillaries of the pituitary gland, vascular endothelial cells of the fallopian tube, lymphocytes 
in the ileum serosa, parathyroid, lymph node, spleen, thymus and tonsil, kidney, testis, and thyroid 
interstitial cells, epithelial cells of the fallopian tube, and the prostate. The subcellular location of staining 
in vascular endothelial cells of the pituitary gland and fallopian tube could not be determined. 
HuMab-CD38-FITC: An Immunohistochemical Investigation of Cross-Reactivity in a Range of Cynomolgus 
Monkey Tissues (Study 510547) 
This study was conducted to determine the tissue binding specificity of the FITC-conjugated 
HuMab-CD38, which binds to cynomolgus monkey CD38, in a panel of 35 normal cynomolgus monkey 
tissues: adrenal gland, brain (cerebellum and cerebrum), breast, eye (with retina), fallopian tube, GI 
tract (stomach, small intestine and large intestine), heart, kidney, liver,lung, lymph node, ovary, 
pancreas, peripheral nerve, pituitary gland, prostate, parotid salivary gland, skin, spinal cord, spleen, 
striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid and parathyroid gland, tonsil, urinary bladder, ureter, uterus 
(cervix and endometrium), and vascular endothelium. Haematological samples (blood and bone marrow) 
prepared as smears or cytospins were also evaluated.  
All tissues selected for inclusion in this study were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or giemsa (for 
blood and bone marrow) and an appropriate antigen marker before acceptance to the study. 
Acetone-fixed cryosections of each sample of tissue were treated with FITC-labeled HuMab-CD38 at 
concentrations of 0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 µg/mL. 
Staining was observed in the cytoplasm of blood vessels, bone marrow lymphocytes, cerebellum white 
matter, cerebrum white matter, cervix, colon lamina propria, fallopian tube interstitium, ileum lamina 
propria, lung alveolar cells, lymph node T-cells, peripheral nerve myelin, retina/choroidea glassy 
membrane, spinal cord white matter, spleen T-cell zone, stomach, striated muscle fibers, thymus T-cells 
in medulla and cortex, and tonsil T-cell zone. It was not possible to determine the subcellular location of 
specific staining in endothelial (capillary) cells, whose cytoplasm is particularly thin, or in the interstitium 
of glomeruli in the kidney or the sinusoids of the liver. In the kidney and liver, staining in the 
interstitium/sinusoids may reflect staining of endothelial cells.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has addressed the structural and functional properties of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 
in a comprehensive array of non-clinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies in support of the use of 
daratumumab in the proposed indication.  
Daratumumab binding to CD38 leads to multiple biologic effects on tumour cells. As an IgG1 antibody, 
daratumumab has the potential to bind to all FcγRs inducing ADCC, CDC and ADCP. These effector 
functions were assessed in cell-based studies, showing high tumour cell lysis, though with high variability. 
The mechanism underlying differences in cell lysis are unknown and could be attribute to effector cells 
(NK and macrophages) and/or to differences in CD38 expression.  
Binding of daratumumab to CD38 also mediated cell apoptosis and to modulate enzymatic activities of 
CD38, blunting cyclase activity and enhancing hydrolase activity, although the underlying cellular 
mechanism and the contribution to the overall anti-tumour effect are not clearly understood. 
Treatment with daratumumab effectively reduced growth of human lymphoma cells in SCID mice, both in 
the preventive and therapeutic settings. When administered to mice bearing established disease, 
therapeutic activity was observed at a dose as low as 10 μg per mouse, corresponding to approximately 
0.5 mg/kg body weight.  Pharmacological effects other than the primary therapeutic activity (secondary 
pharmacodynamics) could derive from IgG1 isotype effector functions such as cytokine release and 
complement-mediated lysis of erythrocytes. Daratumumab has a low level of binding to human 
erythrocytes but did not induce specific complement-mediated lysis of erythrocytes, however a risk of 
interference with blood typing may exist (see Clinical safety discussion and RMP). Cytokine release 
observed with daratumumab was similar to other marketed therapeutic antibodies and it was consistent 
with adverse effects observed in toxicology studies.  Overall, results of these studies support the 
hypothesis that daratumumab does not exert target-specific agonistic activity, and that the cytokine 
release observed is mainly caused by the Fc-portion of IgG1. 
Distinct differences in the binding of daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 to human and cynomolgus B and T 
lymphocytes were identified. Daratumumab did not demonstrate specific binding to any cynomolgus 
monkey cell types while both daratumumab and HuMab-CD38 bound weakly to human B and T cells. In 
contrast, HuMab-CD38 bound strongly to cynomolgus monkey B and T lymphocytes. HuMab-CD38 bound 
to cynomolgus monkey erythrocytes at concentrations > 3 µg/mL, which may suggest higher levels of 
CD38 expression in monkey vs. human peripheral blood cells. No binding to human erythrocytes was 
seen. The results support the use of HuMab-CD38 as a surrogate antibody for nonclinical studies involving 
cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys and indeed, the higher binding of HuMab-CD38 to cynomolgus monkey 
blood cells may suggest higher levels of CD38 expression in monkey vs. human peripheral blood cells, 
which could be an important consideration in interpreting results of nonclinical studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of daratumumab increased in a greater than dose-proportional 
manner with increasing dose. Daratumumab t1/2 values generally increased and CL values generally 
decreased after repeated administration and with increasing dose, which suggested saturation of 
elimination mechanisms at elevated serum drug concentrations.  
No consistent gender differences were observed for any of the PK parameters estimated in the 2-week 
study with HuMab-CD38 in cynomolgus monkeys. High drug substance concentrations are considered to

interfere with the detection of ADA’s and therefore, ADA presence cannot be completely excluded. 
Collectively, the non-clinical pharmacokinetic data of daratumumab derived from repeat dose toxicology 
studies is considered limited (as chimpanzees is the only relevant species), however, adequate for the 
characterization of the pharmacokinetics of daratumumab and the anti-CD38 mAb, HuMab-CD38 after 
single dose and repeated administration. 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were conducted with either daratumumab or HuMab-CD38. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the design of the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
as suggested in ICH S6(R1) and this approach is endorsed. There were no treatment-related adverse 
effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system parameters in the 6- and 2-week IV 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in chimpanzees and cynomolgus monkeys administered daratumumab or 
HuMab-CD38, respectively. 
The two primary toxicities in the pivotal chimpanzee study were infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and 
thrombocytopenia. Measures were taken to avoid the IRRs in the subsequent dosing of high-dose 
animals, i.e. a pre-dose of 10 mg daratumumab was administered i.v. 24 h before dosing, and infusion 
time was lengthened to 1 h, resulting in milder IRRs. In the clinical setting, IRRs are one of the safety 
issues, and measures are addressed accordingly in relevant sections of the SmPC (see discussion on 
clinical safety).  
At the histopathologic examination, thymic atrophy was observed in animals from the main study groups. 
Lymphoid atrophy or depletion was also observed in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and 
spleen in animals that received 20 or 100 mg/kg. Following the recovery period, there was minimal 
thymic atrophy in the 100 mg/kg-dosed female and minimal lymphoid depletion in the mesenteric lymph 
node in the 100 mg/kg-dosed male. A NOAEL was not established in this study.  
ADAs to HuMab-CD38 were detected in both monkeys in the 20 mg/kg recovery group. The development 
of ADA in non-clinical species is not necessarily predictive of potential immunogenicity in humans, 
however, positive Coombs’ tests have been observed in patients, and methods to ameliorate the 
interference of daratumumab in the assay have been developed and this has been addressed in the SmPC 
(see discussion on clinical safety). 
No developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed. Developmental and reproductive 
toxicity testing is not feasible in chimpanzees. The use of a surrogate antibody in cynomolgus monkeys 
was considered, but anaemia and formation of ADAs limit the dosages and duration of any additional 
studies in this species. In addition, as the majority of patient population is beyond reproductive age it is 
therefore acknowledged that such studies are not deemed necessary for marketing authorisation 
however in order to address the whole population studied, reproductive and developmental toxicity is 
included as missing information in the RMP (see discussion on clinical safety). The lack of such data is 
addressed in the SmPC as follows: ‘‘There are no human or animal data to assess the risk of 
daratumumab use during pregnancy. IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are known to cross the placenta after 
the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore daratumumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
benefit of treatment to the woman is considered to outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. If the patient 
becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the 
fetus’’ (see SmPC section 4.6). 
No genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are required for daratumumab.  
Local tolerance assessment was incorporated into repeat-dose studies with no relevant findings 
suggesting local toxicity. 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted using FITC-labeled daratumumab and normal chimpanzee 
and human tissue specimens. In addition, a tissue cross-reactivity study was conducted with FITC-labeled 
Assessment report

HuMab-CD38 and normal cynomolgus monkey tissue samples. Specific binding was observed in most 
lymphoid tissues which confirmed that HuMab-CD38 and daratumumab binds to target sites of the 
lymphoid tissues in all species. Furthermore, binding was observed in the cytoplasm in multiple tissues in 
all three species. However, cytoplasmic binding is generally not relevant for mAbs as they do not diffuse 
into cells and do not have access to the cytoplasm. 
The justification provided by the Applicant for not performing environmental risk assessment studies was 
considered acceptable since daratumumab is a protein therefore, unlikely to result in significant risk to 
the environment. This is in accordance with the “Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical pharmacology data for daratumumab and HuMab-CD38, is considered sufficient 
for the proposed cancer indication. The relevant information has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.6, 
5.1 and 5.3).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of daratumumab following intravenous administration were evaluated in 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma at dose levels from 0.1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg. A 
population PK model of daratumumab was developed to describe the PK characteristics of daratumumab 
and to evaluate the influence of covariates on the disposition of daratumumab in patients with multiple 
myeloma. The population PK analysis included 223 patients receiving daratumumab in two clinical trials 
(150 subjects received 16 mg/kg) (SmPC section 5.2). 
The exposure-response analyses were performed on the combined data from studies GEN501 (N=104) 
and MMY2002 (N=124) as well as the data from Study MMY1002.  
Absorption  
No bioavailability studies were performed. As daratumumab is administered intravenously, bioavailability 
is 100%.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vd) was investigated in the Phase I Study GEN501 (Part 1 and Part 2), in the 
Japanese Phase I Study MMY1002 and in the Phase II Study MMY2002.  
Assessment report

In GEN501 (Part 1), following the first IV administration of daratumumab, the mean Vz across dose levels 
(0.1-24 mg/kg) ranged from 38.24 to 58.94 mL/kg, and the mean values across the same dose range 
following the last infusion ranged from 31.90 to 104.77 mL/kg . In the larger sample of 42 subjects 
administered the recommended dose of 16 mg/kg (Study GEN501, Part 2), Vd was 90.19±43.40 mL/kg 
after the first dose and 59.51±54.68 mL/kg following the last dose. 
The values volumes observed in subjects receiving 8 mg/kg in Study MMY2002 were mean Vd: 
61.99±18.43 mL/kg), and in Japanese subjects participating in Study MMY1002: Mean Vd in subjects 
receiving 8 mg/kg was 66.94±30.89 mL/kg and mean Vd in subjects receiving 16 mg/kg  was 
57.97±3.29 mL/kg. 
The population PK estimate for the central volume of distribution is 56.98±18.07 mL/kg.  
Elimination 
As observed in the Phase I GEN501 study (Part 1), clearance decreased with multiple doses, particularly 
in the dose groups receiving at least 2 mg/kg daratumumab: In the 2 mg/kg group, mean clearance 
decreased from 1.06 mL/h/kg after the first full infusion to 0.59 mL/h/kg after the seventh (last) full 
infusion. In the 24 mg/kg group, mean clearance decreased from 0.29 mL/h/kg after the first full infusion 
to 0.16 mL/h/kg after the seventh (last) full infusion.  
The elimination halftime (T½) increased with multiple doses: from 25.62±5.61 hours for 2 mg/kg to 
154.65±36.48 hours for 24 mg/kg. In the 16 mg/kg group, mean T½ increased from 109.9±42.05 hours 
after the first full infusion to 586.56±486.89 hours after the seventh (last) full infusion (Study GEN501, 
Part 1).  
In the population PK analysis, the model-derived half-life (mean±standard deviation) associated with 
linear elimination was approximately 18±9 days.

Terminal half-life increases with increasing dose and with repeated dosing. The mean (standard deviation 
[SD]) estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the first 16 mg/kg dose was 9 (4.3) days. 
Based on population PK analysis, the mean (SD) half-life associated with non-specific linear elimination 
was approximately 18 (9) days (SmPC section 5.2). 
At the end of weekly dosing for the recommended schedule and dose of 16 mg/kg, the mean (SD) serum 
Cmax value was 915 (410.3) micrograms/mL, approximately 2.9-fold higher than following the first 
infusion. The mean (SD) predose (trough) serum concentration at the end of weekly dosing was 573 
(331.5) micrograms/mL (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the population PK analysis, daratumumab steady state is achieved approximately 5 months into 
the every 4-week dosing period (by the 21st infusion), and the mean (SD) ratio of Cmax at steady-state 
to Cmax after the first dose was 1.6 (0.5) (SmPC section 5.2).

Based on population PK analysis, age (range: 31-84 years) had no clinically important effect on the PK of 
daratumumab, and the exposure of daratumumab was similar between younger (aged < 65 years, n = 
127) and older (aged ≥  65 years, n = 96; aged ≥  75years, n = 18; aged ≥ 85 years, n = 0) patients. 
(SmPC section 5.2). 
Gender [female (n = 91), male (n = 132)] did not affect exposure of daratumumab to a clinically relevant 
degree (SmPC section 5.2). 
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. A population 
PK analysis was performed based on pre-existing renal function data in patients receiving daratumumab, 
including 71 with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CRCL] ≥  90 mL/min), 78 with mild renal 
impairment (CRCL < 90 and ≥  60 mL/min), 68 with moderate renal impairment (CRCL < 60 and ≥  30 
mL/min), and 6 with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (CRCL< 30 mL/min). No 
clinically important differences in exposure to daratumumab were observed between patients with renal 
impairment and those with normal renal function (SmPC section 5.2). 
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Changes in 
hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of daratumumab since IgG1 molecules 
such as daratumumab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways. A population PK analysis was 
performed to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment as defined using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction on the clearance of daratumumab based on pre existing hepatic 
function data in 223 patients. No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab were 
observed between patients with mild hepatic impairment (TB 1.0 x to 1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN; n = 34) 
and those with normal hepatic function (TB and AST ≤  ULN; n = 189). Daratumumab has not been 
studied in patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 x to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe (TB > 3 x ULN and any 
AST) hepatic impairment (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the population PK analysis the exposure to daratumumab was similar between white (n = 197) 
and non-white (n = 26) subjects (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on population PK analysis body weight was identified as a statistically significant covariate for 
daratumumab clearance. Therefore, body weight based dosing is an appropriate dosing strategy for the 
multiple myeloma patients (SmPC section 5.2).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein expressed 
at a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types and tissues at 
various levels. CD38 protein has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, signalling and 
enzymatic activity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In  Study  GEN501,  peripheral  blood  samples  were  immunophenotyped  to  track  specific  immune  cell 
subtypes (NK cells, T cells, and B cells), which may act as effector cells to induce tumour cell death with 
daratumumab. Decreases in NK cells were observed post-treatment in all treatment groups and were 
most pronounced in all treatment groups ≥2 mg/kg in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. In Part 2, 
the change in total NK cells (as a percentage of lymphocytes in bone marrow) decreased from a median 
of 14.50% at baseline to 2.80% on treatment in the 8 mg/kg group and from a median of 19.90% at 
baseline  to  5.90%  on  treatment  in  the  16  mg/kg  group;  these  changes  were  statistically  significant 
(p=0.0468 in 8 mg/kg group; p<0.0001 in the 16 mg/kg group).  
Baseline absolute counts of total NK cells and post-baseline changes in NK cells were compared between 
responders and non-responders for 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg groups in Study GEN501 Part 2. A decrease in 
total  NK  cells  was  observed  in  both  responders  and  non-responders  and  there  was  no  association 
observed  between  the  percentage  of  NK  cell  decrease  and  clinical  response  in  either  blood  or  bone 
marrow.   
In  addition  to  NK  cells,  other  lymphocytes  known  to  express  CD38  such  as  B  cells  and  T  cells  were 
measured at baseline and following daratumumab treatment. B cells (CD19+) were maintained in the 
peripheral  blood  and  bone  marrow  following  daratumumab  treatment.  T  cells,  both  CD3+CD4+  and 
CD3+CD8+, were noted to increase over time with daratumumab treatment both in the periphery and the 
bone marrow (absolute counts as well as percentage of lymphocytes). 
In  study  MMY2002,  total  NK  cells  (CD45+CD3-CD16+CD56+)  were  evaluated  as  a  possible 
pharmacodynamic biomarker for daratumumab. A decrease in absolute counts (cells/µL) of total NK cells 
in peripheral blood was observed following daratumumab treatment in both the 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg 
groups. In the 8 mg/kg group with monthly dosing of daratumumab, total NK cells were reduced by Cycle 
1 Day 2, but started to recover by Cycle 1 Day 4. Absolute counts of total NK cells increased until the next 
dose of daratumumab at Cycle 2, after which total NK cells decreased and did not recover during the 
treatment period. 
In the 16 mg/kg group (daratumumab dosing weekly for 8 weeks, every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, and every 
4 weeks thereafter), reduced absolute cell counts of total NK cells were observed by Cycle 1 Day 8 and 
remained at low levels during daratumumab treatment. In addition, activated NK cells (CD16+CD56dim) 
in blood also decreased following daratumumab dosing similar to total NK cells, and remained low while 
on treatment. The change in total NK cells (as a percentage of lymphocytes in bone marrow) decreased 
from a median of 14.80% at baseline to 8.00% on treatment in the 8 mg/kg group and from a median of

19.80%  at  baseline  to  4.60%  on  treatment  in  the  16  mg/kg  group;  these  changes  were  statistically 
significant (p=0.0039 in 8 mg/kg; p<0.0001 in 16 mg/kg group). 
Baseline absolute counts of total NK cells were also compared between responders and non-responders 
for the 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg groups. The baseline total NK cells counts in blood or bone marrow did not 
show any difference between responders and non-responders. There was also no association observed 
between the percentage of NK cell decrease and clinical response. 
Daratumumab treatment-associated changes were also observed in other immune cells. Evaluation of T 
cells indicated a significant increase of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells over time with daratumumab 
treatment  in  the  peripheral  blood  and  bone  marrow  (both  absolute  counts  and  percentage  of 
lymphocytes). 
Secondary pharmacology 
QTc interval 
The  effect  of  daratumumab  on  the  QTc  interval  was  evaluated  in  an  open-label  study  for  83  patients 
(Study GEN501) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma following daratumumab infusions (4 to 
24 mg/kg) (SmPC section 5.1). 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  analyses  was  performed  using  a  linear  mixed  effects  modeling 
approach to examine the relationship between the baseline-adjusted/corrected change in QTcF intervals 
and time-matched (within 3 hours) serum concentrations of daratumumab.  
In GEN501 Part 1, no statistically significant or clinically relevant change in QTcF vs. daratumumab serum 
concentrations was observed (Table 18). 
Table 10: Change from Baseline Versus the Daratumumab Serum Concentration - Estimates 
From  Linear  Mixed  Model  [1,2]  QTc  Fridericia  Interval  (msec)  (Part  1,  Pharmacokinetic- 
Pharmacodynamic Population) 
A separate analysis was performed for 72 subjects (8 mg/kg n=30; 16 mg/kg n=42) in Study GEN501 
Part 2. Pharmacokinetic- and pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using a linear mixed effects 
modeling approach to examine the relationship between the baseline-adjusted/corrected change in QTcF 
intervals and time-matched (within 3 hours) serum concentrations of daratumumab. The primary QT 
correction method was the Fridericia corrected QT (QTcF) because the Bazett correction is often less 
reliable. A statistically significant and borderline clinically relevant change in QTcF vs. daratumumab 
serum concentrations was observed with a ΔQTc of 12.34 msec at average daratumumab Cmax of 700 
µg/mL (p<0.0001) (Table 19). No QTcF increase >60 ms, no new QTcF >500 ms, and no new abnormal 
U waves were observed.

Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of daratumumab has been evaluated in 2 monotherapy daratumumab studies 
(GEN501 and MMY2002) using validated ECLIA methods. 
Patients (n = 199) were evaluated for anti-therapeutic antibody responses to daratumumab at multiple 
time points during treatment and up to 8 weeks following the end of treatment. Following the start of 
daratumumab treatment, none of the patients tested positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies (SmPC 
section 5.1). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The exposure-response analyses were performed on the combined data from studies GEN501 (N=104) 
and MMY2002 (N=124) as well as the data from study MMY2002 alone. Different exposure metrics were 
predicted and derived using estimated individual PK parameters based on the population PK model and 
actual dosing information for each subject. The exposure metrics included (1) maximal pre-infusion 
(trough) concentration (Cpre-infusion,max), (2) maximal end-of-infusion concentration 
(Cpost-infusion,max), (3) pre-infusion concentration before the last dose received, (4) end-of-infusion 
concentration after the last dose received, and (5) average concentration during the treatment. For the 5 
subjects without measurable concentrations and excluded from the population PK analyses, the 
exposures (ie, concentrations) were set to half of the lower limit of the quantification (ie, 0.1 μg/mL).   
The exposure-efficacy analyses were performed for ORR, the primary efficacy endpoint in study 
MMY2002, and other secondary endpoints (DOR, TTP, TTR, OS, PFS, and maximal reduction in 
paraprotein [MRPP]). For study GEN501, the response and progression data were based on a 
computerised algorithm since IRC data were not available from the study. The clinical relevance of 
significant covariates identified from the population PK analyses (ie, body weight, albumin, gender, drug 
product, and type of myeloma) was evaluated using ORR in the exposure-efficacy analyses. 
Overall response rate significantly increased with daratumumab systemic exposure, and there was a 
maximum effect (Emax) relationship between daratumumab exposure and ORR . Among the tested 
exposure metrics, Cpre-infusion,max had the strongest correlation with ORR as it best described the data 
and provided the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The estimated half maximal effect 
Cpre-infusion,max 
 was 261 μg/mL, and the slope factor was approximately 45. Therefore, the 90% 
maximal effect on ORR may be achieved when Cpre-infusion,max = 274 μg/mL (
), and limited 
additional benefit in ORR could be obtained when Cpre-infusion,max was above the predicted 
. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on (1) subjects who completed at least 8 doses in the pooled

GEN501/MMY2002 dataset, (2) data from Study MMY2002 alone, and (3) subjects who completed at least 
8 doses in Study MMY2002 alone. Both predicted and observed concentration data showed that 
approximately 80% of the subjects who were in the 16 mg/kg dose group and completed at least 8 
infusions had Cpre-infusion,max above the estimated 
. 
The figure below shows an apparent separation in the observed trough concentration over time between 
responders and non-responders, and maximum separation was observed around the maximal trough 
concentrations for both groups. The mean maximum trough concentration in non-responders appears 
below the 
, while it is well above the threshold in responders. 
Figure 2: Comparison of Observed Pre-infusion (Trough) Concentration Over Time Between 
Responders and Non-responders  
Comparison of Daratumumab 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg 
Simulations were conducted to compare the trough concentrations for 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg dose levels 
under the recommended dosing schedule (ie, QW for 8 weeks, Q2W for 16 weeks, and then Q4W [8 doses 
for the current simulation] thereafter). Individual post hoc PK parameters based on the final population 
PK model for the 223 subjects from Studies GEN501 and MMY2002 were used. 
The percentage of subjects that would achieve 90% and 99% target saturation at the end of the QW and 
Q4W dosing period was calculated. The simulations showed that the majority of subjects (ie, >80%) may 
achieve the 99% predicted target saturations after weekly dosing, and 90% predicted target saturations 
after Q4W (ie, at steady state) dosing at 16 mg/kg. However, in comparison, only approximately 50% of 
subjects may achieve 99% predicted target saturation after the QW dosing of 8 mg/kg daratumumab, 
and approximately 70% of subjects may achieve 90% target saturation at 8 mg/kg daratumumab after 
the Q4W dosing (Figure 8). 
Conclusively, the response rates were consistently and significantly higher and deeper at the 16 mg/kg 
dose level as compared to various schedules at the 8 mg/kg dose level.

In Study GEN501, assessment of NK cells in peripheral blood was performed for the following dosing 
groups: ≤1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, 16 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg. Decreases in NK cells were 
observed post-treatment in all treatment groups and were most pronounced in treatment groups ≥2 
mg/kg in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. 
Dosing regimen 
The total clearance of daratumumab decreased over time, possibly due to the depletion of the target 
(CD38). The intensive weekly dosing at the beginning of the treatment was therefore helpful to overcome 
the high clearance initially, and rapidly establish the efficacious concentration. Thereafter, the every 2 
week and every 4 week dosing at 16 mg/kg appeared to be adequate to saturate the target and maintain 
the total clearance close to the non-specific linear clearance. The reduction in daratumumab 
concentration over time during less frequent dosing was not associated with either shorter duration of 
response or higher risk of disease progression. This result corroborates the finding based on the clinical 
analysis in which the rate of subjects who had disease progression was consistent in every 2 week and 
every 4 week dosing periods. 
Exposure-safety 
Exposure-safety analyses were conducted for selected AEs, including infusion-related reactions (IRRs), 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and infections. Both treatment-emergent and 
drug-related adverse events (AEs) were investigated. The predicted end-of-infusion concentration after 
the first infusion (ie, Cmax after first dose, Cmax,1st) was explored for IRRs because the majority of IRRs 
occurred after the first dose, while the predicted maximal end-of-infusion concentration (ie, multiple-dose 
Cmax, Cpost-infusion,max) was investigated for the other AEs. Safety data were based on either the data 
from Study GEN501 and Study MMY2002 combined (n=228) or Study MMY2002 alone (n=124). No 
apparent relationship between the drug exposure and IRR, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, 
and lymphopenia was identified. Although the overall event rate of infection appeared to numerically 
increase with drug exposure, this trend was not observed for infections Grade 3 or higher. Further 
analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the rate of infections/infestations between IgG 
and non-IgG multiple myeloma subjects, although higher exposure was observed in non-IgG multiple 
myeloma subjects.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
There is no information available regarding pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products 
or substances. A decrease in total NK cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates was observed 
following daratumumab treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone in all cohorts (Phase 1 and Phase 2 
of Study GEN503). The NK cell decrease observed in this combination study was comparable to that 
observed with daratumumab monotherapy treatment in earlier studies (Studies MMY2002 and GEN501). 
In vitro studies have shown that glucocorticoid inhibits CD38 expression in human airway smooth muscle 
(HASM) cells (Kang BN et al. The FASEB Journ, 2006 May, vol 20: 1000-2 [E170-8], Tirumurugaan KG et 
al. Resp Research 2008,9:26-40). No significant difference in median steroid dose between responders 
and non-responders though no statistical analyses have been observed. 
In vitro studies have also shown that novobiocin increases CD38 expression (Thiele A et al. Biochimica 
Biophysica Acta, 2002:32-40). An analysis of baseline CD38 expression between responders and 
non-responders in studies GEN501 and MMY2002 shown that the baseline median expression levels of 
CD38 in bone marrow multiple myeloma cells (CD138+) were lower in non-responders compared to 
responders, but a substantial overlap of the CD38 level between the two response groups were observed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of daratumumab has been reasonably well investigated and generally in accordance with the 
current guideline on the clinical investigation of pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins 
(CHMP/EWP/89249/2004) and scientific advice provided by EMA/CHMP/SAWP 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/69790/2013). The overall approach of combined phase I/II trials and additional 
population PK- and exposure–response analyses can be supported. Of note, all pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic investigations were performed on target population namely patients with multiple 
myeloma relapsed from or refractory to 2 or more different prior therapies and therefore no extrapolation 
from e.g. healthy volunteers is necessary.  
The primary PK of daratumumab is well characterised and is in accordance with the expected for an 
immunoglobulin (IgG). PK data demonstrated a model-derived mean half-life of approximately 18±9 
days, which is approximate to the half-life of endogenous IgG (reported to be approximately 21 days 
[Keizer et al. 2010]). The model-derived mean half-life is based on data included in the population PK 
analyses and thus is expected to be for the doses of the pooled dataset however, data for patients treated 
with the recommended dose of 16 mg/kg and in steady state (i.e. after the last full infusion) is limited to 
less than 10 patients and therefore, the model-derived mean half-life is based on the population PK 
analyses is considered to be most representative.   
Inter-individual variability has not been specifically addressed but generally, the inter-individual 
variability in PK parameters was moderate to high (25-50%). As expected also the intra-individual 
variability was moderate (32.7%).  
The PPK analysis was overall performed using well recognised model building techniques.  
Limited data were available for the following categories of the covariates, limiting the possibility for a 
robust assessment of the PK in these patients: age (≥ 75 years: n=18); races (White, Hispanic or Latino: 
3% n=7; Asian: 2% n=4; other: 2% n=5); creatinine clearance category (≥15-≤29 ml/min: 2%, n=5; 
<15 ml/min: 0%, n=1); hepatic dysfunction (mild dysfunction: 15% n=34); baseline ECOG score (2: 6%, 
n=14); refractory status (None: 10%, n=23; PI only: 4%, n=8; IMiD only: 6%, n=14). The CHMP 
recommended the Applicant to perform additional analyses of the age, gender, renal impairment, hepatic 
impairment, ECOG score and refractory status with larger sample sizes as current Phase 3 studies reach 
maturation. 
With reference to hepatic impairment, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have a direct effect on 
the elimination of daratumumab since IgG1 molecules are not metabolised through hepatic pathways. 
Nevertheless, relevance of mild hepatic impairment on PK exposure cannot be completely ruled out since 
number of patients with mild hepatic impairment patients are limited (n=34) although the 95%CIs 
(normal and mild) are overlapped. Additionally, the low limit of the 95%CI of mild hepatic impairment 
(235.77 μg/mL) is under 274 μg/mL (EC90 ORR) which may have impact on efficacy. It is reassuring that 
mild hepatic impairment was not a significant covariate based on the model-based covariate analyses. 
Moreover, an analysis of the response-rate between patients with normal and mild hepatic function 
revealed no clinically relevant difference: The overall response rate (ORR) for patients treated with 16 
mg/kg and with mild hepatic impairment (n=24) was 33% (95%CI: 16.9%-53.2%) compared with 31% 
(95%CI: 23.1%-39.1%) in the patients treated with at 16 mg/kg and with normal hepatic function 
(n=127). Hepatic impairment may also have impact on levels of albumin or indirect pathway of 
elimination of daratumumab. This was evaluated by studying albumin’s (<35 g/L vs. ≥ 35 g/L) effect on 
overall response rate (ORR) before and after adjusting for drug exposure. The effect of albumin (<35 g/L 
vs. ≥ 35 g/L) on ORR before and after adjusting for daratumumab exposure is similar and these results 
are in line with the results of the analysis performed with albumin as a continuous variable supporting that 
albumin does not affect the effect of daratumumab. The CHMP recommended that the impact of baseline 
Assessment report

hepatic impairment on safety and efficacy of daratumumab should be further characterized through the 
collection and analysis of additional PK data from the ongoing clinical studies. 
NK cells are known to express high levels of CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell 
lysis. Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated 
(CD16+CD56dim) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with daratumumab 
treatment. However, baseline levels of NK cells or kinetics of NK cell decrease did not show an association 
with clinical response (SmPC section 5.1). 
T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) are also known to express CD38 depending on the stage of development 
and the level of activation. Significant increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts, and 
percentages of lymphocytes, were observed with daratumumab treatment in peripheral whole blood and 
bone marrow. In addition, T-cell receptor DNA sequencing verified that T-cell clonality was increased with 
daratumumab treatment, indicating immune modulatory effects that may contribute to clinical response 
(SmPC section 5.1). 
The immunogenicity of daratumumab has been evaluated in 2 monotherapy daratumumab studies 
(GEN501 and MMY2002) using validated Charles River ECLIA methods. Limitations in detecting 
anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of daratumumab cannot be ruled 
out. Therefore, the Applicant should develop a new method for detecting ADAs. Immunogenicity has been 
classified as an important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) however until further 
information are available, the following text is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC: ‘‘Patients (n = 199) 
were evaluated for anti therapeutic antibody responses to daratumumab at multiple time points during 
treatment and up to 8 weeks following the end of treatment. Following the start of daratumumab 
treatment, none of the patients tested positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies. However, the employed 
assay has limitations in detecting anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of 
daratumumab. Therefore, the incidence of antibody development might not have been reliably 
determined”. 
The optimised method JRD, which was used in studies MMY2002, had a sufficient drug tolerance up to 
31,250 ng/mL (without dilution 625 µg/mL). According to protocol, immunogenicity was tested on C1D1 
pre, C3D1 pre, C6D1 pre, C12D1 pre and after the end of treatment. It should be noted that the mean ± 
SD through concentration at the end of weekly dosing (Cycle 3 Day 1 predose) was 573.49±331.49 
µg/mL. Consequently, the presence of anti-daratumumab antibodies in studies MMY2002 may have been 
underestimated because observed concentration could be higher than drug tolerance at some time 
points. 
Exposure-response analyses have demonstrated that the response rate significantly increased with 
daratumumab systemic exposure. The choice of 16 mg/kg rather than 8 mg/kg has been sufficiently 
justified as the recommended dose however, considered the seriousness of the disease and the poor 
prognosis for this group of patients, it was questioned if additional treatment response can be obtained by 
increasing the percentage of patients reaching a Cpre-infusion,max above the estimated. However a dose 
of 24 mg/kg compared with the recommended dose of 16 mg/kg, will only result in approximately 10% 
more subjects with a a Cpre-infusion,max above the estimated. It is acknowledged that most of the 
patients (i.e. the approximately 80% with a 99% predicted target saturation after weekly dosing) will not 
benefit from a higher dose but considering the seriousness of the disease and the dismissing prognosis for 
the patients not responding to daratumumab treatment, an increase of 10% patients with a clinically 
relevant increase in effect appears compelling. In addition, the experience with 24 mg/kg is indeed very 
limited (3 patients) thus naturally insufficient for a benefit-risk assessment. Therefore, 24 mg/kg is not a 
realistic alternative to 16 mg/kg, which remains the recommended dose.

The results from the analyses of ORR in the IgG and the ORR in the non-IgG groups are almost similar 
supporting the fact that the decreased estimated   in patients with IgG multiple myeloma is 
counter-balanced by an increased sensitivity. Thus, the difference in drug exposure in the IgG and the 
non-IgG groups seems not to be clinically relevant and despite the fact that an increase in treatment dose 
can be expected to increase efficacy (including ORR, PFS and DoR), this is expected to be of similar 
magnitude for both  IgG and non-IgG patients. Therefore, there is no apparent reason for different dosing 
regimen depending on IgG-status.  
No interaction studies have been performed. As an IgG1қ monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and 
hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact daratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination 
routes. As such, variations in drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of 
daratumumab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to 
alter drug-metabolising enzymes (SmPC section 5.1).  
Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays 
used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). This can lead to false positive SPE 
and IFE assay results for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial assessment of 
complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In patients with persistent 
very good partial response, other methods to evaluate the depth of response should be considered (SmPC 
section 4.5). 
In agreement with the EMA/CHMP/SAWP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/69790/2013), no thorough 
QT study was conducted. It is unlikely that daratumumab inhibits the hERG channel or causes a (clinically 
relevant) prolongation of the QTc. Nevertheless, conflicting results were observed in Study GEN501 Part 
1 and Part 2. Part 1 investigates QTc changes over a wider range of daratumumab exposure but results 
from the PK-PD studies showed that most patients have serum daratumumab concentrations around 
101-103 µg/mL and therefore, results from the Part 2 are considered representative for the majority of 
patients treated with the recommended dosage.  An analysis of daratumumab concentration and QTc 
prolongation did not find a linear association. Likewise, subgroup analyses of patients concomitantly 
treated with known QTc prolonging medication and subgroups by age, gender, electrolyte abnormalities, 
and CHF did not find an association between any of these subgroups and QTc prolongation either. Thus, 
taken together, no plausible cause for the findings of the statistically significant QTc prolongation in Study 
GEN501 Part 2 has been identified.  
Linear mixed PK-PD analyses indicated no large increase in mean QTcF interval (i.e., greater than 20ms) 
at daratumumab Cmax (SmPC section 5.1). 
A thorough QTc study is not feasible but the Applicant will incorporate well-controlled data collection in a 
substudy of the ongoing Study SMM2001 to further evaluate a relationship between datatumumab 
concentration and QTc. QTc prolongation has been classified as an important potential risk in the RMP 
(See Clinical Safety discussion and RMP).   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of daratumumab has been reasonably well investigated and generally 
in accordance with the current guideline (CHMP/EWP/89249/2004).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study GEN501 
Study GEN501 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, non-randomized, first-in-human study in subjects with 
multiple myeloma whose disease was relapsed or refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapies. 
In Part 1 of Study GEN501 (the First-in-Human dose escalation study), escalating doses of daratumumab 
were administered (0.005, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg) as a single dose, followed by 
a 3 week resting period, followed by 6 weekly doses for a total of 7 doses. The subjects in the 4 mg/kg, 
8 mg/kg, 16 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg were included in the Part 1 efficacy analysis (n=3 subjects at each dose 
level). The best response at any dose level in this 8 week treatment period of Part 1 was a partial 
rtesponse (PR). A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. An IDMC determined that, based on 
data from Part 1, the study could move forward with daratumumab doses ≥ 8 mg/kg. Based on the PK and 
efficacy data in Part 1, the 8 mg/kg dose was chosen as the Part 2 dose. However, during Part 2, it was 
identified that the 8 mg/kg dose may not saturate a majority of the target (CD38) throughout dosing, as 
indicated by the high inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetics. Therefore, the 8 mg/kg dose in Part 2 
was changed to 16 mg/kg (Protocol Amendment 13) to assess whether high-dose intensity (leading to 
higher levels of systemic exposure and consistent saturation of the CD38 target), was needed to optimize 
the efficacy of daratumumab. 
In Part 2 of Study GEN501, daratumumab 16 mg/kg was administered as a single dose, followed by a 3 
week resting period, followed by weekly doses for 7 weeks, then every other week for an additional 14 
weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for up to 96 weeks. In Part 2, the 16 mg/kg dose level (n=42, ORR 
of 36%) had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in higher and deeper response rates as compared 
to the 8 mg/kg dose level (n=30, ORR of 10%).

Study MMY2002 was an open-label, 2-part, multicentre, Phase 2 study in subjects with multiple myeloma 
who received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease was double 
refractory to both a PI and an IMiD. The purpose of Part 1 was to select the optimal dose and schedule 
with a higher overall response rate (ORR) using Phase 1/2 pre-change drug product. Within each 
randomized treatment group in Part 1, a 2-stage design was utilized to allow an inefficacious dose 
schedule to be terminated early for futility. The purpose of Part 2 was to evaluate the efficacy of the 
selected dosing regimen identified in Part 1 in a population using Phase 3 (large scale production) drug 
product. 
Part 1 of Study MMY2002 began at approximately the same time as the implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 13 in Study GEN501 (i.e., amendment to allow for administration of 16 mg/kg in Part 2). In 
Part 1 of Study MMY2002, 2 dosing regimens were evaluated in a randomized fashion (8 mg/kg every 4 
weeks and 16 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks, then every other week for 16 weeks, then every 4 weeks 
thereafter). It was expected that the 16 mg/kg dose would result in complete saturation of the target for 
all time points in the majority of subjects. The ORR for subjects treated with 8 mg/kg (n=18) in Part 1 was 
11% as compared to 32% for subjects in Part 1 treated with 16 mg/kg (n=41). Furthermore, the VGPR or 
better rate for the 16 mg/kg group in Part 1 was 20% (8 of 41 subjects) as compared to 6% (1 of 18 
subjects) at the 8 mg/kg dose level. The observed ORR at the 8 mg/kg dose level did not meet the 
protocol-specified criteria for continuation. Based on the totality of the data including efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics, the 8 mg/kg dose schedule was discontinued.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
MMY2002 
Study MMY2002 was an open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 
daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy 
(including a proteasome inhibitor and IMiD) or are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an 
IMiD. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients ≥ 18 years of age with documented multiple myeloma, were eligible to enter the study.  
The key inclusion criteria were the following: 
•  Documented  multiple  myeloma  as  defined  by  the  criteria  below  and  evidence  of  disease 
progression on the most recent prior treatment regimen based on IMWG criteria: 
- 
- 
Prior documentation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ≥ 10% or presence of a 
biopsy-proven plasmacytoma. 
Presence  of  measurable  disease  at  baseline  as  defined  by  any  of  the  following:  serum 
M-protein  level  ≥ 1.0  g/dL  or  urine  M-protein  level  ≥ 200  mg/24  hours;  or  IgA  multiple 
myeloma: Serum M-protein level ≥ 0.5 g/dL or urine M-protein level 200 mg/24 hours; or 
light chain multiple myeloma: Serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) 10 mg/dL and 
abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda FLC ratio. 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 44/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Evidence of response (ie, achieved ≥ 25% reduction in M-protein for ≥ 6 weeks [MR]) to at least 
1 of their prior treatment regimens. 
•  Received an alkylating agent (≥ 2 cycles or 2 months) either alone or in combination with other 
myeloma  treatments.  One  course  of  an  alkylating  agent  for  autologous  stem  cell 
transplantation (ASCT) alone or in combination was acceptable. A list of alkylating agents is 
provided in the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) Guidelines (NCCN 2013). 
•  Received at least 3 prior lines of therapy (definition below) including a PI (≥ 2 cycles or 2 months 
of treatment) and an IMiD (≥ 2 cycles or 2 months of treatment) in any order during the course 
of treatment (except for patients who discontinued either of these treatments due to a severe 
allergic reaction within the first 2 cycles/months). 
OR 
Disease was double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. For patients who received more than 1 type of 
PI or IMID, their disease was to be refractory to the most recent one of them.  
•  ECOG performance status score of 0, 1, or 2. 
The key exclusion criteria were the following: 
•  Previously received daratumumab or other anti-CD38 therapies. 
•  Received anti-myeloma treatment within 2 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1. 
•  Nonsecretory  multiple  myeloma  based  upon  standard  M-component  criteria  (ie,  measurable 
serum/urine M-component) unless the baseline serum FLC level was elevated. 
•  Previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant or ASCT within 12 weeks before Cycle 1, 
Day 1. 
•  Received  a  cumulative  dose  of  corticosteroids  more  than  the  equivalent  of  ≥ 140  mg  of 
prednisone within the 2–week period before Cycle 1, Day 1. 
•  History  of  malignancy  (other  than  multiple  myeloma)  within  5  years  before  Cycle  1,  Day  1 
(exceptions were squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the 
cervix,  or  malignancy  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  with  concurrence  with  the 
sponsor's medical monitor, was considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence). 
•  Exhibited clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma. 
Treatments 
Daratumumab was administered as an IV infusion in 28-day cycles until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons as listed in the CSR.  
In Part 1, patients received 1 of the following 2 treatment regimens: 
•  Group A: daratumumab 16 mg/kg: Cycles 1 and 2: Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (weekly), Cycle 3 to 6: 
Days 1 and 15 (every other week), and Cycles 7+: Day 1 (every 4 weeks) 
•  Group B: daratumumab 8 mg/kg: Cycle 1+: Day 1 (every 4 weeks) 
As of Amendment 2, subjects in Group B were given the option to cross over to Group A. Patients who 
crossed over to Group A could begin receiving daratumumab at 16 mg/kg after consultation between the 
investigator and the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
Patients enrolled in Part 2 of the study received a dose of 16 mg/kg. 
A schematic of the study design is provided in the figure below:

Figure 3: Design of Study MMY2002 
All subjects received pre-infusion medication as shown in the following table: 
Table 15: Pre-infusion medication (Study MMY2002) 
For the prevention of delayed IRRs, all subjects were to receive corticosteroid orally (20 mg 
methylprednisolone or equivalent in accordance with local standards) on the 2 days following all 
daratumumab infusions (beginning the day after the infusion). For subjects with a higher risk of 
respiratory complications (eg, subjects who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % from 
predicted <75%), the following post-infusion medications should have been considered: 
•  Antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent) on the first and second days after all 
infusions 
•  Short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol 
•  Control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled corticosteroids ± long-acting β2 adrenergic 
receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long-acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium 
or salmeterol ±inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease) 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 treatment regimens of daratumumab, as 
measured by the ORR (PR or better) in patients with MM who had received at least 3 prior lines of therapy 
including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease was double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD agent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 46/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of daratumumab. 
To assess the pharmacokinetics of Phase 2 drug product and Phase 3 drug product. 
To evaluate duration of and time to response to daratumumab. 
To determine the clinical benefit (minimal response [MR] or better) rate following treatment with 
daratumumab. 
To evaluate clinical outcomes including time to disease progression (TTP), progression-free 
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
To assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and generation of antibodies to 
daratumumab (immunogenicity). 
To explore biomarkers predictive of response to daratumumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR), which was defined as the proportion of 
subjects who achieved PR or better according to the IMWG criteria (Durie 2007, Rajkumar 2011). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Duration of response, defined as the time from the date of initial response (PR or better) to the 
date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, according to IMWG criteria. 
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date 
of death from any cause. 
•  Clinical benefit rate (MR or better), defined as the proportion of subjects with best response of MR 
or better (including PR, very good partial response (VGPR), CR, and sCR). 
• 
• 
• 
Time to response, defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date of 
initial documentation of a response (PR or better). 
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time between the date of first dose of 
daratumumab and either disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. 
Time to disease progression (TTP), defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of 
daratumumab to the date of first record of disease progression. 
Disease evaluations were to be performed by a central laboratory (unless otherwise specified) according 
to the Time and Events Schedule in the protocol until disease progression. The study used the IMWG 
consensus recommendation for multiple myeloma treatment response criteria (Durie 2007, Rajkumar 
2011)4,13 presented in Table 24.

Sample size 
Up to 90 subjects were to be enrolled in Part 1, in which Phase 2 drug product was to be used. This part 
utilized a Simon’s randomized 2-stage Phase 2 design to identify the treatment group for Part 2, in which 
Phase 3 drug product was used. Within each randomized treatment group, a 2-stage design was 
employed. The null hypothesis was that the ORR was at most 15%, and the alternative hypothesis was 
that the ORR was at least 40%. With a one-sided α of 2.5%, and a power of 85%, the total sample size 
within each randomized treatment group in Part 1 was 36 response-evaluable subjects. Assuming a 
non-evaluable rate of 10%, up to 40 subjects were to be enrolled within each randomized treatment 
group. The Stage 1 analysis was to be performed when approximately 15 subjects were enrolled in each 
treatment group and had sufficient data (i.e. up to 8 weeks of treatment) to be evaluable for response. 
Future enrolment into each treatment group was to be terminated if it was determined during the first 
stage that the treatment group was considered as ineffective or not well-tolerated. If a treatment group 
proceeded to the second stage with a total of 36 evaluable subjects with 2 stages combined, the null 
hypothesis was to be rejected if 11 or more responses were observed. 
If it was determined at the end of Part 1 that a treatment group was to be further evaluated in Part 2, then 
up to an additional 60 subjects were to be enrolled in Part 2 and treated with Phase 3 drug product. This 
would bring the total number of subjects treated during the study up to approximately 100 for the 
selected treatment group. The purpose of Part 2 was to characterize the 2 different drug products with 
respect to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety. 
Randomisation 
Central randomization was implemented in Part 1 Stage 1 using an interactive web response system 
(IWRS).  
Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (daratumumab dosed at 8 mg/kg or 16 
mg/kg).  The randomization was stratified by International Staging System (I, II, or III) and refractory 
status (none, refractory to either a PI or IMiD, or refractory to both a PI and IMiD).

This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
Subject Populations Analyzed 
All treated Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of daratumumab were used for all 
efficacy and safety analyses. 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set: The per-protocol analysis set excluded all treated subjects who have had major 
protocol deviations due to not meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: All treated subjects with at least 1 post-infusion sample were used for all 
pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Immunogenicity Analysis Set: All treated subjects with appropriate samples for detection of antibodies to 
daratumumab. 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. For each observed response category, a 2-sided 
95% exact confidence interval (CI) was presented. For the calculation of ORR, those patients who were 
not evaluable for response, were to be considered non-responders.  
No statistical comparison was performed. The Kaplan-Meier curve was provided for subjects in the 16 
mg/kg group only and by responder vs. non-responder based on computerized IMWG algorithm. 
As an exploratory analysis, the same PFS analyses were repeated based on investigator assessment, 
where progressive disease was determined by study investigators. 
Additionally, in Part 2, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) were 
provided to summarize time to first response and time to best response for responders in each treatment 
group. A waterfall plot was generated for maximum percent reduction from baseline in serum/urine 
M-protein or FLC, based on the measurable type at baseline. Among responders, a shift table of bone 
marrow percent plasma cells from baseline value to first value post-baseline was provided and a figure 
was generated to display the percent change from baseline. No inferential analysis was performed.  
The primary analysis sets for efficacy results were all treated patients.  Two interim analyses were 
performed as specified in the protocol.  
The first interim analysis also referred to as a futility analysis, occurred in March 2014, with a data cut-off 
8 weeks after the last patient in Part 1 Stage 1 was dosed. Thirty-four (34) patients who were treated in 
Part 1 Stage 1 (18 from the 8 mg/kg group and 16 from the 16 mg/kg group), were included in the first 
interim analysis.  
The second interim analysis had a data cut-off 8 weeks after the last patient in Part 1 Stage 2 was dosed, 
and occurred in June and July 2014. An additional 25 patients were treated in the 16 mg/kg group in Part 
1 Stage 2. Based on the cumulative response data observed in Part 1, 11 patients (27%) achieved 
response in the 16 mg/kg group and this group was further expanded in Part 2. 
Three subjects crossed over during the study from the 8 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg but were included in the 8 
mg/kg group in all analyses, unless otherwise specified.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 26 sites in 3 countries (Canada, Spain, and the United States). Most of the 
subjects (72%) were enrolled at sites in the United States (16 sites), 18% in Canada (6 sites), and 10% 
in Spain (4 sites). 
The first subject started treatment on 08 October 2013, and the last subject started treatment on 20 May 
2014. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 11 July 2013, was amended 3 times. The original platelet count criteria was 
<75 x109/L for subjects in whom <50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; otherwise 
platelet count <50 x109/L.  
•  Amendment INT-1 (26 November 2013): included the following changes: the sample size was 
increased to approximately 20 subjects per treatment group in Part 1 Stage 1 from an original 15 
subjects, the study agent administration guidelines were changed from mg/hr to mL/hr, and 
Assessment report

minor additional changes were made for clarification throughout the protocol. An alternative 
treatment group (Group C; at the discretion of the Sponsor) was permitted to be added in Part 1, 
Stage 2, if either or both of the existing Treatment Groups A or B were considered as ineffective 
and/or not well tolerated. The platelet count criteria was revised to <75 x109/L for subjects in 
whom >50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; otherwise platelet count <50 
x109/L in subjects with bone marrow plasma cells ≤ 50%. 
•  Amendment INT-2 (07 February 2014): included the following changes: following the 
discontinuation of the dose schedule of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks (Treatment Group B) at the end 
of Stage 1, the number of subjects in Part 2 was increased to approximately 60 subjects, 
biomarker sampling time points were modified, and subjects in Group B were allowed to 
crossover to Group A. The platelet count criteria was modified to <50 x109/L (transfusion support 
within 7 days before the laboratory test is not permitted). 
•  Amendment INT-3 (09 July 2014): changed the timing of the on treatment bone marrow biopsy.

GEN 501 
Study GEN501 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicentre, safety study divided into 2 parts. Part 1 was a 
dose-escalation phase; Part 2 was a single-arm phase with multiple cohorts, based on the dose levels 
established in Part 1. Part 2 was one of the main studies described below. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The key inclusion criteria were the following: 
1.  Documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma requiring systemic therapy. Diagnosis of myeloma 
must have been made following the established criteria at the time of diagnosis (Durie 2006): 
• 
• 
• 
Presence of a measurable M-protein in serum and/or urine. Measurable M-protein was 
defined as:  
-  Serum M-protein level ≥1.0 g/dL or urine M-protein level ≥200 mg/24 hours; or  
- 
 Light chain multiple myeloma: Serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) ≥10 
mg/dL and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda free light chain ratio. 
and clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow or >1 clonal plasmacytoma, but no bone 
marrow involvement 
and at time of diagnosis, 1 or more of the following (attributable to underlying plasma cell 
disorder): 
-  Calcium elevation (>11.5 mg/dL [>2.65 mmol/L]) 
-  Renal insufficiency (creatinine >2 mg/dL [177 µmol/L or more]) 
-  Anaemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL [<6.2 mmol/L] or 2 g/dL [1.25 mmol/L] <normal) 
-  Bone disease (lytic lesions or osteopenia) 
2.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Score of 0, 1, 2 
3.  Life expectancy >3 months 
4.  Relapsed from or refractory to 2 or more different prior therapies, including IMiDs (eg, 
thalidomide, lenalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors, chemotherapy-based regimens, or 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and without further established treatment options 
The key exclusion criteria were the following:

During Part 2 of the study, 4 additional amendments (11-14) were issued. Based on pharmacokinetic and 
efficacy data, the 8 mg/kg dose was chosen as the Part 2 dose (Amendment 11). Additionally, to minimize 
IRRs, particularly at the first full-dose infusion, different combinations of predose infusions, infusion 
volumes, and infusion rates were evaluated (Amendment 12). During Part 2, it was determined that the 
Assessment report

8 mg/kg dose might not saturate a majority of the target (CD38) throughout dosing, as indicated by the 
high intersubject variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, the 8 mg/kg dose in Cohort D was 
changed to 16 mg/kg to assess whether high-dose intensity, leading to high levels of systemic exposure 
and consistent saturation of the CD38 target, was needed to optimize the efficacy of daratumumab 
(Amendment 13). Further, Amendment 14 made a change in the study design to include Cohort E to 
evaluate a Phase 3 drug product (commercial product) that is produced with a larger scale manufacturing 
process. 
The dosing schedule used in the study is summarized in the following figure: 
Figure 8: Dosing schedules: Study GEN501 (Part 1 and Part 2) 
Pre-infusion medication 
In Parts 1 and 2, subjects were to receive: 
•  1 g paracetamol (acetaminophen) PO 
• 
antihistamine (clemastine 1 mg IV, cetirizine 10 mg PO, or equivalent) 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 67/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 100mg IV  before the first 2 pre-doses and before 
the first 2 full daratumumab infusions and since amendment 4 (April 2010) before every 
subsequent infusion. The dose could be decreased to 50 mg following Visit 4 in Part 2 of 
the study if no significant infusion reactions were noted) 
Post-infusion medication 
In Part 2, all subjects were to receive 20 to 25 mg methylprednisolone PO, or equivalent, on the first and 
second days after all full-dose infusions. For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications (eg, 
subjects with FEV1 <75%), the following post-infusion medications were permitted: 
• 
• 
• 
Objectives 
antihistamine (clemastine 1 mg IV, cetirizine 10 mg PO, or equivalent) on the first and 
second days after all full-dose infusions 
salbutamol aerosol 
controller medications (eg, inhaled corticosteroids ± long-acting beta agonists for 
subjects with asthma; long-acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium or salmeterol ± 
inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) 
The primary objective of this study was to establish the safety profile of daratumumab given as 
monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma to at least 2 different cytoreductive 
therapies and without further established treatment options. 
The secondary objectives were:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To establish the pharmacokinetic profile of daratumumab after single and multiple infusions for 
both phase 2 and phase 3 drug products.  
To evaluate the efficacy of monotherapy daratumumab in the proposed patient population. 
To establish safe dose levels for future studies with daratumumab.  
To optimize pre-infusion medication and infusion parameters for daratumumab.  
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the drug and biomarkers of daratumumab’s mechanism of 
action, infusion reactions and clinical response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), which was defined as the proportion of 
patients who achieved a partial response (PR) or better. Objective response evaluations were made based 
on assessments from a computerized algorithm using the International Multiple Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Durie 2006, Rajkumar 2011). 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
Time to response, defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date of 
initial documentation of a response (PR or better) 
Time to best response, defined as the time between the date of first dose of daratumumab and 
the date of the initial evaluation of the best response (PR or better) to treatment 
•  Reduction of serum/urine M-protein or free light-chain reduction, defined as the percent change 
from baseline at each post-baseline assessment visit in the quantification of the corresponding 
serum/urine M-protein or FLC, according to the measurable type at baseline.  
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 68/119 
 
 
 
 
•  Change in bone marrow % plasma cells, based on results from either biopsy or aspirate.  
•  Clinical benefit rate, defined as the proportion of patients with best response of minor response 
(MR) or better (including PR, VGPR, CR and sCR).  
• 
• 
Time to progression (TTP), defined as the number of days from the date of the first infusion to the 
date of the first record of disease progression (IMWG criteria), confirmed by 2 consecutive 
assessments. 
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time between the date of first dose of 
daratumumab and either disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.  
•  Duration of response (DOR), calculated from the date of the initial documentation of a response 
(PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (IMWG criteria). 
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as the number of days from administration of the first infusion (day 
1) to the date of death. 
Sample size 
For Part 2, up to 80 subjects could be enrolled, for a maximum of 112 subjects enrolled across both parts. 
With the descriptive statistics methodology for the primary endpoint in mind, the impact of different 
sample sizes on the descriptive statistics is presented by the probability of making at least one 
observation of an event with rare incidence. 
In addition, 2 sets of safety stopping rules were defined for Part 2: a set defined per cohort (N ≤30) and 
another set for all cohorts combined (N ≤80). A stopping rule was triggered if the number of subjects 
experiencing a CAE (critical adverse event) was greater than or equal to the number shown in the Study 
Protocol for the indicated number of subjects enrolled. A CAE was defined as s study drug-related serious 
TEAEs with an onset within 48 hours after the start of the daratumumab infusion that corresponded to 
CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, did not respond to symptomatic therapy, and did not resolve within 6 hours 
from onset of the event. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. For each observed response category, a 2-sided 
95% exact confidence interval (CI) was presented. For the calculation of ORR, those patients who were 
not evaluable for response were to be considered non-responders. The clinical benefit rate would be 
analysed similarly to the primary endpoint.  
Additionally, in Part 2, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) were 
provided to summarize time to first response and time to best response for responders in each treatment 
group. No inferential analysis was performed.

Recruitment 
A total of 72 patients participated in the study. The study sites for Part 2 were in Denmark (2 sites), 
Sweden (2 sites), Netherlands (1 site), and the United States (1 site).  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was amended 14 times, this included change of pre- and post-infusion medication, 
predose and infusion rate. The key amendments were the following: 
•  9th  amendment  (27  June  2011):  the  dosing  period  was  expanded  to  8  weeks  with  weekly 
infusions followed by bi-weekly infusions for additional 16 weeks. 
•  11th amendment (19 October 2012): the dose chosen for Part 2 was 8 mg/kg, and the treatment 
duration was increased up to 96 weeks or until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.  
•  13th  amendment  (28  June  2013):  schedule  D  changes  to  16  mg/kg  daratumumab  to  assess 
whether  high  levels  of  systemic  exposure  and  consistent  saturation  of  the  CD38  target  was 
needed to optimize efficacy of daratumumab. 
•  14th amendment (02-dec-2013): the study design was changed to include Schedule E to evaluate 
the Phase 3 drug product. 
The major protocol violations in the study are summarized in the tables below.

Study GEN503 
Study GEN503 was an open label, international, multicenter, dose escalating phase 1/2 trial investigating 
the safety of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide (25 mg orally on Days 1 through 21 of each 
28 day cycle) and dexamethasone (total dose of approximately 40 mg weekly) in patients with relapsed 
or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The design of the study is presented in Table 50.

Table 42: Design of study GEN503 
The first subject started treatment on 17 March 2014, and the last subject started treatment on 13 August 
2014. As of the clinical cutoff date 4 subjects from Phase 1 (n=13) and 6 subjects from Phase 2 (n=32) 
had discontinued treatment. 
In Phase 2, 32 subjects were treated with 16 mg/kg daratumumab in combination with LEN/Dex. At the 
time of clinical cutoff, 81% of subjects received at least 7 treatment cycles (26 of 32 subjects). The 
median number of treatment cycles was 8 cycles (range of 1.0; 11.0). Twenty-six (26) of 32 subjects 
were continuing treatment. 
The majority of subjects (81%) in Phase 2 were male and all subjects were White. In Phase 2, 66% (21/32 
subjects) had received a prior PI and IMiD, and 22% (7/32) were double refractory to the most recent PI 
and IMiD. 
Efficacy analyses from Phase 2 (16 mg/kg daratumumab) showed the following: 
- 
Twenty-eight (28) of 32 subjects (88%) had an ORR of PR or better; 7 subjects had a stringent 
CR, 1 subject had a CR, and 9 subjects had a VGPR. 
-  Response to 16 mg/kg daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone was 
rapid and durable. The median time to response was approximately 1 month. A median duration 
of response was not reached at the time of clinical cutoff; however, 93% of responders remained 
progression-free and alive after 6 months on treatment. 
-  At the time of clinical cutoff, disease progression had occurred in 5 subjects (16%). The median 
time to progression and a median PFS rate were not reached; however, 84% of subjects remained 
progression-free after 6 months. 
-  All subjects had substantial reductions in paraprotein from baseline; 31 subjects had at least a 
50% reduction in paraprotein from baseline and 22 subjects had at least a 90% reduction in 
paraprotein from baseline. 
-  All responders who had bone marrow plasma cell data at baseline and first post-baseline 
measurement (20 subjects) had complete or near complete clearance of malignant plasma cells 
from their bone marrow (ie, <5% plasma cells remaining). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 86/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study population included patients who were heavily pre-treated and highly refractory, thus standard 
treatment options such as alkylating agents, ASCT, bortezomib and lenalidomide were exhausted. The 
patient population was not only refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide, but 95% of the study 
population in the MMY2002study was refractory towards the newer drugs, pomalidomide and carfilzomib. 
Patients with poor renal function and compromised haematology parameters were allowed to be included 
in the studies.  
The recommended dose of 16 mg/kg was selected on the basis of the part 1 of Study GEN501 and study 
MMY2002. The dose of 16 mg/kg seems to offer a better antitumor activity than 8 mg/kg with an 
acceptable safety profile and to some extent comparable toxicity showed by the dose 8 mg/kg. Taking 
into account the PK data and the target saturation threshold for CD38, the selection of 16 mg/kg appears 
reasonable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The GEN501 and MMY2002 studies showed that the 16 mg/kg dose met the protocol-specified criteria for 
continuation of an ORR of 15%. At 16 mg/kg, daratumumab, the response was rapid and durable, a total 
of 31 patients achieved response of PR or better based on IRC assessment; the ORR was 29% (95% CI: 
21%, 39%). The responses were rapid with a median time to response of 1 month and the median 
duration of response was 7.4 months. The ORR was consistent across different clinically relevant 
subgroups, including those refractory to newer drugs, such as pomalidomide or carfilzomib. The ORRs of 
daratumumab in these populations (28% to 33%) were similar to the overall population (29% to 36%).  
The data also demonstrated that 3 patients (3%) achieved stringent CR and 13 patients (12%) achieved 
VGPR or better in the MMY2002 study, while 5% had stringent CR in the GEN501 study. This depth of 
response, a combined VGPR or better rate of 11% is high for a single-agent therapy, when compared with 
other recently approved therapies, especially given the refractoriness of the study population. The 
median OS was 17.5 months for patients who received 16 mg/kg  daratumumab. All patients with 
stringent CR/CR are still on treatment, with longest follow-up of 21.4 months.  
Whether daratumumab can change the response of subsequent therapies due to its novel mechanism of 
action or whether it will be possible to identify potential predictors of response and resistance remains to 
be elucidated. In the ongoing and future studies as MMY3003 and MMY3004, the Applicant is planning to 
perform translational biomarker studies, analysis of CD38 expression, subsets of CD38+Tregs and 
CD38+ Bregs, enzymatic activity of CD38 and T cell clonality, genome sequencing and mRNA sequencing 
of CD38+ MM cell, and correlate this with clinical response/progression. The CHMP recommended the 
applicant to provide these data once available.  
The Applicant has initiated an Early Access Programme in the U.S.  which is being conducted under a 
clinical trial protocol (54767414MMY3010), this programme will also be expanded to include European 
countries. The objective of this programme is to provide early access to single agent daratumumab and 
collect additional data while the medication is not commercially available. By this program, over 600 
patients will receive daratumumab. Multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of 
therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) or whose disease 
is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD will be eligible for the programme, thus the patient 
population is similar to the present study group. The CHMP recommended the applicant to provide the 
results of the US (?) Early Access Programme. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The absence of a control arm and the small number of patients treated with daratumumab in studies 
MMY2002 and GEN501 impacts on the interpretation of the clinical benefit of daratumumab in the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 87/119 
 
 
 
 
a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease 
progression on the last therapy.  
To further support the results obtained in studies MMY2002 and GEN501, the Applicant provided historical 
previously published data. Although such a comparison should be done cautiously, an ORR of 29%-36% 
is quite high for monotherapy in this clinical setting and a clinical benefit for daratumumab, can be 
considered established, but a confirmation from  phase III comparative studies is needed in order to 
better quantify the magnitude of the effect.  
The Applicant has proposed to submit the final CSR for Phase 3 studies of daratumumab in combination 
with lenalidomide/low-dose dexamethasone (MMY3003) and of daratumumab in combination with 
bortezomib/low dose dexamethasone (MMY3004) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma which are currently ongoing to meet this requirement. These studies are expected to generate 
comprehensive data to confirm the benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication. 
Therefore, the CHMP has recommended imposing specific obligations in Annex II to the marketing 
authorization for the submission of the final results of ongoing Phase 3 studies MMY3003 and MMY3004. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data available are adequate to support the efficacy of daratumumab in the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a 
proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting the 
approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3003, a phase III randomised study 
investigating lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in patients with previously 
treated multiple myeloma. 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting the 
approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3004, a phase III randomised study 
investigating bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in patients with previously 
treated multiple myeloma.

One subject on daratumumab monotherapy developed a skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) during the 
course of treatment (Study GEN501). 
One subject on daratumumab monotherapy was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma with metastases (origin 
most likely the colon) and was withdrawn from the study (Study GEN501, Part 2). 
One subject in combination therapy with daratumumab was reported to have gastric adenocarcinoma 
(Study GEN503). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event 
In the 16 mg/kg monotherapy group, 50 subjects (32%) experienced treatment-emergent SAEs. The 
most common were pneumonia in 9 subjects (6%), general physical health deterioration, pyrexia (each 
in 5 subjects [3%]), and hypercalcemia in 4 subjects (3%). All other SAEs occurred in 3 or fewer subjects 
(Table 65).

System Organ Class and Preferred Term; All Treated Analysis Set (Studies: MMY2002, 
GEN501 and MMY1002) 
Deaths 
Fifteen deaths occurred within 30 days of last dose (Table 66). 
In the 16 mg/kg monotherapy group, 11 subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of study drug due 
to progressive disease, and 3 subjects died due to TEAEs not considered related to daratumumab (Table 
7). One additional subject (in the 8 mg/kg group) died within 30 days of the last dose of study drug due 
to progressive disease (Table 10). 
In the total population, 15 subjects (6%) died within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. No TEAE with 
a fatal outcome (in 3 subjects [2%]) was considered by the investigator to be related to daratumumab

(cardiorespiratory  arrest  due  to  H1N1  influenza,  general  physical  health  deterioration  secondary  to 
aspiration pneumonia, and pneumonia). 
Across all dose groups, 11 subjects (5%) experienced a Grade 5 TEAE. Ten of these were in the 16 mg/kg 
group; these were general physical health deterioration in 5 subjects; respiratory failure, pneumonia, 
cardiorespiratory arrest, hepatic failure, and hypercalcemia (each in 1 subject). 
A total of 56 deaths were recorded (24% of the integrated safety population); of these, 46/56 deaths 
(82%) were due to progression of disease.  
Three subjects in the 16 mg/kg group who died due to a TEAE. One subject from Study MMY2002 died of 
cardiorespiratory arrest due to H1N1 influenza. One subject from Study MMY2002 died due to general 
physical  health  deterioration  secondary  to  aspiration  pneumonia,  and  a  second  subject  from  Study 
GEN501 (Part 2) died due to pneumonia. None of the fatal TEAEs were considered related to study drug.

Laboratory findings 
Anaemia and Thrombocytopenia 
Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are commonly found in patients with Multiple Myeloma; anaemia being 
included in the CRAB-criteria indicating treatment-requiring Multiple Myeloma. In the 16 mg/kg group of 
Study MMY2002, 3% of responders had Grade 3 or 4 AEs of anaemia compared to 32% of non-responders. 
Likewise,  in  the  16  mg/kg  group  of  Study  MMY2002,  7%  of  responders  had  Grade  3  or  4  AEs  of 
thrombocytopenia compared to 24% of non-responders.  
Leukopenia/Neutropenia 
In the 16 mg/kg group, of 154 of subjects with Grade 0-2 leukopenia at baseline, 26% (17%) worsened 
to Grade 3 and 3 (2%) worsened to Grade 4 during treatment. This pattern was similar to that observed 
across groups. 
In the 16 mg/kg group, of 155 subjects with Grade 0-2 neutropenia at baseline, 25 (16%) worsened to 
Grade 3 and 6 (4%) worsened to Grade 4 during treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia 
were reported in 34 (22%) of these subjects, 19 (12%) of which were considered Grade 3-4. This was 
slightly higher than across dosing groups where treatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia were reported in 
38 (16%), 21 (9%) of which were considered Grade 3-4. 
No statistically significant trend in the TEAE rate of neutropenia or of neutropenic fever was found with 
increasing  exposure,  and  no  patients  discontinued  daratumumab  due  to  neutropenia  in  any  of  the 
treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 100/119 
 
 
 
 
 
Lymphopenia 
In the 16 mg/kg group, of 138 subjects with baseline Grade 0-2 lymphocyte count, 46 (33%) worsened 
to Grade 3 and 6 (4%) worsened to Grade 4 during treatment. This was similar to the findings across 
dosing groups. 
Natural Killer Cells 
Natural  Killer  Cells  counts  decreased  or  remained  low  in  the  majority  of  subjects  treated  in  the 
daratumumab monotherapy studies. the incidence of TEAEs of infection and infestation did not increase 
over time (ie, the incidence was 50% during the first 6 months of treatment and 38% after 6 months of 
treatment. 
In the 16 mg/kg group, of 111 subjects with normal NK cell counts at baseline, 108 were low at some time 
during the study, and 3 remained normal. All of the subjects with low or high NK cells at baseline had low 
NK cells at some time during the study. 
In the total population, 137 of 143 subjects with normal NK cell counts at baseline were low at some time 
during the study, and 6 remained normal. All of the subjects with low or high NK cell counts at baseline 
had low NK cell counts during the study. 
Chemistry 
Chemistry laboratory abnormalities generally occurred with a low incidence, most were grade 1-2 and 
most were related to underlying Multiple Myeloma. Grade 3-4 changes were infrequent. Across dosing 
groups,  the  most  common  Grade  3-4  chemistry  laboratory  abnormalities  were  hypercalcemia  (15 
subjects (6%), Grade 4 in 7 subjects), and hyponatremia (13 subjects (6%), Grade 4 in 1 subject).  
Electrocardiogram Assessment 
The clinical and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data demonstrate that daratumumab does not cause 
clinically relevant QT prolongation. There were no subjects with QTcF values >500 ms or changes from 
baseline of >60 ms, and no TEAE of cardiac arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation was reported. 
In Study GEN501 Part 1, no new QTcF above 500 msec, no change from baseline >60 msec, and no TEAEs 
of QT prolongation were reported at doses at 2 mg/kg or higher. No subject had an abnormal U wave or 
a new QTcF >500 ms. No subject had a >60 ms change from baseline for QTcF. In Study GEN501 Part 2, 
no subject had an abnormal, clinically significant ECG, based on investigator’s overall interpretation, at 
baseline or at any timepoint during treatment. Based on central review of ECG data, no subject had a 
QTcF >500 ms or a >60 ms change from baseline. No TEAEs of QT prolongation were reported.  
In Study MMY1002, 12-lead triplicate ECGs were digitally recorded at the sites and then transmitted to a 
central  laboratory  for  measurement  of  cardiac  intervals  and  morphologic  assessment  by  a  central 
cardiologist. There were no clinically significant changes in ECG data observed in either the 8 mg/kg or 16 
mg/kg group during the study (See discussion on clinical pharmacology). Based on central ECG review, no 
subject  had  a  QTcF  value  >500  msec  or  an  increase  of  >60  msec  from  baseline.  No  TEAEs  of  QT 
prolongation were reported. 
Haemolysis Analysis 
No subjects in the 16 mg/kg group experienced TEAEs of hemolysis. 
In Study GEN501, free haemoglobin, haptoglobin, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, and 
haemoglobin levels were performed and analysed at a central laboratory to evaluate haemolysis. In the 
32 subjects in Part 1, 3 subjects had TEAEs of haemolysis, 5 subjects had TEAEs of free haemoglobin 
present,  and  1  subject  had  a  TEAE  of  haptoglobin  decreased;  all  of  which  were  reported  in  subjects 
receiving ≤1 mg/kg of daratumumab. All events were Grade 1, events (with the exception of a Grade 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 101/119 
 
 
 
 
free  haemoglobin  present)  that  resolved;  and  no  event  resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  decreases  in 
haemoglobin (>1 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin during a daratumumab dosing window pre-dose to 12 
hours post dose). One subject had only a decrease in haptoglobin without a concomitant increase in free 
haemoglobin or elevation of LDH, and 2 subjects had elevations of free haemoglobin without concomitant 
decreases  in  haptoglobin  or  elevations  of  LDH.  Analysis  of  all  laboratory  values  of  free  haemoglobin, 
haptoglobin,  LDH,  total  bilirubin,  and  haemoglobin  in  all  subjects  in  Study  GEN501  Part  1  showed  no 
consistent pattern of haemolysis.  
Direct and Indirect Coomb’s Test 
The binding of daratumumab to CD38 on RBCs triggers a positive readout on indirect Coombs testing, 
which interferes with the ability to detect red cell alloantibodies. CD38 is expressed at very low levels on 
erythrocytes.  Data  indicate  that  daratumumab  interferes  with  indirect  Coombs  testing  and  will  make 
complete blood typing difficult for subjects receiving treatment.  
Transfusion Usage and Red Blood Cell Transfusion-related Reactions 
In  the  16  mg/kg  group,  48  subjects  received  208  transfusions;  29%  of  subjects  received  RBC 
transfusions.  This  was  similar  to  the  incidence  in  the  total  population;  65  subjects  received  270 
transfusions (24% of subjects received RBC transfusions). A summary of blood transfusions is presented 
in Table 67. No TEAEs related to RBC transfusions were reported.

In the 16 mg/kg group, 84 (54%) of the subjects were male while 72 (46%) were female. No differences 
in the rate of AEs between males and females were observed.  
Race 
There  was  an  overrepresentation  of  White  study  participants  (76%)  in  the  16  mg/kg  group.  No 
differences in the rate of AEs between races were observed.  
Baseline Renal Function 
In the 16 mg/kg group, 95 (61%) of subjects had baseline CrCl ≥60 mL/min, 56 (36%) had baseline CrCl 
between 30 to <60 mL/min while 5 (3%) had baseline CrCl <30 mL/min. In the latter group there were 
too few subjects to make meaningful comparisons. In the two former groups, the incidences of AEs were 
similar.  
Baseline Hepatic Function 
In the 16 mg/kg group, 134 (86%) subjects had normal hepatic function at baseline while 21 (13%) had 
mildly impaired hepatic function at baseline. Overall, the incidence of AEs by baseline hepatic function 
was similar to the total 16 mg/kg group. When comparing subjects with mildly impaired hepatic function 
with all subjects, there was a higher incidence of SAEs (9 subjects (43%) vs. 50 subjects (32%)), Grade

≥3 AEs (15 subjects (71%) vs. 88 subjects (56%)) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (4 
subjects (19%) vs. 6 subjects (4%)). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with daratumumab (see discussion on 
clinical safety). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the 16 mg/kg group in the monotherapy studies, a total of 6 patients discontinued treatment due to 
AEs. None of these AEs were related to daratumumab as determined by the investigator. Across all 
treatment groups, a total of 11 subjects discontinued due to AEs. Five were considered drug related. Four 
of the 5 occurred in the ≤4 mg/kg group and 1 occurred in the 24 mg/kg group. Two of the patients in the 
≤4 mg/kg group who discontinued due to AEs did not receive prophylactic post-infusion steroids, as the 
protocol did not call for it at the time.  
In one of the 5 patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs this was due to hepatic function abnormal. 
The remaining 4 patients discontinued due to infusion related reactions.  
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from a total of 331 subjects treated with daratumumab (237 as monotherapy, 94 as part of 
a combination therapy regimen) is considered sufficient to evaluate the safety profile of daratumumab 
under conditional approval. 
The proposed treatment dose applied for (16 mg/kg) corresponds to the treatment dose of the majority 
of subjects included in the clinical studies (240/331). Long term data (exposure ≥6 months) has been 
obtained from 52 subjects however, there is limited data on the long term use >2 years of daratumumab. 
Long term extension trials are ongoing, and will provide additional safety information when completed. 
Long term use (>2 years) is included in the RMP under missing information. 
The majority of subjects (99%) in the 3 pivotal studies experienced AEs. Most notably, infusion related 
reactions were common which also justifies the recommendation of both pre- and post-infusion steroid 
treatment. Other frequently occurring AEs were fatigue, nausea, anaemia, neutropenia, back pain, cough 
and thrombocytopenia. 
In  the  16  mg/kg  group,  the  most  common  infections  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infections, 
nasopharyngitis,  pneumonia  and  sinusitis.  Infections  were  most  frequent  within  the  first  6  months  of 
treatment. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. No subjects had febrile neutropenia. The 
overall incidence of infections and infestations was  similar to the total population and consistent with 
underlying Multiple Myeloma. Of note, the incidence of opportunistic infections was low (2% per specified 
opportunistic infection). No AEs of reactivated HBV or HCV were reported. Infections have been classified 
as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  were  IRRs  (48%);  see  section  4.4.  Other  frequently 
reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were fatigue (39%), pyrexia (21%), cough (21%), nausea (27%), 
back  pain  (23%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (20%),  anaemia  (27%),  neutropenia  (22%)  and 
thrombocytopenia (20%) (SmPC section 4.8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 104/119 
 
 
 
 
Infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs)  were  reported  in  approximately  half  of  all  patients  treated  with 
daratumumab. Monitor such patients throughout the infusion and the post-infusion period. The majority 
(95%) of IRRs occurred at the first infusion. Five percent of all patients had an IRR at more than one 
infusion.  Symptoms  predominantly  included  (≥5%)  nasal  congestion,  chills,  cough,  allergic  rhinitis, 
throat  irritation,  dyspnoea,  and  nausea,  and  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Severe  IRRs  (3%) 
including bronchospasm (1.3%), hypertension (0.6%), and hypoxia (0.6%) were also reported (SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Patients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids to reduce the risk 
of IRRs prior to treatment with daratumumab. Daratumumab infusion should be interrupted for IRRs of 
any severity. Medical management/supportive treatment for IRRs should be instituted as needed. The 
infusion rate should be reduced when re-starting the infusion. For the prevention of delayed IRRs, oral 
corticosteroids  should  be  administered  to  all  patients  the  first  and  second  day  after  all  infusions. 
Additionally  the  use  of  post-infusion  medications  (e.g.  inhaled  corticosteroids,  short  and  long  acting 
bronchodilators) should be considered for patients with a history of obstructive pulmonary disorder to 
manage  respiratory  complications  should  they  occur  (SmPC  sections  4.2  and  4.8).  Infusion  Related 
Reactions have been classified as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
In study MMY1002, all nine subjects experienced a positive result in indirect Coomb’s Test after treatment 
with daratumumab. Daratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may 
result  in  a  positive  indirect  Coombs  test.  Daratumumab-mediated  positive  indirect  Coombs  test  may 
persist  for  up  to  6  months  after  the  last  daratumumab  infusion.  It  should  be  recognised  that 
daratumumab bound to RBCs may mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. 
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Patients should be typed and 
screened prior to starting daratumumab treatment (SmPC section 4.4). 
However, there was no reported interference with the clinical decision to administer blood transfusions. 
Moreover, no AEs were reported in relation to blood transfusions.  
In the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centres should be notified of this interference with 
indirect antiglobulin tests. If an emergency transfusion is required, non-cross-matched 
ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
An additional risk minimisation measure is considered to be needed to address this safety concern. To 
make HCPs and Blood banks aware of the risk associated with blood typing, educational materials will be 
distributed that include an HCP and blood bank brochure and a patient alert card. Survey tools will be used 
to measure (and increase) the awareness of the risk of interference of blood typing associated with 
daratumumab. Final results will be presented in the next PSUR/PBRER after the survey has been 
concluded (see RMP). 
Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to 
disrupt daratumumab binding or genotyping. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT 
treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using 
DTT-treated RBCs (SmPC section 4.5). Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive Indirect 
Coombs’ test) has been classified as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Daratumumab targets CD38 which is expressed on NK cells. This is evidenced by an expected decrease in 
the  number  of  NK  cells.  However,  this  was  not  accompanied  by  an  overall  increase  in  infections  or 
infestations and infections did not become more frequent with time on treatment. Prolonged decrease in 
NK cells has been classified as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
There is a theoretical risk of haemolysis. Continuous monitoring for this safety signal will be performed in 
clinical studies and post-marketing safety data (SmPC section 4.8). Intravascular haemolysis has been 
classified as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016

The immunogenicity of daratumumab has been evaluated in 2 monotherapy daratumumab studies 
(GEN501 and MMY2002) using validated Charles River ECLIA methods. Limitations in detecting 
anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of daratumumab cannot be ruled 
out. Therefore, the Applicant will develop a new method for detecting ADAs (See RMP). Immunogenicity 
has been classified as an important potential risk in the RMP however until further information are 
available, the following text is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC: ‘‘Patients (n = 199) were evaluated for 
anti -therapeutic antibody responses to daratumumab at multiple time points during treatment and up to 
8 weeks following the end of treatment. Following the start of daratumumab treatment, none of the 
patients tested positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies. However, the employed assay has limitations 
in detecting anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of daratumumab. 
Therefore, the incidence of antibody development might not have been reliably determined”. 
Among AEs of higher grades, haematologic AEs were common, but no clear dose-dependency was noted 
for grade 5 TEAEs. In the 16 mg/kg group, 6% of the patients had grade 5 TEAEs, 4% of the patients in 
the < 4 mg/kg group, and none in either the 8 or 24 mg/kg groups. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 TEAE 
were similar across all dose groups. 
Apart  from  pneumonia,  common  SAEs  were  general  physical  health  deterioration,  pyrexia  and 
hypercalcemia. Three deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose of study drug which were caused by 
adverse events but none were considered related to study drug. 
Anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia were experienced by many study subjects. However, anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia  are  frequently  associated  with  Multiple  Myeloma.  It  was  apparent  that  higher 
incidences of anaemia and thrombocytopenia were observed among non-responders to daratumumab as 
compared  with  responders,  therefore  they  are  more  likely  due  to  the  underlying  disease  than  to  the 
daratumumab treatment.  
Leukopenia  and  neutropenia  were  also  observed, No  statistically  significant  trend  in  the  TEAE  rate  of 
neutropenia or of neutropenic fever was found with increasing exposure, and no patients discontinued 
daratumumab due to neutropenia in any of the treatment.  
Most chemistry laboratory abnormalities occurred with a low incidence, were of low grade and most were 
related to underlying Multiple Myeloma. There were no safety signals identified in a review of vital signs. 
No  formal  QT  studies  of  daratumumab  were  conducted,  but  ECGs  were  systematically  collected  and 
reviewed.  Although  few  ECG  abnormalities  were  detected,  in  Study  GEN501  Part  2  a  statistically 
significant QT-prolongation was indeed observed. Although this was not observed in Part 1 of the study 
and may in part be attributable to an observed increase in heart rate, however, as discussed in Clinical 
Pharmacology, conflicting results were observed in Study GEN501 Part 1 and Part 2.  
No differences in the incidence of AEs were observed with regard to age groups, sex, race, baseline renal 
or hepatic function, geographical area or drug product. For renal and hepatic function it is noted that some 
groups contain only few subjects. 
Due  to  the  large,  overlapping  CIs,  no  statistically  significant  trend  in  the  TEAE  rate  was  found  with 
increasing drug exposure. IRRs were the most frequently observed TEAEs in all treatment groups, but 
most of them were grade 1 or 2. In the 16 mg/kg group, IRRs were reported in 48% of the patients and  
55% in the 8 mg/kg group; 3% and 4% of patients, respectively, had Grade 3 IRRs, but no grade 4 IRR 
was noted in the two dose groups. All IRRs were well-managed, and none resulted in discontinuation from 
treatment.  
Women  of  child-bearing  potential  should  use  effective  contraception  during,  and  for  3  months  after 
cessation of daratumumab treatment (SmPC section 4.6).  
There  are  no  human  or  animal  data  to  assess  the  risk  of  daratumumab  use  during  pregnancy.  IgG1 
monoclonal antibodies are known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 106/119 
 
 
 
 
daratumumab  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  the  benefit  of  treatment  to  the  woman  is 
considered to outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
medicine, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus (SmPC section 4.6).  
It is not known whether daratumumab is excreted into human or animal milk.  Maternal IgG is excreted 
in human milk, but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial amounts as they are 
degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed. The effect of daratumumab on newborns/infants 
is  unknown.  A  decision  should  be  made  whether  to  discontinue  breast-feeding  or  to  discontinue 
daratumumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman (SmPC section 4.6). Use in pregnancy and lactation is included in the RMP under 
missing information. 
Due to the small population of patients ≥75 years (n=18), ‘‘Use in the elderly over 75 years’’ is added as 
missing  information  in  the  RMP  until  Phase  3  trials  are  completed.  Additional  analyses  of  covariates 
(including age ≥75 years) will be done with larger sample sizes as current Phase 3 trials reach maturation 
(see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
There  has  been  no  experience  of  overdosage  in  clinical  studies.  Doses  up  to  24  mg/kg  have  been 
administered  intravenously  in  a  clinical  study.  There  is  no  known  specific  antidote  for  daratumumab 
overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately. Daratumumab 
is not expected to have a potential for abuse (SmPC section 4.9).  
Daratumumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However fatigue 
has been reported in patients taking daratumumab and this should be taken into account when driving or 
using machines (SmPC section 4.7). 
No  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  However,  as  daratumumab  is  an  IgG,  renal 
excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism is considered unlikely.  
In the group treated with the proposed dose of 16 mg/kg, a total of 6 subjects discontinued treatment due 
to  AEs.  None  of  these  were  related  to  daratumumab  as  determined  by  the  investigator.  Across  all 
treatment groups, additionally 5 subjects discontinued treatment due to AEs which were indeed related to 
daratumumab as determined by the investigator. Four of the 5 AEs were IRRs but 2 of these occurred 
before the protocol was amended to include post-treatment administration of steroids. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of daratumumab 16 mg/kg dosing regimen is considered acceptable for use in 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy 
included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease 
progression on the last therapy and appears favourable. The adverse events appeared manageable.  
The CHMP also considers the following measure necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
The safety data provided based on a single-arm, open-label pivotal study was quite limited. Additional 
safety data from the ongoing comparative phase III studies assessing lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
with or without daratumumab (study  MMY3003)  and bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without 
daratumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (study MMY3004), will be 
provided to further establish the safety profile of daratumumab.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Darzalex (daratumumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU, and is to be approved under conditional 
marketing authorisation. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Daratumumab monotherapy at 16 mg/kg achieved an ORR of 29% in this studied population. The 
response data were supported by the GEN501 study, which had an ORR of 36% among patients treated 
with 16 mg/kg daratumumab. The ORR was consistent across different clinically relevant subgroups, such 
as number of prior lines of therapy, type of myeloma (IgG, non IgG), baseline renal function, refractory 
status including those refractory to newer drugs, such as pomalidomide or carfilzomib. The ORRs of 
daratumumab in these populations (28% to 33%) were similar to the overall population (29% to 36%).  
The responses were rapid with a median time to response of 1 month and the median duration of 
response was 7.4 months. 
A response of VGPR or better rate of 12% in the MMY2002 study was demonstrated.  In the MMY2002 and 
GEN501, 3% and 5% of the patients respectively achieved stringent CR/CR.  
For the combined studies, the median OS was 20.1 months after a median duration of follow-up of 20.77 
months. Percentages of events in the MMY2002 and GEN501 were 53.8% and 38.1% respectively, with a 
24-month OS rate of 41.3% and 57.4% respectively. The median OS for patients in the MMY2002 study 
who were refractory to pomalidomide was 13.8 months and 18.7 months in the GEN501 study. For 
patients refractory to carfilzomib, the median OS in study MMY2002 was 15.2 months and NE in the 
GEN501. Finally, the median OS in the MMY2002 study who were refractory to both pomalidomide and 
carfilzomib was 13.8 months and 16.5 months in the GEN501 study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The design of the study with no comparative arm is of concern because the ORR, PFS, and OS data cannot 
be directly compared to other treatment results in the same population. To further support the results 
obtained in studies MMY2002 and GEN501, the Applicant will submit the final CSR for study MMY3003 an 
ongoing phase 3, two arm, randomized, parallel-group study designed to compare the efficacy of 
daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) to that of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (Rd) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and also for study  
MMY3004,  phase 3, two arm, randomized, parallel-group study designed to compare the efficacy of 
daratumumab when combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) to that of bortezomib and 
dexamethasone (Vd) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
Therefore, the CHMP has recommended two specific obligations in Annex II to the marketing 
authorization for the submission of the final results of ongoing studies MMY3003 and MMY3004.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were IRRs (48%); see section 4.4. Other frequently 
reported adverse reactions (≥  20%) were fatigue (39%), pyrexia (21%), cough (21%), nausea (27%), 
back pain (23%), upper respiratory tract infection (20%), anaemia (27%), neutropenia (22%) and 
thrombocytopenia (20%). 
Most AEs were of lower grades. Daratumumab targets CD38 which is expressed on NK cells and 
consequently the majority of subjects experienced a temporal decrease or had continually low 
measurements of NK cells. However, the overall incidence of infections and infestations remained 
comparable to the total population and consistent with underlying Multiple Myeloma. Notably, the 
incidence of opportunistic infections was low (2%).  
While 15% of study subjects experienced AEs leading to infusion delays and 40% of subjects experienced 
AEs leading to infusion interruptions, the number of patients who permanently discontinued treatment 
due to AEs was low.  
The incidence of death within 30 days of the last dose of study drug was relatively low. While 15 subjects 
in total died within this period, only 3 of the deaths were caused by AEs and none were considered related 
to study drug.  
In study MMY1002, all 9 subjects experienced a positive result in indirect Coomb’s Test after treatment 
with daratumumab. However, there was no reported interference with the clinical decision to administer 
blood transfusions and no AEs were reported in relation to blood transfusions.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety data provided based on a single-arm, open-label pivotal study was quite limited. Additional 
safety data from the ongoing comparative phase III studies assessing daratumumab versus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone (study MMY3003) and versus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (study MMY3004), will be provided to further establish the safety 
profile of daratumumab.  
No plausible cause for the findings of the statistically significant QTc prolongation in Study GEN501 Part 
2 has been identified. A (thorough) QTc study is not feasible but the Applicant will incorporate more 
well-controlled data collection in a substudy of the ongoing Study SMM2001 to further evaluate a 
relationship between daratumumab concentration and QTc (see RMP). 
Finally, only 11% of the patients treated with the dose of 16 mg/kg were older than 75 years, though the 
ORR was in line with the overall population (31% vs 25%). Use in the elderly ≥ 75 years is included in the 
RMP under missing information (see RMP). 
Limitations in detecting anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of 
daratumumab cannot be ruled out (see discussion on clinical pharamacology). Therefore, the Applicant 
will develop a new method for detecting ADAs (see RMP). 
In study MMY1002, all 9 subjects experienced a positive result in indirect Coomb’s Test after treatment 
with daratumumab. However, there was no reported interference with the clinical decision to administer 
blood transfusions and no AEs were reported in relation to blood transfusions. An additional risk 
minimisation measure is considered to be needed to address this safety concern (see RMP and Annex II).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A positive effect on ORR has been demonstrated for daratumumab monotherapy. Furthermore, the safety 
profile can be acceptable in the context of the stage of the disease. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the positive clinical effect of daratumumab as a single agent drug that has been demonstrated 
in a highly refractory/relapsed patient population and that the safety profile is acceptable and 
manageable, the benefit/risk balance is positive.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Daratumumab, a novel monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the cell surface molecule CD38, has 
shown a durable response rate in a heavily pre-treated population with limited treatment options. Given 
the limitations in the number of patients treated and the design of the studies the applicant has applied 
for a conditional approval.  
The CHMP considered that DARZALEX falls under the scope of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
507/2006 as eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as it belongs to: 
a) Medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000; 
b) Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously 
debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Furthermore, the requirements listed in Article 4 of Commission Regulation No 507/2006 apply to 
daratuzumab on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The benefit/risk balance of the product is positive. 
The ORR of 29% obtained with daratumumab in pivotal study MT103-211 is significant and clinically 
relevant in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a 
proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy despite the absence of confirmatory controlled data. Patients were heavily pretreated, 
and 79.8% and 69.4% had received more than 3 lines of prior therapy in the MMY2002 and GEN501 
studies respectively, further 95% and 95.8% respectively were refractory to both PI’s and IMiD’s. 
Together with an acceptable safety-profile in patients in the proposed indication, the benefit-risk balance 
is considered positive. 
b) It is likely that the Applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of 
daratumumab in the proposed indication. More specifically the Applicant will provide: 
-  Study MMY 3003 a phase 3, two arm, randomized, parallel-group trial of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in patients with previously-treated multiple 
myeloma. 
-  Study MMY 3004, a Phase 3, two arm, randomized, parallel-group trial of bortezomib and 
dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in patients with previously-treated multiple 
myeloma. 
These phase 3 studies of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide/low-dose dexamethasone 
(MMY3003) and bortezomib/low dose dexamethasone (MMY3004) in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma are currently ongoing. A total of 560 and 480 patients respectively are planning to be 
randomized in these studies. These phase III studies are not in the exact same setting where 
daratumumab is authorised. It is anticipated that approximately 240 subjects across both studies 
enrolled will have received 3 or more prior lines of therapy. These studies will therefore provide 
comparative efficacy and safety data for daratumumab in combination with standard backbone therapies 
in a population that overlaps that enrolled in MMY2002 and GEN501. In the absence of controlled 
single-agent data in patients who have exhausted all standard treatments as in MMY2002 and GEN501, 
these studies can provide controlled data in a larger target population within the same condition which will 
further define the benefit-risk of daratumumab in the proposed indication. Both studies are ongoing and 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016

the data will be provided by the applicant for study MMY3003 by the September 2017 and for study 
MMY3004 by December 2016. 
c) The product fulfils an unmet medical need.  
Daratumumab fulfils an unmet medical need for patients with poor long-term prognosis and limited 
treatment alternatives. Daratumumab has a new mechanism of action, a manageable safety profile, and 
treatment with daratumumab was associated with durable response, which provides a major therapeutic 
advantage. 
d) The benefits to the public health of the immediate availability of the product outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required 
In view of the high ORR compared to available treatment options, the immediate availability of DARZALEX 
on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid, 
Imnovid, Farydak and Kyprolis within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of  Darzalex in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent 
and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy is favourable and therefore 
recommends  the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
Assessment report  
EMA/278085/2016  
Page 117/119 
 
 
 
 
 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the launch of DARZALEX (daratumumab) in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials, aiming at increasing 
awareness about the Important Identified Risk of “Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive 
Indirect Coombs’ test)” and providing guidance on how to manage it. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where DARZALEX (daratumumab) is marketed, all HCPs and 
patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense and receive this product have access to/are provided 
with the below. 
The HCPs and Blood Banks educational materials shall contain the following key elements: 
o  The guide for HCPs and Blood Banks, to advice about the risk of interference for blood typing 
and how to minimise it; 
o  The Patient Alert Card. 
The Guide for HCP and Blood Banks shall contain the following key elements: 
o  All  patients  should  be  typed  and  screened  prior  to  start  treatment  with  daratumumab; 
alternatively, phenotyping may also be considered; 
o  Daratumumab-mediated  positive  indirect  Coombs  test  (interfering  with  cross-matching  of 
blood) may persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion; therefore, the HCP 
should advise the patient to carry the Patient Alert Card until 6 months after the treatment 
has ended; 
o  Daratumumab  bound  to  Red  Blood  Cells  (RBCs)  may  mask  the  detection  of  antibodies  to 
minor antigens in the patient’s serum; 
o  The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted; 
o  The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) 
to  disrupt  daratumumab  binding  or  other  locally  validated  methods.  Since  the  Kell  Blood 
group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after 
ruling  out  or  identifying  alloantibodies  using  DTT-treated  RBCs.  Alternatively,  genotyping 
may also be considered; 
o 
o 
In case of urgent need for transfusion, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBC units 
can be administered as per local bank practices; 
In the event of a planned transfusion, the HCPs should notify blood transfusion centres about 
the interference with indirect antiglobulin tests; 
o  Reference to the need to consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC);

o  Reference to the need of giving the Patient Alert Card to the patients and to advise them to 
consult the Package Leaflet (PL). 
The Patient Alert Card shall contain the following key elements: 
o  A  warning  message  for  HCPs  treating  the  patient  at  any  time,  including  in  conditions  of 
emergency, that the patient is using DARZALEX (daratumumab), and that this treatment is 
associated with the Important Identified Risk of Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) 
(Positive  Indirect  Coombs’  test),  which  might  persist  for  up  to  6  months  after  the  last 
product’s infusion; and a clear reference that the patient should continue to carry this card 
until 6 months after the treatment has ended; 
o  Contact details of the DARZALEX (daratumumab) prescriber; 
o  Reference to the need to consult the Package Leaflet (PL). 
• 
 Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing 
authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study 
supporting the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study 
MMY3003, a phase III randomised study investigating lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
with or without daratumumab in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study 
supporting the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study 
MMY3004, a phase III randomised study investigating bortezomib and dexamethasone 
with or without daratumumab in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.

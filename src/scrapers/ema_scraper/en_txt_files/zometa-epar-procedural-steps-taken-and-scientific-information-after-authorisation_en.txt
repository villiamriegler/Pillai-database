1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on additive effect of hypocalcaemia-
causing medicinal products;  
Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC to add information 
for women of child-bearing potential;  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to change 
frequency of uveitis (from "very rare" to "rare"); and  
Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC to revise the text 
on plasma protein binding. 
Furthermore, editorial changes are made to update 
some adverse reaction terms in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC according to MedDRA preferred terms. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

medicinal products known to cause hypocalcaemia, as they 
may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe 
hypocalcaemia (see section 4.5). Serum calcium should be 
measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before 
initiating Zometa therapy. Patients should be adequately 
supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered 
with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop diuretics, since 
both these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in 
a lower serum calcium level for longer periods than 
required. 
Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant while on treatment with Zometa. 
The frequency of uveitis and cardiac arrhythmia (secondary 
to hypocalcaemia) as adverse drug reactions of Zometa 
therapy is ‘rare’ (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people - 
previously ‘very rare’ [may affect up to 1 in 10,000 
people]). 
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed no low affinity 
for the cellular components of human blood. The plasma 
protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging 
from 60% to 77%.

cumulative review of their safety database with respect to 
phase reaction in section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects’.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
(for the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Croatia), and 
to make linguistic corrections (Swedish translation). 
Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to bring 
the Product Information in line with the latest QRD

“arthritis” and “joint swelling”. Based on this review, the 
proposed inclusion of “arthritis” and “joint swelling” as a 
manifestation of the acute phase reaction with the 
frequency “rare” in the SmPC section 4.8 is supported by 
the CHMP. The results of the review of the safety database 
do not change the overall benefit - risk balance for Zometa 
which remains favourable.

cases of hypocalcaemia and on risk factors for 
osteonecrosis and to include in SmPC section 4.8 
additional information on interstitial lung disease. 
The Package Leaflet section 4 was updated in 
accordance to include additional information on 
interstitial lung disease. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
(Malta). 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the 
current QRD template version 8.1.  
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following 
severe hypocalcaemia, including life-threatening, may be 
encountered.  
More extensive information on risk factors for ONJ is added 
to SmPC section 4.4 mentioning that when evaluating an 
individual`s risk of developing ONJ,  the following risk 
factors should be considered: potency of the 
bisphosphonate, route of administration and cumulative 
dose;  cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, 
smoking; history of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, 
invasive dental procedures and poorly fitting dentures. 
Furthermore interstitial lung disease was included in SmPC

and taking into account the discussion paper on 
contraindications in pregnancy (CPMP/3833/03). The 
statement in SPC section 4.6 that "Zometa should not be 
used during pregnancy" is maintained. SPC section 4.6 was 
revised to state that Zometa is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding in line with SPC section 4.3. In addition, 
information on dystocia in rats was moved to SPC section 
5.3. 
Furthermore, minor changes to SPC sections 4.2 and 6.2 
were implemented in order to provide also in section 4.2 
the information that Zometa must not be mixed with 
calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion 
solutions and should be administered as a single 
intravenous solution in a separate infusion line.

that evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 
mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of 
postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), the overall incidence 
of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% 
(75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg 
and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation 
serious adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 
0.6% (33 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic acid 
5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in 
this trial has not been observed in other trials with 
zoledronic acid, including those with Zometa (zoledronic 
acid) 4 mg every 3 4 weeks in oncology patients. The 
mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial 
fibrillation in this single clinical trial is unknown. This 
information is now added in the Summary pof Product 
Characteristics, under section 4.8. 
In addition the section 4.9 (Overdose) has been updated to 
reflect clinical experience with overdose, since renal 
function impairment (including renal failure) and serum 
electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed.  It is recommended that 
in the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions 
should be administered as clinically indicated.

Zometa in paediatric patients have not been established" 
from other parts of section 4.4. The headlines "renal 
insufficiency", "hepatic insufficiency", "osteonecrosis of the 
jaw" and "musculoskeletal pain" are included at relevant 
paragraphs. Under the heading "renal insufficiency" the 
statement "renal deterioration, progression to renal failure 
and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial 
dose or a single dose of Zometa". 2) section 4.8, post 
marketing experience, it is stressed that Zometa is included 
among the biphosphonates, which may cause 
osteonecrosis. "Somnolence" and "bronchoconstriction" is 
included under the category of very rare cases. A warning 
on somnolence was included in the section on driving and

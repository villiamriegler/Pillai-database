2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing avapritinib was 
considered justified based on preliminary non-clinical data showing improved survival as well as 
preliminary clinical data showing an improvement in overall response rate; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, 
abdominal cramping, peptic ulcers and diarrhoea, and life-threatening due to bone marrow failure, 
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly , and poor survival  with 5-year rates of around 60% in patients with 
systemic mastocytosis; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing avapritinib will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data which demonstrate an improved overall response 
rate compared to the current approved medicine. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP therefore recommends the designation of this medicinal product, containing avapritinib as 
an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of mastocytosis. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Mastocytosis is a rare disease characterized by abnormal expansion and accumulation of tissue mast 
cells (MC) in one or multiple organs, which is frequently associated with somatic gain-of-function point 
mutations within the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT (CD117). Manifestations may be limited to the skin 
(cutaneous mastocytosis, CM), as commonly in paediatric cases with spontaneous regression at 
puberty. Or it may be extended to multiple organs (systemic mastocytosis, SM) that may be associated 
with multiorgan dysfunction and shortened survival, as generally seen in adult patients (Pardanani 
2021 Am J Hematol 96: 508– 525). 
Based on histopathological findings and organ damage, SM is divided into indolent SM (ISM), 
smoldering SM (SSM), SM with an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), 
aggressive SM (ASM), and MC leukaemia (MCL). The clinical course and prognosis vary greatly among 
these groups of patients. In all variants of SM and most patients, neoplastic cells display the KIT 
mutation D816V. This suggests that additional KIT-independent molecular defects cause progression.

Page 4/9 
 
 
 
 
 
Indeed, additional oncogenic lesions, including RAS- and TET2 mutations, have recently been identified 
in advanced SM. In patients with SM-AHNMD, such additional lesions are often detectable in the 
‘AHNMD component’ of the disease. Clinically relevant symptoms of SM result from i) malignant MC 
infiltration and the subsequent organ damage seen in advanced SM and/or ii) the release of pro-
inflammatory and vasoactive mediators from MC, found in all disease-variants. (Am J Cancer Res 
2013;3(2):159-172). 
This condition continues to be acceptable for orphan regulatory purposes. 
The approved extension of the therapeutic indication “AYVAKYT is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with moderate to severe symptoms inadequately 
controlled on symptomatic treatment” falls entirely within the orphan indication “treatment of 
mastocytosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor claims that since the application for orphan designation of avapritinib for the treatment of 
mastocytosis in 2018, the treatment paradigm for indolent systemic mastocytosis has not changed, 
and patients have limited treatment options.  
Mastocytosis carry substantial morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) has a good 
prognosis in most cases (Valent 2005). It occurs mainly in children, often regresses during puberty, 
and rarely progresses to SM. In adults however, CM is persistent and often progresses to SM, or it can 
have an associated haematologic disorder, such as hypereosinophilic syndrome that may become 
aggressive (Pottier 2003, Valent 2005).  
Mediator-release symptoms of flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, abdominal cramping, peptic ulcer 
disease, and diarrhoea can be difficult to control, can seriously impact the quality of life of patients 
experiencing these symptoms, and can be life-threatening (Castells 2002, Valent 2005). Infiltration of 
various organs by malignant cells in aggressive forms SM cause the “C-findings” of cytopenias, 
osteoporosis, pathologic fractures, hepatomegaly with ascites and impaired liver function, 
splenomegaly with hypersplenism, malabsorption, hypoalbuminemia, weight loss, or life-threatening 
organopathy in other organ systems (O'Brien 2004). 
The disease course of CM and ISM is in general benign, as reported by Lim et al. in 2009. Indeed, 
patients with ISM in the USA have much the same life expectancy as the general population. However, 
in rare cases ISM may develop into more aggressive forms. The prognosis is poor for advanced SM, 
especially in elderly patients: median OS was 41 months for ASM, 24 months for SM-AHNMD, and 2 
months for MCL in the aforementioned study reported by Lim et al. 
However, although not life-threatening, both CM and ISM, being life-long conditions, are characterized 
by fluctuations of symptoms making mastocytosis a burdensome condition. This is illustrated by a 
recent study where 50-70% of patients with ISM and SSM report being impacted regarding their work 
or daily activities, or social activities (Jennings et al, 2018). Recently published results of the 
TouchStone SM Patient Survey revealed that nearly two-thirds of patients reported avoiding leaving 
their home due to SM symptoms and 66% experienced pain from symptoms that interfered with their 
ability to work, with 30% filing for medical disability due to their disease (Mesa et al, 2022).

EMA/OD/0000127063 
Page 5/9 
 
 
 
 
 
A separate 2011 study of patients with ISM found that 64% of patients had depression. The majority 
(56%) had moderate depression and 8% had severe depression (Moura et al, 2011). The analysis 
found that depression in patients with ISM did not seem to be related to physical symptoms and should 
be considered an independent symptom of disease. In addition, indolent SM is associated with a high 
rate of anaphylaxis that is often coupled with hypotension and has the potential to be fatal. 
The COMP has previously determined that the proposed condition mastocytosis is chronically 
debilitating due to symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, abdominal cramping, peptic 
ulcers and diarrhoea, and life-threatening due to bone marrow failure, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, 
and poor survival with 5-year rates of around 60% in patients. This view is retained for this type II 
variation, extension of indication procedure after the initial marketing authorisation. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposes a less than 3 in 10,000 prevalence estimate on the basis of literature and 
databases searches. This is in line with the COMP’s previous conclusion for orphan designation in 2022, 
and at the time of maintenance of the orphan designation in the context of the initial marketing 
authorisation application in 2018. 
Six data sources were identified for prevalence (Table 1): Cohen et al (2014) estimate the 14-year 
prevalence of mastocytosis to be 0.959 (0.873-0.105) per 10,000 in Denmark. A more recent study by 
Kibsgaard et al (2020) estimated ISM prevalence in Denmark to be at 1.8 cases per 10,000. In the 
Netherlands, Van Doormaal et al (2013) estimate SM prevalence to be 1.3 per 10,000. Schwaab et al 
(2020) estimated the prevalence of AdvSM to be 0.053 per 10,000 in Germany. Zanotti et al. (2021) 
estimate the prevalence of SM to be 1.22 per 10,000 in the Veneto region, and 1.72 per 10,000 in the 
Verona region of Italy. In Sweden, Ungerstedt et al (2022) estimate the prevalence of SM to be 1.06 
per 10,000 in the Stockholm region. The six studies differ in terms of the type of SM covered.  
Additional prevalence estimates were obtained from incidence data. A prevalence of 2.41 cases of CM 
per 10,000 was estimated from incidence data from Italy, including subjects of all ages (D’Inca et al, 
1996). Similarly, Danish incidence data for subjects of all ages resulted in an estimated CM prevalence 
of 6.03 per 10,000 and an overall mastocytosis prevalence of 8.84 per 10,000 (Kibsgaard et al, 2020). 
For Hungary (Marton et al, 2016), the prevalence estimated 1.67 cases of SM per 10,000. These 
calculated prevalences may be overestimates given the conservative method used for their calculation, 
as showcased previously with the examples from Kibsgaard et al (2020), Cohen et al (2014), Schwaab 
et al (2020) and Ungerstedt et al (2022). 
The sponsor argues that prevalence estimates reported in Cohen et al (2014), Kibsgaard et al (2020) 
and Van Doormaal et al (2013) are the most robust, despite two not including children or the full 
spectrum of CM. Brockow (2014) has expressed the view that Van Doormaal’s finding is comparable to 
other estimates. He states that at the consensus meeting of mastocytosis experts in Boston in 2010, a 
general cumulative prevalence of approximately 1 in 10,000 persons was estimated by other centers 
(Luis Escribano, Patrizia Bonadonna, personal communication in Brockow (2014). Valent (2013) states 
that the estimated prevalence of mastocytosis in “Middle Europe” is 0.5-1 per 10,000. These estimates 
are in line with the findings in original studies from the literature. 
Prevalence estimates found on EU databases and websites also support these estimates including 
Orphanet and RARECARENET (Orphanet, 2022; RARECARENET, 2017), and Haenisch et al (2012) 
report that for SM, data from the French mastocytosis network (Association Française pour les 
Initiatives de Recherche sur le Mastocyte et Les Mastocytoses), the Spanish mastocytosis network (Red 
Espanola de Mastocitosis), the Italian Mastocytosis Registry, and the German Competence Network on 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 6/9 
 
 
 
 
 
Mastocytosis (own unpublished results), suggest a prevalence of at least one in 364,000 in EU, which 
corresponds to a prevalence of 0.027 in 10,000.  
It is concluded that based on the available literature the reported prevalence of mastocytosis (including 
SM, CM, and their subtypes, and MCS) remains below 3 in 10,000. This is in line with recent (initial MA 
of 2022) considerations of the committee and may be considered acceptable.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Cimetidine is authorized for use in systemic mastocytosis in Portugal: profilaxia das úlceras de stress 
em doentes graves com risco de hemorragia; no tratamento de hipersecreção patológica, 
nomeadamente síndrome de Zollinger-Ellison, mastocitose sistémica e adenomas endócrinos múltiplos; 
como medida de suporte, no tratamento da hemorragia digestiva altapor úlcera péptica ou erosões (in 
English: prophylaxis of stress ulcers in critically ill patients at risk of bleeding; in the treatment of 
pathological hypersecretion, namely Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis and multiple 
endocrine adenomas; as a supportive measure in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 
peptic ulcer or erosions).  
Cimetidine has a therapeutic indication that is limited to treatment of gastric signs and symptoms of 
the disease, and this indication does not overlap with the broader target patient population covered by 
the therapeutic indication for Ayvakyt.   
Midostaurin and avapritinib are authorized centrally in Europe for mastocytosis as reflected in table 2. 
There are no specific European Guidelines in the treatment of these patients and many products are 
used off-label in the treatment of this condition. Some guidance regarding treatment algorithm is 
proposed in Pardani Am J Hematol 2019;94:363–377.  
Per the authorised indications cited above, no products have been identified that cover patients with 
CM, ISM, and SSM. The sponsor noted that as currently used best supportive care (BSC) therapies are 
not authorized for the treatment of CM, ISM and SSM patient populations, they cannot be considered 
as satisfactory methods for the purposes of Article 3(1)(b) Commission Notice 2016/C 424/03. 
In conclusion, it has been established that none of the identified products can be considered as 
satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition in question as authorized in the European 
Union.

4.  COMP position adopted on 09 November 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of mastocytosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain 
below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, 
abdominal cramping, peptic ulcers and diarrhoea, and life-threatening due to bone marrow failure, 
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and poor survival in patients with systemic mastocytosis; 
at present, no satisfactory method has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of 
the entirety of patients covered by the new therapeutic indication of Ayvakyt.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Ayvakyt, avapritinib for 
treatment of mastocytosis (EU/3/18/2074) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystinosis is a rare genetic autosomal recessive disease. It is caused by a lysosomal transport defect 
resulting in the intracellular accumulation of cystine. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Cystinosis affects approximately 0.15 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). This is equivalent to 
a total of around 7,600 people, and is below the ceiling for orphan designation, which is 5 people in 
10,000. 
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Cystine accumulates within lysosomes, forming crystal deposits in many tissues, including the kidneys 
and the eyes, but also in bone marrow, lymph nodes, intestine, spleen, liver, pancreas, gonads, thyroid, 
muscles, and in the central nervous system. In the CTNS gene responsible for coding cystinosin that 
transports cystine out of the lysosomes, more than 90 mutations and slice regions have been reported. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation  
Different CTNS gene mutations produce different phenotypes that vary based upon the amount of 
residual cystinosin. Usually, three phenotypes, based on the age of onset and severity of symptoms, are 
described. Nephropathic infantile cystinosis is the most common (95% of patients) and the most severe 
form of cystinosis with an onset around 6 to 12 months of age. It starts with the renal tubular Fanconi 
syndrome which leads to malnutrition and nutrient imbalance with growth impairment including soft, 
bowed bones, increased urination, thirst, dehydration and acidosis. If untreated, it progresses to 
end-stage renal failure at approximately 10 years of age. The intermediate form of nephropathic 
cystinosis has most of the clinical symptoms of infantile cystinosis, but appears in children aged 12-15 
years. Adult type non-nephropathic, or ocular, cystinosis is characterised only by cystine crystal deposits 
in the cornea and conjunctiva without any apparent systemic manifestations. 
Corneal cystine crystals that can be seen in the corneal epithelium and the stroma are specific 
characteristics of all three phenotypes of cystinosis. They appear as a myriad of needle-shaped highly 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 8/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reflective opacities. By 1 year of age, cystine crystals can be evidenced in the cornea by slit lamp. By 
approximately 7 years of age, the entire peripheral stroma accumulates crystals, and by approximately 
20 years of age, crystals can be seen in the entire corneal stroma.  
The crystals are initially asymptomatic but photophobia, resulting from the diffraction of light by the 
cystine crystals, is common and develops within the first few years of life. Many patients begin wearing 
sunglasses in early childhood. Superficial punctate keratopathy and pain are occasionally observed, 
mostly in patients older than 10 years of age. Other more severe complications of crystal deposits are 
corneal erosions, loss of visual contrast sensitivity, increased glare disability, decreased corneal 
sensitivity and increased corneal thickness. In very young patients, visual acuity (VA) is usually not 
affected, however, in older patients where corneal complications are more common, these may lead to 
visual impairment. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Virtually all cystinosis patients are treated by oral administration of cysteamine (Cystagon and Procysbi) 
aiming to reduce intracellular cystine accumulation, therefore delaying organ and tissue damage. While 
oral administration of cysteamine reduces intracellular cystine accumulation in non-corneal tissues, 
systemically administered cysteamine does not reach the cornea and has consequently no effect on 
corneal cystine deposits.  
To dissolve cystine crystal deposits in the cornea, the established approach is to use eye drops solutions 
containing cysteamine. Currently, eye drop formulations at concentrations between 0.10% - 1.13% are 
prepared ex tempore, e.g. by pharmacies at local hospitals. A range of different posologies, including 
hourly instillations, are applied. 
About the product 
Cystadrops contains 0.55 % mercaptamine hydrochloride (5.5 mg/ml mercaptamine hydrochloride, 
equivalent to 3.8 mg/ml mercaptamine base).  Mercaptamine is also known as cysteamine, and the two 
names are used interchangeably throughout this report. It is formulated with carboxymethylcellulose 
(CMC) to increase the residence time of the eye drops, and is to be administered 4 times per day. With 
time, the dose may be decreased to a minimum of one drop per day. The product also contains 0.01 % 
benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as a preservative. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is a complete application in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC with a known active 
substance, No. 726/2004 (Mandatory Scope) Annex 4: Orphan designated medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as an eye drops solution containing 5.5 mg/ml of mercaptamine 
hydrochloride, equivalent to 3.8 mg/ml mercaptamine, as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: benzalkonium chloride solution (BAK), carmellose sodium (CMC), citric acid 
monohydrate, disodium edetate, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water for injections.

The product is available in glass vials sealed by bromobutyl rubber and an aluminium seal. A PVC dropper 
applicator with HDPE closure is supplied with each vial and is attached to the glass vial by the patient 
before first use. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of mercaptamine hydrochloride is 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride corresponding to 
the molecular formula C2H7NS.HCl. It is also known as cysteamine hydrochloride. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 113.6 g/mol and has the following structure: 
Figure 1: Structure of Mercaptamine hydrochloride 
It is a white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and alcohol and insoluble in methylene chloride. The 
structure of mercaptamine hydrochloride has been confirmed by several techniques including elemental 
analysis, IR, MS, 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR. Mercaptamine hydrochloride has no chiral centre. Polymorphism 
is not considered relevant as mercaptamine hydrochloride is present in solution in the finished product. 
Mercaptamine hydrochloride is not the subject of a monograph in the Ph. Eur. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two alternative manufacturers are used for the manufacture of mercaptamine hydrochloride. The 
information from both manufacturers has been provided in form of Active Substance Master Files 
(ASMFs). Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in 
the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used in each case. For one of the 
manufacturers, a major objection was raised relating to the acceptability of a proposed starting material. 
A new starting material was defined and acceptable information was provided regarding the 
manufacturing process, control of ingredients, discussion of carry-over of impurities and control of 
intermediates. 
The synthetic routes have been shown to produce material of equivalent pharmaceutical quality ensuring 
similar performance in vivo. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis by manufacturers. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities for both synthetic routes were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and well characterised.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and residual 
solvents (GC). For one manufacturer, tests for sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.) and heavy metals (ICP-MS) are also 
included. The finished product manufacturer controls the drug substance according to a consolidated 
specification which is in accordance with the specifications used by the active substance manufacturers. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The methods used by the finished product manufacturer 
are the same as used by the drug substance manufacturers and have been validated by the respective 
manufacturers.  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set for both 
manufacturers/synthetic routes.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Mercaptamine hydrochloride is packaged in glass vials with rubber stoppers. Acceptable specifications for 
the vials and rubber stoppers have been provided.  
Stability data on production scale batches of active substance, stored in the intended commercial 
package, for up to 48 months under long term conditions at 5 ±3ºC and up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions, at 25ºC / 60% RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. Samples were tested for 
appearance, identity, assay, impurities and water content. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and are stability indicating. All tested parameters complied with the specifications.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable and the proposed retest periods and storage conditions are acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Cystadrops is a sterile eye drops solution to be marketed in amber glass vials containing 5 ml drug 
product. A PVC dropper applicator with HDPE closure is supplied with each vial and is attached to the glass 
vial by the patient before first use. The eye drops solution contains mercaptamine hydrochloride 5.5 
mg/ml (0.55 % w/v) corresponding to mercaptamine 3.8 mg/ml and is formulated using excipients 
described in the current Ph. Eur. The excipients are: benzalkonium chloride solution (BAK), carmellose 
sodium (CMC), citric acid monohydrate, disodium edetate, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water 
for injections. 
The drug product contains both an antioxidant, disodium edetate, and a preservative agent, 
benzalkonium chloride (BAK). These have been satisfactorily justified. It has been shown that the amount 
of BAK at shelf-life is enough to fulfil the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 Efficacy of Antimicrobial 
Preservation. The presence of BAK in the formulation is further discussed in section 2.6.1. In order to 
prolong the contact time between the cornea and the drug substance and thereby improve the efficacy of 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 11/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the drug product and reduce the number of daily instillations, a viscous formulation was chosen. The 
viscosity agent used is carmellose sodium. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 
of this report. 
The final drug product cannot be terminally sterilised by autoclaving since the drug substance is sensitive 
to high temperatures and it cannot be sterilised by aseptic filtration since the carmellose sodium makes 
the solution so viscous that it cannot pass through a 0.22 µm filter. Therefore, the manufacturing process 
for the pilot batches used in the first and second clinical studies comprised; sterilising filtration of a 
solution the drug substance and excipients,  sterilisation by autoclaving of a solution of carmellose sodium 
and excipients, then aseptic mixing of the two solutions. Following difficulties during scale up to 
production scale, another process in which carmellose sodium was sterilised by ethylene oxide (rather 
than by autoclaving) was initially proposed.  
The CHMP raised major objections to this choice of ethylene oxide sterilisation process and, having failed 
ensure sterility by this process, the applicant reverted to the original process used for pilot scale batches 
and clinical batches, i.e. sterilisation of the carmellose sodium solution by autoclaving. The change in 
sterilization method for carmellose sodium required some adjustments in the composition, manufacturing 
process, in-process controls and drug product specification. The manufacturer performed complementary 
process validation activities to validate the manufacturing process steps while increasing the batch size. 
All changes were well described and justified and the final process is now more consistent with the one 
used for the clinical batches.  
The final formulation and viscosity are similar in the clinical batches and the product proposed for 
marketing.  A specification limit for viscosity was set based on the variability in the historical batches.The 
minimum effective drop size has been defined and shown to be consistently achieved. The solution is 
buffered and the basis for setting of the pH/buffer capacity of the solution has been adequately justified. 
It was considered possible that the low buffered pH and viscosity of the formulation are contributing 
factors to ocular irritation and inflammation. However, this has to be weighed against the benefits of a 
stable substance that stays at the eye for a longer time and allows longer intervals between the 
administration times (i.e. 4 times a day during waking hours compared to current situation; 
mercaptamine eye drop formulations prepared ex tempore, e.g. by pharmacies at local hospitals, which 
have a range of different posologies, including hourly instillations). 
The primary packaging of the drug product is amber glass vials. Each vial is closed by a bromobutyl 
siliconised stopper and sealed with a flip off/tear off aluminium vial seal. Additionally, an individually 
packed PVC dropper applicator with HDPE closure is supplied with each vial and is attached to the glass 
vial by the patient before first use. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The vials, 
rubber stoppers and dropper applicators are sterilised before use and validation data for the sterilisation 
process has been provided where relevant. The performed usability test revealed some patients had 
difficulties when removing the closure and attaching the dropper applicator. This lead to a revision of the 
instructions for use in the package leaflet. Several subjects also had negative perception of usability of the 
container. Moreover, the process of opening the vial and attaching the dropper by patients, which has 
been shown to be difficult, could lead to microbiological and particulate contamination of the product. 
Difficulties in dispensing drops from the assembled vial/dropper were also reported. Inspection of product 
samples showed that container is not considered optimal in view of usability and assuring the 
microbiological quality of the drug product in-use. The CHMP concluded that the container closure system 
is not optimal, but considering the overall benefit/risk of the product, it could be used whilst awaiting the 
development of a new container closure system, preferably a plastic bottle with an integrated dropper

applicator already attached. The applicant has initiated a development plan for post approval 
development of a new container aiming for development of ready-to-use plastic bottles (with dropper 
already in place). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The non-standard manufacturing process consists of four main steps: preparation of the buffer solution, 
mixing of carmellose sodium into a portion of the buffer solution to produce a gel followed by autoclaving, 
dissolution of the active substance and other excipients in the remaining buffer solution followed by sterile 
filtration, and mixing of the two solutions followed by clarifying filtration through a 40 µm filter.  
The critical steps in the manufacturing process have been identified. In-process controls have been 
satisfactorily described and appropriate acceptance criteria are laid down. Bioburden is measured on the 
gel and active substance solutions prior to sterilisation. Sterility of the gel is tested as per Ph. Eur. before 
it is combined with the active substance solution. A clarifying filtration through a 40 µm filter is then 
performed before the product is filled into vials. The filters used have been acceptably described and 
validated. 
Since the drug substance is sensitive to oxidation, the filling in glass vials is performed under nitrogen 
bubbling.  
Process validation has been performed on three commercial scale batches. All results were acceptable 
and the process was shown to be robust and reproducible. No unit showed microbiological growth in the 
media fill tests on three batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance 
(visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), identification (mercaptamine 
hydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride and disodium edetate) (HPLC / UV), assay (mercaptamine 
hydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride and disodium edetate) (HPLC / UV), impurities (HPLC / UV), 
efficacy of antimicrobial preservation (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
The in-use specifications include appearance, pH, viscosity, osmolality, assay (mercaptamine 
hydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride and disodium edetate) and impurities.  
The proposed specifications limits have been appropriately justified and are acceptable. The proposed 
limit for total impurities was accepted based on results for clinical batches and the limits for cystamine 
and any other impurity. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data has been provided for three commercial scale batches manufactured according to the 
new process. All tests in the release specification were carried out and all results were within the 
specification limits.  
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 13/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability of the product 
Three months stability data has been provided for three commercial scale batches manufactured 
according to the new process and stored under long term conditions at 5ºC and under accelerated 
conditions at 25ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines.  
All tests in the shelf-life specification were performed. The results were within the specification limits and 
in line with the batch analysis data except for the specified impurity, cystamine, where an increasing 
trend was seen.  
Supporting data was provided for batches where carmellose sodium was sterilized by ethylene oxide and 
the manufacturing process and formulation were somewhat different and from clinical batches with the 
same composition and sterilisation method as for the commercial batches. 
An in-use stability study was performed on two of the batches manufactured according to the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process. The level of cystamine impurity was higher than the limits in the 
release and shelf-life specifications and so a separate in-use shelf life specification with wider limits for 
cystamine content has been accepted. Every day for 7 consecutive days, two drops were sampled from 
each bottle four times a day. All results obtained after 7 days’ use comply with the specifications 
regardless of in-use conditions (room temperature, refrigerator or mixed room temperature/ 
refrigerator). It was shown to be important (e.g. with respect to viscosity) for the correct use of the 
product that it is administered at room temperature. Accordingly, the SmPC includes an instruction for the 
patient to bring Cystadrops to room temperature before the first administration. When discussing the 
in-use stability of the product, the CHMP considered that requiring storage at 2-8°C during the in-use 
period and requiring a patient to bring the product back to room temperature before each administration 
of the product would not be ideal in terms of usability and patient compliance. For that reason, the CHMP 
preference was for an in-use period with storage at room temperature.  
Based on the overall provided data, and following discussion of the issues outlined above, the CHMP 
concluded that the shelf-life of the unopened vial should be limited to 6 months when stored at 2-8°C and 
that an in-use shelf-life of 7 days after opening, when stored at or below 25°C, was acceptable. 
In order to provide assurance of appropriate in-use quality of the product, the in-use stability of batches 
that are currently on long term stability should be investigated at the 6 month and subsequent test 
intervals. Before a longer shelf-life can be accepted, new in use stability data should be provided at that 
latest time point. 
Adventitious agents  
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The active substance is manufactured by two different suppliers. The major objection that was raised 
requesting a redefinition of the starting material for active substance manufactured one of the suppliers 
was solved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 14/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initially, a major objection was raised during the procedure regarding the usability of the container 
closure system but it was subsequently decided, in view of the clarifications introduced in the Product 
Information and the improved usability of this product compared to current clinical practice 
(mercaptamine eye drop formulations prepared ex tempore, e.g. by pharmacies at local hospitals), that 
the proposed container can be approved. In addition, the applicant has undertaken to develop an 
alternative more user friendly container, preferably a plastic bottle with an integrated dropper applicator. 
The finished product is sterilised partly by aseptic filtration and partly by autoclaving (carmellose sodium 
solution in buffer). The applicant first proposed to use ethylene oxide sterilisation of carmellose sodium 
for commercial batches but after a major objection was raised that sterility had not been acceptably 
proven, the applicant changed to autoclaving of the carmellose sodium solution and the major objection 
was solved.  
The formulation has not been optimised for viscosity in relation to tolerability and dose delivery. It is 
possible that the low buffered pH and viscosity of the formulation are contributing factors to ocular 
irritation and inflammation. However, this has to be weighed against the benefits of a stable substance 
that stays at the eye for a longer time and allows longer intervals between the administration times (i.e. 
4 times a day during waking hours compared to current situation; mercaptamine eye drop formulations 
prepared ex tempore, e.g. by pharmacies at local hospitals, which have a range of different posologies, 
including hourly instillations). The benefit of improved usability and patient compliance associated with 
easier and reduced dosing schedule was considered to outweigh the risk of potential irritation. Based on 
the available stability data, only six months’ shelf-life for the unopened container stored at 2-8°C is 
supported at present, with a 7 day in-use shelf life when stored at or below 25°C. Before this shelf-life can 
be extended, more in-use stability data must be provided. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. The application is 
recommended for approval from a pharmaceutical point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should develop an alternative, more user-friendly container closure system, 
preferably a plastic bottle with an integrated dropper applicator. 
2.  The stability programme with the current container closure system should continue as planned 
and in-use stability studies should be carried out for the drug product at each intermediate time 
points as they are reached (i.e. at 6, 12 and 18 months).  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical dossier was primarily comprised of published literature. The Applicant has provided an 
overview of data available for oral and topical formulations of mercaptamine. In support of the ocular 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
route of administration, ocular pharmacology, absorption and ocular tolerance studies were also 
conducted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics of cysteamine was explored in in vitro and in vivo studies. Free 
cysteamine is able to enter lysosomes and to participate with cystine in a disulfide interchange reaction to 
form cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide. These two compounds can exit the cystinotic 
lysosome by using transporters other than the defective cystinosin. 
A study to support the clinical efficacy of the Cystadrops 0.55 %, eye drops formulation was conducted in 
Ctns-/- mice. No clear benefit could be shown following three months of three times daily instillations. 
When the frequency of instillations was increased to 6 times daily a possible effect (reduction of 
time-dependent increase in number of cysteine crystals) was observed.  
In the literature, it has been reported that a treatment regimen of 4 ocular drops/day with a 0.55% 
cysteamine solution for 1 month in 5 months old Ctns-/- mice showed a clear effect of cysteamine 
treatment. These data indicates that cysteamine drops could have an effect on the corneal cysteine 
crystals deposits in cystinosis.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
It is well established that cysteamine has several other pharmacological/biological effects distinct from its 
intralysosomal cystine depleting activity. The most important effects can be ascribed to its a) antioxidant 
effect occurring as a result of increased intracellular glutathione levels b) inhibition of transglutaminase 2 
and c) depletion of tissue somatostatin and prolactin. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No studies were conducted as Cystadrops is a locally acting product.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were conducted, as systemic exposure from the applied eye drops is expected to be very low. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
From published studies in rats and mice, orally administered cysteamine appears to be rapidly absorbed, 
and is eliminated rapidly from plasma and tissue. Ocular administration of cysteamine is unlikely to result 
in noteworthy systemic exposure.  
A series of studies were performed in order to choose the optimal formulation of Cystadrops. Cysteamine 
could be assayed in the cornea up to 3 hours post administration in the presence of N acetyl cysteine. The 
elimination half-life of cysteamine from the ocular tissue appeared to be in the range of 1 hour. Overall, 
the best formulation seemed to be the 0.55% cysteamine/CMC medium viscosity formulation.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The ocular tolerance of the clinical and commercial Cystadrops formulations have been characterized in 
one pivotal GLP-compliant study, one non-GLP full study and in one non-GLP pilot study. In addition, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 16/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Applicant performed a literature search covering the period up to the year 2013. No other new toxicity 
studies were submitted.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
General toxicity studies via ocular administration with cysteamine were not conducted as this is locally 
acting product. 
Genotoxicity 
Cysteamine is not considered to be genotoxic, as shown by the results of Ames test and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
Cystadrops is intended to treat the local ocular symptoms only. Systemic effects from ocularly 
administered cysteamine are considered negligible in patients with concomitant oral exposure when 
considering that the proposed daily clinical ocular dose (1 drop up to 4 times daily in each eye) is 
1000-fold lower than the highest recommended daily oral dose of the approved Cystagon hard capsules. 
Carcinogenicity studies using ocular administration are not considered feasible. Therefore, the lack of 
carcinogenicity studies is accepted.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The observed reduced female fertility in rats at the high dose as reported in literature is not considered 
relevant for ocular administration of Cystadrops since the systemic exposure is anticipated to be low. 
Similarly, the observed developmental toxicity and teratogenic effects in rats with NOAEL at 75 
mg/kg/day following oral administration are not considered relevant for ocular administration.  
Local Tolerance  
Cystadrops administered three times a day during three months to rabbits was macroscopically and 
microscopically well tolerated. When administered six times a day during three months, the treatment 
was less well tolerated and was not tolerated when it was administered nine times a day during two 
weeks. For the animals treated nine times a day, food and water consumption were decreased. On ocular 
examination moderate to severe conjunctival redness, slight to moderate conjunctival chemosis, slight to 
moderate cornea opacity, slight to severe conjunctival congestion and cornea vascularisation were 
observed along with pathological findings on conjunctivae, cornea epithelium, cornea stroma and eyelids.  
In the study bridging the Cystadrops formulation used in clinical trials with the formulation to be 
marketed, the findings were similar in animals treated with the two different formulations. The 
formulation itself induces very slight conjunctival and corneal changes that appear to regress over time. 
No clear difference in ocular tolerance was seen between Cystadrops itself and the vehicle. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Mercaptamine is a natural substance and the use of Cystadrops will not alter its concentration or 
distribution in the environment. Therefore, Cystadrops is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
While presented ocular pharmacology study does not show conclusive efficacy, the rationale for 
development of Cystadrops for the treatment of ocular manifestations of cystinosis is appropriate.  It is 
unclear which instillation frequency of the Cystadrops formulation is optimal, or if the Cystadrops 
formulation is equally effective as other cysteamine formulations. However, the evaluation of clinical 
efficacy and dosage regimen is based on the available clinical data. 
No further information has been provided relating to the disposition of cysteamine after ocular 
administration, and it is considered that additional valuable data relating to the ocular (and potential 
systemic) distribution/elimination of cysteamine could have been generated in the rabbit 
pharmacokinetic studies. However, the absence of these data is considered acceptable. 
The lack of safety pharmacology studies for this ocular formulation is accepted based on the low 
anticipated systemic exposure of cysteamine. The lack of non-clinical drug-drug interaction studies is 
accepted. 
The main cysteamine-related toxicity reported in published safety pharmacology and toxicology studies 
were effects on the CNS and GI, as well as on reproductive and developmental systems. While existing 
non-clinical cysteamine toxicity data cannot be considered to be complete, clinical safety has been 
established through long-term oral use in patients with cystinosis.  
In general, the ocular repeated dose toxicity of cysteamine should have been evaluated in at least one 
species for at least six months in order to support chronic ocular use. However, no ocular repeated dose 
toxicity study has been submitted. This was justified by claiming that different cysteamine formulations 
have been extensively used in cystinosis patients. With reference to the submitted clinical data, the lack 
of further non-clinical data was accepted. 
Cysteamine in its commercial formulation elucidated ocular irritation and inflammation in rabbits, 
primarily consisting of slight conjunctival redness, congestion and chemosis. Corresponding effects were 
also observed in the clinic where a high incidence of generally transient reactions like stinging, blurring, 
irritation, itching, redness was reported in association with instillation of the eye drops. It is not

considered likely that generation of new in vivo non-clinical data will add further reassurance relating to 
the ocular tolerance of Cystadrops. As the proposed clinical safety measures are considered adequate to 
address the tolerability concerns, it is considered that no further non-clinical data are required. 
The excipients used in the Cystadrops drug product have well-established use in ocular formulations, and 
are considered acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered by the CHMP sufficient to support the application for a 
marketing authorisation for Cystadrops in the treatment of corneal crystals in cystinosis. The CHMP 
furthermore concluded that Cystadrops was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Patients with the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, cystinosis, lack a functional cystine 
carrier, resulting in intracellular accumulation of cystine. Cysteamine is an amino thiol that converts 
cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulphide, both of which can pass through the 
lysosomal membrane without a functional carrier and then eliminated from the cells. 
Due to the lack of corneal vascularisation, systemic administration of cysteamine has no therapeutic 
effect on corneal cystine crystals and local treatment is needed. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No studies were performed.  
The absence of corneal cystine crystals deposits in healthy subjects does not allow the performance of a 
pharmacodynamic study in this population. In in vitro experiments, a rapid reduction in intra-lysosomal 
cystine levels of 90 – 95% has been shown in cultured fibroblasts and peripheral leukocytes (Thoene et al, 
1976) and corneal stromal cells (Kaiser-Kupfer et al, 1987) for concentrations of cysteamine > 0.1 mM. 
This is approximately 50-fold less than the concentration of cysteamine contained in Cystadrops.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. The vast majority of patients with cystinosis has 
systemic manifestations of the disease and are already treated with oral cysteamine in the range of 1 
(small children) to 2 grams (older children and adults) per day. This is to be compared with the 
approximately 2 mg/day administered by the ocular route. Thus, the additive systemic exposure is 
expected to be negligible and the absence of pharmacokinetic studies was accepted by the CHMP. There 
is also no concern in special populations including subjects with hepatic or renal impairment or in the 
elderly.  
From the non-clinical data, it was shown that cysteamine resided in rabbit corneal tissue up to one hour 
after administration of a single dose of 0.55% cysteamine solution including CMC, albeit at lower 
concentrations that used in the clinical formulations. Even though the rabbit cornea may not be fully 
relevant (no cystine deposits, lower blinking frequency) it is acknowledged that corneal absorption and 
residence time cannot be evaluated in patients.  
No pharmacodynamic studies have been performed and none are requested as the mechanism of action 
of cysteamine is well characterised. The addition of cysteamine eye drops on top of oral 
cysteamine-treatment is further not likely to give a relevant contribution to a risk for systemic secondary 
pharmacological effects or systemic pharmacodynamic interactions. With regards to the potential for 
local, ocular interactions, the recommendation in the SmPC to allow 10 minutes between administrations 
of different eye drops is considered acceptable.  
More than 90 mutations of the CTNS gene have been reported which produce different phenotypes. All but 
one patient in the two conducted studies were diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis which is 
the most common (95%) form with the most rapid progression rate. Although recognising the need for 
topical treatment once cystine accumulates in the cornea, a less frequent dosing may be sufficient in the 
more slowly progressing forms. Due to the rarity of the disease, the difficulties in evaluating this are 
however acknowledged. In any case, during the course of study OCT-1 (see below), the dosing frequency 
was reduced in all patients and one out of the eight included subjects maintained the reduction in crystals 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 20/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with one instillation per day throughout the 5-year study period. The potential to decrease the dosing 
frequency based on treatment response as proposed in the SmPC is therefore a pragmatic approach 
which is considered reasonable.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the view that the available information from the scientific literature were sufficient to 
support the application for Cystadrops in the treatment of corneal crystals in cystinosis from a clinical 
pharmacology perspective. Given the local route of administration and that no significant systemic 
exposure is expected, the CHMP considered that the lack of specific pharmacodynamics or 
pharmacokinetic studies was acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study OCT-1: Adaptive dose regimen of Cystadrops for cOrneal Crystal deposiTs and ocular 
manifestations in nephropathic cystinosis  
Methods 
The study was an open-label non-randomised phase I-IIa study to evaluate dose-response and safety 
over a period of 5 years.  
Figure 2: Study schematics 
The study included subjects from 3 years of age with confirmed cystinosis with corneal deposits. 
After the 30 day run-in period on their previous treatment (cysteamine eye drops 0.10%, 3-6 times/day), 
subjects received Cystadrops at the same frequency as with the 0.10% formulation (range 3-6 times/day, 
median 4 times/day. The number of daily eye drops was increased (only in case of a previous reduction 
of the number of daily instillations), remained stable or decreased based on worsening, no change or 
improvement in the amount of crystal deposits. The decision to adapt the dose regimen was taken by the 
ophthalmologist. The criterion for worsening or improvement was based on his subjective evaluation 
following the results of all ophthalmic examinations performed during the visit. Two formulations were 
tested, one with 4.10% (up to 15 September 2009) and one with 5.20 % CMC. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in total score of the corneal cystine crystal density 
measured by IVCM using the Rostock Cornea Module of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT/RCM) in 
the central cornea (7 corneal layers i.e. 2 layers in the epithelium, Bowman’s membrane, superficial, 
medium and deep stroma and the endothelium) at each visit up to Month 60 of study treatments. Both 
eyes were analysed. IVCM images, 5-10 per corneal layer, were evaluated and scored in an open fashion. 
A single score was established for each layer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 21/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crystal density was rated on a 0-4 point scale from no (score 0) to 75-100% of deposits in the image 
(score 4) in each of 7 corneal layers, i.e. the maximal total score was 28. 
Secondary ocular imaging endpoints: Crystal thickness (in µm and as percentage of corneal thickness) 
assessed by HRT in the central corneal region and by optical coherence tomography (OCT, with software 
for analysis of the anterior segment). The corneal cystine crystal score (CCCS) was assessed by slit-lamp 
and (score 0.00 to 3.00). 
Secondary ocular clinical criteria: Photophobia (slit-lamp for each eye individually with a gradual increase 
in the light intensity, rated by investigator, 0 -5 point scale), visual acuity (VA, logMAR scale), and 
contrast sensitivity (Galinet chart, LogMar scores) 
Statistical methods and analysis populations: 
This was an open study and all patients received treatment in both eyes.  
A realistic sample size for this study was defined as 8 nephropathic cystinosis patients, taking the rarity 
of the disease and the pilot status of the study into account. 
Descriptive statistics were used for all demographic, safety and efficacy endpoints. As the IVCM score is 
calculated for each eye, the reference unit for the analysis was the eye. Model-based analysis using 
Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to take into account the correlation between eyes. 
Inferential tests were applied to compare the absolute change from baseline (Day 1) for the IVCM total 
score, as response to Cystadrops treatment. 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all patients/eyes who received at least one dose of Cystadrops and 
who have a baseline assessment and at least one ocular measurement post-dose. Due to the limited 
number of subjects, no per protocol set (PPS) was defined. 
Rules for imputation of missing data were developed prior to database lock and were detailed in the SAP. 
The SAP was dated 13 February 2014. 
Conduct 
The study recruited 8 patients from 2 centres in France and was conducted between February 2008 and 
April 2013.  
The study was initially planned as a 6 months study (Feb 2008). The study was amended 5 times and 
prolonged 4 times, finally to 60 months. The algorithm for treatment adaptation was included in July 
2008.  
Of the 8 patients (16 eyes), all completed day 180 and all completed the 5-year study. Compliance based 
on patient diary card recordings ranged from 98% to 100%. 
Results 
All included patients were diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis. The patient population 
included 1 adult, 3 paediatric subjects aged 12-17 and 4 aged 7-12 years, with a mean disease duration 
of 10.6 (±4.2) years. All subjects received concomitant systemic treatment for nephropathic cystinosis. 
The mean baseline IVCM corneal crystal score was 11.4 (±2.9), photophobia was 2.5 (±0.9) while VA was 
close to normal. 
Following the run-in period, subjects received a median of 4 instillations/eye/day (range 3-5). At Day 30, 
the number of instillations was decreased by one for 1 patient. At Day 90, the prescribed number of 
instillations was decreased by 1 for all patients (median 3 instillations/eye/day, range 2-4). After Day 90, 
one subject maintained the reduction in corneal crystals with one instillation per day.

Crystal deposits were also evaluated by corneal layer. The largest reduction of deposits was observed in 
the stromal layers which gives indirect evidence of a penetration of cysteamine through the corneal 
epithelium. VA and contrast sensitivity remained fairly stable over time. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study CHOC: Cysteamine Hydrochloride for nephrOpathic Cystinosis 
Methods 
This was an open-label (scoring of primary efficacy masked), randomised, 3 month superiority trial 
comparing Cystadrops and cysteamine HCl eye drops solution 0.10% (CH 0.10 %).  
Figure 4: Schematics of main study CHOC. 
Study Participants  
The study included subjects diagnosed with cystinosis based on white blood cells cystine concentration (> 
1.5 nmoles half-cystine/mg protein) and presence of corneal crystal deposits. Subjects less than 2 years 
of age were excluded as conduct of confocal microscopy may not be feasible in this population. Other 
exclusion criteria included uncontrolled hepatic, cardiovascular or neurologic disease, cancer, pregnancy 
or breastfeeding.

Treatments 
Cystadrops and the comparator (CH 0.10%), were both administered 4x/day to each eye for the duration 
of the study. The comparator was the standard of care used in France at the time of study. The 
formulation of Cystadrops in this study contained 5.20 % CMC. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Cystadrops vs. CH 0.10% in terms of superiority in 
patients with nephropathic cystinosis. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety profile of 
Cystadrops in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in IVCM total score (crystal density) at day 90 compared to 
baseline, see study OCT-1 above. As in OCT-1, scores for 7 layers of the central cornea are summarised 
(score 0-4 for each layer). In this study, at each site visit, approximately 200 IVCM images of all layers 
are acquired in the central cornea of each eye. 
Secondary endpoints were photophobia, crystal thickness and CCCS. In children which could not undergo 
evaluation with IVCM (not included in the primary analysis), the secondary endpoints were to be 
analysed. Exploratory analyses were to be repeated for each subgroup: children (< 18 years) and adults 
(≥ 18years). 
VA and contrast sensitivity were included among the safety endpoints but presented among the efficacy 
endpoints below. 
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the change in IVCM total score in study OCT-1 and based on the following 
assumptions: no changes in the CH 0.10% treatment group, a mean reduction of 3.0 points in the 
Cystadrops treatment group and an SD of 2.0. With a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90% taking a 
drop out of 10% into account, the sample size was estimated to 12 patients per treatment arm. 
Randomisation 
The unit of randomisation was the patient and the unit of analysis was the eye. Randomisation was 
stratified according to IVCM status (done /not done) and age class (≤11, 12-17, ≥18). 
Masking 
Patients were not masked to treatment due to the different viscosities of the formulations. Physicians and 
the study coordinators were not masked to the patient’s treatment allocation while scoring of IVCM 
images was made by an independent masked reader.  
Statistical methods 
A GEE model was applied for the primary endpoint with treatment arm as effect and IVCM total score at 
baseline as covariate. The structure of the variance-covariance matrix for the primary efficacy analysis 
was autoregressive. A parametric Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse the change at 
Day 90 from baseline for the secondary efficacy criteria. The correlation between paired eyes was taken 
into account as repeated measurements within the subject in the model. 
Three analysis populations were defined in this study, the Safety Set (SS) and the FAS including all 
patients/eyes who received at least one dose of a study product and the PPS including all patients/eyes of 
the FAS who did not meet any major protocol deviations which may affect efficacy assessments. 
Rules for imputation of missing data were developed prior to database lock and were detailed in the SAP. 
No interim analysis was planned and none was performed.

Recruitment 
Over a period of less than 6 months (09 January 2013 to 28 June 2013), 32 subjects were included in 2 
French centres.  
Conduct of the study 
No significant protocol amendments were made. The protocol version used during the study was dated 20 
December 2012. The majority of protocol deviations were related to compliance to treatment. 
Numbers analysed 
One patient (CH 0.10% arm) was reported as lost to follow-up after randomisation. The remaining 31 
patients completed the study. The mean duration of treatment was 89.6 ± 14.5 days, and the mean 
number of days on treatment was 85.5±14.5. The mean number of daily instillations was 3.5 and 4.1 in 
the Cystadrops and CHOC treatment arm, respectively. 
Baseline data 
All included patients were diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis except for one adult patient in 
the Cystadrops arm who was diagnosed with late-onset nephropathic cystinosis. All but this subject and 
one additional subject on dialysis after rejection of 2 renal transplants were treated with systemic 
cysteamine treatment at inclusion. All subjects were treated with topical cysteamine (CH 0.10%) at 
inclusion and all were co-treated with topical ocular treatments e.g. dry-eye treatments, anti-infectives or 
anti-inflammatory treatment.

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of primary efficacy 
Analysis of IVCM scores that included all eyes with complete IVCM baseline data imputing missing day 90 
IVCM data by using the LOCF approach (day 30 scores, or if not available baseline IVCM scores) 
demonstrated that the same magnitude of reduction in corneal crystals in the Cystadrops treatment arm 
(-4.60) and a minimally increased improvement in the CH 0.1% treatment arm (from -0.46 to -0.63) 
compared to the primary analysis in the FAS was observed. Consistency was also observed in the PP 
population. For both, statistical significance remained. Sensitivity analyses including eyes were IVCM 
scores were missing in some corneal layers were also consistent with the primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses in the adult and paediatric populations 
At day 90, the relative reduction in the IVCM total score vs. baseline was 44 and 36% for Cystadrops in 
the adult and the paediatric population, respectively. In the CH 0.10% treatment group, the 
corresponding changes were 2 and 0.15%. In adults, the difference in absolute change in IVCM total score 
between the 2 treatment arms (control minus Cystadrops) at Day 90 was estimated to be 5.09 (95% CI, 
2.76, 7.42). A difference of similar magnitude was observed in the paediatric population but the GEE 
model did not converge. 
With regards to CCCS and Crystal thickness, an outcome in favour of Cystadrops was observed in both 
adults and paediatric patients. For CCCS he mean changes in CCCS were, in the Cystadrops and CH 
0.10% arms respectively, -0.59 ± 0.55 and 0.04 ± 0.20 in the paediatric eye population (p = 0.0201) 
and -0.59 ± 0.52 and 0.25 ± 0.28 in the adult eye population (p = 0.0254).

In addition, five clinical trials have been conducted by Sigma-Tau for the development of a cysteamine 
topical eye drops formulation containing an ingredients’ composition close to Cystadrops, especially in 
terms of active substance concentration. Together, they mention 63 subjects whereof 42 have been 
treated with cysteamine eye drops at a concentration of 0.5 %, although the available data was limited. 
These studies are the following: 
  Study 86-EI-0062A in which 2 patients were treated with 0.1% cysteamine. There was a positive 
effect of cysteamine eye drops, which was very well tolerated. 
  Study 86-EI-0006213-1 in which 19 patients in a double masked controlled trial were treated with 
0.1% cysteamine. In terms of efficacy there was a 1.0 unit decrease in CCCS or failure to have a 
1.0 unit increase when the baseline score was less than 1.0 CCCS. This resulted in no statistical 
difference (P=0.13) between treated and placebo eye. As to safety, three patients reported 
itching and irritation in both placebo and treated eye. 
  Study 86-EI-00662B-2: In this double blind study 8 patients were treated with the current 0.5% 
strength Cysteamine. From an efficacy standpoint there was a 1.0 unit decrease in CCCS which 
resulted in a statistical difference (P=0.013) between treated and placebo eye. Seventeen (17)

patients reported AE's with the two groups (pain and redness were the most common AE's). The 
rate of AE's was equal between the two groups. There was no report of photophobia or corneal 
erosions. 
  Study 92-EI-0230: In this double masked study 20 patients received either 0.5% cysteamine or 
0.5% cysteamine with Benzalkonium (preservative). Both regimes were equally effective in 
preventing crystal formation in the one year follow-up period (patients had little crystal formation 
CCCS <1.0) One AE was reported occurring in both eyes (stinging and burning).  
  Study 94-EI-0016: In this double masked study 14 patients received either 0.5% cysteamine or 
0.5% cystamine. The study was stopped by the DATA Safety review board based on the planned 
preliminary analysis indicating no efficacy with cystamine. Three patients reported AE's and the 
most common were burning redness occurring in both treatments. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two studies, both conducted in France, form the basis for the clinical development programme. The 
studies recruited adult and paediatric subjects with almost exclusively nephropathic cystinosis with 
corneal cystine crystal deposits, i.e. subjects overall corresponding to the targeted indication.  
The choice of comparator in the pivotal trial, a standard of care formulation of cysteamine (CH 0.10%) 
used in France, and the superiority design is overall endorsed. Due to the difficulties procuring a suitable 
0.55 % cysteamine eye drop comparator, no third treatment arm was included which is unfortunate since 
a comparison of efficacy and tolerability with a non-viscous 0.55% formulation would have been of value. 
In view of the rarity of the condition, the overall clinical programme is considered reasonable. However, 
with regards to the pivotal CHOC study, the CHMP recommended that subjects should be treated for at 
least 6 months to demonstrate a sustained response to treatment. Even though study OCT-1 was 5 years 
in duration, only 8 subjects were included. To address the concern relating to the absence of longer-term 
data which was of major concern, the Applicant has provided further support for sustained efficacy and 
long-term safety the NPU programme, which was found reassuring.  
One critical issue identified by the CHMP was that the product proposed for marketing was not tested in 
the clinical setting. For marketing, the concentration of the viscosity enhancing excipient CMC in 
Cystadrops was intended to be 2.43%. In the major part of the pilot and in the pivotal studies, the 
concentration of CMC in Cystadrops was 5.20%. However, by changing the method for sterilisation (see 
Quality), the now to be marketed formulation is very similar to that used in the clinical trial with the 
concentration of CMC being back to 5.2%. The CHMP concern was thus addressed. 
The open-label design of OCT-1 where the patient was his/her own control in determining the lowest 
effective dose was acceptable for an initial study with focus on safety. The study involved patients who 
were responders to CH 0.10% on a regimen between 3-6 drops/eye/day and the dose adjustment was 
based on the clinical response. Although a mean regimen of 3 instillations/eye/day was reached with 
Cystadrops treatment, a decision was nevertheless made to use a regimen of 4 instillations/eye/day in 
the pivotal CHOC Study as this was the mean dosing frequency during the three initial months of OCT-1.  
Both studies were open-label. In CHOC the evaluation of primary efficacy (i.e. scoring of images) was 
made by a masked, independent evaluator, however images for scoring were selected by a non-masked 
ophthalmologist immediately after the reading to select good-quality and representative images. There is 
thus a potential for a selection bias and leaves the study without any truly masked evaluations, which 
adds uncertainty to the magnitude of the effect size. While recognised that the different viscosities of 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 35/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cystadrops and CH 0.1% would hamper patient masking, it is unfortunate that attempts to mask the 
evaluating physician (secondary efficacy and safety) were not made in CHOC and consequently, the 
subjective assessments will be less robust. 
In both studies, the primary endpoint “the absolute change in total score of the corneal cystine crystal 
density measured by IVCM” is considered acceptable and was previously agreed by the CHMP in the 
scientific advice as the main clinical endpoint, photophobia is prone to subjectivity.  
Crystal scores from 7 corneal layers of different thickness (10 µm to close to 500 µm) were summarised, 
but the rationale for giving equal weight to the layers was not clear. The Applicant referred to a published 
methodology and has also presented re-calculated the ICVM outcomes weighing each corneal layer 
according to the relative thickness of each layer. The weighted IVCM total scores were higher than the 
un-weighted ICVM total scores, but importantly, the two curves of IVCM total scores are parallel over 
time. Consequently, the non-weighed evaluation does not affect the overall outcome. At each visit in 
OCT-1, 5-10 IVCM images were acquired from each corneal layer. In study CHOC, almost 30 rather than 
5-10 images were captured for each layer. The Applicant has explained that a large number of images 
were captured to obtain 5-10 good quality pictures for reading. However, these images were selected by 
the physician that was unmasked to the patient’s treatment assignment, resulting in a potential for a 
selection bias. However, corneal crystals were also evaluated with OCT and slit lamp. Since the outcome 
obtained with the IVCM was consistent with the secondary evaluations of corneal crystals, this issue is not 
considered major. 
The evaluation with IVCM was not feasible in all patients, notably in the youngest paediatric subset and it 
was pre-specified that efficacy in these subjects will be evaluated outside the primary IVCM efficacy 
population through the secondary efficacy analyses. This was endorsed by the CHMP. 
The evaluation of corneal crystals was complemented with evaluations of the key clinical endpoint in 
corneal cystinosis, photophobia.  In addition, VA and contrast sensitivity have been evaluated which is 
considered adequate although in CHOC these evaluations were presented only in the safety section. 
These evaluations are considered of relevance for the understanding of the patient benefit. Even though 
photophobia is the main clinical manifestation, with progression of the disease, VA becomes generally 
impaired and if vision is negatively affected by the crystals, a reduction in these would logically lead to an 
improvement in VA. Similarly, as contrast sensitivity could be affected by glare, a reduction in corneal 
crystals may have a positive effect on contrast sensitivity as well although this relation seems not fully 
investigated.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bearing in mind the rarity of the disease and that only 2 centres participated in the CHOC study, the 
inclusion and follow-up of 32 subjects within less than 6 months appeared relatively rapid. This has been 
attributed to the fact that French cystinosis patients are well informed and that physicians involved in 
OCT-1 were asked to accelerate the recruitment to CHOC. This resulted in a rapid enrolment of all but the 
last few patients.  
In cystinosis, phenotypic severity varies according to mutations within the CTNS genes and adequate 
reassurance has been provided that the condition can be considered genotypically and phenotypically 
homogeneous across Europe. Therefore, the data generated within a French cohort can be considered to 
be applicable to the wider geographical patient population. 
The studies recruited a limited but adequate patient population with 8 subjects in OCT-1 and 32 subjects 
in CHOC. It is recognised that it would be difficult to conduct a placebo-controlled study with the CH 
0.10 % formulation available and that this formulation was suitable to provide assay sensitivity in CHOC. 
However, from OCT-1, it remains unclear whether the patients were unusual in their response since 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 36/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects remained stable on 3-5 daily instillations of CH 0.1 % during the 30 day run-in phase although 
CH 0.1 %is frequently recommended to use hourly during waking hours. It is on the other hand 
acknowledged that no improvement was observed during the run-in period and also that OCT-1 was an 
exploratory study.  
In CHOC, 4 subjects in each treatment arm had no photophobia at baseline. The overall baseline VA 
indicated a mild vision loss, although somewhat worse compared to study OCT-01 and a few subjects 
presented with 1.0 LogMar (i.e. 0.1) at least in one eye.  
In OCT-1, the IVCM total score (primary endpoint) was reduced with an average of 30%, however, the 
variability was high. After 90 days on treatment, no further reduction was observed. The reduction in 
crystal deposits was maintained with a mean decrease from 4 to 3 instillations of Cystadrops per day. In 
CHOC, the corresponding reduction after 3 months was 40% in the Cystadrops treatment arm without 
any change in the comparator arm. The reduction from baseline was clearly significant (p<0.0001) and 
supported by sensitivity analyses. This is a change of a magnitude that may be clinically relevant, taking 
into account on the effect on photophobia and other clinical outcomes.  
In CHOC, while the unit of randomisation was the patient, the unit of analysis was the eye. The analyses 
performed based on “eye” may be appropriate, but for sensitivity purpose, the Applicant has re-analysed 
the primary endpoint and the key clinical endpoint of photophobia with the patient as the unit. Also in the 
analyses with the patient as the unit, the IVCM total score as well as photophobia remained significantly 
in favour of Cystadrops. These outcomes thus support a statistically significant effect also when the 
analysis was conducted with the same unit as used for randomisation, i.e. the patient. 
The secondary outcomes related to crystal deposits support the decrease observed in the primary 
evaluation, i.e. for evaluation with the IVCM as an endpoint as well as regarding the reduction of crystal 
deposits. The CCCS and Crystal thickness was significantly lower in the Cystadrops treatment arms 
compared to the control (p=0.0015 and 0.0031, respectively). 
In the subset of patients (n=9, mean age 7-8 years) that could not undergo the IVCM, the effect on CCCS 
was similar as in the FAS, but the Crystal thickness in these subjects was lower both at baseline and the 
reduction was similar in both treatment arms (7-8) and limited compared to the Cystadrops arm in the 
FAS in CHOC (-46). Also photophobia was lower at baseline, but an overall higher reduction in the 
Cystadrops treatment arm over CH 0.1 % was observed. Overall, consistency with the FAS has been 
demonstrated also in this subset of patients. 
Regarding the key clinical endpoint of photophobia, in OCT-1, it tended to improve with treatment (-0.5 
units at month 3, -0.9 units at month 60 vs. 2.5 units at baseline), but the effect seemed to have a slow 
onset and variability was high. In CHOC, at 3 months, there was a mean reduction with 0.6 units (from 
1.8) in the Cystadrops treatment arm vs. no change in the comparator arm (p=0.048). The evaluation of 
photophobia seems to provide further support of a clinically relevant effect of treatment. It was however 
not clear what this reduction means to the patients. To obtain a better understanding of the effect, the 
Applicant was asked to provide responder analyses describing the proportions of eyes (with photophobia 
at baseline) that reduce their photophobia score with ≥1 or ≥2 units in the 2 treatment arms. Of the 
approximately 85% of eyes presenting with photophobia at baseline, at day 90, 19 and 35 % in the 
Cystadrops arm reduced their photophobia with 2 and 1 units (scale 0-5), respectively, versus 0 and 7 % 
in the CH 0.10% treatment arm. With the caveats concerning the unmasked design of the study, the 
difference between treatment arms is clear and thus seems to support a meaningful benefit of treatment.  
In OCT-1, there were no effects on VA, which was not expected since most subjects had normal or close 
to normal VA at baseline. An improvement in VA was however demonstrated in both treatment groups in 
CHOC. The mean improvement was 5 vs. 3.5 letters in the Cystadrops vs. the CH 0.10% treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 37/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups. It is acknowledged that only a mild visual impairment was observed at baseline although slightly 
worse (mean 4 letters) in the Cystadrops treatment arm. In responder analyses (proportions with gain of 
≥15, ≥10 and ≥ 5 letters), the improvement in VA seemed modest and overall similar between treatment 
arms. It is however acknowledged that few subjects were included in these analyses. With the caveat of 
being a non-controlled compassionate use programme without structured follow up, it is noted that of the 
18 subjects with an impaired VA in the NPU programme, a larger improvement appeared to be reached 
after a longer than 3 months treatment duration. Thus, besides the overall low degree of VA impairment 
at baseline, the CHOC study may have been too short to detect any meaningful effects. 
Contrast sensitivity is an unproven endpoint but it would be expected that it would be affected by glare 
from the corneal deposits. In OCT-1, there were no changes in contrast sensitivity and in CHOC, there was 
an improvement vs. baseline in both treatment arms without any differences between treatment arms 
(33-35% improvement vs. baseline). The Applicant has not been able to explain why the reduction in 
corneal crystals did not translate into an expected improvement in contrast sensitivity. It can only be 
speculated, but it is possible that study CHOC was too short or that another chart than the Galinet chart 
could have been more sensitive to detect changes in this population. 
To address the concerns of lack of controlled long-term data, information from the French NPU 
programme on corneal crystals, photophobia and VA has been provided for 53 of the 106 subjects (16 
subjects 2 - 6 years old) who had undergone the baseline and at least one follow-up visit. The initial 
treatment period (3 months, period 1) and the longer-term effect (3-16 months, period 2) were 
evaluated, the latter with data from the last visit. Overall, a sustained treatment effect of Cystadrops was 
indicated. Even if this evaluation likely is prone to some subjectivity due to the non-masked evaluations, 
the proportion of eyes with severe crystal densities at baseline was reduced from 50 to 30 % with time 
and as a consequence, the proportions with mild CCCS increased.  
In subgroup analyses of adult and the paediatric population, the outcomes of the IVCM total score as well 
as of secondary endpoints were consistent with those observed in the overall CHOC study population. Of 
the paediatric subset only two <6 years of age were treated with Cystadrops (0.55%). Thus, the 
treatment experience is limited in the youngest subset covered by the indication (2-6 years old). As study 
in children from 6 months of age (measure 2 of PIP) is still pending, this is adequately addressed in the 
SmPC.  Adult patients were between 18 and 34 years except for one subject who was 62 years of age. 
Since there are no specific concerns regarding the older and elderly population, the absence of data in 
these populations is not considered necessary to be included in the SmPC.  
Unfortunately, patients still have to instil eye drops quite frequently (starting with 4 instillations per day), 
especially considering that this is a life-long treatment. The Applicant has further explained the rationale 
for the 0.55 % cysteamine concentration in Cystadrops. Non-clinical data indicate that such concentration 
was tolerated, cysteamine eye drops at the 0.55 % concentration seem most commonly used in the EU 
and the 0.55 % NIH formulation has been made commercially available in the US. The Applicant pointed 
out that some of the hospital formulations used currently necessitate up to hourly instillations and has not 
considered developing a formulation that may reduce the initial dosing frequency to less than 4 times 
daily. While this is acknowledged, further future development of the formulation is encouraged. In any 
case, in study OCT-1, the dosing frequency could be reduced in patients whose corneal deposits were 
improving. After the first 3 months of treatment, the median number of daily instillations was reduced 
from 4 to 3 (range 2-4 instillations) per day with a maintained reduction in corneal crystals. During the 
remaining part of the study, one (out of 8) subjects maintained the reduction in crystals with one 
instillation per day.  Even though the proposed dose reduction as outlined in section 4.2 of the SmPC is 
based on 8 patients from study OCT-1 only, it is a pragmatic approach that is considered reasonable.

A final issue is that the product is delivered in a glass vial and CHMP identified issues regarding the 
suitability of the vial and consequently a risk for medication error. In response to these concerns, the 
Applicant introduced improvements to Product Information and proposed a plan for a post-approval 
development of a different container closure system. This is further addressed in the Quality part of the 
assessment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The limitations of data should be put in context of the rarity of the disease as well as treatment with 
cysteamine eye drops being a standard of care in this condition. Data from the NPU programme support 
a benefit of treatment also in the longer term. Overall, the CHMP are of the view that the available clinical 
data are sufficient to conclude that Cystadrops exerts clinical efficacy in cystinosis patients with corneal 
cystine crystal deposits. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety was based on the pivotal 3-months CHOC study, the 5-year OCT-1 study and 
supportive safety data from two NPU programmes and publications. Focus of the evaluation was set on 
ocular safety. 
Reporting of local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) was defined to follow 
standard clinical trial practice. In addition, patients/parents were provided with daily diary cards where a 
number of signs and symptoms were exemplified to collect information on local adverse drug reactions 
(LADRs) after each instillation (including their duration and severity). In CHOC, other ocular symptoms 
were also reported through the diaries.

In OCT-1, the exact symptom duration was collected. The maximum duration of LADRs was 17.5 seconds, 
with a median duration of 5 seconds. The mean pain score at the time of instillation (VAS 0-100 mm) was 
27 at day 30 and tended to decrease with time with a mean score <20 from day 90 and onwards. At 
month 60, it was 7. 
Systemic AEs 
Several systemic AEs were reported in the study the majority related to the System Organ Class (SOC) of 
Surgical and medical procedures, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, Nervous system 
disorders. The Applicant regards none of them related to treatment.

With regards to patient-reported diary-based ocular AEs (LADRs), all patients in the Cystadrops arm and 
11/16 patients in the CH 0.10% arm reported at least 1 LADR. In this study, patients were not asked to 
record the duration of any LADRs, only to indicate whether they lasted more or less than an hour. Overall, 
more than 98% of the LADRs at instillation were reported to have resolved in under an hour and most 
patients reported LADRs at instillation as mild or moderate in intensity.

Additional analysis of ocular safety 
There were no increases in corneal staining in any of the two treatment arms and there were also no 
indications of a worsened inferior staining that could be indicative of drug toxicity over time, rather 
corneal staining was reduced vs. baseline. There were no increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) and 
fundus examinations revealed no specific findings. Regarding VA and contrast sensitivity, there were 
some improvements vs. baseline in both treatment arms, as reported in Clinical Efficacy section. 
Cysteamine has a chemical structure close to D-penicillamine, known to potentially interfere with the 
cross-linking of collagen fibres. Systemic administration of cysteamine has been associated with skin 
disorders resembling Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Since the cornea, and more generally the anterior 
segment of the eye, are essentially composed of collagen fibres, topical cysteamine could lead to known 
ocular manifestations of EDS. The occurrence of a number of specific symptoms, 
megalocornea/glaucoma, ectopia lentis, keratoconus, microcornea, myopia, retinal detachment and blue 
sclera as “pre-defined serious ocular adverse events”, was in consequence also to be reported. 
There were 2 eyes (adult patient) in the Cystadrops dose group and 1 eye (adult subject) in the CH 0.10% 
dose group that showed abnormal corneal topography from day 30, but no baseline evaluations were 
conducted in these subjects. No subjects developed keratoconus.  
Non-Ocular adverse events 
The most frequently reported AEs coded to the SOCs “Infections and infestations”, “Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders” and “Nervous system disorders”. No systemic AEs were considered related to 
treatment.

Two compassionate use programmes have together enrolled 359 subjects up to March 2015. All events 
were non-serious and considered as at least possibly related to treatment. There were no new AEs not 
observed in the clinical trials. 
In the French NPU programme, as of 15 March 2015, a total of 106 patients (54 below 18 years of age) 
were included.  Data from at least one follow-up visit was collected for 53 patients. For 4 patients, the AE 
resulted in a temporary treatment discontinuation.

September 24 2013 and March 15, 2015 
Safety data collected through spontaneous reporting sources (by physicians or pharmacist) participating 
in other NPU programmes in Europe (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ireland, Island and Spain), or

and Cystadrops was stopped.  
Published data

The data from 7 clinical trials reports were presented by the Applicant. The studies enrolled between 1 and 
29 patients, for an overall total of 64 treated patients. Patients received a daily regimen consisting of 4 to 
approximately 12 drops (based on a frequency of one drop per waking hour) per eye. Use of cysteamine 
in these studies ranged from approximately 3 months to 4 years. In addition, 63 subjects were exposed 
to 0.1 or 0.5% of cysteamine eye drops in the Sigma-Tau studies. 
No additional safety concerns were reported. Ocular symptoms were essentially limited to symptoms of 
irritation (burning, stinging, itching, pain and redness). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study OCT-1 
There were 2 ocular SAEs, corneal neovascularisation and papilloedema, both bilateral in the same 
patient. Worsening of corneal neovascularisation was observed after 3.5 years of treatment and 
considered to be possibly related to study treatment. Papilloedema was reported one year after treatment 
initiation and was stable over the following years in study. The investigator considered this unlikely 
related to Cystadrops and finally reported a potential relationship with azathioprine. 
There were no deaths in the study. 
Study CHOC 
Four patients experienced SAEs; 2 patients were in the Cystadrops treatment arm and 2 in the 
cysteamine hydrochloride 0.10% arm. These were gastroenteritis and fatigue (Cystadrops treatment 
arm), gastroenteritis and corneal graft rejection (CH 0.10% treatment arm). None were considered 
related to study treatment. 
There were no deaths in the study. 
Laboratory findings 
In OCT-1, clinically significant out-of-range laboratory values were reported for 3 patients: creatineamia 
for 2 patients and hypokalaemia for 1 patient. 
Safety in special populations 
Although there are no data in subjects over 65 years in, there are no specific safety concerns regarding 
the elderly population. 
A formal comparison of safety parameters between the adult and the paediatric age groups was not 
carried out. Analyses of LADRs in children < 18 years of age were performed in the CHOC study. The 
frequency of LADRs was similar between age groups, with a somewhat lower frequency in the paediatric 
population.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Formal interaction studies on the use of Cystadrops with other ocular products have not been performed. 
However, it is common for cystinosis patients to have chronic corneal irritation and “dry eyes” syndrome, 
resulting in the potential need for other concomitant ocular formulations.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patients discontinued treatment in OCT-1. In CHOC, 1 patient permanently discontinued treatment 
due to allergic conjunctivitis and 2 subjects temporarily discontinued treatment due to dizziness (crystal 
detachment in inner ear) and due to a corneal graft rejection in the left eye. In the latter case, treatment 
was restarted in the right eye only.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Although it is recognised that treatment with eye drops containing cysteamine is a standard of care in 
corneal cystinosis, the safety database is limited and consists of 8 patients from the 5-year OCT-1 study 
and 31 patients from the 3-months CHOC study, out of which 15 were treated with Cystadrops. The 
long-term experience in a controlled setting is thus very limited.  In the Cystadrops and CH 0.10% 
treatment arms in the CHOC study, eye pain (stinging 80 % vs. 50%), ocular hyperaemia (60% vs. 44%), 
eye irritation (burning 67% vs. 25%), vision blurred (60% vs. 25%) and eye pruritis (40% vs. 25%) were 
most frequently reported by the patients. Therefore, a major concern was raised regarding a potential 
increased risk of LADRs and other more serious AEs in the long-term with potential consequences for 
compliance to treatment. Although under-reporting is likely, also in this regard, the reporting from the 
ongoing NPU programmes gives some reassurance. For the 106 subjects included in the French 
programme, there was a structured follow-up. The type of AEs from these programmes seems consistent 
with those observed in the clinical trials and in the 57 patients treated for ≥6 months as well as in the 28 
patients treated for ≥12 months, no new or worsening of AEs were reported after the initial 3 months of 
treatment and there were no serious or unexpected findings. 
The efficacy data from NPU programme also indicate a maintained effect (mean of 7-8 months of 
treatment), which would not be expected in case of lack of compliance. There was also no evidence of 
development of local intolerance or an increased risk of LADRs or other more serious adverse events in 
relation to the viscosity and low pH of Cystadrops.  Taking into account the data from the clinical and NPU 
programmes, the safety profile of Cystadrops was regarded to be acceptable. In addition, the Applicant 
has committed to conduct a 5-year Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS), 
In addition to the NPU programmes addressed above, published data including 88 subjects exposed to 
relevant concentrations of cysteamine eye drops in various formulations also support the observed safety 
profile and provide additional long-term data. Although reassuring, as these are published data, a 
thorough assessment cannot be made and from some of these studies there are indications of 
under-reporting of AEs.  
As only a relatively short-term comparison against the less concentrated formulation i.e. CH 0.10% was 
carried-out in the CHOC Study, it is not possible to characterise whether the patient-reported LADRs were 
due to the active compound as such or due to the high viscosity and low pH of the Cystadrops formulation.  
The Applicant has reported ocular and non-ocular AEs, but focused on ocular safety. The vast majority of 
patients with cystinosis are treated with concomitant oral cysteamine at substantially higher doses (1- 2 
grams/day) than given by the ocular route (approximately 2 mg/day). The additive systemic exposure is 
expected to be negligible and systemic reactions, if any, related to topical cysteamine are not expected to 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 46/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be distinguishable from those obtained after systemic cysteamine treatment. Thus, the focus on 
evaluation of ocular safety was supported.  
The overall AE profile was predominated by a high incidence of generally transient reactions like stinging, 
blurring, irritation, itching, redness etc. associated with instillation of the eye drops.  
Treatment-emerging and treatment-related AEs in OCT-1 were reported in 2 subjects with one event each 
of aggravation of pre-existing corneal neovascularisation (possibly treatment-related), dry eye and 
hordeolum. All were mild to moderate. With regards to corneal neovascularisation, as this is also 
associated with corneal cystinosis, a firm conclusion on the relation to treatment cannot be drawn. 
Therefore, it is acceptable not to include this AE in the SmPC but only address it as a potential risk in the 
RMP. In addition, in OCT-1 study, one SAE of papilloedema was reported as SAEs. Papilloedema was not 
regarded to be treatment-related. It was agreed that it is more likely that it was caused by any (or the 
combination) of the concomitant drugs administered (azathioprine and cyclosporine). 
In CHOC, the frequency of treatment-emerging AEs (investigator-reported) was overall higher in the CH 
0.10% comparator group. In the Cystadrops and the CH 0.10% treatment arms, ocular hyperaemia (27 
vs. 31%), eye pain (7 vs. 19%) and eye irritation (13 vs. 12%) were most frequently reported. 
Treatment-related AEs of eye pain, eye irritation, dry eye, visual impairment and lacrimation increased 
were reported for single patients in the Cystadrops arm. In addition, eye pruritus was reported in the CH 
0.10% arm. There were also events, mostly single, of keratitis, conjunctivitis and dry eye (regarded 
non-related to treatment) in the CH 0.10% treatment arm. According to published data, keratitis, dry eye 
and visual impairment are potential manifestations of the disease while conjunctivitis and lacrimation 
increased has not been reported as related to cystinosis. The SmPC has now been updated accordingly to 
reflect the profile of Cystadrops. 
As patients were instructed to report local reactions upon instillation and a number of such LADRs were 
listed in the patient diaries to guide the patients, it is not surprising that the rate of reporting was high 
with frequencies ranging from very common (>1/10) to common (>1/100). The LADRs were generally 
transient and as assessed in OCT-1, their intensity tended to decrease over the duration of the study. Also 
in CHOC, the LADRs were generally transient (98% resolved within 1 hour) with a few events of ocular 
hyperaemia and blurred vision lasting for more than 1 hour. Despite a fairly high rate of severe reactions, 
compliance was high indicating that patients could manage the reactions. 
A number of patients presented with abnormal corneal topography however there was no evidence that 
this developed during treatment with Cystadrops (or CH 0.1 %). Evaluations of corneal staining, 
keratoconus, IOP and fundus examinations revealed no specific findings. While no worsening of corneal 
staining is reassuring, CHOC was rather short in duration and the choice of BAK as preservative in a 
formulation intended for life-long treatment in subjects (including the paediatric subset) with an impaired 
corneal health needed further justification. The Applicant has considered developing a non-preserved 
formulation of Cystadrops but explained, that since cysteamine is easily oxidised and then inactivated, 
the polymers in a single-dose cannot be permeable to oxygen. No appropriate alternative has been found. 
In addition, the available multi-dose containers that either includes a filter or silver spiral seems 
inappropriate (cannot be filtered or oxidation increases). It has been recognised that such development is 
difficult. The Applicant has also expressed a concern that efficacy could be reduced if BAK, a compound 
that is well known to work as a permeability enhancer, is removed. Further evaluation whether it would be 
possible to develop an alternative non-preserved formulation or a formulation with an alternative 
preservative would be desired. Initially, the effect of BAK could, for example, be investigated in in vitro 
permeability models (e.g. an in vitro corneal permeability model).

Cysteamine may have a potential to interfere with the cross-linking of collagen fibres resulting in 
disorders similar to that of EDS. Ocular manifestations of EDS (type VI) have been reported to include dry 
eyes, keratoconus, myopia (thin and fragile sclera), scleral rupture, retinal detachment, glaucoma, 
strabism and hyperextensible eye lids and any such events were to be reported in CHOC. Only OCT-1 has 
a sufficient duration to evaluate any potential risks of the development of EDS-like manifestations, 
however, this study was non-controlled and too limited in size. In addition, in wound healing and wound 
strength collagen and collagen fibres play critical roles and this is a patient population where corneal 
grafting is not uncommon. The potential risks of EDS-like ocular manifestations are addressed in the RMP 
and will be further evaluated in the proposed PASS.  
In CHOC, there were 4 SAEs, gastroenteritis and fatigue (Cystadrops treatment arm), gastroenteritis and 
corneal graft rejection (CH 0.10% treatment arm). None of the SAEs were considered related to study 
treatment. Although it cannot be completely excluded that initiation of CH 0.10% 11 days after grafting 
could have contributed to the event, the event had characteristics of an acute rejection episode and the 
investigator’s conclusion that it was not related to treatment is considered reasonable.  
In OCT-1, 3 patients reported clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters: creatineamia and 
hypokalemia. These are considered likely related to the underlying disease, nephropathic cystinosis and 
thus unlikely to be related to treatment with Cystadrops. 
As detailed in the discussion on efficacy, the treatment experience with the 0.55% formulation is limited 
in the youngest subset of the paediatric population (2-6 years old). Since there are no specific concerns 
regarding the older and elderly population, the absence of data in these populations is not considered 
necessary to include in the SPC. Similarly, the addition of cysteamine eye drops on top of oral treatment 
is not likely to contribute to a specific risk in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment as the additive 
systemic exposure over that obtained by oral cysteamine is expected to be negligible. As the dosing 
frequency is to be based on the response to treatment and there is no specific safety concern, the dose 
should not be adjusted in these subjects. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP was of the view that the available safety data were sufficient to support the application for 
Cystadrops in the treatment of cystinosis. The CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Cystadrops was 
acceptable with the majority of adverse reactions being eye disorders and related to the instillation of the 
eye drops, while the risk of systemic exposure and adverse reactions was considered low. The safety 
profile was furthermore considered adequately reflected in the product information and all safety 
concerns were addressed in the RMP.  
In addition, the Applicant has committed to conducting an open-label, longitudinal post authorisation 
safety study to characterise long term safety of Cystadrops in more detail.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystinosis is a rare genetic autosomal recessive disease. It is caused by a lysosomal transport defect 
resulting in the intracellular accumulation of cystine. Cystine accumulates within lysosomes, forming 
crystal deposits in many tissues, including the kidneys and the eyes, but also in bone marrow, lymph 
nodes, intestine, spleen, liver, pancreas, gonads, thyroid, muscles, and in the central nervous system.  
Corneal cystine crystals that can be seen in the corneal epithelium and the stroma are specific 
characteristics of all phenotypes of cystinosis. They appear as a myriad of needle-shaped highly reflective 
opacities. By 1 year of age, cystine crystals can be evidenced in the cornea by slit lamp. By approximately 
7 years of age, the entire peripheral stroma accumulates crystals, and by approximately 20 years of age, 
crystals can be seen in the entire corneal stroma.  
The crystals are initially asymptomatic but photophobia, resulting from the diffraction of light by the 
cystine crystals, is common and develops within the first few years of life. Many patients begin wearing 
sunglasses in early childhood. Superficial punctate keratopathy and pain are occasionally observed, 
mostly in patients older than 10 years of age. Other more severe complications of crystal deposits are 
corneal erosions, loss of visual contrast sensitivity, increased glare disability, decreased corneal 
sensitivity and increased corneal thickness. In very young patients, visual acuity (VA) is usually not

affected, however, in older patients where corneal complications are more common, these may lead to 
visual impairment. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies  
All cystinosis patients are treated by oral administration of cysteamine (Cystagon and Procysbi) aiming to 
reduce intracellular cystine accumulation, therefore delaying organ and tissue damage. While oral 
administration of cysteamine reduces intracellular cystine accumulation in non-corneal tissues, 
systemically administered cysteamine does not reach the cornea and has consequently no effect on 
corneal cystine deposits.  
To dissolve cystine crystal deposits in the cornea, the established approach is to use eye drops solutions 
containing cysteamine, but there are no licenced treatment options in the EU. Currently, eye drop 
formulations at concentrations between 0.10% - 1.13% are prepared ex tempore, e.g. by pharmacies at 
local hospitals. A range of different posologies, including hourly instillations, are applied. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development of Cystadrops consisted of 2 studies: one open-label, single-arm 5-year study 
where the dosing frequency was adapted based on response and one randomised, controlled superiority 
3-months trial vs. a standard of care formulation of cysteamine (CH 0.10%) used in France.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pilot, single-arm study OCT-1, the absolute reduction in corneal crystals as measured with IVCM 
from baseline to 60 months was 3.4±2.8 units, which corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction vs. 
baseline. The reduction was observed from month 1 (-1.5±2.4 units, -13%) and remained fairly stable 
between month 3 to month 60. The dosing frequency was adapted based on treatment response and from 
month 3, the average number of instillations of Cystadrops was reduced from the initial mean of 4 to a 
mean of 3 drops per day which may explain the absence of a further reduction in crystals. 
In the pivotal CHOC study, the absolute reduction in corneal crystals from baseline to month 3 as 
measured with the IVCM (primary efficacy) was 4.6±3.1 units (-40.4%) in the Cystadrops treatment arm 
and 0.5±3.4 units (-0.8%) in the CH 0.10% comparator arm (a standard of care, ex tempore formulation 
of 0.10% cysteamine). The difference between treatment arms was 3.8 ± 0.9 (95% CI 2.1, 5.6, 
p<0.0001). Superiority of Cystadrops over CH 0.10% was supported in the PPS (difference 3.5, 95% CI 
1.7, 5.3, p=0.0002), in sensitivity analyses as well as in the analyses of CCCS (p=0.0015) and crystal 
thickness (p=0.0031). Further, the ICVM outcomes were consistent with the outcomes in the primary 
analysis when each corneal layer was weighed according to the relative thickness of each layer. 
In OCT-1, there was a 0.9 unit (-36%) reduction in photophobia at month 60 vs. baseline. The reduction 
seemed slower in onset (-0.5 at month 3) compared to the reduction in corneal crystals.  In CHOC, the 
reduction in photophobia from baseline to month 3 was 0.6 ± 0.8 units (-33%) in the Cystadrops 
treatment arm and a minimal increase of 0.06±0.44 units (+5%) in the CH 0.10% comparator arm 
(p=0.0048). The difference between treatment arms was supported in the PPS (p=0.0320). Between 
baseline and day 90 (in patients with photophobia at baseline), photophobia was reduced with 2 and 1 
units (scale 0-5) in 19 and 35 % in the Cystadrops arm, respectively, versus 0 and 7 % in the CH 0.10% 
treatment arm. 
In OCT-1, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity remained fairly stable. In CHOC, an improvement in visual 
acuity was demonstrated in both treatment groups. The mean improvement was LogMar -0.10 ± 0.15 
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 52/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(+5 letters) vs. LogMar -0.07 ± 0.15 (+3.5 letters) in the Cystadrops vs. the CH 0.10% treatment groups. 
In responder analyses, (proportions with gain of ≥15, ≥10 and ≥ 5 letters), the improvement in VA 
seemed modest and overall similar between treatment arms, but the level of visual impairment was 
limited at baseline. With regards to contrast sensitivity, there was a 33-35% improvement vs. baseline 
without any differences between treatment arms.  
To further support a sustained effect of treatment, the Applicant has presented available efficacy data 
from 53 of 106 subjects with baseline and at least one follow up visits enrolled in the French NPU 
programme. After mean treatment durations of 7-8 months, the proportion of eyes with severe crystal 
densities (CCCS) at baseline was reduced from 50 to 30 % with time and as a consequence, the 
proportion of patients with mild CCCS increased. With regards to photophobia, the overall reduction 
seemed less pronounced compared to the CHOC study, however, after 7 months on treatment, the 
proportion of subjects with a ≥ 2 step reduction increased while the corresponding proportions with a ≥
1 step reduction increased compared to the analysis made after 3 months. Finally, the number of subjects 
with a relevant gain in VA (≥15 letters) was increased from between month 3 and 8. In subjects with no 
photophobia or visual acuity reduction at baseline, progression was inhibited in the majority of patients. 
With the limitations of being a non-controlled compassionate use programme, efficacy seemed to be 
maintained, and potentially also increased with time, however, progression was not stopped in all 
patients. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While the evaluation of primary efficacy was based on images evaluated by an independent and masked 
reader, images for evaluation were selected by an unmasked ophthalmologist. There is thus a potential 
for a selection bias which leaves the pivotal study without any truly masked evaluations. This is 
unfortunate and adds uncertainty to the magnitude of the effect size. However, the overall effect size 
seems convincing. Additional support for this conclusion is derived from the effect on photophobia and 
other clinical outcomes measured as secondary endpoints.  
Support for sustained efficacy has been provided from the NPU programmes. However, these are data 
were collected from a non-controlled setting and the effect sizes observed should be interpreted with 
caution.  
The experience in children 2-6 years of age is limited.  
The dosing frequency generally recommended for the comparator, CH 0.10%, used in the CHOC study is 
every hour while awake and not 4 times/day. On one hand, it could be argued that since CH 0.10 % was 
administered only 4 times/day in the study, this dosing was suboptimal. On the other, a 
placebo-controlled study would be difficult to conduct in this condition, and CH 0.10 % would therefore be 
expected to provide assay sensitivity. Since superiority was aimed for, and demonstrated, this was 
achieved. While a different outcome may have been observed if CH 0.-10 % would have been 
administered hourly, there is a benefit also in being able to reduce the frequency of instillations. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AE profile of Cystadrops is dominated by very common or common local reactions such as eye pain, 
ocular hyperaemia, eye irritation, vision blurred and eye pruritus upon instillation. The vast majority of 
the reactions observed in clinical trials were transient (within 1 hour or less). Although almost half of the 
reactions were reported as severe at one or more of the instillations, compliance to treatment was high. 
This indicates that the patients could manage the reactions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/738656/2016 
Page 53/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further safety reporting from the NPU programmes has been provided. Between September 2013 and 
March 2015, a total of 28 non-serious AEs, at least possibly related to treatment were reported. The 
reporting supports the safety profile characterised in the clinical studies as there were no unexpected, not 
previously identified AEs. In the 57 patients treated for ≥6 months as well as in the 28 patients treated 
for ≥12 months, all AEs were reported during the initial 3 months of treatment. There are thus no signals 
indicative of an induction of local intolerance or an increased risk of LADRs or other more serious AEs in 
relation to the viscosity and low pH of Cystadrops.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited and consists of 8 patients from the 5-year OCT-1 study and 31 patients 
from the 3-months CHOC study, of whom 15 were treated with Cystadrops. The long-term experience in 
a controlled setting is thus very limited and no conclusions can be drawn whether LADRs and potentially 
more serious AEs may increase during the long-term (chronic) treatment that is expected in corneal 
cystinosis and whether this may have potential consequences for compliance to treatment. While the 
additional safety reports provided from the NPU programmes support the safety profile from the clinical 
trials, it is likely that there is an under-reporting and there is still some uncertainty regarding the 
long-term safety profile. To further characterise the long term safety of Cystadrops, the Applicant will 
conduct a 5-year PASS with focus on local AEs, SAEs and potential ocular manifestations of EDS.  
Treatment-emerging and treatment-related AEs of mild to moderate nature in OCT-1 were reported in 2 
subjects with one event each of aggravation of pre-existing corneal neovascularisation (SAE), dry eye, 
hordeolum. As corneal neovascularisation also is associated with the disease, a conclusion on the relation 
to treatment cannot be drawn.  
Cystadrops may interfere with the cross-linking of collagen fibres and there is a potential risk of serious 
complications similar to the ocular manifestations of EDS, e.g. dry eyes, keratoconus, myopia (thin and 
fragile sclera), scleral rupture, retinal detachment, glaucoma, strabism and hyperextensible eye lids. 
Collagen is also a key-player in wound healing and patients with EDS have an impaired wound healing. 
While no such events were reported in the studies and there are no literature data that indicate that 
corneal wound healing may be negatively affected by cysteamine containing eye drops, this is adequately 
addressed in the RMP.  
The treatment experience is limited in the youngest subset of the paediatric population (2-6 years old).  
It is not possible to determine whether the LADRs were due to the active compound or due to the 
Cystadrops formulation as the initially considered active comparator, a less viscous 0.55% formulation of 
cysteamine was not used.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The 30 to 40% reduction in corneal crystals is supported by a similar mean relative reduction in key 
clinical endpoint, photophobia. Responder analyses of photophobia support a clinically relevant treatment 
effect. Data from the NPU programme has further provided indications of a sustained effect of treatment 
over time, however, also these data are rather limited, originate from a non-controlled setting and should 
thus be interpreted with caution.  
In the EU, there is currently no approved medicinal product for the treatment of the corneal 
manifestations of cystinosis. While there are some uncertainties regarding the effect sizes due to the 
open-label design of the study, Cystadrops was superior over the 0.10% cysteamine formulation (CH 
0.10%) that is part of the current standard of care in the EU. In subjects treated with CH 0.10%, there 
was no further disease progression, however, no reduction in either corneal crystals or photophobia was 
observed. The improvement demonstrated with Cystadrops was consistent and addresses an unmet 
medical need. The effect is thus considered of clear benefit to the patients.  
Although the safety database is very limited, in context of the rarity of the disease as well as taking into 
account that the treatment with cysteamine eye drops is a standard of care in this condition, Cystadrops 
seems fairly well tolerated even though the incidence of transient, local reactions was very high. As the 
number of discontinuations was very low, it indicates that the patients find the local adverse reactions

manageable. Although the incidence of the patient-reported local reactions was higher with Cystadrops 
than with the CH 0.10% comparator, this is balanced against the superior efficacy obtained with 
Cystadrops.  
Reporting from the compassionate use programmes as well as literature data support the safety profile in 
the clinical studies and there were no unexpected, not previously identified AEs. There are thus no signals 
indicative of an induction of local intolerance or an increased risk of LADRs or other more serious AEs in 
relation to the viscosity and low pH of Cystadrops. With the limitations of being a non-controlled 
compassionate use programme, the efficacy data provided from the French programme also give an 
indirect indication that compliance was not a critical issue over a 7-8 months (mean treatment duration of 
the 53 subjects with follow-up visits) since efficacy seemed to be maintained. In addition, the long-term 
safety profile will be characterised in more detail during 5-year Post Authorisation Safety Study. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP is of the view that the clinical data is sufficient to conclude that Cystadrops exerts clinical 
efficacy in cystinosis patients with corneal cystine crystal deposits. The safety profile was found to be 
acceptable.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The container closure system consisting of a glass vial and a separate dropper applicator is not optimal 
from a microbiological and user friendly point of view and may lead to a risk for contamination (increased 
risk for infection) and medication error. There have also been reports regarding problems during 
instillation. The Applicant has therefore introduced a number of clarifications in the Product Information 
which aim to mitigate these risks. In addition, a plan for post approval development of a new container 
(ready to use bottles with dropper already in place) has been agreed as a recommendation.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cystadrops is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cystadrops is not similar to Procysbi within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Cystadrops is favourable in the following indication: 
Cystadrops is indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children from 2 
years of age with cystinosis. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

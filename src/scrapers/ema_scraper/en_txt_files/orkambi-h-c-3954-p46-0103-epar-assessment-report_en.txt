1.  Introduction 
On 20 November 2019, the MAH submitted a post-approval Observational Study to Evaluate the Long-
term  Effectiveness  and  Safety  of  Orkambi  (Study  120),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure REC 10.1, recommendation to 
submit a final clinical study report of Study VX16 809 120. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study VX16 809 120 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
At the time of the initial Orkambi approval in the EU, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) requested the MAH to explore the possibility of a longer follow-up (i.e. 5 years) of study 
population enrolled in the phase 3 study (study 105) submitted in support of the indication in patients 
12 years and older.  
Because  the  majority  of  subjects  had  completed  Study  105  at  the  time  of  this  request,  Vertex 
determined  that  extending  this  study  for  an  additional  3  years  was  not  feasible  and  has  explored 
alternative  approaches  to  evaluate  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  in  this  population.  Vertex  explored 
the  feasibility  of  identifying  and  evaluating  Study  105  participants  via  existing  national  CF  patient 
registries in US and EU. In general, to fulfill the study objectives, only large, research-experienced CF 
patient  registries  with  broad  national  CF  patient  coverage,  high  quality  standard  data  collection,  and 
timely  data  availability  can  be  used.  The  registries  initially  meeting  these  criteria  included  US  Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR), the largest CF patient registry worldwide, and a number 
of  CF  patient  registries  in  EU  countries.  Based  on  further  assessment  of  feasibility,  evaluated  EU 
registries were considered not suitable for the purposes of the study due to various reasons, including 
low  national  coverage  (e.g.,  Spain,  50%),  significant  data  availability  lags  and/or  data  quality  issues 
(e.g.,  Italy;  as  of  2017,  the  most  recent  data  available  are  from  2014),  or  very  small  Study  105 
patient  pool  (e.g.,  UK,  France,  Germany,  Sweden,  Austria,  and  Denmark).  Because  a  significant 
proportion  of  subjects  who  completed  Study  105  Part  A  were  from  the  US  (N  =  485;  53%),  Vertex 
conducted Study 120 that followed only US subjects from Study 105 who were also enrolled in the US 
CFFPR for 3 years after the completion of Study 105. 
Study  105  was  a  96-week,  Phase  3,  parallel-group,  multicentre,  rollover  study  in  subjects  with  CF, 
homozygous  or  heterozygous  for  F508del,  who  participated  in  Study  103  or  Study  104  (homozygous 
subjects) or in Cohort 4 of Study 102 (heterozygous subjects). Study 105 Part A (referred to hereafter 
as Study 105) enrolled subjects from Studies 103 and 104, who were 12 years and older at screening 
in parent studies. 
In Study 105 Part A treatment cohort, a total of 1030 subjects were enrolled of whom, 1029 subjects 
were dosed with LUM/IVA: 513 subjects received LUM 600 mg once daily (qd) with IVA (179 subjects 
received placebo in the previous study) and 516 subjects received LUM 400 mg every 12 hours (q12h) 
with  IVA  (176  subjects  received  placebo  in  the  previous  study).  Subjects  who  received  LUM/IVA  in 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 4/5 
 
  
 
 
Study  103  or  104  continued  to  receive  the  same  dose  and  regimen  of  study  drug  in  a  double-blind 
fashion in Study 105 for 96 weeks in order to maintain the blind from the previous studies. Subjects 
who received placebo in Study 103 or 104 were randomized (1:1) to 1 of the 2 double-blind treatment 
groups.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (<18  versus  ≥18  years  of  age),  sex  (male  versus 
female), and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) severity (<70% versus 
≥70% predicted) collected at baseline or the Screening Visit of the subject’s previous study. 
As regard to the recommended Orkambi dose arm, 340 patients continued treatment with lumacaftor 
400  mg  every  12  h/ivacaftor  250  mg  every  12  h;  176  patients  who  had  received  placebo  in  the 
parental  studies  (TRANSPORT  or  TRAFFIC  studies)  initiated  treatment  with  lumacaftor  400  mg  every 
12  h/ivacaftor  250  mg  every  12  h.  These  results  have  been  published  (Konstan  et  al,  Lancet  Respir 
Med,  2017)  and  in  the  publication  the  estimated  annual  rate  of  decline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1 
(ppFEV1)  in  treated  patients  was  compared  with  that  of  a  matched  registry  cohort  (Supplementary 
material to Konstan et al. Lancet Respir Med 2016; published online Dec 20).  
The focus of the efficacy in the final analysis of Study 105 was based on the Cumulative Study Period, 
which starts from the first dose of the study drug in the previous study to the last day in Study 105. 
The  analysis  for  efficacy  endpoints  was  focused  on  within-group  comparisons.  No  between  groups 
comparisons were performed. The interpretation of Study 105 results is hampered by a large amount 
of missing data (mostly due to US patients who transitioned to commercially available Orkambi), and a 
combination of previous and current study periods. 
Among  the  1029  dosed  subjects,  411  (39.9%)  completed  treatment  and  618  (60.1%)  prematurely 
discontinued treatment; the incidence of discontinuation was similar across all 4 treatment groups. The 
majority of discontinuations after Week 60 were US patients who transitioned to commercially available 
Orkambi.  Because  the  decrease  in  sample  size  could  affect  the  robustness  of  data  analyses,  the 
primary efficacy analyses were performed using data up to Week 72 of Study 105. Sensitivity analyses 
included data up to Week 96. Although the efficacy seems to be sustained during the initial 24 weeks, 
a  trend  of  decaying  beyond  Week  24  was  observed  in  Study  105:  for  subjects  who  received  active 
treatment  in  both  Study  103/104  and  Study  105,  the  improvements  in  ppFEV1  from  previous  study 
baseline  during  Study  103/104  were  generally  sustained  in  Study  105  up  to  Extension  Week  36  for 
L600qd/I group and Extension Week 24 for L400q12h/I group. The improvement in ppFEV1 decreased 
over  time  in  both  groups  with  small/no  improvement  in  ppFEV1  at  Extension  Week  96.  The  least 
square (LS) mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for the L400q12h/I group (the authorized 
dose  for  this  age  group)  was  1.6  percentage  points  (P  =  0.0012)  at  Week  60;  at  Week  72,  the 
L400q12h/I  group  result  was  numerically  above  baseline  but  lacked  within-treatment  statistical 
significance (P = 0.2806). 
However,  the  treatment  with  LUM/IVA  (L400q12h/I)  in  Study  105  showed  a  slower  annual  rate  of 
ppFEV1  decline  (-1.33  percentage  points/year)  vs.  matched  controls  using  data  from  2012  to  2014 
obtained from the US CFFPR (-2.29 percentage points/year).  
For  the  L400q12h/I  group,  the  change  in  BMI  was  0∙69  kg/m2  (95%CI:  0∙56  to  0∙81)  at  extension 
week 72 and 0∙96 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0∙81 to 1∙11) at extension week 96, thus the effect was maintained 
with  respect  to  baseline.  The  annualised  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PEX)  rate  in  patients  continuing 
treatment  through  extension  week  96  (0∙65  events  per  patient-year,  95%CI:  0∙56  to  0∙75)  for  the 
L400q12h/I group remained lower than the PBO rate in pivotal trials, (Study 103/104: 1.19 events per 
patient-year). 
The  introduction  in  Study  105  of  study  drugs  to  the  LUM/IVA-naïve  subjects  from  Study  103/104 
confirms reproducibility of efficacy.

2.2.2.  Clinical study  
A Post-approval Observational Study to Evaluate the Long-term Effectiveness and Safety of 
Orkambi in US Patients Who Completed Study VX12-809-105 Part A 
Description 
Methods 
Objective  
To  evaluate  the  long-term  effectiveness  and  safety  of  Orkambi  in  US  patients  who  completed  Study 
105 using secondary data from the US CFFPR. 
Study design 
This was a 3-year observational study for the cohort A of Study 105 US subjects who were enrolled in 
the US CFFPR and provided consent for their US CFFPR data to be evaluated by the MAH.  
Annual registry data from 2016 through 2018 were evaluated, ensuring 3 years of US CFFPR follow-up 
among subjects who completed Study 105. 
Study population /Sample size 
US  subjects  who  completed  treatment  with  LUM/IVA  in  Study  105,  who  continued  to  be  treated  with 
Orkambi,  were  enrolled  in  the  US  CFFPR,  and  provided  consent  for  their  US  CFFPR  data  to  be 
evaluated. 
Inclusion criteria, patients:  
1. were homozygous for F508del;  
2. completed Part A of Study 105;  
3. consented to have their data evaluated; and  
4. had evidence of treatment with Orkambi following completion of Study 105 (as captured in the US 
CFFPR).  
Patients who met the inclusion criteria are hereafter referred to as the Orkambi Cohort. 
Sample  size:  a  total  of  485  subjects  from  the  US  completed  Study  105  and  were  eligible  to 
participate in Study 120 if they continued to be treated with Orkambi, were enrolled in the US CFFPR, 
and provided consent for their US CFFPR data to be evaluated.  
Treatments Exposure 
Orkambi  exposure  after  the  date of  Study  105  completion  for  each patient  was  determined  based  on 
the  record  of  Orkambi  treatment  as  identified  in  the  US  CFFPR.  Patients  were  considered  to  remain 
exposed to Orkambi until there was no evidence of treatment in the US CFFPR.  
Precise  Orkambi  treatment  initiation  and  discontinuation  dates  were  not  available  in  the  US  CFFPR. 
Because start and stop dates were not available from the US CFFPR, the algorithm to extrapolate the 
duration of exposure included the following rules: the date of the first encounter (evidence of Orkambi 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 7/8 
 
  
 
 
 
 
exposure)  was  used  as  the  start  date.  Patients  were  identified  as  exposed  to  Orkambi  until  a 
medications  form  was  completed  when  Orkambi  treatment  was  not  reported,  the  patient  was  lost  to 
follow-up, or the patient died. The Orkambi stop date was the first encounter date when exposure was 
not indicated, the patient was lost to follow-up, or the patient died.  
In  the  analyses,  Orkambi  exposure  was  categorized  into  meaningful  groups  based  on  the  duration  of 
exposure, such as <1 year, ≥1 to <2 years, and ≥2 years. 
CHMP comment 
Limitations  coming  from  the  use  of  a  registry  as  data  source  and  also  from  only  one  selected  source 
(US registry, only some sites) should be considered.  
Moreover,  the  US  CFFPR  as  a  data  source  for  this  study  utilizes  encounter-based  data  collection  and 
records the data from each patient visit in the real-world setting; the clinical outcome definitions used 
in  the  US  CFFPR  and  the  mechanisms  and  guidelines  for  data  collection  were  different  from  those 
definitions used in Studies 105, 103, and 104. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Statistical Methods 
Data  source: the US CFFPR tracks the treatments and health of people with CF across the US and is 
the largest CF patient registry in the geographic regions covered by Study 105. Information is collected 
on  patients  who  receive  care  at  more  than  110  CFF-accredited  care  centers  and  who  agree  to 
participate in the registry. The US CFFPR includes approximately 29,000 patients with CF, representing 
81% to 84% of all people with CF in the country. 
Data from the US CFFPR were used for all study analyses.  
Data  management  was  maintained  at  the  US  CFFPR  according  to  their  internal  processes.  Only  final 
analysis  tables  (i.e.,  no  patient-level  data  from  the  registries)  were  provided  to  the  marketing 
authorization holder 
The  CF  centers  were  responsible  for  the  quality  of  the  US  CFFPR  data.  The  annual  grants  application 
signed  by  all  center  directors  had  a  clause  that  stated  that  the  registry  data  provided  by  the  center 
were accurate to the best of the center director’s knowledge.  
Variables: all study variables were derived from existing data in the US CFFPR that were collected in 
prespecified  data  collection  forms.  Investigators  (physicians  with  expertise  in  CF)  from  certified  CF 
centers completed the forms according to the data guidelines and indicated the specified diagnoses for 
patients. The US CFFPR’s own data entry guideline was used. 
The US CFFPR independently determined the data to be collected within the US CFFPR.  
Statistical  methods:  US  CFFPR  data  were  analyzed  for  3  years.  Separate  annual  analyses  were 
performed  based  on  the  2016,  2017,  and  2018  data.  All  analyses  were  descriptive  and  based  on 
observed trends over time.  
Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  the  following  descriptive  summary  statistics  in  each  of 
the analysis years: (1) number of patients (n); (2) mean; (3) SD; (4) SE; (5) median; (6) minimum 
value;  (7)  maximum  value;  and  (8)  95%  CI,  as  appropriate.  Categorical  variables  were  summarized 
using the number and percentage of patients and the 95% CI.  
For  event-based  categorical  endpoints  (e.g.,  hospitalizations  and  PEx),  the  number  of  events  and 
annual risks with 95% CI were calculated for each of the 3 analysis years. Percentages were presented 
to 1 decimal place, unless otherwise specified.  
For each analysis year, only patients who continued to be treated with Orkambi were included, and the 
number  and  percentage  of  patients  who  did  not  have  any  record  of  Orkambi  use  within  the  whole 
calendar year was tabulated.  
A  stratified  analysis  of  both  continuous  and  categorical  endpoints  could  be  carried  out  as  appropriate 
on important patient characteristics (e.g., ppFEV1 by patient characteristics [age, gender]).  
No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. No imputation of missing data was conducted 
in  the  course  of  statistical  analyses;  however,  sensitivity  analyses  could  be  performed  if  deemed 
necessary and applicable. 
Summary statistics for the overall population and for the following subgroups was tabulated:  
• Age at the start of Analysis Year 1 (<18 years, ≥18 years)  
• Sex (male, female)  
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 8/9 
 
  
 
 
• ppFEV1 at the start of Analysis Year 1 (<70, ≥70)  
Safety: all safety endpoint analyses were performed in the overall study population. The number and 
percentage  of  patients  with  i)  LFT  elevations  (ALT,  AST,  BILI)  relative  to  the  upper  limit  of  normal 
(ULN),  ii)    a  record  of  hypertension,  death  (overall  and  by  type  of  death),  or  organ  transplantation 
(overall and by organ) were tabulated for each analysis year.  
Ad hoc analyses were done as summarized below:  
• BMI was stratified by age in 2016 (<20 and ≥20 years of age). Weight-for-age z-scores for patients 
<20 years of age in 2016 were also calculated; 
•  Sensitivity  analyses  of  all  endpoints  in  patients  with  evidence  of  Orkambi  exposure  in  all  3  study 
years were performed. 
CHMP comment 
Variables  derived  from  existing  data  in  the  US  CFFPR  that  were  collected  in  pre-specified  data 
collection  forms.  The  US  CFFPR’s  own  data  entry  guideline    was  followed,  therefore  a  standardized 
procedure  was  in  place  for  data  collection.  Statistical  analyses  were  descriptive  and  not  formal 
hypotheses were conducted.  
With  regard  to  the  paediatric  subset,  the  MAH  conducted  some  subgroup  or  ad  hoc  analyses.  It  is 
highlighted that the focus of this procedure is the paediatric setting from 12 years and older and that 
these data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure REC 10.1, recommendation to 
submit a final clinical study report of Study VX16-809-120.

CHMP comment 
This  study  planned  to  include  all  US  Study  105  Part  A  participants  homozygous  for  F508del,  who 
completed treatment with LUM/IVA, were enrolled in the US CFFPR, and provided consent for their US 
CFFPR data to be evaluated. However, only a subset of US sites consented to participate in Study 120.  
Out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 
in  the  2016;  239  in  the  2017;  202  in  the  2018).  Reasons  for  exclusion  were  patients  from  the  US 
Clinical  sites  who  did  not  participate  in  Study  120  (n=129),  patients  who  did  not  consent  (n=67), 
patients with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in 2016 in US CFFPR (N=31). 
From the available data, it seems that Orkambi discontinuation (desumed from the number of patients 
with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in US CFFPR) ranged between 5% and 14% per year (31/287, 
11%  in  2016;  13/256,  5%  in  2017;  34/239,  14%  in  2018).  However,  no  information  is  available  on 
the  reasons  for  discontinuation,  and  no  follow  up  data  after  Orkambi  discontinuation  have  been 
provided.  Thus,  patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  proportion  of  the  patient 
population  enrolled  in  study  105,  and  the  external  validity  of  study  results  appears  questionable  and 
should be further discussed by the MAH (OC).

CHMP comment 
Mean ppFEV1 was maintained from 2016 through 2018 in the Orkambi overall cohort. Stratification by 
sex or lung function by ppFEV1 categories showed consistent results, apart from patients with ppFEV1 
start of 2016 ≥70 who underwent a mean decline of 1 percentage point per year (1.4 in 2017 and 0.9 
in 2018).  
Importantly, an ad hoc analysis on stratification by age at start (≥ or < 18 years) in Orkambi treated 
patients  with  3-years  exposure  showed,  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  <18  years,  a  mean  decrease 
of -2.1 percentage point in the first year and of -0.66 in the second year. The mean decrease observed 
in subjects ≥18 years was -1.07 in the first year of observation, followed by a mean increase of 1.45 in 
the second year. It is noted that the baseline mean value of ppFEV1 was slightly higher in patients <18 
years of age as compared to those ≥ 18 years.  
The  sensitivity  analysis  that  included  only  subjects  with  continuous  Orkambi  exposure  from  2016  to 
2018, showed: 
-in the overall population a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.15 percentage point in the first year and of 
-0.79 in the second year. 
- in the subgroup of patients <18 years a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.96 percentage point in the 
first  year  and  of-1.47  in  the  second  year.  The  mean  decrease  observed  in  subjects  ≥18  years  was  -
0.93 in the first year of observation and -0.59 in the second year.  
Across  presented  analyses,  the  observed  decline  in  predicted  ppFEV1  (measured  as  decrease  in 
percentage  point)  over  3  years  exposure  was  consistently  higher  in  the  younger  (<18  years)  age 
category as compared to the older one (≥18 years).  
The observed decreases seem slightly lower than the mean -2.29 percentage point per year reported 
in US registry patients homozygous for F508del mutation and untreated with CFTR modulator therapy 
used  as  controls  in  the  matched  analysis  of  the  PROGRESS  Study    (Konstan  M,  McKone  E,  Moss  R, 
Marigowda G, Tian S, Waltz D, et al). Evidence for reduced rate of lung function decline and sustained 
benefit  with  combination  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor  therapy  in  patients  with  CF  homozygous  for  the 
F508del-CFTR mutation. Lancet Respir Med. 2017; 16: S2213-600). However, in these published data 
the results in the subgroup of controls <18 years of age have not been presented separately.  
When  comparing  baseline  characteristics  of  the  455  US  patients  who  were  included  in  the  matched 
registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  2017)  with  patients  enrolled  in  Study  120,  some  differences  are 
observed: ≥12-<18 years: US PROGRESS completers 25.7% vs Study 120 18.8%; ppFEV1 mean (SD) 
at baseline: 59.8 (13.8) vs 66.3 (16.6) percentage points.

CHMP comment 
BMI for age-z score and mean BMI were stable with a slight trend to increase in the overall Orkambi 
cohort as well as in the population stratified by age (≥ or < 20 years). However, it is not clear why the 
cut-off of 20 years was used.

CHMP comment 
In  Study  120,  PEx  was  defined  by  evidence  of  a  CF  care  episode  with  PEx  as  the  reason.  The 
proportion of patients who had ≥1 PEx in the overall Orkambi cohort of patients slightly increased over 
the 3 –year of exposure (from  47.7  in 2016 to 49.5 in 2018).  
Mean number per patient over 3 years exposure slightly reduced (from 0.93 in 2016 to 0.88 in 2018).  
It is highlighted that no analysis of PEx (both as proportion of patients with at least one PEx and PEx 
annualized  event  rate)  is  provided  in  paediatric  patients  aged  ≥12  years.  The  MAH  should  provide 
these analyses.

In Study 105, PEx was defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 
or more of the  followingsigns/symptoms: Change in sputum; New or increased hemoptysis; Increased 
cough;  Increased  dyspnea;  Malaise,  fatigue,  or  lethargy;  Temperature  above  38°C  (equivalent  to 
approximately 100.4°F); Anorexia or weight loss; Sinus pain or tenderness; Change in sinus discharge; 
Change  in  physical  examination  (PE)  of  the  chest;  Decrease  in  pulmonary  function  by  10%;  and 
Radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection. This definition was based on the definition of a 
PEx used in previous clinical studies including IVA clinical studies.

The PEx rate (mean number of PEx per patient: 0.93, 0.85, 0.88 respectively in 2016, 2017 and 2018)  
in Study 120 was higher compared to Study 105 (number of events per patient year: 0.65), however 
due to the different definitions used in the two studies, no definitive conclusion may be drawn. 
Unfortunately,  the  comparison  of  the  rate  of  change  in  annualized  PExs  between  Orkambi  treated 
patients  and  matched  controls  was  not  among  the  outcome  measures  in  the  publication  by  Konstan 
and  co-workers  (Supplementary  material  to  Konstan  et  al.  Lancet  Respir  Med  2016;  published  online 
Dec 20). 
In  Study  120  the  US  registry  definition  was  used,  thus  a  comparison  with  the  untreated  matched 
registry cohort published by Konstan and co-workers should be provided at least for the 3 years follow-
up. 
Hospitalizations:  defined  if  there  was  evidence  of  a  hospitalization  that  occurred  for  any  reason. 
Reasons  for  hospitalization  were  evaluated  as  recorded  in  the  US  CFFPR  database  (e.g.,  PEx, 
infection, 
pulmonary  complication,  gastrointestinal  complication, 
nontransplant surgery, and other).

CHMP comment 
The proportion of patients who had ≥1 hospitalization in the overall Orkambi cohort increased over the 
3 –year of exposure (from 41% in 2016 to 46% in 2018).   
The annualized hospitalization rate over 3 year exposure slightly increased (from 0.79 in 2016 to 0.82 
in  2018).  It  is  highlighted  that  no  analyses  on  hospitalization  are  provided  (both  as  proportion  of 
patients who had ≥1hospitalization and as hospitalization rate) in paediatric patients aged ≥12 years. 
The main reason of hospitalization was PEx.

2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
At  the  time  of  the  initial  Orkambi  approval  in  the  EU,  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  explore  the 
possibility of a longer follow-up (i.e. 5 years) of study population enrolled in the phase 3 study (study 
105)  submitted  in  support  of  the  indication  in  patients  12  years  and  older.  Because  the  majority  of 
subjects had completed Study 105 at the time of this request, the MAH determined that extending this 
study  for  an  additional  3  years  was  not  feasible  and  explored  the  feasibility  of  identifying  and 
evaluating Study 105 participants via existing national CF patient registries in US and EU. 
Based on further assessment of feasibility, evaluated EU registries were considered not suitable for the 
purposes  of  the  study  due  to  various  reasons,  including  low  national  coverage  (e.g.,  Spain,  50), 
significant  data  availability  lags  and/or  data  quality  issues  (e.g.,  Italy;  as  of  2017,  the  most  recent 
data  available  are  from  2014),  or  very  small  Study  105  patient  pool  (e.g.,  UK,  France,  Germany, 
Sweden,  Austria,  and  Denmark).  Because  a  significant  proportion  of  subjects  who  completed  Study 
105 Part A were from the US (N = 485; 53%), the MAH planned to conduct Study 120, following only 
US subjects from Study 105 Part A (patients homozygous for F508del coming from parent studies 103 
and  104)  who  were  also  enrolled  in  the  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  Patient  Registry  (CFFPR)  for  3 
years after the completion of Study 105. Given the limitations of Study 105, the study was considered 
by the MAH to be hypotheses-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. 
The  protocol  for  the  observational  study  120  has  been  considered  acceptable  by  CHMP  in  the  Post-
Authorisation  Measure  REC  10.1,  dated  15  March  2018.  The  concern  initially  raised  that  the  pool  of 
patients  ultimately  available  for  analysis  could  be  small  and  that  the  number  of  analysable  patients 
could not be sufficient to provide a clear and relevant response to the CHMP request, was not pursued 
as  it  was  considered  acceptable  to  supplement  the  data  from  Study  120  with  that  from  PASS  study 
108, to fulfil the CHMP request on additional data on safety and efficacy. Similarly, the initial request to 
discuss the possibility of including a matched control group from the registry was not pursued, as the 
much  larger  PASS  study  108  has  a  large  Orkambi  treated  and  control  arm  that  comprise  the  safety 
cohort from the US registry. 
With this application, the MAH is submitting the final results of Study 120. Out of 485 subjects from US 
who  completed  study  105,  only  roughly  half  (256/485,  53%)  were  included  in  the  Orkambi  Cohort 
Study 120. Thus, patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup (roughly 25%) of 
the patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented 
to participate). 
The number of patients with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in US CFFPR per year ranged between 
5%  and  14%  per  year  during  the  3  years  of  Study  120  registry  follow-up  (31/287,  11%  in  2016; 
13/256, 5% in 2017; 34/239, 14% in 2018). No information is available for these patients as, in the 
study  protocol,  the  MAH  had  pre-specified  that  only  if  an  attrition  greater  than  20%  was  observed, 
available  patient  characteristics  would  have  been  examined  in  order  to  understand  if  there  were 
systematic  differences  related  to  exposure  between  individuals  who  remained  in  the  study  and  those 
who were lost to follow-up.  
When comparing baseline characteristics of the 455/485 US patients included in Study 105, who were 
included in the published analysis with the matched registry cohort (Konstan et al, 2017), these appear 
to partially differ from patients enrolled in Study 120 (% of subjects ≥12-<18 years: 25.7% vs 18.8%; 
mean  ppFEV1  at  baseline:  59.8    vs  66.3  percentage  points,  respectively  in  US  study  105  completers 
compared with subjects participating in Study 120).  
The post-approval commitment requested by the CHMP was to provide data to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of Orkambi treatment over a period of 5 years, whereas the provided follow up is of only 
3 years. For this reason the MAH was requested to complement results on the effectiveness and safety 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 22/23 
 
  
 
 
endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120  (ppFEV1,  BMI  and  weight,  pulmonary  exacerbation,  liver  function 
tests,  hypertension,  organ  transplantation)  with  results on the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the 2 
years  of  Study  105,  in  order  to  have  an  overall  period  of  observation  of  5  years.  The  MAH  was 
requested  to  provide  these  results  both  in  the  overall  Study  120  population  and  separately  in  the 
subgroups <18 years of age and ≥18 years of age.  
Moreover,  given  that  part  of  the  256  US  subjects  included  in  Study  120  are  included  also  in  the 
published analysis of the matched registry cohort the MAH was requested to provide the 5 year follow 
up  of  these  patients  in  comparison  with  their  matched  controls,  according  to  the  same  methodology 
followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow up, the MAH was also 
been  requested  to  provide  the  rate  of  change  in  annualized  Pex  in  Orkambi  treated  patients  and 
matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and 
the US registry used the same definition of Pex. Following the request of supplementary information, 
the MAH stated that the request for matched control analyses using the same methodology followed in 
Konstan  et  al.  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the  approved  protocol  and  would  not  be  feasible  because  a 
sufficient  pool  of  CFTR  modulator  naïve  F/F  patients  cannot  be  identified  during  this  period  to 
appropriately match to study participants in Study 120. Given that in the Final Assessment Report for 
the  Post-Authorisation  Measure  REC  10.1,  dated  15  March  2018,  the  safety  data  generated  from  the 
larger PASS study 108 with an Orkambi treated and a control arm, was considered sufficient to fill in 
the  lacunae  in  information  from  the  absence  of  a  control  group  in  study  120,  the  initial  request  of  a 
matched controlled analysis was not pursued further. 
The  required  results  have  been  provided  by  the  MAH  for  both  overall  Study  120  population  and 
separately  in  adult  and  paediatric  subgroups,  although  in  the  paediatric  setting  results  should  be 
interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (n = 48). 
Similarly  to  what  observed  in  Study  105,  a  trend  towards  a  numerical  decaying  of  effect  on  lung 
function (ppFEV1) with longer treatment duration was observed in Orkambi treated subjects in Study 
120;  however  the  indirect  comparison  with  published  cohorts  of  US  registry  patients  homozygous  for 
F508del mutation untreated with CFTR modulator therapy (Konstan et al, 2017; Wegener et al, 2018), 
seem to indicate a numerically slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in Orkambi treated subjects. 
In Study 120, mean BMI was stable in the overall Orkambi cohort as well as in the subgroups ≥ or < 18 
years.    For  the  paediatric  subgroup  in  Study  105,  BMI-for-age  z-scores  were  negative  but  generally 
improved  throughout  Study  105.  In  Study  120,  in  the  subgroup  <18  years,  there  was  numerically  a 
slight decrease of BMI for age Z scores during Study 120, although with values close to zero. 
In the subgroup of Study 120 paediatric subjects (12-<18 years) the PEx rate seems higher compared 
to Study 105, however due to the different definitions used in the two studies, no conclusion may be 
drawn. The proportion of patients who had ≥1 hospitalization in the Study 120 overall Orkambi cohort 
slightly  increased over  the  3  –year  of  exposure  (from  41%    in  2016 to  46%  in  2018),  as  well  as  the 
annualized hospitalization rate (from 0.79 in 2016 to 0.82 in 2018), with PEx being the main reason of 
hospitalization (>90%). 
Overall,  the  trends  observed  in  safety  endpoints  in  Study  120  were  consistent  with  the  safety  profile 
described in study 105. 
Given  that  patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  subgroup  (roughly  25%)  of  the 
patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to 
participate),  the  comparison  between  Study  120  and  Study  105  results  is  subject  to  limitations.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  due  to  the  differences  in  data  collection  and  endpoint  definitions,  it  may  not  be 
appropriate to combine the clinical data from Study 105 and the registry-based data from Study 120 or 
directly compare the reported values for each endpoint. For these reasons, even though the MAH has 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 23/24 
 
  
 
 
not  provided  the  results  of  the  two  years  of  treatment  in  Study  105  separately  for  the  subset  of 
patients enrolled in Study 120, the issue was not further pursued. 
In  the  3rd  interim  analysis  from  the  ongoing  PASS  (Study  108,  a  5-year  long-term  observational 
study),  results  from  the  comparative  safety  analysis  from  the  US  CFFPR  generally  favoured  the 
Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  over  the  Comparator  Safety  Cohort.  The  4th  interim  analysis  report  of  the 
ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide additional data on the long-term effects 
of Orkambi, including subgroups of adult and paediatric patients. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The  MAH  provided  the  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120. 
However, interpretation of Study 120 results are hampered by the limited number of patients enrolled 
(only a roughly 25% of the patient population enrolled in study 105 were enrolled in Study 120) and  
the comparison between data from Study 120 (clinical study) and Study 105 (registry-based data) is 
subject to limitations, also due to differences in data collection and endpoint definitions. Moreover, the 
paediatric  subgroup  results  for  Study  120  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  small 
sample size (n = 48). 
Although  a  trend  towards  a  numerical  decaying  of  effect  on  lung  function  (ppFEV1)  with  longer 
treatment  duration  was  observed  in  Orkambi  treated  subjects  in  Study  120,  the  indirect  comparison 
with published cohorts of US registry patients homozygous for F508del mutation untreated with CFTR 
modulator therapy provides some reassurance  indicating a slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline.  
Overall  trends  observed  in  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  in  Study  120  were  consistent  with 
those in Study 105.  
The 4th interim analysis report of the ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide 
additional  data  on  the  long-term  effects  of  Orkambi,  including  subgroups  of  adult  and  paediatric 
patients. 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure: 
1)  Patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  proportion  of  the  patient  population 
enrolled  in  study  105,  and  the  external  validity  of  study  results  appears  questionable  and  should  be 
further discussed by the MAH.  
2)  The  post-approval  commitment  requested  by  the  CHMP  was  to  provide  data  to  evaluate  of  the 
safety  and  effectiveness  of  Orkambi  treatment  over  a  period of  5  years,  whereas  the provided  follow 
up  is  of  only  3  years.  Results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 
(ppFEV1,  BMI  and  weight,  pulmonary  exacerbation,  liver  function  tests,  hypertension,  organ 
transplantation)  should  be  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2 
years of Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years. The MAH is requested 
to provide these results both in the overall Study 120 population and separately in the subgroups <18 
years of age and ≥18 years of age. 
3)  Given  that  part  of  the  256  US  subjects  included  in  Study  120  are  included  also  in  the  published 
analysis  of  the  matched  registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  Lancet  Resp  Med  2017),  the  MAH  should 
provide the 5 year follow up of these patients in comparison with their matched controls, according to 
the same methodology followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow 
up, the MAH should also provide the rate of change in annualized PEx in Orkambi treated patients and 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 24/25 
 
  
 
 
matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and 
the US registry used the same definition of PEx.  
MAH responses to the 1st Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
Patients included in study 120 represent only a selected proportion of the patient population enrolled in 
study  105,  and  the  external  validity  of  study  results  appears  questionable  and  should  be  further 
discussed by the MAH.  
MAH’s Response 
Vertex  acknowledges  that  the  Study  120  population  includes only  the  subset of  Study  VX12-809-105 
(Study  105)  participants  enrolled  in  the  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  Patient  Registry  (CFFPR)  who 
provided consent. The Study 120 protocol was designed with input from the CHMP; the final protocol 
was  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  (see  Final  Assessment  Report  for  the  Post-Authorisation 
Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018 and hereafter referred to as “Assessment Report REC 10.1”). 
During  the  assessment  of  the  protocol,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  only  a  subset  of  subjects  from 
Study 105 would enroll in Study 120, that Study 120 would be descriptive only, and that data from the 
large  postauthorization  safety  study  (PASS)  VX14-809-108  (Study  108)  could  be  used  to  supplement 
Study 120 data and would be acceptable to fulfill the CHMP’s request for additional safety and efficacy 
data. 
Vertex  believes  that the  Rapporteur’s  concerns  regarding the  external  validity  of  results  of  this  study 
are mitigated by the following: 
•  The  US  registry-based  approach  identified  and  evaluated  a  significant  proportion  of  the  subjects  in 
the US, which was the country with the largest subpopulation of Study 105 subjects. 
• The phenotype and clinical course of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the F508del homozygous (F/F) population 
does  not  substantially  differ  by  geographic  region;  therefore,  data  from  the  US  patient  population 
captured by the US CFFPR are appropriate for assessing long-term safety and efficacy, and trends can 
be extrapolated for all global regions. 
• The trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 105. 
•  The  results  from  Study  120  are  consistent  with  the  results  from  other  studies  evaluating  the  long-
term effects of Orkambi therapy, including the ongoing 5-year PASS (Study 108), a much larger real-
world  comparator-controlled  study.  In  the  3rd  interim  analysis  report  for  the  PASS  (Study  108) 
submitted 26 November 2019, key clinical outcomes of 4,628 F/F patients in the Orkambi® Cohort are 
compared  to  5,666  patients  heterozygous  for  F508del  in  the  Comparator  Cohort,  with  results  that 
support the current benefit-risk profile of Orkambi. 
Based on the above, Vertex concludes that, although the Study 120 population represents a selected 
proportion of the Study 105 subjects, the consistency of the results with clinical and real-world studies 
minimizes  concerns  regarding  the  external  validity  of  the  results.  Vertex  is  committed  to  continue 
evaluating the long-term effects of Orkambi in the ongoing PASS (Study 108); the Study 108 data can 
be used to supplement Study 120 data, as endorsed by the CHMP in the Assessment Report REC 10.1. 
Furthermore,  additional  efficacy  data  will  be  obtained  from  a  post-authorization  efficacy  study  VX18-
809-128,  which  was 
requested  by 
the  EMA  as  part  of 
the  approval  of  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G  (Vertex  submitted  the  protocol  for  Scientific  Advice  in  procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/1448/6/2019/PED/II and intends to submit the protocol to the EMA in Q2 2020).

The  MAH  emphasizes  that  the  final  protocol  was  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  (see  Final 
Assessment  Report  for  the  Post-Authorisation  Measure  REC  10.1,  dated  15  March  2018).  During  the 
assessment  of  the  protocol,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  only  a  subset  of  subjects  from  Study  105 
would enrol in Study 120, that Study 120 would be descriptive only, and that data from the large post 
authorization safety study (PASS) VX14-809-108 (Study 108) could be used to supplement Study 120 
data and would be acceptable to fulfill the CHMP’s request for additional safety and efficacy data. 
The MAH’s opinion is that, although the Study 120 population represents a selected proportion of the 
Study 105 subjects, the trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 
105  and  the  results  from  Study  120  are  consistent with  the  3rd  interim  analysis  report  for  the  PASS 
(Study 108) submitted 26 November 2019; in the MAH’s opinion consistency of the results with clinical 
and real-world studies minimizes concerns regarding the external validity of the results.  
The MAH will continue evaluating the long-term effects of Orkambi in the ongoing PASS (Study 108). 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  emphasizes  that  additional  efficacy  data  will  be  obtained  from  a  post-
authorization efficacy study VX18-809-128, for patients 2- to 5-years-old at initiation of Orkambi. 
It is acknowledged that in the Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, 
dated  15  March  2018,  the  concern  initially  raised  that  the  pool  of  patients  ultimately  available  for 
analysis could be small and that the number of analysable patients could not be sufficient to provide a 
clear and relevant response to the CHMP request, was not pursued as it was considered acceptable to 
supplement  the  data  from  Study  120  with  that  from  PASS  study  108,  to  fulfil  the  CHMP  request  on 
additional data on safety and efficacy.  
Patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup of the patient population enrolled in 
study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to participate). 
The  MAH’s  opinion  that,  although  the  Study  120  population  represents  a  selected  proportion  of  the 
Study 105 subjects, the trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 
105  is  not  agreed.  As  further  discussed  in  the  assessment  of  the  response  to  question  2,  given  that 
only  53%  of  subjects  who  completed  study  105  were  from  US,  and  given  that    out  of  485  subjects 
from  US  who  completed  study  105,  only  roughly  half  were  included  in  Study  120  (256  in  the  2016; 
239  in  the  2017;  202  in  the  2018),  it  is  not  considered  appropriate  to  compare  the  overall  2  year 
results of Study 105 with the 3 year follow up in Study 120. Please refer to assessment of Question 2 
for further aspects on this issue. 
Question 2 
The post-approval commitment requested by the CHMP was to provide data to evaluate of the safety 
and effectiveness of Orkambi treatment over a period of 5 years, whereas the provided follow up is of 
only 3 years. Results on the effectiveness and safety endpoints evaluated in Study 120 (ppFEV1, BMI 
and weight, pulmonary exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation) should 
be  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2  years  of  Study  105,  in 
order  to  have  an  overall  period  of  observation  of  5  years.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  these 
results both in the overall Study 120 population and separately in the subgroups <18 years of age and 
≥18 years of age. 
MAH’s Response 
Vertex clarifies that, according to the approved protocol, Study 120 follows subjects of Study 105 for 
an additional 3 years following the conclusion of Study 105. While the focus of the results in Study 120 
is on the most recent 3-year follow-up period, these subjects were exposed to Orkambi for a total of 5 
years  or  longer  because  they  initiated  treatment  in clinical  Study  105  or one of  the  2  feeder  studies, 
Study  VX12-809-103  or  Study  VX12-809-104.  During  the  assessment  of  the  protocol  (Assessment 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 26/27 
 
  
 
 
Report  REC  10.1),  the  CHMP  confirmed  that  it  would  be  acceptable  for  trends  over  5  years  to  be 
described in the final clinical study report for Study 120, including a discussion of relevant data from 
the previously completed 2-year Study 105 and the summary of results of the 3-year  follow-up after 
Study  105  obtained  via  the  US  CFFPR.  This  information  was  provided in  the Study  120  CSR/Sections 
8.2 and 13.1. 
Due to the important differences in the data collection and definitions of the clinical outcomes during 
the periods of participation in Study 105 and subsequent real-world registry-based Study 120, it is not 
appropriate  to  combine  the  datasets  or  to  perform  a  direct  comparison  of  outcomes  between  the 
periods (e.g., to compare the clinical study and the real-world registry based follow-up period). The US 
CFFPR  data  from  Study  120  are  observational  in  nature,  collected  over  the  course  of  routine  care 
without  scheduled  visit  intervals  or  standardized  assessments.  In  contrast,  Study  105  data  were 
collected under the rigorous standards for clinical study data collection, including predefined intervals 
between  assessments,  standardized  measurements  and  procedures,  and  standardized  definitions  of 
clinical  outcomes/endpoints.  The  differences  in  clinical  outcome  definition  are  exemplified  by  the 
definitions  for  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PEx).  The  US  CFFPR  defines  PEx  as  an  episode  requiring 
intravenous antibiotic use at home or in the hospital. However, PEx in Study 105 was strictly defined 
by criteria standardized across Vertex CF clinical studiesa, where most of these criteria are based upon 
assessments  that  are  not  captured  in  registry  data  (e.g.,  change  in  sputum  and  change  in  sinus 
discharge). 
While the Study 120 data cannot be combined with Study 105 data due to these critical differences in 
data collection, the trends observed for the clinical outcomes during the 3-year follow-up in Study 120 
are  nonetheless  consistent  with  those  observed  from  the  2-year  follow-up  in  Study  105.  Specifically, 
the  effectiveness  outcomes  in  subjects  in  Study  120  demonstrated  overall  stable  trends  in  percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1), body mass index (BMI) values, annual risk 
of  PEx,  annualized  PEx  rate,  and  annualized  rate  of  hospitalizations,  which  was  consistent  with  the 
long-term maintenance of the treatment effect demonstrated in Study 105 for the relevant endpoints. 
In  addition,  no  new  safety  concerns  or  trends,  including  elevated  alanine  transaminase  or  aspartate 
transaminase  values,  were  identified  in  Study  120,  and  low  rates  of  death  and  lung  transplantation 
were observed. 
a In Study 105, PEx was defined as a new, or change in, antibiotic therapy (intravenous, inhaled, or 
oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs/symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased 
hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnea; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 
38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change 
in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 
10%; and radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection. 
Assessment of the MAH’s Response 
The  MAH  states  that  due  to  the  important  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the 
clinical  outcomes  during  the  periods  of  participation  in  Study  105  (data  collected  under  the  rigorous 
standards  for  clinical  study  data  collection)  and  subsequent  real-world  registry-based  Study  120 
(observational  data,  collected  over  the  course  of  routine  care  without  scheduled  visit  intervals  or 
standardized  assessments),  it  is  not  appropriate  to  combine  the  datasets  or  to  perform  a  direct 
comparison  of  outcomes  between  the  periods  (e.g.,  to  compare  the  clinical  study  and  the  real-world 
registry based follow-up period).  
Furthermore, the MAH’s opinion is that while the Study 120 data cannot be combined with Study 105 
data  due  to  these  critical differences  in  data  collection,  the  trends  observed  for  the  clinical  outcomes 
during the 3-year follow-up in Study 120 are nonetheless consistent with those observed from the 2-
year follow-up in Study 105. Specifically, the MAH states that the effectiveness outcomes in subjects in 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 27/28 
 
  
 
 
Study  120  demonstrated  overall  stable  trends  in  percent  predicted  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1 
second  (ppFEV1),  body  mass  index  (BMI)  values,  annual  risk  of  PEx,  annualized  PEx  rate,  and 
annualized  rate  of  hospitalizations,  which  was  consistent  with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the 
treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105  for  the  relevant  endpoints.  In  addition,  no  new  safety 
concerns were identified in Study 120. 
During  the  assessment  of  the  protocol  (Assessment  Report  REC  10.1),  the  MAH  was  requested  to 
confirm that trends over 5 years will be described i.e. the relevant data from the two-year study 105 
will  also  be  included  in  the  description  of  long  term  safety  and  efficacy  and  the  MAH  confirmed  that 
trends  over  5  years  will  be  described  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  Study  120,  including  a 
discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105. 
In  Study  105,  although  the  efficacy  seemed  to  be  sustained  during  the  initial  24  weeks,  a  trend  of 
decaying  beyond  Week  24  was  observed:  for  subjects  who  received  active  treatment  in  both  Study 
103/104  and  Study  105,  the  improvements  in  ppFEV1  from  previous  study  baseline  during  Study 
103/104  were  generally  sustained  in  Study  105  up  to  Extension  Week  36  for  L600qd/I  group  and 
Extension  Week  24  for  L400q12h/I  group.    The  improvement  in  ppFEV1  decreased  over  time  in  both 
groups  with  small/no  improvement  in  ppFEV1  at  Extension  Week  96.  The  least  square  (LS)  mean 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for the L400q12h/I group (the authorized dose for this age 
group) was 1.6 percentage points (P = 0.0012) at Week 60; at Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result 
was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment statistical significance (P = 0.2806). 
The  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the  clinical  outcomes  during  the  periods  of 
participation  in  Study  105  (clinical  study  data)  and in  Study  120  (real-world  registry-based  data)  are 
known  limitations  of  the  protocol  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  order  to  fulfil  the  post-authorization 
commitment.  Nevertheless,  in  the  Final  Assessment  Report  REC  10.1,  the  MAH  has  confirmed  that 
trends  over  5  years  will  be  described  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  Study  120,  including  a 
discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105.  
In  Study  105,  although  the  efficacy  seemed  to  be  sustained  during  the  initial  24  weeks,  a  trend  of 
decaying beyond Week 24 was observed with small/no improvement in ppFEV1 at Extension Week 96. 
At Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment 
statistical  significance  (P  =  0.2806)  (see  CHMP  AR  EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0017).  Given  that  only  53% 
of subjects who completed study 105 were from US, and given that  out of 485 subjects from US who 
completed study 105, only roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in the 2016; 239 in the 2017; 
202 in the 2018), it is not considered appropriate to compare the overall 2 year results of Study 105 
with the 3 year follow up in Study 120. The issue is not resolved.  
The  request  to  provide  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 
(ppFEV1,  BMI  and  weight,  pulmonary  exacerbation,  liver  function  tests,  hypertension,  organ 
transplantation)  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2  years  of 
Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years is reiterated. Also, the request 
to  provide  these  results  both  in  the  overall  population  and  separately  in  the  subgroups  <18  years  of 
age and ≥18 years of age is reiterated. 
Question 3 
Given  that  part  of  the  256  US  subjects  included  in  Study  120  are  included  also  in  the  published 
analysis  of  the  matched  registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  Lancet  Resp  Med  2017),  the  MAH  should 
provide the 5 year follow up of these patients in comparison with their matched controls, according to 
the same methodology followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow 
up, the MAH should also provide the rate of change in annualized PEx in Orkambi treated patients and 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 28/29 
 
  
 
 
matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and 
the US registry used the same definition of PEx.  
MAH’s response 
In accordance with the Assessment Report REC 10.1, Study 120 was designed as a single-arm study 
without a comparator group. Given the limitations of the design elements for Study 120, data from the 
ongoing PASS (Study 108) is provided as a supplement to the Study 120 analyses to provide additional 
data  in  the  assessment  of  long-term  outcomes  of  Orkambi.  This  approach  is  also  in  accordance  with 
the Assessment Report REC 10.1. 
Vertex acknowledges the additional request for matched control analyses using the same methodology 
followed  in  Konstan  et  al.1  but  would  like  to  clarify  that  such  analyses  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the 
approved protocol and would not be feasible due to the following: 
•  The  matched  control  analyses  described  in  Konstan  et  al.  were  performed  before  approval  and 
commercialization  of  Orkambi  in  the  US,  thus  the  authors  were  able  to  evaluate  a  large  pool  of  F/F 
patients who were naïve to CFTR modulators, specifically Orkambi. 
•  Study  120  focuses on the  3-year  period  predominantly  following  approval and  commercialization  of 
Orkambi,  and,  subsequently,  Symdeko®  in  the  US  (2016  through  2018);  thus,  a  sufficient  pool  of 
CFTR  modulator  naïve  F/F  patients  cannot  be  identified  during  this  period  to  appropriately  match  to 
study participants in Study 120. 
Although  additional  matched  control  analyses  would  not  be  possible,  the  patterns  observed  in  Study 
120  are  favorable  in the  context  of  natural  history  of  these  outcomes  among patients untreated  with 
CFTR modulators. Specifically, in Konstan et al.,1 the rate of lung function decline among US registry 
F/F patients who were untreated with CFTR modulator therapy was 2.29 percentage points per year. In 
Study 120, lung function remained relatively stable over the course of the 3-year follow-up. Similarly, 
in  a  real-world  registry-based  study  of  disease  progression  among  patients  treated  with  ivacaftor 
(Kalydeco Long-term Safety Study),2 a comparator cohort of patients untreated with CFTR modulators 
had an increasing annual proportion of patients with ≥1 PEx and increasing annualized PEx event rate 
over time. In Study 120, both the annual proportion of patients with ≥1 PEx and annualized PEx event 
rate were relatively stable over the course of the 3 years following completion of Study 105. 
In  summary,  single  cohort  data  for  Study  120  and  comparative  cohort  data  from  the  ongoing  long-
term PASS (Study 108) are complementary and sufficient to evaluate the long-term effects of Orkambi 
therapy under the real-world conditions of use and are in accordance with the Assessment Report REC 
10.1.  In  addition,  the  trends  in  efficacy  outcomes  in  Study  120  remain  favorable  when  compared  to 
other  comparator  cohort  data  from  patients  untreated  with  CFTR  modulators  in  previously  published 
studies.1, 2

The MAH states that the request for matched control analyses using the same methodology followed in 
Konstan  et  al.  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the  approved  protocol  and  would  not  be  feasible  because  a 
sufficient  pool  of  CFTR  modulator  naïve  F/F  patients  cannot  be  identified  during  this  period  to 
appropriately match to study participants in Study 120. 
Furthermore, the MAH states that the patterns observed in Study 120 are favourable in the context of 
natural  history  of  these  outcomes  among  patients  untreated  with  CFTR  modulators  (Konstan  et  al, 
2017; Volkova et al 2020). 
Even  though  in  the  assessors  opinion  the  previously  requested  matched  control  analysis  would  have 
allowed to better assess changes in efficacy over time, it is acknowledged that the issue of the absence 
of a matched control group from the registry, initially raised as a concern to the proposed protocol for 
this  study,  was  not  pursued  in  the  Final  Assessment  Report  for  the  Post-Authorisation  Measure  REC 
10.1, dated 15 March 2018, on the basis of the argumentation that the safety data generated from the 
larger PASS study 108 with an Orkambi treated and a control arm, was considered sufficient to fill in 
the lacunae in information from the absence of a control group in study 120. 
The issue is not pursued further. 
2nd Request for supplementary information 
The  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the  clinical  outcomes  during  the  periods  of 
participation  in  Study  105  (clinical  study  data)  and in  Study  120  (real-world  registry-based  data)  are 
known  limitations  of  the  protocol  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  order  to  fulfil  the  post-authorization 
commitment. Nevertheless, in the Final Assessment Report REC 10.1, the applicant has confirmed that 
that  trends  over  5  years  will  be  described  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  Study  120,  including  a 
discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105.  
In  Study  105,  although  the  efficacy  seemed  to  be  sustained  during  the  initial  24  weeks,  a  trend  of 
decaying beyond Week 24 was observed with small/no improvement in ppFEV1 at Extension Week 96. 
At Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment 
statistical significance (P = 0.2806). 
Given  that  only  53%  of  subjects  who  completed  study  105  were  from  US,  and  given  that  out  of  485 
subjects from US who completed study 105, only roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in the 
2016;  239  in  the  2017;  202  in  the  2018),  it  is  not  considered  appropriate  to  compare  the  overall  2 
year results of Study 105 with the 3 year follow up in Study 120.  
The  request  to  provide  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 
(ppFEV1,  BMI  and  weight,  pulmonary  exacerbation,  liver  function  tests,  hypertension,  organ 
transplantation)  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2  years  of 
Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years is reiterated. Also the request

age and ≥18 years of age is reiterated. 
MAH response to 2nd Request for supplementary information 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As  requested,  Vertex  is  providing  the  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in 
Study  120,  complemented  with  the  results  on  the  same  endpoints  observed  in  Study  105.  The 
requested effectiveness and safety endpoints include: percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second  (ppFEV1),  body  mass  index  (BMI)  and  weight,  pulmonary  exacerbations  (PEx),  liver  function 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 30/31 
 
  
 
 
tests  (LFTs),  hypertension,  and  organ  transplantation.  In  addition,  results  are  also  provided  for  the 
pediatric (12 to <18 years of age) and adult subgroups (≥18 years of age) for both studies. A complete 
list  of  the  tables  summarizing  the  pediatric  and  adult  subgroup  data  is  provided  in  Appendix  1  for 
Study 105 and in Appendix 2 for Study 120. 
Overall,  the  trends  observed  in  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  in  Study  120  were  consistent 
with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the  treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105,  in  the  overall 
population as well as pediatric and adult subgroups. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  due  to  the  critical  differences  between  interventional  clinical  studies  and 
observational studies, these results should be interpreted with caution. These differences include data 
collection  methodology,  the  nature  of  the  collected  data,  and  the  endpoint  definitions.  For  example, 
Study 105 data were collected under the rigorous standards for clinical study data collection, including 
predefined  intervals  between  assessments,  standardized  measurements  and  procedures,  and 
standardized definitions of clinical outcomes/endpoints. In contrast, Study 120 data was observational 
in  nature,  collected  over  the  course  of  routine  care  without  scheduled  visit  intervals  or  standardized 
assessments.  Differences  in  endpoint  definitions  (e.g.,  PEx)  between  the  studies  are  discussed  in 
further  detail  below.  Given  these  limitations,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  combine  the  clinical  data  from 
Study  105  and  the  registry-based  data  from  Study  120  or  directly  compare  the  reported  values  for 
each  endpoint.  Instead  of  comparing  specific  values,  directional  consistency  of  outcomes  should  be 
evaluated. In addition, the pediatric subgroup results for Study 120 should be interpreted with caution 
because of the small sample size (n = 48). 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
A  summary  of  the  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  overall  population  and  pediatric 
subgroups in Study 105 and Study 120 are summarized in Table 11.  
The  overall  distribution  of  patients  by  sex  and  race  are  similar  between  the  overall  population  and 
pediatric  subgroups  for  both  Study  105  and  Study  120.  The  baseline  age  (mean  and  range)  for  both 
the overall population and pediatric subgroups was higher in Study 120 than in Study 105, which was 
expected  because  the  baseline  year  for  Study  120  was  2016,  approximately  2.5  years  after  the 
baseline of Study 105 (Study 103/104 baseline). Mean ppFEV1 at baseline for the pediatric subgroup 
was higher than that of the overall population for both Studies 105 and 120, which was consistent with 
the expected lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients of this age group.

improvements in ppFEV1 observed in Study 103/104 were generally sustained during the additional 96 
weeks of treatment in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in Study 103/104, improvements 
in ppFEV1 upon receiving LUM/IVA in Study 105 were similar to those observed for the LUM/IVA group 
in Study 103/104 and were generally sustained throughout Study 105. At Study 105 Week 96, ppFEV1 
was above baseline for all treatment groups (Study 105 CSR/ Table 14.2.1.1a). Data from Study 120 
showed  that  ppFEV1  remained  generally  stable  over  the  subsequent  3  years  for  a  subset  of 
participating Study 105 subjects (Figure 1).

Subgroup Analysis 
The  ppFEV1  results  for  the  adult  subgroup  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  (US  CFF  [Age  ≥18])  were 
consistent  with  the  trends  observed  for  the  overall  population  for  each  study.  The  trends  in  ppFEV1 
observed in the adult subgroup over the 2-year Study 105 and over the subsequent 3 years of follow-
up in Study 120 were consistent with those observed in the overall population. The ppFEV1 results for 
the  pediatric  subgroup  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  (US  CFF  [Age  <18])  were  consistent  with  the 
trends  observed  for  the  overall  population  for  each  study.  Mean  ppFEV1  at  baseline  for  the  pediatric 
subgroup was higher than that of the overall population for both studies, which was consistent with the 
expected  lung  function  in  CF  patients  of  this  age  group.  In  the  pediatric  subgroup,  ppFEV1 
improvements  from  baseline  were  observed  and  generally  sustained  in  Study  105.  Over  the  3-year 
follow-up  in  Study  120,  a  numerical  decrease  in  ppFEV1  was  observed,  which  was  not  statistically 
significant as illustrated by the wide and overlapping standard error bars (Figure 6).

It  is  important  to  interpret  the  results  observed  in  this  small  paediatric  subgroup  in  context  of  the 
greater  expected  rate  of  lung  function  decline  in  the  absence  of  CFTR  modulator  treatment.  For 
instance,  based  on  the  analysis  of  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  (CFF)  registry  data,  the  annualized 
rate of lung function decline in patients homozygous for F508del and 13 through 17 years of age not 
treated  with  a  CFTR  modulator  has  been  previously  estimated  at  -2.66  percentage  points  per  year 
(Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros.  2018;17(4):503-10).  However,  in  the  Study  120  paediatric  subgroup, 
the  absolute  change  in  ppFEV1  was  smaller  at  approximately  -1.4  percentage  points  per  year,  which 
supports a lower rate of lung function decline. 
Furthermore, additional support for a lower rate of lung function decline with Orkambi treatment was 
observed in the 3rd interim analysis of the ongoing comparator-controlled Orkambi post-authorization 
safety study (PASS; Study 108 Interim Analysis Report 3 [IA3]), which showed that in the subgroup of 
patients 12 to <18 years of age at the time of Orkambi initiation who remained on treatment through 
2018 (n = 716), lung function change over 4 years (from pre-treatment baseline year 2014 to 2018) 
was -3.84 percentage points (approximately -1.0 percentage point per year) versus -7.62 percentage 
points (approximately -1.9 percentage points per year) in the untreated comparator patients (n = 803) 
(Study 108 IA3/Table 2.1). 
Overall, the patterns observed in Study 120 and the PASS are consistent with the previously published 
rate of lung function decline analysis in Orkambi-treated patients 12 years of age and older (Konstan 
et  al.).  This  analysis  was  performed  using  propensity  scores  and  matching  a  subset  of  Study  105 
subjects  (n  =  455)  with  US  CFF  Patient  Registry  control  patients  (n  =  1,588)  who  were  not  treated 
with a CFTR modulator. The estimated annualized rate of lung function decline was -1.33 percentage 
points  in  the  Orkambi-treated  group,  which  was  significantly  less  than  the  rate  in  matched  controls 
(-2.29  percentage  points,  probability  [P]<  0.001).  This  represents  a  42%  decrease  in  the  rate  of 
ppFEV1 decline in LUM/IVA-treated patients compared with matched controls. 
Weight 
Overall Analysis 
For  subjects  in  Study  105  who  received  LUM/IVA  in  Study  103/104,  weight  remained  above  baseline 
and  generally  continued  to  improve  at  all  visits  in  Study  105.  For  subjects  who  received  placebo  in 
Study  103/104,  weight  improved  upon  initiating  LUM/IVA  treatment  and  generally  continued  to 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 38/39 
 
  
 
 
 
improve  throughout  Study  105.  Over  the  additional 3-  year  follow-up in  Study  120,  weight  remained 
stable. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Improvements in weight were observed in the adult and pediatric subgroups for both Studies 105 and 
120,  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  overall  population.  Specifically,  improvements  in  weight  were 
seen  throughout  Study  105.  Similar  trends  of  increased  weight  were  observed  over  the  additional  3-
year follow-up in Study 120.

BMI 
Overall Analysis 
The  trends  observed  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  for  the  overall  population  was  similar  to  those 
observed  for  weight.  BMI  increased  at  treatment  initiation  and  continued  to  improve  in  Study  105. 
Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, BMI remained stable.

BMI-for-age Z-score 
Overall Analysis 
For both Studies 105 and 120, BMI-for-age z-score was analyzed only in subjects/patients <20 years 
of age. For subjects in Study 105 who received LUM/IVA in Study 103/104, improvements observed in 
the parent studies were generally sustained in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in Study 
103/104,  BMI-for-age  z-score  improved  upon  initiating  LUM/IVA  through  Week  36,  and  generally 
stabilized thereafter. Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, BMI-for-age z-score in patients 
<20 years of age remained stable. 
Subgroup Analysis 
For  the  pediatric  subgroup  in  Study  105,  BMI-for-age  z-scores  were  negative but  generally  improved 
throughout Study 105. BMI-for-age z-scores were generally stable in Study 120 with values close to 0 
(US CFF [Age <18].

PEx 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  definitions  of  the  PEx-related  endpoints  for  Studies  105  and  120  are 
different. The US CFFPR defines PEx as an episode requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic use at home or 
in the hospital. However, PEx in Study 105 was strictly defined by criteria standardized across Vertex 
CF clinical studies, where most of these criteria are based upon assessments that are not captured in 
registry data (e.g., change in sputum and change in sinus discharge). 
Overall Analysis 
In Study 105, the annualized event rate of PEx for  subjects who received LUM/IVA in Study 103/104 
was  lower  than  that  for  the  placebo  group  in  Study  103/104.  For  subjects  who  received  placebo  in 
Study  103/104,  the  annualized  event  rate  of  PEx  had  a  similar  event  rate  as  was  observed  by  the 
LUM/IVA  group  in  Study  103/104.  Over  the  additional  3-year  follow-up  in  Study  120,  the  annualized 
event rate of PEx was stable over the 3-year study duration. 
Subgroup Analysis 
The  trends  observed  for  the  adult  subgroup  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  (US  CFF  [Age  ≥18])  were 
consistent with the trends observed for the overall population in Study 105 and over the additional 3-
year follow-up in Study 120. For the pediatric subgroup in Study 105, the annualized event rate ranged 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 42/43 
 
  
 
 
 
between  0.56  and  0.75  across  the  treatment  groups.  For  the  pediatric  subgroup  in  Study  120,  the 
event rates were generally stable over the 3-year study duration, and were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.38), 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.29) and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.57) in 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively (US 
CFF [Age <18). These results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size (n = 43 
to 48) as well as differences in the PEx definitions between the clinical study and registry data.

LFTs 
Overall Analysis 
In  Study  105,  the  incidence  of  subjects  with  LFT  elevations  (including  alanine  transaminase  [ALT], 
aspartate transaminase [AST], and bilirubin) that met threshold criteria was low and similar across all 
treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  elevated  transaminase  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity, 
non-serious,  and  did  not  lead  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  Over  the  additional  3-year  follow-up  in 
Study 120, the frequency of patients with any ALT, AST, or bilirubin value exceeding the threshold of 
>3,  >5,  and  >8  ×  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  was  low.  There  were  no  discernible  trends  in  LFTs 
exceeding the prespecified threshold of ULN over time. 
Subgroup Analysis 
The incidence of subjects with LFT elevations in the adult and pediatric subgroups of Study 105, was 
also low and similar across treatment groups (Ad Hoc Table 4.1.3.4.3.2a). Over the 3-year follow-up in 
Study 120, the prevalence of patients with any elevated LFTs was low in both subgroups: ≤3.3% in the

Page 45/46 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
adult  subgroup  (US  CFF  [Age  ≥18]  Table  8.0)  and  only  1  patient  in  the  pediatric  subgroup  had  an 
elevated LFT (ALT >5 × ULN; US CFF [Age <18]).

Hypertension 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  definitions  of  the  hypertension  events  for  Studies  105  and  120  are 
different. In Study 105, incident hypertension events were reported as adverse events (AEs), while in 
Study 120 prevalent events of hypertension are captured in the registry (i.e., includes incident and any 
pre-existing hypertension). 
Overall Analysis 
In  Study  105,  12  (1.2%)  subjects  had  AEs  of  hypertension.  The  majority  of  events  were  mild  to 
moderate in severity, non-serious, and not assessed as related or possibly related to the study drug. 
Over  the  3-year  follow-up  in  Study  120,  the  prevalence  of  hypertension  was  low  ( ≤ 5%)  with  no 
discernible pattern. 
Subgroup Analysis 
In the adult subgroup, 11 (1.5%) subjects had an AE of hypertension in Study 105; the incidence was 
low and similar across all treatment groups. In Study 120, the prevalence of patients with a record of 
hypertension was low (4.8 to ≤6.3%) over the 3-year follow-up (US CFF [Age ≥18]). 
In  the  pediatric  subgroup,  only  1  (0.4%)  subject  had  an  AE  of  hypertension  in  Study  105  and  no 
patients had a record of hypertension in Study 120 (US CFF [Age <18]). 
Organ Transplants 
Overall Analysis 
There were no organ transplants reported during Study 105). Over the 3-year follow-up in Study 120, 
2 (0.78%) out of the 256 patients had a record of lung transplants; 1 in 2016 and 1 in 2017.

Subgroup Analysis 
There were no organ transplants in the pediatric subgroup for Study 105 or Study 120 (US CFF [Age 
<18]). 
Summary 
Overall,  the  trends  observed  in  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  in  Study  120  were  consistent 
with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105,  in  the  overall 
population as well as pediatric and adult subgroups. 
Additional data from PASS Study 108 
Importantly,  the  results  from  the  ongoing  PASS,  a  much  larger,  comparator-controlled  real-world 
study, provides additional data to evaluate the long-term effects of Orkambi. Data from the 3rd annual 
interim analysis (submitted 26 November 2019) included 4,628 patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort 
and  5,666  patients  in  the  Comparator  Safety  Cohort.  Key  results  in  Orkambi  treated  for  the  same 
efficacy and safety outcomes are discussed further below: 
•  ppFEV1:  A  smaller  decline  in  lung  function  over  4  years  was  observed  in  the  Orkambi  Disease 
Progression Cohort (n = 2,287) compared to the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (n = 3,527) 
(Study  108 IA3/Figure  5).  In  subgroup  analysis,  the  same  trend  was  observed  in  patients  12  to  <18 
years of age (Orkambi Disease Progression Cohort: n = 773; Comparator Disease Progression Cohort: 
n = 845; Study 108 IA3). 
• BMI: Among patients ≥18 years of age, a greater increase in mean BMI was observed from 2014 to 
2018  in  the  Orkambi  Disease  Progression  Cohort  than  in  the  Comparator  Disease  Progression  Cohort 
(Study  108  IA3/US  2018  Objective  3).  Among  patients  <18  years  of  age,  mean  BMI  percentile 
increased  from  2014  to  2018  in  the  Orkambi  Disease  Progression  Cohort  whilst  decreasing  in  the 
Comparator Disease Progression Cohort. 
• PEx: From 2014 to 2018, the annual proportion of patients with PEx and the annualized PEx rate per 
patient were stable for patients receiving Orkambi, while the annual proportion of patients with a PEx 
and the annualized PEx rate increased in the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (Study 108 IA3). 
•  LFTs:  The  proportion  of  patients  with  any  LFTs  >1  ×  ULN  was  numerically  lower  in  the  Orkambi 
Safety Cohort compared to the Comparator Cohort. The proportion of patients with ALT and AST >3 × 
ULN  and  total  bilirubin  >2  ×  ULN  was  overall  relatively  uncommon  and  proportions  were  generally 
numerically lower in the Orkambi Safety Cohort or comparable between the 2 cohorts (Study 108 IA3). 
• Organ Transplant: Overall, the risk of transplantation was significantly lower in the Orkambi versus 
the Comparator Safety Cohort (relative risk [RR] = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.57) (Study 108 IA3). 
The  4th  interim  analysis  report  is  expected  in  December  2020  and  will  provide  additional  insights  to 
the long-term effects of Orkambi, including subgroups of adult and pediatric patients. 
Assessor’s comment 
As  requested,  the  MAH  has  provided  Study  120  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  separately  in  the 
subgroups  <18  years  of  age  and  ≥18  years  of  age.  The  paediatric  subgroup  results  for  Study  120 
should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (n = 48). 
ppFEV1: Study 120 results showed that, in the overall population, ppFEV1 remained generally stable 
over  the  3-year  study  duration  (mean  ppFEV1  66.34,  65.24,  and  66.36,  respectively  in  2016,  2017, 
2018).  The  sensitivity  analysis  that  included  only  subjects  with  continuous  Orkambi  exposure  from 
2016 to 2018, showed in the overall population a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.15 percentage point 
EMA/610236/2021  
Page 48/49 
 
  
 
 
in  the  first  year  and  of  -0.79  in  the  second  year.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  previously 
published rate of lung function decline analysis in Orkambi-treated patients 12 years of age and older 
from  Study  105  (PROGRESS  Study)  (Konstan  et  al  2017).  This  analysis  was  performed  using 
propensity scores and matching a subset of Study 105 subjects (n = 455) with US CFF Patient Registry 
control patients (n = 1,588) who were not treated with a CFTR modulator. The estimated annualized 
rate  of  lung  function  decline  was  -1.33  percentage  points  in  the  Orkambi-treated  group,  which  was 
significantly less than the rate in matched controls (-2.29 percentage points, probability [P]< 0.001). 
In  the  subgroup  of  paediatric  patients  12-<18  years  in  Study  105,  treated  with  Orkambi  L400q12h/I 
both in the parent study and in Study 105, a mean absolute change from baseline of 2.8 percentage 
points was observed at 48 weeks, of 1.2 percentage points at 72 weeks, and of -0.4 percentage points 
observed at week 96.  
In  Study  120,  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric  patients  12-<18  years  (n=48),  a  mean  decrease  of  -2.1 
percentage point in the first year and of -0.66 in the second year was observed in mean ppFEV1 (mean 
ppFEV1  76.40,  74.30,  73.64  percentage  points,  respectively  in  2016,  2017,  2018).  The  sensitivity 
analysis  that  included  only  subjects  with  continuous  Orkambi  exposure  from  2016  to  2018  (N=43), 
showed in the subgroup of patients <18 years a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.96 percentage point in 
the first year and of -1.47 percentage points in the second year. The observed decrease seems slightly 
lower  than  the  annualized  rate  of  lung  function  decline  reported  in  a  published  analysis  of  US  Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) registry data in patients homozygous for F508del, aged 13 through 17 years, 
not  treated  with  a  CFTR  modulator  (-2.66  percentage  points  per  year;  Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros. 
2018;17(4):503-10).  
Additional support for a lower rate of lung function decline with Orkambi treatment compared with an 
untreated  cohort  was  observed  in  the  3rd  interim  analysis  of  the  ongoing  comparator-controlled 
Orkambi post-authorization safety study (PASS; Study 108 Interim Analysis Report 3 [IA3]). A smaller 
decline  in  lung  function  over  4  years  was  observed  in  the  Orkambi  Disease  Progression  Cohort  (n  = 
2,287) compared to the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (n = 3,527) (Study 108 IA3/Figure 5). 
in the subgroup of patients 12 to <18 years of age at the time of Orkambi initiation who remained on 
treatment  through  2018  (n  =  716),  lung  function  change  over  4  years  (from  pre-treatment  baseline 
year  2014  to  2018)  was  -3.84  percentage  points  (approximately  -1.0  percentage  point  per  year) 
versus  -7.62  percentage  points  (approximately  -1.9  percentage  points  per  year)  in  the  untreated 
comparator patients (n = 803). 
Thus, similarly to what observed in Study 105, although a trend towards a numerical decaying of effect 
on lung function (ppFEV1) with longer treatment duration was observed in Orkambi treated subjects in 
Study  120,  the  indirect  comparison  with  published  cohorts  of  US  registry  patients  homozygous  for 
F508del mutation untreated with CFTR modulator therapy (Konstan et al, 2017; Wegener et al, 2018), 
seem to indicate a slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in Orkambi treated patients.  
BMI: In Study 120, mean BMI was stable in the overall Orkambi cohort as well as in the subgroups ≥ 
or < 18 years.  In the subgroup <18 years, there was numerically a slight decrease of BMI for age Z 
scores  during  Study  120  (2016:  -0.02;  2017:  -0.08;  2018:  -0.12),  although  with  overlapping 
confidence intervals, and with values close to zero. For the paediatric subgroup in Study 105, BMI-for-
age z-scores were negative but generally improved throughout Study 105. 
PEx: In the paediatric subgroup (12-<18 years) of patients enrolled in Study 120 (n=48), there was a 
numerical  increase  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  PEx  per  year,  over  the  three  year 
study  duration  (2016:  20/48,  41.7%;  2017:  23/48:  47.9%;  2018:  25/43:  58.1%),  although  event 
rates showed overlapping CI [2016: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.38), 2017: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.29) and 
2018: 1.14 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.57)].

In the adult subgroup (≥18 years) of subjects enrolled in Study 120, the proportion of subjects with at 
least  one  PEx  per  year  was  stable  over  the  3-year  study  duration  (2016:  102/208,  49%;  2017: 
93/191:  48.7%;  2018:  75/159:  47.2%;  annualized  event  rate  of  PEx:  0.93,  0.84  and  0.81, 
respectively in 2016, 2017 and 2018).   
In Study 105, for the paediatric subgroup treated with Orkambi L400q12h/I both in the parent study 
and  in  Study  105,  the  annualized  event  rate  was  0.56.  For  subjects  ≥18  years  treated  with  Orkambi 
L400q12h/I both in the parent study and in Study 105, the annualized event rate was 0.79. In Study 
120,  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric  subjects  (12-<18  years),  the  PEx  rate  seems  higher  compared  to 
Study  105.  However  due  to  the  different  definitions  used  in  the  two  studies,  no  conclusion  may  be 
drawn. 
In the 3rd interim  analysis  of  the  ongoing  PASS  Study  (Study  108) the  annual  proportion  of  patients 
with  pulmonary  exacerbations  remained  similar  from  2014  to  2018  (36.6%  in  2014  and  36.7%  in 
2018).  By contrast the proportion of patients in the Comparator group increased by 8.5%.  The MAH 
has been requested to stratify this data by age in the next interim report of the ongoing PASS study. 
Safety data coming from Study 120 seem consistent with the safety profile described in study 105. 
Given  that  patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  subgroup  (roughly  25%)  of  the 
patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to 
participate),  the  comparison  between  Study  120  and  Study  105  results  is  subject  to  limitations.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  due  to  the  differences  in  data  collection  and  endpoint  definitions,  it  may  not  be 
appropriate to combine the clinical data from Study 105 and the registry-based data from Study 120 or 
directly compare the reported values for each endpoint. For the reasons above, even though the MAH 
has  not  provided  the  results  of  the  two  years  of  treatment  in  Study  105  for  the  subset  of  patients 
enrolled in Study 120, the issue is not further pursued. 
The 4th interim analysis report of the ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide 
additional  data  on  the  long-term  effects  of  Orkambi,  including  subgroups  of  adult  and  paediatric 
patients. 
Overall, the MAH has addressed all questions raised during the procedure satisfactorily. There are no 
further points. The benefit-risk assessment is considered favourable.

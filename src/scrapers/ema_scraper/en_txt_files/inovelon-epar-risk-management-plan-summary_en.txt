Summary of risk management plan for Inovelon 
(rufinamide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Inovelon®.  The RMP details important 
risks of Inovelon®, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will be obtained 
about Inovelon®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Inovelon®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Inovelon® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Inovelon® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Inovelon®'s 
RMP. 
I  The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Inovelon® is authorised for the indication of as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures 
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients four years of age and older.  It contains 
rufinamide as the active substance and it is given orally as a suspension or as film-coated 
tablet(s). 
Further information about the evaluation of Inovelon®’s benefits can be found in Inovelon®’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:  Inovelon EPAR summary 
II Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to 
Minimise or Further Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Inovelon®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Inovelon®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Inovelon® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Inovelon® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Inovelon®.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risks 
Rash and Hypersensitivity including DRESS and SJS (Rash and allergies or over 
reactions of the immune system including drug reaction with eosinophilia [increased 
eosinophils in the body] and systemic symptoms [DRESS] and Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome [SJS]) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Evidence from placebo-controlled (comparing Inovelon® with 
placebo) and open-label extension (treatment is known to both 
participants and the investigators) studies. 
Risk groups and risk factors 
There is currently no evidence to suggest a subpopulation or risk 
factor, that some individuals are more susceptible than others.

Important Potential Risks 
Status Epilepticus (A single epileptic seizure lasting a long time or 2 or more seizures 
that lasts a longer time without recovery between 2 seizures) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk groups and risk factors 
Current evidence from completed clinical studies. 
In patients with known epilepsy, status epilepticus is frequently 
triggered from a discontinuation or change in AED therapy or the 
3 
 
presence of a concurrent febrile illness.  During the development 
of rufinamide a standardised definition of status epilepticus was 
not provided to the investigators and the events were reported 
according to local definitions.  There is currently no evidence to 
suggest a sub-population, or risk factor, that some individuals 
are more susceptible than others.

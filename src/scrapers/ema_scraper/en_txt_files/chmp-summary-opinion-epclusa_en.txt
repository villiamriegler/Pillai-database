Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Epclusa 
sofosbuvir / velpatasvir 
On 26 May 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Epclusa, intended for the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults. The applicant for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. 
Epclusa is a fixed dose combination of two direct-acting antivirals, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. It will be 
available as film-coated tablets (containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg velpatasvir). The active 
metabolite of sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase, while 
velpatasvir targets the NS5A protein of the virus. 
The benefit with Epclusa when used with or without ribavirin is its very high efficacy against all HCV 
genotypes including in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The most common side effects are fatigue, 
headache and nausea. 
The full indication is: "Epclusa is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 
adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1)." It is proposed that Epclusa be prescribed by physicians experienced 
in the management of patients with HCV infection.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

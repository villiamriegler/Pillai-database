CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
IRESSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK (see section 
4.4).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with IRESSA should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer therapies.
Posology
The recommended posology of IRESSA is one 250 mg tablet once a day. If a dose is missed, it should 
be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the patient should 
not take the missed dose. Patients should not take a double dose (two doses at the same time) to make 
up for a forgotten dose.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of IRESSA in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been 
established. There is no relevant use of gefitinib in the paediatric population in the indication of 
NSCLC.
Hepatic impairment
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) due to cirrhosis have 
increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib. These patients should be closely monitored for adverse 
events. Plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with elevated aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin due to liver metastases (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function at creatinine clearance
> 20 ml/min. Only limited data are available in patients with creatinine clearance  20 ml/min and 
caution is advised in these patients (see section 5.2).
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age (see section 5.2).
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers
No specific dose adjustment is recommended in patients with known CYP2D6 poor metaboliser 
genotype, but these patients should be closely monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2).
Dose adjustment due to toxicity
Patients with poorly tolerated diarrhoea or skin adverse reactions may be successfully managed by 
providing a brief (up to 14 days) therapy interruption followed by reinstatement of the 250 mg dose 
(see section 4.8). For patients unable to tolerate treatment after a therapy interruption, gefitinib should 
be discontinued and an alternative treatment should be considered.
Method of administration
The tablet may be taken orally with or without food, at about the same time each day. The tablet can be 
swallowed whole with some water or if dosing of whole tablets is not possible, tablets may be 
administered as a dispersion in water (non-carbonated). No other liquids should be used. Without 
crushing it, the tablet should be dropped in half a glass of drinking water. The glass should be swirled 
occasionally, until the tablet is dispersed (this may take up to 20 minutes). The dispersion should be 
drunk immediately after dispersion is complete (i.e. within 60 minutes). The glass should be rinsed 
with half a glass of water, which should also be drunk. The dispersion can also be administered 
through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When considering the use of IRESSA as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, it is 
important that EGFR mutation assessment of the tumour tissue is attempted for all patients. If a tumour 
sample is not evaluable, then circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) obtained from a blood (plasma) 
sample may be used.
Only robust, reliable and sensitive test(s) with demonstrated utility for the determination of EGFR 
mutation status of tumours or ctDNA should be used to avoid false negative or false positive 
determinations (see section 5.1).
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) which may be acute in onset, has been observed in 1.3% of patients 
receiving gefitinib, and some cases have been fatal (see section 4.8). If patients experience worsening 
of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, IRESSA should be interrupted and the 
patient should be promptly investigated. If ILD is confirmed, IRESSA should be discontinued and the 
patient treated appropriately.
In a Japanese pharmacoepidemiological case control study in 3,159 patients with NSCLC receiving 
gefitinib or chemotherapy who were followed up for 12 weeks, the following risk factors for 
developing ILD (irrespective of whether the patient received IRESSA or chemotherapy) were 
identified: smoking, poor performance status (PS ≥ 2), CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung 
(≤ 50%), recent diagnosis of NSCLC (< 6 months), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 55 years old) and
concurrent cardiac disease. An increased risk of ILD on gefitinib relative to chemotherapy was seen 
predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment (adjusted OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.7); thereafter 
the relative risk was lower (adjusted OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8). Risk of mortality among patients who 
developed ILD on IRESSA or chemotherapy was higher in patients with the following risk factors: 
smoking, CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung (≤ 50%), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 65 years 
old), and extensive areas adherent to pleura (≥ 50%).
Hepatotoxicity and liver impairment
Liver function test abnormalities (including increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, bilirubin) have been observed, uncommonly presenting as hepatitis (see section 4.8). 
There have been isolated reports of hepatic failure which in some cases led to fatal outcomes. 
Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. Gefitinib should be used cautiously in the 
presence of mild to moderate changes in liver function. Discontinuation should be considered if 
changes are severe.
Impaired liver function due to cirrhosis has been shown to lead to increased plasma concentrations of 
gefitinib (see section 5.2).
Interactions with other medicinal products
CYP3A4 inducers may increase metabolism of gefitinib and decrease gefitinib plasma concentrations. 
Therefore, concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
rifampicin, barbiturates or herbal preparations containing St John’s wort/Hypericum perforatum) may 
reduce efficacy of the treatment and should be avoided (see section 4.5).
In individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype, treatment with a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor might lead to increased plasma levels of gefitinib. At initiation of treatment with a CYP3A4 
inhibitor, patients should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions (see section 4.5).
International normalised ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some 
patients taking warfarin together with gefitinib (see section 4.5). Patients taking warfarin and gefitinib 
concomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time (PT) or INR.
Medicinal products that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH, such as proton-pump 
inhibitors and h2-antagonists may reduce bioavailability and plasma concentrations of gefitinib and, 
therefore, may reduce efficacy. Antacids if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib
may have a similar effect (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
Data from phase II clinical trials, where gefitinib and vinorelbine have been used concomitantly, 
indicate that gefitinib may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of vinorelbine.
Lactose
IRESSA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium
IRESSA contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per tablet, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free.’
Further precautions for use
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience severe or persistent 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia as these may indirectly lead to dehydration. These symptoms 
should be managed as clinically indicated (see section 4.8).
Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye 
inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred
promptly to an ophthalmology specialist.
If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with gefitinib should be interrupted, and if 
symptoms do not resolve, or if symptoms recur on reintroduction of gefitinib, permanent 
discontinuation should be considered.
In a phase I/II trial studying the use of gefitinib and radiation in paediatric patients, with newly 
diagnosed brain stem glioma or incompletely resected supratentorial malignant glioma, 4 cases 
(1 fatal) of Central Nervous System (CNS) haemorrhages were reported from 45 patients enrolled. A 
further case of CNS haemorrhage has been reported in a child with an ependymoma from a trial with 
gefitinib alone. An increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage in adult patients with NSCLC receiving 
gefitinib has not been established.
Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients taking gefitinib. In most cases this is 
associated with other known risk factors, including concomitant medications such as steroids or 
NSAIDS, underlying history of GI ulceration, age, smoking or bowel metastases at sites of perforation.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The metabolism of gefitinib is via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 (predominantly) and via 
CYP2D6.
Active substances that may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib is a substrate of p-glycoprotein (Pgp). Available data do not 
suggest any clinical consequences to this in vitro finding.
Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of gefitinib. Concomitant administration 
with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, protease 
inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin) may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations. The increase 
may be clinically relevant since adverse reactions are related to dose and exposure. The increase might 
be higher in individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype. Pre-treatment with 
itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an 80% increase in the mean AUC of gefitinib in 
healthy volunteers. In situations of concomitant treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 the 
patient should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions.
There are no data on concomitant treatment with an inhibitor of CYP2D6 but potent inhibitors of this 
enzyme might cause increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers 
by about 2-fold (see section 5.2). If concomitant treatment with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor is initiated, 
the patient should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.
Active substances that may reduce gefitinib plasma concentrations
Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may increase metabolism and decrease gefitinib 
plasma concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. Concomitant medicinal products 
that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates or St John’s wort/
Hypericum perforatum) should be avoided. Pre-treatment with rifampicin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) 
in healthy volunteers reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 83% (see section 4.4).
Substances that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH may reduce gefitinib plasma 
concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. High doses of short-acting antacids may 
have a similar effect if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib. Concomitant 
administration of gefitinib with ranitidine at a dose that caused sustained elevations in gastric pH ≥ 5 
resulted in a reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 47% in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4 and 5.2).
Active substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by gefitinib
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. In a clinical trial in 
patients, gefitinib was co-administered with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate). This resulted in a 35% 
increase in exposure to metoprolol. Such an increase might potentially be relevant for CYP2D6 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index. When the use of CYP2D6 substrates are considered in 
combination with gefitinib, a dose modification of the CYP2D6 substrate should be considered 
especially for products with a narrow therapeutic window.
Gefitinib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is 
unknown.
Other potential interactions
INR elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients concomitantly taking 
warfarin (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential must be advised not to get pregnant during therapy.
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of gefitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IRESSA should not 
be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether gefitinib is secreted in human milk. Gefitinib and metabolites of gefitinib 
accumulated in milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Gefitinib is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding and therefore breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving gefitinib therapy (see 
section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
During treatment with gefitinib, asthenia has been reported. Therefore, patients who experience this 
symptom should be cautious when driving or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In the pooled dataset from the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical trials 
(2462 IRESSA-treated patients), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 
occurring in more than 20% of the patients, are diarrhoea and skin reactions (including rash, acne, dry 
skin and pruritus). ADRs usually occur within the first month of therapy and are generally reversible. 
Approximately 8% of patients had a severe ADR (common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4). 
Approximately 3% of patients stopped therapy due to an ADR.
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has occurred in 1.3% of patients, often severe (CTC grade 3-4). Cases 
with fatal outcomes have been reported.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety profile presented in Table 1 is based on the gefitinib clinical development programme and 
postmarketed experience. Adverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 1 
where possible based on the incidence of comparable adverse event reports in a pooled dataset from 
the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical trials (2462 IRESSA-treated patients).
Frequencies of occurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare 
(< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

gefitinib.
**This includes isolated reports of hepatic failure which in some cases led to fatal outcomes.
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
In the INTEREST trial, the incidence of ILD type events was 1.4% (10) patients in the gefitinib group
versus 1.1% (8) patients in the docetaxel group. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a 
patient receiving gefitinib.
In the ISEL trial, the incidence of ILD-type events in the overall population was approximately 1% in 
both treatment arms. The majority of ILD-type events reported was from patients of Asian ethnicity 
and the ILD incidence among patients of Asian ethnicity receiving gefitinib therapy and placebo was 
approximately 3% and 4% respectively. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient 
receiving placebo.
In a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan (3350 patients) the reported rate of ILD-type events in 
patients receiving gefitinib was 5.8%. The proportion of ILD-type events with a fatal outcome was 
38.6%.
In a phase III open-label clinical trial (IPASS) in 1217 patients comparing IRESSA to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in selected patients with advanced 
NSCLC in Asia, the incidence of ILD-type events was 2.6% on the IRESSA treatment arm versus 
1.4% on the carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment arm.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose of gefitinib. However, in phase I clinical trials, 
a limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to 1000 mg. An increase of frequency 
and severity of some adverse reactions was observed, mainly diarrhoea and skin rash. Adverse 
reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically; in particular severe diarrhoea 
should be managed as clinically indicated. In one study a limited number of patients were treated 
weekly with doses from 1500 mg to 3500 mg. In this study IRESSA exposure did not increase with 
increasing dose, adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and were consistent with the 
known safety profile of IRESSA.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01EB01
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR [HER1; ErbB1]) have been identified as 
key drivers in the process of cell growth and proliferation for normal and cancer cells. EGFR 
activating mutation within a cancer cell is an important factor in promotion of tumour cell growth, 
blocking of apoptosis, increasing the production of angiogenic factors and facilitating the processes of 
metastasis.
Gefitinib is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase 
and is an effective treatment for patients with tumours with activating mutations of the EGFR tyrosine 
kinase domain regardless of line of therapy. No clinically relevant activity has been shown in patients 
with known EGFR mutation-negative tumours.
The common EGFR activating mutations (Exon 19 deletions; L858R) have robust response data 
supporting sensitivity to gefitinib; for example a progression free survival HR (95% CI) of 0.489 
(0.336, 0.710) for gefitinib vs. doublet chemotherapy [WJTOG3405]. Gefitinib response data is more 
sparse in patients whose tumours contain the less common mutations; the available data indicates that 
G719X, L861Q and S7681 are sensitising mutations; and T790M alone or exon 20 insertions alone are 
resistance mechanisms.
Resistance
Most NSCLC tumours with sensitising EGFR kinase mutations eventually develop resistance to 
IRESSA treatment, with a median time to disease progression of 1 year. In about 60% of cases, 
resistance is associated with a secondary T790M mutation for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may 
be considered as a next line treatment option. Other potential mechanisms of resistance that have been 
reported following treatment with EGFR signal blocking agents include: bypass signalling such as
HER2 and MET gene amplification and PIK3CA mutations. Phenotypic switch to small cell lung 
cancer has also been reported in 5-10% of cases.
Circulating Tumour DNA (ctDNA)
In the IFUM trial, mutation status was assessed in tumour and ctDNA samples derived from plasma, 
using the Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Both ctDNA and tumour samples were evaluable 
for 652 patients out of 1060 screened. The objective response rate (ORR) in those patients who were 
tumour and ctDNA mutation positive was 77% (95% CI: 66% to 86%) and in those who were tumour 
only mutation positive 60% (95% CI: 44% to 74%).

These data are consistent with the pre-planned exploratory Japanese subgroup analysis in IPASS (Goto

using the EGFR Mutation Test Kit (DxS) (N= 86). In that study, sensitivity was 43.1%, specificity was 
100%.
Clinical efficacy and safety
First line treatment
The randomised phase III first line IPASS study was conducted in patients in Asia1 with advanced 
(stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology who were ex-light smokers (ceased smoking 
> 15 years ago and smoked < 10 pack years) or never smokers (see Table 3).

of the EGFR tyrosine kinase.
Pretreated patients
The randomised phase III INTEREST study was conducted in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. In the overall 
population, no statistically significant difference between gefitinib and docetaxel (75 mg/m2) was 
observed for overall survival, progression free survival and objective response rates (see Table 5).

EGFR mutation status and clinical characteristics
Clinical characteristics of never smoker, adenocarcinoma histology, and female gender have been 
shown to be independent predictors of positive EGFR mutation status in a multivariate analysis of 
786 Caucasian patients from gefitinib studies* (see Table 7). Asian patients also have a higher 
incidence of EGFR mutation-positive tumours.

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following oral administration of gefitinib, absorption is moderately slow and peak plasma 
concentrations of gefitinib typically occur at 3 to 7 hours after administration. Mean absolute 
bioavailability is 59% in cancer patients. Exposure to gefitinib is not significantly altered by food. In a 
trial in healthy volunteers where gastric pH was maintained above pH 5, gefitinib exposure was 
reduced by 47%, likely due to impaired solubility of gefitinib in the stomach (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Distribution
Gefitinib has a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 1400 l indicating extensive distribution into 
tissue. Plasma protein binding is approximately 90%. Gefitinib binds to serum albumin and alpha 
1-acid glycoprotein.
In vitro data indicate that gefitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport protein P-gp.
Biotransformation
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the major P450 isozyme involved in the oxidative 
metabolism of gefitinib.
16
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Gefitinib shows no 
enzyme induction effects in animal studies and no significant inhibition (in vitro) of any other 
cytochrome P450 enzyme.
Gefitinib is extensively metabolised in humans. Five metabolites have been fully identified in excreta 
and 8 metabolites in plasma. The major metabolite identified was O-desmethyl gefitinib, which is 
14-fold less potent than gefitinib at inhibiting EGFR stimulated cell growth and has no inhibitory 
effect on tumour cell growth in mice. It is therefore considered unlikely that it contributes to the 
clinical activity of gefitinib.
The formation of O-desmethyl gefitinib has been shown, in vitro, to be via CYP2D6. The role of 
CYP2D6 in the metabolic clearance of gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical trial in healthy 
volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 status. In poor metabolisers no measurable levels of O-desmethyl 
gefitinib were produced. The levels of exposure to gefitinib achieved in both the extensive and the 
poor metaboliser groups were wide and overlapping but the mean exposure to gefitinib was 2-fold 
higher in the poor metaboliser group. The higher average exposures that could be achieved by 
individuals with no active CYP2D6 may be clinically relevant since adverse effects are related to dose 
and exposure.
Elimination
Gefitinib is excreted mainly as metabolites via the faeces, with renal elimination of gefitinib and 
metabolites accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose.
Gefitinib total plasma clearance is approximately 500 ml/min and the mean terminal half-life is 
41 hours in cancer patients. Administration of gefitinib once daily results in 2- to 8-fold accumulation, 
with steady state exposures achieved after 7 to 10 doses. At steady state, circulating plasma 
concentrations are typically maintained within a 2- to 3-fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval.
Special populations
From analyses of population pharmacokinetic data in cancer patients, no relationships were identified 
between predicted steady-state trough concentration and patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity or 
creatinine clearance (above 20 ml/min).
Hepatic impairment
In a phase I open-label study of single dose gefitinib 250 mg in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-Pugh classification), there was an increase in 
exposure in all groups compared with healthy controls. An average 3.1-fold increase in exposure to 
gefitinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment was observed. None of the patients 
had cancer, all had cirrhosis and some had hepatitis. This increase in exposure may be of clinical 
relevance since adverse experiences are related to dose and exposure to gefitinib.
Gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical trial conducted in 41 patients with solid tumours and normal 
hepatic function, or moderate or severe hepatic impairment (classified according to baseline Common 
Toxicity Criteria grades for AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) due to liver metastases. It was
shown that following daily administration of 250 mg gefitinib, time to steady-state, total plasma 
clearance (CmaxSS) and steady-state exposure (AUC24SS) were similar for the groups with normal and 
17
moderately impaired hepatic function. Data from 4 patients with severe hepatic impairment due to liver 
metastases suggested that steady-state exposures in these patients are also similar to those in patients 
with normal hepatic function.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to the 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows:



Corneal epithelia atrophy and corneal translucencies
Renal papillary necrosis
Hepatocellular necrosis and eosinophilic sinusoidal macrophage infiltration
Data from non-clinical (in vitro) studies indicate that gefitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac 
action potential repolarisation process (e.g. QT interval). Clinical experience has not shown a causal 
association between QT prolongation and gefitinib.
A reduction in female fertility was observed in the rat at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.
Published studies have shown that genetically modified mice, lacking expression of EGFR, exhibit 
developmental defects, related to epithelial immaturity in a variety of organs including the skin, 
gastrointestinal tract and lung. When gefitinib was administered to rats during organogenesis, there 
were no effects on embryofoetal development at the highest dose (30 mg/kg/day). However, in the 
rabbit, there were reduced foetal weights at 20 mg/kg/day and above. There were no 
compound-induced malformations in either species. When administered to the rat throughout gestation 
and parturition, there was a reduction in pup survival at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.
Following oral administration of C-14 labelled gefitinib to lactating rats 14 days post-partum, 
concentrations of radioactivity in milk were 11-19 fold higher than in blood.
Gefitinib showed no genotoxic potential.
A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats resulted in a small but statistically significant increased 
incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in both male and female rats and mesenteric lymph node 
haemangiosarcomas in female rats at the highest dose (10 mg/kg/day) only. The hepatocellular 
adenomas were also seen in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, which demonstrated a small 
increased incidence of this finding in male mice at the mid dose, and in both male and female mice at 
the highest dose. The effects reached statistical significance for the female mice, but not for the males.
At no-effect levels in both mice and rats there was no margin in clinical exposure. The clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown.
The results of an in vitro phototoxicity study demonstrated that gefitinib may have phototoxicity 
potential.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What IRESSA is and what it is used for
IRESSA contains the active substance gefitinib which blocks a protein called ‘epidermal growth factor 
receptor’ (EGFR). This protein is involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.
IRESSA is used to treat adults with non-small cell lung cancer. This cancer is a disease in which 
malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
2.
What you need to know before you take IRESSA
Do not take IRESSA

if you are allergic to gefitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6, ‘What IRESSA contains’).

if you are breast-feeding.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking IRESSA

if you have ever had any other lung problems. Some lung problems may get worse during 
treatment with IRESSA.

if you have ever had problems with your liver.
31
Children and adolescents
IRESSA is not indicated in children and adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and IRESSA


Phenytoin or carbamazepine (for epilepsy).
Rifampicin (for tuberculosis).
Itraconazole (for fungal infections).
Barbiturates (a type of medicine used for sleeping problems).
Herbal remedies containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, used for depression and 
anxiety).

Proton-pump inhibitors, H2-antagonists and antacids (for ulcers, indigestion, heartburn and to 
reduce acids in the stomach).
These medicines may affect the way IRESSA works.

Warfarin (a so-called oral anticoagulant, to prevent blood clots). If you are taking a medicine 
containing this active substance, your doctor may need to do blood tests more often.
If any of the above applies to you, or if you are not sure, check with your doctor or pharmacist before 
taking IRESSA.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
Talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are pregnant, may become pregnant or are 
breast-feeding.
It is recommended that you avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with IRESSA because IRESSA
could harm your baby.

Possible side effects
Like all medicines this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects - you may need urgent 
medical treatment:





Allergic reaction (common), particularly if symptoms include swollen face, lips, tongue or 
throat, difficulty to swallow, hives, nettle rash and difficulty breathing.
Serious breathlessness, or sudden worsening breathlessness, possibly with a cough or fever. 
This may mean that you have an inflammation of the lungs called ‘interstitial lung disease’. This 
may affect about 1 in 100 patients taking IRESSA and can be life-threatening.
Severe skin reactions (rare) affecting large areas of your body. The signs may include redness, 
pain, ulcers, blisters, and shedding of the skin. The lips, nose, eyes and genitals may also be 
affected.
Dehydration (common) caused by long term or severe diarrhoea, vomiting (being sick), nausea 
(feeling sick) or loss of appetite.
Eye problems (uncommon), such as pain, redness, watery eyes, light sensitivity, changes in 
vision or ingrowing eyelashes. This may mean that you have an ulcer on the surface of the eye 
(cornea).

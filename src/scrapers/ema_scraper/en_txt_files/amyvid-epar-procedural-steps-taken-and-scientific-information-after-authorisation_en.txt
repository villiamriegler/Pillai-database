Based on the review of data on quality, safety, and

efficacy, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance 
PL 
of Amyvid in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the data from studies QP01 and QP02, the MAH 
to introduce quantitative read as an adjunct to visual 
II and Labelling 
proposes changes to the SmPC, reflecting the following key 
Avymid 
EMA/189127/2021 
Page 6/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
read of florbetapir (18F) PET scans. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.0. 
The updated RMP version 2.2 has been submitted 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
principles: 
• 
Addition of results and conclusions from studies 
QP01 and QP02 indicating that quantitation when used as 
an adjunct to the qualitative interpretation may improve 
readers’ accuracy. 
• 
The use of quantitation is proposed to be optional 
because not all PET users may have access to software with 
quantitation capabilities suitable for use with the proposed 
method, and since the approved visual read method has 
been demonstrated to have sufficient accuracy.   
• 
The MAH proposes not to limit the use of 
quantitative software packages to those software packages 
used in the QP01 and QP02 trials. Indeed, the software 
packages used in these trials may not be available in all EU 
countries and new innovations in software packages may 
become available.  Therefore, the proposed SmPC wording 
allows for broader quantitative software access and 
preserves the possibility of future innovations in the 
quantitative software. The quantitative reader training 
program will specify minimum recommended elements for 
quantitative software to be used as an adjunct quantitation 
of florbetapir (18F) PET images.

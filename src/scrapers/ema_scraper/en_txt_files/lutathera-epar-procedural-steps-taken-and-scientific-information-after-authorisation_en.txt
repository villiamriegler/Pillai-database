are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Lutathera existing dossier, current medical practice 
and new literature). Annex IIIA and the package

additional corrections and changes are made 
throughout the product information (PI) to comply 
with the latest QRD template and to improve the

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
• 
Most of the changes were made to the posology 
and method of administration and instructions for 
preparation of radiopharmaceuticals: 
clarification that there is a 1 week flexibility in the interval 
between each administration; changes to the 
recommendation regarding hydration and urination during 
treatment to reduce toxicity risk; clarification that 
permanent discontinuation is needed in case of adverse 
reactions requiring dosing interval beyond 16 weeks; new 
text to allow physicians to perform infusion of the amino 
acid solution in the same arm as Lutathera, while infusion 
in different arms remain the preferred method; a footnote 
in the dose modification table clarifying that lymphopenia is 
not a dose modifying toxicity; introduction and description 
of the syringe pump method when delivering a reduced 
dose of Lutathera 
•

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
LUTATHERA in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

This variation implements updated long term efficacy and 
the pivotal Phase III study, NETTER-1. Additionally, 
Labelling and 
safety clinical information following the completion of study 
updates are proposed in the PI to correct some 
information based on currently approved data. The 
MAH also took the opportunity to add some minor 
editorial changes in the PI. The PL is updated 
accordingly. The MAH took also the opportunity to 
update the details of all local representatives in the 
PL. The RMP v. 2.0 has been submitted.

clearance < 40 mL/min at baseline (using Cockcroft Gault) 
is not recommended. No dose adjustment is recommended 
for renally impaired patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 40 
mL/min. However, as this medicinal product is known to be 
substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function should 
be more frequently monitored during the treatment as 
these patients may be at a greater risk of toxicity. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
has not been studied (total bilirubin > 3 times upper limit 
of normal and any ASAT), therefore those patients should 
only be treated with Lutathera after careful benefit-risk 
assessment. 
The recommended infusion method for administration of 
Lutathera is the gravity method. 
Addition of specific warnings and precautions in SmPC 
section 4.4 regarding the co-administered renal protective 
amino acid solution.

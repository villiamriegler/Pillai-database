SmPC 
The primary objective of ECZTRA 4 was to evaluate the 
Update of section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order 
to add drug-drug interaction information with 
cytochrome P450 and CYP substrates based on final 
results from study ECZTRA 4 (LP0162-1342). This is 
an open-label drug–drug interaction trial to 
investigate the effects of tralokinumab on the 
pharmacokinetics of selected CYP substrates in adult 
subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity make 
editorial changes to sections 4.8, 6.5 and 9 of SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
effects of tralokinumab on the pharmacokinetics of selected 
CYP substrates (caffeine [CYP1A2], warfarin [CYP2C9], 
metoprolol [CYP2D6], omeprazole [CYP2C19] and 
midazolam [CYP3A], in adult subjects with moderate-to-
severe atopic dermatitis after repeated administration.  
No effects were observed for caffeine and warfarin. Small 
numerical changes, which were not clinically significant, 
were observed for Cmax of omeprazole, AUC of metoprolol 
and AUC and Cmax of midazolam (the largest difference 
being for midazolam Cmax with a decrease of 22%). 
Therefore, clinically relevant impact of tralokinumab on the 
pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicines metabolised by 
the CYP enzymes is not expected and no dose adjustment

on final study LP0162-1334 (ECZTRA 6): a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study in adolescent patients 12 to 17 
years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
tralokinumab monotherapy in this population 
group.As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance.

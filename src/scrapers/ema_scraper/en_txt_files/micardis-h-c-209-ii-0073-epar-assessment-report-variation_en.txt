1.1  Introduction 
Telmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist (AIIA), 
which  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  essential  hypertension.  It  can  be  used  alone  or  in 
combination  with  other  antihypertensive  agents  e.g. 
such  as 
hydrochlorothiazide.    The  most  commonly  used  dose  in  clinical  practice  is  80  mg  although  a  blood 
pressure lowering effect can be seen at 40 mg and in some patients even 20 mg. 
thiazides-type  diuretics 
Telmisartan  was  approved for the treatment of hypertension in the European Union (EU) and in the 
United  States  of  America  in  1998.  Currently  telmisartan  is  approved  in  more  than  70  countries  (EU 
counted as 1 country) and marketed in 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg dose strengths; the most commonly 
used trade names are Micardis, Pritor and Kinzalmono. 
Since the first 5-year renewal in 2003 about fifty studies have been carried out: the focus has been on 
patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, except for three trials that enrolled patients at 
high  risk  of  developing  a  cardiovascular  event,  irrespective  of  their  blood  pressure  status.  Overall, 
results from these studies have confirmed the efficacy profile of telmisartan in long term treatment of 
essential hypertension. 
The second Marketing Authorisation renewal procedure was finalised with a positive CHMP opinion 
in September 2008 granting unlimited validity on the basis of a favourable re-evaluation of the benefit 
risk balance. 
In  this  application,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  originally  proposed  to  extend  the 
indication as follows: 
“Prevention  of  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  55  years  or  older  at  high  risk  of 
cardiovascular disease”. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed to amend SPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 as well and to update the 
Package  Leaflet  (PL)  accordingly.  In  addition,  Annex  II  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  latest  RMP 
version as agreed by the CHMP. 
Requests for Supplementary Information were adopted during the March 2009 and July 2009 CHMP 
meetings. The claimed new indication was not considered approvable at that time as major objections 
with regard to the efficacy in the pivotal trial had been identified. 
During its meeting in July 2009, the CHMP agreed to convene a Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory 
Group (CV-SAG) in order to further elaborate on the major objections of the procedure. The CV-SAG 
meeting was held on 30 September 2009. 
An Oral Explanation took place on 16 October 2009.  
1.2  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The new claim for cardiovascular (CV) prevention is beyond CV prevention in patients with essential 
hypertension  that  is  already  covered  by  the  approved  indication.  The  application  is  based  on  three 
controlled  clinical  studies,  the  ONTARGET  study  (n=25620,  pivotal  study),  the  TRANSCEND 
(n=5926) and PRoFESS (n=20332) studies (supportive studies). 
The prevention of cardiovascular disease represents one of the most important aspects of preventive 
medicine today. The terms primary and secondary prevention have been used to encompass patients 
with  or  without  established  clinical  evidence  of  cardiovascular  disease.  A  more  comprehensive 
strategy to prevent CV disease aims at  treating patients based on total CV risk. Treatment decisions 
and  definition  of  high  risk  for  CV  disease  can  be  based  on  CV  risk  scores  (for  background  see 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/311890/2007).  
Cardiovascular  disease  is  a  continuum;  factors  such  as  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  and 
atherosclerosis  lead  to  end-organ  damage  and  may  ultimately  result  in  heart  failure,  stroke,  renal 
disease, or death. Research has shown that the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
(RAAS) plays an important role in all phases of the cardiovascular disease continuum.  
2 
 
 
 
Angiotensin  II  is  the  main  effector  peptide  of  the  RAAS.  Angiotensin-II  induces  vasoconstriction, 
cardiac  muscle  cell  proliferation  and  migration,  inflammatory  responses,  enhanced  coagulation,  and 
collagen  synthesis,  all  of  which  are  important  processes  in  the  development  of  atherosclerosis  and 
acute  coronary  syndromes.  The  effects  of  angiotensin II  can  be  attenuated  by  inhibiting  the 
angiotensin  converting  enzyme  using  an  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  inhibitor  (ACE-I)  or  by 
blocking the angiotensin II subtype 1-receptors using an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).  
Several studies have investigated the influence of different drugs that negatively regulated the activity 
of  the  RAAS  in  the  prevention  of  CV  disease  in  selected  patients  with  increased  CV  risk 
independently of the blood pressure lowering effect. As a key study the HOPE study demonstrated in 
high-risk patients (55 years of age or older) who had evidence of vascular disease or diabetes plus one 
other cardiovascular risk factor that ramipril reduced the incidence of the 3-fold composite endpoint of 
MI, stroke, and death due to cardiovascular causes (CV death) in patients at high risk for such events. 
The  relative  risk  reduction  of  10 mg  daily  of  ramipril  compared  with  placebo  over  4.5  years  of 
treatment was 22% for the 3-fold composite endpoint (MI, stroke, and CV death) (N Engl J Med 2000 
Jan  20;  342(3):145-53).  On  the  other  hand  it  was  less  clear,  whether  an  ARB  (eprosartan)  was 
effective  in  the  secondary  prevention  of  stroke  in  hypertensive  patients  beyond  a  blood  pressure 
lowering effect (MOSES study, Stroke 2005; 36: 1218-1226). 
The  recommended  dose  of  telmisartan  for  the  Prevention  of  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality 
indication is 80 mg once daily. The MAH states that it is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg 
of telmisartan are effective in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
In  accordance  with  the  recommendation  provided  in  the  proposed  SPC,  when  initiating  telmisartan 
therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity, monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, 
and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be necessary. 
Summary of Clinical Development Program supporting the new proposed indication 
The clinical trial program for telmisartan in reduction of risk for major cardiovascular events such as 
MI,  stroke,  CV  death,  and  hospitalisation  for  CHF,  consisted  of  3  large,  global,  prospective, 
randomised,  double-blind  outcome  trials,  namely  the  ONTARGET  (n=25620),  TRANSCEND 
(n=5926),  and  PRoFESS  (n=20332)  studies.  The  planned  study  durations  were  up  to  5.5  years  in 
ONTARGET, up to 6 years in TRANSCEND, and up to 4.5 years in PRoFESS.  
To  demonstrate  efficacy  of  telmisartan  in  the  new  proposed  indication,  the  ONTARGET  trial  is 
considered  pivotal,  while  the  TRANSCEND  and  the  PRoFESS  trials  provide  supportive  evidence. 
Data from the TRANSCEND and PRoFESS studies (i.e. from patients who did not receive an ACE-I 
at any time during these studies) were analysed by the MAH for the purpose of this submission since 
the  use  of  dual  RAAS  blockade  had  been  shown  to  have  a  negative  benefit/risk  ratio  in  the 
ONTARGET study.  
The  populations  included  in  these  3  large  trials  were  in  general  overlapping  and  constitute  a 
representative  cross-section  of  patients  at  the  moderately-high  to  very-high  risk  stages  of  the 
cardiovascular  disease  spectrum.  ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  included  men  and  women  who 
were 55 years of age or older and at high risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular event.  
Being at high risk was defined as having coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, previous 
stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or high-risk diabetes mellitus with evidence of end-organ 
damage.  Patients  who  had  CHF,  uncontrolled  hypertension  (BP  >160/100 mmHg),  significant  renal 
artery disease, or hepatic dysfunction at study entry could not participate.  
ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  trials  used  the  same  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  with  only 
2 exceptions:  patients  entered  into  the  TRANSCEND  study  were  to  be  intolerant  to  ACE-Is  and 
patients with clinically significant proteinuria were excluded as well due to the ethical consideration. 
The blinded study medications were given in addition to medications and other treatments necessary to 
provide medical care according to practice guidelines and national standards. It is acknowledged that, 
since the completion of the HOPE trial, there have been improvements in the care of patients at risk of 
cardiovascular  events;  in  particular  the  use  of  statins  and  other  cardioprotective  agents  such  as  beta 
blockers has increased substantially.  
3 
The  primary  endpoint  examined  in  both  the  ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  trials  was  a  4-fold 
composite  endpoint  of  time  to  MI,  stroke,  CV  death,  or  hospitalisation  for  CHF.  The  ONTARGET 
study investigated the effectiveness of telmisartan (T), ramipril (R), and a combination of both (T/R) 
while the TRANSCEND study evaluated telmisartan and placebo (PBO). A key secondary endpoint in 
ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  was  the  3-fold  endpoint  of  MI,  stroke,  and  CV  death,  the  same 
endpoint as employed in the HOPE study as the primary endpoint.  
Men and women enrolled into the PRoFESS trial were permitted to be slightly younger (50 years of 
age  and  older)  and  were  required  to  have  suffered  a  previous  ischaemic  stroke  within  120  days  of 
enrolment.  
The  PRoFESS  study  had a  2x2  factorial  design;  all  patients  were  randomised  to  antiplatelet  therapy 
with either a fixed-dose combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (ASA+ER-DP) or 
clopidogrel  and  at  the  same  time  to  either  telmisartan  or  placebo.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the 
incidence  of  recurrent  stroke.  The  4-fold  composite  endpoint  of  MI,  stroke,  CV  death,  new  or 
worsening CHF was analysed as a secondary endpoint, while the 3-fold (HOPE) endpoint (MI, stroke, 
CV  death)  was  analysed  post  hoc  to  relate  the  PRoFESS  results  to  those  of  ONTARGET, 
TRANSCEND, and HOPE, where this endpoint was prespecified. All study medications were given 
on top of current standard care.  
For the confirmatory analysis of efficacy, the intent-to treat principle was followed in all 3 trials. In 
ONTARGET and TRANSCEND, the full analysis set  (FAS) was defined including all patients who 
were  randomised  and  for  whom  follow-up  information  was  available.  For  the  primary  analyses  in 
PRoFESS, the randomised set (RAN) was employed consisting of those patients who signed informed 
consent and were randomised. 
1.3 Pivotal Study - ONTARGET TRIAL 
ONTARGET  (ONgoing  Telmisartan  Alone  and  in  Combination  with  Ramipril  Global 
Endpoint Trial 502.373 / U08-1821-01) was a large scale randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 
international  trial  comparing  telmisartan  80 mg,  ramipril  10 mg,  and  their  combination  in  the 
prevention of morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. 
Objective 
The objective of the ONTARGET trial was to determine if (a) the combination of telmisartan 80 mg 
and ramipril 10 mg (T/R) is superior to ramipril 10 mg (R) alone and if (b) telmisartan 80 mg (T) is 
not inferior to ramipril 10 mg alone in reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death, 
myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for congestive heart failure (CHF).  
It was also of primary interest (primary renal endpoint) to compare the treatments (T/R vs. R and T vs. 
R) concerning the composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, progression to end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality in the subgroup of diabetic nephropathy patients (i.e. diabetic 
patients  with  macroalbuminuria  assessed  as  a  urinary  albumin  creatinine  ratio  [UACR]  ≥300  mg/g 
Crea  at  baseline).  Progression  to  ESRD  was  defined  as  initiation  of  dialysis,  estimated  glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or need for renal transplantation. 
An  additional  objective,  using  an  exploratory  analysis,  was  to  investigate  whether  T/R  is  more 
effective than T concerning these endpoints. 
Primary outcome 
The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
or hospitalisation for heart failure.   
Secondary outcomes 
The main secondary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, 
which was used as the primary outcome in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial.  
Additional  secondary  endpoints  were  the  individual  components  of  the  primary  endpoints,  newly 
diagnosed  CHF,  CV  revascularisation  procedures,  newly  diagnosed  diabetes,  cognitive  impairment 
and cognitive decline, new onset of atrial fibrillation and nephropathy.

Inclusion criteria 
Male  or  female  patients,  55 years  of  age  or  older, and  at  high  risk  of  developing  a  major  CV  event 
were eligible if they had any of the following: 
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as: 
a)  Previous  MI  >2  days  post  uncomplicated  MI  prior  to  informed  consent  (as  revascularisation 
procedures during the immediate MI period performed to reduce risk may result in a decreased 
overall  risk  for  the  patient,  eligibility  had  to  be  considered  on  a  case  by  case  basis  in  these 
patients), or; 
b) Stable angina or unstable angina (> 30 days prior to informed consent) each with documented 
multi-vessel coronary disease, > 50% stenosis in at least 2 major coronary arteries on coronary 
angiography,  or  positive  stress  test  (ST  depression  ≥2  mm  or  a  positive  nuclear  perfusion 
scintigram), or; 
c)  Multi-vessel  percutaneous  transluminal  coronary  angioplasty  (PTCA)  >30  days  prior  to 
informed consent, or; 
d)  Multi-vessel  CABG  surgery  without  angina  >4  years  prior  to  informed  consent,  or  with 
recurrent angina following surgery. 
2. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) defined as: 
a) Previous limb bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or; 
b) Previous limb or foot amputation, or; 
c) History of intermittent claudication with an ankle/arm BP ratio δ0.80 on at least one side, or; 
d)  Significant  peripheral  artery  stenosis  (>50%)  documented  by  angiography  or  non-invasive 
testing. 
3.  Previous  stroke  (stroke  included  definite  or  presumed  cerebral  infarction,  intracerebral 
haemorrhage, stroke of uncertain subtype, but not subarachnoid haemorrhage). 
4.  TIA  >7  days  and  <1  year  prior  to  informed  consent  (TIA  was  defined  as  acute  loss  of  focal 
cerebral or monocular function with symptoms lasting <24 hours and which was thought to be 
due  to  inadequate  cerebral  or  ocular  blood  supply  as  a  result  of  arterial  thrombosis  or 
embolism). 
5.  High-risk  diabetes  (insulin-dependent  or  non-insulin-dependent)  with  evidence  of  endorgan 
damage,  i.e.  retinopathy,  LVH,  micro-  or  macroalbuminuria,  or  any  evidence  of  previous 
cardiac or vascular disease. 
Duration of Study 
The planned duration of the maintenance period was 3.5 to 5.5 years. The figure below shows the up-
titration scheme applied in the ONTARGET trial. 
Statistical analysis 
The primary objective consisted of 2 tests, one for superiority of the T/R combination over ramipril 
(null hypothesis: HR T/R vs. R ≥1) and one where non-inferiority of telmisartan versus ramipril was 
5 
 
 
tested  (null  hypothesis:  HR  T  vs.  R  ≥1.13);  multiple  testing  was  accounted  for  by  the  Hochberg 
procedure [R97-1003]. 
Both one-sided hypotheses were tested at the full level alpha = 0.025; both null hypotheses could be 
rejected: 
- if both one-sided p-values were less than 0.025; 
- or (based on CIs) if the two-sided 95% CI around the hazard ratio of T/R vs. R excluded 1, and the 
two-sided 95% CI around the hazard ratio of T vs. R excluded the pre-specified margin of 1.13. This 
margin was chosen to ensure that telmisartan would preserve at least 50% of the effect of ramipril 
over a putative placebo group, based on the results of the HOPE study. 
If  this  was  not  the  case,  but  one  of  the  one-sided  p-values  was  <0.025/2,  then  the  respective  null 
hypothesis could be rejected. Based on CIs, if one of the two-sided 97.5% CIs excluded the relevant 
margin  (1  or  1.13),  then  the  respective  null  hypothesis  could  be  rejected.  If  both  of  these  null 
hypotheses could be rejected at the one-sided multiple level 0.025, a third null hypothesis was to be 
tested.  This  third  null  hypothesis  was  that,  in  the  subgroup  of  diabetic  nephropathy  patients,  the 
combination of telmisartan 80 mg / ramipril 10 mg is equally or less effective than monotherapy with 
ramipril 10 mg in preventing the 3-fold renal endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, progression to 
ESRD (as defined by initiation of dialysis, need for renal transplantation, or eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and all-cause mortality, i.e. that the respective hazard ratio is greater or equal than 1. It was tested 
against the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the hazard ratio is smaller than 1. 
Patient disposition 
A  total  of  29019  patients  were  enrolled  by  732  centres  worldwide.  The  first  patient  was  enrolled  in 
December  2001;  patient  recruitment  ended  in  July  2003.  The  trial  was  completed  (last  patient  last 
seen)  on  29  February  2008.  About  half  of  the  patients  (47.6%)  were  enrolled  by  study  centres  in 
Europe and South Africa; North America contributed 21.5% of enrolled patients, Asia and the Middle 
East 14.7%, Latin America 9.1%, and Australia and New Zealand 7.2%. 
All patients who consented to participate in the study and who were eligible after consideration of the 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  entered  a  run-in  period  and  received  single-blind  treatment.  During 
this  run-in  period  the  doses  of  the  study  medications  were  increased  from  a  daily  dose  of  2.5  mg 
ramipril  for  3 days  to  2.5  mg  ramipril  +  40  mg  telmisartan  for  7  days  to  5  mg  ramipril  +  40  mg 
telmisartan for 11 to 18 days to determine the patient's tolerability to ramipril and telmisartan. Non-
compliant patients were not randomized and patients intolerant to ramipril during the run-in period of 
ONTARGET,  were  not  eligible  for  ONTARGET  but  could  be  enrolled  and  randomised  in  the 
TRANSCEND trial, if they met the entry criteria of TRANSCEND. 
A total of 25620 patients were randomised to either the combination of 80 mg telmisartan and 10 mg 
ramipril  daily  (n=8502),  or  80  mg/day  telmisartan  (n=8542),  or  10  mg/day  ramipril  (n=8576). 
3399 patients (11.7%) were not randomised. The main reasons for nonrandomisation were insufficient 
compliance  (4.6%)  and  the  patient's  request  to  stop  treatment  (5.5%),  persistent  symptomatic 
hypotension  (1.7%),  hyperkalaemia  (0.8%),  or  azotaemia  (0.2%),  or  other  reasons  (4.6%).  These 
included 29 patients (0.1%) who died, 943 patients (3.2%) who experienced adverse events (AEs), and 
397 patients (1.4%) who were not randomised because of administrative reasons. Of the patients who 
were not eligible for randomisation due to an AE, 450 patients (47.7%) had developed cough.  
6 
 
Overall  and  in  all  3  treatment  groups,  99.8%  of  the  randomised  patients  completed  the  trial. 
50 patients (0.2%) did not complete the trial. Of those, 40 patients were lost to follow-up; 10 patients 
refused  to  be  followed  up  for  their  vital  status.  Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the 
randomised patients were similar in the 3 treatment groups. Overall, the mean age was 66.4 years and 
73.3% of patients were male. Most of the patients were of white ethnicity (74.2%); 13.7% of patients 
were  Asian  and  2.5%  were  black.  At  baseline,  hypertension  was  present  in  82.8%  of  patients  and 
diabetes  in  40.9%.  During  the  randomised  period,  the  overall  mean  observation  times  were  about 
4.5 years and comparable between treatment groups. 
A total of 18.2% of all randomised patients permanently discontinued study medication ((both active 
treatment  and  dummy,  T/R:  20.3%;  T:  17.0%;  R:  17.1%,  risk  ratio  T/R  vs.  R:  1.19;  p<0.0001);  no 
difference  was  seen  between  the  telmisartan  and  the  ramipril  groups  (risk  ratio  T  vs.  R:  0.99, 
p=0.8678)).  Of  those  who  permanently  discontinued  study  medication,  53.8%  stopped  treatment 
permanently due to adverse events (T/R: 60.9%; T: 48.1%; R: 51.0%), 3.2% due to SAEs (3.7%, vs. 
3.0% vs. 2.7%). 
Of  the  732  recruiting  study  centres,  350  centres  enrolled  patients  who  were  identified  as  having 
diabetic nephropathy.

Intrinsic factors 
The mean HOPE risk score of patients in this study was 4.076; the 1%-percentile was 3.033 and the 
99%-percentile  was  5.158.  No  relevant  differences  between  treatment  groups  were  observed.  The 
score  accounts  for  the  risk  factors  age,  sex,  smoking,  hypertension,  LVH,  diabetes,  prior  stroke, 
history of PAD and/or ankle/arm SBP <0.9, and history of CAD. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
Diagnosis for study entry 
The  concomitant  medication  was  comparable  between  the  groups.  ASA  was  administered  to  about 
76 % of the patients, statins to 61 – 62%, betablockers to about 57%. Mean baseline blood pressure 
was  also  comparable.  The  overall  mean  sitting  SBP  and  DBP  at  baseline  were  141.8  mmHg  and 
82.1 mmHg, respectively. 
Protocol Amendments 
The  trial  protocol  was  amended  on  3  occasions,  Protocol  Amendment  1.1,  dated  16 July 2002, 
Protocol Amendment 2.1, dated 17 April 2003, and Protocol Amendment 3.1, dated 14 February 2006. 
The changes had generally only minor impact on the conduct of the ONTARGET and TRANSCEND 
studies. 
Results 
The primary endpoint in the ONTARGET trial was defined as the time to first occurrence of non-fatal 
MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death, or hospitalisation for CHF. All outcomes possibly contributing to the 
primary endpoint were to be centrally adjudicated, including all deaths. A total of 8483 primary events 
were  centrally  adjudicated  by  the  Event  Adjudication  Committee,  i.e.  3067  deaths,  1805  MIs,  1487 
strokes,  and  2124  hospitalisations  for  CHF.  Only  3  events  were  not  centrally  adjudicated,  in  these 
cases the assessment of the investigator was used for all analyses.  
At a median follow-up of 56 months, the primary outcome had occurred in 16.5% of the patients in the 
ramipril group, as compared with 16.7% of patients in the telmisartan group (Hazard Ratio 1.01; 95% 
CI, 0.94 to 1.09).

ONTARGET Key results - Incidence of the Primary Outcome, Its Components, and Death from Any 
Cause 
The  decrease  of  blood  pressure  between  the  inclusion  in  the  trial  and  the  end  of  the  trial  were 
6.4/4.3 mmHg in the ramipril group, 7.4/5.0 mmHg in the telmisartan group and 9.8/6.3 mmHg in the 
combination. Patients in the telmisartan group and in the combination-therapy group continued to have 
slightly lower blood pressure levels throughout the study period (average reduction 0.9/0.6 mmHg and 
2.4/1.4 mmHg, respectively). 
Compared  with  the  ramipril  group,  the  telmisartan  group  had  lower  rates  of  cough  (1.1%  vs.  4.2%, 
p<0.001)  and  angioedema  (0.1%  vs.0.3%,  p=0.01)  and  a  higher  rate  of  hypotensive  symptoms,  and 
patients  given  the  combination  treatment  had  higher  rates  of  hypotensive  symptoms,  syncope,  renal 
dysfunction,  and  hyperkalaemia,  with  a  trend  toward  an  increased  risk  of  renal  function  requiring 
dialysis. 
Subgroup analyses 
Overall 30 subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the consistency of the treatment effects in 
various  patient  groups.  For  subgroup  analyses,  the  threshold  p-value  to  indicate  a  subgroup-by-
treatment interaction was set to 0.01 to address the issue of multiplicity of testing and to avoid chance 
findings.  
There were no subgroup-by-treatment interactions in any of the subgroups; all p-values but one were 
above  0.01.  The  exception  was  an  analysis  by  the  proportion  of  visits  with  blood  pressure  below 
140/90 mmHg  (subgroup-by-treatment  interaction  p=0.0018).  The  results  of  this  analysis  were, 
however,  inconclusive.  Subgroups  analyses  for  the  concomitant  use  of  additional  antihypertensive 
medications such as dihydropyridines, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, diuretics, and statins did also not 
show a relevant subgroup-by-treatment interaction (p>0.01). Subgroup analyses were also performed 
for  the  individual  components  of  the  primary  endpoint.  No  subgroup-by-treatment  interaction  was 
observed. The consistency of the treatment effects demonstrates the robustness of the non-inferiority 
of telmisartan in relation to ramipril. 
11 
Comparisons of key subgroups showed similar results between the ramipril group and the telmisartan 
group (Figure A) as well as between the ramipril group and the combination-therapy group (Figure B). 
Telmisartan was equivalent to ramipril in patients with vascular disease or high risk diabetes, and was 
associated  with  a  better  tolerability.  The  risk  score  from  the  Heart  Outcomes  Prevention  Evaluation 
(HOPE) trial ranges from 2.350 to 5.928, with higher scores indicating higher risk. The sizes of the 
squares are proportioned to the numbers of events.  
All-cause mortality 
Overall, 3068 of the randomised patients (12.0%) died during the study. The incidence of death from 
all causes was 12.5% in the T/R combination group, 11.6% in the telmisartan group, and 11.8% in the 
ramipril group. The hazard ratio for the T/R combination versus ramipril was 1.07 (95% CI 0.98, 1.16; 
p=0.1453). The hazard ratio of telmisartan versus ramipril was 0.98 (95% CI 0.90, 1.07; p=0.6378). 
The  predominant  reasons  for  death  were  CV  death  and  malignancies  in  both  the  telmisartan  and 
ramipril treatment groups. 
Comparison ONTARGET and HOPE trial 
As a key secondary endpoint, the composite of CV death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke, which 
had been defined as primary endpoint in the HOPE study, was analysed. Although the ONTARGET 
and  HOPE  studies  had  a  very  similar  trial  design,  some  differences  are  noteworthy.  Eligibility  and 
exclusion criteria differed in some minor aspects between the 2 trials. While not allowed at all in the 
HOPE study, the occurrence of TIA more than 7 days and less than 1 year prior to informed consent 
was permitted in ONTARGET. However, TIA was recorded for only 3.5% of patients in ONTARGET 
at  run-in  and  was  given  as  the  primary  diagnosis  for  study  entry  for  only  2.0%  of  patients.  Patients 
with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% were to be excluded from the HOPE study, while 
they could participate in ONTARGET if not diagnosed with symptomatic heart failure. Patients with 
severe hepatic dysfunction were excluded from the ONTARGET study but were allowed to participate 
in the HOPE trial. 
12 
 
Although  similar  overall,  there  were  some  differences  in  the  patient  populations  included  in  the 
2 trials. In the HOPE study, patients were recruited at centres in North America, South America, and 
Europe,  whereas  for  ONTARGET,  also  Asians  (13.7%)  and  patients  from  Australia/New  Zealand 
(7.1%) were included. The main demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and body mass index 
[BMI]  were  similar  in  the  2  trials.  Mean  baseline  blood  pressures  were  modestly  different  in  the 
2 trials (ONTARGET: 142/82 mmHg; HOPE: 139/79 mmHg). The percentage of current smokers was 
slightly lower in the ONTARGET study (12.6%) than in the HOPE study (14.2%). Other differences 
were noted in the medical history of the randomised patients. In ONTARGET, 68.7% of patients had a 
recorded  medical  history  of  hypertension  compared  with  only  46.8%  in  HOPE.  The  proportion  of 
patients with diabetes recorded as medical history was similar (37.5% vs. 38.5%). Also, the percentage 
of patients with a previous MI was comparable (49.0% vs. 52.6%). Considerably fewer patients with 
stable  angina  (35.0%  vs.  55.5%)  and  unstable  angina  (14.9%  vs.  25.5%)  were  randomised  in 
ONTARGET than in HOPE. A similar percentage of patients in the 2 trials had previously undergone 
coronary  artery bypass  graft  [CABG]  surgery  (22.2%  vs.  25.8%).  However,  PTCA/atherectomy/PCI 
was reported for 29.0% of patients in ONTARGET but for only 17.8% of patients in HOPE.  
The  increased  use  of  revascularisation  procedures  and  CV  medications  would  be  expected  to  have 
resulted in a lower frequency of angina at baseline in ONTARGET than in HOPE, and this was indeed 
observed. The percentage of patients for whom a stroke/TIA was documented at study entry was twice 
as  high  in  ONTARGET  (20.9%)  as  in  the  HOPE  study  (10.9%).  The  HOPE  study  enrolled  patients 
between  December  1993  and  June  1995,  while  the  first  patient  was  enrolled  into  ONTARGET  in 
December  2001.  Hence,  progress  in  the  standard  of  medical  care  for  patients  at  high  risk  for 
cardiovascular events was observed. This was most pronounced for the use of lipid-lowering agents. In 
13 
 
ONTARGET  62%  of  patients  took  statins  concomitantly;  the  percentage  increased  to  over  70%  at 
study end. In contrast, in the HOPE study, only 29% of patients took lipid-lowering agents (statins and 
other drug classes). Betablocker use was also more common in ONTARGET than in HOPE (56.9% vs. 
39.5%).  The  incidence  of  the  3-fold  endpoint  in  ONTARGET  was  similar  for  all  3  treatments 
(T/R: 14.1%; T: 13.9%, R: 14.1%) as were the event rates per 100 patient years. Consequently, hazard 
ratios  were  close  to  1.  The  incidence  of  the  3-fold  endpoint  in  patients  treated  with  ramipril  was 
similar  in  ONTARGET  and  HOPE  (14.1%  vs.  14.0%)  although  the  average  observation  time  was 
longer in ONTARGET. The observation time-adjusted event rate per 100 PY for ramipril was 3.51 in 
HOPE  compared  with  3.23  observed  in  ONTARGET.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  for  the 
3-fold  endpoint.  The  analyses  based  on  the  per-protocol  population  (one-sided  non-inferiority 
p=0.0041)  and  based  on  the  patients  who  had  remained  on  10  mg/day  ramipril  throughout  the  trial 
(one-sided  non-inferiority  p=0.0014)  confirmed  the  findings  of  the  initial  analysis.  Adjustment  for 
baseline  SBP  (HR  1.04;  95%  CI  1.02,  1.06)  as  well  as  for  SBP  over  time  (HR  1.02;  95%  CI  1.01, 
1.04) showed that the results for the 3-fold endpoint were largely independent of differences in SBP 
between treatments (one-sided non-inferiority p=0.0014).  
A summary is provided in Table 2.5.4.1: 3 below. 
For  the  4-fold  primary  endpoint,  the  hazard  ratio  of  ramipril  versus  placebo  in  the  HOPE  trial  was 
0.775 (95% CIs 0.704, 0.854), for telmisartan versus placebo a hazard ratio of 0.785 (95% CI 0.695, 
0.887)  was  calculated.  For  the  3-fold  endpoint  (without  CHF),  the  hazard  ratio  of  ramipril  versus 
placebo was 0.780 (95% CI 0.700, 0.860) and for telmisartan versus placebo a hazard ratio of 0.770 
(95% CI 0.675, 0.877) was calculated. 
Additional analyses were performed for the individual components of the composite primary endpoint 
including  all  MIs  and  strokes  irrespective  of  whether  the  event  was  fatal  or  not.  The  most  frequent 
event in ONTARGET was CV death (7.1%) followed by MI (5.0%), stroke (4.5%), and hospitalisation 
for  CHF  (4.2%).  No  meaningful  differences  in  risk  reduction  were  observed  between  treatments  for 
any  of  the  individual  components.  Further  CV  endpoints  included  newly  diagnosed  CHF,  CV 
revascularisation  procedures,  new  onset  of  atrial  fibrillation,  angina  (stable,  unstable,  new,  and 
worsening),  and  TIA.  Again,  no  relevant  differences  between  treatments  for  these  endpoints  were 
detected.

Discussion ONTARGET 
The  ONTARGET  trial  compared  monotherapy  with  ramipril  10  mg,  telmisartan  80  mg  and  a 
combination of both in a group of patients at high CV risk. Superiority of the combination could not 
be demonstrated and, on the contrary, a numerically higher rate of all-cause mortality, CV mortality 
and  of  AEs  and  SAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuations  were  associated  with  the  use  of  the 
combination. However, the combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not relevant for this application. 
The predefined criteria for non inferiority were met for the comparison of telmisartan and ramipril for 
the primary endpoint (4-fold composite). The results for the secondary endpoints are consistent with 
the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  The  findings  cannot  be  extrapolated  to  lower  doses  and  therefore  the 
posology needs to reflect the dosing regimen used in the study. 
The  design  of  the  study  to  compare  telmisartan  and  ramipril  was  based  on  the  results  of  the  HOPE 
study  that  was  used  to  estimate  an  expected  treatment  effect  for  ramipril.  This  is  necessary  in 
situations, where a placebo control cannot be included. However, this relies on the estimate from the 
historical  study  remaining  valid  which  is  frequently  questionable  because  of  changes  in  the  patient 
population  and  clinical  practice.  There  were  relevant  differences  between  the  HOPE-  and  the 
ONTARGET population e.g. with respect to the presence of hypertension, stable angina, PTCA/PCI, 
Stroke/TIA and the baseline medication (betablockers, statins). Especially the higher use of statins and 
betablockers  in  ONTARGET  may  have  decreased  the  overall  event  rate  and  potentially  reduced  the 
magnitude of the ramipril effect.  
Further discussion regarding the chosen non-inferiority margin and the assumption of constancy (i.e. 
that  the  ramipril  effect  versus  placebo  in  HOPE  remains  relevant  for  the  ONTARGET  study)  also 
considering the submitted supportive data can be found in the Overall discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
below. 
1.4 Supporting evidence - TRANSCEND trial 
The  TRANSCEND  trial  (Telmisartan  Randomised  AssessmeNt  Study  in  ACE-I  iNtolerant  subjects 
with cardiovascular Disease) trial (n=5926) investigated the efficacy of telmisartan 80 mg vs. placebo 
in addition to standard treatment in the prevention of morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk 
for vascular events, who are intolerant to ACE-I.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as in ONTARGET, but only patients intolerant to 
ACE-Is were included and patients with clinically significant proteinuria were excluded. The primary 
composite 4-fold endpoint was identical to the primary endpoint in ONTARGET (Composite of CV 
death, MI, stroke, or hospitalisation for CHF).  
The  primary  endpoint  occurred  in  15.7%  (T)  and  17.0%  (PBO)  of  patients;  the  event  rates  per 
100 patient  years  [PY]  were  3.58  and  3.87,  respectively,  with  a  resulting  hazard  ratio  of  telmisartan 
versus  placebo  of  0.92  (95%  CI  0.81,  1.05;  p=0.2192).  Thus  the  trial  was  not  able  to  demonstrate 
superiority of telmisartan over placebo given on top of standard care. 
A  post-hoc  power  calculation  showed  that  to  confidently  establish  a  difference  between  telmisartan 
and placebo in the 4-fold endpoint based on the event rates observed in the TRANSCEND trial, some 
28000  patients  would  have  been  needed  to  achieve  a  power  of  80%.  Hence  the  study  was 
insufficiently  powered  to  demonstrate  a  relative  risk  reduction  of  8%  for  telmisartan  in  the  primary 
4-fold endpoint. 
Results published from the TRANSCEND study, showed that although telmisartan had no significant 
effect on the primary outcome, which included hospitalisation for HF, it modestly reduces the risk of a 
composite outcome of CV death, MI, or stroke. 
The composite 3-fold endpoint of MI, stroke, and CV death was analysed as a key secondary endpoint 
in the TRANSCEND trial. For this endpoint the incidence was significantly lower in the telmisartan 
group (13.0%) than in the placebo group (14.8%); the hazard ratio for this comparison was 0.87 (95% 
CI 0.76, 1.00; p=0.0483).  
The MAH stated that the apparent lack of a difference between telmisartan and placebo with regard to 
the incidence of hospitalisation for CHF (HR: 1.05; 95% CI 0.82, 1.34; p=0.6940) may be related to 
15 
 
 
the  higher  concomitant  use  of  effective  medication  in  the  placebo  group  (at  study  end:  diuretics  T: 
33.7% vs. PBO 40.0%; calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridines) excluding diltiazem/verapamil T: 
30.8% vs. PBO: 39.2%).  
A  retrospective  comparison  showed  that  the  event  rates  in  the  placebo  group  of  the  HOPE  trial  had 
been substantially higher than in the placebo group of the TRANSCEND trial. For the 4-fold endpoint, 
the  event  rate  had  been  5.09  (per  100  PY)  in  the  HOPE  trial  whereas  it  was  only  3.87  in 
TRANSCEND. Similarly for the 3-fold endpoint, the event rates were 4.53 versus 3.33, respectively. 
The differences in the composite endpoints between the placebo groups in the trials were largely due 
to substantially higher event rates for MI (HOPE 3.06 vs. TRANSCEND 1.09). 
Telmisartan was well tolerated in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors (in particular, 377 patients had 
experienced in the past serious reactions to ACE-I).    
TRANSCEND Discussion 
The TRANSCEND trial did not formally demonstrate superiority of telmisartan over placebo given on 
top  of  standard  care  in  patients  intolerant  to  ACE-Is.  TRANSCEND  study  findings  showed  that  the 
primary outcome (composite 4-fold endpoint) did not differ significantly between the telmisartan and 
placebo groups. Since the incidence of the primary endpoint (4-fold composite endpoint) was 15.7% 
for  telmisartan  80  mg  and  17%  for  placebo  [HR  =  0.92  with  95%CI  (0.81;  1.05)]  the  study  is 
considered not conclusive. When HF hospitalization was omitted from the composite outcome (3-fold 
composite endpoint), the result was in favour of telmisartan (13% in the telmisartan group compared 
to 14.8% in the placebo group (14.8%) with a hazard ratio for this comparison of 0.87 (95% CI 0.76, 
1.00; p=0.0483)). 
During the Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory Group (CV-SAG) meeting the relevance of the 3-fold 
as compared to the 4-fold combined cardiovascular endpoint was discussed. Experts in methodology 
of clinical trials raised concerns because the  primary endpoint in TRANSCEND formally failed and 
they  considered  that  in  this  case  the  secondary  endpoint  cannot  be  analysed.  For  this  reason  the 
statisticians  considered  the  3-fold  secondary  endpoint,  although  indeed  identical  to  the  primary 
endpoint  in  HOPE  study,  not  adequate  for  confirmatory  conclusions  from  data  of  TRANSCEND. 
They  strongly  supported  the  position  that  the  post  hoc  exclusion  of  heart  failure  from  the  primary 
analysis in knowledge of the data is not appropriate irrespective of the claimed indication. The SAG 
chairman,  however,  underlined  that  the  main  secondary  end  point  was  a  pre-specified  end  point. 
Further, the general opinion of clinical experts present at the SAG was that both endpoints were rather 
similar.  Some  experts  mentioned  however  that  although  the  3-fold  composite  endpoint  is  clinically 
relevant, it is not as relevant as the 4-fold endpoint. 
TRANSCEND  cannot  formally  be  considered  a  positive  study  demonstrating  superiority  of 
telmisartan versus placebo and the only moderate numerical difference in the TRANSCEND trial has 
put a further question mark on the assumptions of the treatment effect of ramipril in the ONTARGET 
trial.  The  baseline  characteristics  of  the  patients  are  almost  identical.  Assuming  the  true  treatment 
effect in this population and in the ONTARGET population is around 8% the appropriateness of the 
predefined  non-inferiority  margin  in  ONTARGET  is  questionable.  Reference  is  made  to  the  overall 
discussion on clinical efficacy for further details (see below). 
1.5 Supporting evidence - PRoFESS Trial 
PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes: A double-blind, active and 
placebo controlled study of Aggrenox→ vs. clopidogrel, with and without Micardis) investigated the 
role  of  telmisartan  versus  placebo,  on  top  of  standard  antiplatelet  therapy  in  the  prevention  of 
secondary stroke.  
Objectives:  
To  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  product  Aspirin  plus  extended-
release dipyridamole (Aggrenox, ASA+ER-DP) with that of clopidogrel and to compare the efficacy 
and safety of telmisartan with that of placebo in the prevention of recurrent stroke.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
Male or female patients aged at least 50 years who had suffered an ischaemic stroke within 120 days 
prior to study entry and who were neurologically and clinically stable were enrolled in this study. 
20332 patients were included, amongst them 10146 were in the telmisartan arm and were assigned to 
receive  80 mg 
telmisartan  daily.  At  baseline  74%  had  hypertension,  28%  diabetes,  46% 
hyperlipidemia, and 67% received other antihypertensive medications. At baseline the mean BP was 
144.1/83.8 mmHg, and the mean difference along the trial between the telmisartan and placebo arms 
was 3.59/1.65 mmHg.  
Results 
After 2.5 years of follow-up the primary outcome occurred for 873 patients (8.6%) in the telmisartan 
arm,  and  for  924  patients  (9.1%)  in  the  placebo  arm  (HR  0.95,  95%  CI:  0.86,  1.04;  p=0.2621). 
Therefore the numerical difference in favour of telmisartan was not statistically significant. 
The  major  haemorrhagic  events  occurred  for  377  patients  in  the  telmisartan  arm  versus  400  in  the 
placebo  arm  (HR  0.95,  95%  CI:  0.83,  1.10;  p=0.49).  For  the  Intracranial  bleeds  the  HR  was  0.81, 
numerically in favour of telmisartan (95% CI: 0.62-1.04; p=0.0972). 
The  composite  4-fold  endpoint  of  MI,  stroke,  CV  death,  and  hospitalisation  due  to  CHF,  was 
investigated  as  secondary  endpoint  to  allow  potential  comparisons  with  the  results  of  the  other 
telmisartan outcome trials. The 3-fold composite endpoint of MI, stroke, and CV death was analysed 
post hoc to provide a link to the results in the ONTARGET, TRANSCEND, and HOPE studies.  
The  randomisation  in  the  PRoFESS  trial  was  stratified  by  ACE-I  use  at  baseline;  overall,  37.0%  of 
patients had been using ACE-Is at study entry. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of the 4-fold composite 
endpoint  (MI,  stroke,  CV  death,  hospitalisation  for  CHF)  based  on  all  patients  separated  by 
concomitant  ACE-Is  use  during  the  study  was  performed.  In  patients  who  did  not  use  ACE-Is,  the 
4-fold endpoint occurred in 11.6% (T) and 13.1% (PBO) of patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (95% 
CI 0.79, 0.97); the p-value for the subgroup-by-treatment interaction was 0.0527. Similarly, the 3-fold 
composite  endpoint  occurred  in  11.2%  (T)  and  12.6%  (PBO)  of  patients  with  a  hazard  ratio  of 
0.88 (95% CI 0.79, 0.98); the p-value for the subgroup-by-treatment interaction was 0.0624.  
This  study  has  provided  relevant  safety  data  on  telmisartan  in  patients  with  a  previous  stroke.  Data 
show that therapy with telmisartan initiated soon after an ischemic stroke and continued for 2.5 years, 
do not significantly decrease the rate of recurrent stroke, major cardiovascular events, or diabetes (see 
safety section below).  
17 
PRoFESS Discussion 
The results of this study have limited relevance for this application as the primary endpoint was the 
recurrence  of  stroke,  only  one  component  of  the  composite  endpoint  chosen  in  ONTARGET. 
Furthermore, the results of the study were influenced by the factorial design used to assess the effect 
of  two  different  antiplatelet  therapies;  this  design  reduced  the  overall  power  in  the  comparison 
between  telmisartan  and  placebo;  there  was  a  time-by-treatment  interaction,  there  were  significant 
differences in the blood pressure between the groups.  
The  primary  endpoint  did  not  reveal  a  statistically  significant  result  without  further  statistical 
calculations.  The  relevant  secondary  composite  endpoint  did  not  show  a  significant  benefit  of 
telmisartan  as  compared  to  placebo.  Only  after  post  hoc  analyses  a  difference  could  be  shown. 
Furthermore, the primary endpoint (stroke) is only one component of the composite endpoint chosen 
in ONTARGET. Therefore, the data can only be used as supporting evidence. 
1.6 Supporting evidence - a pooled analysis of TRANSCEND and PRoFESS for patients 
not using ACE-Is ('Total/NoACE-I population') 
To investigate the effectiveness of telmisartan in comparison with placebo in the prevention of major 
cardiovascular  events  in  patients  who  did  not  use  ACE-Is,  the  respective  patient  cohorts  from  the 
TRANSCEND  study  (contributing  about  1/3)  and  the  PRoFESS  trial  (contributing  about  2/3)  were 
pooled.  The  resulting  "total/NoACE-I"  population  comprised  16877  patients  (T:  n=8587,  PBO: 
n=8290).  
For  the  analyses  of  the  pooled  data  across  relevant  study  populations,  essentially  the  same 
methodology  as  pre-specified  for  ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  was  used.  No  new  combined 
endpoints  were  defined.  The  4-fold  endpoint  was  pre-specified  in  PRoFESS;  the  3-fold  HOPE 
endpoint was not pre-specified in PRoFESS, but was used for the post-hoc analyses as pre-specified 
for ONTARGET and TRANSCEND.

In both trials, patients were randomly assigned to telmisartan (n=8587) or placebo (n=8290). Of these 
13.0% (T) and 14.4% (PBO) reached the composite 4-fold endpoint. The hazard ratio for telmisartan 
versus  placebo  was  0.90  (95%  CI  0.83,  0.98);  the  p-value  of  0.0107  demonstrated  superiority  of 
telmisartan over placebo in this pooled population.  
Likewise, for the 3-fold endpoint, the incidences were 11.8% (T) and 13.3% (PBO), the hazard ratio 
was  0.88  (95%  CI  0.81,  0.96),  and  the  p-value  of  0.0029  indicated  superiority of  telmisartan  in  this 
population.  
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis for the 4-fold composite endpoint using data from all patients who 
had not taken ACE-Is at baseline in the PRoFESS and TRANSCEND trials (n=18739) was conducted. 
Such an analysis would not be affected by any post-randomisation decisions to add ACE-Is during the 
trial which could introduce bias. This analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.86, 1.00) with 
a p=0.0422 and thus confirmed the results seen in the total/NoACE-I population (i.e., no ACE-I at any 
time  during  a  study).  Furthermore,  if  data  from  the  complete  trial  populations  of  both  the 
TRANSCEND and the PRoFESS trials are combined, irrespective of ACE-I use (n=26258), a positive 
effect  of  telmisartan  could  still  be  demonstrated  (HR  0.93;  95%  CI  0.87,  0.99,  p=0.0297),  albeit  of 
smaller magnitude, as would be expected.

For  the  total/NoACE-I  population,  a  significant  treatment-by-time-period  interaction  (≤6 months, 
>6 months) was observed for both the 4-fold (p=0.0151) and the 3-fold (p=0.0178) endpoints. For the 
period exceeding 6 months, the hazard ratio for the 4-fold endpoint was 0.85 (95% CI 0.78, 0.94); for 
the 3-fold endpoint, the hazard ratio was 0.83 (95% CI 0.75, 0.92) indicating relative risk reductions in 
favour  of  telmisartan  of  15%  and  17%,  respectively.  This  implies  that  prolonged  treatment  with 
telmisartan  increases  the  protective  effect  in  comparison  with  placebo.  A  time-dependent  effect  was 
also observed in the individual trials (TRANSCEND, PRoFESS). 
In the course of the studies, a substantial reduction in blood pressure was observed in both treatment 
groups;  the  individual  mean  SBP/DBP  changes  post  randomisation  were  −8.9/−5.1  mmHg  in  the 
telmisartan group and −4.3/−2.7 mmHg in the placebo group. 
Pooled Analyses discussion 
The  supportive  placebo  controlled  efficacy  data  are  primarily  based  on  a  post-hoc  meta-analysis  in 
which,  patients  from  the  TRANSCEND  and  the  PRoFESS  studies,  who  did  not  use  ACE-Is,  were 
pooled. The vast majority of the patients in the meta-analysis had participated in the PRoFESS study. 
However, large differences exists in relevant medical history, concomitant medication and tobacco use 
(highlighted  in  table  1  above)  between  the  PRoFESS  and  the  ONTARGET/TRANSCEND  study 
populations. In addition, the objective of the PRoFESS study was different from the objectives of the 
ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  studies.  In  fact,  time  to  composite  of  stroke,  MI  or  death  due  to 
vascular  causes  (HOPE)  was  a  post-hoc  defined  endpoint.  Therefore,  the  pooled  analysis  is  not 
persuasive as trials with heterogeneous objectives and patient populations are pooled and a subgroup 
of  interest  is  not  prospectively  identified.  Adjustments  for  multiple  testing  are  not  implemented  and 
the results may anyway not be regarded as providing considerable statistical evidence. Formally, the 
level of evidence does not meet the standards outlined in the CHMP guidance for accepting data from 
meta-analyses  “points  to  consider  on  application  with  1.  Meta-analyses;  2.  One  pivotal  study” 
(CPMP/EWP2330/99).  
During the review of the application the MAH clarified that the analysis was not considered to provide 
a  formal  meta-analysis  in  the  sense  of  the  above  mentioned  guideline  as  the  ONTARGET  study  is 
considered the main body of evidence. However, the MAH considered this information as important 
supportive  evidence  because  this  analysis  provides  information  on  about  16000  patients  at  high 
cardiovascular risk. 
Furthermore, the MAH has performed an additional analysis based on an adapted HOPE risk score to 
describe  the  similarity  of  the  study  populations.  The  mean  adapted  HOPE  score  was  comparable 
between  ONTARGET,  TRANSCEND,  and  PRoFESS  (see  Table  2:1).  The  MAH  provided 
justification on the use of the adapted HOPE score and considered the similarity of the adapted HOPE 
cardiovascular  risk  score  and  the  similarity  of  the  patient  populations  as  sufficient  justification  to 
perform a pooled analysis.

The MAH stated that additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the 
main Total/NoACE-I analyses which excluded the concomitant use of ACE-Is and ARBs at any time. 
One  analysis  included  only  the  patients  as  stratified  by  ACE-I  use  at  baseline,  a  second  sensitivity 
analysis  included  all  patients  in  PRoFESS  and  TRANSCEND,  irrespective  of  ACE-I  use,  and  both  
demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of telmisartan over placebo. Other sensitivity analyses, 
e.g. to assess the influence of blood pressure, were also performed in analogy with the pre-specified 
analyses  in  ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND.  Analyses  that  were  not  pre-specified  had  exploratory 
character. For instance, the additional analysis of the Total/NoACE-I population that showed that the 
effect of telmisartan became prominent after a lag-phase of about 6 months is considered exploratory.  
It is questionable, from the CHMP point of view, whether the information derived from this analysis 
provides  information  beyond  the  information  that  can  be  drawn  from  the  single  two  studies 
(TRANSCEND  and  PRoFESS).  Taking  the  data  together  does  not  eliminate  the  problems  inherited 
from  the  single  studies.  Furthermore,  the  analysis  mainly  reflects  the  Non-ACE-patients  from 
PRoFESS trial and has mainly the inherited problems such as the two-by-two design. 
Independent of the mode of the different kinds of calculation (3-fold and 4-fold endpoint, No-ACE-
Inhibitor at all, No ACE-Inhibitor at entry, irrespectively of ACE-Inhibitor use, HR 0.90, 0.88, 0.92, 
0.93) all of the results are consistent with the assumption that an expected treatment effect should be 
much less than the 22% seen in the HOPE study. Furthermore, the analysis of all-cause mortality in a 
pooled analysis did not reveal any positive effect of telmisartan but even a slight numerical difference 
in favour of placebo. 
In conclusion, the pooled analysis does not significantly contribute additional information beyond the 
information that can be derived from the single studies. Statistical significance in the pooled analysis 
should be interpreted with caution. 
1.7 All-cause mortality 
All-cause mortality was analysed as a tertiary efficacy endpoint in ONTARGET, TRANSCEND, and 
PRoFESS.  In  none  of  the  three  trials  was  there  any  clear  indication  of  an  excess  risk  of  death  with 
telmisartan,  apart  from  small  numerical  differences  between  the  treatment  groups,  not  indicative  of 
clinically meaningful differences.  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
In  TRANSCEND  the  incidence  of  all-cause  mortality  was  12.3%  (telmisartan)  vs.  11.7% 
(placebo) with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.22).  
In  PRoFESS  the  incidence  of  all-cause  mortality  was  7.4%  (telmisartan)  vs.  7.3%  (placebo) 
with a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.14).  
In  ONTARGET  the  incidence  of  all-cause  mortality  was  11.6%  (telmisartan)  vs.  11.8% 
(ramipril) with a hazard ratio of 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.07). 
In the placebo-controlled study TRANSCEND, a total of 713 patients died in the course of this study, 
364  patients  (12.3%)  in  the  telmisartan  treatment  group  and  349  patients  (11.7%)  in  the  placebo 
treatment group. It should be noted that the proportion of TRANSCEND patients taking other cardio-
protective  medications  (i.e.,  beta  blockers  and  diuretics)  at  the  end  of  the  trial  was  higher  in  the 
placebo group than in the telmisartan group (see Table 2: 1).

The  MAH  argued  that  this  was  a  very  likely  consequence  of  the  investigators  using  guideline 
recommended strategies to attain goal blood pressure levels in the placebo group, but also likely had 
the effect of reducing the outcome events in the “placebo group”, which in reality was a “placebo plus 
other  guideline  driven  medications  to  reduce  total  CV  risk  group”.  The  results  of  the  time-to-event 
analysis of death from any cause (including CV death and non-CV death) in all patients randomised in 
TRANSCEND is shown in Figure 2:1. The curves of the 2 treatments (telmisartan, placebo) are almost 
overlapping for most of the trial suggesting there is no difference in all-cause mortality between the 
two treatment groups.  
Figure 2: 1 
Kaplan Meier estimates for death of any cause in TRANSCEND 
All  deaths  in  the  TRANSCEND  trial  were  centrally  adjudicated  for  the  occurrence  of  CV  death  by 
blinded  experts.  Investigators  were  asked  to  record  the  primary  cause  of  death  on  the  Death  Report 
Form (CRF 99), which had pre-specified categories. If the primary cause of death did not fall into one 
of  the  pre-specified  categories,  the  investigator  was  to  give  the  cause  of  death  in  a  free-text  field 
(under 'other'). The incidence of cardiovascular death was very similar between the treatment groups 
while  there  was  a  small  difference  in  non-cardiovascular  deaths.  The  incidences  of  deaths  due  to 
malignancies  were  again  similar  (T: [66 patients]  2.2%  vs.  PBO  [67  patients]  2.3%).  The  difference 
between the treatment groups is due to differences in the category of "other causes" of death. In the 
telmisartan group 71 patients (2.4%) had a reason for death that was categorised as "other" compared 
with 58 causes of death in the placebo group (2.0%).

In the placebo-controlled trial PRoFESS, all-cause mortality was analysed as another tertiary endpoint, 
also employing a Cox proportional hazards regression as for the primary endpoint. Table 2:3 shows no 
meaningful difference in the number of deaths between the two groups as indicated by the hazard ratio 
and 95% CI.

The results above are substantiated by taking the incidence of all-cause mortality in the pooled patient 
population of TRANSCEND and PRoFESS who did not take ACE-I at any time during the trials and 
the  patients  in  ONTARGET  (comparison  telmisartan  against  ramipril)  into  account.  In  the  pooled 
analysis, 788 (9.2%) of patients died in the telmisartan group vs. 745 (9.0%) of patients who died in 
the placebo group, resulting in a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI 0.93, 1.13).  
In the ONTARGET trial, of the 3068 randomised patients, 989 patients died in the telmisartan group 
and 1014 patients died in the ramipril group (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% CI 0.90, 1.07).  
It is worthwhile to note that in the VALIANT study, a minimally higher mortality rate was shown for 
the  valsartan  arm  (19.9%)  compared  with  the  captopril  arm  (19.5%);  nevertheless  the  overall  study 
results  demonstrated  that  valsartan  is  non-inferior  to  captopril  in  reducing  the  risk  of  death  in  the 
patient population studied.  
Discussion All-cause mortality 
Although in the ONTARGET pivotal trial, mortality was numerically lower in the telmisartan group 
compared  to  the  ramipril  group,  the  two  placebo  controlled  trials  do  not  indicate  that  there  is  any 
beneficial effect of telmisartan with regard to all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was numerically 
increased  as  compared  to placebo.  This  result  was  consistent  for CV  death  and  non  CV death.  Also 
CV death was numerically higher with telmisartan in TRANSCEND (7.7 vs. 7.5%). 
Given these results it is not possible to conclude that telmisartan has a beneficial effect neither on all-
cause  mortality  nor  on  CV  mortality.  Considering  that  the  treatment  effect  in  the  ONTARGET 
population may have changed as compared to the HOPE study and considering that the result on the 
heart  failure  component  in  ONTARGET  was  also  different  to  the  result  in  HOPE,  the  data  do  not 
allow  to  conclude  that  similar  results  in  ONTARGET  for  mortality  in  the  two  groups  indicate  a 
beneficial effect of both medicinal products. 
The view of the SAG from a clinical perspective was, taking the totality of the data into account, that 
there is a treatment effect, although it cannot be reliably estimated in terms of effect size as compared 
to  placebo.  In  the  opinion  of  the  majority  of  the  Group,  the  undertaken  studies  do  not  show  that 
telmisartan improves either all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. It was noted however that 
mortality was only one of the variables of the combined end-point. 
One of the clinical experts was of the opinion that the benefits for patients were not clearly established 
because  the  benefit  is  to  be  expected  considerably  smaller  than  in  HOPE  and  the  signals  from  the 
supporting studies are more disturbing than assuring. However, on the other hand SAG admitted that 
the use of telmisartan does not seem to result in any increase of cardiovascular mortality.  
The CHMP considered that a claim for improvement in CV mortality cannot be based on the results 
from the submitted studies. 
1.8 Overall Discussion Clinical Efficacy  
The pivotal efficacy trial in this submission is the ONTARGET study. The predefined criteria for non 
inferiority were  met for the comparison of telmisartan and ramipril for the primary endpoint (4-fold 
composite endpoint of MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, and hospitalisation for CHF). The upper limit 
of  the  97.5%  confidence  interval  for  the  hazard  ratio  of  telmisartan  versus  ramipril  was  below  the 
protocol-specified non-inferiority margin. A similar result was also seen for the key secondary 3-fold 
endpoint  of  MI,  stroke,  and  cardiovascular  death.  The  results  for  the  4-fold  and  for  the  3-fold 
endpoints when analysed to adjust for changes in systolic blood pressure were basically unchanged. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall results were also consistent with those observed in most of the 30 analysed subgroups.  
The design of the study to compare telmisartan and ramipril in the ONTARGET study was based on 
the results of the HOPE study that was used to estimate an expected treatment effect for ramipril. This 
is  necessary  in  situations,  where  a  placebo  control  cannot  be  included.  However,  this  relies  on  the 
estimate from the historical study remaining valid which is frequently questionable because of changes 
in  the  patient  population  and  clinical  practice.  Referring  to  historical  data  requires  hypotheses, 
especially  the  constancy  of  the  effect  over  time  of  the  chosen  comparator  (ramipril  here).  For 
ONTARGET the historical effect of ramipril in the HOPE study (treatment benefit of 22% of ramipril 
over  placebo  for  the  primary  endpoint)  was  used.  The  actual  treatment  effect  of  ramipril  in 
ONTARGET  is  unknown.  Furthermore,  there  are  some  relevant  differences  between  the  HOPE 
population  and  the  ONTARGET  population  (e.g.  higher  use  of  statins  and  betablockers  in 
ONTARGET) that could influence the overall result and affect the validity of a straightforward cross 
trial comparison. Moreover, the TRANSCEND study included in a placebo controlled design a patient 
population  that  was  almost  identical  to  the  population  in  ONTARGET  but  did  not  demonstrate  a 
superior efficacy of telmisartan over placebo for the primary endpoint. These considerations had raised 
concerns regarding the acceptance of the choice of the noninferiority margin (1.13) in ONTARGET. 
The key point of the discussion is that the placebo controlled effect of ramipril seen in the HOPE study 
might  not  be  transferable  to  the  ONTARGET  population  and  is  presumably  considerably  lower. 
Therefore,  a  non-inferiority  margin  set  at  50%  of  the  effect  in  the  HOPE  study  might  not  be 
appropriate  to  demonstrate  that  the  effect  of  ramipril  is  preserved.  Taking  as  an  example  the 
assumption of the MAH (13% effect of ramipril) the study was not able demonstrate that at least 50% 
of the effect of ramipril (required non-inferiority margin in this case: 7.5%) is preserved. In fact it was 
questionable, whether a 13% difference in comparison to placebo can actually be assumed based on 
the  clinical  program.  The  TRANSCEND  study  failed  to  show  a  statistically  significant  effect  of 
telmisartan  vs.  placebo  for  the  primary  endpoint.  Numerically  the  difference  was  only  8%.  In  the 
PROFESS study the numerical difference achieved was even smaller (HR 0.94) for both the 3-fold and 
the 4-fold endpoint. All-cause mortality was numerically increased in both studies, when compared to 
placebo:  (12.3  vs.  11.7  and  7.4  vs.  7.2%),  which  was  by  far  different  from  the  numerical  16% 
reduction in mortality seen in HOPE. Taking the data of the two placebo controlled studies together 
the  3-fold  and  4-fold  endpoints  indicated  a  numerical  risk  reduction  by  only  6  –  13%.  All-cause 
mortality was consistently numerically increased by about 3 – 5% as compared to placebo. Based on 
these considerations the clinical relevance of an achievable effect nowadays is considerably less clear 
than at the time of the HOPE study. The improved standard of care might be a plausible explanation 
for the only borderline significant effect that is observed for telmisartan in the TRANSCEND study as 
it is nowadays more difficult to show superiority of a medicinal product on top of current best standard 
of care. 
During the assessment the CHMP raised concerns with respect to the verification of assay sensitivity 
of  the  ONTARGET  trial  as  the  assumptions  underpinning  the  putative  placebo  comparison  remain 
questionable.  In  addition,  concerns  were  expressed  by  the  Committee  why  the  evidence  for  non-
inferiority  from  ONTARGET  is  adequate  to  establish  (i)  indirect  superiority  to  placebo  and  (ii) 
absence of a clinically important difference compared to ramipril. This was based on the fact that the 
result  for  telmisartan  vs.  placebo  in  the  TRANSCEND  study  with  an  almost  identical  patient 
population  was  formally  negative  for  the  primary  composite  endpoint.  The  resulting  hazard  ratio  of 
telmisartan versus placebo was 0.92 and 0.87 depending on the endpoint, indicating a treatment effect 
of broadly similar magnitude to that selected for the non-inferiority margin for ONTARGET.  
In  the  following  the  MAH  arguments  regarding  these  concerns  are  outlined  as  presented  during  the 
procedure. 
Assay sensitivity 
The MAH argued that in general, assay sensitivity in a non-inferiority design trial can be demonstrated 
by  differences  with  regard  to  secondary  endpoints,  differences  in the  observed safety  profiles  of  the 
treatments, or by any other established difference. For the ONTARGET trial, the apparent absence of 
substantial differences between the treatment groups in a number of efficacy endpoints may be related 
to  the  fact  that  the  trial  tested  2  medications  (i.e.  telmisartan  and  ramipril)  that  affect  the  same 
the  renin-angiotension-aldesterone  system  (RAAS). 
physiological  response  cascade,  namely 
24 
Nevertheless,  there  are  a  number  of  observations  in  the  ONTARGET  trial  that  the  MAH  claimed 
demonstrate  that  trial  design  and  conduct  were  sensitive  to  the  differential  effects  of  the  treatments 
administered:  
a) the differences observed in regard to premature discontinuations from the trial because this is an 
important parameter for long-term tolerability,  
b)  the  differential  effect  of  the  treatments  on  the  albumine-creatinine  ratio  because  it  had  been 
hypothesized,  prior  to  the  ONTARGET  trial,  that  a  dual  blockade  of  RAAS  would  not  only 
provide a more substantial risk reduction for major cardiovascular events but would also have a 
more pronounced renoprotective effect than treatment with a single RAAS blocking agent,  
c) the incidences of adverse events associated with the use of ramipril, and 
d) the statistical significant differences in the 3-fold endpoint in favour of telmisartan over placebo in 
the TRANSCEND study. 
With regard to safety the MAH argued that a differential effect of the treatments and hence sensitivity 
could be demonstrated (see safety section below). In line with the expectations, substantial differences 
were observed in the incidences of cough and angioedema, adverse events that are associated with the 
use  of  ramipril.  Treatment  discontinuations  because  of  cough  and  the  risks  to  develop  cough  were 
significantly higher in both the T/R combination group and the ramipril group. 
Similarly,  although  angioedema  was  a  rare  event,  the  exposure-adjusted  incidences  for  angioedema 
and  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  were  lower  in  the  telmisartan  group  than  in  the  ramipril 
group.  
Additional  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  pooled  placebo  population  were  performed.  However,  albeit 
placebo  controlled,  neither  PRoFESS  nor  TRANSCEND  were  able  to  demonstrate  a  significant 
benefit for telmisartan. The conclusions that can be drawn from PRoFESS are largely limited due to 
the 2x2 design. In addition, there were relevant differences in arterial blood pressure. Only by post hoc 
analyses a treatment effect could be calculated. 
The MAH stated that the overall results were consistent in a number of sensitivity analyses including 
evaluations of the per-protocol set and the patients who had received the full dose of ramipril (i.e., 10 
mg/day) throughout the trial. 
Indirect superiority to placebo 
The MAH argued that the HOPE trial was a landmark study that has profoundly altered the pattern of 
medical  care  for  patients  at  high  risk  for  cardiovascular  events.  The  addition  of  ramipril  to  the 
therapies for patients at high risk became standard thereafter. Consequently the inclusion of a placebo 
arm in the ONTARGET trial would have been unethical since there already was an effective therapy 
available. 
Hence, the proof of superiority of telmisartan over placebo is based on 2 arguments by the MAH.  
The  first  argument  is  indirect  in  that  the  ONTARGET  trial  has  demonstrated  non-inferiority  of 
telmisartan  versus  ramipril  and  that  the  HOPE  trial  has  shown  superiority  of  ramipril  over  placebo. 
Both studies were performed in a similar population of patients at high risk for major cardiovascular 
events.  This  analysis  is  supported  by  the  observation  that  the  HOPE  risk  score  was  essentially  the 
same for the patients in the HOPE trial and the patients in the ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials 
(see  below).  The  HOPE  score  accounts  for  the  risk  factors  age,  sex,  smoking,  hypertension,  left 
ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, prior stroke, history of PAD and/or ankle/arm SBP <0.9, and history 
of CAD. A summary of the HOPE risk score in the 3 trials is provided in Table 1: 6, below.

Note that the HOPE source data are proprietary to PHRI and are not available to the applicant. Therefore, the calculation of 
the HOPE risk score in this table was performed by PHRI for all 3 studies. The applicant had used slightly different criteria 
for the calculation of the HOPE risk scores in 2 clinical trial reports of ONTARGET (U08-1821-01) and TRANSCEND 
(U08-1959-01).  
The ONTARGET trial has demonstrated risk ratios for telmisartan versus ramipril that were close to 
unity for both the 4-fold and the 3-fold endpoints. This observation allows the MAH to conclude that 
both medications have a comparable clinical efficacy in the prevention of major cardiovascular events. 
Assuming the clinical equivalence for telmisartan and ramipril, the results of the TRANSCEND trial 
can  be  used  to  estimate  the  potential  benefit  of  both  treatments  over  placebo  given  in  addition  to 
standard  care.  The  hazard  ratio  of  telmisartan  vs.  placebo  of  0.87  in  TRANSCEND,  indicates  a 
potential benefit of 13% over placebo in the 3-fold endpoint. This was substantiated with the analysis 
of  the  supportive  data  from  the  pooled  analysis  of  patients  who  did  not  use  ACE-Is  from  the 
TRANSCEND and the PRoFESS trials. Given the results of ONTARGET, it has to be assumed that 
the benefit of ramipril in the context of current medical practice would be very similar to that observed 
for  telmisartan,  i.e.  around  13%  over  placebo.  The  HOPE  study  (patient  enrolment  1993  to  1995) 
however had shown a treatment benefit of 22% of ramipril over placebo. The difference between both 
estimates (especially given the similarity in the HOPE risk score) is most likely due to improvements 
in medical care for patients at high risk for major cardiovascular events that have occurred during the 
about 8 years between the HOPE and the ONTARGET trials. 
The  second  MAH  argument  for  the  superiority  of  telmisartan  over  placebo  is  based  on  a  direct 
comparison  of  telmisartan  with  placebo  in  the  TRANSCEND  trial.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the 
TRANSCEND study was the 4-fold endpoint and superiority of telmisartan over placebo could not be 
demonstrated.  However,  for  the  3-fold  endpoint  which  was  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  HOPE  trial, 
telmisartan  was  superior  (the  hazard  ratio  for  telmisartan  vs.  placebo  was  0.87  (95%  CI  0.76,  1.00; 
p=0.0483). In view of the MAH, the lack of statistical superiority for the 4-fold endpoint appears to be 
linked  to  the  reduced  event  rate  of  the  primary  endpoint  observed  in  the  placebo  arm  of  the 
TRANSCEND  study  compared  with  the  HOPE  trial,  and  to  the  absence  of  an  effect  of  telmisartan 
treatment on the frequency of hospitalisations for congestive heart failure (CHF). 
The  study  protocols  of  both  ONTARGET  and  TRANSCEND  had  stipulated  that  patients  with 
"symptomatic  CHF"  were  to  be  excluded  from  participation  in  the  trials.  This  appears  to  have 
minimised  the  participation  of  patients  who  were  likely  to  develop  symptomatic  CHF  during  the 
5 years of study drug treatment. Given the administration of effective co-medication, the incidence of 
hospitalisation  because  of  CHF  in  TRANSCEND  was  too  low  to  detect  any  difference  between 
telmisartan and placebo treatment and this in turn has 'diluted' the significant effect of telmisartan on 
the other items of the primary endpoint, i.e. stroke, MI, and cardiovascular death. 
The sample size calculation of the TRANSCEND study was based on the results of the HOPE study. 
Assuming  event  rates  as  observed  in  the  HOPE  trial,  the  study  would  have  had  the  power  to 
demonstrate superiority of telmisartan over placebo provided that at least 6000 patients were entered. 
A retrospective comparison showed that the event rates in the placebo group of the HOPE trial were 
substantially higher than in the placebo group of the TRANSCEND trial. For the 4-fold endpoint, the 
event  rate  was  5.09  (per  100  PY)  in  the  HOPE  trial  whereas  it  was  only  3.87  in  TRANSCEND. 
Similarly for the 3-fold endpoint, the event rates were 4.53 versus 3.33, respectively.1 The differences 
in the composite endpoints between the placebo groups in the trials were largely due to substantially 
higher event rates for MI (HOPE 3.06 vs. TRANSCEND 1.09). This result might be a reflection of the 
improvement of medical care and general use of concomitant medications recommended in guidelines 
issued  by  European  and  US  cardiology  societies.  There  was  a  substantial  increase  in  concomitant 
treatment with effective medications such as statins, beta-blockers, and diuretics in the TRANSCEND 
1 The calculation of the event rates of the HOPE trial was performed by PHRI on their data base because this 
information is not available in the publication of the HOPE trial. The communication with PHRI is available in 
the Clinical Trial Master File of the ONTARGET study.

trial compared with the HOPE trial. Whereas in the HOPE trial, 28.6% of patients were taking lipid-
lowering  medications  (including  statins)  concomitantly,  the  percentage  was  twice  as  high  in  the 
TRANSCEND study (55.2% at baseline, increasing to 63.5% at study end), similar observations were 
made  for  beta-blockers  (HOPE:  39.8%  vs.  TRANSCEND  57.2%),  and  diuretics  (HOPE  15.2%  vs. 
TRANSCEND 38.2%).  
Thus,  since  the  study  populations  in  ONTARGET,  TRANSCEND  and  HOPE  were  similar,  the 
difference in cardiovascular event rates is most likely due to the more frequent use of co-medication in 
ONTARGET and TRANSCEND. The MAH outlined that, despite these changes in medical care, the 
TRANSCEND study has demonstrated superiority of telmisartan over placebo for the 3-fold endpoint. 
Data  of  the  ONTARGET  study  were  investigated  for  the  influence  of  statins  as  co-medications:  a 
lower  incidence  of  primary  events  was  observed  in  patients  who  took  statins.  This  was  seen  in  all 
treatment groups and therefore the statin use might have contributed to the improved risk reduction. 
However,  the  concomitant  use  of  statins  exerted  a  similar  influence  in  both  the  telmisartan  and  the 
ramipril groups. This was evidenced by the absence of a significant subgroup-by-treatment interaction 
p-value (p=0.5768).  
Absence of a clinically important difference compared to ramipril 
The  2  objectives  of  the  ONTARGET  trial  were  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  the  telmisartan  and 
ramipril combination therapy over ramipril and to establish non-inferiority of telmisartan to ramipril. 
A total of 25620 patients were randomised (T/R: n=8502; T: n=8542; R: n=8576) in the ONTARGET 
trial.  The  primary  outcome  occurred  in  16.3%  of  patients  in  the  telmisartan/ramipril  (T/R) 
combination  group,  16.7%  in  the  telmisartan  (T)  group,  and  16.5%  in  the  ramipril  (R)  group.  The 
hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  T/R  versus  R  was  0.99  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  0.92,  1.07;  p=0.8462). 
Thus,  the  trial  failed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  the  telmisartan/ramipril  combination  versus 
ramipril; however, this was considered not relevant for this application. The hazard ratio of telmisartan 
versus ramipril was 1.01 (97.5% CI 0.93, 1.10; one-sided p-value for non-inferiority: 0.0019). Since 
the upper limit of the 97.5% CI was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.13 and the p-
value for non-inferiority was below 0.0125, the trial succeeded in demonstrating the non-inferiority of 
telmisartan versus ramipril in the prevention of the composite 4-fold endpoint. The treatment effects 
persisted  after  correction  for  differences  in  SBP  at  baseline  and  over  time.  At  the  same  time,  non-
inferiority of telmisartan versus ramipril for the 3-fold endpoint of MI, stroke, and CV death could be 
demonstrated  (HR  0.99;  97.5%  CI  0.90,  1.08,  p-value  for  non-inferiority  0.0004).  Thus,  telmisartan 
was  as  effective  as  ramipril  in  the  background  of  increased  use  of  other  medications.  The  effect  of 
telmisartan was consistent across all subgroups.  
The  benefit  of  telmisartan  over  placebo  as  shown  in  the  analysis  of  the  3-fold  endpoint  in  the 
TRANSCEND study was 13% and was in the range of 8% to 18%, depending upon endpoint (3-fold 
vs. 4-fold, time period of evaluation, etc.). The benefit of ramipril over placebo in HOPE was about 
22%. The difference in effect size is almost certainly due to the substantially increased use of statins, 
beta  blockers,  diuretics,  and  general  improvement  in  the  medical  care  of  cardiac  patients  that  have 
occurred between the time the HOPE and current outcome studies were conducted.  
The arguments presented above also formed the basis of the MAH presentation held in the context of 
the oral explanation. 
In conclusion, following the assessment of all efficacy data provided, the CHMP was of the view that 
telmisartan  showed  a  similar  effect  to  ramipril  in  reducing  the  primary  composite  endpoint  of 
cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  or  hospitalization  for 
congestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) 
and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 
1.10,  p  (non-inferiority)  =  0.0019  at  a  margin  of  1.13).  The  all-cause  mortality  rate  was  11.6%  and 
11.8% among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients respectively  
Telmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of 
cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  and  non-fatal  stroke  [0.99  (97.5  %  CI  0.90  - 
1.08,  p  (non-inferiority)  =  0.0004)],  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  reference  study  HOPE  (The  Heart 
Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  
27 
With reference to TRANSCEND no statistically significant difference in the incidence of the primary 
composite  endpoint  (cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  or 
hospitalization  for  congestive  heart  failure)  was  found  (15.7%  in  the  telmisartan  and  17.0%  in  the 
placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)). There was evidence for a 
benefit  of  telmisartan  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pre-specified  secondary  composite  endpoint  of 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95% CI 0.76 - 1.00, 
p = 0.048)], There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 
0.85 - 1.24). 
Combining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV 
mortality and all-cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was 
a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  hyperkalaemia,  renal  failure,  hypotension  and  syncope  in  the 
combination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended 
in this population. 
1.9 Clinical Safety 
The  Tables  below  summarize  the  numbers  of  patients  included  in  the  safety  sets  relevant  for  the 
analysis and the time on treatment. 
28 
 
 
 
  
 
Overall,  the  established  safety  profile  of  telmisartan  was  confirmed  in  patients  at  high  risk  of  CV 
disease  if  not  used  in  combination  with  ramipril.  Overall  mortality,  the  frequencies  of  SAEs  on 
treatment, and the frequencies of adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were 
comparable  between  the  monotherapy  treatment  groups.  The  analysis  of  adverse  events  leading  to 
permanent  treatment  discontinuation  and  of  SAEs  showed  that  cough  and  angioedema  were  less 
frequently  reported  in  the  telmisartan  group  than  in  the  ramipril  group;  conversely  hypotension  was 
reported  more  frequently with  telmisartan.  In  TRANSCEND,  overall  mortality  and  the  frequency of 
SAEs while on treatment, were comparable between the telmisartan and the placebo groups. Adverse 
events  leading  to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  were  slightly  more  frequently  reported  with 
telmisartan than with placebo; these were almost all known adverse events associated with the use of 
telmisartan.  In  the  telmisartan  group,  hypotensive  and  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  renal  dysfunction, 
and  increases  in  creatinine  or  potassium  concentrations  led  more  frequently  to  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation than in the placebo group. The analysis of the safety data of the PRoFESS/NoACE-I 
population confirmed the findings in TRANSCEND.  
In  the  TRANSCEND  study  and  the  PRoFESS  study  patients  had  been  started  on  80  mg  telmisartan 
without  a  titration  regimen.  The  observed  safety  profiles  in  the  run-in  period  of  TRANSCEND  and 
during  the  first  4  weeks  in  the  PRoFESS  study  for  the  PRoFESS/NoACE-I  population  were  similar 
and consistent. The incidences of SAEs were low and the changes in serum creatinine and potassium 
levels  were  small.  These  data  in  many  thousands  of  patients  clearly  support  that  telmisartan  can  be 
started at a dose of 80 mg in patients at high risk for major cardiovascular events. 
Total deaths were numerically higher on telmisarten in the TRANSCEND study (364 vs. 349), but not 
in the ONTARGET study (989 vs. 1014). 
Overall the safety profile in the study is consistent with the known profile of telmisartan. However, a 
prevention strategy with a defined dose of 80 mg of telmisartan, regardless the blood pressure values, 
is of some concern with respect to a potential risk of hypotension. In fact, in the ONTARGET study a 
higher rate of hypotensive symptoms has been recorded in telmisartan group versus ramipril group. On 
the other hand, no specific studies have been performed using telmisartan with lower dosage for this 
new  indication.  Thus,  a  close  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  with  the  use  of  telmisartan  in  this 
indication is necessary.   
A concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril was associated with a numerically higher rate of deaths, 
CV deaths and treatment discontinuations due to AEs. This combination cannot be recommended in 
29 
 
 
the target patient group. However, findings from combination therapy are not considered to be relevant 
for this application. 
Pharmacovigilance 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  risk  management  plan  during  the  procedure.  The  RMP  has  been 
sufficiently updated; however, a further revision of the RMP reflecting the final agreed indication will 
be provided as a post-authorisation commitment. In line with the CHMP question on aggregate data, 
the MAH has agreed to submit annual PSURs and will include analyses by aggregate data for renal 
dysfunction  as  a  consequence  of  dual  RAAS  blockade,  sepsis,  hypoglycaemia,  increase  of  hepatic 
related adverse reactions in the Japanese population, and rhabdomyolysis.

2.  Conclusion on Benefit-Risk and SAG outcome 
Throughout  the  assessment  of  the  application  there  were  two  different  views  represented  within  the 
CHMP.  
View 1  
Overall, the clinical benefit of telmisartan, reported in the main trial on the two composite end-points, 
which  define  the  long-term  efficacy  in  CV  prevention,  is  comparable  to  ramipril  findings  and  thus, 
based on a well documented evidence.   
The basis of the non-inferiority margin is not questioned because:  
1. 
2. 
the comparator ramipril showed well established evidence for efficacy and safety in the HOPE 
reference trial;  
the  minimal  difference  in  non  inferiority  does  not  affect  the  clinical  relevance  in  both 
indication, hypertension and CV prevention; 
3.  Confidence Intervals of ONTARGET are well within the lower boundaries for efficacy. 
In  the  ONTARGET  study  the  degree  of  reduction  of  cardiovascular  risk  was  influenced  by 
improvement of standard of care, as the event rates reported by the HOPE trial are not longer seen in 
patients in primary prevention, at least in Europe.  
The MAH’s justification that the lower effect observed is based on the increasing use of concomitant 
medications like statins, beta-blockers in the more recent studies is agreed. Indeed, the results of the 
ramipril arm of the ONTARGET confirmed that the reduction of the overall cardioprotective effect of 
ramipril was related to a reduction in the overall risk.  
However,  the  new  indication  should  be  reworded  to  achieve  a  better  identification  of  the  target 
population.  
The  safety  overall  profile  of  telmisartan  in  the  CV  prevention  studies  is  consistent  with  the  known 
profile of telmisartan in the anti- hypertensive setting and does not raise any new safety concern. 
View 2  
There  are  major  concerns  that  preclude  a  straightforward  assessment  of  a  possible  effect  of 
telmisartan.  Overall  the  result  in  the  ONTARGET  study  looks  numerically  similar  to  that  of  the 
comparator ramipril.  
The  data  do  not  allow  to  conclude  that  the  effect  of  ramipril  is  preserved  (equivalence).  Even 
superiority  of  telmisartan  vs.  placebo  was  not  demonstrated  neither  when  compared  to  a  putative 
placebo in ONTARGET, nor when directly compared to placebo in TRANSCEND and PRoFESS. 
Therefore,  the  decision  about  an  approval  will  be  based  on  studies  indicating  a  numerical  similarity 
between  telmisartan  and  ramipril  in  some  clinically  relevant  endpoints  without  proof  of  therapeutic 
equivalence to ramipril or superiority over (putative) placebo. 
Nowadays the treatment effect of ramipril is much lower than can be expected from the HOPE study. 
The data suggest that an obtainable effect may be around 6 – 13% (TRANSCEND and PRoFESS). It 
may even be lower (ONTARGET), since the overall event rate in ONTARGET was about 10 – 20 % 
lower than in TRANSCEND and PRoFESS the two studies that were conducted in parallel. 
With  much  smaller  effect  sizes  the  clinical  relevance  of  an  effect  is  less  clear  than  in  the  past  for 
ramipril  in  the  HOPE  population.  This  is  especially  true  in  a  case  like  this,  where  two  large  scale 
placebo  controlled  trials  revealed  a  numerical  increase  in  all-cause  mortality  by  about  3  –  5%  with 
telmisartan. Nowadays there seems to be nothing left of the 16% decrease in mortality seen previously 
in the HOPE population with ramipril. 
Today  it  is  more  difficult  to  demonstrate  superiority  over  placebo,  therapeutic  equivalence  and  a 
clinically  relevant  effect.  Considering  that  the  placebo  corrected  effect  sizes  for  the  4-fold  (primary 
endpoint) or 3-fold composite endpoint may be around 6 – 13% it is clear that the predefined criteria 
for  conclusion  on  therapeutic  equivalence  (Non-inferiority  margin:  13%)  are  not  appropriate.  When 
31 
 
 
 
applying  this  margin  even  superiority  vs.  placebo  cannot  be  demonstrated.  Therefore,  post  hoc  pre-
specified statistical analysis is not appropriate to support any claim. 
Furthermore  post  hoc,  the  MAH  considered  the  3-fold  cardiovascular  endpoint  including  CV  death, 
Non-fatal  MI  and  Non-fatal  stroke  as  more  relevant  than  the  4-fold  endpoint  that  also  includes 
hospitalisation for congestive heart failure. This is not convincing for the following reasons: 
a)  The  4-fold  endpoint  was 
in 
the  pre-defined  primary  endpoint 
TRANSCEND.  The  choice  to  base  the  assessment  on  the  3-fold  endpoint  without  CHF  was  a 
post hoc decision in knowledge of the data. 
in  ONTARGET  and 
b)  The  likely  reason  for  this  approach  was  an  unfavourable  outcome  in  the  CHF  component.  In 
TRANSCEND the HR was 1.05, numerically in favour of placebo, and in the ONTARGET trial 
353 patients (4.1%) vs. 312 (3.6%) (telmisartan vs. ramipril) experienced this clinically relevant 
event. The MAH has not provided convincing arguments that this apparent advantage of ramipril 
over  telmisartan  in  this  clinically  relevant  aspect  was  due  imbalances  in  the  use  of 
dihydropyridienes  or  diuretics.  Since  hospitalization  for  CHF  is  clinically  relevant  and  the 
number of events was high enough there is no reason for a post hoc exclusion from the primary 
analysis. 
Consideration may be given, however, to the undisputed fact that today the effect achievable by this 
group  of  agents  in  general  is  much  lower  than  at  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the  HOPE  study.  If  a 
treatment  effect  of  about  6  –  13%  with  respect  to  cardiovascular  endpoints  and  without  a  positive 
effect  on  mortality  is  considered  clinically  relevant  and  placebo  controlled  studies  cannot  be 
conducted for ethical reasons, a non-inferiority study may not be feasible and the best result available 
may be a non-inferiority study revealing numerically similar effects. 
The CHMP decided during its July meeting to consult the Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory Group 
(CV-SAG). The below section presents the questions to the CV-SAG followed by the SAG discussion 
of the issues.  
Question 1 
Does the SAG consider that based on available data the treatment effect of ramipril in 
the ONTARGET study can be reliably estimated? 
Most experts believed that the effect of the ACE-inhibitors had remained stable over the past decade, 
other experts believed however that the beneficial effect of ramipril could have reduced over the time 
period from HOPE patient entry as a result of different usage of statins, antihypertensive etc. 
The  experts  in  methodology  of  clinical  trials  did  not  consider  that  the  available  data  allow  for  the 
reliable  estimation  of  the  actual  treatment  effect  of  ramipril  in  the  ONTARGET.  When  they  were 
asked  whether  it  is  possible  to  estimate  the  effect  of  ACE-inhibitors  on  the  prevention  of 
cardiovascular events they both answered that they were unable to quantify the actual effect. 
The Rapporteur team reminded the group that the 3-fold endpoint was identical to the one used in the 
HOPE  study  (CV  mortality  +  non  fatal  MI  +  non  fatal  stroke)  and  therefore  more  appropriate  for 
comparison. It argued that the endpoints used in ACE-I prevention trials and that, after ramipril, have 
also  led  to  the  MA  for  prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease  also  for  perindopril  do  not  include  HF 
(HOPE  –  EUROPA)  as  a  primary  composite  endpoints  (CV  mortality  +  non  fatal  MI  +  non  fatal 
stroke).  
Additionally it reminded that a similar application of indirect evidence has been adopted by CHMP for 
the MA of valsartan with submission of the VALIANT trial (HF after MI).  
The differences between current application and the HOPE results were presented. In HOPE there was 
a  numerical  reduction  in  all-cause  mortality  by  16%  for  ramipril.  A  non  inferiority  in  all-cause 
mortality  was  observed  in  the  ONTARGET  pivotal  study,  while  in  the  supportive  studies 
TRANSCEND and PRoFESS there was a numerical increase in all-cause mortality with telmisartan as 
compared to placebo by 3 – 5%. However, this point had already been discussed by the Rapporteur 
who  showed  that  this  numerical  increase  was  not  related  to  any  increase  in  cardiovascular  or 
malignancies.  In  addition  in  HOPE  there  was  a  reduction  in  heart  failure.  Non  inferiority  between 
telmisartan  and  ramipril  has  been  found  in  the  pivotal  ONTARGET  study  while  in  the  supportive 
32 
TRANSCEND  there  was  a  non  significant  numerical  increase  in  hospitalizations  for  heart  failure 
compared  to  placebo.  However,  it  was  underlined  that  this  latter  study  was  not  powered  to  detect 
changes in hospitalization for heart failure.  
The Co-rapporteur team noted that in the TRANSCEND study the result for telmisartan vs. placebo 
with, what it considered, an almost identical patient population (as compared to the patient population 
in ONTARGET) was negative for the four fold end point. However, most clinical experts agreed that 
patients intolerant to ACE-inhibitors cannot be compared to patients compliant to ACE-inhibition as 
shown  by  several  studies  assessing  the  effect  of  ACE-inhibitors  and  ARBs  in  heart  failure  (i.e. 
CHARM added, CHARM alternative, VALIANT). Furthermore, it was pointed out that valsartan was 
granted  indication  for  treatment  of  heart  failure  in  a  non  inferiority  study  similar  in  terms  of  design 
and results to the ramipril/telmisartan arms of ONTARGET. 
Following  the  extensive  discussion  it  was  concluded,  that  ramipril  has  an  effect  which  is  clinically 
relevant,  but  the  majority  of  experts  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  magnitude  of  the  putative  placebo 
treatment effect in ONTARGET cannot be reliably estimated. The majority of Group felt that it was 
impossible  to  quantifying  the  effect  of  ramipril  and  thereby  decide  where  to  put  the  non-inferiority 
margin. Some experts did not question the validity of 3-fold endpoint, neither the validity of the non-
inferiority  margin.  They  believed  that  the  minimal  difference  in  non-inferiority  does  not  affect  the 
clinical relevance in both indications: hypertension and CV disease prevention.   
Question 2 
Does the SAG consider the assay sensitivity of the ONTARGET study adequate either:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
to demonstrate indirect superiority vs. putative placebo or  
to demonstrate absence of a clinically important difference compared to ramipril 
Whether  the  non-inferiority  of  telmisartan  to  ramipril  was  demonstrated  in  the  ONTARGET  in 
patients  with  increased  CV  risk  with  respect  to  the  primary  4-fold  endpoint  and  secondary  3-fold 
endpoint raised a major discussion within the Group.  
As a consequence of the response to the first question it was felt that it is not possible to extrapolate 
from  the  ONTARGET  study  the  indirect  superiority  of  both  ramipril  and  telmisartan  vs.  putative 
placebo.  
The Co-rapporteur team emphasized that in view of the results from the TRANSCEND study it was 
impossible to quantify today the effect of ramipril as compared to placebo. 
The  bio-statistical  experts  felt  that  the  confidence  limits  of  non  inferiority  between  ramipril  and 
telmisartan  were  too  wide.  In  addition  experts  in  methodology  stated  that  not  adequate  assay 
sensitivity makes it more likely to receive the results close to zero.  
The  majority  of  the  experts  of  the  SAG  believed  that  there  are  no  clinically  important  differences 
between  ramipril  and  telmisartan  however  the  assay  sensitivity  of  the  ONTARGET  study  was  not 
adequate to demonstrate the absence of clinically important difference compared to ramipril.  
It  is  important  to  mention  that  some  experts  believed  that  the  non-inferiority  to  ramipril  in  the 
ONTARGET trial was demonstrated. They did not question the basis for the non-inferiority margin. 
They were of the opinion that the comparator ramipril showed a well established evidence for efficacy 
and  safety  in  the  HOPE  trial.  One  of  them  also  underlined  that  the  confidence  intervals  of 
ONTARGET were well within the lower boundaries for efficacy.   
Question 3 
What  is  the  relevance  of  the  threefold  as  compared  to  the  fourfold  combined 
cardiovascular  endpoints  in  the  ONTARGET,  TRANSCEND,  and  PRoFESS  study  in 
cardiovascular prevention in this application?  
For the Co-rapporteur team and experts in methodology of clinical trials this issue was of particular 
concern  because  primary  endpoint  in  TRANSCEND  failed  and  they  considered  that  in  this  case  the 
secondary endpoint cannot be analysed because it was not pre-specified in the statistical programme. 
For this reason the biostatisticians considered the 3-fold secondary endpoint, although indeed identical 
33 
to  the  primary  endpoint  in  HOPE  study,  not  adequate  for  confirmatory  conclusions  from  data  of 
TRANSCEND.  They  strongly  supported  the  Co-rapporteur’s  position  that  the  post  hoc  exclusion  of 
heart failure from the primary analysis in knowledge of the data is not appropriate irrespective of the 
claimed indication. In addition they mentioned that the results of the secondary endpoint can be valid 
only if the primary endpoint did not fail which was unfortunately neither the case in TRANSCEND 
nor in ONTARGET. 
The chairman underlined that the main secondary end point was a pre-specified end point and asked to 
circulate amongst the experts a copy of the main manuscript of the ONTARGET published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). In this publication it was well stated that the main secondary 
end  point  was  not  a  post-hoc  analysis  and  that  the  ONTARGET  showed  a  non  inferiority  of 
telmisartan  vs.  ramipril  on  the  main  4  fold  endpoint  and  on  the  main  secondary  (HOPE)  endpoint. 
Therefore,  he  believed,  that  the  comment  that  the  results  of  the  secondary  end  point  cannot  be 
evaluated had no scientific and methodological basis. The opinion was split and some experts strongly 
disagreed with this view.  
The SAG wondered why the company used in the first place 4-fold endpoint instead of the endpoint 
used earlier in HOPE which would make the direct comparison easier. This had been explained earlier 
during the discussion by the company that stated that the 4-fold endpoint was introduced following the 
suggestion from an expert and was a basis for the FDA application during the scientific advice they 
have asked to that agency.  
General  opinion  of  clinical  experts  present  in  the  room  was  that  both  endpoints  were  rather  similar. 
Some experts mentioned however that although the 3-fold composite endpoint is clinically relevant, it 
is not as relevant as the 4-fold endpoint.    
Question 4 
Does  the  SAG  consider  the  clinical  studies  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that  telmisartan 
improves all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality?  
From a clinical perspective, taking the totality of the data into account, the view of the SAG was that 
there is a treatment effect, although it cannot be reliably estimated in terms of effect size as compared 
to placebo. Therefore, in the opinion of the majority of the Group, the undertaken studies do not show 
that telmisartan improves either all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. It was noted however 
that mortality was only one of the variables of the combined end-point. 
One of the clinical experts was of the opinion that the benefits for patients were not clearly established 
because  the  benefit  is  to  be  expected  considerably  smaller  than  in  HOPE  and  the  signals  from  the 
supporting studies are more disturbing than assuring. However, on the other hand SAG admitted that 
the use of telmisartan does not seem to result in any increase of cardiovascular mortality.  
Therefore SAG member were of the opinion, given the above uncertainties, that telmisartan could be 
used for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients 55 years or older at high risk 
of cardiovascular disease in patients who are intolerant to ACE-inhibitors. 
Overall Benefit Risk Assessment 
Following  the  assessment  of  all  efficacy  and  safety  data  provided,  the  Committee  considered  that 
telmisartan  showed  a  similar  effect  to  ramipril  in  reducing  the  primary  composite  endpoint  of 
cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  or  hospitalization  for 
congestive heart failure in ONTARGET [incidence of the primary endpoint for telmisartan (16.7 %) 
and ramipril (16.5 %); the hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 1.10, p 
(non-inferiority)  =  0.0019  at  a  margin  of  1.13)].  The  all-cause  mortality  rate  was  11.6%  and  11.8% 
among  telmisartan  and  ramipril  treated  patients  respectively.  Telmisartan  was  found  to  be  similarly 
effective  to  ramipril  in  the  pre-specified  secondary  endpoint  of  cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal 
myocardial  infarction,  and  non-fatal  stroke  [0.99  (97.5  %  CI  0.90  -  1.08,  p  (non-inferiority)  = 
0.0004)],  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  reference  study  HOPE  (The  Heart  Outcomes  Prevention 
Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  
34 
Furthermore,  although  in  the  TRANSCEND  study  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the 
incidence  of  the  primary  composite  endpoint  (cardiovascular  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction, 
non-fatal  stroke,  or hospitalization  for congestive  heart  failure)  was  found  (15.7%  in  the  telmisartan 
and 17.0% in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)), there was 
evidence  for  a  benefit  of  telmisartan  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pre-specified  secondary  composite 
endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95% CI 
0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 
1.03, 95% CI 0.85 - 1.24). 
The degree of reduction of cardiovascular risk has been influenced by concomitant medications, as the 
event rate reported by the HOPE trial are not longer seen in patients in primary prevention, at least in 
Europe.  In  this  respect,  the  Committee  took  also  into  account  the  conclusions  of  the  CV-SAG  in 
particular regarding the constancy of the effect over time of the chosen comparator ramipril, i.e. that 
ramipril  has  an  effect  which  is  clinically  relevant,  but  that  the  magnitude  of  the  putative  placebo 
treatment effect in ONTARGET cannot be reliably estimated. The majority of the CV-SAG members 
felt that it was impossible to quantify the effect of ramipril and thereby decide where to put the non-
inferiority  margin  for  ONTARGET.  Consideration  was  given  to  the  fact  that  the  constancy  of  the 
effect  can  not  be  proven  by  the  submitted  data.  It  was  discussed  that  the  effect  achievable  by  this 
group  of  agents  in  general  might  be  lower  than  at  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the  HOPE  study.  The 
results  of  the  ramipril  arm  of  the  ONTARGET  confirmed  that  the  reduction  of  the  overall 
cardioprotective  effect  of  ramipril  was  related  to  a  reduction  in  the  overall  risk.  In  this  respect,  the 
Committee also took the overall available experience with ACE inhibitors and ARBs into account. 
The safety profile for the new patient population is consistent with the known profile of telmisartan. 
Cough  and  angioedema  were  less  frequently  reported  in  patients  treated  with  telmisartan  than  in 
patients  treated  with  ramipril,  whereas  hypotension  was  more  frequently  reported  with  telmisartan. 
There  was  significantly  less  discontinuation  of  telmisartan  than  both  ramipril  and  placebo  in 
ONTARGET and TRANSCEND, respectively.  
Thus,  following  the  overall  assessment  of  the  submitted  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  based  on  the 
outcome of the SAG meeting, the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk ratio of telmisartan is positive 
with regard to the following indication in SPC section 4.1: 
Cardiovascular Prevention

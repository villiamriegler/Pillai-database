Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC as a consequence of the data package submitted 
to support the new proposed solution for injection subcutaneous presentations. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0 and to introduce some editorial changes.  
The MAH applied for addition of a new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection), a new strength 
(200 mg) and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use). 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Benlysta 200 mg solution for injection (Syringes and 
syringes in prefilled pen):  
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti dsDNA and low 
complement) despite standard therapy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0183/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0183/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 July 2011. The Scientific Advice pertained to 
quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
This application is a line extension concerning the development of a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of 
belimumab for weekly fixed-dose administration. The recommended dosage of belimumab is 200 mg 
once weekly given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen or thigh.  
The proposed indication is add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g positive anti-dsDNA and low 
complement) despite standard therapy. The same indication as that already approved for IV use of 
belimumab.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with a broad spectrum of 
clinical presentations encompassing almost all organs and tissues. Women are affected 9 times more 
frequently than men. Sixty five percent of patients with SLE have disease onset between the ages of 
16 and 55 years. SLE is a chronic disease of variable severity with a waxing and waning course with 
significant morbidity that can be fatal in some patients. SLE is characterized by the presence of 
elevated levels of autoantibodies, which directly damage the body’s cells and tissues or form immune 
complexes which cause inflammation and tissue damage. 
About the product 
Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble human B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) 
thereby blocking the binding of soluble BLyS to its receptors on B cells. By binding BLyS, belimumab 
inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells 
into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.  
Marketing authorization for Benlysta in the European Union was first obtained on 13 July 2011.  
Benlysta is currently approved for the following indication: 
Add-on therapy in adult patients with active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
with a high degree of disease activity (e.g. positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard 
therapy 
The current authorised presentation is a dry powder for concentrate for solution for infusion with the 
dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 3 doses and 
then every 4 weeks thereafter. 
The proposed commercial formulation is a 200 mg/mL, ready-to-use solution for injection which 
supports a single 1 mL injection once weekly into either the thigh or the abdomen.  
The SC administration would allow greater flexibility for patients and may offer an alternative for those 
with poor venous access. To this end a new formulation of belimumab has been developed which 
enables SC administration utilizing either a single-use disposable prefilled pen (autoinjector) or a 
prefilled syringe with a needle guard. 
The MAH proposes to market both the SC and IV formulation concurrently. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a grouped submission containing: 
•  A line extension to register new pharmaceutical form, new route of administration and new 
strength/potency. 
The extension application is for a new solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously. The 
solution for injection will be presented in both a pre-filled syringe and a prefilled pen: 
-Benlysta 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
-Benlysta 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
•  A Type II variation, category C.1.4, to reflect the new data submitted for the line extension in the 
Product Information for the currently authorised presentations.

A centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, concerning Marketing Authorisation 
and application for a change to existing Market Authorisation leading to an extension as referred to in 
Annex I of regulations (EC) NO 1234/2008, or any national legislation, where applicable.  
Central scientific advice was issued by CHMP on 21 July 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/717/3/2011/III). 
CHMP agreed that the completed IV and SC toxicology studies (including completed SC local tolerance 
and SC immunogenicity studies) and the other non-clinical studies already conducted were adequate to 
support the Phase 3 SC study and filing of the Biologic License Application (BLA)/line extension.  
Agreement was reached on the proposed population PK analysis using a nonlinear mixed effect 
modeling approach based on a pooled PK dataset.  
CHMP also agreed that, in principle, positive results from a single Phase 3 pivotal study of similar 
design to the prior pivotal IV studies should be adequate to support the filing for the new formulation 
and route of administration, considering also that the company was targeting a similar overall 
exposure with the SC formulation as compared to the approved 10 mg/kg IV dose. A placebo 
controlled study was accepted. Other key design aspects of the pivotal Phase 3 study were discussed 
including eligibility criteria, sample size, background medication, primary and major secondary 
endpoints, statistical analysis approach, and proposed adverse events of special interest (AESI).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Benlysta (Belimumab) is a recombinant, human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that binds and antagonizes 
the biological activity of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) protein, a member of the tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily that promotes the survival of B lymphocytes. Belimumab was 
developed for the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The currently 
approved presentations are a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 120 mg/vial and 400 
mg/vial. 
With this extension application the applicant proposes a new pharmaceutical form, solution for 
injection, to be administered subcutaneously. Two presentations are applied for: 200 mg solution for 
injection in prefilled syringe with needle safety device and 200 mg solution in prefilled pen (auto-
injector). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Belimumab is produced in a NS0 cell line using a production medium. The purification process 
comprises a series of chromatographic steps, viral inactivation and filtration steps, and formulation. 
The purified bulk active substance (BDS) is filled in storage containers and shipped to the finished 
product manufacturing site. 
The M18 process is the BDS process for the clinical SC finished product, while the M21 process is the 
BDS process for the commercial SC product.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture and process controls 
The listed manufacturers and testing sites have been qualified to perform manufacturing, storage and 
control of active substance in compliance with GMP. 
 (step 19). The manufacturing process of these steps and process controls are at large acceptably 
described. The lifetimes of the filtration cassettes have however not yet been defined and reference is 
given to an ongoing validation study. However, interim effective lifetime for the commercial purification 
process is based on current data. Full results from this study will be provided upon completion of the 
study (Recommendation). Furthermore, in the meantime, in-process controls (IPCs) for integrity, 
water permeability as well as microbiological controls are in place.  
Reprocessing may be performed of the bulk filtration material in case of failure of the post-use filter 
integrity test or other mechanical failures. This has been validated in small-scale studies. Such 
reprocessing will be performed according to written procedures and a step-specific production batch 
record, and the first reprocessed lot will be monitored according to cGMP stability protocol. This 
approach is considered acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For the M21 process acceptable information has in general been provided. Together with the control of 
process parameters listed in section S.2.2 the control strategy is found acceptable. The control 
strategy is further discussed below.  
The IPC test methods have either been validated or qualified. The IPC test methods (have been 
described For each step, action and alert limits have been set for bioburden and endotoxin. These 
limits are based on historical data and process capability. will be established after a minimum of  
commercial scale runs and will be used to monitor process performance. 
Process validation 
For the M21 process, the Phenyl SFF pool is concentrated and diafiltrated into a new formulation buffer 
during the UF/DF step (Step 16). A Single Pass TFF step (Step 17) was introduced to the process 
following the UF/DF step for further concentration of the product. A summary of changes from the M15 
to M21 process has been provided. 
The process validation as well as process characterisation has been summarised. For the process 
characterisation of the steps a design of experiments (DoE) approach was used. No details from the 
DoE and process characterisation are provided, but it is claimed that all data is available for inspection. 
However, the process parameters defined as critical and key for the M21 process, including the 
operating ranges, are listed. Examples or summaries from the DoE and process characterisation had 
been useful for the support of the proposed control strategy. The proposed control strategy for the 
concerned steps which primarily only covers concentration and formulation, appears adequate. 
Furthermore, the summarised data provided from the validation studies (supporting studies for 
downstream process validation and conformance lots) are found supporting for the conclusion that 
adequate controls are in place. 
BDS batch release results for three conformance lots as well as the one supportive lot are provided. All 
batches comply with the acceptance criteria and demonstrate satisfactory consistency in batch results. 
The deviations occurred in relation to in-process results (feed pressure and flow rate which were 
claimed to be set too tight based on laboratory scale, two in-process bioburden results above action 
limit for chromatography step, endotoxin level above alert limit which was related to slightly elevated 
level in the WFI) have been acceptably described and justified. Relevant corrective and preventive

actions have been implemented. For all downstream data from analyses of the conformance lots 
reference is given to a validation report not provided. However, considering the summarised results 
provided from downstream validation and transport validation together with the batch results from the 
conformance batches, the data provided is in general found sufficient to verify satisfactory 
performance and consistency of the manufacture.  
However, as discussed above the lifetimes of the cassettes have not yet been defined with reference is 
to the ongoing validation study.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process development of the BDS SC manufacturing processes has been satisfactorily described. 
M21 is the proposed commercial process for liquid product intended for SC administration. Two 
formulations have been used during the development, and the proposed commercial formulation, is the 
same as that used in the Phase 3 clinical studies. M16 has been used in Phase I studies and M18 in 
Phase II and III. The main change between the M18 and M21 process is the addition of, after the step. 
The formulation is the same although the diafiltration buffer and polysorbate stock solution was 
modified. 
Three comparability assessments have been performed which by large is found acceptable. In the third 
study three BDS batches of M18 and three batches of M21 was compared. In these three studies side 
by side testing has been performed using relevant test attributes covering analytical release methods 
and additional characterisation studies such as oxidation, size variants and deamidation. By large the 
data is comparable for the M18 and M21 process except for slightly lower main peak and higher acidic 
peaks in the M21 process BDS lots. The root cause and acceptable correction actions were taken.  
Although the approach using the specification limits as acceptance criteria for the comparability studies 
cannot be fully supported considering the quite wide acceptance criteria, the batch data from the side-
by-side comparison at such is however found acceptable. The results demonstrate that the change in 
process from M18 used in phase 3 clinical trials to the M21 commercial BDS does not have any 
significant effect on the quality or analytical profile of BDS material.  
Characterisation 
Acceptable information about the characterisation of belimumab has been provided. For the complete 
data on characterisation of belimumab reference is given to the dossier for the currently licensed 
lyophilised IV products. To elucidate structures and properties of belimumab potentially affected by the 
liquid formulation and the effects of the different pH and excipients, a subset of the characterisation 
tests have been repeated. Acceptable information from these studies as well as from the comparability 
studies has been provided to verify that the primary structure and high order structure of belimumab 
liquid product in formulation 06-D are comparable and highly similar to the belimumab lyophilised 
product in formulation 06-B. 
It is agreed that no major differences in process-related impurities and product-related variants are 
expected between the product in liquid formulation and the product in lyophilisation formulation due to 
the similarity of the manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, some of the process related impurities 
such as small molecules (downstream process) and extractables/leachables have been adequately 
reassessed due to changes in process equipment and formulation.  
Charge variants have been previously characterized in belimumab BDS in lyophilised formulation 06-B 
and no new charge variants were detected in liquid product in formulation 06-D at release or upon 
recommended storage. This is also discussed in section S.2.6. where comprehensive data comparing 
batches from M16, M18 and M21 are provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 10/92 
 
 
 
 
 
Taken all information together the characterisation of the active substance is found sufficiently 
addressed. 
Specification 
Relevant tests are included in the specification for the active substance. The specifications for 
belimumab BDS were established and justified based on acceptance criteria and experience from the 
belimumab IV BDS process (M15) and from experience with the subcutaneous BDS processes (M18 
and M21). The acceptance criteria for pH, osmolality and protein concentration were changed due to 
the changed formulation. Nevertheless, in response to a question the applicant proposed to keep the 
shelf life limit for and slightly tighten the release limit. The shelf life was also decreased.  
For the calculation of the acceptance criteria for an approach using a worst case lot was used. Also the 
relationship between levels of in aged active substance batches (based on stability data) and finished 
product at release was evaluated.  
Although data is limited the available data indicate that the acceptance criteria for active substance will 
assure compliance with the finished product release criteria. 
Altogether with the limitation of data presented the applicant is recommended to put active substance 
batches with levels close to the release limit on stability studies to conclude about the stability trend at 
such higher levels. An action limit for what level of should trigger such a stability study should be 
defined. The proposed acceptance limits for on active substance can be accepted with this 
recommendation. 
For most analytical methods reference is given to compendial methods or The following methods have 
been slightly modified: appearance, identity, protein concentration, purity, charge heterogeneity, 
residual DNA, host cell protein. For the modified methods a summary of the differences are included in 
this section. Although a clear reference to the dossier for the IV product is given for the modified 
methods as well as good summaries of the differences, full descriptions relevant for the SC product 
were requested during the procedure. The dossier was updated as requested with the applicant’s 
responses. 
The applicant was asked to update the specification and test method with a unique identification 
number for each test method which assures a clear link between specification, test method and 
method validation. In their responses, such unique identification numbers were included in the 
specification, method descriptions and validation documents. 
Partial or full validation has been performed on the test methods except for the compendial methods 
where a qualification study was performed. The validation approach used as well as the validation 
results is found acceptable to justify the suitability for the intended purpose. 
Batch data has been provided for both non-clinical and clinical batches, as well as three batches of 
belimumab BDS manufactured by the commercial M21 process. By large the batch data demonstrate 
consistency although slightly higher values for total acidic peaks can be observed for the M21 process 
compared to M18 and M16, although still within the acceptance criteria. This has been further 
discussed above. The process change from M15 to M18/M21 is claimed not to impact the attribute for 
potency and thus the criteria applied to the M21 BDS is the same as that established for the approved 
IV product (M15 process).

Stability 
A shelf life of 48 months was initially proposed for M21 belimumab BDS at the intended storage 
condition of -40ºC protected from light. In the response to the Day 180 LoQ the applicant proposed to 
decrease the shelf life from 48 months to 36 months. 
Three batches belimumab BDS from the M18 and M21 manufacturing process respectively, in the 
commercial formulation buffer 06-D, have been included in the stability program. 
To justify the proposed shelf life and storage conditions, 36 months stability data (-40 ºC) has been 
provided for three batches manufactured according to the M21 process. In addition supportive data 
from three batches of the M18 process have been provided (60 or 48 months). The studies are on-
going. Also data from accelerated studies at -20°C and 2-8°C stability data are provided. The data 
indicates that the stability profile for the M18 and M21 process is comparable and the data from M18 
can be supportive. For all batches a slight increase can be observed at the proposed storage condition 
although still within acceptance criteria. At the accelerated condition at -20°C a significant increase 
could be observed and the results for purity were out of acceptance criteria after 6 months for both 
M18 and M21 process. However, it is noted that the acceptance criteria was with margin applied to 
when stored at 2-8°C. 
Based on the full time data for the M18 batches and the available 36 months for the M21 batches, the 
claimed shelf life of 36 months when stored at -40ºC protected from light, is found approvable.

injector-Before Use) 
Figure 4 - External Appearance of the Belimumab finished product in Safety Syringe (After 
Use) 
The finished product does not have an overage. It is manufactured with an excess volume to ensure a 
deliverable volume of 1.0 mL. 
The belimumab BDS concentrated formulated bulk solution is containing the same excipient 
components and excipient concentrations as the finished product. During the course of development of 
belimumab for subcutaneous administration, two formulations were used (). The proposed commercial 
formulation is the same as that used in the Phase 3 clinical study. The extensive formulation 
development has been satisfactorily addressed.  
Also an extensive manufacturing process development has been performed. Process characterisation 
studies were performed on each unit operation to conclude about risk and criticality of process 
parameters, and from this knowledge define proven acceptable ranges. The process characterisation 
studies performed on each unit operation has been summarised and the outcome adequately 
discussed. For example the filter membrane steps have been investigated with regards to pressure, 
multiple filtrations, filtration time, protein adsorption, flow rate. Refiltering of the bulk finished product 
can be performed in the. For justification of this re-processing reference is given to development 
studies as well as re-processing of two GMP clinical trial batches which were placed on stability studies. 
No impact on quality or stability was observed. Reprocessing in the context of is found acceptably 
justified.  
The risk assessment and control strategy development are found acceptably described although no 
details or examples from the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) were given. However, the 
critical quality attributes (CQA) have been defined and the relationship to the quality target product 
profile (QTPP) clearly indicated. A comprehensive summary table of critical process parameters (CPP) 
and IPC as well as justification relative to CQAs are provided. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical 
Assessment report

development studies and other data used in characterizing unit operations of the finished product 
manufacturing process have been satisfactorily summarised and discussed. The chosen control 
strategy is found adequate and acceptably justified. 
Also the development of the devices (auto-injector or safety syringe) and the assembly process 
including the control strategy has been adequately addressed. The defined CQAs and CPPs for the 
assembled auto-injector and the safety syringe are listed as well as the rationale for the classification.  
The auto-injector was not included in the Phase 3 study. Clinical bridging studies were performed 
which are further discussed in the Pharmacokinetic and the Clinical AR respectively. It is claimed that 
the primary difference between the clinical assembly machine and the commercial assembly machine is 
that the commercial assembly machine includes more extensive in-process controls and monitoring 
systems for the assembly steps. It is found acceptably justified that the two assembly processes 
produce equivalent devices. 
Furthermore, the suitability of the primary packaging has been assessed. The functionality of both the 
auto-injector and safety syringe has been studied. 
The development of the auto-injector and the selection of the related components for the safety 
syringe using human factors studies have been satisfactorily described. Details regarding these 
formative human factors studies leading to the device selection are provided in the human factors 
validation report (Section 3.2.R).These studies are assessed in the clinical assessment report. 
The strategy with respect to microbiological quality assurance of the finished product is adequately 
addressed and found acceptable. The product container closure system has been validated and stability 
studies include container closure integrity testing. 
Finally, this section includes information about studies used to assess the compatibility of the product 
in its container closure during various storage and in-use conditions. It has been demonstrated that 
the quality and stability of finished product is not impacted by stress associated with shipping and 
physical dropping of the device. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture of the finished product, primary and secondary packaging, quality control testing and 
batch release take place at Glaxo Operations UK Ltd, Harmire Road, Barnard Castle, County Durham, 
UK. 
Manufacture of finished product 
Reprocessing of may be performed This is found acceptably justified by the small-scale development 
study as well as results from reprocessing of two GMP clinical batches. 
The description of the manufacturing process and information of in-process controls for the 
manufacture of the final finished product is given in sufficient detail..  
Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters and in-process controls with justification relative to CQAs, and method of 
control for belimumab finished product manufacture were provided. Critical in-process controls were 
determined based on product and process understanding and utilization of risk management principles 
to ensure product quality. The manufacturing process is controlled throughout production using a 
combination of in-process performance tests, critical in-process control tests and defined operational 
ranges for process parameters.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 14/92 
 
 
 
 
With the additional information provided in the applicant’s responses the information about the CPP 
and IPC is considered sufficient. Relevant controls are in place to assure satisfactory process 
performance and finished product quality. The link to the defined CQAs was satisfactorily addressed in 
the section for manufacturing process development. The control strategy for the commercial finished 
product manufacturing process was developed by a combination of process characterisation studies, 
clinical manufacturing experience, process performance qualification (PPQ), and risk assessment. The 
process characterisation studies and manufacturing experience facilitated risk analysis and 
identification of critical process parameters during the risk assessment exercises. CQAs were identified 
for the product and FMEA was also performed for each process parameter. The chosen control strategy 
is found adequate and acceptably justified. 
Process validation 
A three-stage approach (stage 1: process design; stage-2: process qualification; stage-3: continued 
process verification) was used for the process validation. An adequate development work was 
performed in stage 1 where extensive process characterisation studies were performed on each unit 
operation to conclude about the impact on the CQAs. The data from the process performance 
qualification demonstrates a well-controlled process where all results complied well with acceptance 
criteria. Hold time has been satisfactorily addressed both from a stability and microbiological (media 
fills) point of view. Compatibility with the holding bag was acceptably demonstrated.  
Also acceptable compatibility of the sterile filter has been studied as well as microbial retention. The 
maximum time given for the sterile filtration and filling step is acceptably justified. Media fill validation 
of the line filling was performed. No contamination was observed.  
Finally, the device assembly has been appropriately validated by the process qualification process.  
Product specification 
Release and shelf-life specifications are in place for the unassembled pre-filled syringe. In addition the 
assembled devices have a separate set of specifications and acceptance criteria to ensure functionality 
of the devices. This approach is found acceptably justified by the development studies demonstrating 
that the assembly of the prefilled syringe into devices does not impact finished product quality of the 
prefilled syringe. 
The specification covers appropriate parameters which are in good agreement with the specification 
approved for the licensed lyophilised product where relevant.  
The strategy for setting the specifications is in line with ICH Q6B and takes into account data from 
batches used in clinical trials, manufacturing experience, analytical method performance and stability 
data. The applicant also claims that indication, dose and dosage frequency, PK/clearance, clinical 
efficacy and safety have been taken into account.  
The main principle for the establishment of acceptance criteria is considered acceptable. However, a 
statistical evaluation of the prefilled syringe release data was performed and the range calculated was 
presented. This is found acceptable from process and analytical capability point of view although some 
acceptance criteria of relevance for the safety and efficacy should be within the range of clinical 
experience.  
In their responses the applicant proposed to tighten the shelf life limit for aggregates to align with the 
IV product specifications and also agreed to tighten the finished product release limit. The relevance of 
the data from the IV administration as justification for accepting wider limits for purity by SEC-HPLC 
than are justified by the batch/stability and clinical data generated for the SC formulation were not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017

found conclusive. There is a known risk of hypersensitivity reactions with the IV product and the SC 
product is intended for unsupervised self-administration by patients at home (with no premedication). 
Thus, the setting of administration of the product is not comparable. In addition, literature articles cite 
that more frequent dosing e.g. a subcutaneous route of administration rather than an IV route might 
facilitate the ability of small amounts of aggregates to enhance immune response (Rosenberg 2006). 
Further, it is not within the scope of this assessment to extrapolate from data in the literature for other 
products such as trastuzumab (Hillenbach 2015). Therefore, it was considered that the shelf life limit 
for aggregates remained to be tightened in line with batch/stability data to a limit which can be 
justified as clinical safe based on clinical experience with the SC product. The release limits for finished 
product and active substance were also requested to be revised as appropriate. 
With their response, the applicant proposed to further tighten the shelf life limit for aggregates in 
finished product. For the calculation of the revised acceptance criteria for aggregates on finished 
product a worst case lot was used for the modelling. The approach used was found reasonable and has 
been agreed to. 
As part of the response, the applicant also provided clinical information on systemic and local site 
reactions observed during the SC trial. These reactions have previously been assessed in earlier rounds 
of this procedure. It is agreed that within the clinical study BEL112341, the incidences of 
hypersensitivity reactions and/or post-injection systemic reactions were low in both treatment groups, 
with lower or similar reported frequency in the belimumab 200 mg SC group as compared to placebo 
group. It is also agreed that all reported local injection site reactions were mild or moderate in 
severity. However, given also the identified risk of systemic hypersensitivity reactions with the IV 
product and the at-home setting of administration of the SC product, the acceptance of wider limits 
than justified by the batch/stability and clinical data generated for the SC formulation was not 
supported. The revised limits now more closely reflect the range of experience in the SC trial. This can 
be accepted. From a clinical perspective, this issue i.e. the reporting of systemic and local reactions by 
product will also be further followed in future PSUR submissions. 
In conclusion, the revised acceptance criteria for aggregate on finished product are found approvable. 
However, the limits are set wider than fully supported by batch and stability data. The limits are also 
wider than levels in batches of the SC product used in clinical trials and the applicant was at day 120 
asked to tighten the limits to mirror process consistency and further justify the conclusion about non-
significance of deamidated forms in batches at higher levels than used in clinical trials. 
In the applicant’s responses the limits for charge heterogeneity were slightly tightened based on a 
recalculation of previous available batch results from M18 and M21 process plus three 3 additional 
batches that were not available in the initial analysis. the proposed revised release are found 
acceptable to assure satisfactory consistency. 
Also the shelf life limits have been slightly tightened  
The applicant has provided an extensive discussion about the deamidation of belimumab and concludes 
that the results indicate that deamidation occurs rapidly upon injection with no apparent impact on 
clearance, safety or efficacy.  
This conclusion is found reasonable and the proposed revised shelf life limits for charge heterogeneity 
is found acceptably justified.  
Analytical methods 
For most test methods the same methods are used for both BDS and finished product. For compendial 
methods reference to Ph. Eur. is given. In addition summaries of the methods were provided for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017

appearance, sterility, bacterial endotoxins. Briefly summarised method descriptions have also been 
provided for the in-house methods for delivered volume, injection forces, delivered volume, auto-
injector needle guard lockout and safety syringe actuation and needle guard location. These are found 
acceptable. 
Since most test methods are the same for both BDS and finished product, the method validation and 
qualification reports cover both BDS and finished product and are addressed above for the BDS. For 
the test methods that are only used for finished product, summaries of validation and qualification 
studies have been provided. Also summaries of the validation studies of the additional device-specific 
tests are provided in this section. The information provided related to validation of the methods only 
used for the finished product is found satisfactory to verify the suitability and acceptable performance 
of the methods. The validation was performed according to ICH guidelines where relevant. For the test 
for delivered volume and injection force also compliance with the requirements by ISO-11608-1 (e.g. 
Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility) was verified.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system for belimumab 200 mg solution for injection is composed of a prefilled 
syringe (PFS) as the primary container closure which is assembled into a prefilled pen (auto-injector) 
or a safety syringe device. The syringes and stoppers meet Ph. Eur. requirements for Type I glass. The 
needle shield insert is a proprietary formulation qualified to meet ISO 10993-1 (Biological Evaluation of 
Medical Devices). 
An overview of the design and operation of the prefilled pen (auto-injector) and safety syringe device 
has been provided. A technical file on the auto-injector is provided in 3.2.R. The devices comply with 
the relevant requirements set forth by ISO 11608-1 and ISO 11608-5. 
Stability 
A shelf life of 36 months at the intended storage condition of 2-8°C, protected from light, is proposed. 
Until now 24 months long-term stability data have been presented for the three first manufactured DP 
batches manufactured from BDS from the M21 manufacturing process. The study is on-going up to 60 
months. To support the proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C, protected from light, 
full long time data has been provided for five batches manufactured from BDS from the M18 
manufacturing process, as well as supportive data from four additional batches manufactured from 
BDS M18. Considering that BDS derived from the M18 and M21 processes has been shown to be 
equivalent, as discussed above, the approach to base the justification of the shelf life on the “M18” 
batches is found acceptable.  
In addition 6 months accelerated data are provided for all batches after storage at 25°C/60%RH and 
40°C/75%RH (stressed). Also the impact of light exposure was studied. 
The tests and acceptance criteria are a subset of the test included in section 3.2.P.5 although the 
major parts of the tests are included. The chosen quality attributes has been acceptably justified.  
The data up to now demonstrates compliance with the acceptance criteria applied for batches stored at 
2-8ºC and indicate similar stability behavior as for M18.  
In conclusion, a comprehensive stability program has been presented and the results have been 
summarised and discussed in a sufficient way. The presented data supports the proposed shelf life of 
36 months when stored at 2-8°C.

Adventitious agents 
With regard to adventitious agents safety evaluation reference is given to the dossier for the licenced 
belimumab IV product (lyophilised product). This is found acceptable. 
 For these component contact materials, suppliers have provided assurances that, where used, any 
tallow-derived raw materials used in the manufacture of these components fulfil the requirements of 
the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy 
Agents via Medicinal Products EMA/410/01. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Benlysta dossier is of good quality and no major objections were identified in the documentation 
submitted. The issues raised during the review have been acceptably addressed.  
Active substance 
The M18 process is the BDS process for the clinical SC finished product, while the M21 process is the 
BDS process for the commercial SC product. The manufacturing process and IPCs for the steps which 
are unique for the current BDS M21 process for subcutaneous use have been adequately described.  
For the steps specific for the M21 process acceptable information about control of critical steps has 
been provided and the general control strategy presented is found acceptable.  
The process development of the BDS manufacturing processes has been satisfactorily described. M21 
is the proposed commercial process for liquid product intended for SC administration. Two formulations 
have been used during the development and the proposed commercial formulation is the same as that 
used in the Phase 3 clinical studies. 
Process validation and evaluation data is found sufficient to support a consistent performance of the 
manufacturing process.  
Relevant tests are included in the specification for the belimumab BDS. The specification was 
established and justified based on acceptance criteria and experience from the belimumab IV BDS 
process (M15) and from experience with the subcutaneous BDS processes (M18 and M21).The 
justification of the specification for the BDS is found acceptable. The stability data provided supports 
the proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored at -40ºC protected from light.  
Finished product 
The description of the manufacturing process and information of in-process controls for the 
manufacture of the final finished product is given in sufficient detail.  
Relevant tests are included in the specification of finished product (separate specification for 
unassembled prefilled syringe and device functionality). The strategy for setting the specifications was 
in general agreed to with the exceptions for the limits proposed for purity by SEC-HPLC.. The revised 
limits more closely reflect the range of experience in the SC trial and are found acceptable. 
Furthermore, during the procedure the applicant was also asked to tighten the limits for charge 
heterogeneity In the response the limits were slightly tightened based on a recalculation of data. In 
respect to this the applicant concluded that administration of finished product with variation in acidic 
content up to will have a negligible impact. This conclusion is found reasonable and the proposed shelf 
life limits for charge heterogeneity is found acceptably justified.  
The data reported from the batch analysis demonstrates acceptable consistency in production.

A shelf life of 36 months at the intended storage condition of 2-8°C, protected from light, is proposed. 
Until now 24 months long-term stability data have been presented for the three first finished product 
batches manufactured from BDS from the M21 manufacturing process. To support the proposed shelf 
life, full long time data has been provided for five finished product batches manufactured from BDS 
from the M18 manufacturing process, as well as supportive data from four additional batches 
manufactured from BDS M18. Considering that BDS derived from the M18 and M21 processes has been 
shown to be equivalent the approach to base the justification of the shelf life on the “M18” batches is 
found acceptable. The proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C is acceptably justified by 
data.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of the product applied for by this line extension is considered to be acceptable when used 
in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant 
to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a 
satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This is a line extension of Benlysta to propose a new commercial formulation 200mg/ml which enables 
sc administration, ready-to-use solution for injection which supports a single 1 mL injection once 
weekly into either the thigh or the abdomen. This proposed fixed 200 mg SC dose targets a similar 
belimumab exposure in terms of average steady-state AUC as the monthly 10 mg/kg IV dosing 
approved in SLE patients.  
Since the initial IV application 3 additional primary pharmacology studies have been conducted to 
investigate potential binding of belimumab to TNF family members and Fc-mediated functions of 
belimumab. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies, safety pharmacology studies and pharmacodynamics drug 
interaction studies were not performed related to the present line extension application. 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, additional studies were conducted in mice to investigate the 
pharmacokinetic comparability between a reference belimumab liquid formulation and an aged 
belimumab liquid sample as well as to determine the pharmacokinetics of a deamidated belimumab 
isolate and to evaluate the toxicokinetics in monkeys following subcutaneous administration.  
An in vitro study has also been performed to investigate the metabolic fate of belimumab. 
Neither in the initial IV application nor in the present distribution or excretion studies were performed. 
Non-clinical in vivo studies weren’t performed to investigate potential pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions with drugs that are likely to be co-administered with belimumab in the clinic.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 19/92 
 
 
 
 
Regarding toxicology, since the approval of the IV application only an 8-week local tolerance study was 
conducted to evaluate the potential for irritancy of belimumab, when administered 3 times via 
subcutaneous injection to cynomolgus monkeys over 29 days (3 total doses) and to assess the 
reversibility of persistence of any effects after an additional 4 weeks. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Since the initial IV application 3 additional primary pharmacology studies have been conducted to 
investigate potential binding of belimumab to TNF family members and Fc-mediated functions of 
belimumab.  
The results demonstrated that belimumab has affinity to BLyS, but not to the other related TNF 
members investigated (APRIL, TNFα, TNF-β, LIGHT, FasL or TL1-A). Competition experiments showed 
that BLyS binding to immobilized belimumab was inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations 
of belimumab. In these competition experiments IC50 values of 0.9 and 1.3 nM on the high and low 
density surfaces was obtained respectively, which is 3-4 fold higher than the previously reported 
affinity of belimumab for BLyS which is about 0.3 nM. The Applicant states that the higher IC50 values 
obtained in the competition experiments may be due to differences in reagent lot 
concentrations/potency. 
Analyses of BIAcore sensorgrams demonstrated that the Fc region of belimumab (human monoclonal 
anti-BLys IgG1) binds to FcRn with a Kd comparable to raxibacumab (human monoclonal anti-
protective antigen IgG1) and rituximab (human monoclonal anti-CD20 IgG1). Viability was similar 
between human IgG1, rituximab and belimumab treated BLyS expressing monocytic U937 cells. This is 
consistent with the lack of CD20 expression on the surface of U937 cells and therefore lack of 
rituximab-mediated ADCC.  
In B lymphocytic ST486 cells expressing CD20, rituximab induced killing was inhibited in the presence 
of an anti-idiotypic antibody to rituximab. Belimumab, both in the presence and absence of BLyS did 
not affect the viability of the cells compared to the isotype control. This result is consistent with the 
mechanism of action of belimumab not resulting in ADCC of B cells. 
Compared to the untreated controls and to the matched human IgG1 control, no reduction in viability 
was observed in BLyS-expressing U937 cells in the presence of belimumab and 10% human serum. In 
contrast, CD20 expressing ST486 cells were efficiently killed (> 99%) in the presence of rituximab 
(anti-CD20) and 10% human serum. The viability of ST486 was similar to untreated controls or human 
IgG1 isotype control when heat-inactivated serum (in which the complements are inactivated) was 
used with rituximab. This result is consistent with the mechanism of action of belimumab not resulting 
in CDC mediated killing of BLyS-expressing cells. 
An equilibrium binding method was used to determine equilibrium constants (Kd) of belimumab and 
various control antibodies to human FcγRIIIa. The measured Kd values for belimumab, rituximab and 
IgG κ were 1.79, 2.09 and 2.68 μM, respectively. IgG4 binding was too low to get an accurate 
measurement. These values are consistent with the ~1 μM Kd value previously reported for monomeric 
human immunoglobulins. The results obtained in the CDC and ADCC assays with primary human 
CD14+ monocytes confirm that belimumab does not mediate these effector functions while another 
anti-BLyS antibody, 9B6, known to bind to cell surface BLyS was able to mediate both CDC and ADCC 
activity, although the 9B6 mediated CDC activity was less pronounced compared to the activity 
observed with rituximab on the CD20-expressing cell line. The concentration of belimumab (66 nM) 
used for analysis of CDC and ADCC effector functions were 200 times the Kd, therefore all BLyS would

EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 20/92 
 
 
 
 
be predicted to be complexed with belimumab which would generate a maximum Fc-mediated effector 
response. 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies, safety pharmacology studies or pharmacodynamics drug 
interaction studies were performed related to the present subcutaneous injection application. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Since the initial IV application, additional pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in mice to 
investigate the pharmacokinetic comparability between a reference belimumab liquid formulation and 
an aged belimumab liquid sample as well as to determine the pharmacokinetics of a deamidated 
belimumab isolate (varying deamidation levels) and to evaluate the toxicokinetics in monkeys following 
subcutaneous administration.  
An in vitro study has also been performed to investigate the metabolic fate of belimumab. 
Serum belimumab concentrations in mice and monkeys were determined by an 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based ELISA assay.  A quantitative measure of the ECL signal emitted 
by each well was recorded, and the ECL counts emitted by the standard calibrators were used to 
generate a standard curve using a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) fit. The concentrations of belimumab in 
the serum samples were calculated from the standard curve. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 
the assay was 100 ng/mL of belimumab in 100% mouse serum. The same assay was used for the 
serum concentration determination of deamidated belimumab. Dosing solutions of the reference 
belimumab liquid formulation, aged belimumab liquid sample and deamidated belimumab were 
analysed using the same assay. 
Immunogenicity of belimumab was evaluated using an ECL-based ELISA assay. The plate was read for 
ECL counts. The ratio of the sample and negative control ECL signals was compared with the cut point 
established using 12 BALB/c mouse serum samples (1.150). Samples that give a ratio above the 
screening cut point were considered potential positive.  
Due to the sample volume limitation the confirmatory assay was not performed and the screening 
positive samples were considered confirmed positive. The bioanalytical methods are considered 
adequate. 
Either distribution or excretion studies were not performed in the initial IV application nor in the 
present. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No single dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity, interspecies comparison, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity or other toxicity studies were conducted in relation to the 
present SC administration application. 
Since approval of the IV application, an 8-week local tolerance study was conducted under GLP-
compliance to evaluate the potential for irritancy of belimumab, when administered 3 times via 
subcutaneous injection to cynomolgus monkeys over 29 days (3 total doses) and to assess the 
reversibility of persistence of any effects after an additional 4 weeks. 
All monkeys that were given belimumab by SC administrations at the 1000 mg/dose demonstrated 
systemic exposure. Following SC administration of 3 doses on days 1, 15 and 29 the Cmax increased 
by 59% and the through serum concentration increased about 2-fold. This was expected due to the 
long t1/2 in the cynomolgus monkey.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment for guselkumab is required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamic in vitro studies conducted demonstrated that belimumab binds to and 
antagonizes the biological activity of human soluble BLyS. The Applicant states that the higher IC50 
values obtained in the competition experiments may be due to differences in reagent lot 
concentrations/potency, which is agreed. 
The data provided in the new study reports show that the Fc portion of belimumab has affinity to both 
FcRn and FcγRIIIa. However, based on the results obtained the in vitro pharmacology studies there is 
no indication that belimumab mediates ADCC or CDC.  
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies, safety pharmacology studies or pharmacodynamics drug 
interaction studies were performed related to the present subcutaneous injection application, which is 
acceptable. 
Following a single 10 mg/kg SC dose of reference belimumab liquid formulation or aged belimumab 
liquid sample, PK of belimumab were similar and the 95% confidence interval for all PK parameters 
were overlapping between the two groups. For the deamidated belimumab the Tmax and Cmax values 
were similar to the reference belimumab liquid formulation and the aged liquid sample. As serum levels 
of deamidated belimumab decreased to below the LLOQ (100 ng/ml) on day 10 a comparison of other 
PK parameters were not possible to perform.  
The MAH states that the decreased serum concentrations in the animals dosed with the deamidated 
belimumab correlates to a higher incidence of ADA which either increase the clearance rate of the 
resulting belimumab-ADA complex or mask domains critical for binding to BlyS (neutralizing 
antibodies) which makes belimumab undetectable in the PK assay. This is agreed. It is noted that only 
female mice were used in the PK study.  
The results provided by the Applicant indicate that BlyS does not affect CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or 
CYP3A4 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent and reproducible manner in contrast to the 
prototypic CYP suppressors IL-6 and TNFα.  
No distribution or excretion studies were performed in the initial IV application or in the present, which 
is acceptable. 
The local tolerance study in cynomolgus monkeys did not provide any indication of belimumab-related 
effects in mortality, clinical observations, body weights, dermal irritation evaluations, clinical pathology 
and skin punch biopsy of the dose site of administration. The only effect observed was a reduction in B 
cells which most likely is related to the pharmacology of belimumab. Thus, belimumab administered by 
repeated SC injections to cynomolgus monkeys exceeding the intended human clinical SC dose 9- to 
14–fold on a mg/kg basis appears to be well tolerated. It is noted that only male cynomolgus monkeys 
were used in the local tolerance study.

From a non-clinical point of view the results of the additional nonclinical studies do not alter the 
original conclusions regarding the nonclinical efficacy and safety of belimumab for IV use in patients 
with SLE and in addition support the SC use of belimumab under the proposed clinical dosing regimen. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that from a non-clinical point of view this line extension for Benlysta is 
approvable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Phase 1-3 clinical development program for belimumab SC in SLE is comprised of 7 studies, 5 of 
which utilize the current to-be-marketed formulation (06-D), and the proposed SC dose of 200 mg. 
The Phase 3 trial BEL112341 is pivotal for the belimumab SC formulation, supported by the belimumab 
IV studies (C1056 and C1057) that formed the basis of the evidence for the initial approval of IV 
belimumab. 
The final commercial device formats (autoinjector and safety syringe) were not included in the pivotal 
Phase 3 trial. As part of the device bridging program for the autoinjector, a real-life use study of the 
autoinjector device was conducted; study 200339 was an 8-week single arm study with the objective 
to provide supportive data for the autoinjector for self-administration of belimumab and to further 
characterize the change in belimumab trough concentrations when switching from the IV to the SC 
administration. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic evaluation mainly aims at characterizing the pharmacokinetic profile after SC 
administration in order to support the proposed posology.

Pharmacokinetic data for SC administration of belimumab have been obtained from four Phase 1 
studies in healthy volunteers and from two Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studies in SLE patients. In the 
belimumab SC development program, 2 liquid formulations and dosage strengths of belimumab in 3 
different presentations have been used in clinical trials. Formulation 06-D is the final formulation 
intended for marketing. 
Analytical methods 
Concentrations of belimumab in human serum samples from all SC clinical studies were determined 
using validated bioanalytical immunoassay methods with an LLQ of 100 ng/mL of belimumab in human 
serum.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental methods were used to evaluate rich data in the individual single-dose 
studies. Evaluation of data from multiple-dose groups was performed by compartmental methods using 
Phoenix WinNonlin software. Sparse data from studies BEL112341, C1105 and BEL116119 were 
analysed using non-linear mixed effect modelling approach. A total of 688 subjects across 3 studies 
receiving belimumab administered SC and IV were included in the population PK analysis. The subject 
population comprised 584 females and 104 males with ages ranging from 18 to 77 years and weights 
ranging from 34 to 138 kg (median weight, 67.0 kg). There were white (61%), Asian (20%), Alaska 
Native or American Indian (6%) and African American (11%) subjects; 26% were of Hispanic/Latino 
ethnicity in the dataset. 
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of SC administered belimumab was evaluated in three studies in healthy 
volunteers. 
In Study C1105 the absolute bioavailability of belimumab following a single SC administration (final 
formulation 06 D) in healthy US subjects ranged from a mean of 74% to 82%. The absolute 
bioavailability in the study BEL116119 in Japanese subjects (formulation 06-D, prefilled syringe) was 
78%. In the study C1058 the absolute bioavailability of the early formulation 06-C was 67%. 
Study BEL117100 was a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, single-dose study of belimumab in 
healthy subjects. The study was designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a single dose of 
belimumab (200 mg) when self-administered SC (formulation 06-D) by healthy subjects using an 
autoinjector compared to a pre-filled syringe. The two injection devices, prefilled syringe and 
autoinjector, were bioequivalent. For both AUC and Cmax the ratios of the GLS means were close to 
unity and the 90% CI of the ratios within the conventional bioequivalence limits of 80-125%. 
Injections into the thigh resulted in slightly higher serum concentrations compared to injections into 
the abdomen regardless of device in BEL117100 (17% for prefilled syringe and 8% for autoinjector in 
terms of AUC and 11% and 13% for Cmax). The effect of different injection sites, thigh and abdomen, 
on belimumab PK was also evaluated in Study C1105. For both AUC and Cmax the 95% CI were 
overlapping indicating no significant difference between injection in thigh or abdomen.  
After switching from IV dosing of 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks to SC administration of the proposed dose 
of 200 mg once weekly a new steady state was in general reached after about 2-4 weeks (study 
200339). In this study patients could switch after an interval of 1-4 weeks after the last IV dose. For 
subjects who switched to SC dosing <1.5 week after the last IV dose the serum concentrations were 
approx. 50% higher at week 1 of SC dosing compared to week 8, i.e. there was a transient increase in

serum concentration after initiation of SC dosing. For patients who used a drug free interval of 2-4 
weeks the concentrations at week 1 and week 8 were comparable. 
Simulations 
Based on simulations with population PK data, steady state Cavg after SC administration of 200 mg 
once weekly was comparable to IV administration of 10 mg/kg every four weeks. Steady state 
concentrations were reached after approximately 11 weeks after SC dosing (Figure 5).

Time (weeks)
The impact of shifting the day of dosing on the belimumab concentrations was evaluated using 
simulations using the SC population PK model. Administration of an additional dose one day after the 
scheduled dose followed by weekly administration relative to the new dosing day resulted in a transient 
increase in Cmax of approximately 20%. 
The impact of missing a dose and then taking the missed dose one day before the next scheduled dose 
resulted in a transient decrease in Cmin by approximately 20%. After administration of the next 
scheduled dose (i.e. one day after the “make-up” dose), there was a small temporary increase in Cmax 
by 3%. 
The impact of switching from IV to SC administration was also simulated. In accordance with the 
results from study 200339, there was a transient increase in serum concentration when a switching 
interval of 1 week was used. When a longer interval of 3-4 weeks was simulated, SC Cmin levels were 
above IV SC levels. However, steady state levels appears not be attained until approx. four weeks 
after the switch.

Distribution 
Based on the population PK analysis the volume of distribution of belimumab at steady-state (Vss) is 
4.95 L. 
Elimination 
The systemic clearance estimated from the belimumab SC population PK analysis was 204 mL/day. The 
terminal t1/2 estimated from the population PK analysis was 18.3 days which was similar to that 
estimated in the IV population PK analysis (19.4 days). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality data is very limited but there are no strong indications of deviations from dose 
proportionality. No further investigation is required since only one dose level of 200 mg is 
recommended. 
There are no indications that the duration of dosing has no substantial effect on PK of belimumab SC. 
Special populations 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability was moderate; 25-44% for AUC and 25-33% for Cmax in healthy 
volunteers. Intra-individual variability was not evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the Phase 3 study BEL112341 steady state concentrations of belimumab were reached by 
approximately week 16 or earlier.  The median concentrations at steady state after SC administration 
of 200 mg weekly (105 µg/mL) was close to steady state Cav after administration of 10 mg/kg every 4 
weeks in the IV program (110 µg/mL). 
No specific studies have been performed with respect to special populations. All available information is 
obtained from the population PK analysis.  
In the population PK analysis there was a trend towards decreased clearance with decreased creatinine 
clearance, but the impact was not statistically significant. No dosage adjustments are considered 
necessary in patients with impaired renal function. Caution is however recommended in patients with 
severe renal impairment due to lack of data. Patients with hepatic impairment are considered unlikely 
to require dosage adjustments.  
Gender or race did not have a statistically significant impact on belimumab SC PK in the population PK 
analysis. 
The flat SC dosing leads to decreased exposure in patients with high weight and increased exposure in 
low weight patients. The decreased exposure in subjects with higher body weight or BMI did however 
not result in decreased efficacy.  
There is very limited pharmacokinetic data in patients over 65 years of age.  
There is no data in children or adolescents since Benlysta is not indicated in the paediatric population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 27/92 
 
 
 
 
Belimumab SC exposure was not significantly affected by anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in the population 
PK analysis. Given the small number of subjects with ADAs, an effect on ADAs on belimumab PK can 
however not be completely excluded. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vivo interaction studies have been conducted. 
An in vitro evaluation of the effect of BLyS on mRNA levels of CYP450 enzymes has been conducted. 
Although no effect was seen, no firm conclusion can be drawn since cytokine mediated drug-drug 
interactions cannot currently be predicted using in vitro data. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The population PK and PK/PD analysis was based on PK data from 3 studies: C1105, BEL112341 and 
BEL116119 and PD data from the pivotal study BEL112341. 
Mechanism of action 
Belimumab is a recombinant human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that binds and antagonizes the 
biological activity of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, also known as BAFF) protein, a member of 
the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily that promotes the survival of B lymphocytes. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
High serum levels of soluble human B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) have been shown to be associated 
with SLE disease activity [Petri, 2008b] and to increase the risk of clinically meaningful flare over the 
following year [Petri, 2013]. Given this association, targeting the BLyS pathway appears to be a 
mechanism for the treatment of SLE. Pharmacodynamic responses to belimumab are consistent with 
this mechanism of neutralizing BLyS. 
In study BEL112341, belimumab SC significantly reduced circulating CD19+, CD20+, transitional and 
naïve B cells, the SLE B cell subset, and plasma cells at Week 52. Reductions in transitional and naïve 
B cells and the SLE B cell subset were observed as early as Week 8 and were sustained to Week 52.  
A significant mean percent reduction from baseline in IgG was observed by Week 8 in the belimumab 
200 mg SC group compared with placebo and was maintained throughout the treatment period, with 
an adjusted mean percent increase of 0.9% for placebo and 9.5% reduction for belimumab at Week 
52. Reductions in IgA and IgM levels were also observed starting at Week 8 for IgA and Week 16 for 
IgM. These were maintained throughout the treatment period with a mean adjusted percent reduction 
of 11.7% in IgA and 32.4% in IgM at Week 52 in belimumab-treated subjects. 
Immunoglobin and B cell response in study BEL112341 are compared to the pivotal IV study C1056 in 
the table below (study C1057 did not assess B cell subsets), illustrating that immunoglobin and B cell 
changes were consistent between the SC and IV studies.

No new studies on secondary pharmacology were conducted for the belimumab SC formulation 
development program. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics has been well characterised in both healthy volunteers and in SLE patients. 
Belimumab concentrations in serum were evaluated using validated bioanalytical methods.  
Two devices are proposed for marketing; a prefilled syringe (PFS) and an autoinjector (AI). The PFS 
was used in the pivotal Phase 3 study. The AI was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the PFS in a 
well-designed relative bioavailability study. 
For patients switching from IV to SC dosing, an interval of 1-4 weeks is proposed in the SmPC. In 
study 200339 subjects who switched to SC dosing <1.5 week after the last IV dose the serum 
concentrations were approx. 50% higher at week 1 compared to week 8, i.e. there was a transient 
increase in serum concentration after initiation of SC dosing, indicating that a switching interval of 
<1.5 weeks may be somewhat short. Similar results were obtained in the simulations. It is however 
not anticipated that a 1-4 week switching interval would have a negative safety impact.  
Based on the simulations of shifting in administration day the transient increase in Cmax is unlikely to 
be of clinical relevance. The increase in Cmax was modest (<20%) and maximum concentrations still 
lower than after IV administration. The simulation may be considered a worst-case scenario to 
evaluate the maximum increase in serum concentrations after a shift in dosing schedule. The 
simulations support the SmPC wording that a new dose can be given on the newly preferred day of the 
week and that the patient should continue with the new weekly schedule from that day.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 29/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the simulated data, the impact of a missed dose appears to be minor. In case a dose is 
missed and not administered until one day prior to the next scheduled dose, Cmin levels were 
temporarily decreased, but were still higher than expected Cmin after IV dosing, and unlikely to have 
any clinical relevance. The simulations support the SmPC wording that, if a dose is missed, it should be 
administered as soon as possible but that it is not necessary to administer two doses on the same day.  
The activity of drug metabolising enzymes ie CYPs can be modified during altered immunological 
states. Belimumab is an antibody directed against BLyS and can therefore be a cytokine modulator. 
This was addressed in a new in vitro study, evaluating the effect of BLyS on mRNA levels of CYP450 
enzymes. Although no effect was seen, no firm conclusion can be drawn since cytokine mediated drug-
drug interactions cannot currently be predicted using in vitro data. Information, describing the lack of 
information regarding cytokine mediated DDIs, has therefore been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC 
accordingly. 
The data on patients >65 years are limited to <1.8% of the population studied in clinical trials. This is 
reflected in the SmPC together with a statement that treatment of elderly patients is not recommended 
unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. The lack of data for some patient groups (e.g. 
elderly and patients with severe SLE affecting the kidneys or nervous system) is reflected in the RMP 
as missing information including appropriate pharmacovigilance measures. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers that data submitted on pharmacology are sufficient for this application. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Study BEL112341: 
A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 52-Week Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) Administered Subcutaneously 
(SC) to Subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - Open-label phase - End of 
Study report 
A single pivotal study (BEL 112341) was conducted to support the SC formulation. This was a Phase 3, 
multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of belimumab administered SC in adult subjects with active SLE. In addition to 
receiving stable standard therapy, eligible subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 
2:1 ratio: 200 mg belimumab weekly or placebo SC weekly.  
For the most part, the critical design elements of this SC study were the same as those utilized for the 
previous pivotal Phase 3 IV program. In BEL112341, subjects were randomized to belimumab or 
placebo (2:1 ratio) and study agent was administered SC on Day 0 and weekly thereafter to Week 51.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 30/92 
 
 
 
 
In C1056 and C1057, belimumab was administered IV on Days 0, 14 and 28 and every 28 days 
thereafter to Week 72 or Week 48, respectively. The primary endpoint for all 3 studies was at Week 52 
(C1056 had an additional double-blind period out to Week 76).

•  Clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria; 
•  Clinically active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA SLEDAI disease activity score of ≥8 at 
screening. Subjects had to have unequivocally positive autoantibody test results, either from 2 
independent time points within the study screening period or 1 positive historical test result 
and 1 positive test result during screening. Autoantibody test results obtained in the screening 
period were considered positive if the anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer was ≥1:80 and/or anti-
double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (antidsDNA) serum antibody was ≥30 IU/mL. 
•  Be on a stable SLE treatment regimen ≥30 days prior to Day 0 wherein stable treatment 
consisted of any of the following (alone or in combination): prednisone or equivalent (from 0 to 
40 mg/day when used in combination with other SLE treatment or from 7.5 to 40 mg/day 
when used alone), antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, quinacrine), non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory 
therapy (i.e., methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate, calcineurin inhibitors 
[e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine], sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 
mizoribine or thalidomide). 
The key exclusion criteria included the following:

urine protein to creatinine ratio, or serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL),or severe active lupus 
nephritis requiring acute therapy not permitted by protocol;  
•  Central nervous system lupus; 
• 
Pregnancy;  
•  Have received treatment with any B cell targeted therapy. (However, for centers in US, UK, 
Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, following local amendment to the protocol, treatment 
with B cell targeted therapy ≥1 year prior to screening was allowed; otherwise, receipt of any 
B cell target therapy at any time prior to screening was not allowed); 
•  Receipt within 1 year prior to Day 0 of investigational biologics other than B cell targeted 
therapy, or of abatacept;  
•  Receipt within 90 days prior to Day 0 of any anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, 
intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra), IV 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), prednisone >100 mg/day, or plasmapheresis;  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 31/92

immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent, anti-malarial, or NSAID, or any steroid 
injection;  
•  Receipt within 30 days prior to Day 0 a live vaccine or a change in dose of a corticosteroid, 
other immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent, anti-malarial, or NSAID;  
•  Subjects with evidence of serious suicide risk including any history of suicidal behavior in the 
last 6 months and/or any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS) in the last 2 months or who, in the investigator's opinion, posed a 
significant suicide risk; 
•  Having required management of acute or chronic infections (ie, chronic ongoing treatment with 
suppressive therapy or hospitalization or use of parenteral antibiotics within 60 days of Day 0); 
•  History of an anaphylactic reaction to parenteral administration of contrast agents, human or 
murine proteins or monoclonal antibodies; 
•  ≥Grade 3 laboratory abnormality (some exceptions permitted). 
Treatments 
200 mg belimumab or placebo control was administered weekly by SC injection. No premedication was 
stipulated by the study protocol. 
After randomization, subjects were dosed with blinded study agent on Day 0 and then weekly through 
51 weeks of treatment. Subjects who completed the initial treatment period (51 weeks of treatment 
with a final assessment at Week 52) were given the option to receive open label belimumab 200 mg 
SC weekly during an additional extension phase for 6 months.  
The 1st and 2nd doses of belimumab were administered under supervision at the study site on Day 0 
and Day 7 (± 1 day). Subjects were to remain at the clinic for 3 hours following the first two doses of 
the study agent for observation. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects/caregivers who were 
adequately trained were allowed to administer all subsequent doses at home.  
Comprehensive concomitant medication controls were implemented (Figure 6).

Figure 6:  Overview of concomitant medication rules in BEL112341 
Prohibited medication at any time during the study included other investigational agents (biologic or 
non-biologic), anti-TNF therapy, other biologics, intravenous immunoglobulin, IV cyclophosphamide, 
and plasmaferesis. 
Objectives 
Study objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of belimumab administered SC in adult subjects with 
SLE and the safety and tolerability of belimumab administered SC in adult subjects with SLE. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE responder index (SRI) response rate at Week 52. A SRI 
response was defined as:  
• 
≥ 4 point reduction from baseline in SELENA SLEDAI score, AND no worsening (increase of 
<0.30 points from baseline) in Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA), AND no new British Isles 
Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain 
scores compared with baseline at the time of assessment (i.e., at Week 52). 
The major secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
Time to first severe flare (as measured by the modified SLE Flare Index [SFI]); and  
Percent of subjects whose average prednisone dose has been reduced by ≥ 25% from baseline 
to ≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52 in subjects receiving greater than 7.5 mg/day at 
baseline. 
Serum belimumab concentrations were the pharmacokinetic endpoint. 
The safety endpoints were: adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), adverse events of special 
interest, clinical laboratory parameters, immunogenicity, and vital signs.

Sample size 
Approximately 816 subjects were planned to be randomized and treated in the study, with a target of 
at least 544 subjects receiving belimumab and 272 subjects receiving placebo. This sample size 
provided at least 90% power at a 5% level of significance to detect a minimum of 12% absolute 
improvement in response rate for the 200 mg belimumab group (assumed rate = 56%) relative to the 
placebo group (assumed rate = 44%) at Week 52. The selection of the 12% absolute improvement 
was based on the observed response rate in the Phase 3 IV studies.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, 200 mg belimumab or placebo control, in a 2:1 
ratio in accordance with the randomization schedule via an electronic data capture (EDC)-based IWRS. 
The randomization was stratified by screening SELENA SLEDAI score (8-9 vs. ≥10), complement level 
(C3 and/or C4 low vs. other) and race (Black vs. Other). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was blinded to belimumab. Belimumab for injection was supplied as double blinded prefilled 
syringes. The study agent was distributed by the site pharmacist or designee. Except for a limited 
number of safety oversight personnel, all study site personnel, the subject, the sponsor and the CRO 
were to remain blinded to the study agent received and to the results of certain biomarker and 
pharmacodynamic laboratory results. 
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a 
medical emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the 
investigational product was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. The 
Sponsor’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind treatment codes in 
the event of a SAE. Other GSK staff remained blinded to subjects’ treatment until data through the 
Week 52 primary efficacy analysis were locked and unblinded. 
Statistical methods 
For the analysis of the primary and the major secondary efficacy endpoints, a step-down sequential 
testing procedure was used to control the overall type 1 error rate. With this procedure, the primary 
and two major secondary endpoints were evaluated for statistical significance based on a pre-specified 
sequence for interpretation: (1) SRI response rate at Week 52, (2) time to first severe SLE flare, and 
(3) percent of subjects with average prednisone dose that has been reduced by ≥ 25% from baseline 
to ≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. Specifically, endpoints were tested in the sequence 
above (2-sided alpha=0.05) provided that statistical significance was achieved by all prior tests. 
A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of an SRI response. The independent 
variables in the model were treatment group, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤ 9 vs. ≥ 10), baseline 
complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (Black vs. Other). 
Overall the statistical methods are adequate for the analysis of the study data. For the analyses, 
baseline (rather than screening) values of the respective stratification factors were used since baseline 
values represent the status of the subject at the time study treatment is first administered. However, 
there was a high level of consistency between screening and baseline values of SELENA SLEDAI and 
complement.

Results 
Recruitment and Participant flow 
A total of 1427 subjects were screened to yield 839 randomized subjects, of whom 836 received at 
least 1 dose of study agent. The most common reasons for failed screening were failing to meet 
inclusion (n=347) or exclusion (n=180) eligibility criteria. The 836 subjects (280 in the placebo group 
and 556 in the belimumab 200 mg SC group) in the ITT population were enrolled across 177 sites in 
30 countries. Half the subjects in the ITT population were from the USA (28.3%) and Eastern Europe 
(22.5%); other regions where the study was conducted were the Americas excluding the USA and 
Canada (20.6%), Asia (20.6), and Western Europe (8.0). Most subjects (81.0%) completed the study 
through Week 52 (see Table 7).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint analyses results 
The SRI response at Week 52 was positive and statistically significant (48.4% placebo, 61.4% 
belimumab, p=0.0006) (table 9). Also, each of the 3 components reached statistical significance 
(p<0.05) 
(Table 10).  
The statistically significant differences in the SRI response were observed by Week 16 and sustained 
through Week 52 (Figure 7).

Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
The prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted for unadjusted response, LOCF response, 
completer response, and per protocol response.

The primary efficacy analysis at Week 52 was also repeated using the SLEDAI 2K proteinuria scoring 
rule which scores proteinuria as 4 points anytime the value is >0.5 g/24 h (rather than only with new 
onset or recent increase). The result of the SRI SLEDAI 2K analysis favored belimumab (odds ratio 
1.83; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.46; p<0.0001) and was consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. 
Analysis of the SRI was also performed using the EMA modified SRI response rate at Week 52. In the 
EMA modified endpoint, the 'No New BILAG 1A/2B domain score' component is replaced with 'No 
BILAG 1A/2B domain score' in the SRI.  
Major secondary endpoints 
Time to first severe SFI flare over 52 weeks 
Subjects in the belimumab 200 mg SC group had a 49% lower risk of experiencing a severe SFI flare 
compared with placebo; 10.6% of subjects in the belimumab group had a severe flare vs. 18.2% in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74; p=0.0004). Of those subjects 
experiencing a severe flare, the median number of days to first severe flare was 171.0 (25th, 75th 
percentile: 57.0, 257.0) in the belimumab group and 118.0 (25th, 75th percentile: 62.0, 259.0) in the 
placebo group. 
Percent of subjects whose average prednisone dose was reduced by ≥ 25% from baseline to ≤7.5 
mg/day during Week 40 through Week 52 
A greater proportion of subjects on belimumab 200 mg SC (18.2%) than placebo (11.9%) reduced 
their prednisone dose; the difference approached statistical significance (p=0.0732) (Table 11).

a. 
Odds Ratio (95% CI) and p-value are from a logistic regression model for the comparison between belimumab and 
placebo with covariates treatment group, baseline prednisone dose, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤9 vs. 
≥10), baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (Black vs. Other). 
This analysis was only conducted in subjects with baseline prednisone use >7.5 mg per day. This was 
the case for only a subgroup of subjects (503/836, 60.2%), and, similar to the IV studies, there was 
no requirement for forced tapering of steroids in the study.  
Other secondary endpoints 
Disease activity 
Results for the durable SRI response from Week 44 through Week 52 analysis were similar to the 
primary analysis. A greater proportion of subjects in the belimumab 200 mg SC group (54.3%) had a 
durable SRI response defined as a sustained SRI response from Week 44 through Week 52 compared 
with placebo (40.9%) (odds ratio 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.30; p=0.0004). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 38/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median number of days to first SRI response that was maintained through Week 52 was 235 days 
(=33.6 weeks) in the belimumab 200 mg SC group vs. 338 days (=48.3 weeks) in the placebo group. 
For this SRI endpoint, a greater proportion of subjects in the belimumab group (61.4%) were 
responders compared with the placebo group (48.4%) (Hazard Ratio 1.48; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.81; 
p=0.0001). 
No differences were observed for the mean change from baseline to Week 52 in the SLICC/ACR 
damage index (SDI) with adjusted mean changes of 0.1 for the placebo group and 0.0 for the 
belimumab group (p=0.1174). 
Flares 
Subjects in the belimumab 200 mg SC group had a 22% lower risk of a first SFI flare (any severity) 
over 52 weeks (Hazard ratio 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; p=0.0061). 
The adjusted rate ratio for SFI flares per subject-year from Day 0 to Week 52 was 19% lower for the 
belimumab 200 mg SC group compared to placebo group (p=0.0186). For severe SFI flares, the 
adjusted rate ratio per subject-year from Day 0 to Week 52 was 46% lower for the belimumab group 
compared to the placebo group (p=0.0128). 
Renal flares 
Overall, by Week 52, 21 (7.5%) of subjects in the placebo group experienced a renal flare in 
comparison to 26 (4.7%) in the belimumab group (Hazard Ratio 0.57; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.01; 
p=0.0532). Among subjects with baseline proteinuria >0.5 g/24 h, 13 (27.1%) in the placebo group 
experienced a renal flare, in comparison to 11 (11.1%) in the belimumab group (Hazard Ratio 0.40; 
95% CI: 0.18, 0.90; p=0.0272). 
The percent of subjects with at least one renal flare over the 52-week study period was small, likely a 
reflection of the eligibility criteria and the low rates of renal disease involvement at baseline.  
Cumulative prednisone dose 
The mean ± SD cumulative prednisone dose was 4567.3 ± 5981.53 mg over 52 weeks in the placebo 
group and 3933.8 ± 3660.76 mg over 52 weeks in the belimumab group. 
Health outcome results 
Subjects in the placebo and belimumab groups had an increased (improved) mean FACIT-Fatigue Scale 
score; the improvement was greater for subjects in the belimumab group. At Week 52, the adjusted 
mean change was 2.7 for the placebo group in comparison to 4.4 in the belimumab group (treatment 
difference 1.6; 95% CI 0.3, 2.9; p=0.0130; Among subjects in the placebo group, 101 (36.1%) 
experienced improvement in FACIT fatigue score exceeding the MCID (≥4) at Week 52, in comparison 
to 246 (44.4%) of subjects in the belimumab group (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.05, 1.94, p=0.0245). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint were conducted by age (<65 vs. ≥65 years), 
gender, baseline body weight quartiles and BMI categories, race, region, disease activity, baseline 
prednisone use, baseline average daily prednisone dose (yes vs. no), baseline MMF use, baseline 
medications, and immunogenicity status (Table 12).

Age and gender 
As most subjects were <65 years and female, the response in these subgroups was similar to the 
overall population. The relatively small number of subjects in the ≥65 years (n=19) and male (n=47) 
subgroups limits interpretation. 
Body weight and BMI subgroups 
The belimumab SC 200 mg fixed dosing represents a lower dosing regimen for those with higher body 
weight as compared with IV dosing at 10 mg/kg. However, a decrease in efficacy of belimumab SC 200 
mg in relation to higher body weight was not observed. Rather, the higher weight quartiles, Q3 and 
Q4, as well as BMI categories overweight/obese showed the greatest treatment differences 
numerically. As this was not expected, the Applicant was requested to discuss whether this could be 
explained e.g. by differences in disease activity between the weight subgroups. However, baseline 
disease characteristics (e.g. in terms of mean and median SELENA SLEDAI score) and SLE medication 
profiles by body weight quartiles and BMI categories generally showed no clear imbalance. The 
numerically somewhat lower placebo response rate in the Q4 quartile and the overweight and obese 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 41/92 
 
 
 
 
 
BMI categories may have contributed to the relatively larger treatment difference observed for these 
groups. 
Region 
For the USA/Canada subgroup 33.3% and 48.0% of the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively, 
met the SRI endpoint (odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.22; p=0.0298) (BEL112341 CSR, Table 2.81). 
For the Americas excluding USA/Canada, 61.4% and 80.9% of the placebo and belimumab groups 
respectively met the SRI endpoint (odds ratio 2.66, 95% CI: 1.31, 5.39; p=0.0068). However, in 
Western and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia, the observed difference in SRI response vs. placebo was 
numerically lower (ranging from 7.6 to 9.2%) and not statistically significant. 
As noted in the central advice (EMEA/H/SA/717/3/2011/III), efforts should be made to warrant that 
participants in the trial are sufficiently representative of the EU population. It appears that the region 
‘Americas excluding USA and Canada’ is a major driver of the overall results. Various regional 
differences in response rates were observed in the previous pivotal IV studies. For example, subjects in 
the US/Canada in the pivotal IV studies had lower response rates in all 3 treatment groups compared 
with all other regions and there was a smaller treatment difference between belimumab and placebo 
treatment groups. At that time, these regional differences were not fully clarified but considered to be 
related to factors such as imbalances in baseline disease activity. No such imbalances were observed in 
the current BEL112341 study and, in spite of some numeric differences between the various regions, 
there were positive treatment differences vs. placebo for all regions. Several of the subgroups, 
including Western Europe, were limited in size which could explain some of the variability observed. 
Disease activity 
Primary response was evaluated for disease activity subgroups based on baseline values of SELENA 
SLEDAI score, C3 and/or C4, anti-dsDNA, steroid use and dose, MMF use and other baseline 
medications (use of steroid and antimalarial and immunosuppressant vs. not use of all these 
medications) for Study BEL112341. In addition, a subgroup of baseline C3/C4 levels and anti-dsDNA 
(at least one C3/C4 low and anti-dsDNA ≥30 IU/mL vs. not having these baseline levels) was 
evaluated for the primary endpoint and additional efficacy endpoints. 
Selena SLEDAI subgroup 
SRI response rates were lower for the SELENA SLEDAI subgroup ≤9 points (41.4% and 48.5% for 
placebo and belimumab respectively) and were higher for the SELENA SLEDAI subgroup ≥10 points 
(53.0% and 68.8% for placebo and belimumab 200 mg respectively) as compared to the overall 
treatment response rates (48.4% and 61.4% for placebo and belimumab, respectively) (CSR 
BEL112341, Table 2.88 and Table 2.1). 
The SRI response rate at Week 52 for the SELENA SLEDAI subgroup ≥10 points (n=242) was 
statistically significantly different from placebo (15.77% difference, OR: 1.95 [1.34, 2.85], p=0.0005). 
This was not the case for the SELENA SLEDAI ≤9 subgroup (n=202) (7.1% difference, OR:1.33  [0.83, 
2.13], p=0.2302). 
Anti-dsDNA subgroup 
The SRI response rate at Week 52 for the high anti-dsDNA (≥30 IU/mL) subgroup (n=402) was 
statistically significantly different from placebo (12.97% difference, OR: 1.70 [1.20, 2.40], p=0.0028). 
This was not the case for the <30 IU/mL subgroup (n=152) (12.70% difference, OR:1.67 [0.98, 2.84], 
p=0.0596) (CSR BEL112341, Table 2.89). 
Low complement subgroup 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 42/92 
 
 
 
 
The low C3 and /or C4 subgroup demonstrated a higher response rate (64.3%) than either the No low 
C3 and/or C4 subgroup or the overall treatment groups (58.6% and 61.4%, respectively) for the 
belimumab groups (CSR BEL112341, Table 2.90 and Table 2.1).  
The SRI response rate at Week 52 for the low C3 and/or low C4 subgroup (n=269) was statistically 
significantly different from placebo (15.90% difference, OR: 1.92 [1.25, 2.95], p=0.0029). This was 
lower, although also significant, for the no low C3 or C4 subgroup (n=285) (10.23% difference, OR: 
1.51 [1.02, 2.24], p=0.0406). 
Low complement and positive anti-dsDNA subgroup 
For subjects with low complement and high anti-dsDNA, belimumab treatment demonstrated a greater 
response rate relative to placebo (observed difference vs. placebo 17.41%; odds ratio 2.23; 95% CI: 
1.36, 3.64, p=0.0014) as compared to the NOT low complement and high anti-dsDNA subgroup 
(observed difference vs. placebo 9.64%; odds ratio 1.46; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.14, p=0.0488). 
Analyses of time to first severe SFI flare were also conducted for this subgroup. For subjects with low 
complement and high anti-dsDNA, the risk of flare was significantly reduced as 31.55 of subjects in the 
placebo group developed a severe flare vs. 14.1% in the belimumab group (hazard ratio 0.38 [0.24, 
0.61), p<0.0001). The results for the NOT low complement and high anti-dsDNA subgroup were not 
significant, 9.9% subjects in the placebo and 7.8% of subjects in the belimumab group developed a 
severe flare (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.041, 1.41], p=0.3836).  
The results were similar for the additional efficacy endpoint of time to first flare over 52 weeks 
(regardless of severity), i.e. statistically significant for the high but not the low disease activity 
subgroup (p=0.0145 and p=0.0942), respectively (CSR BEL112341, Table 2.26). 
Findings for the other major secondary endpoint (percent of subjects whose average prednisone dose 
was reduced by ≥25% from baseline to ≤7.5 mg/day during Week 40 through Week 52) showed 
numerically greater response rates in the high disease activity (9.30% difference vs. placebo, OR: 2.08 
[0.91, 4.77], p=0.0844) compared to the low disease activity subgroup (3.54% difference vs. placebo, 
OR: 1.31 [0.62, 2.74], p=0.4767) (CSR BEL112341, Table 2.64).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The pivotal SC Phase 3 results were compared with the two previous Phase 3 IV studies C1056 and 
C1057 that supported the approval of IV belimumab 10 mg/kg.  
The Phase 3 studies were performed in antibody positive (positive ANA titer ≥ 1:80 and/or anti-dsDNA 
antibodies ≥ 30 IU/mL) SLE patients with active SLE disease (SELENA SLEDAI ≥ 8 in BEL112341 and 
SELENA SLEDAI ≥ 6 in C1056 and C1057) who were receiving standard therapy. 
Comparison of study populations 
In all 3 studies, the majority of subjects were female (93.3%-94.9%) and predominantly White. The 
mean age of subjects ranged from 35.5 to 40.2 years. Only 1.3%-2.0% of subjects were ≥65 years 
across the 3 studies. In all 3 Phase 3 studies, the majority of subjects were taking steroids at baseline, 
although fewer subjects in C1056 (45.9%) were taking prednisone >7.5 mg/day at baseline than in 
C1057 (69.4%) or BEL112341 (60.2%). The majority of subjects across the studies were taking anti-
malarials; more subjects in C1056 were taking immunosuppressants and/or NSAIDs than in C1057 or 
BEL112341. 
Overall, patient demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between BEL112341 and the 
pooled IV Phase 3 studies. The mean overall SELENA SLEDAI score in BEL112341 was slightly higher 
(10.4 as compared to 9.7 in the pooled Phase 3 IV trials) which reflects the inclusion criteria (see Table 
14).

For the SC Phase 3 study the primary efficacy endpoint of SRI response at Week 52 was statistically 
significant. The odds of a subject being an SRI responder on belimumab 200 mg SC in BEL112341 was 
similar to that of a subject being an SRI responder on belimumab 10 mg/kg IV in studies C1056 and 
C1057 (Table 15).

a.  For C1056 and C1057, Odds Ratio (95% CI) and p-values were from logistic regression for the comparison between each 
belimumab dose and placebo with covariates. For individual studies, covariates include baseline SELENA SLEDAI score 
(≤9 vs. ≥10), baseline proteinuria level (<2 g/24 hour vs. ≥2 g/24 hour equivalent) and race (AIA vs. Other).  
For BEL112341, Odds Ratio (95% CI) and p-value are from a logistic regression model for the comparison between 
belimumab and placebo with covariates treatment group, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤9 vs. ≥10), baseline 
complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (Black vs. Other).

b.  Three ITT subjects did not have a baseline PGA assessment and therefore, do not contribute to SRI/component analyses. 
An additional (post-hoc) analysis of the IV Phase 3 trials using the same SELENA SLEDAI score cut-off 
(≥ 8) as the SC study showed a similar (numerically slightly higher) observed difference vs. placebo of 
15.6% responders for the 10 mg/kg dose group (OR 1.90; CI: 1.45, 2.50). 
Overall, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint of SRI response at Week 52 for study BEL112341 
are thus consistent with the Phase 3 IV trials with belimumab administered 10 mg/kg.

Results for belimumab SC and IV (each when compared to placebo) were also consistent in analyses 
that used higher thresholds of SELENA SLEDAI reduction in calculating the SRI (SRI5-8, see table 
below), with statistically significant odds ratios in favour of belimumab (Table 16).

10.6% on belimumab 200 mg SC. This is consistent with the 10 mg/kg findings from C1057 and the 
pooled IV Phase 3 studies (Table 17).

The results for study BEL112341 for this key secondary endpoint are consistent with the Phase 3 IV 
studies. 
Selected subgroup analyses 
In the Phase 3 IV studies, the subgroup of patients with positive anti-dsDNA and low C3 or C4 was 
shown to have greater benefit from belimumab treatment than the overall population. In BEL112341, 
the treatment difference for the SRI response in this subgroup was consistent with that seen in the 
pooled Phase 3 IV data (Table 19).  
For the major secondary endpoint of time to first severe flare, belimumab treatment was superior to 
placebo in the group with higher disease activity. For the major secondary endpoint of prednisone 
reduction by ≤25% from baseline to ≤7.5 mg/day during Week 40 through Week 52, there was a 
trend for more reductions in the belimumab group compared to the placebo group in the high disease 
activity group, but the difference was not statistically significant.

BEL112341 open-label extension phase 
Subjects who completed the double-blind phase of the study could participate in a 6-month open-label 
extension phase, receiving belimumab 200 mg SC weekly. The first dose was given ~1 week after the 
last dose of the double-blind phase, i.e., at Week 52. Participating subjects continued to be monitored 
for safety and, at a reduced frequency, efficacy. More latitude was permitted for changes in 
background medication during the extension phase. For analysis of the open-label phase, baseline for 
both treatment groups was defined as the last pre-belimumab assessment. Thus, for the belimumab 
200 mg SC group, baseline was Day 0 of the double-blind phase and for the placebo to belimumab 200 
mg SC group, baseline was the Week 52 assessment.  
A total of 662 out of the 677 subjects that completed the double-blind part of the study were enrolled 
and received at least one dose of belimumab 200 mg SC during open label. Of these, 206 subjects 
switched from placebo during the double-blind phase to belimumab 200 mg SC and 456 subjects had 
received belimumab 200 mg SC for 52 weeks during the double-blind phase continued to receive 
belimumab during the open-label phase. 
The percentage of SRI responders during the open-label phase at open-label Week 24/Exit was 16.1% 
for subjects in the placebo to belimumab 200 mg group and 76.3% for subjects in the belimumab 200 
mg SC group. However, the different duration of exposure to belimumab and definition of baseline 
between the groups should be considered. No statistical testing was performed for the open-label 
phase data. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in the paediatric population have been performed with belimumab until now.  
Based on PK data and subgroup analyses in study BEL112341, no dose adjustment is recommended 
for elderly patients or with respect to gender, race and ethnicity, body weight, renal impairment, 
hepatic function, or disease state, consistent with the IV formulation.  
No specific clinical studies have been performed in elderly. 
Supportive studies 
Study 200339 (real-life use of autoinjector device) 
Study 200339 was an open-label, single-arm; multi-dose study of belimumab (200 mg) administered 
SC via an autoinjector in subjects with SLE who had previously received belimumab. The study was 
designed to assess the suitability of an autoinjector for self-administration of belimumab. Other 
objectives were to evaluate injection failures related to use (use errors) or device performance (device 
errors), the safety and tolerability of belimumab administered via the autoinjector, and to characterize 
the change in belimumab trough concentrations when switching from IV to SC administration. 
SLE patients switching from 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks to 200 mg SC every week used a 1 to 4 week 
interval between the first SC dose and the last IV dose. Eligible subjects self-administered belimumab 
SC (200 mg/mL formulation) into the thigh or abdomen using the autoinjector for 8 weekly doses 
starting at Day 0; 4 doses were administered under observation in the clinic and 4 were administered 
outside the clinic and without observation.  
A total of 95 subjects were enrolled. Ninety subjects administered the first 2 injections in the study and 
87 administered their drug at home through Week 7. A high proportion (89/90: 99%) of subjects had 
successful injections in their observed first and second doses using the autoinjector in Weeks 1 and 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 52/92 
 
 
 
 
A high proportion of subjects were also able to successfully self-administer their observed dose of 
belimumab 200 mg SC using the autoinjector at Weeks 4 and 8 (85/87: 98%) and outside the clinic 
setting at Weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7 (81/87: 93%). Over the 8-week treatment period, a total of 736 once 
weekly injections were attempted and 720 (98%) injections were concluded to be successful. 
The median of belimumab serum concentration at Week 8 was 113 µg/mL, indicating that the average 
steady-state exposure for weekly 200 mg belimumab SC was similar to the Cavg of 110 µg/mL for 10 
mg/kg belimumab IV every 4 weeks.  
For switching intervals between 2 and 4 weeks, median Week 8 to Week 1 differences in belimumab 
concentrations were close to zero, i.e., subjects were most likely to start close to their steady-state 
belimumab level when switched from IV to SC with a 2-4 week time interval. On the other hand, the 
median % changes between Week 8 and Week 1 in belimumab trough concentration was more than 
50% for switching intervals of ≤1.5 weeks.  
Human factor validation reports TR-06-15-009 (autoinjector) and TR-06-15-008 (safety syringe) 
Both studies included a total of 30 participants divided into two user groups including (1) 15 SLE 
patients who received representative training on how to use the device representing the high-risk 
intended user population for this device considering their physical symptoms and lack of experience 
using such devices to self-administer subcutaneous injections and (2) 15 healthcare providers (HCPs) 
who self-trained by using the materials provided in the representative product pack.  
In both studies, all participants (30/30, 100%) successfully prepared and carried out the full injection 
procedure. There were no patterns of (preventable) failures or use errors observed. The results of 
these studies indicate a reliable usability of the devices (commercial prefilled syringe and autoinjector) 
and label comprehension by representative users under realistic conditions. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH has developed a belimumab SC formulation for the same indication as approved for the IV 
formulation, i.e. as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE with a high 
degree of disease activity. The product was developed as an alternative to the IV formulation as some 
physicians and patients may have a preference for an SC option. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH conducted a single pivotal Phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 52 week trial 
(BEL 112341) to support the SC formulation. For the most part, the critical design elements of this SC 
study were the same as those utilized for the previous pivotal Phase 3 IV program.  
A few adaptations were made, including the use of raised entry criteria for the SELENA SLEDAI score at 
screening from ≥ 6 to≥ 8. This change was made based on the results from the IV studies which 
showed that patients with higher disease activity, as reflected by a higher SELENA SLEDAI score, were 
more likely to respond to belimumab. This change is considered acceptable. The primary efficacy 
endpoint, SRI response rate at Week 52, is unchanged from the previous pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
Other differences included removal of male subject contraception requirements and allowing previous 
use of IV cyclophosphamide within 3 months prior to Day 0 instead of 6 months. Also, subjects with 
evidence of serious suicide risk were specifically excluded in the SC study. This stipulation was 
considered to facilitate the assessment of the impact of belimumab, if any, on serious psychiatric 
events.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 53/92 
 
 
 
 
The fixed dose of the SC formulation, 200 mg administered once weekly is targeting a similar overall 
exposure in terms of AUC at steady state as compared with monthly IV dosing of 10 mg/kg. This 
approach is considered as reasonable under the assumption that overall exposure is a good predictor 
of efficacy. 
Overall, the design of study BEL112341 for the purpose of characterising the efficacy and safety of 
belimumab SC in adult patients with SLE supported by the previously conducted studies with the IV 
formulation is considered acceptable. 
The final commercial device formats (autoinjector and safety syringe) were not included in the pivotal 
Phase 3 trial. The device bridging program included laboratory based performance testing, human 
factors studies and clinical studies (autoinjector only). Study BEL117100 assessed the relative 
bioavailability of a single dose of SC belimumab formulation 06-D for the autoinjector and the prefilled 
syringe in healthy volunteers. In addition, usability and reliability of the autoinjector device with 
respect to chronic real-life use by adult subjects with SLE were evaluated in Study 200339. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
BEL112341 showed that belimumab 200 mg CS in addition to standard therapy achieved a greater 
proportion of SRI responders at Week 52 compared to placebo plus standard therapy (48.4% placebo, 
61.4% belimumab, p=0.0006). These results were in line with the underlying assumptions of the 
study. The odds of a subject being an SRI responder on SC belimumab (odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% CI: 
1.25. 2.25; p=0.0006) was similar to that of a subject being an SRI responder in the pooled IV studies 
using belimumab 10 mg/kg (OR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.15; p<0.0001).  
Belimumab also demonstrated efficacy in each of the components of the SRI (≥ 4 point reduction in 
SELENA SLEDAI score over baseline, no worsening in PGA (<0.3 point increase over baseline, no new 
BILAG 1A or 2B scores) (all p<0.05). The prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary SRI endpoint 
were all statistically significant, consistent with the primary results. This included analyses that used a 
5 to 8 point difference in the SELENA SLEDAI score in the SRI (SRI5 to SRI8). 
In an additional modified analysis replacing the” No New BILAG 1A/2B domain score” component with 
“No BILAG 1A/2B domain score” the treatment difference remained significant in BEL112341 (OR 1.62; 
95% CI: 1.20, 2.17; p=0.0014). 
The differences in SRI response rate observed between the belimumab and placebo groups were 
numerically superior by Week 8, with statistical significance obtained by Week 16 and sustained 
through Week 52. To compare, in C1057 and the pooled C1056 and C1057 analyses, the differences in 
SRI response were statistically significant at Week 16 and from Week 24 to Week 52 for the 10 mg/kg 
group. In C1056 the difference was statistically significant at Week 52, but not earlier. 
As the first major secondary endpoint, belimumab reduced the risk of subjects experiencing at least 1 
severe flare by 49% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74; p=0.0004). The second major 
endpoint, conducted in the subgroup of subjects who were receiving >7.5 mg/day of prednisone at 
baseline, showed a numerically higher proportion of subjects reduced their steroid dose by ≥ 25% to 
≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 to 52 compared to placebo subjects; the difference approached 
statistical significance. The results for these endpoints were consistent with the IV program. 
In BEL112341, subjects were required to have a SELENA SLEDAI score of ≥ 8 at screening. In total 773 
of 836 (92.5%) of subjects had this score at baseline. The response rate in this subgroup was similar 
to the overall study population (difference vs. placebo 13.25%, odds ratio 1.72; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.34; 
p=0.0006). Given that the SELENA SLEDAI inclusion criterion was slightly different from the IV 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 54/92 
 
 
 
 
program, a post-hoc analysis was conducted of this same subgroup (baseline SELENA SLEDAI score 
≥ 8) in the IV Phase 3 trials which showed a (numerically slightly higher) observed difference vs. 
placebo of 15.6% responders for the 10 mg/kg dose group (OR 1.90; CI: 1.45, 2.50). 
SRI analysis was performed using 3 definitions of high disease activity: a SELENA SLEDAI score of 
≥ 10, low C3 and/or low C4, and the combination of anti-dsDNA positivity and low complement. 
Analysis of the major secondary endpoints was also performed for those subjects with both anti-dsDNA 
positivity and low complement. Consistent with the IV program, a more robust effect of belimumab 
treatment was observed in subjects with higher levels of disease activity. 
Subjects with low complement and positive anti-dsDNA demonstrated a treatment difference for 
belimumab relative to placebo of 17.41% more responders (odds ratio 2.23; 95% CI: 1.36, 3.64; 
p=0.0014) (as compared to a delta of 9.64 for the not low complement/anti-dsDNA subgroup and 
12.98 for the overall population). This subgroup also showed a more pronounced effect on prevention 
of severe flare with 62% reduced risk of severe flare compared to placebo (HR 0.38; p <0.0001). The 
other major secondary endpoint relating to prednisone reduction did not reach statistical significance 
((20.7% vs. 11.4%; p=0.0844). 
At baseline in BEL112341, 147 subjects (17.6%) had proteinuria >0.5g/24. In this subgroup, the 
percentage of subjects with renal flares was also decreased in this subgroup in the belimumab group 
compared to placebo with 11.1% of belimumab subjects with proteinuria at baseline experiencing a 
renal flare, compared to 27.1% of placebo subjects with proteinuria at baseline (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 
0.18, 0.90; p=0.0272). 
Belimumab SC 200 mg fixed dosing dose represent a lower dosing regimen for those with higher body 
weight compared with IV dosing at 10 mg/kg. However, the efficacy of belimumab 200 mg SC fixed 
dosing was not negatively impacted by increasing body weight. 
In some regions, including Western and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia, the observed difference in SRI 
response vs. placebo was numerically lower (ranging from 7.6 to 9.2%) and not statistically significant. 
Overall, however, the results from study BEL112341 appear to be consistent with the efficacy 
demonstrated in the IV Phase 3 registration program (studies C1056 and C1057). 
The devices intended planned for commercial use (the autoinjector and prefilled syringe with needle 
guard) were not utilized in the Phase 3 study but employ the same prefilled syringe as primary drug 
container closure as was used in the Phase 3 study. As part of the device bridging program, the 
usability and reliability of the autoinjector device with respect to chronic real-life use by adult subjects 
with SLE were evaluated. Likewise, a human factors validation studies were conducted to demonstrate 
reliable usability of the devices (commercial prefilled syringe and autoinjector) and label 
comprehension by representative users under realistic conditions. The results from these studies were 
considered as supportive. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the belimumab SC Phase 3 trial, BEL112341, combined with the previous belimumab 
IV Phase 3 program demonstrate the efficacy for belimumab 200 mg SC as an add-on treatment to 
standard therapy for the indicated population, i.e. adult patients with active autoantibody-positive SLE 
with a high degree of disease activity despite standard therapy.  
The CHMP considers the application approvable from a clinical efficacy point of view.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary safety population for belimumab SC is comprised of the subjects from study BEL112341.  
The primary safety population of the supporting IV program was comprised of subjects from the Phase 
2 study LBSL02 and the 2 Phase 3 studies C1056 and C1057 (all together, the CRD studies). 
Patient exposure 
In the SC BEL112341 study 836 subjects participated, of whom 556 (66.5%) received belimumab. The 
primary safety population for the IV formulation includes 2133 subjects of whom 68.4% (1458/2133) 
were administered belimumab.

Note: Subjects only counted once per SOC. Only treatment-emergent AEs are summarized.  
MedDRA version 17.1 
The incidence of AEs by SOC was generally similar for the belimumab SC group compared to placebo. 
As also shown in Table 21, the incidence of AEs reporting for both active and placebo tended to be 
lower in the SC study as compared to the pooled IV studies.  
In study BEL112341, common treatment-emergent AE PTs were headache (9.3% placebo, 10.3% 
belimumab 200 mg SC), urinary tract infection bacterial (6.4% placebo, 7.6% belimumab), and 
arthralgia (3.9% placebo, 5.8% belimumab) were reported more frequently for belimumab and at least 
1% greater incidence than for placebo. Frequent AEs that occurred more commonly in the placebo 
group and at least 1% greater incidence than belimumab were nasopharyngitis (7.9% placebo, 6.8% 
belimumab), nausea (7.9% placebo, 6.8% belimumab), cough (6.8% placebo, 4.0% belimumab), and 
insomnia (7.1% placebo, 3.2% belimumab). 
The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study agent in 
study BEL112341 was 26% for the placebo group and 31% for the belimumab 200 mg SC group. The 
SOC with the highest incidence of drug-related AEs overall was infections and infestations (19% 
placebo, 19% belimumab). The PT with the highest incidence of drug-related AEs overall was herpes 
zoster (3.2% placebo, 2.2% belimumab). Incidences in the belimumab group were similar to or lower 
than those in the placebo group for the majority of drug related AEs. 
The majority of AEs in study BEL112341 were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of severe 
(including life-threatening) AEs in the placebo group was 14.3% compared with 9.9% in the 
belimumab group.

Local injection site reactions occurred in 2.5% and 6.1% of subjects in the placebo and belimumab 200 
mg SC groups, respectively. All local injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity, and no 
serious local injection site events were reported. There were 64 events of local injection site reactions 
in 34 belimumab-treated subjects as compared to 12 events in 7 placebo-treated patients during the 
double-blind phase of the study. The first appearance of local reactions was reported somewhat more 
frequently during the two injections of belimumab (in 11 subjects in total) but they also occurred 
during later phases of the study. Most local site injection reactions started on the day the injection was 
administered and almost all events resolved. (Table 22) 
Two subjects in the belimumab group discontinued due to a local injection site reaction. Subject 
discontinued due to injection site induration (moderate, definitely related) that occurred 3 days after 
receiving the second dose of belimumab, and Subject discontinued due to injection site erythema 
(mild, probably related) that began 4 days after receiving the second dose of belimumab.

Post-Injection/Infusion Systemic Reactions 
In study BEL112341, the incidences of post-injection systemic reactions in the belimumab 200 mg SC 
group were lower than or similar to that in the placebo group for each category.  
The incidences of post injection systemic reactions per anaphylactic reaction custom MedDRA query 
(CMQ) broad search were 8.6% in the placebo and 6.8% in the belimumab groups. 
For post injection systemic reactions per anaphylactic reaction custom MedDRA query (CMQ) broad 
search that were serious, the incidence in the placebo group and the belimumab group was 0 and 
0.2%, respectively. Serious delayed non-acute hypersensitivity reactions per sponsor adjudication 
were low in both treatment groups (0.4% placebo, 0 belimumab). No serious anaphylaxis per Sampson 
criteria, serious acute post injection systemic reactions, serious acute hypersensitivity reactions, or 
serious delayed acute hypersensitivity reactions occurred.

There were slightly more cases in the belimumab group over the course of the first 6 injections but no 
obvious differences between the groups. No premedication was required as part of the study drug 
treatment regimen during the study and none is recommended in the SmPC for the SC formulation.  
Three subjects were withdrawn from study treatment with belimumab as a result of systemic reaction 
events. One subject in the SC belimumab group was discontinued from study BEL112341 due to 
swelling face, lip swelling, and anaphylactic reaction (all moderate, possibly related) that occurred 1 
day after receiving the first dose of belimumab; the subject was not premedicated prior to injection 
and was subsequently treated with depo-medrol 80 mg and celestone soluspan 30 mg. The subject 
already was being treated with steroids as concomitant medication. The patient had a history of skin 
photosensitivity but no reported history of (systemic) allergic reactions. Subject eported severe allergic 
pruritis and urticaria that started on the day of the first injection and resolved after 3 days. Belimumab 
was considered probably related and was withdrawn as a result of these events. Subject developed 
multiple rashes of mild severity 2 days after the fourth dose that resolved after 7 days. Belimumab 
was considered probably not related but was nevertheless withdrawn as a result of the events.  
• 
Infections including opportunistic infections 
In study BEL112341, the incidence of AESI infections was lower among the belimumab SC treated 
subjects (5.4%) than that observed among the placebo-treated subjects (7.5%). The incidence of 
serious AESI was 1.4% for belimumab as compared to 1.1% for the placebo group.  
There were 2 serious opportunistic infections in the belimumab 200 mg group (2/556 [0.4%], namely 
TB and Candida, extra-oral/esophageal (per GSK adjudication) and none in placebo. 
•  Malignant neoplasms 
Malignancies reported during the double-blind phase of study BEL112341 consisted solely of solid 
tumors, which occurred in 0.4% of subjects in each treatment group. The PTs for the 2 solid tumors 
reported in the belimumab group were endometrial cancer (0.2%) and intraductal proliferative breast 
lesion (0.2%), and the solid tumor reported for the placebo group was breast cancer (0.4%). 
• 
Depression/ suicide/self-injury 
In study BEL112341, suicidality was assessed at every visit using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS). There were no events reported in the placebo group and 3 subjects with treatment 
emergent suicidal ideations per the C-SSRS in the belimumab 200 mg SC group (2 events were in 
ideation category 3 of “Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act” and 
1 in ideation category 1 of “Non-specific active suicidal thoughts.” No behavior events were reported.  
The incidence of depression AESI per CMQ was 3.6% in the placebo group and 2.7% in the belimumab 
200 mg SC group. 
Safety findings from the BEL112341 open-label extension phase 
The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE during the open-label phase was 49.2% and 
similar between the groups. The most frequent (≥3% in any treatment group) treatment-emergent 
AEs were viral upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, urinary tract infection bacterial, and 
nasopharyngitis. No treatment-emergent AEs were reported in ≥5% of subjects in either treatment 
group.  
Overall, local injection site reactions occurred in 1.5% and 0.2% of subjects in the placebo to 
belimumab 200 mg SC and belimumab 200 mg SC groups, respectively. During the open-label phase, 
all local injection site reactions were mild in severity.  
Assessment report

Page 61/92 
 
 
 
 
Post-injection systemic reactions occurred in 4.4% and 2.6% of subjects in the placebo to belimumab 
200 mg SC and belimumab 200 mg SC groups, respectively. A total of 4 (0.6%) subjects had serious 
post-injection systemic reactions per anaphylactic reaction customized MedDRA query (CMQ) broad 
search during the open-label phase, 1 (0.5%) subject in the placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC group 
and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the belimumab 200 mg SC group. 
Regarding other AESI, no subjects had a malignant neoplasm AESI during the open-label phase. 
Infection AESI occurred in 3.4% and 2.2% of subjects in the placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC and 
belimumab 200 mg SC groups, respectively. Serious infections included one subject with herpes zoster 
and one with mycobacterial infection in the placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC group and one case each 
of staphylococcal sepsis and tuberculosis in the belimumab 200 mg SC continuation group. Rates of 
depression/suicide/self-injury event AESIs were similar between the groups (1.8% overall).  
In the double-blind phase of study BEL112341, no subject had tested positive for immunogenicity 
following belimumab 200 mg SC administration. Three subjects tested positive following belimumab 
200 mg SC administration during the open-label phase or at the 8-Week Follow-up visit. All 3 of these 
subjects had negative values on subsequent follow-up testing. 
Overall, the data from the open-label phase of study BEL112341 did not evoke any new safety 
concerns. 
Safety findings from other studies 
Study 2003339 
Study 200339 was a Phase 2 real-life use study of belimumab 200 mg administered SC weekly for 8 
weeks to subjects with SLE using the autoinjector (formulation 06-D, 200 mg/mL). 
A total of 95 subjects were enrolled and treated with at least 1 dose of belimumab 200 mg SC and 
were included in the ITT population. Of these subjects, 91 (96%) subjects completed the study and 4 
(4%) subjects prematurely withdrew from the study. The reason for withdrawal was due to an AE for 3 
of these 4 subjects. A total of 93 (98%) subjects had received previous belimumab IV treatment and 2 
(2%) subjects received previous belimumab SC treatment prior to enrolling into the study. A total of 
90 (95%) subjects resumed or started belimumab IV treatment after the study. The most common AE 
SOCs (≥5% of subjects) were infections and infestations (19%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (13%), general disorders and administration site conditions (11%), and gastrointestinal 
disorders (9%). 
Treatment-emergent AEs reported in more than 2 subjects were nausea (6%), arthralgia (4%), and 
bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhea, systemic lupus erythematosus (all 3%). A total of 2 (2%) subjects had a 
treatment-emergent infection AESI during the study. Herpes zoster AESI were reported in 2 (2%) 
subjects. One (1%) subject had a herpes zoster AESI that led to discontinuation of study agent. 
Overall, a total of 3 (3%) subjects had treatment-emergent AEs that led to discontinuation of 
belimumab 200 mg SC during the study: 1 subject or an SAE of postoperative abscess; 1 subject for 
AEs of nausea, vomiting and pyrexia; and 1 subject or the AE of herpes zoster.  
Long-term continuation studies (belimumab IV) 
In the initial submission, data (interim reporting) from 3 repeat-dose long term studies of belimumab 
IV in subjects with SLE, BEL112626, BEL112233, and BEL112234, were integrated for long term 
continuation (LTC) safety analyses (DLP of 08 September 2014). SAE data from the ongoing LTC 
studies (BEL112234 and BEL112626) from 09 September 2014 to 08 March 2016 were also presented. 
Assessment report

Additional SAE data with a cut-off date of 22 October 2016 was provided as part of the Day 120 LoQ 
response. 
Overall, the LTC data including the additional SAE data did not evoke any new safety concerns. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In study BEL112341, a total of 5 deaths occurred in the double-blind phase of the study, 2 (0.7%) in 
the placebo group and 3 (0.5%) in the belimumab 200 mg SC group. The 3 deaths in the belimumab 
group were due to infection and the 2 deaths in the placebo group were cardiac arrest and 
thrombocytopenia.

One additional subject in the belimumab group died off study of Grade 4 life threatening sepsis 143 
days after her last dose of belimumab. The subject had withdrawn from the study on Day 28 due to 
the AE of mild, non-serious injection site erythema considered related to study agent. The subject had 
been admitted to hospital 125 days after the last dose of belimumab due to haemorrhagic shock 
secondary to bleeding esophageal varices. 
In study BEL112341, SAEs were reported for approximately 16% and 11% of subjects in the placebo 
and belimumab 200 mg SC groups, respectively. The SOC with the highest incidence of SAEs overall 
was infections and infestations (5.4% placebo, 4.1% belimumab). The incidence of AEs by SOC was 
generally similar for the belimumab SC group compared to placebo. 
By PT, the only SAE reported for >1% of subjects in either treatment group was thrombocytopenia 
(1.1% placebo, 0 belimumab). SAEs reported in >0.5% of subjects in either treatment group were 
cellulitis, pneumonia, pneumonia bacterial, renal failure acute, thrombocytopenia, dysphagia, 
headache, lupus vasculitis, and nephrotic syndrome. No trends of concern were observed. 
During the open-label phase of the study BEL112341 two (0.3%) subjects died (table 26): 
Table 26: Listing of Deaths in the Open-Label Phase of Study BEL112341 (ITT population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017

1 death in the placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC group was due to metabolic acidosis following events 
of antiphospolipid syndrome, acute kidney injury and deep vein thrombosis. One death in the 
belimumab 200 mg SC group was an infection-related death due to pneumonia and acute respiratory 
failure due to an SAE of community-acquired pneumonia 393 days after the first dose of belimumab. 
The reported cause of death was acute respiratory failure, considered unrelated to belimumab by the 
investigator. However, a causal relationship to the infection cannot be excluded. 
SAEs were reported for 5.9% of subjects (6.8% placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC, 5.5% belimumab 
200 mg SC) during the open-label phase with no meaningful differences between the groups. The 
overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent during the open-label phase was 
2.6% for all subjects (2.4% placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC, 2.6% belimumab 200 mg SC).  
Laboratory findings 
The clinical laboratory profile as well as observations related to vital signs for study BEL112341 was 
consistent with the IV formulation. There were no new safety concerns. 
Reductions in immunoglobins and changes in B cell subsets by belimumab administered SC were 
similar to those seen in the IV Phase 3 program over the course of 52 weeks. This supports the overall 
expectation that the long-term safety profile of belimumab 200 mg SC will reflect that of the IV 
formulation. 
Safety in special populations 
In study BEL112341, subgroup analyses of AEs by age (<65, ≥ 65 years), gender, race, and body 
weight were conducted. The AE profile of females was representative of the overall AE profile of the 
CRD studies since female subjects represented 94.1% of the overall population and the number of 
male subjects was small. Similarly, <2% of the overall population were ≥ 65 years of age; thus 
meaningful comparisons in age subgroups or between the treatment groups for the subgroup of 
subjects ≥ 65 years of age are not possible.  
When examined by geographic region revealed similar patterns without imbalances in treatment 
groups for study BEL112341 and the pooled CRD studies. Also, the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AESIs 
was similar in subjects with baseline positive anti-dsDNA and low C3/C4 (anti-dsDNA ≥ 30 IU/mL and 
at least one C3/C4 low) and NOT with anti-dsDNA ≥ 30 IU/mL and at least one C3/C4 low and with the 
overall population. 
Incidences of AEs and SAEs were generally similar across weight quartiles.

A total of 11 pregnancies were reported during the double-blind phase of the study. Three pregnancies 
were in subjects receiving placebo: 1 resulted in an induced abortion, 1 was lost to follow-up, and 1 
was ongoing at the time of reporting. Eight pregnancies were in subjects receiving belimumab: 4 
resulted in a normal live birth with no apparent congenital anomaly, 2 resulted in a spontaneous 
abortion, 1 resulted in an induced abortion, and 1 was ongoing at the time of reporting. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The current application did not reveal new safety concerns related to drug-drug interactions and other 
interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study BEL112341, the overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was 8.9% 
for the placebo group and 7.2% for the belimumab 200 mg SC group. The most common SOC for AEs 
leading to discontinuation was infections and infestations (2.5%) for the placebo group and renal and 
urinary disorders (1.4%) for the belimumab group.  
Two subjects treated with belimumab SC discontinued due to mild to moderate injection site-related 
AEs. 
One subject in the belimumab group was discontinued due to swelling face, lip swelling, and 
anaphylactic reaction (all moderate, possibly related); the subject was not premedicated prior to 
injection and was treated for the event with depo-medrol 80 mg and celestone soluspan 30 mg. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs resulting in study agent discontinuation reported for belimumab 200 mg 
SC (7.2%) was similar to that for the belimumab group in the pooled IV studies (6.0%). 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent during the open-label phase of 
study BEL112341 was 2.4% for placebo to belimumab 200 mg SC and 2.6% belimumab 200 mg SC). 
One subject in the placebo to belimumab group discontinued due to local injection site-related AEs. 
Subject discontinued due to injection site urticaria (mild, definitely related) that occurred 15 days after 
receiving the first dose of belimumab. One subject in the belimumab 200 mg SC group was 
discontinued due to SAEs of eyelid edema, lip swelling, rash pruritic, and urticaria (severe, definitely 
related) that occurred 382 days after receiving the first dose of belimumab and 2 days after the last 
dose during the open-label phase. 
Post marketing experience 
Based on sales data, cumulative post marketing exposure up to 08 March 2016 is estimated to be 
37,081 patient years. Review of post marketing safety data is conducted on an ongoing basis in order 
to identify new safety signals which may arise from clinical trial and/or post-marketing reports. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A new formulation of belimumab has been developed which enables SC administration utilizing either a 
prefilled syringe or an autoinjector. The proposed formulation is a 200 mg/mL solution for injection for 
single 1 mL injection once weekly into either the thigh or the abdomen.  
The primary safety population for the belimumab SC formulation was comprised of the subjects from 
the 52-week pivotal Phase 3 study BEL112341. This pivotal Phase 3 study (fixed dose 200 mg weekly) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 65/92 
 
 
 
 
targeted a similar average belimumab exposure as the 10 mg/kg IV dose which is marketed and a SLE 
population consistent with the population studied in the Phase 3 IV trials. Accordingly, the same 
potential and identified risks, as well as AEs of special interest (AESI) that apply to the IV product were 
also prospectively-defined AESI for the SC development program. 
The primary safety population from the supporting IV program was comprised of subjects from the 
Phase 2 study LBSL02 and the 2 Phase 3 studies C1056 and C1057. A total of 2969 subjects were 
included in the ITT population for these CRD studies including 836 subjects in SC study BEL112341 and 
2133 subjects in the 3 IV studies. Of these subjects, 68% (2014/2969) were treated with belimumab, 
556 subjects with belimumab 200 mg SC and 1458 subjects with belimumab IV (1, 4, or 10 mg/kg). 
Overall, the approach for the evaluation of safety in the context of the previous IV studies is endorsed. 
The overall incidence of AEs reporting for both active and placebo tended to be lower in the SC study 
as compared to the pooled IV studies. It seems feasible that this might partly relate to a different 
mode of administration of study agent but possibly also to the SC study being conducted when the IV 
formulation was already approved (the study was initiated November 2011). Also, there were some 
differences in enrolment by region with a higher proportion of subjects in study BEL112341 
randomized from Eastern Europe and fewer from the US/Canada as compared to the pooled IV studies.  
In the pivotal study BEL112341, the AE profile of belimumab 200 mg SC plus standard therapy was 
generally similar to placebo plus standard therapy. Local injection site reactions did occur more 
frequently in the belimumab 200 mg SC group (6.1%) than the placebo group (2.5%). These were all 
mild or moderate in severity with no severe or serious local injection events. No differences were 
observed between the thigh and abdominal injection sites. Two subjects in the belimumab group 
discontinued due to a local injection site reaction.  
The incidence of post-injection systemic reactions was similar between belimumab 200 mg SC and 
placebo and this is reassuring, given also the fact that no premedication was stipulated by the study 
protocol.  
The MAH is proposing that the product can be administered outside a clinically supervised setting after 
the first dose, i.e, after the first supervised injection, a patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver 
may administer Benlysta provided that the healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. 
The section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly. Based on the provided clinical study data, 
this is considered acceptable. 
In total, 3 deaths occurred in the belimumab 200 mg SC group that were associated with infections 
whereas the 2 deaths in the placebo group were associated with cardiovascular and hematologic 
complications, respectively. These infection fatalities were recently discussed in 
EMEA/H/C/002015/II/0038 and resulted in updates to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC, stating that 
infections can be severe and fatal and in case of acute infection to consider interrupting 
immunosuppressant therapy including belimumab until the infection is resolved. The MAH also agreed 
to submit a renewed cumulative review of fatal infection events within the next PSUR. It is considered 
that there is no need for further SmPC updates at this time.  
A comparative review of other AESI of interest (malignant neoplasms, psychiatric events) did not 
evoke any new concerns. Malignancy incidence rates were low and similar between the belimumab 200 
mg SC and placebo groups in Study BEL112341 and the belimumab IV studies. Similar to the previous 
IV data, the SC study results showed a slight numeric imbalance regarding incidence of events related 
to suicide/self-injury, however the numbers of cases were limited and no conclusions could be drawn. 
This issue will be further followed however as additional controlled study data is expected to be 
forthcoming, e.g. the CSR for BEL115467 (December 2019).

The reductions in immunoglobins and changes in B cell subsets by belimumab administered SC were 
similar to those seen in the IV Phase 3 program over the course of 52 weeks, supporting the overall 
expectation that the long-term safety profile of belimumab 200 mg SC will reflect that of the IV 
formulation. 
Results from the 6-month open-label extension did not evoke any new safety concerns.  
No belimumab 200 mg SC subject tested positive for ADAs in the double-blind phase of study 
BEL112341. Three subjects tested positive following belimumab 200 mg SC administration during the 
open-label phase or at the 8-Week Follow-up visit. All 3 subjects had negative values on subsequent 
follow-up testing.  
As part of the device bridging program, the usability and reliability of the autoinjector device with 
respect to chronic real-life use by adult subjects with SLE were evaluated in study 200339. An 
additional aim was to further characterize the change in belimumab trough concentrations when 
switching from the IV to the SC. The proposed switching interval of 1-4 weeks after the last 
intravenous dose is agreed.  
No medical device incidents or near incidents were identified during any belimumab SC study. No 
device functional issues were considered to have impacted safety. 
In summary, the safety profile of belimumab SC in the Phase 3 study BEL112341 was consistent with 
that of IV, and no new safety signals were identified. Similarly, the overall safety profile from the LTC 
trials to date did not evoke any new concerns. Thus, no changes to the safety specification are 
warranted except that injection related systemic reactions were added to the identified risks (in 
addition to infusion related systemic reactions). Based on sales data, cumulative post marketing 
exposure up to 08 March 2016 is estimated to be 37,081 patient years. Review of post marketing 
safety data is conducted on an ongoing basis, including the recent PSUSA (period covered:  9 March 
2015 to 8 March 2016) which concluded that the benefit/risk profile of belimumab continued to be 
positive. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety profile of belimumab 200 mg SC appears to be consistent with the known 
safety profile of the IV formulation.  
The Benefit-Risk balance is considered positive from a clinical safety point of view. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application refers to a new pharmaceutical form (SC) to be administered once weekly. The 
recommended dosage is 200 mg once weekly given as a SC injection in the abdomen or thigh. 
The proposed indication for SC belimumab is the same as that already approved for IV use of 
belimumab in the EU: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 85/92 
 
 
 
 
Belimumab is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti-dsDNA and low 
complement) despite standard therapy 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with high disease activity despite corticosteroids and standard immunosuppressants are in 
need of additional treatment options. There have been no additional medicinal products approved for 
SLE since the approval of the IV formulation of belimumab in 2011.  
The proposed SC formulation would constitute a more flexible method of receiving belimumab for the 
targeted population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH conducted a single pivotal Phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 52 week trial 
(BEL 112341) to support the SC formulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of belimumab administered SC in adult subjects with active SLE.  For the most part, the critical 
design elements of this SC study were the same as those utilized for the previous pivotal Phase 3 IV 
program. 
Subjects were randomized to belimumab or placebo (2:1 ratio) 200 mg belimumab weekly or placebo 
SC weekly. Belimumab was administered SC on Day 0 and weekly thereafter to Week 51. 
A few adaptations were made compared to the clinical program of the IV formulation, including the use 
of raised entry criteria for the SELENA SLEDAI score at screening from ≥ 6 to≥ 8. This change was 
made based on the results from the IV studies which showed that patients with higher disease activity, 
as reflected by a higher SELENA SLEDAI score, were more likely to respond to belimumab. Eligible 
subjects had also either an unequivocally positive ANA and/or positive antidouble anti-dsDNA) serum 
antibody test result and were on a stable SLE treatment regimen.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE responder index (SRI) response rate at Week 52 identical to 
the pivotal IV studies. A SRI response was defined as: ≥ 4 point reduction from baseline in SELENA 
SLEDAI score, AND no worsening (increase of <0.30 points from baseline) in Physician’s Global 
Assessment (PGA), AND no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A organ domain score 
or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores compared with baseline at the time of assessment (i.e., at 
Week 52). 
836 subjects (280 in the placebo group and 556 in the belimumab 200 mg SC group) in the ITT 
population were enrolled across 177 sites. 
The applicant also performed a phase 2 study to assess the auto-injector device for self-administration 
of belimumab outside a clinically supervised setting after the first dose.  This study demonstrated the 
feasibly of self-administration, which is reflected in the SmPC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In BEL112341, the SRI response at Week 52 was positive and statistically significant (48.4% placebo, 
61.4% belimumab, odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% CI: 1.25. 2.25; p=0.0006). The individual components 
of the SRI in BEL112341 all reached statistical significance for belimumab SC vs. placebo (all p<0.05). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/346577/2017  
Page 86/92 
 
 
 
 
 
The response was numerically superior for belimumab SC starting at Week 8. Statistical significance 
was reached by Week 16 and was maintained through Week 52. Prespecified sensitivity analyses of the 
primary endpoint were consistent with the primary analyses. 
Time to first severe flare, as measured by the modified SLE flare index (SFI), was a major secondary 
efficacy endpoint. The belimumab 200 mg SC group had a 49% reduced risk of severe flare compared 
to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74; p=0.0004). 
The second major secondary endpoint in BEL112341 was the percentage of subjects whose average 
prednisone dose was reduced by ≥ 25% from baseline to ≤ 7.5mg/day during the last 12 weeks of the 
study in the subgroup of subjects who were receiving >7.5mg/day of prednisone at baseline (60.2% of 
subjects). Subjects receiving belimumab were numerically more often able to achieve prednisone dose 
reduction than placebo subjects (18.2% vs. 11.9%; OR 1.65; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.84; p=0.0732). 
While the SC formulation represents a fixed dosing regimen (in contrast to the IV formulation which is 
dosed at mg/kg), higher body weight did not result in lower SRI response to belimumab SC. 
SRI subgroup analysis was performed using 3 definitions of high disease activity: a SELENA SLEDAI 
score of ≥ 10, low C3 and/or low C4, and the combination of anti-dsDNA positivity and low 
complement. Analysis of the major secondary endpoints was also performed for those subjects with 
both anti-dsDNA positivity and low complement. 
A more robust effect of belimumab treatment was observed in subjects with higher levels of disease 
activity. Subjects with low complement and positive anti-dsDNA demonstrated a treatment difference 
for belimumab relative to placebo of 17.41% more responders (odds ratio 2.23; 95% CI: 1.36, 3.64; 
p=0.0014) (as compared to a delta of 9.64 for the not low complement/anti-dsDNA subgroup and 
12.98 for the overall population). This subgroup also showed a more pronounced effect on prevention 
of severe flare with 62% reduced risk of severe flare compared to placebo (HR 0.38; p <0.0001) than 
the overall population (whereas the ‘not low complement/anti-dsDNA subgroup’ was not statistically 
significant). The other major secondary endpoint relating to prednisone reduction did not reach 
statistical significance ((20.7% vs. 11.4%; p=0.0844).  
In BEL112341, entry requirements for SELENA SLEDAI were slightly higher compared to the IV study 
program. However, a post-hoc analysis was conducted of this same subgroup (baseline SELENA 
SLEDAI score ≥ 8) in the IV Phase 3 trials showed results consistent with the SC trial. 
Pharmacokinetic data has shown that the median concentrations at steady state after SC 
administration of 200 mg weekly was close to steady state Cav after administration of 10 mg/kg every 
4 weeks in the IV program. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Overall, the results from study BEL112341 are quite consistent with the efficacy demonstrated in the 
IV Phase 3 registration program (studies C1056 and C1057). 
Evaluation of the long-term efficacy of belimumab continues in one ongoing IV extension studies 
(HGS1006-C1074) for subjects who satisfactorily completed the Phase 3 controlled repeat-dose IV 
studies. There are several ongoing post-marketing studies of belimumab in SLE populations not 
previously evaluated. In particular, studies are on-going in pregnancy, in the elderly population were 
clinical data are lacking. In addition, there is a lack of data in SLE patients with severe active lupus 
nephritis or severe active CNS lupus, this is being investigated. Finally the lack of data on effect of 
stopping treatment and risk of rebound phenomenon has not yet been addressed. These studies have 
Assessment report

Page 87/92 
 
 
 
 
been agreed as part of the IV formulation and  are ongoing. However they are also relevant to this new 
formulation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal study BEL112341, the AE profile of belimumab 200 mg SC plus standard therapy was 
generally similar to placebo plus standard therapy. Local injection site reactions did occur more 
frequently in the belimumab 200 mg SC group (6.1%) than the placebo group (2.5%). These were all 
mild or moderate in severity with no severe or serious local injection events. No differences were 
observed between the thigh and abdominal injection sites.  
Mild to moderate local injection site reactions occurred more frequently in the belimumab 200 mg SC 
group (6.1%) than the placebo group (2.5%) and 2 subjects in the belimumab group discontinued due 
to a local injection site reaction. 
The incidence of post-injection systemic reactions was similar between belimumab 200 mg SC and 
placebo.  
In total, 3 deaths occurred in the belimumab 200 mg SC group that were associated with infections 
whereas the 2 deaths in the placebo group were associated with cardiovascular and hematologic 
complications, respectively. Similarly to the IV formulation, infections can be severe and fatal and in 
case of acute infection to consider interrupting immunosuppressant therapy including belimumab until 
the infection is resolved. No new safety concern was raised with this formulation. Additionally a 
comparative review of other AESI of interest (malignant neoplasms, psychiatric events) did not raise 
any new concerns. 
In summary, the safety profile of belimumab SC in the Phase 3 study BEL112341 was consistent with 
that of the IV formulation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The Company is proposing that the product be self-administered outside a clinically supervised setting 
after the first dose. This is acceptable and this will be monitored through pharmacovigilance in the post 
marketing setting in PSURs.  
Following the approval of the IV formulation, the long-term safety of belimumab is still being 
investigated in several ongoing postmarketing studies and a 5-year prospective observational registry 
(BEL116543/SABLE) is in place.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results from the belimumab SC Phase 3 trial, BEL112341 using belimumab 200 mg SC once 
weekly as an add-on treatment to standard therapy in adult patients with active autoantibody-positive 
SLE are consistent with the efficacy demonstrated in the previous Phase 3 registration program for the 
IV Benlysta formulation. Similar to the IV studies, a more robust effect of belimumab treatment was 
observed in subjects with higher levels of disease activity. This support the use of belimumab SC for 
the same indication as currently approved for the IV formulation, i.e. as add-on therapy in adult 
patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE with a high degree of disease activity (e.g positive anti-
dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy. Patients with high disease activity despite 
standard care are also those with the greatest unmet medical need.  
A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of belimumab for weekly, fixed-dose administration constitute a more 
flexible method of receiving belimumab for these patients, thereby avoiding infusion therapy. 
Additionally, self-administration by patients or caregivers (after the first supervised dose) would also 
be advantageous. 
The local injection site reactions observed are acceptable and the incidence of post-injection systemic 
reactions was similar between belimumab 200 mg SC and placebo.  
The safety profile of belimumab is based on the SC Phase 3 trial BEL112341, supported by and 
consistent with, a large safety database from the IV formulation. Effects on B cell subsets and 
immunoglobin levels by belimumab administered SC reflected those observed in the IV Phase 3 
program. Thus, overall, a similar long-term safety profile is anticipated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data provided in this application are considered acceptable  to support the approval of belimumab 
SC formulation as an add-on therapy on top of standard of care for patients with autoantibody positive 
SLE with high disease activity. 
A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of belimumab constitute a more flexible method of administration for 
the patients, thereby avoiding infusion therapy. Additionally, self-administration by patients or 
caregivers (after the first supervised dose) would also be advantageous in the daily practice. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Benlysta is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Benlysta 200mg, solution for injection in syringes and syringes in 
prefilled pen is favourable in the following indication: 
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti dsDNA and low 
complement) despite standard therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Benlysta subject

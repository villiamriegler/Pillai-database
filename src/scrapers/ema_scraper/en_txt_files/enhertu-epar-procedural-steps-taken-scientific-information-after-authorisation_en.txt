specifically patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times 
ULN, irrespective of AST level. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The final report for non-imposed non-interventional PASS 
imposed non-interventional PASS ‘EU survey of 
relevant healthcare professionals on understanding 
of key risk minimisations measures pertaining to 
ILD/pneumonitis’ in order to fulfil MEA 003.2, a 
category 3 study listed in the RMP. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
‘EU survey of relevant healthcare professionals on 
understanding of key risk minimisations measures 
pertaining to ILD/pneumonitis’ in order to fulfil MEA 003.2, 
a category 3 study listed in the RMP was submitted as part 
of this variation application. The primary objective of the 
study was to assess physicians' awareness, knowledge, and 
implementation of risk minimization measures related to 
the risk, early detection, diagnosis, and management of 
ILD/pneumonitis. The primary outcome of the risk 
minimization measures was evaluated as effective if all the 
following success criteria were met: the proportion of 
physicians being aware of the risk of ILD/pneumonitis was 
80% or greater, the proportion of physicians 
Page 2/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
knowledgeable about the risk of ILD/pneumonitis was 60% 
or greater, and the proportion of physicians answering the 
implementation questions correctly was 75% or greater. 
Overall, the study was well conducted, but the primary 
outcome regarding risk minimization measures 
effectiveness was not met. Nevertheless, the MAH did 
provide satisfactory justification as to why this was not 
achieved, mainly in the knowledge domain. Overall, the risk 
of ILD/pneumonitis should remain as an imported identified 
risk as well as the applicable additional risk minimization 
measures (HCP Guide and Patient Card) in the RMP for 
Enhertu.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
IXIARO is indicated for active immunisation against Japanese encephalitis in adults, adolescents, children 
and infants aged 2 months and older. 
IXIARO should be considered for use in individuals at risk of exposure through travel or in the course of 
their occupation. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults (18 to  ≤ 65 years of age) 
The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each, according to the following 
conventional schedule: 
First dose at Day 0. 
Second dose: 28 days after first dose. 
Rapid schedule  
Persons aged 18 to ≤ 65 years can be vaccinated in a rapid schedule as follows: 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First dose at Day 0. 
Second dose: 7 days after first dose.  
With both schedules, primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential 
exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (see section 4.4). 
It is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose 
vaccination course with IXIARO. 
If the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might not 
be achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high 
seroconversion rates (see section 5.1). 
Booster dose  
A booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary 
immunization, prior to potential re-exposure to JEV.  
Persons at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (laboratory personnel or persons residing in 
endemic areas) should receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immunization (see section 5.1).  
Long-term seroprotection data following a first booster dose administered 12 - 24 months after primary 
immunization suggest that a second booster should be given 10 years after the first booster dose, prior to 
potential exposure to JEV.  
Elderly (>65 years of age) 
The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each, according to the following 
conventional schedule: 
First dose at Day 0. 
Second dose: 28 days after first dose. 
The primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV) (see section 4.4). 
It is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose 
vaccination course with IXIARO. 
If the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might not 
be achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high 
seroconversion rates (see section 5.1). 
Booster dose 
As with many vaccines, the immune response in elderly persons to IXIARO is lower than in younger adults. 
Duration of protection is uncertain in elderly persons, therefore a booster dose (third dose) should be 
considered before any further exposure to JE virus. Long-term seroprotection following a booster-dose is not 
known. 
Paediatric Population 
Children and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age 
The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml according to the following schedule: 
First dose at Day 0. 
Second dose: 28 days after first dose. 
Children from 2 months to < 3 years of age 
The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.25 ml according to the following 
schedule: 
First dose at Day 0. 
Second dose: 28 days after first dose.

See section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. 
It is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose 
vaccination course with IXIARO. 
Booster dose (Children and adolescents) 
A booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary 
immunization, prior to potential re-exposure to JEV. 
Children and adolescents at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (residing in endemic areas) 
should receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immunization (see section 5.1). 
Children and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age should receive a single 0.5 ml booster dose. 
Children from 14 months to < 3 years of age should receive a single 0.25 ml booster dose.  
See section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. 
No long-term seroprotection data beyond two years after a first booster administered 1 year after primary 
immunization has been generated in children.  
Children below 2 months of age 
The safety and efficacy of IXIARO in children younger than 2 months has not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration  
The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. In infants, the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh may be used as injection site. IXIARO should never be injected 
intravascularly. 
When IXIARO is administered concomitantly with injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate 
syringes at opposite sites. 
Exceptionally, IXIARO can also be administered subcutaneously to patients with thrombocytopenia or 
bleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration. Subcutaneous 
administration could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine (see section 4.4). However, it should be 
noted that there are no clinical efficacy data to support administration by the subcutaneous route. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to the residues 
protamine sulphate, formaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, host cell DNA, sodium metabisulphite (see 
section 2.), host cell protein. 
Individuals who show hypersensitivity reactions after receiving the first dose of the vaccine should not be 
given the second dose. 
Administration must be postponed in persons with acute severe febrile conditions. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be available to 
treat rare cases of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. 
Under no circumstances should IXIARO be administered intravascularly. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. 
IXIARO will not protect against encephalitis caused by other micro-organisms. 
Like other intramuscular injections, this vaccine should not be administered intramuscularly to persons with 
thrombocytopenia, haemophilia or other bleeding disorders (see section 4.2). 
In adults a seroconversion rate of 29.4 % has been observed 10 days after the first i.m. vaccination, and 97.3 
% one week after the second i.m. vaccination in the conventional schedule. After immunisation with the 
rapid schedule a seroconversion rate of 99% has been observed 7 days after the second i.m. vaccination. 
Hence, primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV). 
Protection against Japanese Encephalitis is not ensured until the second dose has been received. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant administration of IXIARO with other vaccines: 
Concomitant administration of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and with inactivated rabies 
vaccine in two different schedules has been evaluated in clinical studies. There was no interference with the 
immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) or to hepatitis A or rabies virus vaccines (see section 
5.1). 
The safety profiles of IXIARO and the other studied vaccines were not compromised when administered 
concomitantly. 
In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency an adequate immune 
response may not be obtained. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant women. 
In animal studies findings of unclear clinical relevance have been identified (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy should be avoided. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether IXIARO is excreted in human milk. 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding 
woman to IXIARO is negligible. However, in the absence of data and as a precautionary measure the use of 
IXIARO during lactation should be avoided. 
Fertility 
A study in rats did not indicate vaccine-related effects on female reproduction, foetal weight, survival and 
development of the off-spring. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Ixiaro was assessed in controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in 5,021 healthy adults (from 
non-endemic countries) and 1,559 children and adolescents (mostly from endemic countries). 
Approximately 40% of treated subjects experienced systemic adverse reactions and approximately 54% 
experienced injection site reactions. They usually occur within the first three days after vaccination, are 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
usually mild and resolve within a few days. No increase in the number of adverse reactions was noted 
between first and second doses or following a booster dose in adults.  
Most commonly reported adverse reactions in adults included headache (20% of subjects), myalgia (13%), 
injection site pain (33%), injection site tenderness (33%) and fatigue (12.9%). 
Most commonly reported adverse reactions in children and adolescents included pyrexia, diarrhoea,  
influenza like illness, irritability, injection site pain, injection site tenderness, and injection site redness (see

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No symptoms related to overdose were reported. 
Paediatric population: 
No case of overdose has been reported in the paediatric population. Inadvertent administration of an 0.5 ml 
dose of IXIARO in children aged 1 to <3 years does not pose any safety concerns (section 5.1.).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, Encephalitis vaccines. ATC code: J07BA02 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines is not well understood. Studies in animals 
have shown that the vaccine triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against Japanese encephalitis 
virus that are most often protective. Challenge studies were performed in mice that were treated with human 
IXIARO antisera. These studies showed that almost all mice that had a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 
titre of at least 1:10 were protected from a lethal Japanese encephalitis virus challenge. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
No prospective efficacy trials have been performed. Immunogenicity of IXIARO was studied in 
approximately 3,119 healthy adult subjects included in seven randomized, controlled and five uncontrolled 
Phase 3 trials and in approximately 550 healthy children included in two randomized, controlled and two 
uncontrolled Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Pivotal immunogenicity trial (adults) 
Immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, active controlled, observer blinded, 
multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial including 867 healthy male and female subjects given IXIARO or the US 
licensed JEV vaccine JE VAX (on a 0, 7 and 28 day schedule by subcutaneous injection). The co-primary 
endpoint was seroconversion rate (anti JEV antibody titer ≥1:10) and geometric mean titers (GMT) at Day 56 
as assessed by a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) for the entire study population. 
By Day 56, the proportion of subjects who had seroconverted was similar for both treatment groups (96.4% 
vs. 93.8% for IXIARO and JE VAX, respectively). GMT increased by Day 56 to 243.6 for IXIARO and to 
102.0 for JE VAX, respectively. The immune responses elicited by IXIARO were non inferior to those 
induced by JE VAX (Table 2).

The effect of age on the immune response to IXIARO and JE-VAX was assessed as a secondary endpoint in 
this active controlled study, comparing subjects aged ≥ 50 years of age (N=262, mean age 59.8) with those 
below 50 years of age (N=605, mean age 33.9). 
There was no significant difference between seroconversion rates of IXIARO and JE-VAX in subjects aged 
<50 years compared to those aged ≥50 years at Day 28 or Day 56 following vaccination. Geometric mean 
titers were significantly higher at Day 28 in subjects aged <50 years than those aged ≥50 years in the JE 
VAX group (80.9 vs. 45.9, p=0.0236) but there was no significant difference at Day 56 for this treatment 
group. There were no significant effects of age on geometric mean titer in the group receiving IXIARO. 
There was no significant difference between seroconversion rates in subjects aged <50 years compared to 
those aged ≥50 years at Day 28 or Day 56 for either treatment group. 
Antibody persistence (adults)  
Antibody persistence was evaluated in an uncontrolled Phase 3 follow up clinical trial, enrolling subjects 
who had completed two pivotal studies, and who received at least one dose of IXIARO. Long term 
immunogenicity of IXIARO was assessed in a subset of 181 subjects up to month 24 (Intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population) and in 152 subjects up to month 36 after the first IXIARO vaccination. 
Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and GMTs at Months 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36 are summarized in Table 3 for 
the ITT population.

The observed decline in GMT is as expected and compares well with data from other inactivated JE 
vaccines. 
In another open-label, follow-up Phase 3 study, the persistence of antibodies up to 24 months after primary 
vaccination was assessed. A total of 116 subjects who had received the recommended primary schedule of 
IXIARO were included in this follow-up study. Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 were 82.8% (95% CI: 
74.9, 88.6, N=116) at Month 6 and 58.3% at Month 12 (95% CI: 49.1, 66.9, N=115). At Month 24, 48.3% 
(95% CI: 39.4, 57.3, N=116) of subjects who completed the recommended primary immunization still had 
PRNT50 titers of ≥1:10. GMT in these subjects was 16.2 (95% CI: 13.8, 19.0) at Month 24.  
Booster immunisation (adults) 
In an uncontrolled, open-label phase 3 study a single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose of IXIARO was given at 
month 15 after primary immunization. All of the 198 subjects treated were included in the ITT and Safety 
Populations. 
Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and GMT over time are summarised in table 4:

Antibody persistence after booster immunisation (adults) 
In an uncontrolled, open-label extension to the booster study described above, 67 subjects were followed up 
for determination of JEV neutralizing antibody titres at approximately 6 years after a booster dose. 96% of 
subjects (64/67) still had protective antibody levels (PRNT50≥1:10), with a GMT of 148 (95%CI: 107; 207).  
Mathematical modelling was applied to project the average duration of protection. Based on this model, it is 
estimated that average duration of protection will be 14 years and 75% of vaccinees will retain protective 
antibody levels (PRNT50≥1:10) for 10 years. A second booster should therefore be given 10 years after the 
first booster dose, administered 1 year after the primary immunization, prior to potential exposure to JEV.  
Rapid immunisation schedule (adults) 
The immunogenicity of IXIARO administered in a rapid vaccination schedule was evaluated in a 
randomized, observer-blind, phase 3 study. A total of 217 subjects aged 18 to  ≤ 65 years received IXIARO 
together with inactivated rabies vaccine (Rabipur) in a rapid immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 7 and 
56 subjects received IXIARO alone in the conventional immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 28. The 
proportion of subjects that seroconverted by 7 and by 28 days after the last immunisation was similar for 
both schedules. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers also remained comparably high up to 12 months 
after the first immunisation in both schedules (Table 5). 
The rapid schedule was tested for concomitant administration of IXIARO and Rabipur but it can also be used 
for administration of IXIARO alone, as no immune interference of the two vaccines has been observed (see 
section 4.5).

Incomplete primary immunization (adults) 
The immunogenicity of booster doses was also assessed in the study investigating persistence of immunity 
following different primary immunization regimens (2x6 mcg: N=116, 1x12mcg: N=116 or 1x6 mcg: 
N=117). A single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose was administered at 11 or 23 months after the first dose to 
subjects, which were determined to be seronegative (PRNT50 titers < 1:10) at month 6 and/or month 12 after 
the primary immunization. Results indicate that the second injection of the primary immunization series can 
be given up to 11 months after the first dose. The immune responses to further doses at different time points 
after complete or incomplete primary immunization are shown in table 6.

Concomitant use (adults) 
Concomitant administration of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (HAVRIX 1440) 
The concomitant use of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (HAVRIX 1440) has 
been explored in one clinical trial. There was no interference with the immune response to the JE virus and 
HAV, respectively. Concomitant administration of IXIARO and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine was shown 
to be non-inferior to single vaccinations with regard to GMT of anti-JE virus neutralizing antibody and HAV 
antibody, and for seroconversion rates of both antibody types (Table 7).

Concomitant administration of IXIARO with inactivated rabies vaccine (Rabipur): 
In an observer-blind Phase 3 study, concomitant administration of IXIARO and Rabipur has been studied in 
adults aged 18 to  ≤ 65 years of age in comparison to respective single vaccinations in conventional schedule. 
No interference was observed with regards to geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rates for anti 
JEV neutralizing antibodies (Table 8). There was also no interference with the immune response to Rabipur.

Immunogenicity in elderly persons (>65 years) 
The immunogenicity of IXIARO was evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled trial in 200 healthy elderly 
persons aged >65 to 83 years, including subjects with stable underlying conditions like 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. JEV 
neutralizing antibodies were determined 42 days after the second dose of the primary series (Day 70). 
Elderly persons have a lower immune response to vaccination compared to younger adults or children, in 
terms of seroconversion rates (percentage of subjects with PRNT50 titer ≥1:10) and geometric mean titers 
(Table 9).

In a phase 2 study in healthy Indian toddlers aged ≥1 year to <3 years, 24 children were vaccinated with 0.25 
ml of IXIARO (the licensed dose for this age group) and 24 children received the adult 0.5 ml dose. Data are 
limited but there were no differences in the safety profile between the 0.25 ml and the 0.5 ml dose in this age 
group. 
Immunogenicity and safety of IXIARO in children and adolescents from a JEV-endemic country 
The safety and immunogenicity of IXIARO were evaluated in a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical 
trial conducted in the Philippines, where JEV is endemic. The safety profile of IXIARO was compared to 
control vaccines Havrix (Hepatitis A vaccine, paediatric 720 EL.U./0.5 mL formulation) and Prevenar 
(Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 protein]). The immunogenicity evaluation 
was performed in a subset of the study population and included the determination of the seroconversion rate 
(SCR), defined as JEV neutralizing antibody titer ≥1:10, the proportion of subjects achieving an at least four-
fold increase in antibody titers and the geometric mean titer (GMT) at Day 56 and Month 7, by dose and by 
age group. The immune responses elicited by IXIARO are presented in Table 10.

Safety and tolerability was evaluated in the entire study population. Parents or subjects recorded adverse 
events on a diary card for the first seven days after each vaccination. Parents or subjects were asked for any 
unsolicited AEs on the day of the second vaccination and at in-person visits including a medical exam 28 
days (Day 56) and 6 months (Month 7) after the second dose. The safety profile of IXIARO was comparable 
to that of Havrix or Prevenar.  
Antibody persistence and booster dose in children and adolescents from a JEV-endemic country 
The persistence of JEV neutralizing antibodies after primary immunisation and safety and immunogenicity 
of an IXIARO booster dose 12 months after primary immunization were evaluated in a randomized, 
controlled, open-label clinical trial conducted in the Philippines, where JEV is endemic (300 children, mean 
age 5.3 years, range 1.2 - 17.3 years). 150 children were followed-up for three years without booster, 
additional 150 children received a booster after 1 year (0.25 ml if aged <3 years at time of the booster, 0.5 ml 
if aged 3 years and above) and were followed-up for further two years. Seroprotection rate (SPR) defined as 
neutralizing antibody titer ≥1:10 and geometric mean titers (GMT) are presented in Table 11. The booster 
dose led to a pronounced increase in GMTs and seroprotection rate remained at 100% two years after the 
booster.

Immunogenicity and safety in children and adolescents from non-endemic countries   
The  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  IXIARO  was  evaluated  in  an  uncontrolled,  open-label  clinical  trial 
conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia in healthy male and female subjects with planned travel 
to JEV-endemic areas. Children and adolescents aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years received two vaccine doses of 0.5ml 
and children aged  ≥ 2 months to < 3 years received two vaccine doses of 0.25ml on Day 0 and Day 28 by 
intramuscular  injection.  Immunogenicity  data  were  evaluated  in  64  subjects.  The  SCRs  and  GMTs  are

Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical toxicity data are limited. 
In a reproductive and pre-/post-natal toxicity study, no vaccine-related effects were detected on reproduction, 
foetal weight, survival and development of the off-spring. However, incomplete ossification of parts of the 
skeleton was observed in the group receiving 2 doses, but not in the group receiving 3 doses. It is currently 
difficult to explain if this phenomenon is treatment related or not.

6. Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What IXIARO is and what it is used for 
IXIARO is a vaccine against the Japanese encephalitis virus. 
The vaccine causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against this disease. 
IXIARO is used to prevent infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This virus is mainly found 
in Asia and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected animal (like pigs). Many 
infected people develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, JE 
usually starts as a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, tiredness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Confusion 
and agitation also occur in the early stage of disease. 
IXIARO should be given only to adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 2 months and older travelling 
to countries, where JE is endemic or who are at risk through work. 
2.  What you need to know before you and/or your child receive IXIARO  
Do not use IXIARO: 
• 
If you and/or your child are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you and/or your child have developed an allergic reaction after receiving a former dose of 
IXIARO. Signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of 
the face and tongue. 
If you and/or your child are ill with a high fever. In this case, your doctor will postpone the 
vaccination. 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
IXIARO must not be injected into a blood vessel. 
Primary immunization should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to JEV. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you and/or your child have experienced any health problems after previous administration of any 
vaccine. 
If you and/or your child have any other known allergies. 
If you and/or your child have a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal) 
or a reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia). 
If your child is younger than 2 months of age, since IXIARO has not been tested in infants younger 
than 2 months of age. 
If your or your child’s immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you and/or 
your child are taking medicines affecting your immune system (such as a medicine called cortisone 
or cancer medicine). 
Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks and benefits of receiving IXIARO. 
Please note that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
IXIARO cannot cause the disease it protects against. 
IXIARO will not prevent infections caused by other viruses than the Japanese encephalitis virus. 
As with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. 
You should take appropriate precautions for you and your child to reduce mosquito bites (adequate 
clothing, use of repellents, mosquito nets) even after receiving IXIARO. 
Other medicines and IXIARO 
Studies in humans to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medicines (clinical trials) have shown that 
IXIARO can be given at the same time with hepatitis A vaccine and rabies vaccine. 
Tell your doctor if you and/or your child are taking or have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility 
There are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant or breast-feeding women. 
As a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy or breast-feeding should be avoided. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before receiving this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
IXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
IXIARO contains potassium and sodium  
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’ and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. This product might contain traces of residual sodium metabisulfite which is below detection 
limit.

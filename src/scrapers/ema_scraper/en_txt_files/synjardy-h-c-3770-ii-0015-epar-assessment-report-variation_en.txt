2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease. Recent estimates suggest that the number of 
people worldwide with diabetes is currently 382 million and is expected to reach at least 592 million within 
the next 25 years. The most common form is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by 
insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production by the liver.  
Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with comorbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk, such 
as obesity and hypertension. The risk of CV disease is increased approximately 2 to 4-fold in adults with 
diabetes. The risk of heart failure is increased more than 2-fold in patients with T2DM, and heart failure 
in these patients is associated with a poor prognosis. Recommended strategies for reducing CV risk in 
patients with T2DM include glucose management, lipid lowering, blood pressure (BP) control, smoking 
cessation, and weight loss. There is a clear association between microvascular complications such as 
albuminuria and an increased risk of CV events in patients with T2DM, and improved glycaemic control 
has been associated with a reduction in microvascular events. However, the impact of reducing blood 
glucose and the potential benefit of specific glucose-lowering agents on CV events in patients with T2DM 
remains unclear and highly controversial. Thus, there is a strong clinical need to identify 
antihyperglycaemic agents that are safe and can potentially reduce cardiovascular and microvascular 
complications. 
Empagliflozin is a novel, orally administered, potent, and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor developed by 
Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). Empagliflozin is currently indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
in conjunction with diet and exercise, as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to other oral antidiabetic 
treatments or insulin. Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily is approved in more than 50 countries 
including the EU and the US. 
Metformin has been available for over 50 years and, together with lifestyle modification, is recommended 
by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes as the first-line 
therapy for type 2 diabetes. Metformin lowers blood glucose levels primarily by suppressing hepatic 
gluconeogenesis. Metformin also improves insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues and decreases 
gastrointestinal tract glucose absorption without exerting any direct effect on pancreatic β-cell insulin 
secretion. Through these mechanisms, metformin therapy typically leads to substantial improvements in 
glycaemic control but it does not promote weight gain or increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Synjardy is a twice-daily fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and immediate-release metformin that 
is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Synjardy was approved in the EU and the US in 2015, and has been submitted for 
approval in numerous other countries worldwide. 
In this application, the proposed new indications are to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by reducing 
CV deaths and to reduce the risk of CV death or hospitalisation for heart failure, in patients with T2DM and 
high CV risk. The proposed indications are based on the results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (trial 
1245.25). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

Page 7/57 
 
 
 
  
 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided a justification for not submitting an environmental assessment update.   
As the target population and the maximum daily dose are not changed as a result of this variation, the 
CHMP agrees that the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of empagliflozin / metformin. Empagliflozin/ metformin is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In this dossier, (only) the results of the cardiovascular outcome trial are presented. In this outcome trial, 
limited PK data were collected. The design of the trial is discussed below under clinical efficacy. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Limited pharmacokinetic data were collected during the EmpaReg trial. No changes to the product 
documentation are proposed.  
Steady-state morning trough concentrations of empagliflozin were evaluated on Days 85 and 364. In this 
study patients were treated with Empagliflozin 10mg or 25mg once daily. Empagliflozin trough 
concentrations were similar within each dose group at both time points indicating that steady-state 
concentrations of empagliflozin were maintained during the course of the trial. The increase in 
empagliflozin exposure with dose was roughly proportional to dose. 
Empagliflozin exposures were generally similar in men and women at both dose levels. There were no 
relevant changes in empagliflozin exposure with an increase in gender, age or body weight. No specific 
trends were observed by geographic region or country. There were no major differences in exposure in 
different races or ethnicities. Empagliflozin exposure increased with a decrease in renal function. These 
findings are consistent with the results of the previous population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
In subjects with renal insufficiency, dose-normalised geometric mean plasma trough concentrations are 
increased up to 2.8 fold in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with a normal 
renal function (Figure 1). These results are in line with the previously observed higher AUCss of 
empagliflozin in patients with renal impairment as reflected in the current SmPC.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacodynamic data were submitted. For results regarding HbA1c and FPG, please refer to 
the section on Further Efficacy endpoints (see section 2.4.1). 
Mechanism of action 
The current SmPC contains information about the regulation of glucose by empagliflozin. However, the 
proposed CV prevention indication likely has another mode of action that is not directly related to 
glycaemic control. This is even more relevant in subjects with renal insufficiency, where the effect on 
glycaemic control was limited but the effect for CV prevention is preserved. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
In this application, a single trial is submitted (EMPA-REG, 1245.25). This trial is discussed below and 
summarised in Table 15 Summary of Efficacy for trial EMPA-REG. 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
A Phase III, multicentre, international, randomised, parallel group, double blind cardiovascular safety 
study of BI 10773 (10 mg and 25 mg administered orally once daily) compared to usual care in type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients with increased cardiovascular risk. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/19502/2017 
Page 9/57 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study was performed in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk who had insufficient 
glycaemic control despite diet and exercise and were either treatment-naïve (drug-naïve) or receiving 
any antidiabetic background therapy.  
The inclusion criteria specify a population at high risk for CV events, specified by the combination of T2DM 
and a history of CV disease, defined as at least one of the following:  
• 
• 
confirmed history of myocardial infarction (MI) (>2 months prior to informed consent);  
evidence of coronary artery disease (in ≥2 major coronary arteries or single vessel coronary 
artery disease (significant stenosis with positive non-invasive stress test or with previous 
hospitalisation for unstable angina); last episode of unstable angina >2 months prior to informed 
consent);  
•  history of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (>2 months prior to informed consent);  
•  presence of peripheral artery disease (symptomatic or not).  
Patients could only be included if glycaemic control was insufficient (HbA1c 7-9% for treatment-naïve 
patients, 7-10% for patients already on glucose-lowering therapy) . 
Contrary to the current SmPC of Synjardy, subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 30 
and 60 ml/min 1.73m2) were fully eligible for all treatments. 
In this document, the effect of empagliflozin vs. placebo as add-on to standard of care is compared (also) 
between the subgroup of patients taking metformin at baseline and the entire study population. This 
approach was chosen to check for consistency of the results in patients on a metformin background with 
the results of the entire trial population. All patients who received metformin background treatment at 
baseline were included irrespective of the metformin dose and any changes thereof after baseline. 
The individual empagliflozin doses showed similar effects in the entire trial population and in the subgroup 
of patients receiving metformin at baseline; results for the individual dose groups are not discussed here. 
However, such results are shown in the AR of Jardiance for the entire trial population.  
Treatments 
Empagliflozin was administered in 10 mg or 25 mg doses once daily and compared to placebo. The study 
dose is in line with the current SmPC of Synjardy. Empagliflozin was administered once daily, whereas in 
Synjardy it is administered twice daily. This was addressed in the original MAA of Synjardy and found of 
no clinical relevance. 
All patients received trial medication on top of standard-of-care treatment, which could be adapted if 
indicated. Background antidiabetic medication was to be kept stable in the first 12 weeks but could be 
changed thereafter to achieve standard of care according to investigator’s discretion and local guidelines. 
Metformin could be included in this background medication, thus enabling this discussion for Synjardy.  
Of note, the trial included also patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2) for 
whom Synjardy is currently not authorized. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this event-driven study was to determine non-inferiority (with a non-inferiority 
margin of 1.3) and subsequently superiority of empagliflozin treatment (2 pooled doses, 10 mg once daily 
and 25 mg once daily) vs. placebo based on the composite of 3 major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal MI in patients with T2DM and increased 
cardiovascular risk. The procedure guaranteed control of the type 1 error.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 3-point MACE (major adverse cardiovascular 
events; composite of any of the following: cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction). The key secondary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 4-point MACE (cardiovascular 
death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalisation for unstable angina 
pectoris). These events were prospectively adjudicated using pre-specified definitions by an independent 
clinical events committee (CEC), blinded to treatment allocation.  
In addition, around 40 other secondary and further endpoints were analysed. 
Sample size 
The primary hypothesis originally aimed to assess the non-inferiority of empagliflozin versus placebo 
based on a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the hazard ratio but later this was amended (see below) to a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 1.3 and 90% 
power, with a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided), with the empagliflozin and placebo patients in 2:1 
ratio, a minimum of 691 events were required to achieve the primary aim of the trial (using a 
Haybittle-Peto boundary that preserved 0.0249 of the alpha for the final analysis). The trial would 
continue until a minimum of 691 patients had experienced an adjudicated primary outcome event. 
While the number of required events was independent of the accrual and follow-up time and independent 
of the yearly event rates, the number of patients to be randomised was dependent on these parameters. 
To obtain the minimum 691 events, based on 7000 patients, assuming an accrual period of 24 months, a 
yearly event rate of 1.5%, and a randomisation rate of 3500 patients/year, the trial duration was 
anticipated to be just under 8 years. The planned treatment duration of the patients was therefore up to 
8 years, with approximately 8 years (approximately 420 weeks) as the planned total duration of trial. 
With a minimum of 691 events, the trial would have at least 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.785 
(corresponding to a 21.5% risk reduction in cardiovascular outcome events) for the primary endpoint. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 25 
mg; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (<8.5 or ≥8.5% 
at screening), BMI (<30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, Latin 
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; 
mild impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2; moderate impairment: eGFR 30 to ≤59 
mL/min/1.73m2).  
Blinding (masking) 
The placebo run-in period of this trial was performed open-label, i.e. both the investigator and the patient 
knew that the patient received placebo during the run-in period. The randomised period of this trial was 
performed double-blind according to current standards. The interim analysis was performed by a 
separate team. 
Statistical methods 
For confirmatory testing, the hazard ratio (HR) of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg combined; designated 
as “all empagliflozin” in the document) to placebo was to be analysed with a Cox proportional hazards 
regression model. Non-inferiority on the primary endpoint was to be tested based on the non-inferiority 
margin of 1.3 and the overall significance level of alpha=0.025 (1-sided). If non-inferiority for the primary 
endpoint could be established for the 1.3 margin, non-inferiority would be tested for the key secondary 
endpoint based on the same margin. If non-inferiority was established for both endpoints, superiority was 
to be tested for the primary endpoint and then the key secondary endpoint. The significance level of the 
final analysis was slightly adapted due to an interim analysis of the trial data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/19502/2017 
Page 11/57 
 
 
 
  
 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested for non-inferiority and superiority using a 4-step 
hierarchical testing strategy, which will protect the overall type I error. The non-inferiority margin was set 
at 1.3.  
A number of additional secondary and further endpoints related to CV safety and microvascular safety 
were analysed in an exploratory manner, based on adjudicated events, reported adverse events, or 
laboratory data. These included the components of the composite CV and microvascular endpoints as 
individual endpoints, as well as a composite of heart failure requiring hospitalisation or CV death, 
all-cause mortality, and a composite of new or worsening nephropathy. 
The main analysis for each endpoint followed the “intent-to-treat (ITT)” principle, using the treated set 
(TS) and including all events up to individual trial completion. In addition, on-treatment analyses for CV 
endpoints based on the “treatment-emergent” principle were performed using the on-treatment set (OS, 
included only patients with at least 30 days of cumulative treatment and considered only events up to 30 
days after treatment stop). Furthermore, analyses using the TS with various lengths of follow-up time 
(such as 7 or 30 days) after treatment stop were performed for CV endpoints (see Figure 2 below). 
Figure 2 Illustration of the analyses based on the TS and OS 
The primary analysis will be on the ITT population and performed with a Cox proportional hazards model, 
stratified by age, sex, baseline categories of BMI, baseline HbA1c, baseline eGFR values and geographical 
region, performed on the ITT population. This is considered standard for time to event endpoints. For 
sensitivity analyses, the primary endpoint was further tested in the on-treatment set and the per-protocol 
set. Secondary and exploratory time-to-event endpoints used the same analysis model as the primary 
endpoint. UACR and eGFR were analysed with the mixed model repeated measures approach (MMRM), 
using the observed data. Other categorical endpoints were analysed using an ANCOVA model with LOCF. 
An interim analysis was performed in 2012 to provide data for a cardiovascular meta-analysis submitted 
in the initial marketing application. The overall type I error rate was maintained at a one-sided 
significance level of 0.025 using a Haybittle-Peto correction, resulting in α=0.0001 for the interim analysis 
and 0.0249 for the final analysis, to protect the overall type I error at 0.025 one-sided.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 7020 patients treated with randomised trial medication, 97.0% of the patients completed the trial. 
Vital status information at the end of the trial was available for all but 53 patients (0.8%). Disposition in 
terms of trial completion and the availability of vital status was balanced across the 3 treatment groups

(Table 1). The proportions of patients who prematurely discontinued trial medication were higher in the 
placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups; the most frequent reasons were adverse events 
(placebo: 13.0%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 11.4%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.7%).

Recruitment 
This trial was a multi-centre trial conducted globally. A total of 11 531 patients signed informed consent, 
i.e. were screened or enrolled, at 609 centres in 42 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Latin 
America and Australia/New Zealand (the last 2 countries were grouped with North America for the 
purpose of the analyses). The first patient was enrolled into this trial on 26 Aug 2010. The last on-site visit 
of a patient took place on 13 Apr 2015. The last contact date with any patient in the trial was 21 Apr 2015.  
The majority of randomised patients came from Europe (41.1%) and North America (19.8%).  
Conduct of the study 
This trial was conducted according to the original trial protocol dated 10 May 2010 and its revisions. There 
were 4 global protocol amendments leading to 4 global protocol revisions (dated 22 Sep 2010, 22 Apr 
2011, 29 Dec 2011, 15 Oct 2013).  
With amendment nr 3, prior to the interim analysis, the non-inferiority margin was reduced from 1.8 to 
1.3 and the sample size increased accordingly from 4000 to 7000 patients to meet regulatory 
requirements. The required number of events increased from 137 to 691. The anticipated treatment 
duration of the patients was changed from 3-4 years to 6-8 years.  
Also with amendment nr 3, the primary endpoint was reworded to make it clear that silent MI was not 
included in the definition (time to the first occurrence of MACE-3). 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the 3 treatment groups. For 
brevity, only overall data shown and no breakdown per group (Table 2). 
Of note, slightly fewer patients in the placebo group compared to ‘all empagliflozin’ reported a history of 
recurrent or chronic urinary tract infection (5.6% v 6.7%). 
In the placebo group, more medications were introduced during the trial, especially antidiabetic (31.5% 
placebo v. 19.5% empagliflozin) and anti-hypertensive (51.0% v 44.5%). 
Patients on metformin at baseline had similar demographics and baseline characteristics as the entire trial 
population. A small difference to the entire trial population was seen for renal function. Among the 
subgroup with metformin intake, more patients had normal renal function (metformin subgroup: 25.0%, 
overall: 21.9%) and fewer patients had moderate renal impairment than in the entire trial population 
(20.6% vs. 25.5%). This can be explained by the fact that in Europe (at the time of trial conduct) 
metformin had not been indicated in patients with a low creatinine clearance. 
For patients using Synjardy, the daily metformin dose is 1700-2000 mg according to the SmPC. Among 
the patients with metformin background therapy at baseline, the median daily dose of metformin was 
1700 mg (range 200 to 4250 mg/day). The daily metformin dose was below 1500 mg in 26.5% of patients 
(those with metformin), while it was at least 1700 mg in 65.5% of patients. The daily dose was >2000 mg 
in 21.0% of patients receiving metformin. Metformin doses at baseline were somewhat higher in the 
placebo group (median 2000 mg, mean 1768 mg) than in the empagliflozin groups (all empagliflozin: 
median 1700 mg, mean 1743 mg). More patients in the placebo group (16.7%) than in the empagliflozin 
groups (all empagliflozin: 8.8%) increased the metformin dose for at least 7 consecutive days during the 
treatment period. In contrast, decreases occurred at similar frequencies in all 3 treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
Several analysis sets were defined for the various analyses in this trial. An overview of the number of 
patients in each analysis set is provided in Table 3. The treated set (TS) was used for the primary 
analysis. It comprised all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and thus 
excluded 8 randomised but not treated patients.  
Table 3 Patient analysis sets (all patients) 
The RS, TS, FAS, PPS and OS all included at least 98.2% of randomised patients in each group and thus 
largely overlap. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 3-point MACE 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke 
and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis based on the 
TS showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo (Table 4). The Kaplan-Meier estimates 
for time to first 3-point MACE are shown in Figure 3 - Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first 
3-point MACE, all empagliflozin vs. placebo – TS (patients taking metformin; x-axis: study 
day).

Figure 3 - Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first 3-point MACE, all empagliflozin vs. placebo – 
TS (patients taking metformin; x-axis: study day) 
The primary analysis based on TS described above included all events until individual trial completion, 
following the ITT principle. Results from the sensitivity and additional analyses (such as on-treatment 
analysis and analysis based on the per-protocol set) were generally consistent with the results of the 
primary analysis.  
The breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the somewhat lower frequency of 3-point 
MACE for empagliflozin was primarily due to the lower frequency of CV death (Table 5). Assessments of 
the time to first events for each MACE component as individual outcome endpoint are described in the 
sections below, and confirmed a reduction in CV death with empagliflozin treatment.

Key secondary endpoint: 4-point MACE 
The key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was 
non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (Table 6 below). The result of the 
additional component in the 4-point MACE, hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris, showed no 
significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo treatment. Also in metformin users, the results 
were similar (placebo: 48 (2.8%), all empa 91 (2.6%)).

Component: CV death (and all-cause mortality) 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group (all 
users) compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the two 
empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, but also non-CV death was 
numerically reduced in the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (Table 7 below). The 
additional analyses using an on-treatment approach showed results consistent with the main analyses 
following the ITT analysis principle. Also, an analysis for time to all-cause mortality assuming all 36 
patients lost to follow up in the empagliflozin groups as deceased further confirmed the robustness of the 
main analysis (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; post hoc). The analyses of subgroups (including by age, 
sex, renal function, glucose control and medication use at baseline; performed for CV death and all-cause 
mortality post hoc) showed consistent results across all subgroups. 
The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were “other CV death”, including fatal events deemed 
not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and 
worsening of heart failure (30). The majority of the non-CV deaths at system organ class (SOC) level were 
benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasms (incl. cysts and polyps; 69 of 154 patients with non-CV 
deaths) and infections and infestations (37). 
For both CV death and all-cause mortality, the separation of the event rates between empagliflozin and 
placebo started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial (Figure 8).

Component: Stroke and Cerebrovascular disease-related outcomes 
For stroke (fatal/non-fatal), non-fatal stroke, and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), no significant 
difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo (Table 9). Strokes were classified into 
ischaemic, haemorrhagic, and type not assessable by the CEC neurology. The majority of confirmed 
strokes were ischaemic.

Although not statistically significant, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1. Therefore 
stroke results were further investigated. In the TS analysis including all events up to individual trial 
completion, the Kaplan-Meier estimates showed almost no difference between empagliflozin (both doses) 
and placebo in the probability of stroke up to Day 600; thereafter, empagliflozin 10 mg started to 
separate from placebo, and empagliflozin 25 mg after about Day 900 (Figure 5). For patients in Europe, 
the differences are larger and the separation appears earlier (around Day 180) for both doses (Figure 6). 
When analysing treatment-emergent stroke using a cut-off for the observation period after treatment 
stop (7, 30, 90 days after treatment stop on TS; 30 days after treatment stop on OS; see Figure 2), the 
results showed no significant differences between empagliflozin and placebo, and the hazard ratio point 
estimate shifted towards unity when compared with the analysis of all events following the ITT analysis 
principle (Figure 6). The difference between empagliflozin and placebo in the ITT analysis was largely 
caused by more events occurring beyond 90 days after treatment stop in the empagliflozin groups 
(10 mg: 11 patients with stroke; 25 mg: 7 patients) than in the placebo group (3 patients). 
In the subgroup analyses of time to first stroke, a nominal treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-value 
<0.05 was observed for the parameters baseline HbA1c and geographic region.

Heart failure-related outcomes 
Heart failure endpoints were analysed in exploratory manner. The risk was reduced in the “all 
empagliflozin” group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (Table 10). The 
additional analyses using an on-treatment approach showed results consistent with the main analyses 
which followed the ITT principle. The analyses of subgroups (including by age, sex, renal function, glucose 
control, cardiac failure based on SMQ, diuretics and other medication use at baseline; performed for the 
first 2 heart failure endpoints) showed consistent results across all subgroups. Moreover, the frequencies

of patients with AEs requiring hospitalisation (a criterion for SAE) were numerically lower in the 
empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 32.0%; 25 mg: 34.9%) than placebo (36.5%)

Composite microvascular endpoints 
The composite microvascular outcome was defined as the time to first occurrence of any of the following 
nephropathy or eye related events: 
•  New or worsening nephropathy defined as any of the following: 
New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) 
Doubling of serum creatinine level accompanied by an eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73m2  
Initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy  
Death due to renal disease 
•  Diabetic eye complications 
Initiation of retinal photocoagulation 
Vitreous haemorrhage 
Diabetes-related blindness (included any blindness reported) 
For the two composite microvascular outcome endpoints, the risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” 
group compared with the placebo group (patients with event placebo: 424 (20.5%); all empa: 577 
(14.0%); HR 0.62 95% CI: 0.54, 0.70). The majority of the events of the microvascular outcome 
endpoints were new onset of nephropathy (see the section below). For all diabetic eye complication 
endpoints, the incidence rates were low (<5/1000 patient-year) and no significant difference was 
observed between empagliflozin and placebo.

eGFR change over time 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than 
in the placebo group after about a year (Figure 9). About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR 
increased from the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, 
while no change was seen in the placebo group.

Further Efficacy endpoints 
The protocol encouraged the investigators to treat CV risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, high blood 
pressure, albuminuria, unhealthy lifestyle, or smoking according to standard of care to eliminate the 
effect of confounding factors for the analysis of CV outcome. In a high CV risk population, this usually 
implies liberal addition and modification of anti-diabetic and other background therapy. In fact, 
anti-diabetic rescue medication was added or increased (except for the first 12 weeks) in study 1245.25 
in patients receiving empagliflozin 10 mg by 33.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg by 31.8%, and placebo by 
54.2% of patients.  
The main focus of the CV outcome study was to monitor long-term CV safety of empagliflozin. Although 
the design reflects in principle the real-world effectiveness, the results are different from those gained in 
pivotal studies which focused on the efficacy of empagliflozin, evaluated as change from baseline in 
HbA1c. 
The results on HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP and DBP in this study were affected by change in 
background therapies such as anti-diabetic and antihypertensive medications. Therefore, the applicant 
believes that a direct comparison of HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight from study 1245.25 with other 
phase 3 studies does not have scientific merit and is potentially misleading.  
Still, reductions in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP were seen for empagliflozin compared with 
placebo. The analyses of the efficacy endpoints were only performed for the overall trial population

Summary of main study 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present

EudraCT 2009-016178-33  
BI Trial Number: 1245.25 
This was a randomised, double-blind, multinational, parallel group, event-driven study 
with 3 treatment groups. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg once 
daily, empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, or placebo, as add-on to standard of care treatment, 
including for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. After screening, all eligible 
patients underwent a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period before randomisation. The 
end of study visit was to take place within ±7 days of a scheduled visit date after the last 
dose of study medication for patients who prematurely discontinued or at study closure for 
patients ongoing when the required number of outcome events was anticipated to have 
been reached for the trial. A final follow-up visit was planned 30 days after the end of 
treatment visit. Patients who discontinued or withdrew from trial medication after 
randomisation (Visit 3 and beyond) were to be followed up until the end of the study using 
the same visit schedule until the end of the trial. The observational period for a patient was 
from randomisation until the last visit after study closure announcement (including 30 days 
after the last on-treatment visit). The planned treatment duration was anticipated to be 
approximately 6 and 8 years (approximately 300 to 420 weeks), depending on the 
expected accrual period of 2 years and the assumed 3-point MACE event rate and the 
different times at which patients were randomised. The actual study duration depended on 
the first occurrence of primary outcome events; a minimum of 691 patients with 
adjudicated primary outcome events were required for the primary analysis. 
An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee) was established to 
adjudicate centrally and in a blinded fashion, all fatal events and events suspected of 
stroke, myocardial ischaemia (incl. myocardial infarction), cardiac failure, and coronary 
revascularization procedures, as detailed in the CEC charter. Additionally, specified events 
of cancer and hepatic events were adjudicated by external independent committees. A 
project based data monitoring committee (DMC), independent of the sponsor was 
established to monitor patient safety across several phase IIb/III empagliflozin trials, and 
to advise the sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop one or all trials involved. A 
Steering Committee was established to provide scientific leadership for the design and 
conduct of this study and interpretation of data.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
EMPA-REG was a cardiovascular outcome trial in type 2 diabetes patients. The primary objective of such 
trials is to exclude a harmful effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. MACE-3 was the primary 
endpoint for the trial, which is the preferred endpoint for safety studies according to EMA guidance 
(Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes 
mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1)). MACE-4 was assessed as key secondary endpoint which can be 
accepted. The primary and key secondary endpoints were assessed for both non-inferiority and 
superiority. 
The inclusion criteria specify a population with T2DM at especially high risk for CV events, specified by a 
history of at least one CV event such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease or 
significant coronary artery disease. Contrary to the current SmPC of Synjardy, subjects with moderate 
renal insufficiency (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min 1.73m2) were fully eligible for treatment both with 
10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin OD. In these patients also metformin could be used, although it was 
contraindicated in Europe during the time when the trial was conducted. Patients could only be included 
if glycaemic control was insufficient 
The population that was actually investigated, included 41.1% subjects from Europe and 44.6% of 
subjects were above 65 years of age. This is considered representative for the European T2DM population 
with documented atherosclerotic disease. The previously excluded population with eGFR < 45 
ml/min/1.73 m2 was represented by 570 (8.1%) of subjects. 
The sample size estimations are considered adequate. The event rates were around 4%/year and higher 
than anticipated (2%/year). This emphasizes that the patients were at very high risk indeed. Compared 
to the original planning, the trial was shorter and retention was higher than expected as the trial was 
ended (according to plan) when a sufficient number of events was observed. 
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 
25 mg; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (<8.5 or 
≥8.5% at screening), BMI (<30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, 
Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: 
eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2; moderate impairment: 
eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m2). As these factors are prognostically important, this stratification helped 
to ensure baseline comparability of the treatment groups. There are no concerns related to randomisation 
or blinding or group differences in baseline characteristics. 
The type-I error was adequately preserved for the primary and key secondary endpoints (MACE-3 and 
MACE-4) by a hierarchical approach including both non-inferiority and superiority testing. However, the 
results of all other endpoints were exploratory and should be considered hypothesis-generating. 
According to the Points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal study 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99), the minimum requirement for authorisation is generally one controlled study with 
statistically compelling and clinically relevant results and it is regulatory practice that evidence from a 
single pivotal trial is generally required to be stronger than the nominal level used in an application with 
multiple pivotal trials. In addition, internal and external validity, clinical relevance, data quality and 
internal consistency should be supportive. The phase-3 results submitted with the original MAA are 
primarily supportive for safety. While the primary endpoint and the mortality data are considered highly 
reliable, all endpoints besides MACE-3 and MACE-4 in EMPA-REG were exploratory and for these 
exploratory results the effect of chance findings is an important concern. 
Empagliflozin was administered once daily, whereas in Synjardy it is administered twice daily. In the 
original MAA for Synjardy, differences between once or twice daily administration were assessed as not 
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 36/57 
 
  
  
 
clinically relevant. The daily metformin dose was in the range that can be achieved with Synjardy in 
44.5% of metformin using patients (below 1700 mg: 34.5%, above 2000 mg: 21%). Of the randomised 
patients, 74.0% used metformin. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo if 
analysed without consideration of background therapy. The results were similar in exploratory analyses 
for both empagliflozin doses. Due to the wider confidence intervals, these results were not statistically 
significant. The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower 
frequency of 3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily due to the lower frequency of CV death. The 
results of the per protocol analysis (PPA) and sensitivity analyses were generally consistent, but in the 
PPA statistical significance was not reached. 
Some subgroups of the primary endpoint deserve further attention: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The results for the subgroups age: 50-<65 years and weight: 70-80 kg were inconsistent with 
both lower and higher subgroups. There was, however, no trend in the results across age and 
weight classes (Figure 5, 6).  
The results in users of thiazolidinediones and DPP4-inhibitors showed trends in the wrong 
direction (HR 1.13 and 1.27 respectively for all empa). This is especially surprising as these 
products have been linked to cardiac failure in the past. For thiazolidinediones the mortality 
results were in line with the overall trial result, but for DPP-4 inhibitors the estimate of the HR for 
CV mortality was > 1. 
The results in Black or African American patients (n = 357; HR: 1.48) showed trends in the wrong 
direction.  This was driven by strokes and MI, while the effects on CV mortality and HF were 
apparently maintained. However, as also the trend for all-cause mortality was unfavourable, the 
uncertainties regarding this subgroup have been mentioned in 4.4 (SmPC). 
The results in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) were less 
favourable than the results with impaired renal function, especially on the component ‘stroke’ 
(see below). 
The benefits in Europe and North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia (see 
below).  
In the end, the results in these subgroups were considered consistent with the overall trial results based 
on statistical considerations. 
For the key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) empagliflozin (doses pooled) was non-inferior, but not 
superior, to placebo. The results for 10 and 25 mg were similar. 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group 
and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. Again, there were no obvious 
differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and 
non-CV death was numerically reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group.  
Although mortality (all-cause and non-CV) was only tested in an exploratory way, the results are 
considered robust. Both CV-mortality and non-CV mortality favoured empagliflozin. Vital status 
information was available for all but 53 patients. The benefit for empagliflozin was confirmed in a 
sensitivity analysis assuming all empagliflozin treated-patients lost to follow up had died. 
The mortality results were obtained in addition to standard of care which included blood 
pressure-lowering medications (used by 95% of patients at baseline), lipid-lowering medications (81%),

Page 37/57 
 
  
  
 
and anticoagulants (89%, in the vast majority anti-platelets), most of which have been proven to 
decrease CV death. The reduction in the risk of all-cause death can be translated into a number needed 
to treat (NNT) of 67 to prevent 1 death in 3.2 years among metformin users. This number is clearly larger 
than the NNT of 39 obtained in the entire trial population. 
There was a rapid response to empagliflozin treatment, with a lower probability of death for empagliflozin 
with the curves separating from placebo as early as the first month based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
The probability of death continued to separate throughout the observation period. The magnitude of the 
effect is in line with that seen in the outcome trials that established the use of statins or ACEi /ARBs. 
(angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers). 
The positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular complications has until now only been demonstrated 
for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This is the first time since 1998 that the efficacy of an antidiabetic 
medicinal product in decreasing cardiovascular events is shown in a large clinical trial. In the case of 
EMPA-REG the effect on MACE-3 was largely driven by the effect on cardiovascular death, which is the 
most important mortality in type 2 diabetes. 
For all myocardial infarction-related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between 
empagliflozin and placebo, but the point estimate slightly favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR: 0.87; 
95% CI 0.70, 1.09). Silent MI, defined as single flagged ECG and not confirmed by the adjudication 
committee, was not part of the primary endpoint. All of these flagged ECG cases were sent to the central 
adjudication committee for assessing any outcome events. The outcome of unconfirmed single flagged 
ECG favoured placebo (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.70, 2.33). The unconfirmed single flagged ECG defined as 
‘silent MI’ was only assessable in a limited number of patients, as it required an ECG at baseline without 
major abnormalities and excluded patients with prior MI-related adjudicated outcome events. The fact 
that the primary endpoint was reworded regarding silent MIs raised questions as to whether this could 
have been a modification potentially based on unblinded data, and not a clarification as described in the 
study report. The MAH clarified that silent MI had never been a part of the primary endpoint and justified 
the reasons for this. 
Although not statistically significant in the primary analysis, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke 
was clearly above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.92, 1.67). The MAH has compared the 
On-treatment set (+30 days) with the Treated set and concludes that this result is driven by events 
during observation after treatment (23 empa, 3 placebo). In the subgroup of patients in Europe, the 
adverse effect was larger, is already evident in the Kaplan-Meier curve at 180 days and even reached 
statistical significance (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.26-3.29). In light of this finding, the results for other selected 
endpoints (as reported in the study report) in Europe were summarized (Figure 17). This shows that the 
results for MACE-3 and all its components, and also, MACE-4 in Europe (and North America)are less 
favourable than the overall trial results. No plausible explanation (e.g. in terms of differences in baseline 
parameters or background treatment) for the findings in Europe has been identified. These may be 
attributable to chance. In general, the excess of strokes during treatment with empagliflozin (if not 
chance) may be partly related to the decrease of circulating blood volume, which can be seen as an 
increased haematocrit in the empagliflozin treated groups. This latter finding has been described in 4.8 
(SmPC). 
Apparently, the mortality benefits are not explained by a risk reduction for atherosclerotic events. 
Instead, the MAH suggests that a reduction of heart failure related events may be one of the factors 
driving the benefit. The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were “other CV death”, including 
fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden 
deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). This pattern could indeed be compatible with mortality 
from heart failure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 38/57 
 
  
  
 
Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes (e.g. 22% of those aged ≥65 years) and 
associated with increased mortality (in the referenced study a 5-year survival rate of only 12.5%) 
[Bertoni AG, Diabetes Care 2004]. Heart failure related endpoints were predefined (but exploratory) in 
the EMPA-REG study. For all heart failure endpoints, the risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group 
and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (Hospitalisation for heart failure: HR: 
0.65). 
The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint “new or worsening nephropathy” was reduced for 
both empagliflozin doses (HR all empa: 0.61 ). This was primarily driven by “New onset of 
macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g)”. No obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was 
observed for new onset of albuminuria (HR 0.95).  
For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at 
baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin 
than with placebo (patients with improvement, HR > 1 favours empa: microalbuminuria HR 1.43; 
macroalbuminuria: HR 1.82). There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose 
groups. These results are maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency. 
All patients had cardiovascular disorders, and it seems obvious that this patient population had also 
nefrangioscleroses. Moreover, most patients in this trail were already diagnosed with a renal 
insufficiency. Although the incidence rates for decreased renal function were lower in the empagliflozin 
group, the microvascular endpoint ‘nephropathy’ should be taken with special consideration, since: 
•  19,5% of the included patients were diagnosed with a ‘diabetic nephropathy’, and were equally 
divided in different groups. Since however the diagnosis of nephropathy was based on the 
measurement of eGFR and not based on a pathological diagnosis due to a renal biopsy, the 
distinction between a diabetic nephropathy and an ischemic nephropathy due to cardiovascular 
diseases could not be made. Moreover, in practice only a subset of patients with diabetes type 2 
have typical diabetes glomerulopathy in biopsies. Therefore it is not sure how many patients 
indeed had a diabetic nephropathy in this study population 
•  Microalbuminuria is a common feature of aging and can be associated with a large number of 
acute and chronic inflammatory as well as vascular pathologies. Furthermore, microalbuminuria 
is often transient and reversible. Therefore, the adverse event of albuminuria should be taken 
with some reservation, albuminuria is not a specific parameter for renal insufficiency. 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than 
in the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from 
the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was 
seen in the placebo group. These data suggest that the initial decrease seen with empagliflozin treatment 
is haemodynamic in nature.  
Taken together, prevention of new albuminuria, reversal of existing albuminuria and prevention of the 
usual decline of eGFR in type 2 diabetes patients all suggest that empagliflozin may be important in the 
prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. This result was an exploratory finding in EMPA-REG 
and requires further confirmation. Many questions are still open, e.g. the development of eGFR in 
subjects with impaired renal function and how these potential benefits interact with other medicinal 
products, either usually beneficial (ACE-inhibitors) or detrimental (NSAIDs). 
The underlying nephro-protective mechanism of empagliflozin is not clear but may at least partly be due 
to the attenuation of renal hyperfiltration via tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanisms [Skrtic M, 
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 39/57 
 
  
  
 
Diabetologia, 2014; Cherney DZI, Circulation, 2013]. Renal hyperfiltration results in increased 
glomerular pressure and can lead to albuminuria, renal function decline, and renal impairment. Altered 
hemodynamics may also explain the improvement seen in the occurrence of heart failure and either 
directly or indirectly contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular mortality.  
When the results of subjects using metformin at baseline are compared to the overall trial population 
(Figure 10), a high level of consistency is obvious, but the results among metformin users are somewhat 
mitigated compared to all patients. The MAH emphasizes that even if the result seems less than additive, 
still a benefit for empagliflozin (and metformin) exists. 
In EMPA-REG, patients could be included with any eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73m2 and they were eligible for 
both dose levels of empagliflozin. For Jardiance, the MAH proposes to lift the restriction for use in patients 
with moderate renal insufficiency based on these results.  
Based on the analysis of MACE-3, all-cause and CV mortality, it can be agreed that the results for 
moderate renal insufficiency are in line with the overall trial results. Exploratory results for heart failure 
requiring hospitalisation and new or worsening nephropathy suggest that the efficacy is at least 
maintained with worsening renal function.  
Efficacy for glycaemic control in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency was similar to previous results. 
In these patients, no clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control has been shown. Although 
empagliflozin has shown beneficial CV effects in these patients, the inclusion in SmPC section 4.2  (as 
proposed by the applicant) of patients with eGFR below 45 ml/min/1.73m2  was not supported by the 
CHMP, as glycaemic efficacy is considered essential for any diabetes product. Therefore, the posology in 
patients with renal impairment should remain unchanged. 
The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. There were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like, HbA1c, FPG, blood 
pressure and weight; only in subjects with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73m2. For the proposed CV prevention 
indication, the higher dose has no advantages. 
Treatment with metformin was not a randomised treatment but a possible antidiabetic background 
medication in this study; patients who were not on metformin at baseline but started metformin only 
during the trial were excluded from this analysis.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
EMPA-REG was a well-designed and well-conducted trial. The trial showed superiority of empagliflozin to 
placebo on the primary outcome MACE-3, that was driven by benefits on CV mortality and the effect 
shown on all-cause mortality was consistent. Exploratory results suggest that prevention of heart failure 
and less worsening nephropathy may explain the findings. However, for an application based on a single 
pivotal trial, the inconsistent additional endpoints (stroke, silent MI) and inconsistent subgroups 
(especially Europe) raise concerns. The included population was at especially high cardiovascular risk. 
Therefore, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to the entire diabetic population. 
In the population using metformin as background therapy, the benefits are maintained, but the risk 
reduction is mitigated.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In phase 3, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to 
placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia when used with 
sulphonylurea or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are directly related to the mode of 
action. Genital and urinary tract infections are common. 
Patient exposure 
The median observation period was about 3.2 years for each treatment group. The total observation time 
per treatment group using metformin at baseline was at least 5112 years (Table 17 Observational 
period – TS). The total exposure to treatment per group (all patients) was at least 5747 years (Table 18 
Exposure to randomised trial medication – TS (all patients).

Table 17 Exposure to randomised trial medication – TS (all patients) 
Adverse events 
The incidence rates for any AE and for SAEs (and fatal SAEs) were lower for patients treated with 
empagliflozin than placebo. The incidence rates for drug-related AEs as defined by the investigator were 
higher for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. For other categories of AEs, including those 
leading to discontinuation of study medication, there was no marked imbalance between the 3 treatment 
groups (Table 19). 
Most frequently reported Adverse Events 
AE incidence rates and patterns were generally consistent between the entire trial population and the 
patients who received metformin at baseline. 
Of the most frequently reported AEs at PT level, similar rates across the 3 treatment arms were reported 
for urinary tract infection and hypoglycaemia. Lower incidence rates for hyperglycaemia were reported 
for patients treated with empagliflozin (metformin subgroup – empagliflozin 10 mg: 
3.80/100 patient-years; 25 mg: 3.33/100 pt-yrs) than for placebo (8.24/100 pt-yrs)  
Of the less frequently reported AEs, imbalances in incidence rates between empagliflozin and placebo 
groups were observed for PTs associated with genital infections, or with other AEs known to occur with 
empagliflozin (such as dysuria, pollakisuria, and polyuria). The rate for PT thirst was higher in the 
empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.12/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 0.32/100 pt-yrs) than placebo (0.09/100 pt-yrs). 
Urinary tract infections were reported slightly less frequently in the placebo group for metformin users but 
not for all users. 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation at the PT level were myocardial 
infarction and acute myocardial infarction, with similar rates in all treatment groups.  
The overall incidence rates of AEs assessed as drug-related by the investigators were higher for both 
empagliflozin groups than the placebo group. This was largely due to higher incidence rates for AEs in the 
SOCs reproductive system and breast disorders, renal and urinary disorders, and investigations. At the PT 
level, slight imbalances in incidence rates between the empagliflozin and placebo groups followed the

differences in the SOCs, with higher incidence rates for the empagliflozin groups compared with placebo 
observed, for example, for balanoposthitis, vulvovaginal pruritus, genital pruritus, decreased weight, 
pollakisuria, and polyuria. 
The most frequently reported AEs with severe intensity were in the SOCs cardiac disorders and infections 
and infestations. The frequency of severe cardiac disorders was slightly lower for patients treated with 
empagliflozin (metformin subgroup – empagliflozin 10 mg: 7.1%; 25 mg: 7.0%) than for placebo 
(8.9%). The frequencies of severe events at the PT level within the SOC cardiac disorders tended to be 
slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups than for placebo. For infections and infestations, the most 
frequently reported PT, pneumonia, was reported in the entire trial population at slightly lower 
frequencies for patients in the empagliflozin groups than placebo; in the metformin subgroup, frequencies 
were similar in all 3 treatment groups. With regard to severe nervous system disorders, the frequency of 
ischaemic stroke was slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups (metformin subgroup – empagliflozin 10 
mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.1%) than for placebo (0.5%). The frequency of cerebrovascular accident was higher 
for the empagliflozin groups than placebo in the entire trial population and in the metformin subgroup 
(placebo: 26/1730, 1.5%; 60/3459, 1.7%). 
Serious adverse events/ deaths/other significant events 
The overall incidence rates for fatal AEs were lower for patients treated with empagliflozin than for 
patients treated with placebo (Table 19). At the PT level, the most frequently reported fatal AEs were 
myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure 
were less frequently reported for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. Incidence rates for the 
other most frequently reported PTs (≥0.2% in any group) were generally similar between the 
empagliflozin and placebo treatment groups or slightly lower for empagliflozin than placebo. As for most 
of the AE analyses in this trial, the fatal AE analyses were based on a follow-up period of 7 days after 
treatment stop, and therefore the numbers of patients with fatal AEs differ from the numbers for all-cause 
mortality (for which the follow-up was until individual trial end). Nonetheless, the reduction in deaths in 
the empagliflozin groups is seen in both analyses. 
The incidence rates of SAEs (which included fatal and non-fatal SAEs) were slightly lower for patients 
treated with empagliflozin than for patients treated with placebo (Table 19), largely due to lower 
incidence rates of serious cardiac disorders in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. At the 
PT level, a number of SAEs had slightly lower incidence rates for patients on empagliflozin than on placebo 
(angina unstable, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, cardiac failure congestive, myocardial 
ischaemia, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, pneumonia). Other PTs had higher incidence rates for patients on 
empagliflozin than for patients on placebo (urosepsis, cerebrovascular accident). 
The overall incidence rates for SAEs that were immediately life-threatening were higher in the 
empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group, largely due to the higher incidence rates of cardiac 
disorders that were immediately life-threatening (metformin at baseline: placebo 27 (1.6%); empa 10 
mg: 34 (2.0%); empa 25 mg 42 (2.4%)). However, the incidence rates for combined fatal or 
immediately-life-threatening SAEs, overall and for the SOC cardiac disorders, were lower for 
empagliflozin. 
Adverse Events of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or non-serious) was an AE of scientific, medical, or 
regulatory concern. A total of 11 categories of adverse events of special interest were analysed in this trial 
(Table 20). 
The incidence rates of genital infections and urinary tract infections were higher in the empagliflozin 
10 mg and 25 mg groups than in the placebo group.

Although the incidence rate of hepatic injury was slightly lower in both empagliflozin groups than the 
placebo group, there were slightly more serious cases. 
Five patients in total were reported with diabetic ketoacidosis (2 of these in the metformin subgroup) 
and the rates were comparable in all groups. The frequencies of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events 
were also comparable in all groups, including frequencies for events where the patient required 
assistance. The above observations were true for the entire trial population as well as for the subgroup of 
patients on metformin at baseline. 
Bone fractures occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared to the empagliflozin groups. 
The overall frequencies and incidence rates for malignancy up to trial termination were somewhat higher 
for the empagliflozin-treated groups; the same was true for patients with malignancy with an onset after 
6 months of exposure to study medication (Table 20). 
Laboratory findings 
No new safety issues were identified in the analysis of laboratory results 
Safety in special populations 
The incidence of AEs and SAEs increases with age, but similarly in placebo and empagliflozin-treated 
groups. No specific data were provided for users of metformin at baseline. For the tables, reference is 
made to the AR of Jardiance.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in trial 1245.25 is consistent with the known safety profile of 
empagliflozin. Only thirst is proposed by the MAH as a new side effect after their assessment of all 
available clinical data and in light of the new data from trial 1245.25. Thirst was not included in the 
definition of volume depletion as used by the MAH and therefore evaluated separately. In the pooling of 
all placebo-controlled trials with a treatment duration of 18 to 24 weeks (not including 1245.25), which 
was designated for side-effects labelling, the PT thirst was reported for 1.3% of the patients in either 
empagliflozin group (10 mg or 25 mg), while not reported in the placebo group. These data are consistent 
with the results from the largest safety pooling supporting the initial marketing application and from trial 
1245.25 (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). The addition of thirst is therefore 
agreed. Besides, elderly patients, who are often exposed to multi drug treatments, including diuretics and 
ACE-inhibitors are vulnerable for volume depletion. Therefore, a special warning should be added in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC  
The new data about AEs that were collected are in line with previous knowledge about empagliflozin as 
documented in the SmPC. This also applies to the AEs of special interest. Although this was a large trial, 
the numbers of rare events are still too low to draw definite conclusions. Of note: 
•  Hepatic events were carefully assessed by a blinded committee. Although infrequent, serious hepatic 
injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the empagliflozin groups 
(increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No definite cases of DILI 
were identified as according to the committee confounding factors were present. 
• 
In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the 
empagliflozin 25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, 
compared with 5 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The overall incidence rate of (complicated) 
UTIs was higher in the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group among users of metformin at 
baseline (but not in the entire trial). The text regarding UTI in Section 4.4 of the SmPC is still 
acceptable. 
• 
The frequency of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events was similar in all treatment groups within 
each subgroup (e.g. by age, renal impairment, use of insulin at baseline), except for the subgroup 
with SU at baseline. It is somewhat surprising that concomitant use of SUs is associated with less 
hypoglycaemias (all subjects: with SU: 24.5% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 25.0% for empagliflozin 25 
mg, 23.4% for placebo; without SU: 30.5 % for empagliflozin 10 mg, 29.7 % for empagliflozin 25 mg, 
31.2 % for placebo).  
•  Use of loop diuretics was associated with a higher risk of volume depletion in the empagliflozin groups 
(10 mg: 4.92/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 4.45/100 pt-yrs) than in the placebo group (3.69/100 pt-yrs). This 
association is already mentioned in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
• 
There was no clear increase in the incidence of keto-acidosis. 
•  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo 
treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. 
However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the 
groups become very small. 
The following additional laboratory value changes should be added to the Jardiance SmPC because these 
safety issues are now confirmed in empa-reg and other trials with FDC: 
• 
Increase in haematocrit should be added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 47/57 
 
  
  
 
• 
Increase in serum lipids should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The established safety profile, as described in the SmPC is confirmed. Thirst can be added as a common 
adverse reaction. The SmPC should be extended with information on the increase in haematocrit (section 
4.4 and section 4.8) and serum lipids (section 4.8). 
The safety profile in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency who use empagliflozin is comparable to 
placebo, although the AE rates are higher than in subjects with normal renal function. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.4 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 8.4 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Synjardy is currently indicated to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. In this type 2 variation, 
and based on the results of the EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial, the MAH initially sought an 
additional indication for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and 
established cardiovascular disease . During the assessment, also modification of the current indication 
was discussed. A similar variation for Jardiance was recently agreed by CHMP. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial included 7028 diabetic patients with established 
cardiovascular disease (high cardiovascular risk defined as at least one of the following risk factors: 
myocardial infarction or CVA within 2 months before inclusion, coronary heart disease, instable angina 
pectoris, peripheral arterial disease). At baseline, 74% of the participants used metformin. The patients 
were randomised between placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg OD and empagliflozin 25 mg OD. Patients were 
followed up for a median of 3.1 years. The trial was stopped according to plan after 691 events had been 
observed. 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke 
and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis [based on the 
treated set population] showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo. The results were 
similar in the subgroup of users taking metformin at baseline. In this subgroup, patients with events were 
189/1734 (10.9%) for placebo and 344/3459 (9.9%) for all empagliflozin treated patients. The HR was 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.10). The results were similar (although not statistically significant) in exploratory 
analyses for both empagliflozin doses  
The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 
3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily driven by the lower frequency of CV death (placebo: 84 
(4.8%), all empa: 118 (3.4%)). The most prevalent categorisations of the CV deaths were “other CV 
death”, including fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (in all patients: 129 of 309 with CV 
death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). For all myocardial

infarction-related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo, 
although the point estimate favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR:0.96; 95% CI 0.73, 1.25). Although 
not statistically significant, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 
1.21; 95% CI 0.85, 1.71). In Europe, the HR for stroke was statistically significant (all patients: HR 2.04, 
CI: 1.26, 3.29). The adverse effect on strokes was similar independent of metformin background use. 
The key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was 
non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (HR 0.94 (95% CI 0.80, 1.10)). The 
results for 10 and 25 mg were similar. 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group 
and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (all-cause mortality among metformin 
users: placebo: 115 (6.6%), empa: 176 (5.1%)). There were no obvious differences between the two 
empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and non-CV death was numerically 
slightly reduced in the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. The result was confirmed in 
a sensitivity analysis for all patients assuming all empagliflozin-treated-patients lost to follow up had 
died. 
The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints.  
Additional data were obtained with regard to pharmacokinetic through levels reflecting on exposure. 
These data confirm the PK information in the current SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Heart failure related endpoints were exploratory in this trial. For all heart failure endpoints, the risk was 
reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group 
(Patients with events of hospitalisation for heart failure: Placebo 3.4%, All empa 2.3%; HR: 0.68 (CI: 
0.49, 0.95)). 
The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint “new or worsening nephropathy” was reduced for 
empagliflozin (HR 0.68 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.79). This was primarily driven by “new onset of 
macro-albuminuria”. However, no obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed 
for new onset of albuminuria.  
For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at 
baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin 
than with placebo.There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. These 
results were maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency. 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than 
in the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from 
the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was 
seen in the placebo group.  
In all patients, there were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like HbA1c, FPG, blood 
pressure and weight, but these results (and their comparison to placebo) were not reported for metformin 
users. Similarly, the results in subjects with or without insulin at baseline should be provided for 
assessment.

Although most subgroups with regard to the primary endpoint were consistent with the main analysis, 
there were some exceptions. In the analysis of Black or African American patients, the HR for MACE-3 
favoured placebo (HR: 1.48). The results in users of thiazolidinediones and also DPP4-inhibitors showed 
trends in the wrong direction (HR 1.13 and 1.27). In these same subgroups, the HRs for CV mortality 
were 0.77, 0.60 and 1.23 respectively. In Black or African American patients, the HR for all-cause 
mortality was 1.25. 
The benefits in Europe and also North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia. The HR for 
MACE in Europe in all patients (41.1% of the patients) was 0.97 for the 10 mg dose and 1.07 for the 25 
mg dose, for North America (19.9% of the patients) this was 0.78 and 1.01 respectively.  
When the results of subjects using metformin at baseline are compared to the overall trial population, a 
high level of consistency is obvious, but the results among metformin users are mitigated compared to all 
patients (Figure 10).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG trial (1245.25) was consistent with the known safety 
profile of empagliflozin. In phase 3, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with 
empagliflozin was similar to placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia 
when empagliflozin was used with sulphonylurea or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are 
directly related to the mode of action. There was no clear increase in the occurrence of ketoacidosis 
(placebo: 1, empa 10 mg: 3, empa 25mg: 1).In EMPA-REG, thirst occurred more frequently with 
empagliflozin than with placebo (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). This ADR is 
not completely covered by the potentially related entity of ‘volume depletion’ and has thus been added to 
SmPC section 4.8. 
The MAH summarised AE data for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency and for older patients. 
Although in these groups the overall rate of AEs is higher than in the overall population, the AE profile is 
comparable to the total population. EMPA-REG confirmed increases in haematocrit and serum lipids. 
In metformin users, the AE pattern was consistent with the overall trial population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
For some rare AEs of special interest, the numbers of events were low despite the size of the trial. Of note: 
•  Serious hepatic injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the 
empagliflozin groups (increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No 
definite cases of DILI were identified as according to the hepatic events committee confounding 
factors were present. 
• 
In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the 
empagliflozin 25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, 
compared with 5 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The overall incidence rate of (complicated) 
UTIs was similar in the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group.  
•  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo 
treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. 
However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the 
groups become very small.

Benefit Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The EMPA-REG trial is a large, well-designed and well-conducted cardiovascular outcome trial. There are 
no major concerns related to group differences in baseline characteristics. The trial demonstrated 
superiority (p=0.04) of empagliflozin over placebo on the primary endpoint of MACE-3. When analysed by 
the individual components, this result is driven primarily by a benefit in CV death, starting to be 
significant as early as day 59. The components non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke 
showed statistically non-significant, heterogeneous differences, with a positive trend for non-fatal MI and 
a negative trend for stroke. The reduction in CV mortality appears largely independent of HbA1c and 
change from baseline in HbA1c, being even observed in subjects with baseline HbA1c < 7, and with 
similar results obtained for subjects with a reduction in HbA1c <0.3% or even an increase as compared to 
subjects with a decrease >0.3%. This separation of glucose lowering effect and reduction in CV mortality 
was confirmed by additional analyses and may suggest a different mode of action. 
All-cause mortality in these patients is mainly attributable to CV causes, but also non-CV causes favoured 
empagliflozin (although not statistically significant). This positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular 
complications had previously only been demonstrated for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This was the first 
time since 1998 that efficacy of an antidiabetic drug is demonstrated in decreasing cardiovascular events 
in a large clinical trial. The effect size for the reduction in the risk of death expressed as the number 
needed to treat (NNT) was 39 to prevent 1 death in 3.1 years and is considered clinically relevant. Among 
metformin users, the NNT is 67 to prevent 1 death in 3.2 years. Results are considered reliable as 
follow-up information for vital status was almost complete (>99%, only 53 patients missing) and the 
parameter is free from bias. This type 2 variation is based on the results of a single, but large pivotal 
clinical trial. The primary and key secondary endpoints were assessed for non-inferiority and superiority. 
These tests were defined in a hierarchical testing procedure. 
All other outcomes of the trial are considered exploratory, but show supportive results. This applies in 
particular to the heart failure and nephropathy related outcomes where significant and potentially 
clinically relevant results were observed. 
The results for stroke remain unexplained. This result was significant in the European population, leading 
to a neutral HR for the primary endpoint of MACE-3 in Europe (see Figure 17). However, trends were 
different for North and South America, and overall the HR was non-significant. With regards to the overall 
trial population, the MAH has provided data to show that part of the effect on stroke can be attributed to 
off-treatment events occurring late in the trial. There was no evidence of an association between stroke 
and volume depletion adverse events that occurred prior to a stroke nor with haemo-concentration. A 
similar trend is not seen for transient cerebral ischaemia (TIA). Also, no relevant difference in baseline 
characteristics was identified that could be related to such regional differences. 
Many subjects were included with eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m2, who could not use Synjardy. 
Since finalisation of the metformin Article 31 referral (EC decision 13 December 2016), use of Synjardy in 
these patients can be expanded. The results are largely in line with the overall trial population. The 
established mode of action, related to glycaemic control, does seem not to confer the mortality benefits. 
In this group of patients, the CV prevention effect has been shown, but the effect on glycaemic control is 
limited when eGFR is below 45 ml/min 1.73 m2. 
The safety profile confirms prior knowledge, no unexpected adverse effects occurred. As usual for this 
class of products, urogenital infections were more frequent among empagliflozin users. Bone fractures 
were not more frequent in empagliflozin treated patients. Ketoacidosis occurred in only 2 cases (both on 
empagliflozin) among patients using metformin. Malignancies occurred slightly more frequently in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 54/57 
 
  
  
 
empagliflozin-treated groups, but no specific malignancy was noticeable as after classification, the 
numbers were too small. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit in terms of reduction in cardiovascular deaths by treating DM patients with a history 
of a cardiovascular event with empagliflozin is considered clinically relevant and outweighs the risks. The 
small increase in non-ischemic stroke remains an uncertainty, but could be due to chance or baseline 
differences. The question is whether the over-all improved CV outcome justifies a new indication. This will 
be discussed further below. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
This Type II variation for Synjardy runs in parallel with a similar variation for Jardiance (empagliflozin, 
EMEA/H/C/002677/II/0014) which was finalised by CHMP in December 2016. The conclusion of that 
procedure will be the basis of the decision for Synjardy. The currently proposed revised indication 
statement is aligned with Jardiance.  
As more than 70% of the subjects in EMPA-REG were also metformin users (who are the focus of this 
document), similar results to the entire trial population are expected. Indeed, no important differences 
between the entire trial population and the subgroup of metformin users are found, although the benefits 
among metformin users are somewhat mitigated (Figure 10), e.g. NNT 67 to prevent 1 death in 3.2 years 
(metformin users) compared to 39 to prevent 1 death in 3.1 years (all patients). Results of EMPA-REG 
indicate that the subgroup of T2DM patients with established CV disease may benefit in terms of 
cardiovascular outcome. The issue discussed as part of the CHMP assessment for Jardiance was whether 
these patients and their goals of treatment should be mentioned in section 4.1. The indication proposed 
by the MAH was defining two T2DM populations, one large (T2DM) and one more restricted (patients with 
T2DM and established cardiovascular disease), aiming at two different goals of treatment (glycaemic 
control and reduction of cardiovascular death). Important in this regard is the view that the 
cardiovascular benefit appears to be not only explained by the glucose lowering effect of empagliflozin. 
The MAH supported this by arguments such as the time course of the effect observed with an early 
benefit, the independence of the size of the glucose lowering effects and the beneficial effects in patients 
with an eGFR between 30 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 where the glucose lowering effects are marginal. It is 
therefore unlikely that the effect is only based on an effect on atherosclerosis, glycaemia control or blood 
pressure. However, the exact mechanism of action remains speculative. Renal effects may play a role but 
further studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanism(s) and to confirm these beneficial 
effects. 
Apart from the mechanism of action, the MAH gave other arguments to separate glycaemic control and 
the reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the indication. Mentioning results only in section 5.1 would not 
be clear for the prescriber for whom sections 4.1 and 4.2 are more important. The posology proposed was 
different, as the 25 mg dose has no advantages for CV prevention compared to the 10 mg dose. In 
modern CV outcome trials investigating three different DPP-4 inhibitors and two GLP-1 analogues, 
modest differences in glucose control did not translate to improved CV outcomes, with the exception of 
the LEADER trial with liraglutide that was recently published (N Engl J Med 2016; 375:311-322). Finally, 
there are also precedents with other risk reducing therapies, such as the statins and ACE-inhibitors where 
a distinction in goals of treatment has been made in the indication between the metabolic/haemodynamic 
endpoint and the clinical outcome. 
An oral explanation was held by the applicant, as part of the parallel Jardiance procedure for EMPA-REG, 
presenting the rationale for their proposed indication (discussed above). The CHMP concluded that while 
EMPA REG is a positive cardiovascular outcome trial, treatment of T2DM may cover treatment and/or 
prevention of many co-morbidities. CHMP is of the view that in the indication section of the SmPC the 
Assessment report  
EMA/173251/2017 
Page 55/57 
 
  
  
 
patient population eligible for treatment with Synjardy should be mentioned, i.e. patients with T2DM, 
without mentioning any goal of treatment, i.e. neither improvement of glycaemic control, nor reduction of 
the risk of cardiovascular death. This means that the wording of the indication will refer to the patient 
population for whom treatment with empagliflozin is intended, i.e. patients with T2DM, and the 
information on the EMPA-REG study including the heterogeneity of the MACE-3 endpoint, will be included 
in section 5.1. The rationale for CHMPs decision is that the improvement in glucose control and reduction 
of cardiovascular events are the main goals of treatment for T2DM and should not be separated. These 
have now been demonstrated in the EMPA-REG trial for patients with established CV disease and may also 
apply to other T2DM patients. 
In line with the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics with regard to wording of the 
indication(s), the CHMP was of the view that the population studied in the EMPA-REG i.e. T2DM patients 
with established CV disease, is a sub-population of the already approved T2DM population for Jardiance 
and that the demonstrated effect of reduction of CV mortality is covered by the general indication 
“treatment of type 2 diabetes”; similarly, achievement of glycemic control is covered. Thus, the effect on 
CV mortality does not constitute a separate (prevention) indication. Therefore CHMP did not grant a 
separate CV prevention indication but deleted the endpoint “glycaemic control” from section 4.1 to clarify 
that the treatment goal for empagliflozin is not limited to glycaemic control. The results of the EMPA-REG 
are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, in the case of the current empagliflozin application based on a single pivotal trial some 
further considerations were: 1) EMPA-REG was primarily a safety study and the primary endpoint resulted 
in a p for superiority of only 0.04, 2) patients with established cardiovascular disease are only a subgroup 
of the total (T2DM) population with overlap between the two indications claimed, 3) the effect on the 
MACE-3 endpoint was inconsistent with an increase in stroke, and 4) the pharmacological principle is new 
and the mode of action for the latter effect has not been established. 
In line with the previous CHMP opinions on Jardiance and Jentadueto, the following indication was agreed 
by the CHMP:  
“Synjardy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise: 
• 
• 
in patients insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, in patients insufficiently 
controlled with metformin and these medicinal products 
in patients already being treated with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets. 
• 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.”

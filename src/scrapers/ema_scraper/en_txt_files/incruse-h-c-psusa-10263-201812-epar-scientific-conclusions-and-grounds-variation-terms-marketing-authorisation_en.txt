Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for umeclidinium, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Following a post-approval regulatory request in the last PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010263/201712), the 
MAH provided a review of the adverse drug reaction ‘dizziness’. The MAH retrieved 73 cases of ‘dizziness’ 
in the umeclidinium database, all from spontaneous source. Fifteen cases were serious, and five were due 
to a serious event of dizziness. In two cases, positive dechallenge was reported describing events that 
reoccurred the same day after each dose. The evidence presented suggests a possible causal association 
between umeclidinium and the event of dizziness. Based on the above and also taking into account that 
serious cases have been reported, the PRAC considered that a product information update with regard to 
the undesirable effect dizziness is warranted. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add ‘dizziness’ with a 
frequency not known is recommended. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing umeclidinium is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

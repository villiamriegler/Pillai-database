1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

treatment with one injection per month for three

agreed and reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Supported 
evidence came from extrapolated data from the ALTAIR 
study (conducted in Japanese subjects) to the Caucasian 
population and associated these results to an Ethnic 
Sensitivity Report.  
The ALTAIR study was an interventional study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of intravitreal 
(IVT) aflibercept with variable treatment intervals in 
Japanese subjects with neovascular AMD. The Ethnic 
Sensitivity Report concluded that IVT aflibercept is 
ethnically insensitive for Asians and Caucasians.

DRCR.net Protocol T 
Update of section 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) to provide data on an 
independent comparative trial (Protocol T). 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to condense Anti-Platelet Trialists’ 
collaboration (APTC) text in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
II and PL 
An independent comparative trial (DRCR.net Protocol T) 
utilised a dosing regimen based on strict OCT and vision re-
treatment criteria. In the aflibercept treatment group (n = 
224) at week 52, this treatment regimen resulted in 
patients receiving a mean of 9.2 injections, which is similar 
to the administered number of doses in the Eylea 2Q8 
group in VIVID DME and VISTA DME, while overall efficacy

as recommended during procedure II-18; to shorten 
section 5.1 of the SmPC as recommended during 
procedure II-21, and to implement minor changes 
within wet age related macular degeneration (AMD) 
and Diabetic Macular Oedema (DME) in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to provide 3-year 
data of the pivotal trials VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME 
as recommended during procedure II-09. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the QRD 
template version 9.1  
A revised RMP version 23.1 was agreed during this 
procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
of the aflibercept treatment group in Protocol T was 
comparable to the Eylea 2Q8 group in VIVID DME and 
VISTA DME. A 13.3 mean letter gain with 42% of patients 
gaining at least 15 letters in vision from baseline was 
observed in Protocol T. Ocular and systemic safety profiles 
(including ATEs) were similar to VIVID DME and VISTA 
DME. 
Diabetic macular oedema 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two 
randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-controlled 
studies in patients with DME (VIVID DME and VISTA DME). 
A total of 862 patients were treated and evaluable for 
efficacy, 576 with Eylea. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 
years with a mean of 63 years. In the DME studies, 
approximately 47% (268/576) of the patients randomised 
to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and 
approximately 9% (52/576) were 75 years of age or older. 
The majority of patients in both studies had Type II 
diabetes. In both studies, patients were randomly assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens:  
1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 
initial monthly injections (Eylea 2Q8);  
2) Eylea administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); 
and  
3) macular laser photocoagulation (active control).  
Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified 
threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional 
treatment: patients in the Eylea groups could receive laser 
and patients in the control group could receive Eylea. 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the 
mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 52 and both 
Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 2Q4 groups demonstrated statistical

opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in

during the procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

In the VIVID- DME and the VISTA- DME studies the mean 
decreases in central retinal thickness (CRT) at week 52 
were -192.4 and -183.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups 
and -66.2 and -73.3 micronsfor the control groups, 
respectively. At week 100 the decrease was maintained 
with -195.8 and -191.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups 
and -85.7 and -83.9 microns for the control groups, in the 
VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME studies, respectively. 
A ≥ 2 step improvement in DRSS was assessed in a pre-
specified manner in VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME. The DRSS 
score was gradable in73.7% of the patients in VIVID-DME 
and 98.3% of the patients in VISTA-DME. At week 52, 
27.7% and 29.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups, and 7.5% and 
14.3% of the control groups experienced a ≥2 step 
improvement in the DRSS. At week 100, the respective 
percentages were 32.6% and 37.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 
groups and 8.2% and 15.6% of  the control groups. 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the 
mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 52 as 
measured by ETDRS letter score. Both Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 
2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was 
statistically significantly superior to the control group. This 
benefit was maintained through week 100.

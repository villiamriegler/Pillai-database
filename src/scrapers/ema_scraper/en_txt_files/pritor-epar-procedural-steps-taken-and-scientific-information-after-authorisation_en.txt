are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

as several patients that developed hypoglycemia were 
treated with antidiabetics or insulin, the MAH was 
requested to include a warning to be added in section 4.4 
of SmPC in order to advise caution in patient diabetic 
treated with antidiabetics or insulin. Based on the cases

should be added to advise caution also in patients with 
uncontrolled blood pressure.

the SPC, upon request by CHMP following the assessment 
of PSUR 9, to add further information about 'liver disorder' 
and to add the ADR 'hypoglycaemia' under post-marketing 
experience.  
Most cases of abnormal liver function / liver disorder from 
post-marketing experience occurred in Japanese patients. 
The product information has now been updated to reflect 
the fact that Japanese patients are more likely to 
experience these adverse reactions.  
Post-marketing experience with telmisartan has identified 
hypoglycaemia as a new side effect which occurs mainly in 
diabetic patients and patients with abnormal glucose 
tolerance. Based on the statistically significant number of 
hypoglycaemia reports from pooled clinical trials in 
hypertensive patients suffering from diabetes, and the 
cardiovascular outcome trial TRANSCEND, a direct causal 
relationship between the occurrence of hypoglycaemia in 
diabetic patients and the therapeutic use of telmisartan 
cannot be excluded.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make changes 
to the SPC to bring it in line with the latest version of the 
SPC guideline. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.

Strokes" (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 years and older,

sepsis was noted for telmisartan compared with placebo, 
0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 
1.00 - 2.06)]; the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was 
increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. 
patients taking placebo (0.16 %) [RR 2.07 (95 % 
confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased 
occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of 
telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a 
mechanism not currently known. The term "sepsis including

CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling 
relating to the use of Angiotensin II Receptor 
have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but

Furthermore, minor typographical changes have 
been introduced to SPC section 4.4. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the 
PL. 
Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has 
been deleted.

Cooper's study published in the NEJM in June 2006 
4.3, 4.4, and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to 
implement the CHMP recommendation on a 
harmonised labelling relating to the use of ACE 
inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists 
during pregnancy. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
identified a signal of increased risk of congenital 
malformations, particularly cardiac defects after exposure 
to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and 
hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the 
available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is 
not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such 
exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be 
avoided. 
There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd 
trimester of pregnancy remained, but a harmonised 
wording regarding pregnancy across the class was

NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and 
antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the 
antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II antagonists. 
In some patients with compromised renal function (eg 
dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised 
renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II 
antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may 
result in further deterioration of renal function, including 
possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Therefore the combination should be administered with 
caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be 
adequately hydrated and consideration shoul be given to 
monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant 
therapy and periodically thereafter." 
In addition, minor changes have been introduced in the 
wording of the subsections on "lithium", "medicinal 
products that may increase potassium levels or induce 
hyperkalaemia", "alcohol and antidepressants. 
Regarding section 4.4, a number of cross-references have 
been introduced, as well as the following sentence on 
fructose intolerance, in line with the Guideline on 
Excipients: 
Sorbitol: Patients with hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take Pritor.

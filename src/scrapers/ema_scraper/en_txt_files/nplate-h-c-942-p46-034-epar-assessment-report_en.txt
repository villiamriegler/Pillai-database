1.  Introduction 
On 7th February 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric (study 20101221) for romiplostim 
(Nplate), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of an agreed paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-000653-PIP01-
09-M05) for Nplate, approved by the EMA on 11th August 2017 (Decision P/0233/2017). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to 
other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be 
administered subcutaneously once a week. 
On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic 
immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  
On 9th November 2017, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on an extension of indication application 
for Nplate (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G) to include paediatric chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients: 1 year of age and older. At the time (5 
December 2016) of the submission of this variation application, the MAH submitted 3 completed 
studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were placebo controlled, and study 20030213, which 
was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing studies (studies 20090340 and 20101221, 
which are both long term safety and efficacy studies). 
The MAH stated that study 20101221 – “A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy and Safety 
Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)” 
is a stand alone study, and is also part of a clinical development program.  
The hereby submitted study 20101221 is also part of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for 
romiplostim (Nplate) targeted to grant indications for the treatment of chronic immune 
thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; ITP) in paediatric patients who are refractory 
or intolerant to other treatments (e.g., glucocorticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy) (EMA 
Decision number P/0233/2017; PIP number EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). The following table

Assessor’s comments: 
Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to 
other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be 
administered subcutaneously once a week. 
On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic 
immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). At the time (5 December 2016) of the 
submission of the variation application EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G to grant the extension of 
indication to include paediatric population (1 year of age and older) for Nplate, the MAH submitted 3 
completed studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were placebo controlled, and study 
20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing studies (studies 
20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy studies).  
Studies 20080279, 20090340 and 20101221 are measures of the agreed European Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) for Nplate (P/0233/2017; EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). Please, take into 
account that the outcome date of the compliance report (EMEA-C-000653-PIP01-09-M05) on the 
agreed PIP was 27th March 2020. 
Study 20101221 agrees with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, as regards of 
its submission to the competent authority within six months of completion. Study 20090340 has 
been submitted to the EMA in procedure EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G. 
Furthermore, the MAH has not provided information regarding the need for submitting a variation 
application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing studies not yet completed at 
the time of granting the paediatric indication). In order to increase the availability of information on 
the use of romiplostim in the paediatric ITP population (approx. prevalence of 7.2 cases per 100,000 
per year), and considering that the already completed studies 20090340 and 20101221 are also part 
of an agreed PIP for Nplate, the MAH is requested to apply for a variation to update the summary of 
product characteristics by reflecting the main results of these studies as soon as possible (please, 
see Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation). 
 
  
 
 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently authorised in the European Union to be used in patients one year of 
age and older as 125 micrograms, 250 micrograms and 500 micrograms powder for solution for 
injection. 
Study 20101221 was performed by administering romiplostim subcutaneously once per week as the 
authorized formulation developed for use in paediatric population (please, see Assessment Report for 
Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G). 
Nplate 125 micrograms powder for solution for injection is supplied for single use in a 3 mL glass vial 
containing 230 micrograms of romiplostim, providing 125 micrograms of deliverable romiplostim.  
The qualitative and quantitative composition for Nplate 125 micrograms vial is presented in Table 1 
below.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The buffer 
formulation used for manufacture of the 125 micrograms presentation is the same as that used for 
Nplate 250 micrograms and 500 micrograms. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Romiplostim (Nplate) is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular 
transcriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production.  
Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is currently approved by the European Commission for 
chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for 
injection to be administered subcutaneously once a week.   
Nplate 250 μg and 500 μg powder for solution for injection are indicated for adult chronic immune 
(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). The initial dose of romiplostim is 1 microgram/kg based on actual 
body weight.  
In children and adults, the initial dose of romiplostim is 1 microgram/kg based on actual body weight. 
In children, the volume of romiplostim to administer is calculated based on body weight, dose required, 
and concentration of product. The once weekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments 
of 1 microgram/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥50 x 10^9/L. Platelet counts should be 
assessed weekly until a stable platelet count (≥50 x 10^9/L for at least 4 weeks without dose 
 
 
 
 
adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should be assessed monthly thereafter. A maximum 
once weekly dose of 10 micrograms/kg should not be exceeded. 
 The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study 20101221: A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study of 
Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study 20101221 - “A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy 
and Safety Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects 
With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)” 
Description 
Study 20101221 was a phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study to describe the percentage 
of time paediatric subjects with ITP had a platelet response while receiving romiplostim. A platelet 
response was defined as having a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9L in the absence of ITP rescue 
medications in the past 4 weeks. This study also includes a protocol supplement to implement bone 
marrow evaluations. Romiplostim was administered to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP 
diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) 
or were ineligible for other ITP therapies.

Study design 
This phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study was designed to evaluate the percentage of 
time paediatric subjects with ITP had a response, defined as a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L in the 
absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks, while receiving romiplostim. This study also 
includes a protocol supplement to implement bone marrow evaluations. Romiplostim was administered 
to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at 
least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies. 
The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, up to 3-year treatment period, an end-of-treatment 
(EOT) visit, and an end-of-study (EOS) visit (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Study Design and Treatment Schema – Main Protocol 
Romiplostim was administered weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Dose adjustment rules were 
based on individual platelet counts. The maximum permitted dose of romiplostim was 10 
micrograms/kg.  
Subjects who reduced their romiplostim dose, no longer required ITP medications (concomitant or 
rescue), or had an onset of a sustained platelet response (defined as consecutive platelet counts of 
≥50 x 10^9/L) were monitored for at least 6 months beginning with the first platelet count of ≥50 x 
10^9/L. 
Subjects whose platelet count remained ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of any medications for ITP for at 
least 6 months were followed every 12 weeks for the duration of the 36-month treatment period. If 
during the 36-month treatment period a subject’s platelet count subsequently fell below 50 x 10^9/L, 
treatment with romiplostim at the initial starting dose could be resumed per the protocol. 
Subjects who had a platelet count of ≤20 x 10^9/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the maximum 
romiplostim dose of 10 micrograms/kg discontinued romiplostim and were considered non-responders. 
A subset of at least 60 subjects was enrolled sequentially into the following cohorts of protocol 
supplement for the EU, Switzerland, and Turkey: 
• 
• 
bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at baseline and year 1 
bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at baseline and year 2 
 
 
 
 
Once the first cohort completed enrolment, the second cohort began enrolling. All subjects in the 2 
cohorts were to receive romiplostim for 3 years, unless withdrawn from the study early. Subjects 
completed an EOT visit at the conclusion of their treatment period and returned for an EOS visit (see 
Figure 2). 
Figure 2. Study Design and Treatment Schema - Bone Marrow Biopsy Evaluation 
A baseline bone marrow biopsy and aspirate were required to determine eligibility; this could either 
have been a bone marrow biopsy within 1 year before planned first dose of romiplostim (with available 
bone marrow tissue block or a minimum of 5 unstained, evaluable histological slides to send to a 
central laboratory) or a pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy and aspirate within 3 weeks before planned 
first dose of romiplostim. A further bone marrow biopsy and aspirate was required at year 1 (day 365) 
or year 2 (day 720) (+ 4-week window), depending on cohort in which the subject was enrolled. The 
study schemas are provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above. 
Study population /Sample size 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility 
Eligible paediatric subjects diagnosed with ITP for at least 6 months according to the American Society 
of Haematology guidelines who had thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of ≤30 x 10^9/L) or 
bleeding that was uncontrolled with conventional therapy within 4 weeks of enrolment. 
Subjects had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be included into the bone marrow 
biopsy analysis: 
•  Subject must have agreed to a scheduled bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at year 1 or year 2 
after romiplostim treatment and any unscheduled biopsies if clinically indicated. 
•  Subjects must have had a reticulin grade of 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to the modified 
Bauermeister grading scale, as assessed by central laboratory from a bone marrow biopsy 
performed within 1 year before planned first dose of romiplostim or consent to a pre-treatment 
bone marrow biopsy and aspirate before planned first dose of romiplostim. 
Number of Subjects Planned 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 20101221 was planned to include approximately 200 subjects. Of these, at least 30 subjects 
were to be enrolled into each of the 2 cohorts identified by bone marrow biopsy time points (year 1 or 
year 2). 
Treatments  
Dosage, treatment regimen, route of administration 
This was a single-arm, open-label study, where romiplostim was administered weekly by subcutaneous 
(SC) injection at the starting dose of 1.0 micrograms/kg. Dose adjustment rules were based on 
individual platelet counts.  
Intra-individual, weekly dose adjustment by 1 microgram/kg: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
platelets <50 x 10^9/L: increase; 
platelets 50 to 200 x 10^9/L: no change; 
platelets 200 to <400 x10^9/L for two consecutive weeks: reduce; 
platelets >/=400 x 10^9/L: withhold and reduce on next dosing when platelets <200 x 
10^9/L. 
The maximum permitted dose of romiplostim was 10 micrograms/kg.  
Duration of Treatment 
The maximum study duration (for a subject completing the study) was approximately 3 years and 2 
months: a 4-week screening period, up to 36-month treatment period, an EOT visit, and an EOS visit.

Statistical Methods 
No formal hypothesis was tested. Summary statistics was provided for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. Categorical data were presented in the form of number and percentage. Continuous data 
were provided with the descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, Q1 [25th percentile], Q3 [75th 
percentile], minimum, and maximum).  
The analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints was based on the set of subjects receiving at least 1 dose 
of romiplostim. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
At the time of this final analysis (database snapshot date 23 October 2019), all 203 subjects (100%) 
enrolled in the study across 3 age groups received at least 1 dose of romiplostim and were included in 
the Full Analysis Set (see Table 1). Of these, 108 subjects (53.2%) completed romiplostim and 95 
subjects (46.8%) discontinued romiplostim. The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation 
was lack of efficacy (43 subjects [21.2%]). 
A total of 109 subjects (53.7%) completed the study; 94 subjects (46.3%) discontinued the study (see 
Table 1). The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was protocol-specified criteria (67 
subjects [33.0%]). 
Table 1. Subject Disposition With Discontinuation Reason by Age Groups (Full Analysis Set) 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 79 subjects were enrolled into the protocol supplement for the EU, Switzerland, and Turkey 
(see Table 2). Of these, 30 subjects were in cohort 1 (bone marrow samples taken at baseline and 
year 1) and 49 subjects were in cohort 2 (bone marrow samples taken at baseline and year 2). 
Table 2. Subjects With Bone Marrow Biopsy Data (Full Analysis Set - Subjects Recruited Under the EU, 
Switzerland, and Turkey Supplement) 
Baseline data 
The distribution of boys (100 subjects; 49.3%) and girls (103 subjects; 50.7%) was similar in the Full 
Analysis Set. 
Most patients (164 subjects; 80.8%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 9.5 (4.4) years overall. 
Subjects were stratified into 1 of the 3 age groups as below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  ≥1 to <6 years (49 subjects [24.1%]) 
•  ≥6 to <12 years (81 subjects [39.9%]) 
•  ≥12 to <18 years (73 subjects [36.0%]) 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between subjects enrolled in cohort 1 
and cohort 2 and between subjects enrolled in the protocol supplement and those enrolled in the main 
protocol. Baseline Bone Marrow characteristics of subjects in the protocol supplement are showed 
below (see Table 3). 
Table 3. Baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Results (Full Analysis Set - Subjects Recruited Under the EU, 
Switzerland, and Turkey Supplement) 
Efficacy and safety results 
Efficacy endpoints were assessed using the Efficacy Analysis Set that included all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of romiplostim (N=203). 
 
 
 
Primary Endpoints 
Percentage of time with a platelet response in the first 6 months 
All 203 subjects had at least 1 post-baseline platelet count. The mean (SD) and median percentage of 
time with a platelet response (platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L) within the first 6 months of initiation of 
romiplostim without rescue medication use for the past 4 weeks was 50.57% (37.01) and 50.0%, 
respectively (see Table 4). The median percentage of time with a platelet response was 50.0%, 
33.33%, and 66.67% for subjects in ≥1 to <6 years, ≥6 to <12 years, and ≥12 to <18 years age 
groups, respectively. 
Table 4. Percentage of Time With A Platelet Response in the First 6 Months After Initiation of 
Romiplostim (Efficacy Analysis Set) 
Incidence of Changes in Bone Marrow Biopsy: developed collagen, an increased Bauermeister grade by 
≥2 grades or an increase to grade 4 and bone marrow abnormalities 
•  Subjects who developed collagen 
Of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, no subjects developed collagen (a 
grade of 4 on the modified Bauermeister grading scale). No subjects developed collagen at cohort-
defined biopsies. 
•  Subjects who developed an increased Bauermeister grade by ≥2 grades or an increase to 
grade 4 
Of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 1 of 27 subjects (3.7%) in cohort 1 
(no subject in cohort 2) developed an increased modified Bauermeister grade by ≥2 severity grades 
(from grade 0 baseline value to grade 2 postbaseline value). 
•  Subjects who developed bone marrow abnormalities (overall interpretation of bone marrow 
biopsy and aspirate samples, cytogenetics, and FISH data) 
No subjects developed a bone marrow abnormality that was not consistent with an underlying 
diagnosis of ITP. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Percentage of time with a platelet response over the study duration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet response (platelet count of ≥50 x 
10^9/L) without rescue medication use within the past 4 weeks for the overall treatment period (week 
2 to EOT) was 60.82% (35.65) and 78.21%, respectively. The mean (SD) percentage of time with a 
platelet response was similar for ≥1 to <6 years (57.21% [36.46]) and ≥6 to <12 years (55.63% 
[38.31]) age groups, and was higher in the ≥12 to <18 years (68.99% [30.68]) age group. 
Overall, the number of subjects who had at least 1 platelet response from week 2 to EOS was 179 
subjects (88.2%) and was similar in ≥1 to <6 years (42 of 49 subjects [85.7%]) and ≥6 to <12 years 
(68 of 81 subjects [84.0%]) age groups, and was higher in ≥12 to <18 years (69 of 73 subjects 
[94.5%]) age group. Analysis of platelet response rate over time showed that the overall percentage of 
subjects with a platelet response at week 2 was 23.2%. The total response rate increased over time on 
study overall and across all age groups. 
Increase in platelet count of ≥20 x 10^9/L above baseline over the study duration 
The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥20 x 10^9/L from baseline 
without rescue medication use for ITP in the past 4 weeks was 64.16% (33.82) and 80.13%, 
respectively. The mean (SD) percentage of time was similar in ≥1 to <6 years (61.67% [35.54]) and 
≥6 to <12 years (59.92% [36.24]) age groups, and was higher in ≥12 to <18 years (70.55% [29.03]) 
age group. 
Use of rescue ITP medications 
Sixty subjects (29.6%) overall received rescue medication during the treatment period (week 2 to 
EOT). The incidence of subjects using rescue medications was higher in ≥1 to <6 years (23 of 49 
subjects [46.9%]) age group than in ≥6 to <12 years (23 of 81 subjects [28.4%]) and ≥12 to <18 
years (14 of 73 subjects [19.2%]) age groups. The most frequently used rescue medication by 
category was corticosteroids (19.2%) followed by Ig (17.2%). The incidence of subjects using rescue 
medication during the sequential 12-week periods (weeks 1 to 12, weeks >12 to 24, weeks >24 to 36) 
decreased over time in all 3 age groups. 
Anti-romiplostim Antibody Assays  
Subjects were tested for the presence (at baseline) or development (postbaseline) of romiplostim 
(including TPO mimetic peptide, the peptide component of romiplostim) and TPO antibodies. 
Seventeen subjects (8.4%) had a positive binding non-neutralizing antibody response against 
romiplostim while on study. Of these, 2 subjects had positive binding antibody status at or before 
baseline (pre-existing). 
Fifteen subjects (7.7%) developed post-baseline binding antibodies to romiplostim with a negative or 
no result at baseline. Of these, 7 had a transient binding antibody response with a negative result at 
the subjects’ last time point tested within the study period. 
Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive result for neutralizing antibody response against romiplostim 
while on study. None of these subjects were positive for neutralizing antibodies at or before baseline; 
all subjects developed neutralizing antibodies post-baseline. Of these, 4 had a transient neutralizing 
antibody response with a negative result at the subjects’ last time point tested within the study period. 
Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive binding, non-neutralizing antibody response against TPO while 
on study. Of these, 2 subjects had positive binding antibody status at or before baseline (pre-existing). 
Five subjects (2.6%) developed post-baseline binding non-neutralizing antibody response with a 
negative or no result at baseline. Of these 5 subjects, 4 had transient binding antibody response with a 
negative result at the subjects’ last time point tested within the study period. 
 
One subject (0.5%) had a postbaseline positive result for neutralizing antibody response against TPO 
(negative for antiromiplostim antibodies) while on study with negative or no result at baseline. The 
subject showed a transient antibody response with a negative result at the subject’s last time point 
tested within the study period. 
Subjects who developed increased reticulin 
Of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 5 of 27 subjects (18.5%) in cohort 1 
(95% exact binomial CI: 6.3, 38.1) and 17 of 36 subjects (47.2%) in cohort 2 (95% exact binomial CI: 
30.4, 64.5) developed increased reticulin (any increase from baseline in the modified Bauermeister 
grade). 
Subjects without an evaluable baseline result were assumed to have a baseline modified Bauermeister 
score of 0. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Sustained platelet response 
Eleven subjects (5.4%) had a sustained platelet response (consecutive platelet counts of ≥50 x 
10^9/L in the absence of any ITP medications for at least 24 weeks). The incidence of sustained 
platelet response was 10.2% (5 of 49 subjects) for ≥1 to <6 years, 2.5% (2 of 81 subjects) for ≥6 to 
<12 years, and 5.5% (4 of 73 subjects) for ≥12 to <18 years age groups. Overall, the mean (SD) time 
to onset of sustained platelet response was 57.1 (36.0) weeks. 
Incidence of splenectomy 
A total of 193 subjects entered the study as non-splenectomized. Three of 193 subjects (1.6%) 
underwent splenectomy during the study. The incidence of splenectomy during the study was 0% (0 of 
47 subjects) for ≥1 to <6 years, 2.6% (2 of 77 subjects) for ≥6 to <12 years, and 1.4% (1 of 69 
subjects) for ≥12 to <18 years age groups. 
Incidence of romiplostim self-administration 
A total of 138 subjects (68.0%) started self-administration of romiplostim during the overall treatment 
period and 101 subjects (49.8%) ended the study on self-administration of romiplostim. 
Safety endpoints 
Analysis of safety endpoints was done using the Safety Analysis Set that included all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of romiplostim (N=203). 
Extent of exposure 
All 203 subjects enrolled in the study received at least 1 dose of romiplostim and were included in the 
Safety Analysis Set. Overall, the median (range) duration of treatment was 155.9 (8.0, 163.0) weeks, 
total number of non-zero doses was 123.0 (8.0, 158.0) micrograms/kg, and the most frequent dose 
received by subjects during the treatment period was 10.0 (0, 11.0) micrograms/kg. The median 
(range) cumulative dose received by subjects during the treatment period was 22 655 (400, 185 335) 
micrograms and the average weekly dose was 6.92 (0.1, 9.7) micrograms/kg. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
A total of 193 subjects (95.1%) overall had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (unless 
specified otherwise, the term adverse events refers to treatment-emergent adverse events). Adverse 
events by preferred term reported for ≥20% of subjects were epistaxis (80 subjects [39.4%]), 
 
 
headache (78 subjects [38.4%]), nasopharyngitis (75 subjects [36.9%]), pyrexia (65 subjects 
[32.0%]), cough (52 subjects [25.6%]), petechiae (48 subjects [23.6%]), vomiting (47 subjects 
[23.2%]), and hematoma (42 subjects [20.7%]). 
The subject incidence of adverse events for ≥1 to <6 years, ≥6 to <12 years, and ≥12 to <18 years 
age groups was 93.9% (46 of 49 subjects), 95.1% (77 of 81 subjects), and 95.9% (70 of 73 subjects), 
respectively. Adverse events with the highest subject incidence in ≥1 to <6 years age group were 
pyrexia (25 of 49 subjects [51.0%]) followed by cough (23 of 49 subjects [46.9%]). Adverse events 
with the highest subject incidence in ≥6 to <12 years age group were epistaxis (36 of 81 subjects

incidence in ≥12 to <18 years age group were headache (33 of 73 subjects [45.2%]) followed by 
nasopharyngitis (30 of 73 subjects [41.1%]). 
Subject incidence of individual preferred terms for adverse events was variable across age groups, with 
preferred terms reported overall at ≥5% subject incidence generally occurring at a higher subject 
incidence in the younger (≥1 to <6 and ≥6 to <12 years) age groups. 
•  Contusion, cough, decreased platelet count, diarrhoea, ear infection, ecchymosis, fall, 
gastroenteritis, mouth haemorrhage, nasal congestion, petechiae, pyrexia, rash, rhinitis, 
rhinorrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting occurred at a higher subject 
incidence in ≥1 to <6 years age group than in ≥6 to <12 and ≥12 to <18 years age groups.

groups. 
•  Arthralgia, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity, influenza, nasopharyngitis, 
oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and skin laceration occurred at a 
higher subject incidence in ≥12 to <18 years age group than in ≥1 to <6 and ≥6 to <12 years 
age groups. 
Adverse events by severity 
Most subjects (127 [62.6%]) had mild or moderate adverse events. A total of 57 subjects (28.1%) had 
grade 3 adverse events and 19 subjects (9.4%) had grade 4 adverse events.  
The grade 3 adverse events by preferred term reported for ≥3 subjects were epistaxis (9 subjects 
[4.4%]); decreased platelet count (7 subjects [3.4%]); headache (6 subjects [3.0%]); 
thrombocytopenia (4 subjects [2.0%]); and abdominal pain, pain in extremity, and upper respiratory 
tract infection (3 subjects [1.5%] each). 
The grade 4 adverse events by preferred term reported for >1 subject were decreased platelet count 
(9 subjects [4.4%]) and thrombocytopenia (5 subjects [2.5%]). 
Treatment-related adverse events 
Adverse events considered by the site investigator to be related to romiplostim were reported for 56 
subjects (27.6%).  
Treatment-related adverse events by preferred term reported for >2 subjects were headache (20 
subjects [9.9%]); nausea (7 subjects [3.4%]); neutralizing antibody positive (6 subjects [3.0%]); 
 
 
arthralgia, pain in extremity, and petechiae (5 subjects [2.5%] each); abdominal pain and injection 
site reaction (4 subjects [2.0%] each); and myalgia and rash (3 subjects [1.5%] each). 
Exposure-adjusted adverse events 
When adverse events were adjusted for duration, the total number of adverse events and the duration-
adjusted event rate was 4.433 (1017.8 per 100 subject-years).  
Adverse events with the highest duration-adjusted event rate (per 100 subject-years) overall were: 
contusion (84.0), epistaxis (77.1), and headache (77.1).  
The duration-adjusted event rate (per 100 subject-years) for adverse events by preferred term was 
higher in ≥1 to <6 years age group (1175.4) than in ≥6 to <12 (1073.8) and ≥12 to <18 (866.4) 
years age groups. 
Withdrawals from investigational product due to adverse events 
Fifteen subjects (7.4%) had adverse events leading to withdrawal of romiplostim. Of these: 
•  4 subjects had treatment-related neutralizing antibodies positive that were serious for 3 
subjects (grade 3 [1 subject], grade 1 [2 subjects]) and nonserious for 1 subject (grade 1). 
•  3 subjects had systematic lupus erythematosus that was not considered treatment related and 
was serious in 1 subject (grade 3) and nonserious in 2 subjects (grade 2 [1 subject], grade 3 
[1 subject]).  
•  2 subjects had neutralizing antibodies that were nonserious (grade 2 [1 subject], grade 1 [1 
subject]) and was considered treatment related in 1 subject.

each). 
Deaths 
No fatal adverse events occurred during the study. 
Events of interest 
For adverse events of interest, reported preferred terms were compared against a list of predefined 
preferred terms. The most frequently reported adverse events of interest were pulmonary disorders 
 
 
 
 
 
(Amgen Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] query [AMQ]) (168 subjects [82.8%]), 
events from the haemorrhages standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) (141 subjects [69.5%]), and events 
from the hypersensitivity/angioedema/anaphylactic reactions/anaphylactic-anaphylactoid shock 
conditions SMQs (69 subjects [34.0%]). No events of angioedema or anaphylaxis were reported. 
The most frequently reported (>10 subjects) haemorrhage adverse events were epistaxis (80 subjects 
[39.4%]), petechiae (48 subjects [23.6%]), hematoma (42 subjects [20.7%]), contusion (40 subjects 
[19.7%]), gingival bleeding (21 subjects [10.3%]), ecchymosis (20 subjects [9.9%]), and mouth 
haemorrhage (17 subjects [8.4%]). The grade ≥3 adverse events identified by the SMQ search for 
haemorrhage were reported for 20 subjects (9.9%). The grade ≥3 adverse events reported for >1 
subject were epistaxis (9 subjects [4.4%]); immune thrombocytopenic purpura (3 subjects [1.5%]); 
and contusion and ecchymosis (2 subjects [1.0%] each). 
Concurrent hematopoietic erythropenia (SMQ) and leukocytosis (AMQ) events were reported for 24 
subjects (11.8%) (Hematopoietic erythropenia and leukocytosis was defined by MedDRA terms or 
laboratory values. Hematopoietic erythropenia was identified when haemoglobin level was lower limit 
of normal, which was age- and sex-dependent, and leukocytosis was identified when white blood cell 
count was >11 x 10^9/L. A concurrent event was defined as both hematopoietic erythropenia and 
leukocytosis events that occurred within a 4-week window). 
Immunogenicity events (AMQ) were reported for 9 subjects (4.4%), renal and urinary disorders 
system organ class (AMQ) events were reported for 8 subjects (3.9%), cardiac disorders (SMQs) were 
reported 4 subjects (2.0%), malignancies (SMQ) were reported for 2 subjects (1.0%), drug-related 
hepatic disorders (SMQ) were reported for 1 subject (0.5%), haematological malignant 
tumors/haematological tumors of unspecified malignancy/myelodysplastic syndrome (SMQs) were 
reported for 1 subject (0.5%), thrombocytosis (AMQ) was reported for 1 subject (0.5%), and 
thrombotic/thromboembolic events (SMQs) were reported for 1 subject (0.5%). 
Anti-romiplostim antibodies 
Seventeen subjects (8.4%) had a positive binding non-neutralizing antibody response against 
romiplostim while on study. Of these, 15 subjects (7.7%) developed postbaseline binding antibodies to 
romiplostim with a negative or no result at baseline. 
Seven of 15 subjects had a transient binding antibody response with a negative result at the subjects’ 
last time point tested within the study period. 
Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive result for neutralizing antibody response against romiplostim 
while on study. None of these subjects were positive for neutralizing antibodies at or before baseline; 
all subjects developed neutralizing antibodies postbaseline. Of these, 4 had a transient neutralizing 
antibody response with a negative result at the subjects’ last time point tested within the study period. 
Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive binding, non-neutralizing antibody response against TPO while 
on study. Of these, 5 subjects (2.6%) developed postbaseline binding non-neutralizing antibody 
response with a negative or no result at baseline. 
Four of 5 subjects had transient binding antibody response with a negative result at the subjects’ last 
time point tested within the study period. 
One subject (0.5%) had a postbaseline positive result for neutralizing antibody response against TPO 
while on study (negative for anti-romiplostim antibodies) with negative or no result at baseline. The 
subject showed a transient antibody response with a negative result at the subject’s last time point 
tested within the study period. 
 
Clinical laboratory 
Maximum postbaseline grade ≥3 decreases were reported for haemoglobin (5 subjects), neutrophils (4 
subjects), platelets (199 subjects), and leukocytes (3 subjects). No postbaseline grade ≥3 increase in 
bilirubin or creatinine were reported. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Nplate is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other 
treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be 
administered subcutaneously once a week. 
On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic 
immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). On 9th November 2017, the CHMP issued a 
positive opinion on an extension of indication for Nplate (EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G) to include 
paediatric population (1 year of age and older). At the time (5 December 2016) of the submission of 
that variation application, the MAH submitted 3 completed studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, 
which were placebo controlled, and study 20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) 
and 2 ongoing studies (studies 20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy 
studies). 
The hereby submitted study (20101221) is also part of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for 
Nplate (P/0233/2017; EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). Agreed PIP includes a total of three clinical 
studies: 20080279, 20090340 and 20101221. 
Study 20101221 was a phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study where romiplostim was 
administered weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP 
diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) 
or were ineligible for other ITP therapies. Dose adjustment rules were based on individual platelet 
counts, being 10 micrograms/kg the maximum permitted dose of romiplostim. The study consisted of a 
4-week screening period, up to 3-year treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit, and an end-
of-study (EOS) visit. The primary objectives of study 20101221 were to describe the percentage of 
time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response in the first 6 months from the start of 
treatment with romiplostim as well as evaluating the incidence of changes in bone marrow findings at 
year 1 or year 2 after initial exposure to romiplostim. A platelet response was defined as having a 
platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks. 
Secondary objectives were to describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a 
platelet response over the study duration, the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP 
have an increase in platelet count ≥20 x 10^9/L above baseline over study duration, the use of rescue 
ITP medications, the incidence of antibody formation, the safety of romiplostim as a long-term 
treatment in paediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP and to evaluate the incidence of increased 
reticulin as evidenced by silver staining at year 1 or year 2, after initial exposure to romiplostim. In 
addition, it was proposed as exploratory objectives to describe the incidence of sustained platelet 
response, the incidence of splenectomy and the subject incidence of romiplostim self-administration.  
A total of 203 subjects were enrolled in the study across 3 age groups (≥1 to <6 years: 49 subjects 
[24.1%]; ≥6 to <12 years: 81 subjects [39.9%]; ≥12 to <18 years: 73 subjects [36.0%]). For 
evaluating the incidence of changes in bone marrow, a total of 79 subjects were enrolled sequentially 
into the protocol supplement for the EU, Switzerland, and Turkey. Of these, 30 subjects were in cohort 
 
1 (bone marrow samples [biopsy and aspirate] taken at baseline and year 1) and 49 subjects were in 
cohort 2 (bone marrow samples [biopsy and aspirate] taken at baseline and year 2).  
With respect to the primary endpoints, the mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet 
response within the first 6 months of initiation of romiplostim was 50.57% (37.01) and 50.0%, 
respectively. The median percentage of time with a platelet response was 50.0% for ≥1 to <6 age 
group, 33.33% for ≥6 to <12 age group, and 66.67% for ≥12 to <18 years age group. When the 
subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy (cohort 1: 27/30 subjects [90.0%] and 
cohort 2: 36/49 subjects [73.5%]) were evaluate, no subjects developed collagen (a grade of 4 on the 
modified Bauermeister grading scale), 1/27 subjects (3.7%) in cohort 1 developed an increased 
modified Bauermeister grade by ≥2 severity grades (from grade 0 baseline value to grade 2 post-
baseline value) and no subjects developed a bone marrow abnormality. Moreover, 5/27 subjects 
(18.5%) in cohort 1 (95% exact binomial CI: 6.3, 38.1) and 17/36 subjects (47.2%) in cohort 2 (95% 
exact binomial CI: 30.4, 64.5) developed increased reticulin (any increase from baseline in the 
modified Bauermeister grade).  
Regarding the safety results, a total of 193 subjects (95.1%) overall had at least 1 treatment-
emergent adverse event. Adverse events reported for ≥20% of subjects were epistaxis (39.4%), 
headache (38.4%), nasopharyngitis (36.9%), pyrexia (32.0%), cough (25.6%), petechiae (23.6%), 
vomiting (23.2%), and hematoma (20.7%). Fifteen subjects (7.4%) had adverse events leading to 
withdrawal of romiplostim. Serious adverse events were reported for 60 subjects (29.6%). No fatal 
adverse events were reported in the study. The most frequently reported adverse events of interest 
were pulmonary disorders (Amgen MedDRA query) (82.8%), events from the haemorrhages 
standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) (69.5%), and events from the hypersensitivity/ angioedema/ 
anaphylactic reactions/ anaphylactic-anaphylactoid shock conditions SMQs (34.0%). Fifteen subjects 
(7.7%) developed postbaseline binding antibodies to romiplostim with a negative or no result at 
baseline. Five subjects (2.6%) developed postbaseline binding non-neutralizing antibody response 
against TPO with a negative or no result at baseline.  
Study 20101221 agrees with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, as regards of its 
submission to the competent authority within six months of completion. Study 20090340 has been 
submitted as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G .  
In summary, study 20101221 has been adequately designed and completed in accordance (EMEA-C-
000653-PIP01-09-M05) to the agreed PIP. Regarding the submitted data on the primary endpoints, 
although results of percentage of time with a platelet response within the first 6 months of initiation of 
treatment were generally consistent with the known efficacy profile of romiplostim, study 20101221 
appears to be of particular interest since it provides information regarding long-term bone marrow 
effects in paediatric ITP subjects which has not been yet included in the EU summary product 
characteristics (SmPC). In view of the safety results, the overall safety profile of the paediatric 
subjects who received romiplostim in study 20101221 was similar to the known safety profile of 
romiplostim. 
The main limitation of the submitted study is the limited sample size, which makes challenging drawing 
any conclusion for the overall and, in particular, for the different age cohorts. Due to the difficulties to 
recruit paediatric ITP subjects (approx. prevalence 7.2 cases per 100,000 per year), this limitation is 
not posed as an objection. In this regard, it should be taken into account that Nplate was designated 
as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/05/283 from 27 May 2005 to February 2019 (at the end of the 
10-year period of market exclusivity) in the following indication: Treatment of idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura.  
In order to increase the availability of information on the use of romiplostim in the paediatric 
population suffering from this rare condition (ITP), the SmPC should be updated to also reflect the 
main results of the completed study 20101221. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study 20101221 has been submitted within six months of its completion and is part of the PIP EMEA-
000653-PIP01-09-M05 (P/0233/2017). The study has been adequately designed and completed in 
accordance (EMEA-C-000653-PIP01-09-M05) to the agreed PIP. On the light of the obtained results, it 
is considered of interest to conduct a formal benefit/risk evaluation in order to increase the availability 
of information on the use of romiplostim in the paediatric ITP population.   
Study 20090340 (also included in the agreed PIP) has been submitted as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G to the EMA.  
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding study 20101221, the MAH is requested to submit a variation in 
accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to update the summary of product 
characteristics by reflecting the main results not only from study 20101221 but also from study 
20090340, or provide a justification for not doing so.  
This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these 
conclusions.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Seebri Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is the inhalation of the content of one capsule once daily using the Seebri 
Breezhaler inhaler. 
Seebri Breezhaler is recommended to be administered, at the same time of the day each day. If a dose 
is missed, the next dose should be taken as soon as possible. Patients should be instructed not to take 
more than one dose in a day. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
Seebri Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (75 years of age and older) 
(see section 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
Seebri Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis 
Seebri Breezhaler should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk since the 
systemic exposure to glycopyrronium may be increased in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is 
predominantly cleared by renal excretion and therefore no major increase in exposure is expected in 
patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Seebri Breezhaler in the paediatric population (under 18 years) in the 
indication COPD. 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use only. 
The capsules must be administered only using the Seebri Breezhaler inhaler (see section 6.6). 
The capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. 
The capsules must not be swallowed. 
Patients should be instructed on how to administer the medicinal product correctly. Patients who do 
not experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicinal 
product rather than inhaling it. 
For instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Not for acute use 
Seebri Breezhaler is a once-daily, long-term maintenance treatment and is not indicated for the initial 
treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as a rescue therapy. 
Hypersensitivity 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Seebri Breezhaler. If 
signs suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing 
or swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips, and face), urticaria or skin rash, treatment should be 
discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
In clinical studies with Seebri Breezhaler, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed. However, 
paradoxical bronchospasm has been observed with other inhalation therapy and can be 
life-threatening. If this occurs, treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy 
instituted. 
Anticholinergic effect 
Seebri Breezhaler should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary 
retention. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma and 
should be informed to stop using Seebri Breezhaler and to contact their doctor immediately should any 
of these signs or symptoms develop. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with severe renal impairment 
A moderate mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold was seen in subjects 
with mild and moderate renal impairment and up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment 
and end-stage renal disease. In patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration 
rate below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, Seebri 
Breezhaler should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). 
These patients should be monitored closely for potential adverse reactions. 
Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease 
Patients with unstable ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, history of myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia (excluding chronic stable atrial fibrillation), a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc 
(Fridericia method) was prolonged (>450 ms for males or >470 ms for females) were excluded from 
the clinical trials, and therefore the experience in these patient groups is limited. Seebri Breezhaler 
should be used with caution in these patient groups. 
Excipients 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The co-administration of Seebri Breezhaler with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products 
has not been studied and is therefore not recommended. 
Although no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, Seebri Breezhaler has been used 
concomitantly with other medicinal products commonly used in the treatment of COPD without 
clinical evidence of drug interactions. These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, 
methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids. 
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, cimetidine, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is 
thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to 
glycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these 
changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when glycopyrronium is co-administered 
with cimetidine or other inhibitors of organic cation transport. 
Concomitant administration of glycopyrronium and orally inhaled indacaterol, a beta2-adrenergic 
agonist, under steady-state conditions of both active substances did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
either medicinal product. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Seebri Breezhaler in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Glycopyrronium should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether glycopyrronium bromide is excreted in human milk. However, glycopyrronium 
bromide (including its metabolites) was excreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The use 
of glycopyrronium by breast-feeding women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the 
woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant (see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
Reproduction studies and other data in animals do not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either 
males or females (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Glycopyrronium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common anticholinergic adverse reaction was dry mouth (2.4%). The majority of the reports 
of dry mouth were suspected to be related to the medicinal product and were mild, with none being 
severe. 
The safety profile is further characterised by other symptoms related to the anticholinergic effects, 
including signs of urinary retention, which were uncommon. Gastrointestinal effects including 
gastroenteritis and dyspepsia were also observed. Adverse reactions related to local tolerability 
included throat irritation, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported during the first six months of two pooled pivotal Phase III trials of 6 and 
12 months duration are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 1). Within each system organ 
class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In 
addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following 
convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

1) More frequent for glycopyrronium than placebo in the 12 months database only. 
2) Reports have been received from post-approval marketing experience in association with the use of 
Seebri Breezhaler. These were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and it is 
therefore not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to 
drug exposure. Therefore the frequency was calculated from clinical trial experience. 
3) Seen more frequently for glycopyrronium than placebo in elderly >75 years only. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In the pooled 6-month database the frequency of dry mouth was 2.2% versus 1.1%, of insomnia 1.0% 
versus 0.8%, and of gastroenteritis 1.4% versus 0.9%, for Seebri Breezhaler and placebo respectively. 
Dry mouth was reported mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with a median duration of four 
weeks in the majority of patients. However in 40% of cases symptoms continued for the entire 6-
month period. No new cases of dry mouth were reported in months 7-12. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
High doses of glycopyrronium may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms for which 
symptomatic treatment may be indicated. 
Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of Seebri Breezhaler capsules is unlikely due to the 
low oral bioavailability (about 5%). 
Peak plasma levels and total systemic exposure following intravenous administration of 
150 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide (equivalent to 120 micrograms glycopyrronium) in healthy 
volunteers were respectively about 50-fold and 6-fold higher than the peak and total exposure at 
steady-state achieved with the recommended dose (44 micrograms once daily) of Seebri Breezhaler 
and were well tolerated. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics, ATC code: 
R03BB06 
Mechanism of action 
Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for 
once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of COPD. Parasympathetic nerves are the major 
bronchoconstrictive neural pathway in airways, and cholinergic tone is the key reversible component 
of airflow obstruction in COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of 
acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways. 
Glycopyrronium bromide is a high affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist. A greater than 4-fold 
selectivity for the human M3 receptors over the human M2 receptor has been demonstrated using 
radioligand binding studies. It has a rapid onset of action as evidenced by observed receptor 
association/dissociation kinetic parameters and the onset of action after inhalation in clinical studies. 
The long duration of action can be partly attributed to sustained concentrations of active substance in 
the lung as reflected by the prolonged terminal elimination half-life of glycopyrronium after inhalation 
via the Seebri Breezhaler inhaler in contrast to the half life after intravenous administration (see 
section 5.2). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The clinical Phase III development programme included two phase III studies: a 6-month 
placebo-controlled study and a 12-month placebo and active-controlled (open label tiotropium 
18 micrograms once daily) study, both in patients with clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. 
Effects on lung function 
Seebri Breezhaler 44 micrograms once daily provided consistently statistically significant 
improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV1, forced vital capacity, 
FVC, and inspiratory capacity, IC) in a number of clinical studies. In phase III studies, bronchodilator 
effects were seen within 5 minutes after the first dose and were maintained over the 24-hour dosing 
interval from the first dose. There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time in the 6- 
and 12-month studies. The magnitude of the effect was dependent on the degree of reversibility of 
airflow limitation at baseline (tested by administration of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist 
bronchodilator): Patients with the lowest degree of reversibility at baseline (<5%) generally exhibited 
a lower bronchodilator response than patients with a higher degree of reversibility at baseline (≥5%). 
At 12 weeks (primary endpoint), Seebri Breezhaler increased trough FEV1 by 72 ml in patients with 
the lowest degree of reversibility (<5%) and by 113 ml in those patients with a higher degree of 
reversibility at baseline (≥5%) compared to placebo (both p<0.05). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 6-month study, Seebri Breezhaler increased FEV1 after the first dose with an improvement of 
93 ml within 5 minutes and 144 ml within 15 minutes of dosing, compared to placebo (both p<0.001). 
In the 12-month study, the improvements were 87 ml at 5 minutes and 143 ml at 15 minutes (both 
p<0.001). In the 12-month study, Seebri Breezhaler produced statistically significant improvements in 
FEV1 compared to tiotropium in the first 4 hours after dosing on day 1 and at week 26, and 
numerically greater values for FEV1 in the first 4 hours after dosing than tiotropium at week 12 and 
week 52. 
The values for FEV1 at the end of the dosing interval (24 h post dose) were similar between the first 
dose and those seen after 1 year of dosing. At 12 weeks (primary endpoint), Seebri Breezhaler 
increased trough FEV1 by 108 ml in the 6-month study and by 97 ml in the 12-month study compared 
to placebo (both p<0.001). In the 12-month study, the improvement versus placebo for tiotropium was 
83 ml (p<0.001). 
Symptomatic outcomes 
Seebri Breezhaler administered at 44 micrograms once daily statistically significantly reduced 
breathlessness as evaluated by the Transitional Dyspnoea Index (TDI). In a pooled analysis of the 6- 
and 12-month pivotal studies a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients receiving Seebri 
Breezhaler responded with a 1 point or greater improvement in the TDI focal score at week 26 
compared to placebo (58.4% and 46.4% respectively, p<0.001). These findings were similar to those 
seen in patients receiving tiotropium, 53.4% of whom responded with 1 point or greater improvement 
(p=0.009 compared to placebo). 
Seebri Breezhaler once daily has also shown a statistically significant effect on health-related quality 
of life measured using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). A pooled analysis of the 
6- and 12-month pivotal studies found a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients 
receiving Seebri Breezhaler responded with a 4 point or greater improvement in SGRQ compared to 
placebo at week 26 (57.8% and 47.6% respectively, p<0.001). For patients receiving tiotropium, 
61.0% responded with a 4 point or greater improvement in SGRQ (p=0.004 compared to placebo). 
COPD exacerbations reduction 
COPD exacerbation data was collected in the 6- and 12–month pivotal studies. In both studies, the 
percentage of patients experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation (defined as requiring treatment 
with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalisation) was reduced. In the 6-month study, 
the percentage of patients experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation was 17.5% for Seebri 
Breezhaler and 24.2% for placebo (Hazard ratio: 0.69, p=0.023), and in the 12-month study it was 
32.8% for Seebri Breezhaler and 40.2% for placebo (Hazard ratio: 0.66, p=0.001). In a pooled analysis 
of the first 6 months of treatment in the 6- and 12-month studies, compared to placebo Seebri 
Breezhaler statistically significantly prolonged time to first moderate or severe exacerbation and 
reduced the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations (0.53 exacerbations/year versus 
0.77exacerbations /year, p<0.001). The pooled analysis also showed fewer patients treated with Seebri 
Breezhaler than with placebo experienced an exacerbation requiring hospitalisation (1.7% versus 
4.2%, p=0.003). 
Other effects 
Seebri Breezhaler once daily statistically significantly reduced the use of rescue medication 
(salbutamol) by 0.46 puffs per day (p=0.005) over 26 weeks and by 0.37 puffs per day (p=0.039) over 
52 weeks, compared to placebo for the 6- and 12-month studies, respectively. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a 3-week study where exercise tolerance was tested via cycle ergometer at submaximal (80%) 
workload (submaximal exercise tolerance test), Seebri Breezhaler, dosed in the morning, reduced 
dynamic hyperinflation and improved the length of time exercise could be maintained from the first 
dose onwards. On the first day of treatment inspiratory capacity under exercise was improved by 
230 ml and exercise endurance time was improved by 43 seconds (an increase of 10%) compared to 
placebo. After three weeks of treatment the improvement in inspiratory capacity with Seebri 
Breezhaler was similar to the first day (200 ml), exercise endurance time however had increased by 
89 seconds (an increase of 21%) compared to placebo. Seebri Breezhaler was found to decrease 
dyspnoea and leg discomfort when exercising as measured using Borg scales. Seebri Breezhaler also 
reduced dyspnoea at rest measured using the Transitional Dyspnoea Index. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects 
No change in mean heart rate or QTc interval was observed with Seebri Breezhaler in doses up to 
176 micrograms in COPD patients. In a thorough QT study in 73 healthy volunteers, a single inhaled 
dose of glycopyrronium 352 micrograms (8 times the therapeutic dose) did not prolong the QTc 
interval and slightly reduced heart rate (maximal effect -5.9 bpm; average effect over 
24 hours -2.8 bpm) when compared to placebo. The effect on heart rate and QTc interval of 
150 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide (equivalent to 120 micrograms glycopyrronium) 
administered intravenously was investigated in young healthy subjects. Peak exposures (Cmax) about 
50-fold higher than after inhalation of glycopyrronium 44 micrograms at steady state were achieved 
and did not result in tachycardia or QTc prolongation. A slight reduction in heart rate (mean difference 
over 24 h -2 bpm when compared to placebo), which is a known effect of low exposures to 
anticholinergic compounds in young healthy subjects, was observed. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Seebri 
Breezhaler in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral inhalation using the Seebri Breezhaler inhaler, glycopyrronium was rapidly absorbed 
and reached peak plasma levels at 5 minutes post dose. 
The absolute bioavailability of glycopyrromium inhaled via Seebri Breezhaler was estimated to be 
about 45% of the delivered dose. About 90% of systemic exposure following inhalation is due to lung 
absorption and 10% is due to gastrointestinal absorption. 
In patients with COPD, pharmacokinetic steady-state of glycopyrronium was reached within one week 
of the start of treatment. The steady-state mean peak and trough plasma concentrations of 
glycopyrronium for a 44 micrograms once-daily dosing regimen were 166 picograms/ml and 
8 picograms/ml, respectively. Steady-state exposure to glycopyrronium (AUC over the 24-hour dosing 
interval) was about 1.4- to 1.7-fold higher than after the first dose. 
Distribution 
After intravenous dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution of glycopyrronium was 83 litres and 
the volume of distribution in the terminal phase was 376 litres. The apparent volume of distribution in 
the terminal phase following inhalation was almost 20-fold larger, which reflects the much slower 
elimination after inhalation. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of glycopyrronium was 38% 
to 41% at concentrations of 1 to 10 nanograms/ml. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
In vitro metabolism studies showed consistent metabolic pathways for glycopyrronium bromide 
between animals and humans. Hydroxylation resulting in a variety of mono-and bis-hydroxylated 
metabolites and direct hydrolysis resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid derivative (M9) were 
seen. In vivo, M9 is formed from the swallowed dose fraction of inhaled glycopyrronium bromide. 
Glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of glycopyrronium were found in urine of humans after 
repeated inhalation, accounting for about 3% of the dose. 
Multiple CYP isoenzymes contribute to the oxidative biotransformation of glycopyrronium. Inhibition 
or induction of the metabolism of glycopyrronium is unlikely to result in a relevant change of systemic 
exposure to the active substance. 
In vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that glycopyrronium bromide has no relevant capacity to 
inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5, the 
efflux transporters MDR1, MRP2 or MXR, and the uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2. In vitro 
enzyme induction studies did not indicate a clinically relevant induction by glycopyrronium bromide 
for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, or for UGT1A1 and the transporters MDR1 and MRP2. 
Elimination 
After intravenous administration of [3H]-labelled glycopyrronium bromide to humans, the mean 
urinary excretion of radioactivity in 48 hours amounted to 85% of the dose. A further 5% of the dose 
was found in the bile. 
Renal elimination of parent drug accounts for about 60 to 70% of total clearance of systemically 
available glycopyrronium whereas non-renal clearance processes account for about 30 to 40%. Biliary 
clearance contributes to the non-renal clearance, but the majority of non-renal clearance is thought to 
be due to metabolism. 
Mean renal clearance of glycopyrronium following inhalation was in the range of 17.4 and 
24.4 litres/h. Active tubular secretion contributes to the renal elimination of glycopyrronium. Up to 
23% of the delivered dose was found in urine as parent drug. 
Glycopyrronium plasma concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner. The mean terminal 
elimination half-life was much longer after inhalation (33 to 57 hours) than after intravenous 
(6.2 hours) and oral (2.8 hours) administration. The elimination pattern suggests sustained lung 
absorption and/or transfer of glycopyrronium into the systemic circulation at and beyond 24 hours 
after inhalation. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In COPD patients both systemic exposure and total urinary excretion of glycopyrronium at 
pharmacokinetic steady state increased about dose-proportionally over the dose range of 44 to 
176 micrograms. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in COPD patients identified body weight and age as 
factors contributing to inter-patient variability in systemic exposure. Seebri Breezhaler 44 micrograms 
once daily can be safely used in all age and body weight groups. 
Gender, smoking status and baseline FEV1 had no apparent effect on systemic exposure. 
There were no major differences in total systemic exposure (AUC) between Japanese and Caucasian 
subjects following inhalation of glycopyrronium bromide. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data is 
available for other ethnicities or races. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Clinical studies have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is 
cleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion. Impairment of the hepatic 
metabolism of glycopyrronium is not thought to result in a clinically relevant increase of systemic 
exposure. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Renal impairment has an impact on the systemic exposure to glycopyrronium bromide. A moderate 
mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold was seen in subjects with mild and 
moderate renal impairment and up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment and end-stage 
renal disease. In COPD patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2) Seebri Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose. In 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage 
renal disease requiring dialysis, Seebri Breezhaler should only be used if the expected benefit 
outweighs the potential risk (see section 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. 
Effects attributable to the muscarinic receptor antagonist properties of glycopyrronium bromide 
included mild to moderate increases in heart rate in dogs, lens opacities in rats and, reversible changes 
associated with reduced glandular secretions in rats and dogs. Mild irritancy or adaptive changes in the 
respiratory tract were seen in rats. All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of 
those anticipated in humans. 
Glycopyrronium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits following inhalation administration. Fertility 
and pre- and post-natal development were not affected in rats. Glycopyrronium bromide and its 
metabolites did not significantly cross the placental barrier of pregnant mice, rabbits and dogs. 
Glycopyrronium bromide (including its metabolites) was excreted into the milk of lactating rats and 
reached up to 10-fold higher concentrations in the milk than in the blood of the dam. 
Genotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential for glycopyrronium 
bromide. Carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice using oral administration and in rats using 
inhalation administration revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity at systemic exposures (AUC) of 
approximately 53-fold higher in mice and 75-fold higher in rats than the maximum recommended dose 
of 44 micrograms once daily for humans.

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3c. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3c. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Seebri Breezhaler is and what it is used for 
What Seebri Breezhaler is 
This medicine contains an active substance called glycopyrronium bromide. This belongs to a group of 
medicines called bronchodilators. 
What Seebri Breezhaler is used for 
This medicine is used to make breathing easier for adult patients who have breathing difficulties due to 
a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
In COPD the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes breathing difficult. This medicine blocks 
the tightening of these muscles in the lungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. 
If you use this medicine once a day, it will help to reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Seebri Breezhaler 
Do not use Seebri Breezhaler 
- 
if you are allergic to glycopyrronium bromide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).

Talk to your doctor before using Seebri Breezhaler, if any of the following applies to you: 
- 
- 
- 
you have kidney problems. 
you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. 
you have difficulty passing urine. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During treatment with Seebri Breezhaler, stop taking this medicine and tell your doctor 
immediately: 
-

using Seebri Breezhaler (signs of bronchospasm). 
if you experience difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips or face, 
skin rash, itching and hives (signs of allergic reaction). 
if you experience eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured 
images in association with red eyes. These may be signs of an acute attack of narrow-angle 
glaucoma. 
- 
- 
Seebri Breezhaler is used as a maintenance treatment for your COPD. Do not use this medicine to treat 
a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents below the age of 18 years.

medicines. This includes medicines similar to Seebri Breezhaler used for your lung disease, such as 
ipratropium, oxitropium or tiotropium (so called anticholinergics). 
No specific side effects have been reported when Seebri Breezhaler has been used together with other 
medicines used to treat COPD such as reliever inhalers (e.g. salbutamol), methylxanthines (e.g. 
theophylline) and/or oral and inhaled steroids (e.g. prednisolone). 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
There are no data from the use of this medicine in pregnant women and it is not known whether the 
active substance of this medicine passes into human milk.

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3c. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3c. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

The switch from etelcalcetide to Mimpara and the 
appropriate wash out period has not been studied in 
patients. In patients who have discontinued etelcalcetide, 
Mimpara should not be initiated until at least three 
subsequent haemodialysis sessions have been completed, 
at which time serum calcium should be measured. Ensure 
serum calcium levels are within the normal range before 
Mimpara is initiated. 
Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC to provide 
additional information with reference to switching 
from etelcalcetide to Mimpara (cinacalcet), upon 
request by PRAC following the assessment of the 
etelcalcetide PSUR (dated 14 June 2018). Further, 
the term ‘silica, dental type’ has been replaced by 
‘Amorphous silicon dioxide’ in SmPC section 6.1. 
An updated RMP version 9.0 was provided as part of 
the application in order to align the RMP with the 
GVP Module V (template Rev 2) with consequential 
reclassification of existing safety concerns.

The objectives of this type II variation are to update the 
ADR 'back pain' and section 5.1 of the SmPC, based 
Product Information with information on the safety and the 
on the CSR from Study 20070277 and post-
marketing data, to incorporate new information 
relating to the use of Mimpara for reduction of 
hypercalcaemia in patients with primary HPT for 
efficacy supported by a new study (20070277) in primary 
HPT patients with mild to moderate hypercalcaemia, who 
were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy.  
Study 20070277 (N=67) demonstrated a significantly 
whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the 
higher frequency of normalisation of serum calcium (≤ 10.3 
basis of serum calcium levels, but in whom 
parathyroidectomy is not appropriate or 
contraindicated. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet, and to update the 
contact details for the local representative in Italy in 
the Package Leaflet.

mg/dl) in the primary HPT population treated with 
cinacalcet versus placebo (75.8% and 0%, respectively). 
The study did not include patients with severe 
hypercalcaemia (total serum calcium > 11.3 mg/dl and ≤ 
12.5 mg/dl), unlike the pivotal MA study 20000204 (s-
calcium > 12.5 mg/dL). The results for the secondary 
efficacy endpoint (≥ 1 mg/dl decrease from baseline in 
serum calcium) in the cinacalcet group were similar to the 
efficacy seen in the pivotal study (84.8% versus 88%, 
respectively). 
In a pooled analysis of PHPT studies, there was an 
imbalance in hemorrhagic events, 10 (9.3%) in the 
cinacalcet arm and 2 (2.5%) in the placebo arm, 
respectively. All these events were non-serious. 
Furthermore, there were 4 serious cases of hemorrhagic 
events in an open-label extension phase. There are also 16 
cases from post-marketing sources. This issue will be 
further assessed as part of future PSURs. 
The benefit-risk balance of Mimpara for the treatment of 
patients with primary HPT and hypercalcaemia remains 
positive.

SmPC) to incorporate new or revised information, within 
the special warnings and precautions for use, undesirable 
effects and pharmacodymanic properties sections as 
detailed below. 
These updates include revisions following the completion of 
Study 20050182, the long term study of cinacalcet in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis entitled 
“Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower 
Cardiovascular Events” (EVOLVE) and a subsequent 
additional review of data pertaining to hypocalcemia and 
neoplastic events. 
EVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower 
CardioVascular Events) was a randomized, double-blind 
clinical study evaluating cinacalcet HCl vs. placebo for the 
reduction of the risk of all-cause mortality and 
cardiovascular events in 3,883 patients with secondary HPT 
and CKD receiving dialysis. Data from the recently 
completed Study 20050182, taken together with analyses 
of postmarketing data, add to the existing body of clinical 
experience in a larger population with longer exposure 
time.  The overall benefit-risk balance for cinacalcet for the 
treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
maintenance dialysis therapy is considered to remain 
favourable. The MAH´s proposed changes to the SmPC are 
now considered acceptable by the CHMP.

questions provided, although there is no evidence of a

pharmacological effect of cinacalcet. Thus, information 
about this risk has been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC, 
where other secondary effects to hypocalcemia are listed: 
“Caution is advised in patients with other risk factors for QT 
prolongation such as patients with known congenital long

Study 20030227 was designed to evaluate the safety, 
Characteristics (SPC) with information regarding the 
pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet in paediatric 
patients (aged 6-17 years) with Chronic Kidney 
Disease (CKD) receiving dialysis following a single 15 
mg dose. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 
single 15-mg dose of cinacalcet in paediatric subjects 6 to 
17 years of age with CKD receiving dialysis. The results of 
the study showed that the mean AUC0-t and Cmax values 
following administration of a single 15 mg dose of 
cinacalcet for the combined paediatric cohorts (aged 6-17 
years) were within approximately 30% of the mean AUC0-t 
and Cmax values observed in a single study in healthy 
adults following administration of a single 30 mg dose of 
cinacalcet (Study 20060133). 
Due to the limited data in paediatric subjects, the potential 
for higher exposures in the lighter/younger relative to 
heavier/older paediatric subjects for a given dose of 
cinacalcet cannot be excluded.

Characteristics to reflect the data from the study 
20050226 using midazolam, demonstrating that the 
co-administration of cinacalcet would not  alter the 
pharmacokinetics of classes of drugs metabolised by

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
open-label, 2-period, 2 treatment, 2-sequence, crossover 
study in healthy volunteers. The results show no effect of 
cinacalcet on midazolam plasma concentrations indicating 
low inhibitory potential of cinacalcet on CYP3A4/5. These 
data suggest that cinacalcet would not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of those classes of drugs that are 
metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as certain 
immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine and 
tacrolimus.

The MAH submitted the Study 20000178 in patients with 
(SPC), sections 4.4 and 5.1, to reflect Safety data 
from the final analysis of Study 20000178, assessing 
the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in patients with 
chronic Kedney Disease (CKD) with secondary 
hygerparathyroidism, not on dialysis (CKD stage 3 
and 4 population). 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
secondary HPT and CKD not receiving dialysis. The efficacy 
results of this study were presented and they were in 
principle consistent with those previously submitted. Even if 
the current study was modified to reduce the incidence of 
hypocalcaemia, the incidence of low serum calcium 
concentrations remained in principle similar with that 
observed in previous studies. The events of hypocalcemia 
were predominantly asymptomatic laboratory findings 
without discernible clinical sequelae. Consequently section 
4.4 of the SPC was updated to include the warning for 
hypocalcaemia in patients not on dialysis compared with 
cinacalcet-treated CKD patients on dialysis. Section 5.1 of 
the SPC has been updated as well to include the 
information derived from the study 20000178 in patients 
with CKD and secondary HPT not undergoing dialysis.

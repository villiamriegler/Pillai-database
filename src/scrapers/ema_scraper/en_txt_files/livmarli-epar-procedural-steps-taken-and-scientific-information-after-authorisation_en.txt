SmPC 
Administration of maralixibat to rats resulted in no 
preclinical safety information based on final results 
from study MRX-NC-006, listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP. This is a 104-week oral gavage 
carcinogenicity study of maralixibat in Sprague 
Dawley Rats performed to evaluate the toxicity and 
increases in tumour incidences in the final data of the 
presented study. Based on the negative outcome of the rat 
carcinogenicity study and the overall weight of evidence, no 
carcinogenic risk is anticipated for patients and chapter 5.3 
SmPC has been updated accordingly. In addition, the 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

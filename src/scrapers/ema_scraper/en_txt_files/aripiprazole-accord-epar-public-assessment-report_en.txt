2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This Application for a marketing authorisation for Aripiprazole Accord concerns a generic medicinal product of 
the centrally authorised product Abilify, which, at the time of this report, was available as tablets (5 mg, 10 mg, 
15 mg and 30 mg), orodispersible tablets (10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg), oral solution (1 mg/ml) and solution for 
injection  (7.5  mg/ml).  Abilify  is  approved  for  treatment  of  schizophrenia  and  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I 
Disorder as well as the prevention of manic episodes as follows: 
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and 
older.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for 
the prevention  of  a new  manic episode  in adults who  experienced predominantly  manic episodes and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I 
Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older. 
Aripiprazole  is  a  quinolinone  derivative,  7-{4-[4-(2,  3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}-3,4-dihydro- 
2(1H)-quinolinone,  which  exerts  both  agonistic  and  antagonistic  activity  at  dopaminergic  and  serotonergic 
receptors, along with activities at other receptors.  The efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar I 
Disorder is thought to be mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 
5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.  
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 7/26 
 
  
  
  
For the treatment of schizophrenia, aripiprazole is given in an initial oral dose of 10 or 15 mg once daily. The 
recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily. For the treatment of acute manic episodes in bipolar 
disorder, the recommended initial oral dose is 15 mg once daily as monotherapy, or combination therapy. For 
preventing recurrence of manic episodes, it is recommended to continue therapy at the same dose administered 
for treatment of acute episodes. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. 
The Applicant of Aripiprazole Accord sought approval for 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (pack sizes of 
14x1, 28x1, 56x1 and 98x1 tablets for all strengths and 30 and 100 tablets in a bottle for all but the 30 mg 
strength)  in  the  full  range  of  indications  approved  for  the  reference  product  Abilify.  The  Application  was 
supported by two bioequivalence (BE) studies. The studies were carried out with the tablet strengths of 5 and 
10 mg, respectively, instead of the highest strengths of 15 and 30 mg. The Applicant justified the use of a lower 
strength with safety reasons including publically available literature and requested a biowaiver for the remaining 
strengths. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as tablets containing 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg of aripiprazole as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, maize starch, hydroxypropylcellulose, 
magnesium stearate, indigo carmine aluminium lake (E132) for 5 mg tablets, iron oxide red (E172) for 10 mg 
and 30 mg tablets and iron oxide yellow (E172) for 15 mg tablets.  
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blisters. Aripiprazole accord 5 mg, 10 mg 
and 15 mg tablets are also available in HDPE bottles with PPCRC closure. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of aripiprazole is 
7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and has the following 
structure: 
The structure has been confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry, FT-IR and UV spectroscopy. 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 8/26 
 
  
  
  
 
The active substance is a white or almost white crystals or crystalline hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble 
in water, soluble in methylene chloride and very slightly soluble in ethanol (96 per cent). Its molecular weight is 
448.4 g∙mol-1, corresponding to the general molecular formula C23H27Cl2N3O2. 
Aripiprazole does not exhibit stereoisomerism, as it has no chiral centre. Polymorphism has been observed for 
this active substance. Aripiprazole is known in several polymorphic forms, i.e. hydrate-A, anhydride forms 
(classified as crystal B, C, D, E, F and G; or type I and type II crystals) and an amorphous form. It has been 
confirmed by P-XRD patterns that the active substance manufacturer consistently produces the same 
polymorphic form (anhydrous form B, Type-I crystals) and the stability data submitted demonstrate that 
humidity has no impact in the polymorphic form of aripiprazole and there is no interchangeability of the 
polymorphic form following storage.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in four main synthetic steps by a convergent route using well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications, followed by purification, drying, micronisation, and sifting. 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested to redefine one of the proposed starting materials to ensure that 
steps critical to the quality of the active substance are described in the dossier.  
The description of the manufacturing process has been adequately described. Adequate in-process controls are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. Although raw materials with potential genotoxic activity are used 
in the synthesis of aripiprazole, it has been demonstrated that their levels do not exceed 30% of the TTC limit 
in the final active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
The active substance is packed in transparent polyethylene bags, tied with a plastic tag. This is placed in a black 
bag and tied with a plastic tag. This bag is placed in HDPE drum.  
The polythene bags comply with EU directives 2002/72/EC as amended by 2004/1/EC, 2004/19/EC, 
2005/79/EC, 2008/39/EC, 975/2009/EC,  EU regulation 1282/2011 amended from 10/2011, the European 
guideline on plastic intermediate packaging materials (CHMP/QWP/4359/03) and Ph. Eur. requirements.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification 
(IR, HPLC), appearance of solution (clarity and colour of the solution) (Ph. Eur.), polymorphism (XRD), 
hygroscopicity (KF), limit of chloride (turbidimetry), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC, GC-MS, LC-MS), assay (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), particle 
size (laser diffraction) and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.). 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 9/26 
 
  
  
  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on six commercial scale batches of the active substance have been provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on commercial-scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH (nine batches) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH (three batches) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: description, identification, polymorphism, loss 
on drying, water content, related substances and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. All results were within the proposed specifications and no negative trends 
were observed. 
Forced degradation studies under exposure to heat (up to 105°C), humidity, light (according to ICH Q1B) in solid 
state, and water, acid or base hydrolysis, and oxidation in solution were also performed on one batch. Samples 
were tested for related substances and assay. Degradation was observed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide 
only. It is thus demonstrated that aripiprazole is photostable. The analytical methods have shown to be 
stability-indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable and justify the proposed retest period of 5 years in the proposed container with no special precautions for 
storage. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable generic formulation of aripiprazole 
bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Abilify 5 mg, 10 mg 15 mg and 30 mg tablets.  
Therefore, the four strengths of the reference product were characterised in order to establish the physical 
(appearance, average weight, thickness and disintegration time) and chemical (assay, related substances, 
impurities) characteristics of the reference product. The formulation approach for the different strengths was to 
develop a dose-weight proportional formulation for the 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths, while maintaining 
the 5 mg tablets identical in weight to the 10 mg tablets. 
During the formulation development, the finished product manufacturer studied key physicochemical 
characteristics of the active substance which could influence the performance of the finished product, including 
appearance, solubility, melting point, bulk density, compressibility, isomerism, polymorphism, hygroscopicity, 
particle size and pH solubility profile. From bulk density and compressibility studies it was concluded that 
aripiprazole (Type I) exhibits very poor flow properties. With regards to polymorphism, XRD analysis confirmed 
that the aripiprazole polymorph manufactured by the ASMF holder is aripiprazole anhydrous Type-I crystals. 
Additionally, the particle size distribution study concluded that since the drug substance is practically insoluble 
in water, its particle size should be controlled in order to achieve the desired dissolution profile. The results from 
the pH solubility study were used for the selection of the dissolution media.  
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 10/26 
 
  
  
  
The excipients used for the manufacture of Aripiprazole Accord tablets are the same used in the reference 
product, namely: lactose monohydrate (diluent), microcrystalline cellulose (diluent/disintegrant), maize starch 
(disintegrant), hydroxypropylcellulose (binder), magnesium stearate (lubricant) and ferric oxide red, ferric 
oxide yellow and carmine aluminium lake (colorants). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards except for the colourants, which are described in the 
USP/USNF. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Due to the low dose of the active 
substance, its static nature and its low particle size, which might lead to segregation and poor drug distribution, 
a wet granulation process was selected for the manufacture of the tablets. 
A trial 10 mg tablet batch was initially manufactured, characterized and compared with the reference product. 
Based on the results from this study, the formulation development continued with the alteration of the levels of 
different excipients (e.g. cellulose microcrystalline, maize starch, magnesium stearate) and the manufacturing 
process itself until the physical characteristics of the tablets obtained were found to be satisfactory and the 
dissolution profile comparable to that of the reference medicinal product. Then, tablets of the other proposed 
strengths 5 mg, 15 mg and 30mg were manufactured and further formulation optimization was conducted. 
Two bioequivalence studies were performed showing bioequivalence between aripiprazole 5 mg and 10 mg test 
products and the reference products Abilify 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, respectively. A request for a biowaiver for 
15 mg and 30 mg strengths was submitted on the basis that: i) the 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths are 
manufactured by the same manufacturer using the same manufacturing process, ii) the qualitative composition 
of the aripiprazole 15 mg and 30 mg is the same as that of aripiprazole 10 mg, iii) the composition of the 15 mg 
and 30 mg strengths are quantitatively proportional to the 10 mg strength, iv) aripiprazole exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics, and v) the in-vitro dissolution profile is similar under identical conditions for 15 mg and 30 mg 
strengths and the strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study (10 mg).  
The dissolution profile of the different strengths of test and reference product strengths was subsequently 
studied in pH 1.2 HCl buffer, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. Although similarity of the 
dissolution profiles of the test and reference product for the 5mg and 10 mg strengths was not demonstrated in 
pH 4.5 acetate buffer, the similarity of the dissolution profiles for these tablets strengths was demonstrated at 
pH 1.2 and pH 6.8 buffers, and in-vivo bioequivalence was also demonstrated for these two strengths.  
Similarity of dissolution profiles of the 10mg test product (biobatch) and the proposed additional strengths 
(15mg and 30mg) was demonstrated in pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 buffers. Therefore, the biowaiver was 
considered acceptable. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was demonstrated.  
The primary packaging for the four strengths is Aluminium-Aluminium (Alu-Alu) perforated unit dose blisters. 
These blisters replaced the original blisters proposed by the applicant, which were not considered acceptable by 
the CHMP as they were not peelable, did not include perforations, and were too hard to break through, and 
therefore could result in tablets break when forced out of the blister. In order to support this change of blister 
pack,  the  applicant  submitted  comparative  studies  between  the  two  blister  packs  and  stability  data,  which 
confirmed that both packagings have similar properties. Additionally, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tablets are also 
available in HDPE bottle with PPCRC closure.  The  material complies with Ph.Eur. and  EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product.  
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 11/26 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the tablets is a standard wet granulation process which consists of nine main 
steps: co-sifting, dry mixing, granulation/wet milling, drying, sifting/sizing, blending, lubrication, compression 
of tablets and packaging.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
average weight of tablets, identification (HPLC, IR, UV), resistance to crushing of tablets (Ph. Eur.), friability (Ph. 
Eur.), water content (KF), dissolution (HPLC-UV), uniformity to dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances 
(HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). The finished product is released on the 
market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on two commercial scale batches of the 5 mg strength and 3 commercial 
scale batches of 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process 
and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of two commercial scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for up to 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of aripiprazole tablets were identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in a primary similar (Alu-Alu blister) or identical (HDPE bottles) 
to that proposed for marketing.  
As mentioned above, additional stability data on one batch of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tablets packed in the 
Alu-Alu blisters to be marketed, stored for 6 months at accelerated and long term conditions were also provided 
in order to support the change of blister pack during the evaluation.  
Samples were tested for description, resistance to crushing, water content, dissolution, related substances, 
assay and microbial examination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All results were within 
specifications and no negative trends were observed.  
In addition, one 10 mg strength batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The tablets were exposed to light unpacked, in the immediate 
pack and in the marketing pack. Samples were tested for description, assay and related substances. The results 
from this study demonstrated that the product is photostable in Alu-Alu packs and HDPE bottles. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out to identify the likely degradation products. The following conditions 
were selected: acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, heat degradation (up to 60 °C), oxidation, UV and water 
hydrolysis. It was demonstrated that aripiprazole does not degrade significantly when exposed to stress 
conditions except for oxidation. 
A thermal cycling study was performed to study the effect of transportation on stability of Aripiprazole tablets 
showing that all tested parameters remained within the specifications. 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 12/26 
 
  
  
  
An in-use stability study was conducted on Aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg tablets packed in HDPE bottles. 
Results showed that all tested parameters remained within specifications 30 days (30 tablets HDPE bottle) and 
100 days (100 tablets HDPE bottle) after breaking the seal of the container. 
A polymorphism stability study was also conducted on the drug substance, placebo of the finished product and 
the 4 strengths of the finished product at 40 0C / 75% RH. It demonstrated that the polymorphic form remains 
stable and unchanged during manufacturing process of Aripiprazole tablets and upon storage. 
Based on available stability data, a shelf-life of 2 years with no special storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC, 
is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose is the only excipient from animal or human origin used for the manufacture of the product. It is 
confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to 
collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material 
other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. As requested by the CHMP, the applicant redefined one of the proposed 
starting materials to ensure that all critical steps of the synthetic process are now described in the dossier. The 
concern regarding initially proposed blister pack, which was not peelable and was too hard to push the tablet 
through it, was also satisfactorily addressed. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based  on  up-to-date  and  adequate  scientific  literature.  The  overview  justified  that  there  was  no  need  to 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 13/26 
 
  
  
  
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects 
of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The 
impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies were required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as the introduction 
of  Aripiprazole  Accord  was  considered  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales 
volumes for all aripiprazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. 
Thus, the risks to the environment were expected to remain the same. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusions on non-clinical aspects 
For a generic of a reference medicinal product no toxicological and pharmacological tests are required.  
The CHMP concluded that no additional non-clinical data were needed. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
Introduction 
The Application concerned four strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) of Aripiprazole Accord tablets. To 
support the Application, the results of two single dose, cross-over BE studies under fasting conditions were 
provided using 5 and 10 mg tablets, respectively. The higher strengths of 15 and 30 mg were not used for safety 
reasons (see section on the biowaiver below) 
The Applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of aripiprazole based on the reference product and published literature. The SmPC was in line 
with the SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The Applicant claimed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
The  Applicant  provided  a statement to  the  effect  that  clinical trials  conducted  outside the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption (Biowaiver) 
The Applicant justified the choice of the 5 and 10 mg tablet strengths for the BE studies since aripiprazole has 
been  poorly  tolerated  by  healthy  volunteers,  particularly  at  the  higher  dose  levels.  In  a  BE  study,  after 
administration  of  30  mg  oral  aripiprazole,  adverse  effects  leading  to  postural  dizziness  and  blood  pressure 
lowering were observed in some of the healthy volunteers (Mandal U et al. 2008). In another study in healthy 
volunteers, it was found that aripiprazole can affect cognitive function and alter frontal metabolic function linked 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 14/26 
 
  
  
  
to greater D2 receptor occupancy, which in turn increases with the dose. Other studies with 30 mg aripiprazole 
revealed that adverse effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, accidental injury 
and akathisia occurred very commonly and  led to dose  reductions in several patients (Keck PE et al. 2003, 
Swainston HT et al. 2004). 
For these reasons, the Applicant requested a biowaiver for the 15 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths.  
For the reference product Abilify, linear pharmacokinetics (PK) of aripiprazole in the therapeutic dose range of 
5-30  mg  has  been  established.  Other  biowaiver  criteria  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), regarding the same manufacturer and manufacturing process and 
the  qualitative  composition/quantitative  proportionality  of  the  composition  of  all  tablet  strengths,  have  also 
been fulfilled.  
To  support  the  claim  of  a  biowaiver,  the  Applicant  furthermore  conducted  comparative  in-vitro  dissolution 
studies with the 10 mg (reference), 15 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths at 3 dissolution media (i.e. at pH 1.2, 4.5 
and 6.8) using a paddle apparatus with a rotation speed of 50 rpm. Twelve units of each batch [10 mg tablets 
(reference), 15mg and 30mg] were included in the dissolution studies in all three media. The results of these 
studies showed similar dissolution profiles of the 15 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths compared to 10 mg tablets 
at all conditions tested. 
Conclusions 
The CHMP  considered that the requirements for  a biowaiver for the 15 mg and 30 mg strengths were met. 
Comparative  in-vitro  dissolution  studies  were  performed  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev  1).  Based  on  the  result  of  these  studies,  similarity  of  the 
dissolution profiles of the 15 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths with the 10 mg tablets could be concluded.  
In line with the Guideline on the Investigation  of  Bioequivalence, lower  strengths may  be  selected  if higher 
strengths cannot be administered to healthy volunteers for safety/tolerability reasons. The CHMP considered 
that the risk of adverse reactions with aripiprazole increases with dose. In addition to the justification provided 
by  the  Applicant,  the  CHMP  took  into  account  the  risk  of  acute  laryngeal  dystonia,  a  class  effect  of  first 
generation  antipsychotic  drugs,  whereby  symptoms  are  known  to  occur  more  frequently  and  with  greater 
severity with higher doses/potencies. Therefore, the choice of the 5 mg and 10 mg tablets for the BE studies 
over the higher tablet strengths of 15 and 30 mg was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Two BE studies were provided in support of this Application: 
Study  463-12: An open label, balanced, randomized, two treatment, two period, two sequence, crossover, 
single  oral  dose,  bioequivalence  study  of  two  formulations  of  Aripiprazole  tablets  5  mg  in  healthy,  elderly, 
human subjects under fasting conditions. 
Study  509-12:  An open label, balanced,  randomized  two  treatment,  two  period, two  sequence, crossover, 
single oral dose, bioequivalence study of two formulations of Aripiprazole tablets  10  mg in healthy, elderly, 
human subjects under fasting conditions 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 15/26 
 
  
  
  
Methods 
Study design  
Both studies were open label, randomised, two treatment, two period, two sequence, crossover, single oral 
dose, comparative oral bioavailability studies to establish comparative BE of Aripiprazole 5 mg tablets or 10 mg 
tablets (test product) and Abilify 5 mg or 10 mg tablets (reference product), respectively, in healthy, elderly, 
male human subjects under fasting conditions. The objective of the studies was to compare the rate and extent 
of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events (AE) to ensure the safety and tolerability of a 
single dose of Aripiprazole 5 mg/10 mg. 
In each study period, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, each volunteer received a single 5 mg 
(study 463-12) or 10 mg (study 509-12) oral dose of test or reference product with 240 ml of water. Subjects 
were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the first 
8 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and until one 
hour  post  dose.  Subjects  were  confined  to  the  clinical  facility  from  at  least  12  hours  prior  to  each  drug 
administration until after the 72-hour blood sample collection in each study period. 
In line with the randomisation scheme, subjects received either test of reference product in study period I and 
then crossed-over to receive the other product in period II. The washout period was at least 45 days which is 
more than 5 times the half-life of aripiprazole (elimination half-life of 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of 
Cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 and 146 hours in slow metabolisers of CYP2D6). 
In study 463-12, blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0 minutes, 0.5 
minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.333, 3.667,4, (lunch) 4.333, 4.667, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 
and 72 hours after dosing.  
In study 509-12, blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.5 minutes, 1,1.5, 2, 
2.33, 2.667, 3, 3.33, 3.667, 4, 4.333, 4.667, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 10, 12,16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after 
dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are presented in the dossier.

Population studied   
Main inclusion criteria (both studies): 
Healthy,  elderly,  non-smokers,  non-alcoholics,  human  volunteers  between  45  to  60  years  of  age  (both 
inclusive), having a Body Mass Index between 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) and having given their written 
informed consent were enrolled for the studies. They did not have any significant diseases or clinically significant 
abnormal findings during screening, medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, treadmill test, 
12-lead electrocardiogram and Chest X-ray (postero-anterior view) recordings.  
Study 463-12 (5 mg tablets) enrolled 43 healthy elderly male human subjects as per the protocol (including 2 
extra  subjects).  The  study  started  with  40 subjects  (one  patient  discontinued  on  his  own  accords)  and  29 
completed the study. Amongst the 11 drop outs, 5 subjects withdrew during period I (3 on medical grounds, AE, 
and 2 due to emesis). The remaining subjects withdrew in or after period II based on medical grounds (1, AE), 
protocol deviation (2, alcohol consumption), and on their own accord (3). 
Study 509-12 (10 mg tablets) enrolled 46 healthy elderly male human subjects as per the protocol (including 2 
extra subjects). The study started with 44 subjects and 40 completed the study. Prior to dosing period I, two 
subjects did not want to participate in the study and were replaced by another two subjects who were already 
checked in as spares. Four subjects dropped out of the study in total. One drop out was during period I after an 
AE (emesis) and three subjects dropped out during period II. Two subjects left the study on their own accord and 
one subject dropped out due to an AE (emesis).  
Analytical methods   
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method for aripiprazole. Calibration 
curves based on an 8-point calibration curve standard for aripiprazole (aripiprazole-d8) were used to determine 
the concentrations of aripiprazole in the human plasma samples obtained from the study subjects. All samples 
were  immediately  prepared  for  analysis  and  frozen  at  a  temperature  of  -65  ±  10°C  for  interim  storage  till 
transfer to the bio-analytical facility. The longest storage period was 72 days and this covered by the stability 
data in the validation of the test method.  
Method  validation  for  study  463-12  (5  mg  tablets)  resulted  in  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  of  this 
method for the estimation of aripiprazole concentrations in plasma was 0.498ng/ml (precision 0.9%; accuracy 
100.7%). The linearity range of aripiprazole was from 0.498ng/ml to 50.147ng/ml (8 point curve). 
Method validation for  study 509-12 (10 mg tablets) resulted in a LLOQ of this method for the estimation of 
aripiprazole concentrations in plasma was 0.508 ng/ml (precision 1.4%; accuracy 97.3%). The linearity range 
of aripiprazole was from 0.508 ng/ml to 150.296 ng/ml (8 point curve). 
All concentration values below the LLOQ were set to zero for the pharmacokinetic and statistical calculations. 
PK variables  
The primary PK parameters calculated for aripiprazole were: 
 
 
cmax: Maximum measured plasma concentration (ng/mL). 
tmax: Time of observing the peak concentration (h). 
  AUC0-72h: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve in ng*h /mL calculated by linear trapezoidal 
method. 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 17/26 
 
  
  
  
Statistical methods   
Descriptive statistics were computed and reported for all PK parameters of aripiprazole. ANOVA, power and ratio 
analysis for ln-transformed PK parameters cmax and AUC0-72h were computed. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) 
for  the  ratio  of  the  geometric  least-squares  means  were  calculated  for  the  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic 
parameters cmax and AUC0-72h.  
Statistical comparison of the ln-transformed cmax and AUC0-72h was based on the ANOVA model, and was carried 
out using SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) by PROC MIXED. The treatment, period and sequence 
effects were included in the model as fixed effects, and subject within sequence as a random effect. All main 
effects were tested at the 0.05 level of significance using mean square error as the error term. 
BE of the test versus the reference product was concluded if the 90% CI of the relative mean cmax and AUC0-72h 
fell within the acceptance range of at least 80.00% and not more than 125.00% for ln-transformed data.

Safety data 
In study 463-12, 37 subjects received test product and 33 received the reference product Abilify. A total of 7 AEs 
were reported by 7 subjects. Six AEs were reported in study period I and 1 AE was reported during post-study 
safety assessment. Five AEs were reported in subjects after administration of the test product and two AEs were 
reported in subjects after administration of the reference product. All AEs were mild in nature and the subjects 
were followed up until resolution. The causality assessment was judged ‘possible’ for 5 AEs and as unrelated for 
2 AEs.  
There were no deaths and serious AEs reported during the conduct of the study. However, four significant AEs 
were reported during the conduct of the study: ligament sprain (1), pyrexia each to subject (2) and toothache 
(1). All four subjects were withdrawn from the study on medical grounds. The causality assessment was judged 
as unrelated for two AEs (ligament sprain and toothache) and possible for other two AEs of pyrexia. The latter 
AEs occurred after administration of the test (1 subject) and the reference product (1 subject). 
In study 509-12, 42 subjects received test product and 43 received the reference product (Abilify).  Two AEs 
were reported by two subjects during the conduct of the study. One AE was reported in period I and the other 
in period II. Both AEs were cases of emesis that were reported in subjects after administration of the reference 
product. Both the AEs were mild in nature and the subjects were followed up until resolution. The volunteers that 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 19/26 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
encountered the AEs completely recovered before the end of the study. The causality assessment for both the 
AEs  concluded  that  a  relationship  to  the  use  of  aripiprazole  was  possible.  There  were  no  deaths  and 
serious/significant AEs during the conduct of the study.  
In summary, both test and reference products were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no relevant 
differences were observed in safety profiles of the products.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented BE studies, Aripiprazole Accord 5 mg tablets are considered bioequivalent with Abilify 
5 mg tablets and Aripiprazole Accord 10 mg tablets are considered bioequivalent with Abilify 10 mg tablets.  
Furthermore, the results of study  463-12 using the 10 mg tablet strength can be extrapolated to the other 
strengths applied for (15 and 30 mg), as relevant conditions as laid down in the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence were met. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this Application. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The design of both studies 463-12 and 509-12 were considered by the CHMP to be suitable to investigate BE 
between  immediate  release  formulations.  The  study  population  and  sample  size,  washout  period,  sampling 
times  and  analyte  (patent  compound)  were  considered  adequate.  Furthermore,  since  intake  of  aripiprazole 
tablets is recommended on an empty stomach, it was considered appropriate and in line with the Guideline on 
the Investigation of Bioequivalence that the study was conducted under fasting conditions.  
Biobatch and commercial batch size were identical. The analytical methods were adequately validated and the 
PK parameters investigated were appropriate, including truncation of the AUC at 72 hours which is acceptable 
for immediate release formulations. 
Based on the results of the studies, the CHMP considered that BE between the test and reference products has 
been adequately demonstrated for the 5 mg and 10 mg tablet strengths with respect to the rate and extent of 
absorption,  as  the  90%  CIs  of  the  ratios  for  AUC0-72h  and  cmax  were      within  the  acceptance  range  of 
80.00-125.00% and  tmax was comparable. Furthermore, all requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence for a biowaiver were fulfilled. Adequate comparative in-vitro dissolution studies were carried 
out and the choice of lower strengths over the 15 and 30 mg tablets for the BE studies was agreed by the CHMP 
based on the justification presented by the Applicant. Consequently, the CHMP agreed that the results of the BE 
study with 10 mg tablets could be extrapolated to the 15 mg and 30 mg strengths. 
Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the available data, the CHMP concluded that bioequivalence of Aripiprazole Accord 5 mg tablets to 
Abilify 5 mg tablets and Aripiprazole Accord 10 mg tablets to Abilify 10 mg tablets has been demonstrated. As 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015 
Page 20/26 
 
  
  
  
all criteria for a biowaiver were met, the CHMP agreed that the results of the BE study with the 10 mg tablet 
strength could be extrapolated to the 15 mg and 30 mg tablets. Taken together, the available clinical data were 
considered adequate to support the Application for Aripiprazole Accord 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets 
as a generic medicinal product to Abilify tablets. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the requirements 
and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person  responsible  for 
pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse  reaction  suspected  of 
occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4 with the following content:

2.7.  PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
EMA/CHMP/523618/2015

subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Abilify 5/10/15/30 mg tablets and Solifenacin succinate 5/10mg 
film-coated tablets, the latter for design and layout. The bridging report submitted by the Applicant has been 
found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This Application concerns a generic version of Aripiprazole tablets. The reference product Abilify is indicated for 
the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and older, treatment of moderate to 
severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who 
experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment as 
well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 
13 years and older. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics nor 
the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based 
on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Two bioequivalence studies were submitted in support of the Application. The studies’ design was in line with the 
respective European requirements and adequate to evaluate bioequivalence of this formulation compared to the 
reference product. The test formulation of Aripiprazole Accord 5 mg tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Abilify 5 mg tablets. The test formulation of Aripiprazole Accord 10 mg 
tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Abilify 10 mg tablets. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was thus demonstrated. Furthermore, it was considered acceptable to 
extrapolate bioequivalence demonstrated for the 10 mg tablet strength to the 15 mg and 30 mg strengths as 
the requirements for a biowaiver as provided for in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence were 
met. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Aripiprazole Accord in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 
15 years and older, treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention 
of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes 
responded to aripiprazole treatment as well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes 
in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older is favourable and therefore recommends the

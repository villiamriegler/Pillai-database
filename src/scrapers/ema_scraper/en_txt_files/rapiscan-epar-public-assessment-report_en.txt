2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacologic  Stress  Agents  in  Radionuclide  Myocardial  Perfusion  Imaging  Single  photon  emission 
computed  tomography  (SPECT)  myocardial  perfusion  imaging  (MPI;  also  known  as  myocardial 
perfusion scintigraphy (MPS)) studies with radionuclide agents are used in the detection and functional 
characterization  of  ischemic  heart  disease,  providing  information  that  is  incremental  to  and 
independent  from  that  of  other  assessments  including  clinical  characteristics,  exercise  tolerance, 
electrocardiography,  and  coronary  angiography.  The  technique  is  based  on  the  principle  that 
radiopharmaceuticals  distribute  proportionally  to  myocardial  blood  flow.  In  an  MPI  study,  two  images 
are  obtained:  one  image  is  obtained  at  rest  and  a  second  under  conditions  that  increase  coronary 
blood flow (CBF), such as exercise or the application of a pharmacologic stress agent (e.g., a coronary 
vasodilator)  which  simulates  the  increase  in  CBF  caused  by  exercise.  During  exercise  or  with 
administration  of  a  pharmacologic  agent,  there  is  an  increase  in  coronary  transmural  blood  flow  and 
collateral  redistribution  of  blood  flow.  However,  in  patients  with  significant  coronary  artery  disease 
(CAD)  a  redistribution  of  CBF  occurs  with  an  increase  in  blood  flow  to  normal  coronaries  due  to 
vasodilatation, and a relative decrease of blood flow in stenotic arteries. This ‘coronary steal’ translates 
into less perfused regional myocardium area which can be imaged (detected) with radionuclide tracers.  
Referral  of  patients  for  MPS  has  increased  in  all  European  countries  over  the  last  20  years,  but  with 
variations  both  between  and  within  countries.    Three  radiopharmaceuticals  are  approved:  thallium 
(201Tl)  chloride,  technetium  (99mTc)  tetrofosmin  and  technetium (99mTc)  sestamibi.   A  major  limitation 
of thallium (201Tl) is the high false-positive rate attributed to image attenuation artifacts.  Technetium-
based  tracers  have  improved  imaging  characteristics  of  thallium  (201Tl)  scan.  Moreover,  ECG  gated 
acquisition (gated SPECT imaging), which is easier with technetium-based agents, allows simultaneous 
evaluation of left ventricular perfusion and systolic function, identification of attenuation artifacts, and 
myocardial stunning.   
Adenosine is a vasodilator of the coronary and peripheral circulation. The effect of adenosine to cause 
coronary  and  possibly  peripheral  vasodilatation  is  mediated  primarily  by  the  A2A  adenosine  receptor 
(A2A-AdoR)  present  in  the  vascular  wall.  The  sensitivity  of  the  coronary  circulation  to  adenosine  and 
adenosine  analogues  appears  to  be  greater  than  that  of  the  peripheral  vasculature.  This  differential 
sensitivity is likely, in part, due to a larger A2A spare receptor capacity of coronary vessels relative to 
peripheral  resistance  vessels.  Other  adenosine  receptor  subtypes  (e.g.,  A2B)  may  play  a  significant 
role  as  mediators  of  the  peripheral  vasodilatation  caused  by  adenosine  and  non-selective  agonists.  
Consequently,  heterogeneous  receptor  expression  levels  and  their  relative  contributions  to  the 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 4/43
 
 
 
  
 
 
vasodilatation caused by adenosine may account for the differential sensitivity among vascular beds to 
the action of adenosine and other unselective agonists. The coronary vasodilator effect of adenosine is 
the  basis  for  its  use,  in  conjunction  with  radionuclide  MPI,  to  detect  underperfused  areas  of 
myocardium.  Dipyridamole,  a  nucleoside  transport  inhibitor,  acts  by  limiting  cellular  re-uptake  of 
adenosine  thereby  increasing  plasma  and  tissue  levels  of  adenosine.  Adenosine  directly,  and 
dipyridamole  indirectly,  activate  all  four  known  AdoR  subtypes,  designated  A1,  A2A,  A2B,  and  A3, 
which  mediate  a  variety  of  responses  in  different  tissues.  Adenosine  and  dipyridamole  are  capable  of 
causing significantly greater increases of CBF to myocardial areas perfused  by normal, as opposed to 
stenotic,  coronary  arteries.  Both  agents  cause  a  differential  distribution  of  radionuclide  between 
myocardium  perfused  by  normal  and  stenotic  coronary  arteries,  thereby  permitting  visualization  of 
myocardial  perfusion  defects.  The  safety,  reliability,  and  diagnostic  accuracy  of  pharmacologic  stress 
induced  by  adenosine  and  dipyridamole  have  led  to  their  widespread  use  for  detection  of  myocardial 
perfusion  defects  with  radiopharmaceuticals  in  patients  with  known  or  suspected  CAD,  with  paced 
ventricular rhythm or left bundle branch block and in other clinical scenarios.  
The current vasodilator stress agents for use in MPI, adenosine and dipyridamole, are administered as 
IV infusions and are associated with an overall high incidence of side effects. The ability to administer 
such  an  agent  as  a  rapid  injection  would  provide  the  added  benefit  of  increasing  the  convenience  of 
MPI procedures. 
Regadenoson  was  developed  as  a  short-acting  pharmacologic  stress  agent  (administered  as  a  single 
400 μg iv bolus) in conjunction with radionuclide MPI/MPS because it has low yet selective affinity for 
the  A2A-AdoR,  has  high  potency  for  increasing  CBF,  and  preferentially  causes  greater  coronary  than 
peripheral vasodilatation in animal models. Thus, regadenoson has the potential to selectively increase 
CBF, while minimizing some of the side effects caused by the currently approved pharmacologic stress 
agents,  via  the  selective  activation  of  the  receptor  responsible  for  the  coronary  vasodilatory  effect  of 
adenosine (i.e., the A2A-AdoR) and not the other AdoR subtypes (e.g., the A1-AdoR in the heart and 
the A2B-AdoR on mast cells). In addition, administration of regadenoson via IV bolus in a unit dose is 
more  convenient  for  the  patient  and  nuclear  practitioner  than  is  administration  of  the  existing  stress 
agents using weight-based infusion. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The medicinal product Rapiscan 0.4 mg/5ml solution for injection is presented as a single use glass vial 
containing 5 ml of a solution for injection which contains 0.4 mg of the active substance regadenoson. 
Other ingredients are specified in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Rapiscan is packed in a 5 ml Type I glass 
vial, closed with a 13 mm rubber stopper and an aluminium flip-off cap with polypropylene disk. Each 
vial is packaged in an individual carton box.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The chemical name of the active substance regadenoson is: adenosine, 2-[4-[(methylamino)carbonyl]-
1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-,  monohydrate.  The  International  Non  Property  Name  (INN)  is  regadenoson.  The 
molecular formula is C15H18N8O5.H2O and the molecular weight is 408.37 g/mol. The structural formula 
is shown below: 
.H2O 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 5/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Regadenoson  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder.  It  is  practically  insoluble  in  water,  soluble  in 
dimethylacetamide,  slightly  soluble  in  methanol  and  ethanol,  and  very  slightly  soluble  in  mixtures  of 
propylene  glycol  and  water.  Regadenoson  is  practically  insoluble  (<0.1  mg/ml)  in  buffered  aqueous 
solutions  at  pH  levels  between  2  and  7.5.  A  melting  range  could  not  be  determined  because 
regadenoson decomposes before melting. Studies on the crystal morphology of regadenoson concluded 
that regadenoson exists in different polymorphic forms. During the manufacturing process, the crystal 
monohydrate  form  of  regadenoson  is  isolated.  Thermogravimetric  analysis  and  water  content  by  Karl 
Fischer  titration  have  indicated  that  the  monohydrate  is  a  stable  form  of  regadenoson  and  is  not 
hygroscopic. There is no Ph Eur  monograph for regadenoson.  
The  chemical  structure  of  regadenoson  has  been  confirmed  by  elemental  analysis,  ultraviolet  (UV), 
Infrared  (IR),  1H-nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR),  13C  NMR,  and  mass  spectra.  All  data  are 
consistent with the proposed structure. 
2.2.2.1. 
 Manufacture 
The manufacture of regadenoson consists of a four-step process, starting from commercially available 
raw  materials.  The  last  step  is  the  recrystallization  of  regadenoson.  Detailed  information  on  the 
manufacturing  process,  control  of  starting  materials,  reagents  and  solvents,  control  of  critical  steps 
and intermediates, process development and process validation of the active substance manufacturing 
have been provided by the applicant. The applicant did not use the active substance master file (ASMF) 
procedure. All manufacturing steps are adequately described. Adequate in-process controls are in place 
and appropriate specifications have been adopted for the starting materials, solvents and reagents. All 
relevant impurities, degradation products and residual solvents have been appropriately characterized. 
Validation  batches  results  confirm  the  reproducibility  of  the  manufacturing  process  to  produce  the 
active  substance  with  the  quality  established.  Regadenoson  is  supplied  by  one  active  substance 
manufacturer. 
2.2.2.2. 
 Specification 
As no Ph Eur monograph exists for regadenoson, in-house specifications have been set for the active 
substance,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  relevant  ICH  guidelines.  The  active  substance 
specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR  spectra),  assay  of 
regadenoson  and  related  substances  (HPLC),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph  Eur),  residual  solvents  (GC), 
water  content  (Karl  Fischer),  specific  rotation,  heavy  metals,  bacterial  endotoxins  and  microbial  limit 
(all  as  in  Ph  Eur).  Since  the  finished  product,  Rapiscan,  is  a  solution  for  injection,  the  regadenoson 
specification does not include the particle size acceptance criterion, which is in line with the ICH Q6A 
guideline. The analytical test procedures have been satisfactorily described and validated. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety. Batch analysis data have 
been  presented  and  confirm  compliance  with  the  predefined  active  substance  specifications.  In 
accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.2.3. 
 Stability 
Stability  studies  have  been  performed  at  long  term  (25C,  60%  RH)  and  accelerated  (40ºC,  75%RH) 
conditions  on  three  registration  and  three  production  scale  batches  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Q1A 
guideline. Up to 30 months of long term stability data, and up to 6 months of accelerated stability data 
has been provided, confirming the stability of regadenoson. The batches tested were manufactured at 
the commercial manufacturing site and packaged in the packaging proposed for marketing. Supporting 
stability data was provided for phase 3 clinical studies batches. However, the latter batches were not 
manufactured at the site authorised within the Rapiscan marketing authorisation. The test parameters 
evaluated  in  these  studies  were  appearance,  water  content,  assay  and  organic  impurities  by  HPLC, 
bacterial  endotoxins  and  microbial  limit.  The  test methods  used  are  the  same  as  the  routine  controls 
and are shown to be stability indicating.  
Forced  degradation  studies,  under  basic,  acidic,  oxidative,  heat  and  humidity  conditions,  including  a 
photostability  study  have  been  performed  on  regadenoson  to  identify  potential  degradation  products 
that  could  be  formed  in  active  substance.  Stress  studies  demonstrate  the  stability  of  the  drug 
substance  in  the  solid  state.  Since  the  regadenoson  is  terminally  sterilized,  a  separate  study  was 
performed  to  generate  degradation  products  by  autoclaving  a  methanol/water  (50:50)  solution  of 
1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union 
EMA/455580/2010

regadenoson at 121ºC for 2 hours. Regadenoson has been shown to generate low levels of degradation 
products in solution at neutral pH under autoclave conditions with temperatures of ~121ºC. 
The photostability testing has been performed according to ICH Q1B under lighting option 2. Stability 
of  the  active  substance  was  evaluated  after  light  exposure  to  cool  white  fluorescent  light  (up  to  2.4 
million lux-h) and UV-A light (up to 400 watt-h/m2) at 25ºC/60% RH. The attributes monitored were 
description, assay and organic impurities/degradation products. The results showed that regadenoson 
in solid state did not degrade under the conditions tested. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  provided,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  proposed  retest  period  is  justified 
when  the  active  substance  is  stored  in  the  proposed  packaging  material  under  the  proposed  storage 
conditions. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  sterile  solution  for  injection  containing 
0.4 mg/5 ml regadenoson which can be administered intravenously as a rapid bolus. 
Due  to  the  low  aqueous  solubility  of  regadenoson,  several  co-solvents  and  surfactants  have  been 
investigated in the development of the Rapiscan solution for injection. Propylene glycol was identified 
as  an  appropriate  co-solvent  to  formulate  Rapiscan.  An  in  vitro  biomaterial  study  demonstrated  that 
the concentration of propylene glycol used in the final formulation is non-hemolytic with human whole 
blood.  The  use  of  this  excipient  in  parenteral  formulations  is  well  known.  Because  regadenoson 
degrades  under  extreme  pH  conditions,  Rapiscan  is  developed  as  a  solution  for  injection  with  neutral 
pH. Considering that the active substance is present as a solution, the possible polymorphic changes of 
the solid regadenoson are not of concern. 
The selection of the excipients is based on the results of formulation screening studies. The excipients 
were selected for their abilities to maintain a neutral pH under stress conditions, to act as a co-solvent 
to prevent precipitation of regadenoson over time and to act as a chelating agent for any trace metal 
ions  to  prevent  catalytic  hydrolysis  of  regadenoson  and  to  prevent  precipitation  from  a  possible 
interaction of glass vial surface with phosphorus from the phosphate buffer (EDTA).  
In  addition,  the  compatibility  of  the  selected  excipients  with  regadenoson  was  investigated.  The 
excipients  used  in  Rapiscan  solution  for  injection  are  compendial-grade  pharmaceutical  ingredients 
commonly  used  in  intravenous  medicinal  products.  The  final  Rapiscan  formulation  is  shown  to  be 
compatible with the terminal sterilization which is proposed for the commercial production process. The 
results of a freeze-thaw study, performed on the finished product, confirm that no precipitate is formed 
when Rapiscan is exposed to low temperatures during transportation or external handling. 
2.2.3.2. 
 Adventitious agents 
No materials of animal or human origin are used in the manufacture of Rapiscan. Therefore there is no 
BSE/TSE risk.  
2.2.3.3. 
 Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for Rapiscan solution for injection consists of compounding, filtration, filling, 
stoppering,  capping,  terminal  sterilization,  inspection,  and  packaging.  The  manufacturing  process  has 
been  adequately  described  and  validated.  Critical  steps  have  been  identified  and  in  process  controls 
are  in  place.  The  manufacturing  process  demonstrates  to  be  reproducible  and  provides  a  finished 
product that complies with the finished product specifications. 
2.2.3.4. 
 Product specification 
The  medicinal  product  specifications  for  Rapiscan  at  batch  release  include  the  following  tests: 
appearance, colour, identity (UV, HPLC) and assay (HPLC) of regadenoson and impurities (HPLC), pH, 
particulate  matter,  bacterial  endotoxins,  sterility  and  volume  in  container.  The  proposed  test 
procedures and acceptance criteria follow the principles of the relevant ICH Guidelines (Q6A, Q3C(R3), 
Q3B(R2) and Q2(R1) and the product specifications are considered suitable to control the quality of the 
finished product, manufactured with the above manufacturing process. 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 7/43
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data 
have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is 
controlled.  All  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) except monobasic sodium phosphate which complies with the USP monograph. 
Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of 
view of safety. Batch analysis results comply with the proposed specification and confirm consistency & 
uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines2, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.5. 
 Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  under  long  term  (25°C/60% RH)  and  accelerated 
(40°C/75% RH) conditions according to the ICH requirements for three registration batches (the scale 
is  20%  of  the  maximum commercial batch  size).  Thirty-six months  stability  data  have  been  provided 
under  long  term  conditions  and  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions.  These  batches  were 
manufactured at the proposed site of finished product manufacture, according to the proposed process 
and  with  the  active  substance  obtained  from  the  registered  active  substance  manufacturer.  The 
batches were packaged as proposed for marketing (in a 5 mL Type I (clear) glass vial closed with a 13 
mm  rubber  stopper  and  flip  off  overseal).  The  parameters  tested  and  analytical  methods  used  were 
identical to those at batch release, except from the test for identity and volume in container which are 
not  repeated  at  the  end  of  shelf-life.  In  addition  to  the  stability  data  on  registration  batches, 
supplementary  long  term  and  accelerated  stability  data  have  been  provided  on  one  batch 
manufactured  with  regadenoson  provided  by  another  supplier,  not  registered  in  the  initial  Rapiscan 
marketing authorisation. 
Further  supplementary  stability  data  was  provided  for  three  phase  3  clinical  trial  batches.  The  three 
batches  were  manufactured  at  the  proposed  site  of  finished  product  manufacture  and  placed  on 
stability at accelerated (40°C/75% RH) and long-term storage (25°C/60% RH) conditions. Two batches 
contained  a  slightly  higher  regadenoson  concentration  than  the  commercial  formula,  the  third  batch 
was manufactured at the proposed commercial concentration. These batches were all aseptically filled, 
but  not  terminally  sterilized.  All  batches  were  manufactured  at  20%  of  the  proposed  maximum 
commercial batch size. The active substance used for manufacturing of these batches was provided by 
a supplier which is not authorised in the initial Rapiscan marketing authorisation. 
Furthermore,  a  photostability  study  was  performed  on  one  registration  batch  in  accordance  with  ICH 
Q1B under lighting option 2. Samples were exposed to a total of not less than 1.2 million lux-h under 
cool  white  fluorescent  light  and  200  Watt-h/m2  of  near  ultraviolet  (UVA)  lamp  light.  Light  protected 
control  samples  were  exposed  in  the  same  manner  and  tested  in  parallel  with  the  light  exposed 
samples.  A  comparison  of  the  light  exposed  and  control  (light  protected)  samples  indicates  that 
Regadenoson  Injection  in  5  ml  Type  I  clear  glass  vials  is  not  light  sensitive.  The  secondary  package, 
therefore, does not enhance the stability of the drug product. 
A freeze/thaw study was conducted on one phase 3 clinical batch. The study was conducted using vials 
in  upright  and  inverted  orientations.  Samples  were  stored  at  -20°C  for  48  hours,  then  moved  to 
25°C/60% RH for two hours, then moved to 40°C/75% RH for 48 hours, then moved to 25°C/60% RH 
for two hours and then moved back to -20°C for another cycle. This cycle was repeated three times. 
The stability results presented are satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially 
packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on manufacture, control and stability of the active substance and medicinal product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The excipients are commonly used in this type of formulation 
and  comply  with  Ph  Eur  or  USP.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have 
been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Batch analysis results indicate consistency 
and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion 
that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the  clinic.  Stability  tests

performed  under  ICH  conditions  indicate  that  the  product  is  chemically  stable  for  the  proposed  shelf 
life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  quality  of  Rapiscan  is  adequately  established.  Satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. At the time of the CHMP opinion there are no unresolved quality issues 
which have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Regadenoson  is  a  selective  adenosine  A2A-receptor  agonist  with  a  low  affinity  for  the  receptor,  which 
results in a shorter duration of action than higher affinity compounds. 
The non-clinical development of regadenoson has been designed in accordance with EU/ICH guidelines. 
The in vitro safety pharmacology studies that evaluated effects on human Ether-à-go-go related gene 
(hERG) channels and in Purkinje fibres, as well as those studies investigating effects on respiratory and 
nervous systems were carried out in accordance with relevant guidance and in compliance with Good 
Laboratory  Practice  (GLP).  Additional  studies  into  the  cardiovascular  effects  were  reported  under 
secondary pharmacodynamics and were not conducted in compliance with GLP. These non-GLP studies 
were  not  considered  to  compromise  the  scientific  integrity  or  affect  the  experimental  results.  The 
pivotal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  guidance  and  in  compliance 
with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In  radioligand  binding  and  functional  assays  in  vitro  regadenoson  has  been  shown  to  be  a  selective 
adenosine A2A-receptor agonist with low affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [Ki] ~1.2 μM).  In 
in vitro studies in perfused rat and guinea pig hearts, regadenoson produced dose-dependent increases 
in coronary vasodilation.  
A  large  reserve  of  A2A-receptors  was  found  in  guinea  pig  heart,  with  activation  of  about  4%  of  the 
receptors by regadenoson producing half of the maximum possible response. 
Regadenoson dose-dependently increased coronary blood flow (CBF) in conscious dogs with an ED50 of 
0.34  μg/kg  and  was  more  potent  than  adenosine  (ED50  of  51  μg/kg),  although  both  were  equally 
effective,  producing  similar  maximal  increases  in  CBF  of  about  220%.  The  duration  of  the  2-fold 
increase  in  CBF  observed  following  administration  of  an  iv  bolus  of  regadenoson  increased  with  the 
dose  administered,  and  with  the  duration  of  the  bolus  injection  (10  vs.  30  sec).  The  increase  in  CBF 
was  associated  with  an  increase  in  heart  rate  and  a  decrease  in  mean  arterial  pressure.  In  ECG 
recordings, transient T wave inversion was seen with both regadenoson and adenosine. 
Tachyphylaxis was not observed following 3 consecutive doses of 1μg/kg. 
In  the  study  with  anesthetized  dogs  regadenoson  caused  a  2.6-fold  increase  in  coronary  artery 
average peak velocity (APV), but only a 1.3-fold increase in forelimb artery APV. Adenosine produced a 
2.5-fold  increase  in  coronary  artery  APV  and  a  2.0-fold  increase  in  forelimb  artery  APV.  In  another 
study with anesthetized dogs regadenoson increased APV by 3.1-, 1.4-, 1.2- and 1.1-fold in coronary, 
brain, forelimb and pulmonary arteries, respectively.

2.3.2.2. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Regadenoson  at  dose  range  6.7–800  mg/kg  in  awake  rats  caused  a  dose-  and  time-dependent 
decrease  in  BP  and  increase  in  HR.  Plasma  norepinephrine  (NE)  and  epinephrine  (EPI)  levels  were 
increased  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  Regadenoson  shortened  rather  than  prolonged  QT  interval in 
conscious dogs over the dose range 2.5 to 10 μg/kg. 
Regadenoson  had  no  significant  effect  on  delayed  rectifier  currents  (IKr  and  IKs)  in  isolated  dog  left 
ventricular  myocytes  at  concentrations  up  to  10μM  and  had  no  effect  on  action  potential  duration  in 
isolated  rabbit  hearts  at  concentrations  up  to  30μM,  suggesting  that  there  is  little  risk  of  ventricular 
arrhythmias. 
2.3.2.3. 
 Safety pharmacology programme 
In  addition  to  the  (non-GLP)  studies  reported  above,  in  vitro  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance 
with ICH guidance S7B and in compliance with GLP, to investigate effects on ventricular repolarisation 
and arrhythmias.  
Regadenoson  at  5μM  had  no  effect  on  hERG  tail  current  in  stably  transfected  HEK  293  cells,  and  at 
concentrations up to 10 μM did not alter action potential parameters in isolated canine Purkinje fibres. 
Regadenoson had no significant effects on respiratory function in anaesthetised rats at doses up to 200 
μg/kg iv. 
In  behavioural  studies  using  Irwin  test,  regadenoson  decreased  spontaneous  activity  at  200 μg/kg  in 
one study and decreased abdominal tone and activity at 400 μg/kg in another. Hypothermia was seen 
in  both  studies  (from  80  μg/kg).  The  effects  were  transient  and  considered  to  be  related  to  the 
reduction  in  median  arterial  pressure  (MAP).  The  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  CVT3146.033-P 
and  CVT3146.055-P  suggest  that  the  regadenoson-dependent  rank  order  of  effect  was  coronary  >> 
brain  >  forelimb  >  pulmonary  artery;  study  CVT  3146.055-P  shows  an  increased  blood  flow  in  the 
brain at 1 μg/kg.   
2.3.2.4. 
 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-selective antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine at iv doses up to 10 mg/kg did not affect 
the regadenoson-induced peak increase in CBF in conscious dogs, but dose-dependently decreased the 
duration of the effect. Caffeine also attenuated the regadenoson-induced decrease in MAP and increase 
in heart rate. Interactions with dopaminergic drugs are not expected. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single  iv  doses  of  2,  20,  200  μg/kg  regadenoson  administered  to  male  rats  showed  linear  kinetics, 
rapid clearance, moderate volume of distribution and short terminal half life. In a study using a wider 
range  of  doses,  the  AUC  of  regadenoson  increased  greater  than  proportional  to  dose  at  higher  doses 
(200-  800  μg/kg).  At  dose  level  50  μg/kg  and  above,  the  peak  concentrations  and  AUC  of  both 
norepinephrine and epinephrine increased dose-dependently and it was consistent with the increases in 
heart rate.  In the subsequent repeated-dose toxicity studies in the rat, there was no evidence of drug 
accumulation or gender differences. 
In female rabbits, values of AUC for regadenoson generally increased proportionally to the increase in 
dose  over  the  range  of  100–500  μg/kg  and  clearance,  volume  of  distribution  and  elimination  half-life 
did not change significantly over this dose range.  
In  dogs  following  single  iv  doses  of  2,  20  and  200  μg/kg  regadenoson  exhibited  rapid  clearance, 
moderate volume of distribution and short terminal half life. 
Plasma  protein  binding  of  regadenoson  was  moderate,  ranging  from  9.6  to  24%.  In  rat  and  dog, 
regadenoson was predominantly distributed into plasma, with blood: plasma ratios <1. In humans, the 
blood:plasma distribution ratio was slightly greater than 1. 
Distribution  studies  in  male  rats  showed  rapid  and  wide  distribution  of  regadenoson,  with  peaks  in 
most tissues occurring at the first sampling time of 30 minutes post-dose. Lowest levels were seen in 
the  brain.  Measurable  levels  were  still  found  in  the  lung  at  120h  post-dose,  and  in  pigmented  rats, 
EMA/455580/2010

radioactivity was still associated with the uveal tract and pigmented skin at this time point, suggesting 
binding to melanin.  
In vivo, regadenoson appeared to  be  metabolically stable in dogs, and was  metabolised to a minimal 
extent  in  rats,  with  two  minor  metabolites  (a  de-ribosylated  derivative  [CVT-8451]  and  a  glucose 
conjugate of regadenoson) found in urine, and CVT-8451 also found in bile (<1% of the dose).  
Regadenoson was not metabolised by human liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro, and <2% was 
converted to metabolites by rat and dog microsomes.  The in vitro results with rat and dog microsomes 
support the in vivo results showing minimal/no metabolism in these species. The incubations were only 
carried  out  for  30  minutes,  but  the  in  vitro  recovery  of  the  regadenoson  dose  was  almost  complete 
within this time in microsomal incubations from rat, dog and humans, and was similar across species.   
Regadenoson did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at concentrations 
up to 100µM. 
Excretion of radioactivity was rapid, with biliary elimination being an important route in both rats and 
dogs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1. 
 Single dose toxicity 
Regadenoson was well tolerated in rats (i.v. dose up to 1500 μg/kg) and dogs (i.v. doses up to 2400 
μg/kg).  Pharmacological  effects  (increases  in  heart  rate  and  pulse  rate,  decreases  in  blood  pressure 
and  T  wave  inversion  on  ECG)  were  seen  in  the  dogs.  The  NOEL  for  T  wave  inversion  in  dogs  was 
established  at  1  μg/kg  in  a  subsequent  single  escalating  dose  study.  In  this  study,  QTc  interval 
increased immediately after dosing, but returned to normal by 5 minutes after the dose. 
A  comparative  study  was  conducted  in  rats  to  bridge  between  the  repeated-dose  studies  where  a 
vehicle  containing  methyl  boronic  acid  (MBA)  was  used,  and  the  commercial  formulation  containing 
propylene  glycol  (PG).  A  reddish  discolouration  of  urine  was  seen  in  PG  groups  and  it  was  consistent 
with slight hemolysis due to the high volume administered or to possible changes in isotonicity. These 
effects  were  not  observed  at  lower  administration  volumes  either  of  PG  or  MBA  formulations. 
Subsequent  in  vitro  studies  showed  that  the  vehicle  was  not  haemolytic  to  human  blood.  The  only 
treatment-related  finding  with  both  formulations  (PG  and  MBA)  was  a  dose-related  increase  in 
incidence of reversible cardiomyopathy at a high regadenoson dose (200 µg/kg). The toxicity profile of 
the two formulations was similar. 
In  the  pharmacokinetic  study  in  rats  supratherapeutic  doses  of  ≥  200  μg/kg  were  associated  with  a 
marked, sustained, decrease in MAP. The findings are not likely to be relevant at the clinical dose.  
2.3.4.2. 
 Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Elevations in CK levels were seen in rats at the end of a 7-day study and the end of recovery in a 28-
day study, at the high dose of 200 µg/kg/day. In neither case there were any histopathological findings 
in  the  skeletal  or  cardiac  muscles  and  the  finding  was  not  considered  toxicologically  relevant.  The 
NOAEL was therefore the high-dose of 200 µg/kg/day in these studies. 
In  7-day  and  28-day  studies  in  dogs,  changes  in  T  wave  morphology  were  observed  at  20  and  200 
µg/kg  in  the  7-day  study  and  at  200  µg/kg  in  the  28-day  study.  An  increased  heart  rate  and 
shortening  of  the  RR  interval  was  noted  during  week  3.  During  week  4,  a  T  wave  inversion  and 
prominent elevation and arch of the ST segment were seen at 200 μg/kg/day. No other findings were 
seen in the dogs. The NOAEL in the dog studies was 200 µg/kg/day. 
2.3.4.3. 
 Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of genotoxicity studies was conducted in accordance with relevant guidance and in 
compliance with GLP. Regadenoson showed no genotoxic potential in this standard battery.  
2.3.4.4. 
 Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  conducted.  The  absence  of  carcinogenicity  studies  is  adequately 
justified.  The  absence  of  carcinogenicity  studies  is  justified  based  on  the  negative  results  in  the 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 11/43
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genotoxicity  battery  and  the  intended  clinical  (single)  use.  The  applicant  also  provided  further 
justification in that there is no concern about carcinogenic potential from the product class, structure-
activity relationships, repeated-dose toxicity studies, or long-term tissue retention. 
2.3.4.5. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
Embryo-fetal developmental studies were conducted in rats and rabbits, with doses selected following 
appropriate  dose  range-finding  studies.  In  rats,  maternal  toxicity  included  decreased  motor  activity, 
excessive  salivation  and  decreased  body  weight  and  food  consumption.  In  rabbits,  maternal  toxicity 
was  manifest  as  tachypnea  immediately  after  dosing,  increased  incidence  of  alopecia,  altered  faeces, 
and reduced body weight gain and food consumption. Fetal toxicity (reduced fetal weights and delays 
in  ossification  of  phalanges)  was  seen  in  rats  at  the  mid-  and  high  doses  (500  and  1000/800  μg/kg, 
respectively),  and  ossification  was  also  delayed  in  the  hindlimb  metatarsals  at  the  high  dose.    In 
rabbits, litter size and the number of live fetuses were reduced, and resorptions increased, at the high 
dose (500 μg/kg). Fetal weight was also reduced at this dose.  
Toxicokinetic  analysis  was  not  undertaken  in  the  definitive  studies  because  maternal  toxicity 
immediately after dosing precluded collection of blood samples.  
The maternal AUC at the NOEL for fetotoxicity was 52 ng.h/mL in rats and 592 ng.h/mL in rabbits.  In 
comparison  with  the  range  of  AUC  values  (12  to  28  ng.h/mL)  obtained  in  clinical  study  CVT  5112, 
these values represent 2- to 4-fold (rats) and 21- to 49-fold (rabbits) exposure margins. 
Using  the  mean  values  of  C2min  for  males  and  females  combined  at  day  28  in  the  repeated-dose  rat 
study, the C2min at a dose of 100 μg/kg (the NOEL for fetotoxicity) is estimated to be about 184 ng/mL. 
In  comparison  with  the  range  of  Cmax  values  (14  to  24  ng/mL)  obtained  in  clinical  studies  CVT  5112 
and  CVT  5121,  this  provides  a  margin  of  about  8-  to  13-fold.    For  rabbits,  C2min  at  300  μg/kg  in  the 
study in non-pregnant females was 2670 ng/mL, which provides a 111- to 190-fold margin compared 
with the human values of Cmax.  
On the basis of administered dose/kg body weight, the NOEL in rats and rabbits was 15- and 45-fold 
higher, respectively, than the clinical dose of 6.7 μg/kg (400 μg administered to a 60 kg person). 
Therefore  the  margin  between  the  NOEL  for  fetotoxicity  and  the  recommended  human  dose  ranged 
from 2- to 15-fold in rats and 21- to 190-fold in rabbits, depending on the basis of the comparison with 
clinical values.  
Regadenoson  was  not  teratogenic  in  rats  or  rabbits  at  the  highest  doses  tested  (800  and  500 μg/kg, 
respectively).  
2.3.4.6. 
 Toxicokinetic data 
In  the  repeated-dose  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  the  highest  concentrations  of  regadenoson  were 
measured  about  2  min  post-dose.  There  was  no  significant  gender  difference  in  either  species,  and 
values of AUC at the end of the 7- or 28-day studies were similar to those after the initial dose. 
The exposure multiples in terms of AUC at the NOAEL of 200 μg/kg in rats and dogs were about 3 to 9-
fold and 3 to 10-fold, respectively, the AUC values obtained in subjects with normal renal function and 
with various stages of renal impairment.  
2.3.4.7. 
 Local Tolerance  
The proposed vehicle (propylene glycol [PG]) containing 100μg/mL regadenoson was not haemolytic in 
human whole blood. Regadenoson in the same vehicle was not an irritant to rabbits in local tolerance 
studies when administered via the intravenous, intra-arterial, perivenous or subcutaneous routes. The 
intra-arterial,  perivenous  and  subcutaneous  studies  employed  the  commercial  formulation  (80  μg/mL 
regadenoson in 15% PG).  
2.3.4.8. 
 Other toxicity studies 
Process  impurity  2-HA  is  limited  in  the  drug  substance  to  the  concentration  which  is  well  below  the 
threshold for toxicological concerns. The toxicity of two other drug substance impurities, CVT-3145 and 
N6-methyl  CVT-3146,  were  investigated  in  a  single-dose  toxicity  study,  in  vitro  genotoxicity  studies, 
and the 7- and 28-day repeated-dose studies in rats and dogs.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  Phase  I  estimation  of  environmental  exposure  produced  a  value  for  PECSURFACE WATER  that  was  lower 
than  the  trigger  value  for  a  Phase  II  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis.    Consequently 
regadenoson is not considered to pose a risk to the environment.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Two  studies  in  anaesthetised  dogs  showed  regadenoson  to  be  selective  for  the  coronary  over  the 
peripheral  arteries,  and  to  be  more  selective  than  adenosine  in  this  respect.  The  high  potency  of 
regadenoson has been attributed to the ‘spare receptor’ hypothesis.  
Studies in conscious rats suggest that regadenoson-induced increases in HR are mediated via a direct 
effect  on  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  as  plasma  levels  of  norepinephrine  and  epinephrine  are 
increased  in  a  dose-related  manner.  However,  at  supratherapeutic  doses  of  regadenoson,  the 
baroreceptor  reflex  may  also  be  involved,  as  a  result  of  hypotension  resulting  from  significant 
peripheral vasodilation.  
As  described  in  the  section  on  safety  pharmacology  regadenoson  causes  decreases  in  spontaneous 
activity  and  in  abdominal  tone  as  well  as  hypothermia.  The  regadenoson  vasodilatory  effect  on  the 
cerebral  arteries  at  low  doses  is  thought  to  be  responsible  for  the  cephaleas  observed  in  the  clinical 
setting.  Spontaneous  motor  activity,  hypothermia  and  decreased  abdominal  tone  were  observed  at 
doses highly exceeding the clinical dose.  However, it is considered a limitation that exposure margins 
have  not  been  provided.  Nevertheless,  these  effects  are  not  expected  at  regadenoson  therapeutic 
doses.  
Binding to melanin may suggest that regadenoson has the potential to cause phototoxicity and this has 
been discussed adequately by the applicant.   
Regadenoson  is  selective,  but  not  specific  for  the  A2A-receptor,  and  the  safety  pharmacology  studies 
did not indicate a particular concern with regard to respiratory effects, but adverse respiratory effects 
have been reported in the clinical trials. The mechanism of distribution and relatively slow clearance of 
radioactivity  from  the  lung  of  rats  is  unknown.    The  widespread  distribution  of  the  A2A  adenosine 
receptor 
in  effects  such  as  arterial  vasodilatation, 
sympathomimetic  excitation,  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation,  inhibition  of  inflammatory  cells  (e.g. 
neutrophils) and processes, including reducing airway hyper-responsiveness, is noted.  
is  acknowledged,  and 
involvement 
its 
In the safety pharmacology studies, regadenoson at 200 μg/kg (IV) caused an increase in respiratory 
rate  in  mice  but  no  effects  on  other  respiratory  parameters  measured.  The  toxicology  studies  in  rats 
and dogs showed no histopathological lesions following IV dosing for up to 28 days. Therefore the non-
clinical studies do not suggest any particular concerns with regard to respiratory effects. The ability of 
regadenoson  to  increase  plasma  epinephrine  and  norepinephine  levels  has  been  demonstrated  in  the 
pharmacology  studies.    Therefore  the  effects  of  regadenoson  on  respiratory  function  appear  to  be  a 
result  of  sympathoexcitation  rather  than  a  deleterious  effect  on  pulmonary  function.    Consequently, 
although the mechanism of distribution of radioactivity to, and slow clearance from, the lung of rats is 
not known, there does not appear to be any clinical implication of these findings.   
As  regadenoson  is  largely  cleared  from  plasma  in  30  minutes  in  all  species  studied  and  incubations 
with  human  hepatocytes  for  4  hours,  with  appropriate  positive  controls,  showed  no  metabolism  of 
regadenoson, the conclusion from in vitro data that regadenoson is not metabolised in humans seems 
reasonable. In addition the absence of in vivo mass balance studies in humans was supported by the 
argument that it was not considered appropriate to expose individuals to radioactive regadenoson.  
Given the metabolic stability of regadenoson and the lack of inhibition of CYP isozymes demonstrated 
in vitro, there seems little likelihood of regadenoson interacting with other drugs that are metabolised 
by  cytochrome  P450  isozymes  and  the  absence  of  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  is  acceptable. 
This is adequately covered in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
In  the  single  dose  toxicity  study  QTc  interval  increased  immediately  after  dosing,  but  returned  to 
normal  by  5  minutes  after  the  dose.  The  transient  prolongation  of  the  QTc  interval  observed  after  a 
regadenoson-induced increase in HR was explained mechanistically as the result of a momentary delay 
(lag) in establishing a stable (shorter) QT interval immediately following such an abrupt increase in HR. 
That  is,  shortening  of  the  QT  interval  lags  behind  the  shortening  of  the  RR  interval  after  a  sudden 
increase in HR (hysteresis), leading to transient prolongation of the QTc interval when not corrected for 
EMA/455580/2010

delay  in  QT adaptation  to  the  increase  in  HR.  The potential  of  regadenoson  to  affect  QT  prolongation 
will be further addressed from a clinical point of view.  
The only toxicity effect reported in the single-dose bridging study with both formulations (PG and MBA) 
consisted  of  reversible  minimal  cardiomyopathy  due  to  the  large  reduction  in  blood  pressure  at  high 
regadenoson dose (200 µg/kg). Repeat-dose toxicity studies with MBA formulation did not reveal any 
toxic effect. Therefore, considering the general lack of toxic effects and the reproducibility of the only 
observed  effect  in  the  bridging  single  dose  study  between  the  two  formulations,  it  is  considered 
acceptable to extrapolate data from the preliminary to the definitive formulation. 
The  duration  of  repeated-dose  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  (7  and  28  days  respectively)  is  acceptable  to 
cover the intended single dose administration in man.  
Fertility  studies  were  not  performed  because  there  were  no  histopathological  effects  in  reproductive 
organs  following  repeated  intravenous  administration  of  regadenoson  for  28  days  to  rats  and  dogs. 
Also effects on postnatal development of the offspring were not evaluated because regadenoson is not 
intended  to  be  used  in  women  with  late-stage  pregnancy.  In  addition,  studies  involving  treatment  of 
juvenile animals are not applicable because regadenoson is not indicated for paediatric use. 
For  regadenoson,  with  a  short  duration  of  pharmacodynamic  action  when  plasma  levels  are  highest, 
safety margins may be more usefully expressed on the basis of Cmax values rather than AUC.  Based on 
the  range  of  Cmax  values  in  clinical  studies  the  C2min  values  at  the  NOAEL  in  rats  and  dogs  were  8-  to 
13-fold  and  17-  to  29-fold  higher,  respectively,  based  on  average  male  and  female  values  at  200 
μg/kg/day in the 7- and 28-day studies. The proposed clinical dose of 400µg equates to a dose of 6.7 
µg/kg for a 60kg person, which has a similar pharmacological effect to the same dose (6.7 µg/kg) in 
rats. Therefore the margins between the human dose and the NOAEL in the repeated-dose studies may 
also  be  expressed  on  the  basis  of  administered  dose  per  kg  body  weight, which  would give  a  30-fold 
margin.  
In  conclusion,  the  safety  margins  between  the  clinical  dose  and  the  NOAEL  in  the  repeated  dose 
toxicity studies ranged from 3 to 30-fold and are considered acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  studies  show  that  regadenoson  has  appropriate  pharmacology  and  toxicology  for  the 
intended clinical use. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  regadenoson  program  consists  of  10  clinical  studies  that  are  summarised  in  the  table  below. 
Studies CVT 5131 and CVT 5132 were the pivotal studies for the claimed indication. The dose response 
studies consisted of three studies - CVT 5111, CVT 5112 and CVT 5121. Clinical trials included healthy 
volunteers, renal impaired subjects, subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization, patients with mild to 
moderate asthma, patients with moderate and severe COPD and the target population. 
No formal Scientific Advice has been given by the CHMP for this medicinal product.   
The indication as claimed by the applicant was: 
“Rapiscan is a selective coronary vasodilator for use as a pharmacological stress agent for radionuclide 
myocardial perfusion imaging in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress.” 
This indication has been endorsed by CHMP. 
2.4.2.  GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.4.3.1. 
 Absorption  
The  intended  route  of  administration  of  regadenoson  is  by  rapid  (≤10  sec)  iv  injection,  and  thus  no 
specific absorption studies have been conducted for the program. 
2.4.3.2. 
 Distribution 
The initial half-life of regadenoson is 2 to 4 minutes, the intermediate half-life 30 minutes with a large 
between-subject  variability,  and  the  terminal  half-life  2  hours.  In  the  initial  phase  of  distribution,  the 
regadenoson  plasma  concentration  declined  to  less  than  50%  of  the  peak  concentration  within  5 
minutes.  
In CVT 5111, the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 20 g/kg. The observed Cmax 
concentrations at this dose level ranged from 69–134 ng/mL. At the dose of 30 g/kg, three subjects 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 15/43
 
  
 
 
 
 
experienced intolerable adverse events (AEs) consistent with the pharmacologic action of regadenoson. 
AEs  considered  intolerable  by  the  subjects  formed  the  basis  for  the  MTD.  The  regadenoson  Cmax 
concentrations  after  a  dose  of  30  g/kg  ranged  from  98–196  ng/mL  (mean  134  ng/mL).  Plasma 
concentrations of regadenoson above 100 ng/mL may, therefore, be associated with poor tolerability.  
The average Cmax concentration observed in CVT 5112, CVT 5121, CVT 5131, and CVT 5132 after the 
400  g  dose  ranged  from  14–24  ng/mL.  The  PK  and  safety  results  demonstrate  that,  after  a  400  g 
dose of regadenoson, patients are unlikely to achieve plasma regadenoson concentrations shown to be 
associated with intolerability. 
In  CVT  5112,  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  function  received  a  400  g  iv  of  regadenoson. 
Total  clearance  (CL)  of  regadenoson  was  reduced  in  parallel  with  the  reduction  in  renal  function; 
however,  Cmax  as  well  as  the  PK  parameters  associated  with  distribution,  showed  only  minor 
differences between the groups. 
2.4.3.3. 
 Elimination 
Regadenoson  is  excreted  approximately  equally  between  urine  and  bile,  and  almost  entirely  as 
unchanged drug. In healthy human subjects administered a single iv dose of regadenoson in CVT 5111 
(0.1–30  g/kg)  and  CVT  5112  (400  g),  approximately  57%–65%  of  the  dose  was  recovered 
unchanged  in  urine.  Accordingly,  the  likelihood  of  drug-drug  interactions  affecting  regadenoson 
clearance  at  the  metabolic  level  is  expected  to  be  negligible,  and  therefore  PK  drug-drug  interaction 
studies  and  a  study  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  have  not  been  conducted  with  regadenoson. 
Further,  the  study  conducted  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (CVT  5112)  provides  evidence  that 
factors affecting the clearance of regadenoson are unlikely to affect the PK parameters associated with 
distribution  of  the  drug  in  the  early  stages  after  dosing  and  associated  with  peak  pharmacologic 
activity. Regadenoson does not inhibit the major human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4) and, therefore, is unlikely to affect the plasma concentrations 
of  other  drugs.    Regadenoson  is  moderately  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  (25%–30%)  and  does 
not distribute extensively into red blood cells. 
2.4.3.4. 
 Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  the  study  CVT  5111  peak  plasma  concentrations  of  regadenoson  were  attained  rapidly  following 
dosing  (1.02-4.02  min),  and,  thereafter,  there  was  evidence  of  a  time-dependent  multi-exponential 
decline  in  plasma  concentration.  Estimates  indicative  of  systemic  exposure  increased  broadly  in 
proportion  to  dose,  although  there  was  a  suggestion of  a  less  than  proportional increase  as  the  dose 
increased  from  20  to  30  μg/kg.  However,  formal  statistical  analysis  of  the  AUC(0-∞)  estimates 
supported  dose  proportionality  between  0.3  and  30  g/kg.  Subjects  with  lower  GFR  had  lower 
clearances  which  resulted  in  higher  AUC  values.  Asian  subjects  had  marginally  lower  clearances  than 
the typical subject and would, therefore, have higher exposures. 
2.4.3.5. 
 Special populations 
Impaired hepatic function 
In the study CVT 5111 the predicted regadenoson  CL values were 39.4, 28.7, 17.8, and 12.4 L/h for 
CLCR  values  of  120,  80,  40,  and  20  mL/min,  respectively.  This  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  CVT 
5112  showing regadenoson CL values of 35, 26, 20, and 15  L/h for CLCR values for each of the four 
renal function groups of 97, 60, 35, and 19 mL/min, respectively. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Metabolism  does  not  play  a  significant  role  in  elimination  of  regadenoson.  Accordingly,  a  study  in 
subjects with hepatic impairment is not considered relevant. 
Gender 
The population PK modeling analysis concluded that there is a minor influence of gender on CL with a 
difference of less than 15% from a reference individual. 
Race 
The population PK modeling analysis showed a minor influence of race on CL with a difference of less 
than 15% from a reference individual of Caucasian race. 
Weight

The  population  PK  modeling  analysis  concluded  that  the  central  volume  of  distribution  increased 
moderately  with  weight.  There  was  also  minor  influence  of  either  body  weight  or  BMI  on  CL  with  a 
difference of less than 15% (point estimate) from a reference individual with weight of 70 kg or BMI of 
25 kg/m2, respectively. 
Elderly 
The  population  PK  modeling  analysis  concluded  that  there  is  a  minor  influence  of  age  on  CL  with  a 
difference of less than 15% (point estimate) from a reference individual. 
Children 
No studies have been conducted. 
2.4.3.6. 
 Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  interaction  studies  have  been  carried  out.    Metabolism  does  not  play  a  significant  role  in  the 
elimination  of  regadenoson,  and  the  drug  does  not  inhibit  any  of  the  major  human  cytochrome  P450 
enzymes.  The  likelihood  of  drug-drug  interactions  affecting  regadenoson  clearance  at  the  metabolic 
level  or  the  plasma  concentrations  of  other  drugs  is  negligible.  This  is  considered  an  acceptable 
justification. 
2.4.3.7. 
 Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Plasma protein binding study demonstrated moderate binding to human plasma proteins (25%–30%). 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.4.4.1. 
 Mechanism of action 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  Regadenoson  is  AMP  dependent  stimulation  as  with  adenosine. 
Regadenoson is a selective A2A-AdoR agonist, with at least 10-fold lower affinity for the A1-AdoR, and 
weak, if any, affinity for the A2B- and A3-AdoRs. Activation of the A2A-AdoR by regadenoson produces 
coronary  vasodilatation  and  increases  CBF.  Despite  low  affinity  for  the  A2A-AdoR,  regadenoson  has 
high potency for increasing coronary conductance (coronary vasodilatation) in isolated, rat and guinea-
pig  hearts.  Regadenoson  increases  HR  through  a  direct  stimulation  of  cardiac  sympathetic  activity 
and/or  an  indirect,  reflex  sympathetic  response  (or  vagal  withdrawal)  to  a  decrease  in  peripheral 
vascular resistance. A concentration-dependent increase in HR has been observed in all clinical studies 
with regadenoson. Onset is rapid, and the maximum effect is typically observed within 1 to 2 minutes 
after drug administration. 
2.4.4.2. 
 Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PK-PD  modelling  for  the  HR  effect  has  been  performed  for  CVT  5121,  and  a  population  analysis  has 
been conducted with combined data for CVT 5131 and CVT 5132 using the target population.   
Regadenoson  shows  the  maximum  effect  on  CBF  as  anticipated.  And  there  appears  to  be  a  direct 
impact  on  the  heart  rate  based  on  direct  sympathostimulatory  effect  in  the  carotid  sinus  via  the 
baroreceptor  mechanisms.  A  moderate  linear  relation  between  heart  rate  &  dose  was  seen  although 
the interpretation of this is limited. The absence of dose related drop in BP (SBP and DBP) is reassuring 
and lends support to the specificity of regadenoson action on the coronary vasculature in preference to 
the peripheral vasculature. This is beneficial in this setting although it could be hypothesized that this 
may  limit  ability  to  induce  ischaemia  due  to  lack  of  effect  on  cardiac  output  and  stroke  volume.  This 
however remains hypothetical given that some subjects had a drop in BP. The applicant was asked and 
has  provided  a  discussion  on  the  effect  of  concomitant  medications  such  as  betablockers  or 
vasodilators.  Patients  included  in  phase  III  studies  were  analysed  by  group  of  cardioactive  treatment 
(β-blocker, calcium channel blocker, nitrate, ACE Inhibitor, Angiotensin II receptor blockers) for heart 
rate, blood pressure and first degree A-V block. The results of the analysis by groups shows that there 
was  a  lower  increase  in  heart  rate  and  a  higher  decrease  in  blood  pressure  in  those  who  took 
cardioactive  medication  compared  with  those  who  did  not  take  cardioactive  medication.  Hypotension 
was  slightly  higher  in  the  group  with  cardioactive  medication,  especially  for  β-blockers  (2%  with 
cardioactive meds vs <1% without) and first-degree AV block was also slightly higher in the group with 
cardioactive medication especially for calcium channel blockers (3.2% taken vs 2.8 % not taken).  The 
EMA/455580/2010

use  of  concomitant  vasodilatory  medications  had  no  significant  additive  effect  either  for  efficacy  or 
tolerance of regadenoson (see also safety section).  
Secondary  pharmacology  predominantly  relates  to  bronchoconstrictive  effect  and  secondary  effect  on 
QT  dependent  on  the  change  in  heart  rate.  Clinically  important  bronchial  responses  to  regadenoson 
were tested in two small clinical studies; CVCT 5124 and CVT 5125. As both studies were small (~50 
subjects  each),  and  they  could  not  provide  definitive  evidence  for  the  effect  of  regadenoson  on 
bronchoconstriction;  however,  both  studies  demonstrated  that  regadenoson  and  placebo  had  similar 
effects  on  FEV1.  In  the  asthma  study  there  were  subjects  with  20  and  30%  reduction  in  FEV1  in  the 
regadenoson  group.    When  viewed  in  conjunction  with  symptoms  of  dyspnoea  this  raises  a  question 
regarding specificity of regadenoson to A2A-AdoR. The dyspnoea noted with regadenoson is most likely 
due  to  sympathoexcitation  with  little  impact  on  A-2A  receptors.  More  importantly,  additional  studies 
are  planned  in  patients  with  obstructive  airway  disease  The  issue  of  lung  deposition  of  regadenoson 
and  the  safety  aspects  have  been  discussed  in  the  relevant  section  (non-clinical  and  clinical  safety 
respectively). 
Preclinical data provide evidence that regadenoson does not affect ventricular repolarisation or the QT 
interval  when  HR  is  constant.  Regadenoson  administered  by  iv  bolus  to  conscious  dogs  caused  a 
transient  increase  in  HR  with  an  expected  concomitant  shortening  of  the  QT  interval.  The  results  of 
these two studies (CVT3146.117-hERG channels, CVT3146.118-P dog myocyte) indicate that the drug 
does not have an effect on ventricular repolarisation. The applicant has discussed the relation between 
QT/ QTc and the increase in heart rate. The initial apparent marginal change (increase) in QT interval 
is attributed to a “hysteresis effect” (lag time for increase in HR) and this is plausible. The overall issue 
of importance is that regadenoson does not have a significant measurable effect on QT interval.  
The  limited  interaction  studies  conducted  suggest  that  aminophylline  reverses  the  effects  of 
regadenoson  by  binding  to  the  same  receptors.  Caffeine  may  reduce  effectiveness  of  regadenoson 
although the evidence to quantify and support this is not strong. Data from study CVT 5123 in healthy 
subjects  who  took  oral  caffeine  (200  mg)  or  placebo  approximately  2  hours  prior  to  regadenoson 
administration,  show  that  following  regadenoson,  the  median  CFR  (coronary  flow  reserve)  in 
caffeinated subjects was at least 80% of the CFR in non-caffeinated subjects.  The major implication of 
interaction  with  theophyllines  remains  that  aminophylline  could  be  used  to  reverse  effects  of 
regadenoson  and  also  that  it  may  be  best  to  avoid  caffeine  containing  beverages  prior  to  a 
pharmacological  stress  test.  There  are  no  other  specific  clinically  relevant  interactions  e.g., 
betablockers  on  heart  rate  and  vasodilators  on  blood  pressure  that  is,  when  regadenoson  is 
administered.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A  fixed  dosing  scheme  is  proposed  at  400µg  and  this  is  reasonably  well  supported.  Higher  doses 
(500µg  tested)  do  not  improve  quality  of  the  imaging.  Dose  linearity  and  proportionality  have  been 
adequately studied.  Dose proportionality and time dependency do not play a significant role except for 
defining  the  terminal  elimination  half  life  of  2  hours.  Regadenoson  is  metabolically  stable  with  little 
potential  to  interact  with  CYP  450  enzyme  system.  There  does  not  appear  to  be  an  identifiable 
significant  role  for  transporters.  The  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  studied  as  required  and  the 
reasons  for  limited  studies  have  been  sufficiently  explained  by  the  applicant.    The  applicant  has  also 
justified  the  lack  of  in  vivo  data  for  metabolic  and  drug-drug  interactions  which  provide  sufficient 
reassurance  of  safety  of  regadenoson  for  single  use  as  needed  for  MPI.    Further  reassurance  is 
available  from  pivotal  studies  where  patients  with varied  grades  of  hepatic impairment  were  included 
with sparse sampling.       
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of regadenoson has been detailed adequately in the development programme.  The 
proposed dose of regadenoson (400g, single dose) is adequately justified based on a balance between  
coronary blood flow achieved and poor tolerability at higher doses.

2.4.7.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.7.1. 
 Dose response study(ies) 
The dose response studies consisted mainly of 3 studies - CVT 5111, 5112 and 5121. At doses ≥ 30 μg, 
a  peripheral  iv  bolus  of  regadenoson  caused  increases  in  APV  or  CBF  similar  in  magnitude  to  those 
observed after administration of 18 μg intracoronary adenosine. At doses ≥ 300 μg, APV was sustained  
at ≥ 2 times baseline for at least 2 minutes, and at doses of 400 and 500 μg, APV was sustained at ≥ 
2.5  times  baseline  for  at  least  2  minutes.  At  the  400  μg  dose,  mean  APV  increased  to  ≥  2  times 
baseline by 30 seconds and decreased to less than half of the maximal effect within 10 minutes. The 
400 and 500µg doses were chosen for further study and in the pivotal studies, mainly 400µg was used.   
2.4.7.2. 
 Main studies  
The  Phase  3  studies  CVT  5131  and  CVT  5132  were  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active 
(adenosine)-controlled, multicenter studies of identical design. 
2.4.7.2.1. 
 Methods 
2.4.7.2.1.1.  Study Participants  
Males and females ≥ 18 years of age who were referred for a clinically indicated pharmacologic stress 
SPECT MPI were included in the studies. History of coronary revascularization within 6 months prior to 
enrollment  and  history  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  or  unstable  angina  within  3  months  prior  to 
enrollment  were  the  main  exclusion  criteria.  The  studies  were  conducted  in  North  America,  South 
America and Europe. 
2.4.7.2.1.2.  Treatments 
Patients  randomized  to  the  regadenoson  group  received  a  400  μg  dose  of  Regadenoson  Solution  for 
Injection. Regadenoson (5 mL) was administered as an iv bolus over 10 sec. A matching regadenoson 
placebo  solution  (5  mL)  was  administered  to  patients  randomized  to  receive  active  adenosine  during 
the randomized scan.  
Patients  randomized  to  the  adenosine  group  received  commercially  available  Adenoscan  (3 
mg/mL),manufactured  by  Astellas  Pharma  Inc.  (formerly  Fujisawa  Healthcare,  Inc.,  Deerfield,  IL). 
Adenosine was administered as an iv infusion at a rate of 140 μg/kg/min, over a period of 6 minutes. A 
matching  placebo  solution,  comprised  of  commercially  available  saline,  was  administered  to  patients 
randomized to receive active regadenoson during the randomized scan.  
2.4.7.2.1.3.  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  strength  of  agreement  between  a  regadenoson 
pharmacologic  stress  MPI  scan  and  an  initial  scan  acquired  with  adenosine  was  not  inferior  to  the 
strength  of  agreement  between  two  sequential  pharmacologic  stress  MPI  scans  obtained  with 
adenosine. The agreement rate was based on the evaluations of three blinded and independent readers 
in a blinded read. 
2.4.7.2.1.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  studies  were  presented  to  the  readers  in  random  order,  as  rest  and  stress 
image pairs, and the readers were not told whether the images were from the initial adenosine study, 
the  randomized  adenosine  study,  or  the  randomized  regadenoson  study.    The  expert  readers  did  not 
have  access  to  any  patient  information  other  than  the  paired  rest  and  stress  images.    Each  reader 
scored  the  17  anatomical  segments  on  both  the  rest  and  stress  images  using  a  clinically  accepted  5-
point  semi-quantitative  scale  for  radiotracer  uptake  as  follows:  0  =  normal;  1  =  mildly  reduced  or 
equivocal; 2 = moderately reduced; 3 = severely reduced; or 4 = absent uptake. A particular segment 
was  counted  as  showing  a  reversible  perfusion  defect  if  the  stress  score  was  greater  than  the  rest 
score  and  the  stress  score  was  ≥2  (moderately  reduced).  The  requirement  for  a  perfusion  defect  to 
have  a  stress  score  of  ≥2  was  applied  to  ensure  that  mild  or  equivocal  perfusion  defects  were  not

included  in  the  determination  of  ischemia,  because  these  are  often  due  to  artifact,  tracer 
inhomogeneity, and/or clinically insignificant ischemia. 
2.4.7.2.1.5.  Sample size 
Assuming  that  no  fewer  than  15%  of  the  patients  would  ultimately  be  assigned  to  the  smallest 
randomized  treatment  group,  and  allowing  for  the  exclusion  of  some  patients  from  the  primary 
analysis data set and some variation in the agreement probabilities, a total of 3 x 247 = 741 patients 
was chosen as the initial target for each trial. 
2.4.7.2.1.6.  Randomisation 
There was centrally randomised allocation of patients to two parallel groups of patients for the second 
scan according to a randomisation list.   
Randomisation  to  the  three  categories  of  ischemia  extent  was  monitored  by  the  Core  Imaging 
Laboratory.  Each  study  discontinued  randomization  of  patients  in  the  ‘no  ischemia’  category  before 
study  completion  in  order  to  adhere  to  the  protocol  specified  requirements  to  limit  the  number  of 
patients  in  this  category  to  no  more  than  372  of  the  first  741  patients  randomized.    Once 
randomization had been closed to patients with 0–1 reversible segments, the initial scan was required 
to have at least 2 segments showing reversible defects by the site’s software assessment of the initial 
scan.  In  order  to  avoid  bias  in  the  primary  analysis  of  agreement  of  image  assessment,  a  similar 
exclusion  was  applied  to  the  randomized  scan.  The  order  of  administration  of  adenosine  and 
regadenoson was not randomized.   
2.4.7.2.1.7.  Blinding (masking) 
Neither the investigator nor the patient were told which pharmacologic stress agent was to be used 
during the second stress scan. The pharmacist, however, was not blinded to the randomized stress 
agent. To maintain the blind for the investigator and patient, each patient was to have 2 iv catheters, 
one for the 6-minute infusion of either adenosine or placebo and a second for bolus administration of 
either regadenoson or placebo. 
2.4.7.2.1.8.  Statistical methods 
The  median  count  of  reversible  defects  across  the  3  independent  readers  was  used  as  the  primary 
analysis  variable,  grouped  as  follows:  0–1  (no  ischemia),  2–4  (small  to  moderate  ischemia),  or  ≥  5 
(large ischemia). The primary measure of agreement was the unweighted average rate of agreement 
between  the  initial  and  randomized  scan  images  for  these  three  categories.  In  the  primary  analysis, 
the  average  agreement  rate  was  calculated  for  the  regadenoson  and  adenosine  groups  and  a  95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the difference in agreement rates was computed. Noninferiority was to be 
concluded  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  was  above  −13⅓%.  On  the  condition  that  the  primary 
analysis  demonstrated  non-inferiority,  7  hypotheses  related  to  safety  and  tolerability  of  regadenoson 
relative to adenosine were formally tested in a pre-specified order to control the overall error rate at 5%. 
Each test was performed at the 5% significance level and testing was to stop at the first nonsignificant 
result.

Participants  underwent  an  initial  SPECT  MPI  stress  study  with  adenosine  at  stress  and  also  at  rest.  
Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  have  a  second  SPECT  stress  study  with  either  regadenoson  or 
adenosine  (patients  undergoing  the  one-day  protocol  A  were  added  another  rest  scan).  The  second 
stress scan was acquired no sooner than 1 day and not later than 30 days after the initial stress scan.   
Protocol deviations were noted in 224 (84%) adenosine patients and 427 (83%) regadenoson patients. 
Deviations primarily involved the timing or performance of the safety and tolerability assessments. 
Imaging timing deviations occurred in 19% of adenosine and 23% of regadenoson patients. Deviations 
regarding  caffeine  or  theophylline  levels  occurred  in  12%  of  adenosine  and  14%  of  regadenoson 
patients.  
Following  the  initial  scan,  9%  of  adenosine  and  10%  of  regadenoson  patients  did  not  meet  the 
additional qualifying criteria for the randomized portion of the study.   
2.4.7.2.2.3.  Baseline data 
The  study  patients  were  typical  of  cardiac  patients  referred  for  pharmacologic  stress  MPI,  i.e., 
predominantly male (69%), Caucasian (75%), older (median age of 66 years) and overweight (median 
BMI of 29 kg/m2). A high percentage of patients had significant cardiovascular disease and history.  Of 
the  three  imaging  protocols,  the  two-day  99mTc  protocol  was  the  most  frequently  used  (46% 
adenosine,  44%  regadenoson).  The  median  time  between  the  initial  adenosine  scan  and  the 
randomized scan was 7 days for both stress agent groups. Cardioactive medications taken on the day 
of  randomized  dosing  (prior  to  dosing)  included  beta  blockers  (18%  regadenoson,  16%  adenosine), 
calcium  channel  blockers  (10%  regadenoson,  8%  adenosine)  and  nitrates  (7%  regadenoson,  5% 
adenosine).

Of those not included in the restricted analysis set (RAS), but dosed with blinded study drug (n = 147), 
115 were enrolled after closure to patients with fewer than 2 segments with reversible defects and had 
randomized  studies  showing  0–1  reversible  segments  by  the  site’s  assessment,  and  32  did  not  have 
image data (either because they were not scanned or their scans were not read by the Core Imaging 
Laboratory because of technical issues). The Angiography Analysis Set included 280 patients.

2.4.7.2.2.5.  Outcomes and estimation 
Study CVT 5131 
The overall agreement rates between the initial adenosine scan and the randomized scans were 0.61 
for adenosine and 0.62 for regadenoson, resulting in a difference of 0.01 ± 0.04 (95% CI = −0.075, 
0.092). The lower limit of the confidence interval is above the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 
−0.133. 
• The agreement rates for presence (≥ 2 reversible segments) or absence (0–1 reversible segments) 
of ischemia were 79% for the adenosine group and 80% for the regadenoson group. 
•  In  side-by-side  comparisons  of  the  initial  and  randomized  images,  85%  of  adenosine  patients  and 
83%  of  regadenoson  patients  were  assessed  as  having  the  same  extent  and  severity  of  ischemia  on 
both the initial and randomized scans. 
•  The  software  SSS  category  (0–3,  4–7,  8–11,  ≥  12)  agreement  rates  were  63%  and  60%  for 
adenosine  and  regadenoson,  respectively,  and  the  reader  SSS  category  agreement  rates  were  69% 
and 66% for adenosine and regadenoson, respectively. 
• By overall findings (normal vs abnormal), agreement rates for adenosine and regadenoson were 83% 
and 85%, respectively. 
• The agreement rates with respect to diagnostic category (normal, scar, ischemia, ischemia plus scar) 
were  the  same  for  both  the  adenosine  and  regadenoson  groups  (71%);  when  the  four  diagnostic 
categories were collapsed into two categories of ischemia and no ischemia, the overall agreement rates 
were higher than those for the four diagnostic categories (79% for both groups). 
• Agreement rates were lower in females than males for both regadenoson and adenosine; agreement 
rates were similar between regadenoson and adenosine in both subgroups. 
• Agreement rates were similar in lower BMI (< 30 kg/m2) and higher BMI (< 30 kg/m2) patients; and 
were similar between regadenoson and adenosine in both subgroups. 
• The image quality was considered good to excellent in 93% of the scans in both groups. 
•  The  sensitivity  and  specificity  were  estimated  for  patients  in  the  angiography  subset  comparing 
overall scan finding (normal vs abnormal) to angiography results (normal vs abnormal [either ≥ 70% 
stenosis  or  ≥  50%  stenosis]).  Since  angiography  was  not  required  by  the  protocol,  and  results  were 
obtained  for  only  28%  of  the  efficacy-evaluable  patients,  these  estimates  are  subject  to  substantial 
bias. Using the ≥ 70% stenosis standard, regadenoson had an estimated sensitivity of 86% (125/146) 
and an estimated specificity of 39% (14/36), compared to 82% (69/84) and 50% (7/14), respectively, 
for adenosine. Using the ≥ 50% stenosis standard, regadenoson had an estimated sensitivity of 83% 
(132/159)  and  an  estimated  specificity  of  35%  (8/23),  compared  to  80%  (70/88)  and  40%  (4/10), 
respectively, for adenosine. 
Study CVT 5132 
• The overall agreement rates between the initial adenosine scan and the randomized scans were 0.64 
for adenosine and 0.63 for regadenoson, resulting in a difference of −0.01 ± 0.05 (95% CI = −0.112, 
0.087).  The  lower  limit  of  the  confidence  interval  is  above  the  prespecified  non-inferiority  margin  of 
−0.133. 
• The agreement rates for presence (≥ 2 reversible segments) or absence (0–1 reversible segments) 
of ischemia were the same (76%) for the adenosine and regadenoson groups. 
•  In  side-by-side  comparisons  of  the  initial  and  randomized  images,  78%  of  adenosine  patients  and 
79%  of  regadenoson  patients  were  assessed  as  having  the  same  extent  and  severity  of  ischemia  on 
the initial and randomized scans. 
•  The  software  SSS  category  (0–3,  4–7,  8–11,  ≥  12)  agreement  rates  were  63%  and  62%  for

for adenosine and regadenoson, respectively. 
• By overall findings (normal, abnormal), agreement rates for adenosine and regadenoson were 75% 
and 82%, respectively. 
• The agreement rates with respect to diagnostic category (normal, scar, ischemia, ischemia plus scar) 
were similar for the adenosine and regadenoson groups (66% ado, 68% reg); when the four diagnostic 
categories were collapsed into two categories of ischemia and no ischemia, the overall agreement rates 
were higher than those for the four diagnostic categories (71% ado, 76% reg).

2.4.7.3. 
 Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The two pivotal trials were pooled and the discussion on efficacy has addressed the main issues. .  
2.4.7.4. 
 Clinical studies in special populations 
Special populations in the context of use of regadenoson are those with CAD and these form the main 
population in the pivotal clinical trials. Other special populations such as elderly were already included 
in the pivotal trials.  
Paediatric  studies  were  deferred  in  agreement  with  PDCO.  There  are  no  studies  in  pregnant  women; 
this is appropriate given the risk of radiation exposure with the radiopharmaceutical.  
A  small  study  was  conducted  in  those  with  renal  impairment  (CVT  5112)  and  two  studies  were 
conducted  in  those  with  respiratory  disease  (Asthma  and  COPD).  These  studies  are  discussed  under 
Pharmacology  section.  Furthermore  studies  have  started  in  those  with  varying  grades  of  renal  failure 
(n=450)  and  in  those  with  COPD  (  n=  900).  The  applicant  has  committed  that  the  results  will  be 
submitted  on  completion.  In  addition,  the  applicant  has  provided  a  commitment  to  study 
approximately 100 subjects with hepatic impairment to evaluate potential for unrecognised PD effects 
in a post-marketing observational study.  
2.4.7.5. 
 Supportive studies 
Study CVT 5122 
CVT  5122  was  a  non-randomized,  open-label,  active  (adenosine)  controlled  multicenter  pilot  study  to 
compare  regadenoson  SPECT  MPI  to  adenosine  SPECT  MPI.  The  study  also  assessed  the  safety  and 
tolerability  of  regadenoson  used  conjointly  with  radionuclides  and  was  used  to  select  a  dose  of 
regadenoson  (400  or  500  g)  that  consistently  gave  SPECT  MPI  images  comparable  to  images  from 
adenosine  MPI.  Patients  enrolled  in  CVT  5122  were  to  have  predominantly  ischemic  defects  as 
determined  by  an  initial,  clinically-indicated  adenosine  SPECT  study  (140  g/kg/min,  for  6  min). 
Regadenoson was evaluated in two groups of 18 patients each. The first group of 18 patients received 
a  400  g  dose  of  regadenoson.  The  second  group  received  a  500  g  dose.  For  each  patient,  the 
regadenoson SPECT images were compared to the adenosine SPECT images by a panel of three expert 
readers.  The  images  were  interpreted  in  a  blinded  fashion  by  consensus  and  by  independent 
interpretations by three readers. Consensus reads were used to classify the images based on presence 
of  ischemia  (present,  absent  or  indeterminate).  The  median  of  the  three  independent  reads  was  also 
used  to  calculate  overall  agreement  with  respect  to  presence  or  absence  of  ischemia;  a  category 
assessment  of  none  was  considered  as  no  ischemia,  and  size  categories  of  small,  moderate  or  large 
were considered as presence of ischemia. 
Image assessments were obtained for 18 patients dosed at 400 g and 17 dosed at 500 g.  
Consensus Interpretation: 100% (35/35) of the initial adenosine stress-rest scans showed ischemia; in 
comparison  89%  (16/18)  and  82%  (14/17)  of  the  scans  obtained  with  either  400  g  or  500  g 
regadenoson showed ischemia, respectively.  
Independent  Interpretation:  16  of  the  18  regadenoson  patients  dosed  at  400  g  studies  and  all  18 
adenosine  studies  were  classified  as  showing  ischemia,  yielding  an  agreement  rate  of  16/18  or  89%. 
Although this result is identical to that for the consensus review, the two regadenoson studies assessed 
EMA/455580/2010

as not showing ischemia were not the same in the two analyses. For the patients dosed at 500 g of 
regadenoson,  three  of  the  initial  adenosine  studies  and  three  of  the  regadenoson  studies  were 
categorized  as  not  showing  ischemia.  Thus,  the  adenosine  and  the  regadenoson  marginal  rates  were 
identical (14/17). Whether consensus or median independent ratings were used to classify the studies, 
agreement  rates  between  adenosine  and  regadenoson  at  the  two  doses  studied  did  not  differ 
significantly; however, the study was not powered or designed as a dose comparison study. Patients in 
the 400 g regadenoson group reported fewer adverse events compared to the 500 g group (61% vs 
83%). Thus, the 400 g dose was selected for the Phase 3 program. 
Study CVT 5126 
CVT  5126  was  a  double-blind,  multicenter,  randomized,  controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety  of 
regadenoson  during  pharmacologic  low  level  exercise  stress  testing.  Sixty-two  patients  were  enrolled 
in  this  pilot  safety  study  and  underwent  supine  pharmacologic  stress  testing  using  adenosine.  Sixty 
patients were then randomized to undergo low level treadmill exercise stress testing with the addition 
of  regadenoson  or  matching  placebo.  Previous  studies  have  shown  that  the  addition  of  low  level 
exercise to pharmacologic stress testing improves image quality and detection of ischemia in addition 
to improving patient tolerance. 
The  efficacy  of  regadenoson  was  assessed  through  standardized  collection  of  SPECT  images  and 
blinded, central evaluation of those images by three independent readers. Image quality was assessed 
through comparisons of supine adenosine MPI versus regadenoson with MPI with low level exercise. 
When  combined  with  low  level  exercise,  regadenoson  was  similar  to  adenosine  (supine)  in  detecting 
perfusion  defects.  The  agreement  rate  between  the  two  tests  for  the  presence  (2  or  more  reversible 
segments)  or  absence  of  reversible  defects  was  82%  (kappa  estimate  =  64%).  For  the  39  patients 
assessed, the readers’ findings were: present on both, 19; absent on both, 13; present on adenosine 
supine only, 1; and present on regadenoson plus exercise only, 6. 
In  side-by-side  comparisons  of  images  from  the  adenosine  MPI  to  those  from  regadenoson  plus 
exercise MPI, the extent of reversible perfusion defects was judged less in 5 patients, the same in 25, 
and  greater  in  9.  Images  obtained  with  regadenoson  in  conjunction  with  low  level  exercise  MPI 
appeared  to  be  of  improved  quality  compared  to  those  obtained  with  adenosine-supine  MPI  as 
suggested by improved target-to-background radiotracer uptake ratios, better perceived overall image 
image  quality  with  respect  to 
quality  by  the 
subdiaphragmatic interference as assessed by the independent readers. 
In a side-by-side comparison of overall image quality, images obtained from regadenoson plus exercise 
MPI  were  rated  as  having  similar  (74%)  or  better  (26%)  quality  than  images  from  adenosine-supine 
MPI.  Results  for  image  quality  with  respect  to  subdiaphragmatic  interference  were  similar  to  those 
noted for overall quality.

2.4.7.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Rapiscan  is  an  adjunct  to  a  diagnostic  agent,  which  facilitates  a  diagnostic  test.  The  clinical  program 
consists  of  10  studies  and  the  dose  response  was  evaluated  in  3  studies  as  discussed  before.  There 
was no direct comparison of the utility of the Stress images obtained using 400 and 500µg doses. It is 
understandable  that  a  large  study  with  such  a  design  might  be  unfeasible  for  logistical  reasons.  The 
consensus  and  interdependent  reads  provide  opportunity  for  internal  comparisons.  However, 
consensus reads tend to smooth any differences and the small sample size in this case is a significant 
factor. Notwithstanding all these reasons, the choice of the 400 µg dose is supported.   
The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  in  the  scanning  procedure,  although  useful, 
are  not  essential  for  assessing  efficacy  and  are  not  mandatory  as  they  would  be  for  assessing  the 
efficacy of a diagnostic test. Adenosine is an appropriate reference standard against which to compare 
a pharmaceutical stress agent. The rationale for the demonstration of efficacy is clear: if regadenoson 
agrees with adenosine as often as adenosine agrees with itself, then it may be reasonable to conclude 
that  regadenoson  is  efficacious.  As  the  MPI  and  angiogram  provide  different  but  complementary 
information,  and  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect  all  subjects  to  undergo  an  angiogram,  the  method 
adopted by the applicant of studying a proportion of these as clinically necessary is supported.  
For both pivotal trials the inclusion and exclusion criteria were appropriate with regards to the scanning 
requirements. The decision to exclude patients whose first scan with adenosine was not of good quality 
is  understood  as  a  comparison  cannot  be  made  between  scans.  According  to  the  review  of  the 
demographics,  cardiovascular  history,  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  included  in  the  primary 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 27/43
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy  analysis  shows  that  the  patients  randomized  were  typical  cardiac  patients  who  would  be 
referred for pharmacologic stress MPI. 
The  applicant  has  provided  three  different  weighted  kappa  estimates  for  both  adenosine  and 
regadenoson  as  requested  and  further  analysed  the  weighted  kappa  statistic  in  both  CVT  5131  and 
CVT5132 studies. All analyses show a slightly higher kappa value for regadenoson than adenosine, but 
are  broadly  similar.  All  the  estimated  values  of  the  kappa  statistic  suggest  good  agreement  (greater 
than 0.6). The CHMP concluded that adenosine agrees with itself as often as it does with regadenoson. 
The additional graphical displays provide reassurance that the categorisation of data is not smoothing 
out important differences between the products.  
The applicant has provided adequate and appropriate clarifications for other questions raised including 
the  diagnostic  impact,  patient  management  and  discussion  of  clinical  outcome.  Although  no  formal 
comparison  between  adenosine-regadenoson  and  the  corresponding  adenosine-adenosine  agreement 
estimates is warranted, weighted kappa estimates seem to support the primary finding of adenosine – 
regadenoson  image  comparability  even  if  they  have  neither  been  obtained  in  the  efficacy-evaluable 
analysis  set  population  but  in  the  full  analysis  set  population  –which  suffers  from  major  protocol 
deviations- nor adjusted by all relevant identified factors likely influencing the agreement rate.   
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  non-inferiority  of  regadenoson  with 
adenosine,  the  kappa  statistic  has  been  described  adequately  and  interobserver  variability  has  been 
clarified. 
2.4.7.7. 
 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  of  regadenoson  has  been  established  by  demonstrating  non-inferiority  to  adenosine  in  two 
pivotal trials. 
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
2.4.8.1. 
 Patient exposure 
Clinical data are presented from all 1,651 subjects dosed with regadenoson and includes a comparative 
summary of safety data from regadenoson in the two Phase 3 studies (CVT 5131 and CVT 5132). The 
data  collected  included  changes  in  physical  exams, vital  signs, ECGs,  clinical  laboratory  assessments, 
and  the  collection  of  AE  and  concomitant  medication  information.  ECG  collection,  interpretation  and 
analysis  were  performed  by  Gentiae  Clinical  Research  (San  Bruno,  CA),  using  their  standards  and 
conventions.  The  Core  Lab  determined  the  ECG  intervals  (PR,  QRS,  QT  and  QTcF)  and  rhythm  and 
conduction abnormalities.

In the Phase 3 studies, all patients received open-label adenosine for the initial SPECT MPI, and eligible 
patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  blinded  regadenoson  or  blinded  adenosine  for  the 
randomized SPECT MPI. The dose of blinded adenosine was equivalent to 0.84mg/kg or mean dose of 
68mg  of  adenosine  (range  between  18-126mg).  In  the  Phase  3  studies  (Set  2),  patients  received  a 
400  μg  iv  bolus  of  regadenoson,  followed  immediately  by  a  saline  flush.  Adenosine  was  administered 
as  a  140  μg/kg/min  infusion  over  6  minutes.  All  patients  who  received  randomized  regadenoson  or 
adenosine  also  received  open-label  adenosine  (140  μg/kg/min  over  6  min)  for  an  initial  stress  scan.  
Patients  enrolled  in  the  Phase  3  studies  (Set  2)  were  required  to  be  clinically  indicated  for  a 
pharmacologic  stress  SPECT  MPI  study.  Patients  who  could  not  receive  adenosine  or  were  unlikely  to 
have  a  clinically  stable  condition  were  excluded  from  participation.    In  the  individual  studies,  safety 
assessments  included  collection  of  AEs,  concomitant  medications,  laboratory  assessments,  vital  signs 
(HR and BP), and ECGs. For the integrated safety Set 1 population, only AE data were summarized. For 
Set  2,  AEs,  laboratory  assessments,  vital  signs,  and  ECG  data  were  summarized.  Because  Set  2 
represents the target population, subgroup analyses were performed only for Set 2.  
2.4.8.2.  Adverse events  
Eighty percent (80%) of subjects in Set 1 experienced an AE following regadenoson, with the majority 
(77%) of subjects having AEs considered related to regadenoson. AEs were generally mild (52%) and 
typically  resolved  spontaneously,  with  9%  requiring  treatment.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in 
regadenoson patients were dyspnoea, headache, flushing, chest discomfort, angina pectoris, dizziness, 
and  chest  pain.  The  AEs  with  incidence  >  4%  related  to  study  drug  included:  dyspnoea  (28.7%), 
headache  (25.6%),  flushing  (18.5%),  chest  discomfort  (13.1%),  dizziness  (10.4%),  angina  pectoris 
(7.5%),  nausea  (7.3%),  chest  pain  (6.1%),  feeling  hot  (4.7%),  abdominal  discomfort  (4.5%), 
electrocardiogram  ST  segment  depression  (4.5%),  and  palpitations  (4.4%).  The  AEs  most  frequently 
considered either possibly or probably related to administration of regadenoson were dyspnoea (27% 
regadenoson  vs  25%  adenosine)  and  headache  (25%  regadenoson  vs  16%  adenosine).  The  majority 
of AEs in both treatment groups were considered related to study drug (77% in the regadenoson group 
and 82% in the adenosine group).

Most of the AEs reported for regadenoson patients were of mild severity. The maximum severity of AEs 
was moderate in 21% of  regadenoson patients and in 24% of adenosine patients; and was severe in 
3%  of  regadenoson  patients  and  5%  of  adenosine  patients.  AEs  which  were  severe  and  related  to 
study  drug  occurred  in  2%  of  regadenoson  patients  and  in  4%  of  adenosine  patients.  About  9%  of 
regadenoson patients and 8% of adenosine patients required treatment. The most frequently reported 
(< 1%) severe drug-related events included headache, dyspnoea, chest discomfort, ECG ST segment 
depression, palpitations, tachycardia, and dizziness.  Patients who prematurely withdrew due to an AE 
were the same in Set 2 as in Set 1; 2 patients from CVT 5131 prematurely withdrew after they were 
randomized to receive regadenoson.  
Table 4 Related AE categorized as very common (frequency > 10%) and common (frequency > 1% to 
<10%) (Set 1) 
Specific  AEs of interest  were  headache,  changes  in  BP,  changes  in  heart  rate,  ECG  changes  including 
heart  blocks  and  bronchoconstrictive  effects.  The  main  hemodynamic  effects  are  summarised  in  the 
table below. Decrease of blood pressure was seen overall but not significantly different between groups. 
This decrease was important in some patients (7% of subjects had a decrease > 35mmHg in SBP and 
4% > 25mmHg in DBP). Similar numbers were seen in patients on adenosine (8% and 5% of subjects, 
respectively).  Additional  analysis  of  impact  of  cardioactive  medicine  on  BP  was  provided  in  the 
applicant’s response to CHMP List of Outstanding Issues and it is summarised in the table 5 below.

In  CVT  5131  and  CVT  5132  combined  (regadenoson,  1337  patients  versus  adenosine  678  patients), 
QTcF (Fridericia correction α = 0.33)  changes postdosing were compared  between the adenosine and 
regadenoson  dose  groups.  The  median  increases  from  baseline,  at  4  minutes  after  the  start  of  the 
blinded  infusion  (4  min  after  the  start  of  the  adenosine  infusion  and  1.5  min  after  the  regadenoson 
bolus),  were  6  msec  and  12  msec  for  adenosine  and  regadenoson,  respectively. At  the  time  of  these 
QTcF  increases,  HR  was  increased  by  15  bpm  for  the  adenosine  group  and  by  21  bpm  for  the 
regadenoson  group,  and  mean  QTc  segment  (Fridericia’s  formula)  was  429  msec  in  the  regadenoson 
group (min: 358; max: 549) and 420 in the adenosine group (min: 360; max: 586). The differences 
were more pronounced with the QT corrected with the Bazett’s formula (mean increase from baseline: 
+35  vs  +22;  mean  QT  segment:  regadenoson  457  msec  (min:  374;  max:  610)  and  adenosine  441 
msec (min: 367; max: 624).  
Table 7. Summary of QTc intervals in patients receiving regadenoson and adenosine. 
There were no reported cases of torsade or serious ventricular arrhythmia related to QT /QTc interval 
prolongation in this population, which by itself is at high risk for ventricular arrhythmia with or without 
effect directly in QT.

2.4.8.3. 
 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs  were  reported  for  a  total  of  20/1651  regadenoson  patients  (1%)  in  the  integrated  Set  1 
Population.  The  only  SAE  attributed  to  regadenoson  in  the  clinical  program  (n  =  1,651)  was  the 
exacerbation  of  an  ongoing  migraine  headache.  The  distribution  of  SAEs  was  also  similar  between 
regadenoson  and  comparator.  There  were  5  deaths  reported  in  the  10  studies  of  the  regadenoson 
program with 3 in patients who received randomized study drug. The number of deaths are considered 
to be  small and the temporal relation with the dosing does not  suggest a  direct relation between the 
medicinal product and the deaths. 
2.4.8.4. 
 Laboratory findings 
There  were  small  numbers  of  laboratory  abnormalities  of  clinical  relevance.  Glucose  levels  increased 
between  baseline  and  study  termination  for  both  the  regadenoson  and  adenosine  groups.  Neutrophil 
values tended to increase between baseline and termination, with a larger increase after regadenoson 
than adenosine. 
2.4.8.5. 
 Safety in special populations 
The subgroups of gender and body weight (< 60 vs ≥ 60 kg), and to a lesser degree age, did not show 
clinically  significant  difference.  Overall,  females  experienced  more  AEs  than  males,  had  a  higher 
frequency of ECG abnormalities (ST segment depression and T wave abnormalities), and had a slightly 
greater increase in HR than males. Patients with a body weight of < 60 kg tended to have more AEs 
(including chest pain and chest discomfort) as compared to patients who weighed ≥ 60 kg. The lighter 
weight  patients  also  had  a  higher  frequency  of  ST segment  depression  and  had  a  greater  increase  in 
HR.  However,  observed  differences  in  the  safety  profile  between  categories  of  BMI  and  body  weight 
was not significant. Therefore dose adjustment by weight is not deemed necessary. 
The  data  also  suggest  that  patients  with  impaired  renal  function  could  have  more  AEs  related  to  the 
vasodilator  effect  of  regadenoson.  However,  more  data  on  the  effect  of  renal  impairment  on 
regadenoson PK is needed in order to make definitive conclusions.  
Those with bronchospastic disease did not have significant difference in AEs compared to those without 
airway  obstruction  or  COPD,  notwithstanding  the  changes  in  FEV1  results.  The  surprising  aspect  of 
COPD/Asthma is that in the study 5124 & 5125, those receiving placebo had higher reduction of FEV1 
( >20-30% from baseline). This could either imply that regadenoson demonstrates site specific binding 
tendencies  to  A2A  receptors  or  this  was  due  to  chance.  Drug-drug  interactions  have  not  been 
separately studied as detailed in the pharmacodynamic section earlier in this report. The applicant has 
provided  a  concomitant  medication  analysis  that  does  not  imply  a  significantly  greater  risk  although 
some differences are noted in those with and without vasodilators.  
2.4.8.6. 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  drug-drug  interactions  have  not  been  studied  in  specific  PD  studies.  Patients  who  took  a  beta 
blocker,  calcium  channel  blocker,  ACE  inhibitor,  ARB,  nitrate  or  digoxin  on  the  same  day  as 
regadenoson  dosing  had  a  tendency  to  have  less  pronounced  increases  in  HR  after  receiving 
regadenoson.  Patients taking beta blockers on the day of regadenoson dosing had fewer AEs such as 
angina,  ST  segment  depression,  and  headache  compared  to  those  who  did  not  take  a  beta  blocker. 
Patients taking a calcium channel blocker on the day of dosing had a lower incidence of AEs such as ST 
segment  depression  and  ECG  ischemic  ST  segment  changes.  Table  5  above  summarises  impact  of 
cardioactive concomitant medication on various parameters. 
2.4.8.7. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two subjects discontinued the study due to an AE related to infiltration of the dosing solution. The iv 
solution that infiltrated in both patients was for the delivery of study drug bolus; one after study dose 
and flush was delivered and one during dose delivery.  
2.4.8.8. 
 Post marketing experience 
In  post-marketing  experience,  the  most  frequent  spontaneous  adverse  drug  reports  were  nausea, 
headache,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  dizziness,  and  dyspnoea.  Most  commonly  reported  serious  adverse 
EMA/455580/2010  
Page 32/43
 
  
 
 
 
 
reactions were hypertension, cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, and syncope. There were also two 
reports  of  convulsions,  one  of  TIA  and  one  cerebrovascular  accident.  Overall,  the  reports  are  in  line 
with  the  identified  AEs  during  the  clinical  development  of  the  product  except  for  hypertension, 
convulsion, depressed level of consciousness and TIA that were not observed in the clinical trials.  
During  the  procedure  a  potential  safety  signal  was  detected  in  the  Eudravigilance  database.  Seven 
cases  of  severe  and  serious  cardiac  disorders  revealed  by  severe  respiratory  disorders  in  patients 
receiving  regadenoson  were  submitted  between  October  2009  and  April  2010.  Four  of  these  patients 
experienced  serious  sometimes  severe  cardiac  reactions  (one  case  of  ventricular  fibrillation  and  one 
case of dysrhythmia unspecified, two cases of asystole and three reported instances of cardiac arrest) 
shortly  after  the  administration  of  regadenoson  used  for  myocardial  perfusion  imaging.    At  least  two 
patients  also  experienced  a  severe  hypotension  which  required  the  administration  of  IV  fluids.    In 
addition,  these  patients  experienced  some  serious  respiratory  disorders  which  preceded  the  cardiac 
disorders.  In particular, 6 patients were reported to have experienced a complete respiratory arrest; 
only  one  case  may  suggest  the  occurrence  of  an  acute  anaphylactic  /  anaphylactoid  reaction  (the 
patient  has  a  past  history  of  asthma  and  occurrence  of  a  bronchospasm  has  been  reported).    Two 
patients  probably  experienced  decompensation  of  an  underlying  cardiac  problem  when  receiving 
regadenoson;  other  5  patients  experienced  severe  sometimes  life-threatening  cardiac  disorders 
associated with severe respiratory disorders (incl. respiratory arrest). The outcome was favourable in 
all  cases.  Three  patients  received  a  treatment  with  aminophylline  and  two  patients  received  some  IV 
fluids; the events resolved spontaneously in two cases.   
2.4.8.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  exposure  to  regadenoson  in  the  clinical  development  programme  is  modest  but  adequate  to 
address  the  requirements.  The  post  marketing  exposure  of  nearly  165,000  in  just  over  a  year  in  the 
US is far greater and has not shown any major safety concerns. Nevertheless, it is difficult to conclude 
that  the  clinical  development  programme  would  have  adequately  detected  rare  adverse  events.  The 
main  AE  of  special  interest  or  significance  is  headache  which  was  more  frequent  in  the  regadenoson 
group  in  set-2.  Other  events  of  special  interest  did  not  differ  between  the  two  groups.  The 
regadenoson group had lower drop in SBP,  but more with higher heart rate suggesting that increase in 
HR is not only due to changes in haemodynamics but likely to be an intrinsic effect of regadenoson. All 
parameters  relating  to  vasodilatory  effects  are  lower  in  the  regadenoson  group.  The  main  advantage 
however appears to be its lack of significant bradycardiac effect and reduced AV-blocking ability. The 
regadenoson  or  adenosine  groups  did  not  differ  in  the  rate  of  events.  The  number  of  deaths  is  small 
and the temporal relation with the dosing does not suggest a direct relation between the product and 
deaths,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  some  of  the  subjects  might  have  been  high  risk  while  others 
were at considerably low risk for cardiac events. The distribution of SAEs was also similar and the only 
SAE attributed to regadenoson was migraine. Based on the data presented by the applicant it appears 
that  age  and  gender  influenced  the  rate  of  events,  i.e.,  rates  were  higher  in  older  individuals  and  in 
women.  The  difference  between  genders  was  also  influenced  by  age,  i.e.,  older  women  had  higher 
rates of AEs. Those with bronchospastic disease did not have significant difference in AEs compared to 
those  without  airway  obstruction  or  COPD,  notwithstanding  the  changes  observed  in  FEV1  results  in 
the asthma study.  
The  analysis  of  haemodynamic  effects  suggest  that  regadenoson  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with 
severe  hypotension  although  the  use  of  any  vasodilator  in  those  with  hypotension  is  clinically  not 
indicated. The SPC has been amended and the applicant has updated the list of contraindications in the 
SPC by including severe hypotension and heart failure in section 4.3.  The applicant has reanalysed the 
concomitant  use  of  vasodilatory  cardioactive  medications  and  no  significant  AEs  were  observed  in 
those taking or not taking cardioactive medications. 
Data  from  the  two  pivotal  trials  show  that  regadenoson  has  a  significant  effect  on  QT  prolongation 
compared to adenosine, but the extent of these effects is below what is considered clinically significant 
in  the  guideline  CHMP/ICH/2/04.  The  wide  range  of  QTc  values  in  the  pooled  analysis  raises  some 
concerns with respect to the possible existence of a significant number of outliers, since the maximum 
QTc  prolongation  at  4  minutes  post-dose  was  549  msec  with  the  Fridericia’s  formula  and  624  msec 
with the Bazett’s formula in patients on regadenoson, both of which are above the 500 msec absolute 
QTc  considered  as  clinically  significant.  Overall  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  changes  in  QT  noted  in 
these trials are of limited impact given the pre-clinical data and the results of the QT study.

2.4.8.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  the  issues  relating  to  safety  of  regadenoson  are  not  considered  prohibitive  and  it  can  be 
considered  to  have  a  similar  safety  profile  as  adenosine.  The  advantage  of  regadenoson  is  that  it  is 
administered  as  a  bolus  and  has  a  20  fold  lower  incidence  of  AV  block  in  its  clinical  development 
programme.  While  the  warning  relating  to  this  risk  still  remains  in  the  SPC  and  RMP,  this  lower 
incidence is still considered an advantage over adenosine and thus the safety profile is acceptable.

once in this table to avoid unnecessary duplication 
under other identified risks. Appropriate cross 
references tothis section are included. 
Section 4.2 Posology and Method of 
Administration 
Treatment with Rapiscan is restricted to use in a 
medical facility where cardiac monitoring and 
resuscitation equipment are available. 
Aminophylline may be used to attenuate severe 
and/or persistent adverse reactions to Rapiscan. 
Rapiscan causes a rapid increase in heart rate. 
Patients should remain sitting or lying down and be 
monitored at frequent intervals after the injection 
until ECG parameters, heart rate and blood pressure 
have returned to pre-dose levels. 
Section 4.3 Contraindications 
• Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block or sinus node dysfunction, unless these 
patients have a functioning artificial pacemaker. 
• Unstable angina that has not been stabilised with 
medical therapy. 
• Severe hypotension. 
• Decompensated states of heart failure. 
Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use Rapiscan has the potential to cause serious and 
life threatening reactions, including those listed 
below. Continuous ECG monitoring should be 
performed and vital signs should be monitored at 
frequent intervals until the ECG parameters, heart 
rate and blood pressure have returned to pre dose 
levels. Rapiscan should be used with caution and 
should only be administered in a medical facility 
with cardiac monitoring and resuscitation 
equipment. Aminophylline may be administered in

The SPC includes the following additional 
information which is relevant to minimizing the 
risk of SA/AV nodal block: 
Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use Sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal block: 
Adenosine receptor agonists including regadenoson 
can depress the sinoatrial and AV nodes and may 
cause first, second or third degree AV block, or 
sinus bradycardia. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
Rapiscan may cause ….. SA/AV node block 
leading to first, second or third degree AV block, or

may be used to attenuate severe or persistent 
adverse reactions to Rapiscan 
Cardiac Disorders: 
Common: Atrioventricular block 
Uncommon: Cardiac arrest, Complete AV block, 
Bradycardia Adenosine receptor agonists, including 
Rapiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and 
may cause first-, second- or third degree AV block, 
or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In 
clinical trials first degree AV 
block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 
3% of patients within 2 hours of Rapiscan 
administration; transient second degree AV block 
with one dropped beat was observed in one patient 
receiving Rapiscan. In postmarketing experience, 
third degree heart block and asystole have been 
reported within minutes of Rapiscan administration. 
Information in the SPC which is relevant to 
minimizing the risks of SA/AV nodal block, 
myocardial ischemia and hypotension are presented 
under ‘SA/AV block’ above. 
Additional SPC information which is relevant to 
minimizing the risk of myocardial ischemia is 
presented below. 
Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use 
Myocardial ischaemia: Fatal cardiac arrest, 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and 
myocardial infarction may result from the 
ischaemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents 
like regadenoson. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
Rapiscan may cause myocardial ischaemia 
(potentially associated with fatal cardiac arrest, life-

clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 
35 
mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and 
decreased 
diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was 
observed 
in 4% of patients within 45 minutes of Rapiscan 
administration. The risk of serious hypotension 
may be 
higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, 
hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, 
stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or 
pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery

with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In 
postmarketing 
experience, syncope and transient ischaemic attacks 
have been reported. 
Elderly population: Older patients (≥ 75 years of 
age; 
n = 321) had a similar adverse reaction profile 
compared to younger patients (< 65 years of age; n 
= 
1016), but had a higher incidence of hypotension 
(2% 
versus < 1%). 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Haemodynamic effects: Systolic blood pressure and 
diastolic blood pressure changes were variable, 
with 
the greatest mean change in systolic pressure of −3 
mm Hg and in diastolic pressure of −4 mm Hg 
approximately 1 minute after Rapiscan 
administration.

Section 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use 
machines 
No studies on the effects of Rapiscan on the ability 
to 
drive and use machines have been performed. 
Rapiscan administration may result in adverse 
reactions such as dizziness, headache and dyspnea 
soon after administration. However, most adverse 
reactions are mild and transient, resolving within 30 
minutes after receiving Rapiscan. Therefore, 
Rapiscan 
would be expected to have no or negligible 
influence 
on the ability to drive or operate machinery once 
treatment has been completed and these reactions 
have 
resolved. The physician is advised to provide a 
recommendation for the individual patient 
Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions in most patients receiving 
Rapiscan 
in clinical trials were mild, transient (usually 
resolving 
within 30 minutes after receiving Rapiscan), and 
required no medical intervention. Adverse reactions 
occurred in approximately 80% of patients. The 
most 
common adverse reactions reported during clinical 
development in a total of 1,651 patients/subjects 
were: 
dyspnoea (29%), headache (27%), flushing (23%), 
chest pain (19%), electrocardiogram ST segment 
changes (18%), gastrointestinal discomfort (15%) 
and 
dizziness (11%). 
Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Very common: Dyspnoea 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Respiratory effects: The incidence of 
bronchoconstriction (FEV1 reduction > 15% from 
baseline) after Rapiscan administration was 
assessed 
in two randomised, controlled clinical studies… In 
both studies, dyspnoea was reported as an adverse 
reaction following Rapiscan dosing (61% for 
patients 
with COPD; 34% for patients with asthma) while 
no 
subjects experienced dyspnoea following placebo 
dosing. Dyspnoea did not correlate with a decrease 
in 
FEV1. 
Safety and tolerability testing: In ADVANCE MPI 
1 
and ADVANCE MPI 2, the following pre-specified 
safety and tolerability endpoints comparing 
Rapiscan 
to adenosine achieved statistical significance: (1) a 
summed score of both the presence and severity of 
the 
symptom groups of flushing, chest pain, and 
dyspnoea 
was lower with Rapiscan (0.9 ± 0.03) than with 
adenosine (1.3 ± 0.05)..

completed and these reactions have resolved. The 
physician is advised to provide a recommendation 
for the individual patient. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile Adverse reactions in 
most patients receiving Rapiscan in clinical trials 
were mild, transient (usually resolving within 30 
minutes after receiving Rapiscan), and required no 
medical intervention. Adverse reactions occurred in 
approximately 80% of patients. The most common 
adverse reactions reported during clinical 
development in a total of 1,651 patients/subjects 
were: dyspnoea (29%), headache (27%), flushing

(15%) and dizziness (11%). 
 Nervous system disorders  
Very Common: Headache 
Description of selected adverse reactions: 
Headache was reported by 27% of subjects who 
received Rapiscan in clinical trials. The headache 
was considered severe in 3% of subjects. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties: 
Safety and tolerability testing In ADVANCE MPI 1 
and ADVANCE MPI 2, the following pre-specified 
safety and tolerability endpoints comparing 
Rapiscan to adenosine achieved statistical

(25% vs 16%) was more frequent with Rapiscan. 
SPC information which is relevant to minimizing 
the risk of the interaction with dipyridamole is 
presented below. 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
When possible, dipyridamole should be withheld 
for at least two days prior to Rapiscan 
administration. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction 
Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole increases blood 
adenosine levels and the response to regadenoson 
may be altered when blood adenosine levels are 
increased. When possible, dipyridamole should be 
withheld for at 
least two days prior to Rapiscan administration. 
SPC information which is relevant to minimizing 
the potential risk of bronchoconstriction is

Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use Rapiscan has the potential to cause serious and 
life threatening reactions, including those listed 
below. Rapiscan should be used with caution and 
should only be administered in a medical facility 
with cardiac monitoring and resuscitation 
equipment Aminophylline may be administered in 
doses ranging from 50 mg to 250 mg by slow 
intravenous injection (50 mg to 100 mg over 30-60 
seconds) to attenuate severe and/or persistent 
adverse reactions to Rapiscan. Bronchoconstriction: 
Adenosine receptor agonists may cause 
bronchoconstriction and respiratory 
compromise. For patients with known or suspected 
bronchoconstrictive disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, appropriate 
bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures 
should be available prior to Rapiscan 
administration. 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The A2B and A3 adenosine receptors have been 
implicated in the pathophysiology of 
bronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals (i.e., 
asthmatics). In in vitro studies, regadenoson has 
been shown to have little binding affinity for the 
A2B and A3 adenosine receptors. The incidence of 
bronchoconstriction (FEV1 reduction > 15% from 
baseline) after Rapiscan administration was 
assessed in two randomised, controlled clinical 
studies. In the first study in 49 patients with 
moderate to severe COPD, the rate of 
bronchoconstriction was 12% and 6% following 
Rapiscan and placebo dosing, respectively (p = 
0.31). In the second study in 48 patients with mild 
to moderate asthma who had previously been 
shown to have bronchoconstrictive reactions to 
adenosine monophosphate, the rate of 
bronchoconstriction was the same (4%) following 
both Rapiscan and placebo dosing. In both studies, 
dyspnoea was reported as an adverse reaction 
following Rapiscan dosing (61% for patients with 
COPD; 34% for patients with asthma) while no 
subjects experienced dyspnoea following placebo 
dosing. Dyspnoea did not correlate with a decrease 
in FEV1.

Pregnancy: There are no adequate data from the use 
of regadenoson in pregnant women. Animal studies 
on pre- and post-natal development have not been 
conducted. Foetotoxicity, but not teratogenicity, 
was noted in embryo-fetal development studies. 
The potential risk for humans is unknown.

safety data: Non-clinical data reveal no special 
hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, or embryo-fetal 
development. Signs of maternal and fetal toxicity 
were seen in rats and rabbits (reduced fetal weights, 
delays in ossification [rats], reduced litter size and 
number of live fetuses [rabbits]), but not 
teratogenicity. Fetal toxicity was noted following 
repeated daily administration of regadenoson, but at 
doses sufficiently in excess of the recommended 
human dose. Fertility and pre- and post-natal 
studies have not 
been conducted. 
SPC information which is relevant to the lack of 
safety 
information in lactation is presented below. 
Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether regadenoson 
is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of 
regadenoson in milk has not been studied in 
animals. A decision should be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from 
Rapiscan administration taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman. If Rapiscan is 
administered, the woman should not breast feed for 
at least 10 hours (that is, at least 5 times the plasma 
elimination half life) following 
Rapiscan administration. 
SPC information which is relevant to the lack of 
safety information in patients with renal 
impairment is presented below. 
Section 4.2 Posology and Method of 
Administration 
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is 
necessary. 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Renal impairment: The disposition of regadenoson 
was studied in 18 subjects with various degrees of 
renal function and in 6 healthy subjects. With 
increasing renal impairment, from mild (CLcr 50 to 
< 80 ml/min)to moderate (CLcr 30 to < 50 ml/min) 
to severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min), the 
fraction of regadenoson excreted unchanged in 
urine and the renal clearance decreased, resulting in 
increased elimination half-lives and AUC values 
compared to healthy subjects (CLcr ≥ 80 ml/min). 
However, the maximum observed plasma 
concentrations as well as volumes of distribution 
estimates were similar across the groups. The 
plasma concentration-time profiles were not 
significantly altered in the early stages after 
dosing when most pharmacologic effects are 
observed. No dose adjustment is needed in patients 
with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of 
regadenoson in patients on dialysis has not been 
assessed.

regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the 
urine and factors that decrease clearance do not 
affect the plasma concentration in the early stages 
after dosing when clinically meaningful 
pharmacologic effects are observed. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters of regadenoson have 
not been specifically evaluated in those with 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment. However, 
post hoc analysis of data from the two Phase 3 
clinical trials showed that the pharmacokinetics of 
regadenoson were not affected in a small subset of 
patients with laboratory values suggestive of 
impaired hepatic function (2.5 fold transaminase 
elevation or 1.5 fold elevation of serum bilirubin or 
prothrombin time). No dose adjustment is needed in 
patients with hepatic 
impairment.

bronchoconstriction. 
SPC information which is relevant to the lack of 
safety 
information in patients with prolonged QT 
syndrome is 
presented below 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use Long QT syndrome: Regadenoson stimulates 
sympathetic output and may increase the risk of 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with a long 
QT syndrome. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects 
Cardiac Disorders: 
Common: Other ECG abnormalities including 
electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolonged 
Regadenoson increases sympathetic tone, which 
causes an increase in heart rate and a shortening of 
the QT interval. In a patient with a long QT 
syndrome, sympathetic stimulation can result in 
less shortening of the QT interval than is normal 
and may even cause a paradoxical increase in the 
QT interval. In these patients, the phenomenon of 
R-on-T syndrome can occur, wherein an extra beat 
interrupts the T wave of the previous beat, and this 
increases the risk of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional 
risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

2.6.  Benefit-risk balance  
2.6.1.1. 
 Benefits 
2.6.1.1.1. 
 Beneficial effects 
Regadenoson  is  expected  to  be  used  as  adjunct  to  myocardial  perfusion  imaging  as  a  stress  agent. 
Based  on  its  pharmacological  properties  this  is  appropriate.  Whilst  the  pharmacology  is  similar  to 
adenosine,  it  has  little  activity  against  A1,  A2b  or  A3  receptors  with  significant  specificity  at  the  A2A 
receptor  for  agonistic  effect.    Given  this  background  and  the  data  from  the  pivotal  trials,  its  non-
inferiority  to  adenosine  in  performance  as  a  adjunct  to  radiopharmaceutical  has  been  shown.  One  of 
the  advantages  of  regadenoson  is  fewer  risks:  less  bronchoconstriction  and  less  high  grade  Av  block 
than  with  adenosine.    From  an  administration  perspective  the  main  benefit  of  regadenoson  over 
adenosine would be that it can be administered as a bolus instead of an infusion which would increase 
the convenience for patient and technologist. 
2.6.1.1.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Concerns related to statistical analysis in both pivotal studies have been addressed by the applicant by 
providing  additional  analysis.  Based  on  the  data  provided  on  regadenoson  there  is  little  uncertainty 
about its performance as a stress agent.  
2.6.1.2. 
 Risks 
2.6.1.2.1. 
 Unfavourable effects 
The  risk  of  AV  or  sinus  node  dysfunction  in  predisposed  individuals  still  exists,  although,  it  is  much 
lower  for  regadenoson  than  for  adenosine.  The  major  AEs  reported  are  dyspnoea  and  headache  and 
these  have  been  addressed  in  the  SPC.  Bronchospastic  tendency  appears  lower  with  regadenoson; 
reduction in FEV1 was still observed. However, this could not be quantified due to the small size of the 
studies 
2.6.1.2.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Based on the data provided, there are a few uncertainties regarding safety of regadenoson 
in  patients  with  renal  failure  and  in  patients  with  COPD.  The  data  currently  available  are 
from  small  studies.  Post  marketing  studies  are  ongoing  for  further  evaluation  of  risk  in  renally 
impaired  subjects  and  in  those  with  COPD  (chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease).  The  magnitude 
of effect will be better judged with increasing exposure as data become available from these 
studies. The applicant has committed to submit the study reports as follow up measures. 
2.6.1.3. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the data, there are no safety issues; missing information will be addressed by post marketing 
studies. Non-inferiority to adenosine has been shown in two pivotal trials. Clarifications regarding 
diagnostic value and the statistic used (kappa) for demonstrating non-inferiority have been adequately 
addressed by the applicant and overall safety reports including the EU-RMP and Pharmacovigilance 
systems have been updated. The benefit-risk balance is favourable for regadenoson.  
2.6.1.4. 
 Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
As non-inferiority to adenosine has been shown, it is concluded that regadenoson performs as well as 
adenosine  as  an  adjunct  to  the  radiopharmaceutical  for  detection  of  stress  induced  ischaemia.  Its 
safety  profile  is  acceptable  despite  a  number  of  uncertainties,  which  will  be  further  explored  in  post 
marketing  studies.  The  benefit  risk  balance  is  considered  positive  for  the  indication  “Rapiscan  is  a 
selective  coronary  vasodilator  for  use  as  a  pharmacological  stress  agent  for  radionuclide  myocardial 
perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress. 
” and the CHMP recommends approval as standard marketing authorisation.

2.6.1.5. 
 Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
  Additional pharmacovigilance planning was requested to adequately monitor the safety of the 
product. 
  No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.7.  Recommendation 
2.7.1.1. 
 Normal opinion 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Rapiscan in the in the following indication: 
“Rapiscan is a selective coronary vasodilator for use as a pharmacological stress agent for radionuclide 
myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress” 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation .

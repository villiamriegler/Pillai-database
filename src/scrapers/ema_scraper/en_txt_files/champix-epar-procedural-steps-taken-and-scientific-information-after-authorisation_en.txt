The conducted Study A3051123 showed that varenicline 
had efficacy both in smokers with or without a prior history 
of psychiatric disorder.  
The adverse events profile of varenicline in A3051123 
corresponded with the varenicline known safety profile. 
Varenicline was not associated with a greater risk of 
suicide-related events, or with a greater risk of other 
clinically significant neuropsychiatric events, compared to 
placebo or to bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy. 
This was the case in smokers with or without a prior history 
of psychiatric disorder.

A3051075, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline compared to 
placebo for smoking cessation through reduction, which 
enrolled smokers who were not able or willing to quit 
abruptly. Subjects gradually reduced the number of 
cigarettes smoked over a 12-week treatment period prior 
to quitting and to continue with another 12 weeks of 
treatment.  
The study demonstrated that a gradual quit approach, with 
a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked prior to 
quitting has efficacy for smokers who will not or cannot quit

would not be expected using this approach, and the study

analyses, pooling data regarding risk of suicide and/or 
psychiatric symptoms from 5 randomized, placebo 
controlled studies of varenicline, rating study subjects with 
the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, as well as data 
reported from the total of 18 randomized, placebo 
controlled varenicline studies.  
These analyses do not show statistically significant 
differences between varenicline and placebo in the 
incidence rates of suicidal ideation or behaviour, in the 
incidence rate of hostility/aggression, or in the incidence 
rates of various psychiatric symptoms/disorders with the 
exception of sleep related symptoms. There were no clinical 
results reported from the studies that give rise to concern. 
The results from study A3051122, a study of stable 
patients with depressive disorder where special emphasis 
was placed on retrieving information about the incidence of 
hostility/aggression, suggest that hostility and increased 
aggression is perhaps more common in subjects treated for 
smoking tobacco/nicotine dependence than has previously 
been reported. In study A3051122 the incidence of these 
Page 10/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms was higher in the varenicline-treated group, but 
it is plausible that this may in part be a result of 
varenicline-treated subjects reducing their tobacco/nicotine 
consumption. Moreover, as stated above, the overall meta-
analysis of hostility/aggression does not show an increased 
risk associated with varenicline compared with placebo. 
The MAH’s obligation to conduct the post-authorisation 
measure was fulfilled, without new concerns about 
suicidality or psychiatric events arising. The results do not 
change the positive benefit-risk balance of varenicline. The 
corresponding obligation was deleted from Annex II.

previously been studied in full-scale clinical trials. Study 
A3051139 was designed to compare the efficacy and safety 
of re-treatment with varenicline with placebo in subjects 
who had previously taken varenicline and had been unable 
to stop smoking or who had relapsed. 
This study provided evidence that re-treatment with 
varenicline can benefit smokers who either failed to quit 
while taking varenicline or relapsed after taking it. Re-
treatment with varenicline was generally well-tolerated, 
with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of 
varenicline-naïve subjects and did not reveal any new 
safety concerns. 
The following text was added to section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“Patients who are motivated to quit and who did not 
succeed in stopping smoking during prior Champix therapy, 
or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another 
quit attempt with Champix”.

effects in controlled varenicline clinical studies. The CHMP 
supported that the analysis should be mentioned in the 
SmPC, with a description including its main results and 
mentioning the fact that the increase in risk observed with 
Champix was higher in patients with higher cardiovascular 
risk than in patients with lower cardiovascular risk. The 
SmPC now details the results of the analysis. The CHMP 
considered that the data assessed on the cardiovascular 
effects do not change the benefit-risk balance for Champix 
in smoking cessation in adults and that the revised wording 
of the product information adequately reflects the main 
findings of the CV meta-analysis. 
Section 2 of the Package Leaflet: Information for the User, 
Take care with CHAMPIX, was amended to reflect changes 
made to section 4.4 and section 5.1 of the SmPC, and now

Following this request, the MAH conducted a safety study of 
Champix (varenicline) for smoking cessation in patients 
with psychosis (Study A3051072). After finalization of 
Study A3051072, its results were evaluated as part of FUM 
008.2. This assessment led to a request for clarification to 
the MAH, who, within their variation application for this 
procedure (II/36), provided answers to the points raised by 
the CHMP and at the same time submitted wording to 
update the SPC for Champix in accordance to the findings 
emerging from Study A3051072. 
The key messages added to the SPC were that “Limited 
data are available from a single smoking cessation study in

In July 2011, the results of a large pooled data study 
(Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use, Section 4.8 Undesirable effects, Section 5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SPC) and Section 2 (Before 
you take Champix) and 4 of the Package Leaflet) 
with information regarding cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events. 
(meta-analysis) of Champix's side effects affecting the 
heart and blood vessels were published in the literature. 
The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association 
Journal on Monday 4 July, looked at the number of 
cardiovascular events seen in a total of 8,216 people taking 
either Champix or placebo in 14 randomised clinical trials 
lasting up to a year. The events included heart attack, 
stroke, disruption of the heart rhythm, heart failure and 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
death related to cardiovascular problems. The largest of the 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
studies included over 700 patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. 
The meta-analysis found that events were rare in both 
groups, but that there was a slightly increased number in 
the people taking Champix: 1.06% of those taking Champix 
had an event (52 out of 4,908) compared with 0.82% of 
those taking placebo (27 out of 3,308). This did not result 
in a difference in death rates between the two groups. The 
Committee identified a number of limitations of the meta-
analysis, including the low number of events seen, the 
types of events counted, the higher drop-out rates in 
people receiving placebo, the lack of information on the 
timing of events, and the exclusion of studies in which no-
one had an event. Because of these limitations, the 
Committee could not draw robust conclusions from the 
Page 19/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meta-analysis. 
However, as recommended by the CHMP, Pfizer, the 
marketing-authorisation holder for Champix, included more 
information on cardiovascular events in the medicine's 
product information, as follows: 
- Appropriate warnings on risk of cardiovascular events 
were introduced in section 4.4 (Special warnings and 
precautions for use). 
- In Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SmPC 
cardiovascular events were previously presented in three 
different subsections.  In order to improve clarity, the 
events "blood pressure increased, electrocardiogram ST 
segment depression, electrocardiogram T wave amplitude 
decreased, heart rate increased” were moved to the 
appropriate subsections.  Furthermore, “stroke” was 
included in the section. 
- The description in the SmPC (section 5.1) on the study in 
over 700 subjects with cardiovascular disease has been 
made more informative in terms of cardiovascular safety.  
The text has been made more factual by including 
information on how many subjects experienced 
cardiovascular events in general and specific events such 
as myocardial infarction in each treatment group.

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considered that the benefit-risk balance of Champix 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to 
be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
A number of safety issues have been identified for 
Champix, in particular neuropsychiatric changes (most 
notably depression, suicide-related events and aggressive 
behaviour) but also cardiovascular events. Given the 
serious nature of the above issues, their impact on the 
benefit-risk balance needs to be continuously evaluated. 
Thus, the CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to 
submit yearly PSURs until otherwise stated. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Champix, which 
requires submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded

In clinical study A3051095, the efficacy and safety of 
Champix was evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility 
of quitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. The 
results of the study suggested that the flexible target quit 
date between week 2-5 may be an alternative option for 
those patients who are not willing or able to quit early in 
the treatment. 
Accordingly, the product information for Champix has been

Application for Champix included only 'healthy' smokers. 
The MAH has conducted a post-marketing study in a 
population with mild to moderate chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), as this subpopulation has a 
pronounced need for smoking cessation. The study showed 
that varenicline is as efficacious and well-tolerated in the 
treatment of patients with COPD than among healthy 
smokers.  
Therefore, the MAH was requested to update the Product 
Information for Champix as, since smoking cessation is 
especially relevant in this population, it may be helpful for 
clinicians to be aware that varenicline could be used in 
patients with mild-moderate COPD. The following text has 
been added to section 5.1 of the SPC for Champix: 
"The efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for 
smoking cessation in subjects with mild-moderate COPD 
was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo- 
controlled clinical trial.  
In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment 
for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week non-treatment follow-
up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-
confirmed; 4-week Continuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from 
week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was 
the Continuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through

place at the May 2008 PhVWP and CHMP meetings, a 
review of spontaneous reporting data on Suicide-Related 
Events (SRE) was presented and discussed. As a result of 
the discussion on SRE, the CHMP considered that updates 
to section 4.4 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were 
required to strengthen the existing warnings with regards 
to SRE.  
In particular, mention of the fact that not all patients 
experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts had a 
previous history of psychiatric illness or had stopped 
smoking was added to the SPC. Moreover, instructions on 
stopping Champix and contacting doctors when patients 
develop agitation, depressed mood, changes in behaviour 
or suicidal thoughts were added to the Product Information.

Further to the submission of the second Periodic Safety 
Products Characteristics (SPC) to include information 
on depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is being updated 
accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Assessment Report (PSUR) and additional data provided by 
the MAH, the CHMP reviewed reported cases of suicidal 
ideation (thinking about committing suicide) or attempted 
suicide in patients taking Champix. From the available data, 
and considering that stopping smoking itself can make 
people depressed, the CHMP could not definitely conclude 
on the actual association of the reported cases with 
Champix. However, the CHMP agreed that the Product 
Information should be updated to include information in 
this regard.  
The following warning was included in section 4.4 
(Warnings and Precautions) of the SPC: "Depressed mood 
may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal. Depression, 
rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, has 
been reported in patients undergoing a smoking cessation 
attempt. These symptoms have also been reported while 
attempting to quit smoking with Champix. Clinicians should 
be aware of the possible emergence of significant 
depressive symptomatology in patients undergoing a 
smoking cessation attempt, and should advise patients

accordingly." 
Section 4.8 (Side Effects) of the SPC was also updated to 
include that "Post-marketing cases of depression and 
suicidal ideation have been reported in patients taking 
varenicline".  
The PL was updated accordingly.

psychiatric conditions in connection to smoking cessation, 
as previously requested by the CHMP. In addition to this 
requested change, the MAH included further changes to the 
leaflet in their application. Specifically, a sentence with 
clarifications regarding smoking after the 'quit date' was 
added to section 1 ("What is Champix and what it is used 
for"). Finally, administrative changes to the details of the

based on current epidemiological knowledge and most 
cases had coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. However, 
the presence of cardiovascular risk factors does not exclude 
an additional contributory risk from the use of varenicline. 
Therefore, the following information was added to section 
4.8 of the SPC: "Post-marketing cases of myocardial 
infarction have been reported in patients taking 
varenicline.".

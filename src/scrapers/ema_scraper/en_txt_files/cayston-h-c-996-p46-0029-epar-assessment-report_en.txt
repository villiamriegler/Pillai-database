1.  Recommendation 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, the Rapporteur considers that the article 46 
paediatric data (EMEA/H/C/000996/art 46 evaluating the efficacy and safety of aztreonam lysine in the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) (paediatric and adult) patients infected with Burkholderia spp. did not 
contribute to new safety/efficacy information. Moreover Cayston 75 mg is not indicated for use in the 
treatment of Burkholderia-infection in CF patients, hence this study has no added value for te 
approved indication.  
No clinical benefit could be observed in paediatric patients, and no new safety information other than 
already stated in the SmPC was observed. The Rapporteur is of the opinion that the data do not 
warrant any changes to the SmPC. The benefit-risk for Cayston 75 mg in the approved indication 
remains positive. 
2.  Introduction 
2.1  Type of application and aspects on development 
The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006. This study is not part of an agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The MAH submitted one 2-part study (GS-US-0205-0127) which is a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks of aztreonam lysine (AZLI) in patients with Burkholderia species 
infection (part 1), followed by an open label study (part 2) for 24 weeks. This study included 100 cystic 
fibrosis (CF) patients with Burkholderia infection of which only 17 were paediatric patients (6 AZLI 
treated, and 11 placebo). 
The MAH did not propose any SmPC changes. 
Cayston 75 mg (aztreonam lysine [AZLI]) is presently not approved for treatment of Burkholderia 
infection in CF patients.  
2.2  About the product 
The CHMP issued a final positive Opinion for granting a conditional MA to Cayston on 21 September 
2009. The conditional marketing authorisation was renewed on 26 August 2010. On 5 September 2011 
the conditional marketing authorisation was lifted in a marketing authorisation not subject to specific 
obligations. The MAH filled a variation to expand the currently approved indication (see below) for 
Cayston 75 mg with paediatric patients aged 6 and older. Approval of the variation is pending (see 
Final variation assessment report dated 13 April 2012). 
Currently approved indication(s) 
Cayston is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older.

Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Posology 
Patients should use a bronchodilator before each dose of Cayston.  Short acting bronchodilators can be 
taken between 15 minutes and 4 hours and long acting bronchodilators can be taken between 
30 minutes and 12 hours prior to each dose of Cayston. 
For patients taking multiple inhaled therapies, the recommended order of administration is as follows: 
bronchodilator 
mucolytics 
and lastly, Cayston. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Adults 
The recommended dose for adults is 75 mg three times per 24 hours for 28 days. 
Doses should be taken at least 4 hours apart. 
Cayston may be taken in repeated cycles of 28 days on therapy followed by 28 days off Cayston 
therapy. 
Paediatric population 
Cayston is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to insufficient data on 
safety and efficacy (see section 5.1). 
2.3 
Burkholderia infection in CF patients 
Cystic fibrosis is characterized by progressive, obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic 
airway infection. Common infectious organisms in patients with CF include Staphylococcus aureus, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Burkholderia spp., Achromobacter spp., and Stenotrophomonas 
maltophilia. Acquisition of specific pathogens, including PA and Burkholderia spp., can significantly 
alter the clinical course of the patient with CF (Courtney, 2004; Treggiari, 2007). Infected patients 
experience progressive obstruction of the airways and loss of lung function that is due in large part to 
the inflammatory response to chronic bacterial infection. Loss of pulmonary function is the primary 
cause of death in patients with CF (Cystic Fibrosis foundation, 2006; anonymous, 2007). 
Although PA is the best characterized bacterial pathogen associated with CF pulmonary disease 
(Gibson, 2003; Davis, 1996; Pamukcu, 1995), Burkholderia spp. are recognized as causing significant 
change in the clinical course of patients with CF. The prevalence of infection with Burkholderia was 3% 
in 2007 (Cystic fibrosis foundation, 2010) with significant treatment centre and regional differences. 
Chronic airway infection with PA occurs in more than 69% of European CF patients by age 20. 
Approximately 50% of CF patients with Burkholderia have co-infection with PA.  
Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with (Isles, 1984; Goss, 2004; Thomassen, 1985) 
Burkholderia spp., and epidemic strains are recognized that are more virulent. The most virulent 
strains are associated with ~40% loss of FEV1 per year or a 2 year mortality rate of > 50%. Morbidity 
associated with Burkholderia spp. infection includes more days of feeling poorly, more frequent and 
difficult-to-treat exacerbations, significant weight loss, and accelerated loss of lung function.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

There are no evidence-based effective antibiotic therapies available for the management of chronic 
Burkholderia spp. infection in CF patients, and these patients historically have been excluded from 
clinical trials of inhaled antibiotics. Patients typically receive a combination of systemic, oral, and/or 
inhaled antibiotics frequently or even continuously for control of their symptoms. Eradication of 
Burkholderia from the CF lung has not been successful (Waters, 2012) and antibiotic treatment is 
mainly suppressive.  
Since patients with Burkholderia infection frequently have rapid life-threatening loss of lung function, 
they are often considered for lung transplantation. However, Burkholderia infection is associated with 
worse outcomes, and many transplant centres exclude or limit transplantation in these patients 
(Murray, 2008).  
Burkholderia spp., gram negative bacteria, are usually susceptible to aztreonam (Kucher’s handbook). 
Eucast only has 22 observations and MICs to aztreonam vary between 0.25 and 256 µg/ml. No cut off 
values have been validated. Based on this it is expected that AZLI is active against Burkholderia.  
3.  Scientific Discussion 
In accordance with the pediatric article 46 regulation, the MAH submitted one final efficacy and safety 
study in CF patients infected with Burkholderia, aged 6 years and older, treated continuously for up to 
12 months with Cayston 75 mg (Study GS-US-205-0127). Part 1 of the study (randomized phase) 
consisted of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled treatment for 24 weeks, and Part 2 
(extension phase) consisted of open-label AZLI treatment for 24 weeks. All subjects received standard 
of care, including non-study antibiotics, as determined by the treating physician while participating in 
the study. Safety and efficacy were analysed through Week 24 for the randomized phase of the study 
and through Week 48 for the extension phase.  
Of the 100 patients enrolled, only 17 were paediatric patients (6 patients aged 6 to 12 years and 11 
patients aged 13 to 17 years). In each paediatric patients group only 3 patients (6 in total) were 
treated with AZLI. Based on these small patient numbers no conclusions can be drawn.  
3.1 
Efficacy results in paediatric patients 
The MAH only presented paediatric subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint FEV1 % predicted in 
both randomised and extension phase. No significant clinical effect was observed for the primary 
endpoint in either paediatric subgroup (table 1 and 2). In the randomised phase the difference in least-
squares mean (LSM) between AZLI versus placebo in patients ≥ 6 to ≤12 years was 5.17 (-25.08, 
25.43) [p=0.624] and in patients >12 to <18 years 19.61 (-1.27, 40.48) [p=0.062]. Adjusted mean 
(SE) AUCave of relative change from extension phase baseline in FEV1 % predicted at the end of the 
extension phase for subjects aged ≥ 6 to ≤ 12 years was  4.51 (4.13) for AZLI/AZLI-treated subjects 
and -3.01 (4.13) for placebo/AZLI-treated subjects. For subjects aged > 12 to < 18 years, the change 
from extension phase baseline in AUCave of relative change in FEV1 % predicted was  7.49 (8.83) for 
AZLI/AZLI-treated subjects and 1.50 (5.28) for placebo/AZLI-treated subjects at the end of the 
extension phase. 
Data regarding secondary endpoints (use of systemic  antibiotics, time to systemic or inhaled 
antibiotics for respiratory events and total number of hospitalizations, and AUCava CFQ-RSS) were all

based on the overall population (n=100).  No significant differences were observed in the overall 
population. However, there were some observations of e.g. less required antibiotics use in respiratory 
events, and the time to use of inhaled or i.v. antibiotics in the AZLI group seemed to be delayed.  
Numbers are too small to allow any conclusion.

LSMeans and CIs were calculated based on an ANCOVA model with baseline value as a covariate. 
AUC ave was the calculated area under the curve corrected for extension phase baseline (Week 24) and adjusted by 
the number of days on study from Week 24 through Week 48. 
All subjects received AZLI during the extension period. 
3.2  Microbiology results 
Burkholderia spp. in sputum 
No separate data with respect to the paediatric patients was presented by the MAH. Interpretation of 
the individual paediatric data is difficult as in most cases there is no quantitative data on the CFU/g 
sputum on Burkholderia available other than “present”. In the exceptional case where exact data is 
presented, it is noticed that reduction of Burkholderia spp. CFU/g sputum is intermittently. 
From the overall population data on a small number of subjects in the AZLI treatment group (15 
subjects [31%]) and placebo treatment group (20 subjects [38%]) was presented. In the randomized 
phase the average adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline in log10 Burkholderia spp. CFU/g sputum 
at Week 24 was not significantly different between patients treated with AZLI (1.41 [0.58]) and 
patients treated with placebo (0.48 [0.50]) (treatment difference: 0.93, p-value: 0.232). However, an 
increase was observed among AZLI-treated patients across the 6 months of treatment.  
In week 48 (extension phase)  the log10 Burkholderia spp. CFU/g sputum returned to baseline values in 
the AZLI/AZLI treated patients (adjusted mean 0.04 (SE 0.78). However as the observation is only 
based on 13 patients no conclusion is allowed.  
Overall, it can be concluded that Burkholderia is not eradicated from the paediatric patients. In the 
overall population Burkholderia disappeared equally in the AZLI and placebo treated patients. This lack 
of eradication might result in aztreonam-resistant isolates after partly suppressive therapy.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/310179/2013  
Page 8/10 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore it can be questioned whether the used dosage of 75 mg AZLI TID was well chosen. The 
MAH did not perform a pharmacokinetic study performed in Burkholderia infected CF patients. As these 
patients have a worse clinical picture, e.g. fast declining lung function, it is uncertain whether AZLI 
concentrations reached effective levels within these patients. 
MIC-values 
All paediatric patients were infected with different Burkholderia species. (B. cenocepacia (4/17) and B. 
multivorans (10/17)).  Although the MAH did not present the paediatric data separately, it was noticed 
that in the individual paediatric patient data MIC values increased 2 to 4-fold from baseline to week 24. 
In the overall study population the same trend is shown. In the AZLI group MIC50 for Burkholderia 
increased 2-fold (from 1024 µg/ml at baseline to 2048 µg/ml at week 24) and MIC90 increased 4-fold 
(from 512 µg/ml at baseline to 2048 µg/ml at week 24). In the extension phase a 2-fold reduction was 
observed in the AZLI/AZLI group for both MIC’s. In the placebo/AZLI group both MIC’s remained 
unchanged over the treatment course (48 weeks), being 128 and 1024 µg/ml respectively. This 
indicates that Burkholderia’s susceptibility to aztreonam persistently decreased over time (48 weeks).  
3.3 
Safety results 
Based on the submitted data no new safety information which is not already stated in the SmPC for 
Cayston was identified. No pediatric deaths occurred during the overall study.  
4.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
The MAH submitted an efficacy and safety study in CF patients infected with Burkholderia spp, aged 6 
years and older (GS-US-205-0127) in accordance to the article 46 regulation. Cayston 75 mg 
(aztreonam lysine [AZLI]) is presently not indicated for the treatment of Burkholderia in CF patients. 
The study only included 17 paediatric patients from a total of 100 patients. Of these 17 patients only 6 
were treated with AZLI. Due to this small numbers no firm conclusions with regard to the paediatric 
population can be drawn. 
Overall, Burkholderia is not eradicated in AZLI treated patients, and MIC-values are increasing over 
time indicating that Burkholderia resistance to AZLI is a potential risk with long term treatment. One 
can not exclude that this is due to inadequate dosing. There is no pharmacokinetic study in 
Burkholderia infected CF patients. It is thus uncertain whether AZLI concentrations reached effective 
levels within these patients. 
No new safety information has become available from the present submitted study. All reported side 
effects are already listed in the SmPC.  
Hence the Rapporteur is of the opinion that the data do not warrant or support any SmPC changes. 
The benefit-risk for the current approved indication remains positive.

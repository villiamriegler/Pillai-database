2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  application  is  a  centralised  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  made  by  H.  Lundbeck  A/S 
for  Selincro  18  mg  film-coated  tablets  (as  21.917  mg  nalmefene  hydrochloride  dihydrate, 
corresponding to 20 mg nalmefene hydrochloride and 18.06 nalmefene as base) to be taken as-needed 
for the reduction of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence (AD). 
Acute  alcohol  intake  results  in  mesolimbic  dopamine  release  (facilitated  by  the  release  of  β-
endorphins),  which  can  provide  positive  reinforcement.  However,  after  repeated  exposure  to  high 
doses of alcohol, neuroadaptations occur in several neurotransmitter/ neuropeptide systems, including 
the opioid receptor system, which drives continued alcohol intake. 
Nalmefene  is  an  opioid  system  modulator  with  a  distinct  μ,  δ,  and  κ  receptor  profile.  In  vitro  studies 
show  that  nalmefene  is  a  selective  opioid  receptor  ligand  with  antagonist  activity  at  the  μ  and  δ 
receptors  and  partial  agonist  activity  at  the  κ  receptor.  In  vivo  studies  have  demonstrated  that 
nalmefene  reduces  alcohol  consumption,  possibly  by  modulating  cortico-mesolimbic  functions,  thus 
reducing the reinforcing effects of alcohol.   
On 30 May 2008, Lundbeck obtained EMA Scientific Advice on the clinical development programme for 
nalmefene and the design of the clinical studies that constitute the pivotal studies of this MAA.  
On 18 February 2010, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted the EMA 
Guideline  on  alcohol  dependence,  which  came  into  effect  1  September  2010.  According  to  this 
guideline, the goals of alcohol dependence treatment include the achievement of abstinence, reduction 
in  frequency  and  severity  of  relapse,  and  improvement  in  health  and  psychosocial  functioning.  The 
main  focus  of  this  guideline  is  therefore  on  products  that  are  developed  as  an  aid  to  achieve  and 
maintain abstinence as the ultimate treatment goal  in patients with alcohol dependence. This includes 
products  to  prevent  relapses  after  initiated  abstinence,  as  well  as  products  leading  to  clinically 
significantly  reduced  alcohol  consumption  as  an  intermediate  goal  (harm  reduction  approach)  on  the 
way to full abstinence.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 7/73 
 
 
 
 
 
For the intermediate harm reduction goal (significant moderation without prior detoxification) efficacy 
should be expressed by change to baseline in total consumption of alcohol (TAC, per month, presented 
as amount of pure alcohol in grams per day) as well as by reduction in number of Heavy Drinking Days 
(HDD  defined  as  more  than  60  grams  of  pure  alcohol  in  men  and  40  grams  in  women).  Both  are 
considered primary variables.  
Reduction of alcohol consumption as a clinical significant treatment goal is widely accepted in current 
literature reports (White Paper, jointly released by  Wim van den Brink, University of Amsterdam, NL, 
Antoni Gual, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, ES and Karl Mann, University of Heidelberg, DE). 
Medicines that are currently approved in many countries for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence 
are  disulfiram,  acamprosate  and  naltrexone.  All  three  are  only  recommended  as  adjunctive  to 
psychosocial counselling in motivated patients. In the pivotal trials supporting this MAA, nalmefene was 
also administered in conjunction with regular psychological motivation-enhancing interventions. 
The concept of applying opioid receptor antagonists to interfere with the mesolimbic rewarding system, 
counteracting the positive reinforcement effects in alcohol dependence is not new and has been widely 
described  in  literature  reviews.  Another  competitive  µ-opioid  receptor  antagonist,  naltrexone,  was 
already licensed in several European countries as a pharmacological treatment approach, adjunct to an 
encompassing  psychosocial  treatment  concept,  in  an  effort  to  maintain  abstinence  and  to  prevent 
relapse.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: “reduction of alcohol consumption in patients with 
alcohol dependence”. 
The final indication recommended by the CHMP as most accurately reflecting the pivotal trial data and 
specifying the most appropriate target population and prescribing conditions for nalmefene treatment, 
was as follows:  
Selincro is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence 
who have a high drinking risk level (see section 5.1), without physical withdrawal symptoms and who 
do not require immediate detoxification. 
Selincro should only be prescribed in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focussed on 
treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption. 
Selincro should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high drinking risk level two weeks 
after initial assessment. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 8/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nalmefene hydrochloride dihydrate is very soluble in water and is not hygroscopic. 
Nalmefene hydrochloride dihydrate is a chiral compound, containing 4 asymmetric carbon atoms. 
Only one crystal form of Nalmefene hydrochloride dihydrate has been identified. Nalmefene 
hydrochloride dihydrate does not melt, but becomes amorphous after dehydration. 
The structure of nalmefene hydrochloride dihydrate was demonstrated by elemental analysis, IR, 
UV/Vis, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy as well as MS spectrometry. Its crystal structure was 
analysed by X-ray diffraction and specific optical rotation was determined. It has been shown that no 
polymorphic forms were observed.  
Manufacture 
The active substance is sourced from two active substance manufacturers.  
Nalmefene hydrochloride dihydrate is manufactured synthetically. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed  information  on  the  manufacturing  of  the  active  substance  has  been  provided  and  it  was 
considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identification (FT-IR, HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals, and particle size.  
Batch analysis data were provided for several batches, including commercial scale batches, produced 
with the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be 
manufactured reproducibly. 
All compendial and in-house test methods are adequately validated.  
Stability 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  PE  bags  as  primary  and  in  HDPE  drums  as  secondary  packing 
material.  
Batches of active substance (commercial scale, included) packed in the intended commercial package 
from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(25°C/60%RH) for up to 36 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 months. Satisfactory 
results on stress conditions (e.g. photostability, acid, hydrolysis and oxidation) were also provided. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 9/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  identification,  water  content,  related  substances 
and assay. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  3  years  in  the  proposed 
container closure system in order to protect from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The development of the formulation has been well described and the manufacturing process justified. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
There are no overages used in the manufacturing process. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
A standard manufacturing process is used to manufacture the film-coated immediate release tablets. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing process and has been demonstrated to be capable and to be able to reproducibly 
produce finished product of the intended quality. The in process controls are adequate for this 
pharmaceutical form.  
The batch analysis data on pilot scale and production scale batches shows that the medicinal product 
can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for description, identification 
(HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, water content (KF), 
degradation products (HPLC) and microbial quality. 
All analytical procedures and test methods have been adequately described and the validation 
data presented is acceptable.      
Batch data including production scale batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and 
indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  batches  stored  in  a  container  closure  system  equivalent  to  that  proposed  for 
marketing were provided under long term conditions for up to 18 months (25 ºC/60 % RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerate conditions (40 ºC/75 % RH), in line with ICH guidelines.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/73 
 
 
 
 
Samples were tested for description, related substances, assay, dissolution and water content. 
Photostability studies were conducted and indicate that drug product is not sensitive to light. 
All investigated parameters remain within specified limits. The stability studies provided support the 
shelf-life under the storage conditions declared in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  support  of  their  MAA,  Lundbeck  submitted  a  complete  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic 
and  toxicology  programme  for  nalmefene.  Pharmacological  as  well  as  toxicological  properties  of  the 
drug were comprehensively investigated and published in scientific journals.  The data submitted were 
assessed on the legal basis of the application, applicable guidelines and other scientific criteria. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Nalmefene was tested in a full and comprehensive non-clinical strategy comprising appropriate studies 
on pharmacology, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamics drug interactions. The testing strategy 
followed  the  package  of  guidelines  of  both  ICH  and  CHMP.  Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  in 
compliance with the GLP requirements.   
Primary Pharmacology 
Nalmefene was tested in a full and comprehensive non-clinical strategy comprising appropriate studies 
on pharmacology, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamics drug interactions. The testing strategy 
followed  the  package  of  guidelines  of  both  ICH  and  CHMP.  Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  in 
compliance  with  the  GLP  requirements  with  the  exception  of  one  study  (Cardiovascular  action  of  an 
intravenous  dose  of  nalmefene  in  dogs).  However,  since  the  results  of  this  study  confirm  the  results 
obtained in another GLP-compliant study in the same specie (BTT31-PD025), the results obtained were 
considered adequate. 
Comprehensive in vitro studies were performed to characterize the mode of action of nalmefene. It has 
been  shown  that  nalmefene  is  a  selective  opioid  receptor  ligand  without  any  significant  affinity  to 
targets apart from opioid receptors. On the opioid receptor subtypes nalmefene has equal high affinity 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 11/73 
 
 
 
 
for  μ,  and  κ  opioid  receptors  respectively,  and  medium  affinity  for  δ  opioid  receptors.  The  binding 
affinity of nalmefene at opioid receptor subtypes is summarized in the table below:

With respect of functional activity, the drug behaves as moderately potent δ opioid antagonist and as a 
potent  κ  opioid  partial  agonist.  The  functional  activity  of  nalmefene  at  µ  opioid  receptors  in  vitro  is 
dependent on the biological test system. In contrast to the in vitro studies nalmefene acts clearly as a 
µ  opioid  antagonist  without  any  agonistic  activity  under  in  vivo  conditions.  This  has  been  shown  in 
established  animal  models  reflecting  µ  receptor  specificity  (tail-flick  test,  writhing  test,  tail  skin 
temperature, morphine antagonism in rhesus monkeys). 
The  main  metabolite  of  nalmefene  in  rats  is  nornalmefene,  which  showed  some  agonist  activity  in 
guinea  pig  membrane  and  in  the  rat  tail  flick  and  hot  plate  test  (intrathekal administration),  but  was 
without  any  agonistic  activity  after  systemic  administration.  Nalmefene-3-O-glucuronide,  a  major 
metabolite in dog and man, was inactive at μ opioid receptors. Thus, the activity of nornalmefene-3-O-
glucuronide at the opioid receptors is unlikely to contribute to the pharmacological effect of nalmefene 
in humans. Nalmefene 3-O sulphate, a minor human metabolite displayed the same receptor profile as 
well as functional activity as the parent drug. 
As shown in three models of alcohol-dependent rats, nalmefene significantly reduced voluntary alcohol 
consumption. The effect was still present 24 hours after the last injection, which can be explained by 
the  slow  dissociation  rate  of  nalmefene  from  the  µ  opioid  receptor.  Under  the  conditions  of  repeated 
administration, the effect remained stable. With respect of the potential clinical usage of nalmefene, it 
should  be  noted  that  nalmefene  prevented  an  alcohol  deprivation  effect,  i.e.  an  increase  in  alcohol 
consumption  after  a  prolonged  period  of  alcohol  abstinence.  Therefore,  the  non-clinical  data  support 
the clinical use of nalmefene. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
No  specific  secondary  pharmacology  studies  were  performed.  The  potential  dependence  liability  of 
nalmefene was assessed in rhesus monkeys (see other toxicity studies, section 2.3.4). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular system 
The effect of nalmefene on the cardiovascular system has been extensively studied. Both under in vitro 
and  in  vivo  conditions  defined  effects  have  been  observed.  Dose-dependent  inhibition  of  HERG-1  tail 
current without any other abnormal features such as pre and after depolarization were found, but this 
effect  occurred  at  concentration  approximately  12-fold  to  300-fold  the  clinically  relevant  range.  In 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 12/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purkinje  fibres  a  moderate  decrease  of  APD  was  observed.  A  thorough  study  in  telemetered  dogs 
revealed  consistently  a  significant  prolongation  of  the  QRS  duration  after  an  oral  dose  of  25  or  50 
mg/kg. Taking into consideration that the doses used were far above pharmacodynamic relevant range 
and the small effect even after 50 mg/kg, it is concluded that this effect is without clinical relevance.  
Respiratory system 
Nalmefene had no significant effects on the respiration rate or tidal volume of rats when administered 
at  50,  100  and  150  mg/kg.  At  the  highest  dose  the  corresponding  plasma  concentration  (C max)  of 
nalmefene was in the range from 754 to 3406 ng/ml. 
Central nervous system 
In  the  IRWIN  test  for  central  effects  no  significant  gross  behavioural  or  physiological  changes  were 
observed  in  rats  orally  administered  50  mg/kg.  Higher  doses  produced  consistent  effects  on 
neurological behaviour (passivity, increased touch response, increased grip strength, urination). Other 
behavioural  endpoints  were  evaluated  in  the  studies  performed  to  assess  dependence  (see  other 
toxicity studies, section 2.3.4). 
In summary, the pharmacology data demonstrate that nalmefene is an opioid system modulator with a 
distinct  profile  on  µ,  κ,  and  δ opioid  receptors  without  any  significant  affinity  to  targets  apart  from 
opioid receptors. With respect to the scientific rationale, it has been shown in accepted animal models 
of  alcohol  dependence,  that  nalmefene  effectively  suppresses  voluntary  alcohol  intake  even  after 
repeated administration. The results of the safety pharmacology studies do not raise concerns. 
The  CHMP  noted  the  lack  of  a  κ  opioid  receptor  occupancy  study.  The  applicant  acknowledged  the 
possible involvement of κ receptor activity as part of nalmefene’s mode of action, and explained that 
an appropriate receptor study was underway. Their strategy is to exactly reproduce the  experimental 
conditions described by Need et al (2007). The Applicant was requested to submit the κ opioid receptor 
occupancy data for review when completed. 
Pharmacodynamic Drug interactions 
The potential interaction of nalmefene with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was investigated 
using i.v. route in rats with an administration ratio of flumazenil/nalmefene of 23:1, since from earlier 
studies it was known that both drugs have the potential to elicit clonic seizures. Whereas for flumazenil 
and  nalmefene  the  CD50  (dose  that  elicits  clonic  seizures  in  50%  of  the  animals)  values  were  167.8 
and  7.45  mg/kg  respectively,  the  mixture  of  both  drugs  yielded  a  CD50  value  of  106.3  mg/kg,  thus 
pointing to sub-additive interaction. This is not likely to have clinical implications since the doses used 
were far higher than those used under clinical conditions. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  nalmefene  and/or  its  metabolites  were  evaluated  in  mice,  male  and  female 
rats,  dogs,  rabbits  and  humans.  In  addition,  human  blood,  HEK293  cells,  hepatic  microsomes  and 
hepatocytes  were  utilised  for  in  vitro  PK  assessment.  Analytical  methods  used  in  the  PK  studies  for 
determination  of  nalmefene  and/or  metabolites  were  validated  and  the  main  parameters  of  these 
methods were assessed and considered adequate. 
Absorption 
For  the  in  vivo  studies  oral  administration  of  nalmefene  was  used,  which  is  the  intended  route  for 
human  use.  Based  on  measurement  of  radioactivity  after  oral  administration  of  14C-nalmefene,  rapid 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 13/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absorption  with  rather  high  bioavailability  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs,  whereas  in  humans  only 
moderate bioavailability was found.  
Distribution 
Nalmefene is widely distributed, with the highest values found in liver, kidney and pancreas. It crosses 
the placental barrier and binds to melanin. In nursing rats, it was found in the milk at concentrations 3 
times that of plasma 1 h post dose, but decreased to half the plasma concentration by 24 h post-dose. 
Only trace amounts were detected in the brain. 
Metabolism 
Nalmefene  is  extensively  metabolized,  the  main  metabolites  being  nornalmefene,  nalmefene-3-O-
glucuronide,  nalmefene-3-O-sulphate  and  nornalmefene-3-O-glucuronide.  The  metabolizing  enzymes 
for nalmefene have been characterized as CYP3A4/5 for the conversion of nalmefene to nornalmefene 
and  UGT2B7  (major  metabolite,  see  section  2.4.2),  UGT1A3,  UGT1A8  for  the  glucuronidation  of 
nalmefene  to  nalmefene-3-O-glucuronide.  The  results  of  the  metabolism  studies  revealed  that  both 
rats and dogs are suitable species for the safety evaluation of nalmefene. 
Excretion 
Only 5 – 14% of the parent compound was found in urine and faeces. The metabolic profile was similar 
in  rats,  dogs  and  humans,  with  the  rat  being  closest  to  humans.  No  significant  gender  differences 
(rats,  dogs)  were  observed.  In  rats  and  dogs,  the  faecal  elimination  represented  the  main  route  of 
excretion  of  drug  related  material,  whereas  in  humans  renal  elimination  was  higher  than  the  faecal 
excretion. 
Drug-drug interactions 
Data  indicate  a  very  low  probability  of  metabolic  interactions  of  nalmefene  and  its  major  metabolites 
via both CYP450 and UGT. Data presented suggest that nalmefene is neither a substrate for the human 
multi-drug  resistance  transporters  (MDR1,  BCRP,  MRP2,  organic  anion  transporter  polypeptides 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1) nor does it inhibit these transporters.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In  single-dose  studies,  nalmefene  was  administered  by  the  oral,  iv  and  sc  route  to  mice,  rats  and 
rabbits of both sexes. The respective oral LD50 values were 230 and <200 mg/kg for male and female 
mice, <300 and 150 mg/kg for male and female rats and <225 and 225 for male and female rabbits. 
Toxic  signs  in  the  lower  doses  included  unsteady  gait,  decreased  activity,  arched  back  and  tremors; 
convulsions, prostration and loss of balance / righting reflex were seen with higher doses. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 14/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Chronic toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. For pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs were used, since, with respect to their metabolic pattern, these species cover 
the human situation in an acceptable manner. Treatment with up to 52 weeks with sufficient high oral 
doses of nalmefene resulted in rather minor clinical signs. 
Rats  treated  over  52  weeks  with  nalmefene  did  not  develop  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  at  the  doses 
tested.  The  only  symptoms  seen  in  rats  after  300  mg/kg  were  a  moderate  decrease  of  body  weight 
gain  concomitantly  with  reduction  of  food  consumption.  Some  parameters  of  haematology,  serum 
chemistry  and  urine  analysis  were  slightly  changed.  However,  since  the  effects  were  neither  dose-
related  nor  time-related,  no  specific  concern  was  identified.  There  were  some  statistically  significant 
differences  in  organ  weights  (heart,  lung,  liver,  spleen)  between  nalmefene-treated  groups  and 
controls, but neither macroscopic nor histopatholoical examination revealed striking changes. However, 
some  minor  and  insignificant  increases  in  the  rate  of  nephrocalcinosis  in  the  kidneys  in  high  dose 
females and cortical hyperplasia in the adrenals of mid and high dose females were seen. Therefore, no 
target organs were identified in this species. The NOAEL after 52 weeks treatment was set at an oral 
dose of 300 mg/kg.  
Dogs  treated  with  nalmefene  for  52  weeks  showed  some  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  (salivation, 
hypoactivity,  hyperactivity, 
tremor  and  convulsions  (16  and  64  mg/kg/day).  Additionally, 
haematological  analysis  showed  a  trend  towards  haemoconcentration,  increase  in  mean  cell 
haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and reductions in platelets. The NOAEL for this study was set at 4 
mg/kg. Since no histopathological findings were found, no target organ in dogs could be defined. 
Although    neither  rats  nor  dogs  showed  any  changes  in  the  liver  after  repeated  administration  of 
nalmefene,  dose-dependent  changes  has  been  observed  in  the liver  of  male and  female mice: in  two 
studies  both  an  increase  in  mean  liver  weight  (33  –  69%)  and  periportal  hepatocellular  hypertrophy 
with  minor  foci  of  single  cell  or  focal  necrosis  were  described.  Although  no  scientific  explanation  for 
these  marked  effects  is  available  at  present,  it  seems  justified  to  consider  this  as  a  species-specific 
phenomenon. 
The  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP  requirements 
according to the respective guidelines.  
Genotoxicity 
From  the  submitted  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  studies,  and  mainly  based  on  the  overall  data 
including lack of carcinogenicity of the compound, it can be concluded that nalmefene has no relevant 
genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  with  nalmefene  did  not  provide  evidence  for  a 
carcinogenic potential of nalmefene at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
With  regard  to  reproductive  toxicity,  in  two  studies  conducted  in  rats  (fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development,  and  combined  fertility/pre-  and  postnatal  development  study)  male  and  female  fertility 
as  well  as  early  embryonic  development  was  unaffected  by  oral  treatment  with  nalmefene 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 15/73 
 
 
 
 
hydrochloride up to 200 mg/kg/d, a dose which induced mortality, CNS toxicity and adverse effects on 
body  weights  in  the  parental  generation.   After  dose  reduction  from  200  mg/kg/d  to  100  mg/kg/d  at 
the end of the mating period in the combined fertility/pre- and postnatal development study,  no CNS 
toxicity was observed any more. Male rats appeared to be more sensitive to nalmefene hydrochloride 
as body weight gain was already adversely affected at the mid dose group (20 mg/kg/d) in the fertility 
and early embryonic development study.  
When nalmefene hydrochloride up to 200 mg/kg/d was administered orally to pregnant rats during the 
period of organogenesis, embryofoetal development was not affected and the safety margin was 32 to 
38 times the human AUC after the recommended maximum daily dose of 18.06 mg/kg.  
The oral administration of nalmefene hydrochloride up to 200 mg/kg/d to pregnant rabbits during the 
period of organogenesis induced only slight materno-toxicity, but induced significantly decreased foetal 
body weights and increased skeletal variations indicating retardation of foetal development.  
Another  prenatal  development  study  with  intravenous  administration  of  nalmefene  hydrochloride  was 
conducted in rabbits. The high dose of 8 mg/kg/d was clearly materno-toxic and in two doses (one of 
the mid and one of the high dose each) ascites was noted at necropsy. This finding was considered to 
be  treatment-related  revealing  a  maternal  NOAEL  of  0.25  mg/kg/d.  Embryofoetal  development  after 
intravenous  administration  was  only  affected  at  the  high  dose  of  8  mg/kg/d  (slight  increase  in  the 
number  of  does  with  all  conceptuses  resorbed,  significant  increase  in  foetal  and  litter  incidence  for 
skeletal variations) and the NOAEL was set at 1.25 mg/kg/d. When calculation of the safety margin for 
prenatal development is based on dose per kg body weight, a safety margin of 4.2 would exist.  
No treatment-related teratogenicity was observed in either species. 
In rats, data from the combined fertility/pre- and postnatal development study as well as from a peri- 
and  postnatal  development  study  were  available.  In  both  studies  materno-toxicity,  an  increase  in 
number of dams with stillborn pups and a decrease in pup survival were observed at the high dose of 
100  mg/kg/d.  Whilst  the  decrease  in  pup  survival  is  likely  due  to  maternal  neglect,  the  cause  of  the 
increase in dams with stillborn pups is unknown.  
When neonatal rats were dosed with nalmefene hydrochloride from birth until weaning with doses up 
to 50 mg/kg/d subcutaneously, no effects on body weights, viability, lactation, and cumulative survival 
index  were  noted  and  developmental  milestones  were  not  affected  either.  Histopathological 
examination  revealed  no  drug-related  effects,  as  the  findings  were  seen  in  all  groups  including  the 
control group without any dose-dependent increase.  
Toxicokinetic data 
The  toxicokinetic  profile  of  nalmefene  was  determined  within  the  pivotal  toxicology  studies  or  in 
separate  studies  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  In  most  cases,  plasma  concentrations  of  nalmefene  and  its 
metabolites  nornalmefene,  conjugated  nalmefene  (i.e.  the  sum  of  nalmefene  glucuronide  and 
nalmefene  sulphate)  and  conjugated  nornalmefene  (i.e.  the  sum  of  nornalmefene  glucuronide  and 
nornalmefene sulphate) were determined. Both in rats and dogs the parent compound nalmefene was 
only detectable within the first hour in animals treated with high doses. In rats and dogs, the levels of 
the main metabolites nornalmefene, nalmefene glucuronide and nornalmefene glucuronide were much 
higher  compared  to  nalmefene,  suggesting  rapid  metabolism  of  the  parent  drug.  No  accumulation  of 
nalmefene and/or metabolites could be observed after 52 weeks of administration.  
In summary, the toxicokinetic parameters show that the metabolic profile of rats and dogs is similar to 
the profile observed in humans. Therefore, repeat dose studies in rats and dogs are relevant for safety 
Selincro

assessment.  The  toxicokinetic  parameters  are  similar  with  respect  to  dogs  and  humans,  but  different 
between rats and humans.  
The  calculation  of  the  safety  margins  for  male  and  female  fertility  was  based  on  mean  plasma 
concentrations  that  were  obtained  for  proof  of  absorption  of  the  drug  substance.  At  the  NOAEL  for 
fertility (200 mg/kg/d) safety margins were 64 to 244 times the human Cmax after the recommended 
maximum daily dose of 18.06 mg. 
At  the  developmental  (rabbit  study)  NOAEL  of  10  mg/kg/d  no  safety  margin  exists  (AUC:  35.29  – 
39.46  ng*h/ml  compared  to  AUC  of  131  ng*h/ml  after  maximum  human  daily  dose  of  18.06  mg 
nalmefene). 
The  developmental  NOAELs  in  both  studies  performed  in  rats  were  similar  (20  mg/kg/d  and  15 
mg/kg/d,  respectively).  When  calculation  of  the  safety  margin  for  developmental  toxicity  is  based  on 
mean  plasma  concentrations  that  were  obtained  for  proof  of  absorption  of  the  drug  substance  in  the 
combined  fertility/pre-  and  postnatal  development  study,  exposures  were  15  to  18  times  the  human 
Cmax after the recommended maximum daily dose of 18.06 mg. 
Local Tolerance 
Local  tolerance  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  were  carried  out  as  required.  Taking  into  account  the 
intended route of administration under clinical conditions the results of the local tolerance studies did 
not indicate any concerns. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity was evaluated in vivo in mice and guinea pigs. There was no evidence to suggest that the 
test  material,  nalmefene,  acts  as  sensitizer.  Therefore,  nalmefene  was  not  regarded  as  allergenic. 
Nalmefene  may  have  the  potential  for  induction  of  allergic  contact  dermatitis.  However,  taking  into 
account the intended route of administration under clinical conditions this is not a concern. 
The potential dependence liability of nalmefene was tested in three different tests. It was shown that 
the  drug  acts  like  a  powerful  opioid  antagonist  without  any  agonistic  activity.  The  drug  is  free  of 
physical dependence liability and therefore unlikely to be abused. 
Since  bisnalmefene  was  found  to  be  a  potential  degradation  product  of  nalmefene,  the  acute 
intravenous  toxicity  of  the  substance  has  been  tested  in  mice.  The  median  lethal  dose  was  133.6 
mg/kg, which reflects a considerably lower toxicity than that for nalmefene. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  provided  a  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  according  to  the 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1 (June 2006). 
Phase I - PBT-Screening 
The applicant provided data on the octanol-water partition coefficient indicating that the trigger value 
of 4.5 for log Kow is not exceeded. Hence, no further screening for PBT is necessary.

Based  on  the  above  risk  quotients  and  results,  it  was  concluded  that  nalmefene  is  unlikely  to  bio-
accumulate  to  a  significant  extent.  The  PEC/PNEC  coefficients  for  algae,  daphnia,  fish  and  sediment 
dwelling organisms indicate that nalmefene is unlikely to present a risk to surface water. Furthermore, 
nalmefene  does  not  absorb  much  neither  to  sewage  sludge  nor  to  soil.  Hence,  nalmefene  is  likely  to 
remain mainly in the aqueous phase. There is no risk for sediment dwelling organisms. Due to the very 
low  adsorption  to  sludge,  an  environmental  risk  assessment  for  the  terrestrial  compartment  was  not 
required. 
In  summary,  it  was  concluded  that,  based  on  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  18.06  mg  nalmefene 
hydrochloride,  the  prescribed  usage  of  nalmefene  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the  aquatic  or 
terrestrial environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Comprehensive in vitro studies have shown that nalmefene is a selective opioid receptor ligand without 
any  significant  affinity  to  targets  apart  from  opioid  receptors.  On  the  opioid  receptor  subtypes 
nalmefene has equal high affinity for μ, and κ opioid receptors respectively, and medium affinity for δ 
opioid receptors.  
In contrast to the in vitro studies nalmefene acts clearly as a µ opioid antagonist without any agonistic 
activity under in vivo conditions. 
Overall, the data demonstrate that nalmefene is an opioid system modulator with a distinct profile on 
µ,  κ,  and  δ  opioid  receptors  without  any  significant  affinity  to  targets  apart  from  opioid  receptors. 
Accepted  animal  models  of  alcohol  dependence,  showed  that  nalmefene  effectively  suppresses 
voluntary  alcohol  intake  even  after  repeated  administration.  The  results  of  the  safety  studies  do  not 
raise concerns. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of nalmefene  have  been  investigated  and  the  scientific  quality  of the  studies  is 
considered adequate. The studies conducted confirmed that both rats and dogs are suitable species for 
the safety evaluation. With respect to the pharmacokinetic properties, it was concluded that nalmefene 
met the requirements to support this Marketing Authorisation application. 
Repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs.  The  toxicokinetic 
parameters are similar with respect to dogs and humans, but different between rats and humans.  
From the submitted in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, it could be concluded that nalmefene has 
no relevant genotoxic potential.  
Long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  with  nalmefene  did  not  provide  evidence  for  a 
carcinogenic potential of nalmefene at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. 
With  regard  to  reproductive  toxicity,  in  two  studies  conducted  in  rats  (fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development,  and  combined  fertility/pre-  and  postnatal  development  study)  male  and  female  fertility 
as  well  as  early  embryonic  development  was  unaffected  by  oral  treatment  with  nalmefene 
hydrochloride up to 200 mg/kg/d. After dose reduction to 100 mg/kg/d at the end of the mating period 
in  the  combined  fertility/pre-  and  postnatal  development  study,  no  CNS  toxicity  was  observed  any 
more.  
Oral  administration  of  nalmefene  hydrochloride  up  to  200  mg/kg/d  to  pregnant  rabbits  during  the 
period of organogenesis induced only slight materno-toxicity, but induced significantly decreased foetal 
body weights and increased skeletal variations indicating retardation of foetal development.

No treatment-related teratogenicity was observed in either rats or rabbits. 
With  regards  to  the  environmental  risk  assessment,  nalmefene  is  unlikely  to  bioaccumulate  to  a 
significant extent and is unlikely to present a risk to surface water. Furthermore, Nalmefene does not 
much adsorb neither to sewage sludge nor to soil. It was concluded that, based on a maximum daily 
dose of 18.06 mg of nalmefene, the prescribed usage of the nalmefene is unlikely to represent a risk 
for the aquatic or terrestrial environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  nalmefene  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements  to  support  this  application.  All  issues  related  to  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicology were resolved. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant provided a statement to the effect that parts of the clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Several 
of  the  other  studies  were  initiated  before  to  the  Directive  came  into  force.  These  studies  were 
conducted according to the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki”. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nalmefene 18 mg IR tablets are to be taken as needed, i.e. on each day the patient perceives a 
propensity to drinking alcohol, as a single one-tablet dose, preferably 1-2 hours prior to the anticipated 
time of drinking. Available in-vitro biopharmaceutical, as well as in-vivo and modelling PK data support 
the proposed on-demand dosing schedule.  
Absorption  
Nalmefene is highly water-soluble, the proposed IR tablets rapidly dissolve in-vitro and display a rate 
and  extent  of  absorption  of  nalmefene,  that  is  equivalent  to  an  oral  solution  formulation.  After 
ingestion  of  a  single  18  mg  tablet,  mean  maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  16.5ng/mL  (22.3ng/mL 
after multiple days of single daily doses) are achieved after 1.5 hours with an AUC0-inf value of about 
130ngh/mL (AUC0-tau after multiple doses 154ngh/mL, Integrated PK analysis Study 14019A).  
Food effect 
Results on the influence of food on nalmefene’s absorption are somehow inconsistent. Ingestion of food 
(standardised  meal,  however,  not  high-fat  according  to  guideline  provisions)  delayed  achievement  of 
maximum  plasma  concentration  by  about  one  hour  (from  1.35  to  2.33h)  and  increased  the  overall 
extent of absorption by about 19% (3x18.06 mg doses, Study IX313-003). Additionally, in food study 
CPH-101-1302, delivery of NMF after food ingestion was increased. After ingestion of a high-fat meal 
plasma peak concentrations increased by about 50% and the extent of absorption (AUC) increased by 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 21/73 
 
 
 
 
 
about  30%.  Peak  plasma  concentrations  were  attained  about  30  minutes  later  as  compared  to  the 
fasted  state  (1  vs  1.5  h).  However,  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  fed  and  fasted 
condition observed in Japanese volunteers in study 13505A. Overall, data on the influence of food do 
not point to a significant food effect requiring particular dosing recommendations for nalmefene. In the 
SmPC (Section 4.2), Selincro is to be taken with or without food (which is concordant with the method 
of administration in the pivotal phase III studies). 
Distribution 
Nalmefene  is  extensively  metabolised.  The  biotransformations  include  hydroxylation,  N-dealkylation, 
glucuronic  acid  conjugation,  and  sulphation.  The  primary  enzyme  responsible  for  conversion  to  the 
major metabolite nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide is UGT2B7. A small portion of nalmefene is converted to 
nornalmefene  (de-alkylated  nalmefene)  mainly  through  CYP3A4/5.  Nornalmefene  is  then  further 
converted to nornalmefene 3-O-glucuronide and to nornalmefene 3-O-sulphate. 
Nalmefene  3-O-glucuronide,  nornalmefene,  nornalmefene  3-O-glucuronide,  and  nornalmefene  3-O-
sulphate  have  less  affinity  (26  to  1100  times  lower)  for  the  opioid  receptors  than  the  parent 
compound. The nalmefene 3-O-sulphate metabolite is considered to have potency comparable to that 
of  nalmefene  on  the  opioid  receptors.  However,  since  this  metabolite  is  present  in  concentrations  of 
less  than  10%  of  that  of  nalmefene,  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  the  nalmefene  3-O-sulphate 
metabolite be a major contributor to the pharmacological effect of nalmefene in humans 
Elimination 
Following  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  18  mg  14C-nalmefene  to  healthy  subjects  in  distribution 
study 12393A, renal excretion represented the main route of elimination, with a mean of 71% of total 
radioactivity excreted in urine compared to a mean of 20% in faeces. Nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide was 
the major metabolite in urine, accounting for approximately 54% of the administered dose, while only 
trace  amounts  of  intact  nalmefene  (3%)  were  excreted  in  urine.  Nornalmefene  was  the  predominant 
metabolite in faeces. The elimination half-life is about 12.5  hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study 14019A / Integrated PK analysis 
An  integrated  database  regrouping  PK  parameters  from  several  studies  with  single  or  multiple  dose 
administration, with different formulations and diverse doses has been created. In order to be able to 
compare the parameters between the differing studies, dose-normalization was carried out.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
PK  data  for  oral  administration  of  18  mg  NMF  tablets  in  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  renal 
impairment  as  compared  to  healthy  subjects  are  not  available.  In  study  22  (an  early  open-label, 
single-dose  study),  eight  patients  with  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  were  administered  1  mg  NMF 
as  i.v.  bolus  injection  over  15  seconds  on  two  occasions:  one  time  the  day  after  a  haemodialysis 
session and once four hours before the next scheduled haemodialysis with a wash-out of 1-2 weeks in-
between. Exposure to nalmefene-conjugates was largely increased in end stage renal impairment (AUC 
values  more  than  eight  times  higher).  De-conjugation  (and  consequently  re-institution  of 
pharmacological  activity)  of  metabolites  or  parent  compounds  has  been  reported  if  conjugated 
molecules  cannot  be  eliminated.  Healthy  subjects  were  not  directly  involved  in  study  22.  Instead, 
healthy subject data were taken from study 21, conducted in 1993 in order to examine the influence of

hepatic impairment after 2 mg i.v. bolus administration of NMF. Selincro is contraindicated in patients 
with  severe  renal  impairment.  Based  on  the  available  data,  differentiated  dose  recommendations  or 
warning  notes  for  various  degrees  of  renal  impairment  could  not  be  formulated.    This  is  reflected  in 
Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Hepatic impairment 
The  impact  of  hepatic  impairment  was  examined  in  Study  12417A  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate 
hepatic  impairment,  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  The  systemic  exposure  to  nalmefene,  based  on 
AUC0-inf,  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  subjects  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
(1.5-  and  2.9-fold  higher,  respectively)  than  in  healthy  subjects.  Subjects  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment were not included and have also been excluded from the pivotal phase III studies. Selincro 
is  contraindicated 
impairment.  Clear  differentiated  dose 
recommendations  for  patients  with  various  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment  cannot  be  given  based  on 
the current database. This is reflected in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In-vitro  interaction  studies  demonstrated  that  nalmefene  did  not  induce  enzyme  activity or  affect  the 
mRNA  levels  of  any  of  the  CYP  enzymes  evaluated  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19,  and  CYP3A4/5)  and  showed  no  or  little  inhibitory  potency  (direct  or  time-dependent) 
towards any of the CYP enzymes tested. 
The  in-vivo  alcohol  interaction  study  13513  did  not  point  to  a  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic 
interaction between nalmefene and ethanol. The 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio was within the 
standard bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for the AUC0-t and the AUC0-inf of nalmefene as well as 
for the AUC0-t and the Cmax of ethanol. For the Cmax of nalmefene, subsequent exposure to ethanol 
was associated with an increase of 23%. However, the interaction between NMF and ethanol was not 
examined  over  a  range  of  increasing  blood  alcohol  concentrations,  but  at  a  single  fixed  amount,  i.e. 
after administration of 0.6 g/kg body weight. The Cmax values (mmol/mL) of ethanol corresponded to 
a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of approximately 0.5 to 0.6‰ for men and women. Hence, data 
for the interaction between NMF and larger ethanol quantities (heavy drinking) are not available.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nalmefene  is  an  opioid  system  modulator  with  a  distinct  μ,  δ,  and  κ  receptor  profile.  In  vitro  studies 
have demonstrated that nalmefene is a selective opioid receptor ligand with antagonist activity at the μ 
and δ receptors and partial agonist activity at the κ receptor. Acute alcohol intake was shown to result 
in mesolimbic dopamine release (facilitated by the release of β-endorphins), which can provide positive 
reinforcement.  Nalmefene  is  thought  to  counteract  the  reinforcement  effects  and  to  reduce  alcohol 
consumption, possibly by modulating these cortico-mesolimbic functions.  
Primary pharmacology 
Study CPH-101-0902 
Study CPH-101-0902 was an open-label, two-period, single- and multiple-dose study (conducted by 
the former licensee Biotie Therapies Corp. in 2002) in 12 healthy young subjects. The objective was to 
characterise the pharmacokinetics and the μ-opioid receptor occupancy in the brain after a single dose 
and after 7 days of dosing of 18.06 mg nalmefene. Blood was sampled for the analysis of nalmefene, 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 23/73 
 
 
 
 
 
nornalmefene, and their conjugates after the single dose and after the last repeated dose, at matching 
time points, up to 72 hours post-dose. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters of nalmefene are 
summarised in the Panel below. 
Opioid receptor occupancy 
In Study CPH-101-0902 the μ-opioid receptor occupancy in the brain after single and multiple dosing 
of 18.06 mg nalmefene was examined by performing positron emission tomography (PET) scans. One 
single  18.06  mg  dose  and  repeated  daily  dosing  of  18.06  mg  nalmefene  for  7  days  resulted  in  very 
high  occupancy  at  the  μ-opioid  receptors  (94  to  100%)  measured  3  hours  post-dose.  The  decline  in 
occupancy  was  similar for  single  and  repeated  dosing,  and  was  clearly  slower  than  the  decline in  the 
plasma  concentration  of  nalmefene  or  metabolites.  The  high  nalmefene  occupancy  (83  to  100%) 
persisted  26  hours  after  single  and  repeated  dosing  and  the  receptor  occupancy  was  still above  50% 
50 hours after dosing. Demonstration of rapid and long-lasting high µ-opioid receptor occupancy after 
single doses of nalmefene provides pharmacodynamic support for the proposed once-daily, as-needed 
dosing  schedule  on  the  one  side,  but  has  safety  consequences  on  the  other  side.  Concomitant 
administration  of  opioid  analgesics  is  contraindicated,  i.e.  nalmefene  is  to  be  discontinued  in  case 
opioid analgesia is required (e.g. in elective surgery) and respective warning notes are in the SmPC to 
alert the treating physician in case of emergency situations.  
Study CPH-101-0199  
Study  CPH-101-0199  was  an  early  phase  I  proof-of-concept  study,  conducted  in  experienced 
recreational  drinkers  that  did  not  fulfil  the  criteria  for  being  categorised  as  being  alcohol  dependent. 
Participants  went  through  three  4-hour  drinking  sessions  with  free  access  to  a  maximum  of  twelve 
drinks (8 g alcohol each). Before the first session (baseline) no drugs were administered, three hours 
before the following two experimental sessions two dose levels of nalmefene hydrochloride (20 mg or 
60 mg) or 50 mg of naltrexone as a positive control were administered.  
The  number  of  included  subjects  was  low  (n=8  in  each  arm),  therefore  data  should  be  interpreted 
cautiously.  However,  it  appears  that  after  a  kind  of  adaption  period  (no  significant  reduction  in  the 
number of drinks in all four treatment arms in the first experimental session), alcohol consumption was 
markedly reduced in all three verum groups during the second experimental session. For NMF 20 mg, 
NMF 60 mg and NTX 50 mg the number of drinks declined from 11-12 in the first experimental session 
to 1-2 in the second experimental session. There was virtually no placebo response with regard to the 
number of drinks. Although the study was conducted under double blind conditions, it may be assumed 
that participants soon recognized administration of placebo tablets. This may also be reflected by the 
fact that none of the subjects randomized to the placebo group reported any AEs either during or after 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 24/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the second experimental session, whereas gastrointestinal and CNS-related AEs occurred in all verum 
groups.  
Contrary to the observed reduction in the number of drinks, no indication for differences in time to the 
first, second or third drink could be found when the treatment groups were compared with each other. 
There were no consistent statistically significant differences between the groups in the VAS scores for 
feeling  of  intoxication  and  pleasure  measured  before  the  first,  second  and  third  drinks,  and  no 
statistically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  maxima  and  minima  of 
changes from the first score during the baseline session. 
Symptoms  indicative  of  restless  legs  were  reported  by  three  subjects  receiving  nalmefene.  This 
adverse event was not observed in earlier NMF studies. 
Based on these early proof-of-concept data, it is concluded that nalmefene may reduce the number of 
drinks  consumed  by  recreational  drinkers  in  a  social  drinking  situation.  The  fact  that  a  number  of 
subjects  had  unpleasant  adverse  events  after  the  first  experimental  session,  but  none  reported  any 
adverse  events  after  the  drug-free  baseline  session  probably  affected  the  outcome  of  the  second 
experimental session. It is yet unknown in how far tolerability of nalmefene improves in the course of 
longer treatment units.  
Secondary pharmacology 
QTc study BTT31-CD005 
Study BTT31-CD005 was a randomised double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, moxifloxacin-
controlled study, conducted at Parexel UK from November 2007 to July 2008, investigating the effects 
of nalmefene on cardiac repolarisation in healthy subjects.  
A total of 249 healthy men and women completed the study. The subjects were randomly allocated to 
receive  one  of  four  treatments  orally  for  7  days:  nalmefene  hydrochloride  20mg/day;  nalmefene 
hydrochloride  40mg/day  for  2  days,  followed  by  nalmefene  hydrochloride  80mg/day  for  5  days; 
placebo  for  7  days;  or  placebo  for  6  days,  followed  by  moxifloxacin  400mg  for  1  day.  Blood  for 
pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  nalmefene  and  nornalmefene  was  sampled  up  to  24  hours  after  the  last 
dose,  and  electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  were  recorded  during  the  dosing  period  and  on  Day  7  up  to  24 
hours  post-dose.  The  Primary  pharmacodynamic  variable  was  the  Placebo-adjusted  time-matched 
mean change from baseline in QT interval based on an individual correction method (QTcI). The mean 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  and  QTcI  levels  after  repeated  doses  of  20  or  80mg  nalmefene 
hydrochloride are summarised in the Panel below. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 25/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  lower  limit  of  the  90%  CI  was  above  zero  at  3,  6,  8,  and  12  hours  post-dose  for  nalmefene 
hydrochloride  20  mg  versus  placebo  and  at  1,  2,  6,  8  and  10  hours  post-dose  for  the  nalmefene 
hydrochloride 80 mg versus placebo comparison, demonstrating a small nalmefene QTcI prolongation 
effect. Based on the primary variable (QTcI) and mean time-matched changes from baseline on Day 7, 
the upper limit of the 90% CI fell below the 10 ms bound at all time-points post-dose. The study can 
therefore be classified as a “negative” thorough QT/QTc study as per definitions adopted in the current 
ICH E14 Guideline. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic studies include early studies on intravenous preparations and later studies on the oral 
preparation which is the subject of this application.  
Nalmefene is rapidly absorbed (tmax is 1.5 hours) after a single oral dose of 18 mg nalmefene (tablet), 
resulting  in  a  mean  Cmax  of  16.5ng/mL  and  a  mean  AUC0-inf  of  131ng∙h/mL.  The  absolute  oral 
bioavailability  of  nalmefene  was  41%.  Food  increases  the  bioavailability  to  53%,  which  is  considered 
unlikely to be of clinical significance, considering the wide therapeutic index.  
Following a single oral dose of 18 mg 14C-nalmefene, the mean total recovery of drug-related material 
was 91% 240 hours post-dose, with excretion of drug-related material essentially complete (89%) 120 
hours post-dose. Renal excretion represented the main route of elimination, with a mean of 71% (CV 
3.7%) of total radioactivity excreted in urine compared to a mean of 20% (CV 2.6%) in faeces. 
Metabolism  by  glucuronide  conjugation  is  the  primary  mechanism  of  clearance  for  nalmefene,  with 
renal excretion being the main route of elimination of nalmefene and its metabolites. 
Nalmefene  is  extensively  metabolised.  The  biotransformations  include  hydroxylation,  N-dealkylation, 
glucuronic acid conjugation, and sulphation. It undergoes extensive and rapid metabolism to its major 
metabolite nalmefene 3-Oglucuronide. 
The integrated pharmacokinetic analysis estimated the oral clearance of nalmefene to 169L/h, which is 
in  line  with  the  systemic  clearance  of  nalmefene  (CL)  of  60.1L/h  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic 
modelling.  The  elimination  half-life  was  estimated  to  12.5  hours  in  the  integrated  pharmacokinetic 
analysis. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic profile of nalmefene was well characterised. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Following a single oral dose, the systemic exposure to nalmefene, based on AUC0-inf, was statistically 
significantly greater for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, than for healthy subjects 
with  normal  hepatic  function  (1.5  and  2.9  times,  respectively).  Systemic  exposure  is  increased  in 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  It  was  not  possible  to  conclude  on  tolerability  on  the  basis  of  the 
limited numbers of 16 patients with hepatic impairment administered 18 mg nalmefene orally.  
Overall, there was a higher exposure to nalmefene and nalmefene conjugates in a very limited number 
of  patients  with  ESRD  administered  1mg  intravenously.  Oral  nalmefene  was  not  administered  to 
patients with renal disease. Thus, it was also not possible to conclude on the tolerability of nalmefene 
in renal disease on the basis of the data provided.  
The  influence  of  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  nalmefene  after  oral 
administration of 18 mg doses was not fully elucidated. Data on the use of nalmefene in patients with 
severe  hepatic  impairment  are  missing.  Severe  hepatic  impairment  may,  however,  be  frequently

encountered in the target population. Selincro is contraindicated in patients with severe renal or severe 
hepatic impairment.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and Main studies 
The  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  nalmefene  in  the  treatment  of  alcohol  dependence  were  evaluated  in 
three  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  studies  (two  confirmatory  6-month 
efficacy  studies  and  one  1-year  safety  study)  sponsored  by  Lundbeck  and  5  studies  in  alcohol  use 
disorders conducted by a company called Biotie.  
Overview of Clinical Studies in Alcohol Dependence and Alcohol-use Disorders  
Five  studies  in  alcohol-use  disorders  conducted  by  Biotie  as  part  of  a  development  programme 
suggested  that  nalmefene  could  be  effective  in  reducing  alcohol  consumption  and  provided  the 
rationale  for  the  further  development  of  the  nalmefene  18  mg  dose.  Studies  CPH101-0399  and  0299 
explored  fixed  dose  daily  dosing  strategies  using  doses  of  between  5mg  and  40mg  (of  nalmefene 
hydrochloride).  Data  from  these  studies  suggested  that  doses  below  18  mg  were  less  efficacious.  
However, no clear dose response relationship could be discerned in terms of the HDD endpoint. 
Figure 1: Tabular Summary of Clinical Studies in Alcohol-use Disorders (Biotie Sponsored) 
Studies  CPH-101-0701  and  Study  CPH-101-0801  were  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
28-week studies using a flexible-dose regime (10, 20 or 40mg of nalmefene hydrochloride), as-needed 
dosing and identified 18 mg as the target dose. The most recent of the five studies, Study CPH-101-
801,  was  a  28-week  phase  III  study  with  a  24-week  Run-out  Period.  Statistical  significance  was 
achieved in this study with a difference of 3HDDs (p = 0.0065; treatment-by-time interaction) between 
placebo  and  nalmefene.  Mean  dose  was  19.3mg  nalmefene  (as  hydrochloride),  and  the  proportion  of 
patients in the nalmefene group who did not change their dose in Months 1 to 7 ranged from 57% to 
66%. This suggested that 18 mg nalmefene was well tolerated and efficacious in this study population.  
The  studies  were  conducted  in  Finland,  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in  the  United  States,  in  patients 
with alcohol dependence or other alcohol-use disorders. The study designs were both double-blind and 
open-label,  and  the  dosing  was  either  as-needed  or  daily,  with  fixed  (5,  10,  20,  or  40mg)  or  flexible 
doses (ranging from 10 to 40mg) of nalmefene hydrochloride. A total of 1009 were included in these 
studies 349 of whom were treated with placebo and 660 of whom received nalmefene. 
These studies provided support for the 18 mg nalmefene dose used in the three main studies in alcohol 
dependence conducted by Lundbeck listed in figure 2 below. 
Selincro

Figure 2: Summary of main efficacy studies in Alcohol Dependence (Lundbeck-sponsored) 
In  these  studies,  the  patient  population  consisted  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence 
according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The three studies were conducted in different regions in Europe to 
ensure that different drinking cultures were represented.  
The  1-year  study  12013A  was  primarily  designed  to  collect  long-term  safety  data  on  nalmefene  to 
comply with the population exposure requirements for safety evaluation.  
The  two  6-month  (24-week)  efficacy  studies  12014A  and  12023A  were  of  identical  designs.  For  this 
reason  their  design  is  summarised  in  the  same  figure  3  below.  Assessment  of  other  aspects  of  these 
two studies is also dealt with together in sections of this assessment that follow.

Methods 
The  studies  were  conducted  applying  an  outpatient  setting  without  preceding  detoxification.  Higher 
CIWA  withdrawal  scores  at  Screening  as  well  as  a  history  of  delirium  tremens  and  seizures  would  be

indicative for the necessity of prior inpatient detoxification. Patients with abuse of substance other than 
alcohol and subjects with significant depressive or psychotic co-morbidity were excluded.  
The  studies  included  outpatients,  aged  ≥18  years,  with  a  primary  diagnosis  of  AD.  A  patient  was 
eligible for participation in the study if, in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit (Baseline period), 
he/she  had  >  6  HDDs,  at  least  a  medium  DRL,  and  <  14  consecutive  abstinent  days.  The  timeline 
followback (TLFB) method was used to obtain estimates of the patient’s daily drinking. 
The studies were conducted over a 34 week period (12 visits) in total and consisted of four sequential 
periods: a 2-week screening period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, a 4-week double-blind 
placebo-controlled run-out in each of the treatment arms and finally a 4-week safety follow-up. One to 
two  weeks  after  the  Screening  Visit  the  patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  24  weeks  of  as-needed, 
double-blind treatment (Main Treatment Period; MTP) with nalmefene (18 mg) or placebo. The patients 
who  completed  24  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment  entered  a  4-week,  double-blind  Run-out  Period 
(ROP).  The  patients  randomised  to  nalmefene  were  re-randomised  1:1  to  receive  nalmefene  (18  mg, 
as-needed) or placebo and the patients randomised to placebo continued on placebo. 
The  Timeline  Follow-back  (TLFB)  method  was  used  to  collect  self-reported  drinking  data  (alcohol 
consumption).  
The  TLFB  is  a  method  to  obtain  estimates  of  daily  drinking.  Using  memory  aids,  such  as  a  calendar, 
patients  provide  retrospective  estimates  of  the  number  of  standard  drinks  for  each  day.  A  day  was 
defined  as  a  24-hour  period  starting  at  6.00  a.m.  and  ending  at  6.00  a.m.  the  following  morning.  At 
the Screening Visit, each patient was to provide a retrospective estimate of his/her daily drinking over 
the  previous  month  (a  month  was  defined  as  a  period  of  28  consecutive  days).  At  each  subsequent 
visit,  the  patient  was  to  provide  information  on  his/her  drinking  since  the  previous  visit.  If  a  patient 
missed  a  visit,  the  TLFB  that  was  completed  at  the  next  visit  was  extended  to  cover  the  days  that 
should  have  been  recorded  at  the  missing  visit.  Patients  could  use  their  personal  calendars  to  help 
them recalling their drinking or they could use a calendar provided by the site for their personal use. 
Calendars were only to be used as a memory aid to support the patients’ input to TLFB. The patients 
were  asked  to  report  their  alcohol  intake  by  standard  units  according  to  the  national  definition  of  a 
standard unit. The standard national units were defined in standard drink conversion cards distributed 
to the patients. 
The  patients’  alcohol  intake  (g/day)  was  estimated  based  on  national  definitions  of  standard  units 
(subsequently  converted  into  grams  of  alcohol).  To  define  the  standard  units,  a  standard  drink 
conversion card was distributed to each patient at the  Screening Visit. Each patient was also provided 
with  a  calendar  that  he/she  could  use  to  support  his/her  input  to  the  TLFB,  or  he/she  could  use  a 
personal calendar, if preferred.  For all the variables derived from the TLFB data, baseline was defined 
as the month (that is, 4 weeks /28 consecutive days) preceding the Screening Visit. The investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) was taken as-needed. Each patient was instructed  to take a maximum of one 
tablet on each day the patient perceived a risk of drinking alcohol,  preferably 1 to 2 hours prior to the 
anticipated time of drinking. If the patient had started  drinking alcohol without taking IMP, the patient 
was  to  take  one  tablet  as  soon  as  possible.  The  dates  when  IMP  was  taken/not  taken  were  recorded 
using  the  TLFB  method.  The  chosen  comparator  was  placebo,  as  there  is  currently  no  approved 
medicinal product for the reduction of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence.  
All participants took part in a psychosocial programme (BRENDA) to enhance medication and treatment 
compliance  at  each  visit.  BRENDA,  a  motivational  and  adherence-enhancing  intervention,  was 
administered to all the patients throughout the treatment period in all three studies, in accordance with 
the  EMA  Guideline  on  alcohol  dependence,  which  states  that  standardised  psychosocial  interventions 
should be allowed in alcohol dependence studies and kept to a constant and low level for all patients. 
BRENDA  was  administered  using  the  accompanying  manual,  by  trained  site  personnel  (such  as 
investigators, nurses, and psychologists) who were instructed to limit the sessions to approximately 15 
Selincro

to  30  minutes  (except  for  the  first  session,  administered  at  randomisation,  which  was  approximately 
30 to 40 minutes). 
Studies  12014A  and  12023A  followed  the  same  design.  They  were  conducted  in  different  European 
countries in order to reflect different regional patterns or traditions of alcohol drinking, as follows: 
- Study 12014A (n=604) was conducted in Austria, Finland, Germany, and Sweden;  
-  Study  12023A  (n=718)  was  conducted  in  Belgium,  Czech  Republic,  France,  Italy,  Poland,  Portugal 
and Spain. 
Study Participants  
The  patients  had  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence  diagnosed  according  to  DSM-IV-TR.  men  and 
women, aged 18 years or over were included. A patient was eligible for participation in the study if, in 
the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit, he/she had: 
• ≥6 HDDs 
• at least a medium DRL 
• ≤14 consecutive abstinent days 
Alcohol  dependence  was  diagnosed  according  to  the  DSM-IV-TR  criteria,  using  the  Mini  International 
Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI).  Patients  with  other  concomitant  Axis  I  psychiatric  disorders  or 
significant  somatic  morbidity  were  excluded,  as  was  any  patient  who  was  at  risk  of  suicide,  or  who 
used substances of abuse (other than alcohol, cannabis, nicotine and benzodiazepines).  
A patient was also excluded if he/she had (selected criteria are summarised below): 
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
withdrawal  symptoms  requiring  medication  (a  Clinical  Institute  Withdrawal  Assessment  for 
Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar), Revised, score ≥10) 
a history of delirium tremens or alcohol withdrawal seizures 
a  cognitive impairment  that  was  likely  to  interfere  with  his/her  understanding  of  the  study  and 
its procedures 
an  aspartate  aminotransferase  (ASAT)  or  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALAT)  value  >3  times  the 
upper limit of the reference range, or a laboratory value outside the reference range (based on 
samples taken at the Screening Visit) that was clinically significant, as judged by the investigator 
clinically significant abnormal vital signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
current  or  recent  treatment  with  antipsychotics  or  antidepressants.  Furthermore,  a  patient  had 
to provide a stable address and telephone number and an identified locator person. 
Patients  with  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  are  representative  of  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  alcohol 
dependence in the general population and are the patients on which both the EMA Scientific Advice and 
the EMA Guideline on alcohol dependence place the most emphasis. However, patients with a medium 
DRL  were  also  included  in  the  studies,  as  the  Applicant  considered  that  these  patients  also  have  an 
increased risk of harm to their health. 
The ratio of men to women was approximately 2:1. The patients in Study 12014A were slightly older 
(52 vs 45 years) and had a later onset of alcohol problems (38 versus 32 years) than the patients in 
Study  12023A.    The  majority  (ranging  between  65%  and  75%)  of  the  patients  had  a  secondary 
education/high  school  education,  or  higher.  At  screening,  approximately  60%  of  the  patients  were 
employed and approximately 60% of them were living with a spouse or partner.

Treatments 
The  IMPs  were  tablets  of  18  mg  nalmefene  and  placebo,  identical  in  appearance,  for  oral 
administration. The IMPs were supplied in wallet cards. The wallet cards had space for the patients to 
record the date of IMP intake. All the tablets were manufactured, packaged, and labelled in accordance 
with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice, under the responsibility of H.Lundbeck A/S. 
In  the  studies  conducted  by  the  Applicant,  all  participants,  including  those  allocated  to  placebo, 
received  a  motivational  and  adherence-enhancing  intervention  (BRENDA)  throughout  the  treatment 
period.  BRENDA  is  a  psychosocial  intervention  consisting  of  the  following  six  components  1) 
Biopsychosocial evaluation; 2) Report to the patient on assessment; 3) Empathic understanding of the 
patient’s situation; 4) Needs collaboratively identified by the patient and treatment provider; 5) Direct 
advice  to  the  patient  on  how  to  meet  those  needs;  6)  Assess  reaction  of  the  patient  to  advice  and 
adjust as necessary for best care. BRENDA was provided at week 0 (randomisation), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 
20,  24  (end  of  double-blind  period),  and  week  28  (end  of  run-out  period).  The  BRENDA  approach  is 
described in the literature (Starosta et al. 2006).  
In  Studies  12014A  and  12023A,  in  conjunction  with  psychosocial  intervention,  the  patients  in  the 
nalmefene group took IMP, on average, on 48% and 57% of the days, respectively, and the patients in 
the placebo group took IMP, on average, on approximately 65% of the days.  
In  the  studies,  the  IMP  was  to  be  taken  on  an  as-needed  basis:  the  patient  was  instructed  to  take  a 
maximum  of  one  tablet  each  day  the  patient  perceived  a  risk  of  drinking  alcohol,  preferably  1  to  2 
hours prior to the anticipated time of drinking. If the patient had started drinking without taking IMP, 
the patient was to take one tablet as soon as possible. If there was no risk of drinking on a given day, 
the  patient  was  not  to  take  any  IMP.  The  as-needed  dosing  schedule  had  no  precedent  in  the 
pharmacologic treatment of AD. 
The  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  adhered  to  the  as-needed  dosing  regimen  on  approximately 
80% to 90% of the days. 
Objectives 
- Primary Objectives 
The  overall  objective  of  the  study  12023A  was  the  same  as  for  Study  12014A,  i.e.  to  evaluate  the 
effect  of  as-needed  dosing  of  18.06  mg  nalmefene  on  alcohol  consumption  in  patients  with  alcohol 
dependence during a 24-week treatment period. 
- Secondary Objectives 
•  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  as-needed  use  of  18  mg  nalmefene  in  patients  with  alcohol  dependence 
during a treatment period of 24 weeks on: 
–  proportion of responders based on various drinking measures 
–  alcohol dependence symptoms and clinical status 
– 
–  pharmacoeconomic outcomes 
liver function and other clinical safety laboratory tests 
•  to evaluate treatment withdrawal effects after 24 weeks of as-needed nalmefene treatment 
•  to  evaluate the  safety  and  tolerability  of  as-needed  use  of  18 mg  nalmefene  in  patients  with  alcohol 
dependence 
•  to explore how genotype may affect treatment response to nalmefene

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
The  changes  from  baseline  to  Month  6  in  number  of  Heavy  Drinking  Days  (HDDs)  and  Total  alcohol 
consumption (TAC) were defined as the two co-primary efficacy endpoints, as follows: 
1. Number of HDDs (defined as a day with alcohol consumption ≥60g for men and ≥40g for women) 
2. Total alcohol consumption (TAC, defined as mean daily alcohol consumption in g/day over a month 
(= 28 days) 
The  WHO  has  defined  risk  categories  for  health  problems  based  on  the  level  of  daily  alcohol 
consumption and these categories were used to define response, as a measure of the clinical relevance 
of the reduction in alcohol consumption.  
Secondary endpoints 
In all studies, the key secondary endpoint was response at Month 6, where response was defined as a 
downward shift from baseline in WHO DRL (RSDRL for patients with a very high DRL at baseline, a shift 
to medium DRL or lower [two-category shift]; for patients with a high DRL at baseline, a shift to low 
DRL  [two-category  shift];  and  for  patients  with  a  medium  DRL  at  baseline,  a  shift  to  low  DRL  [one-
category shift]), as summarised below: 
−  for patients with Very High Risk at baseline: Shift to Medium Risk or below; 
−  for patients with High and Medium Risk at baseline: Shift to Low Risk or below. 
The  risk  levels  are  defined  in  the  WHO  ‘International  guide  for  monitoring  alcohol  consumption  and 
related harm’: 
Other secondary endpoints were: 
•  Responder analyses:  
-  proportion  of  patients  with  ≥30%,  ≥50%  and  ≥70%  reduction  from  baseline  I  in  monthly 
total alcohol consumption 
– RLDRL response (defined as a downward shift in DRL to low risk or below) 
•  no heavy drinking days (no HDDs) by month 
•  Number of non-drinking days (NDDs) 
•  Alcohol Dependence symptoms and clinical status at visits in the first 24-week treatment period. 
•  Change  from  baseline  in  Drinker  Inventory  of  Consequences  (DrInc),  The  DrInC  is  a  self-
administered 50-item questionnaire designed to measure adverse consequences of alcohol abuse 
in five areas: Interpersonal, Physical, Social, Impulsive, and Intrapersonal.

•  Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)(clinician assessed), 7-point scale.  1, very much 
improved;  2,  much  improved;  3,  minimally  improved;  4,  no  change;  5,  minimally  worse;  6, 
much worse; or 7, very much worse 
•  Change  from  baseline  in  Clinical  Global  Impression-Severity  CGI-S,  (Clinical  Global  Impression 
Severity  Scale):  7-point  scale.  1=  normal,  not  at  all  ill;  2=  borderline  ill;  3=  mildly  ill;  4= 
moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6= severely ill; 7= among the most extremely ill patients 
•  Alcohol  Dependence  Scale  (ADS  total  score)  25  items  covering  alcohol  withdrawal  symptoms, 
impaired  control  over  drinking,  awareness  of  a  compulsion  to  drink,  increased  tolerance  to 
alcohol, and  drink-seeking behaviour. 
•  Liver function and other biological laboratory tests at visits in the first 24 weeks of treatment 
-  Serum  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (s-GGT)  serum  alanine  amino  transferase  (s-ALAT) 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) 
Sample size 
Based on previous clinical experience, Standard Deviations for the change from baseline HDD and the 
change  from  baseline  TAC  were  found  to  be  7  days  and  36.5  g/day,  respectively.  With a  significance 
level  of  5%  for  each  of  the  tests,  300  patients  per  treatment  group  would  therefore  provide  around 
90% power for detecting treatment differences in both the two co-primary variables, in case the true 
differences would be 3 heavy drinking days and 12 g/day in the total consumption. This evaluation was 
calculated  by  simulation  and  assuming  a  correlation  of  0.7  between  the  co-primary  endpoints  and 
dropout at month 6.  
In  study  12023A,  the  sample  size  was  increased  to  700  patients  (350  patients  in  each  treatment 
group)  after  a  blinded  review  of  the  data  indicated  higher  than  anticipated  standard  deviations  and 
lower  than  anticipated  correlations  for  the  co-primary  endpoints.  As  this  retrospective  power  analysis 
resulting in an increased sample was conducted prior to unblinding, it was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups according to a randomisation list 
computer-generated  by  H.  Lundbeck  A/S.  At  each  study  site,  the  investigator  was  responsible  for 
assigning the IMP in consecutive order, starting with the lowest number available. 
Blinding (masking) 
Two sets of sealed envelopes containing IMP details for each patient were prepared. One set was kept 
by  each  of  the  following:  Global  Pharmacovigilance,  H.Lundbeck  A/S,  and  the  investigator  or 
pharmacist.  The  randomisation  code  was  to  be  broken  by  the  investigator  only  in  an  emergency 
situation in order to give the patient optimal treatment. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  pivotal  6-month  placebo-controlled  trials  were  all  double-blind  in  study 
design.  All  participants  were  blinded  to  outcomes.  The  method  for  sequence  generation  in  the 
randomisation process and the allocation concealment were adequate. 
Statistical methods 
Co-primary Efficacy Analyses 
The Applicant defined various analysis populations: 
1. 
All-patients-randomised set (APRS) – all randomised patients. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 33/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
3. 
All-patients-treated set (APTS) – all patients in the APRS excluding those with no recorded IMP 
intake and all IMP returned. 
Full-analysis  set  (FAS)  –  all  patients  in  the  APTS  who  had  at  least  one  valid  post-baseline 
assessment. 
Baseline  characteristics,  demographics,  and  concomitant  medication  were  summarised  for  the  APRS. 
Exposure  was  summarised  for  the  APTS.  All  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  on  the  FAS.  All  safety 
analyses were conducted on the APTS; pre-treatment adverse events were summarised for the APRS. 
The co-primary analyses of efficacy were the changes from Baseline I in monthly number of HDDs and 
monthly  TAC  in  the  nalmefene  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  Both  co-primary  efficacy 
variables concerned the treatment effect at Month 6. Superiority of nalmefene over placebo was tested 
at  the  2-sided  5%  significance  level,  with  the  null  hypothesis  being no  difference  between  nalmefene 
and placebo, and the alternative hypothesis a difference between treatments. 
The efficacy analyses were conducted on the full-analysis set (FAS). The primary analysis pre-specified 
for  both  co-primary  efficacy  variables  was  a  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  analysis  using 
all available data measured over each month during the treatment period using a model with Baseline I 
score as covariate, site, sex, time and treatment as fixed effects, baseline-by-time and treatment-by-
time  interaction  and  an  unstructured  covariance  matrix.  The  MMRM  analysis  provides  an  estimate  of 
the  treatment  effect  under  the  assumption  that  data  are  missing  at  random.  Monthly  observations 
were disregarded if there were <7 days of data. 
Several  sensitivity  analyses  (analyses  of  covariance  (ANCOVAs)  using  observed  cases  (OC),  last 
observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  and  baseline  observation  carried  forward  (BOCF))  were  pre-
specified  to  evaluate  how  different  assumptions  would  influence  the  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect 
and  the  robustness  of  the  results.  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  were  pre-specified  in  the  Statistical 
Analysis  Plan  for  one  of  the  6-month  efficacy  studies  (Study  12023A).  These  sensitivity  analyses 
included placebo mean imputation (PMI) and multiple imputation with a pattern mixture model. Details 
of these sensitivity analyses are below: 
- MMRM analysis in which monthly observations were disregarded if there were <14 days of data. 
-  Analyses  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  by  month  with  the  Baseline  I  score  as  a  covariate  and  site,  sex, 
and  treatment  as  fixed  effects,  using  the  OC,  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF),  or  baseline 
observation carried forward (BOCF) method of imputation. For each month, treatment effects and the 
difference  in  treatment  effects  were  estimated  from  the  model.  The  estimates  were  presented  with 
two-sided 95% CIs and corresponding p-values.  
-  ANCOVA  analyses  were  performed  (post-hoc  for  study  12014A)  in  which  missing  values  were 
imputed using placebo mean imputation (PMI) based on the mean reduction observed at Month 1 in 
the placebo group (adjusted for sex). 
-  Multiple  imputation  analyses  with  a  pattern  mixture  model  were  performed  (post-hoc  for  study 
12014A)  assuming  that  the  patients  who  drop  out  differ  from  completers  and  that  the  future 
behaviour of their outcomes (conditional on the past) is the same as those in the placebo group (with 
the same past). 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  number  of  HDDs  and  TAC  in  the  Main  treatment  period  (MTP)  were 
performed for the patients with a high or very high DRL at Baseline I, using an MMRM model similar to 
that  used  for  the  primary  efficacy  analyses.  In  addition,  post-hoc  ANCOVA  analyses  were  performed 
using LOCF for the patients with a high or very high DRL at Baseline I. 
To  address  the  observation  that  some  patients  started  to  reduce  their  alcohol  consumption 
immediately after they had consented to participate in the study (i.e. at the Screening Visit), post-hoc 
analyses  of  the  co-primary  variables  were  performed  to  estimate  the  effect  of  nalmefene  versus 
placebo in the patients who, at the time of randomisation, still fulfilled the requirements pre-specified 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 34/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the protocol regarding alcohol consumption for the Screening Visit. Based on TLFB data, the patients 
were classified as having (yes/no) at least a medium DRL and at least 6 HDDs in the period between 
screening  and  randomisation  (extrapolated  to  4  weeks).  These  analyses  were  performed  using  the 
primary  MMRM  model  including  alcohol  consumption  at  randomisation  (yes/no)-by-time-by-treatment 
interaction  with  randomisation  score  as  response  assuming  no  systematic  difference  between  the 
treatment groups. ANCOVA analyses using LOCF were also performed including alcohol consumption at 
randomisation by-treatment interaction. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The  key  secondary  analysis  (RSDRL)  was  performed  using  a  logistic  regression  (LREG)  model.  The 
same  methods  for  handling  missing  data  were  applied  in  all  three  studies  (missing  values  were 
imputed as non-response, using MMRM-predicted TAC, and using LOCF and LOCF sustained response), 
although the imputation method that was pre-specified for the key secondary analysis differed between 
Study 12014A and Studies 12023A. Prior to unblinding of any study, a Statistical Analysis Plan (Meta-
analysis  SAP)  for  a  pooled  analysis  of  the  key  secondary  endpoint  across  the  Lundbeck  studies  was 
issued.  The  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  was  amended  twice:  in  the  first  amendment  (Meta-analysis  SAP 
1),  the  analysis  strategy  was  aligned  with  the  overall  strategy  for  analysing  the  co-primary  variable 
TAC;  in  the  second  amendment  (Meta-analysis  SAP  2),  which  was  issued  prior  to  unblinding  Study 
12023A, the pooling of the two 6-month efficacy studies only was introduced.

Results 
Participant flows 
Participant flow Study 12014A 
A  total  of  56%  of  the  patients  completed  the  study:  68%  in  the  placebo  group  and  46%  in  the 
nalmefene  group.  During  the  MTP,  31%  of  the  placebo-treated  patients  and  53%  of  the  nalmefene-
treated  patients  withdrew  from  the  study;  the  most  frequent  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  was 
withdrawal of consent in the placebo group and adverse events in the nalmefene group. The proportion 
of  patients  with  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  in  the  Main  Treatment  Period  (MTP)  was 
approximately three times higher in the nalmefene group than in the placebo group. The majority of all 
withdrawals occurred in the MTP, and almost all (>95%) of the patients in each treatment group who 
entered the ROP completed the period. In the MTP, time to withdrawal for any reason shows a pattern 
of earlier withdrawal in the nalmefene group than in the placebo group. 
Overall 44% of participants withdrew, which was higher than the anticipated 35% withdrawal rate. In 
Study  12014A,  the  withdrawals  occurred  earlier  in  the  nalmefene  group  than  in  the  placebo  group. 
There was a 22% higher withdrawal rate from the nalmefene group than the placebo group primarily 
driven mainly by a higher reporting rate of adverse events over the six month period. The numbers of 
participants withdrawing due to withdrawal of consent was high.

Participant flow for study 12023A 
A  total  of  59%  of  the  patients  completed  the  study:  61%  in  the  placebo  group  and  57%  in  the 
nalmefene  group.  During  the  MTP,  38%  of  the  placebo-treated  patients  and  41%  of  the  nalmefene-
treated  patients  withdrew  from  the  study;  the  most  frequent  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  was 
withdrawal  of  consent  in  the  placebo  and  nalmefene  groups.  The  proportion  of  APTS  patients  with 
adverse events leading to withdrawal in the MTP was approximately two times higher in the nalmefene 
group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  of all  withdrawals  occurred in  the  MTP,  and  almost  all 
(>95%)  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  group  who  entered  the  ROP  completed  the  period. 
Approximately 51% and 27% of the patients in the placebo and nalmefene groups, respectively, who 
withdrew  their  consent  did  so  in  Month  6.  Approximately  50%  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  and 
nalmefene  groups  who  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  protocol  violations  did  so  in  Month  6  of  the 
MTP; there were no other clear trends. 
Overall 41% of participants withdrew. The patterns of withdrawal were similar for both nalmefene and 
placebo  groups.  The  rate  of  withdrawal increased  over  the  duration  of  the  study.  The  majority  of  the 
participants  withdrew  because  of  withdrawal  of  consent  or  protocol  violations.  The  rate  of  withdrawal 
due to adverse events was lower than in study 12014A.

In Study 12014A, the proportion of patients who withdrew was higher in the nalmefene group than in 
the placebo group, whereas in Study 12023A, the proportion of patients who withdrew was similar in 
both  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  reason  for  premature  discontinuation  were  adverse  event 
and  withdrawal  of  consent  (withdrawals  occurred  earlier  in  the  nalmefene  group  than  in  the  placebo 
group  in  Study  12014A,  primarily  driven  by  the  greater  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  due  to 
adverse  events  in  the  nalmefene  group  than  in  the  placebo  group),  whereas  the  time  to  withdrawal 
was  similar  in  the  nalmefene  and  placebo  groups  in  Study  12023A.  In  each  study,  the  patients  who 
withdrew,  in  general,  did  not  increase  their  alcohol  consumption  up  to  the  time  of  withdrawal, 
irrespective  of  the  reason  for  withdrawal.  For  the  majority  of  the  patients  who  withdrew,  alcohol 
consumption  was  stable  (or  decreasing)  up  to  the  time  of  withdrawal.  The  majority  of  the  withdrawn 
patients who became responders did so early in the course of treatment and did not subsequently shift 
to  being  a  non-responder.  In  Studies  12014A  and  12023A,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew 
and  the  time  to  withdrawal  in  the  patients  with  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  were  similar  to 
those in the corresponding total population. 
Recruitment 
Study 12014A was conducted in 4 countries (over 39 sites – 4 in Austria, 11 in Finland, 16 in Germany, 
and 8 in Sweden between 18 December 2008 and 14 October 2010. 
Study 12023A was conducted in 7 countries (over 57 sites – 7 in Belgium, 3 in the Czech Republic, 16 
in  France,  10  in  Italy,  7  in  Poland,  4  in  Portugal,  and  10  in  Spain)  from  16  March  2009  to  22  March 
2011. 
The study participants were recruited from in- and out-patient clinics, from the study sites’ own patient 
pool,  by  referrals  to  the  study  site,  or  using  advertisements.  Advertisements  were  used  in  all  the 
countries in 12014A and in 4 of the countries in 12023A. 
Conduct of the studies 
Although  the  studies  were  designed  and  conducted  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  EMA  Guideline  on 
alcohol  dependence  the  key  elements  of  the  study  designs  were  in  line  with the  recommendations  of 
the EMA guidance. Each study was conducted as outlined in the protocol and subsequent amendments. 
The investigators were specialists and/or physicians with experience relevant to the studies. 
The following protocol deviations in Study 12014A resulted in patients’ exclusion from the full analysis 
set  
• 
• 
Patient 3557 was excluded from the FAS as the patient was randomised without any TLFB data 
for the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit. 
Patients  3054,  3059,  and  3532  were  excluded  from  the  FAS  as  the  patients  had  an  average 
alcohol consumption ≤40grams of ethanol/day in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit 
In  Study  12023A,  the  following  deviations  resulted  in  the  following  patients  being  excluded  from  the 
FAS: Patients 3068, 3119, 3124, 3243, 3400, 3489, 3608, 3630, 3667, 3679, and 3911 were excluded 
from  the  FAS  as  the  patients  had  an  average  alcohol  consumption  ≤40grams  ofethanol/day  in  the  4 
weeks  preceding  the  Screening  Visit.  An  additional  4  patients  (3010,  3164,  3353  and  3612)  had 
<6HDDs in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit but were randomised. 
Baseline data 
At baseline, approximately 80% of the patients in each of the studies had a high or very high DRL and 
approximately 20% of the patients had a medium DRL, which translated into a mean of approximately 
20HDDs per  month (out of 28 days  per month) and a mean  TAC of approximately 85 to 90g/day. At 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

baseline, the patients drank alcohol on most days, and both on weekdays and on weekends. It should 
be noted that only 4% of the patients had >7 consecutive non-drinking days/month at baseline. With 
their high level of alcohol consumption, the pattern of drinking in the total population was above and 
beyond any “normal” variations in cultural drinking patterns that exist across Europe. 
Numbers analysed 
Study 12014A included n=604 randomised patients (306 NMF + 298 PBO) 
Study 12023A included n=718 randomised patients (358 NMF + 360 PBO) 
Study 12013A included n=675 randomised patients (509 NMF + 166 PBO) 
Total: 1997 (1173 NMF + 824 PBO) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The main results of studies 12014A and 12023A and of Study 12013A are presented individually. 
- Study 12014A 
The  co-primary  efficacy  analyses  were  the  changes  from  Baseline  I  in  monthly  number  of  HDDs  and 
TAC. Nalmefene was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing both the number of HDDs 
(p = 0.002) and TAC (p < 0.001) at Month 6. The effect of nalmefene was evident already at Month 1 
and  maintained  throughout  the  MTP.  In  the  nalmefene  group,  the  mean  number  of  HDDs  decreased 
from  19  to  7  days/month  and  the  mean  TAC  decreased  from  84g/day  to  30g/day  at  Month  6,  a 
reduction of approximately 64%. In the placebo group, the mean number of HDDs decreased from 20 
to 10 days/month and the mean TAC decreased from 85g/day to 43g/day at Month 6, a reduction of 
approximately 50%.

Results for the Co-primary Efficacy Variables at Month 6 (FAS) –Study 12014A 
Additional analyses for Study 12014A 
For each of the co-primary variables, the ANCOVA sensitivity analyses using LOCF, OC, PMI and BOCF 
were  conducted.  ANCOVA  sensitivity  analyses  using  LOCF,  OC,  PMI  showed  that  nalmefene  was 
superior  to  placebo,  In  the  ANCOVA,  BOCF  analysis,  the  changes  from  baseline  were  similar  in  both 
treatment groups but with placebo being marginally more effective. 
For  the  majority  of  the  patients  who withdrew,  alcohol  consumption  was  stable  (or  decreasing)  up  to 
the  time  of  withdrawal.  LOCF  analysis  could  be  considered  to  be  conservative  in  this  situation. 
Statistical significance was achieved in favour of nalmefene for this analysis, albeit the treatment effect 
estimate was small and clinical significance of a reduction of 1.7 HDDs and -8.8 g/day of alcohol was 
considered unclear. 
- Study 12023A 
The  co-primary  efficacy  analyses  were  the  changes  from  Baseline  I  in  monthly  number  of  HDDs  and 
TAC.

Changes from Baseline in HDDs and TAC (FAS, MMRM) – Study 12023A 
HDDs 
Nalmefene  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  (p  =  0.012)  in  reducing  the  number  of 
HDDs at Month 6, with a mean difference to placebo of 1.7 days. At Baseline I, the mean number of 
HDDs  was  18  in  the  placebo  group  and  20  in  the  nalmefene  group.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  mean 
number of HDDs decreased to 10 at Month 1 and further to 7 at Month 6. In the nalmefene group, the 
mean  number  of  HDDs  decreased  to  9  at  Month  1  and  further  to  7  at  Month  6.  The  reduction  in  the 
mean number of HDDs was in favour of nalmefene (p <0.05) from month 1 and throughout the MTP 
(except at Month 4). 
TAC 
At  Month  6,  the  mean  reduction  in  TAC  was  numerically  greater  in  the  nalmefene  group  than  in  the 
placebo  group,  with  a  mean  difference  to  placebo  of  5g/day.  The  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant (p = 0.088). The reduction in TAC was in favour of nalmefene (p <0.05) from Month 1 and 
throughout the MTP (except at Month 4 and Month 6;  In absolute terms at Baseline I, the mean TAC 
was  89g/day  in  the  placebo  group  and  93g/day  in  the  nalmefene  group.  In  the  placebo  group,  the 
mean  TAC  decreased  to  46g/day  at  Month  1  and  further  to  33g/day  at  Month  6.  In  the  nalmefene 
group, the mean TAC decreased to 39g/day at Month 1 and further to 30g/day at Month 6. 
Results for the Co-primary Efficacy Variables at Month 6 (FAS) –Study 12023A 
Additional analyses for Study 12023A 
For  each  of  the  co-primary  variables,  all  the  ANCOVA  sensitivity  analyses  using  LOCF,  OC,  PMI,  or 
BOCF  were  calculated.  For  HDDs  the  ANCOVA  using  OC,  LOCF,  or  PMI  showed  that  nalmefene  was 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo.  Statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  for  the  BOCF 
analysis.  An  MMRM  analysis  in  which  Site  BE006  was  excluded  gave  results  similar  to  those  of  the 
primary analysis. 
Adjusted Changes from Baseline I in HDD:                                               Adjusted Changes 
from Baseline I in TAC 
For change from baseline in TAC the ANCOVA, LOCF and PMI analyses were all statistically significantly 
in  favour  of  nalmefene.  In  the  OC  analyses,  the  difference  to  placebo  was  slightly  larger  than  in  the 
primary analysis, but not statistically significant.    
Subgroup of patients with high or very high DRL at baseline and randomisation 
The  differences  in  treatment  effect  between  nalmefene  and  placebo,  and  the  reduction  in  alcohol 
consumption  in  terms  of  reduction  in  HDDs  and  TAC  was  inconsistent  across  the  various  sensitivity 
analyses (MMRM, LOCF, OC, PMI, MI and BOCF), and there was a degree of uncertainty regarding the 
precise  magnitude  of  the  beneficial  effects  (or  which  analytical  method  between  was  best  suited  to 
measure it) and its clinical relevance in the total population. 
Therefore,  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  to  substantiate  the  clinical  efficacy  and  the 
clinical relevance of nalmefene, and most particularly in order to define a population where the benefit 
of Selincro would be greatest. The Applicant performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis including patients 
with high or very high Drinking Risk Level (DRL) at baseline and who maintained a high or very high 
DRL at randomisation. A number of analytical methods were used to evaluate the data (MMRM, LOCF, 
OC, PMI, MI and BOCF). See panels below 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 42/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  treatment  effect  was  larger  in  the  patients  with  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  and 
randomisation than in the total population. At Month 6, the mean difference to placebo (MMRM) was -
3.7  HDDs/month  and  -18.3  g/day  in  Study  12014A,  and  -2.7  HDDs/month  and  -10.3  g/day  in  Study 
12023A.  
In addition to the above, to circumvent the complexity of selecting one imputation method over others, 
a further analysis was carried out, in which all withdrawals were treated as non-responders, looking at 
results  at  month  6  for  ‘completers’  (those  patients  who  had  maintained  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at 
randomisation, continued treatment and completed the study).  
In Study 12014A, the proportion of patients who withdrew was higher in the Selincro group than in the 
placebo group (50% versus 32%, respectively). For HDDs there were 23 days/month at baseline in the 
Selincro group (n=171) and 23 days/month at baseline in the placebo group (n=167).  For the patients 
who  continued  in  the  study  and  provided  efficacy  data  at  Month  6,  the  number  of  HDDs  was  9 
days/month in the Selincro group (n=85) and 14 days/month in the placebo group (n=114). The TAC 
was  102  g/day  at  baseline  in  the  Selincro  group  (n=171)  and  99  g/day  at  baseline  in  the  placebo 
group  (n=167).    For  the  patients  who  continued  in  the  study  and  provided  efficacy  data  at  Month  6, 
the TAC was 40 g/day in the Selincro-group (n=85) and 57 g/day in the placebo group (n=114). 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

In  Study  12023A,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Selincro  group 
than  in  the  placebo  group  (30%  versus  28%,  respectively).  For  HDDs  there  were  23  days/month  at 
baseline in the Selincro group (n=148) and 22 days/month at baseline in the placebo group (n=155).  
For  the  patients  who  continued  in  the  study  and  provided  efficacy  data  at  Month  6,  the  number  of 
HDDs  was  10  days/month  in  the  Selincro  group  (n=103)  and  12  days/month  in  the  placebo  group 
(n=111). The TAC was 113 g/day at baseline in the Selincro group (n=148) and 108 g/day at baseline 
in the placebo group (n=155).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided efficacy data 
at Month 6, the TAC was 44 g/day in the Selincro group (n=103) and 52 g/day in the placebo group 
(n=111).    
- Study 12013A (Persistence of efficacy: 52-week) 
Supportive  evidence  of  the  long-term  efficacy  of  nalmefene  in  the  treatment  of  AD  is  based  on  the 
results  from  the  52-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  (Study  12013A).  The  double  blind 
comparison of NMF vs placebo lasted over the entire 52 week treatment period, the last 4 weeks of the 
initial 24 weeks treatment were chosen for calculation of the co-primary efficacy endpoints (change in 
HDDs and TAC as compared to baseline). 
The baseline alcohol consumption of participants in study 12013A (15 HDDs, 75g/day TAC) was slightly 
below the drinking level observed at baseline for the pooled FAS of studies 12014A and 12023A (19.3 
HDDs, 87.7g/day TAC). 
A total of 675 patients were randomised (3:1 nalmefene to placebo) to the 52-week treatment period. 
In  the  NMF  treatment  arm  slightly  fewer  patients  withdrew  (38%)  despite  the  longer  treatment 
duration  as  compared  to  withdrawal  rates  in  the  NMF  treatment  arms  during  the  24-week  studies 
12014A and 12023A (54% and 43% withdrawal, respectively). 
Patient Disposition – Study 12013A  
In the NMF arm, the IMP was taken on about 48% of treatment days. In about every second of these 
days (23/48=47.9%) no alcohol was consumed thereafter. However, the portion of abstinence on days 
with IMP intake was about similar in the placebo arm (23/53=43.4%). Patients appeared to reliably be 
able  to  predict  days  with  high  drinking  liability.  In  the  vast  majority  of  days  without  IMP  intake,  no 
alcohol was drunk both in the NMF (44/51=86.3%) and in the placebo arm (42/47=89.4%). 
The  high  degree  of  study  adherence  (92%  for  NMF,  95%  for  placebo)  as  well  as  the  reliability  of  the 
patient’s self-assessment of drinking propensity on a particular day was supportive for the as-needed 
treatment regime proposed for nalmefene. 
Similarly  to  the  results  observed  in  studies  12014A  and  12023A,  the  difference  between  NMF  and 
placebo in reducing HDDs and TAC was small over the entire 52 week treatment period, leading to only 
numerical superiority at some assessment time points (e.g. Month 6, when the primary endpoint was 
defined)  and  to  statistically  significant  superiority  for  both  HDDs  and  TAC  at  the  end  of  the  52  week 
treatment period.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

The  main  treatment  effect  occurred  within  the  first  four  weeks.  Thereafter,  the  number  of  HDDs  and 
the  total  amount  of  alcohol  consumption  was  nearly  maintained  or  slightly  declined.  The  treatment 
effect  of  NMF  following  the  as-needed  administration  regimen  was  maintained  over  the  one-year 
observation period under double blind conditions. 
Fifty-two  percent  of  the  total  675  patients  had  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline.  Of  these,  52% 
(representing  27%  of  the  total  population)  continued  to  have  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at 
randomisation.  In  this  post-hoc  target  population  of  183  patients,  more  patients  receiving  nalmefene 
discontinued (63 [45%]) as compared to those receiving placebo (13 [31%]). For HDDs there were 19 
days/month  at  baseline  in  the  Selincro-group  (n=141)  and  19  days/month  at  baseline in  the  placebo 
group (n=42).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided efficacy data at 1 year, the 
number  of  HDDs  was  5  days/month  in  the  Selincro  group  (n=78)  and  10  days/month  in  the  placebo 
group  (n=  29).  The  TAC  was  100  g/day  at  baseline  in  the  Selincro  group  (n=141)  and  101  g/day  at 
baseline  in  the  placebo  group  (n=42).    For  the  patients  who  continued  in  the  study  and  provided 
efficacy  data  at  1  year,  the  TAC  was  24  g/day  in  the  Selincro  group  (n=78)  and  47  g/day  in  the 
placebo group (n=29). 
Summary of main efficacy results 
Efficacy  results  were  obtained  from  two  pivotal  trials  (study  12014A:  n=579,  study  12023A:  n=655) 
following identical study designs, covering different regions across Europe. The severity level of AD of 
included subjects was rather low (ADS score 13.6).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis – RSDRL 
RSDRL response was defined as a downward shift from baseline in DRL: 
- for patients with a very high DRL at baseline: a shift to medium DRL or below 
- for patients with a high or medium DRL at baseline: a shift to low DRL 
The key secondary efficacy analysis was performed on the pooled data from Studies 12014A, 12023A, 
and 12013A, as pre-specified prior to unblinding any of the studies, as well as on the pooled data from 
Studies 12014A and 12023A, as pre-specified prior to unblinding Study 12023A. The pooled data from 
Studies 12014A and 12023A, are considered here first. 
In the analysis of RSDRL using pooled data from Studies 12014A and 12023A, the odds ratio (OR) for 
response was in favour of nalmefene (OR = 1.49, p <0.01) when missing values were imputed using 
MMRM-predicted TAC values (Panel 79). 
The results of the responder analyses using different imputation methods were in favour of nalmefene, 
with  the  exception  of  the  analysis  that  imputed  missing  values  as  non-response  [NR]  (see  panel 
below).  
However,  for  the  majority  of  the  patients  who  withdrew,  their  alcohol  consumption  was  stable  (or 
decreasing) up to the time of withdrawal.  
In  the  analysis  of  RSDRL  in  the  patients  with  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  (pooled  data  from 
Studies 12014A and 12023A), the results were similar to those in the corresponding total population. 
In  the  analysis  of  RSDRL  using  pooled  data  from  Studies  12014A,  12023A,  and  12013A,  the  results 
were  consistent  with  those  using  pooled  data  from  Studies  12014A  and  12023A  (data  not  shown  in 
detail here).

RSDRL  analyses  show  that  for  the  pooled  data  significant  differences  for  nalmefene  compared  to 
placebo  were  observed.  Pooling  of  data  was  pre-specified.  The  results  of  the  pooled  12014A  and 
12023A dataset as show above are considered the most relevant. The responder analyses also rely on 
MMRM  predicted  TAC  estimates  therefore  considerations  on  missing  data  apply.  MMRM  results  show 
the response from the perspective of efficacy for patients adhering to treatment. The set of sensitivity 
analyses  allows  concluding  that  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  demonstrated,  as  they  are 
regarded as conservative response estimates.  
2.5.2.  Supportive studies 
The  Applicant  provided  further  analyses  on  the  expected  harm  reduction  (alcohol-related  physical 
health  outcomes,  injuries  or  social  consequences)  based  on  literature  data  as  well  as  modelling  from 
the clinical trial data to support the clinical benefit of the observed effect. 
Alcohol Consumption Modelling Report  
An Alcohol Consumption Modelling Report was provided modelling the consequences of heavy drinking 
days  and  total  alcohol  consumption  in  terms  of  alcohol-attributable  diseases  and  injuries.  Alcohol 
consumption  was  simulated,  day  by  day,  at  patient  level  for  12  months,  using  statistical  equations 
estimated  from  nalmefene  clinical  trial  data.  The  statistical  methods  used  for  simulation  are 
acceptable.  Individual  patient  data  for  HDDs  and  TAC  were  simulated.  Model  selection  for  odds  of 
drinking and count data for alcohol consumption was based more on empirical considerations than on 
theoretical assumptions, and was considered acceptable. The model was used to generate a dataset of 
200.000 untreated alcohol dependent patients. Using this dataset, it was possible to translate alcohol 
reduction  into  harm  reduction  by  modelling  the  consequences  of  alcohol  reduction  in  terms  of  health 
and  social  events,  thus  comparing  probabilities  of  events  between  different  groups  of  patients 
(according to the number of HDDs and TAC over 12 months).  
The number of HDDs over 1 year was divided into 8 categories with a range of 20 HDDs over a year, in 
order to represent a difference of 2 monthly HDDs vs placebo. For all diseases or injuries, the number 
of events increases with the number of HDDs per year both for male and female. 
The  TAC  per  year  was  divided  into  14  categories  with  a  range  of  3000g  over  a  year,  in  order  to 
represent the difference of a monthly average of 10g per day vs placebo.

The  modelling  data  represent  the  net  treatment  effect  of  nalmefene  over  placebo  and  point  to  a 
clinically relevant reduction of alcohol-associated events like transport injuries, ischemic heart disease, 
pancreatitis etc. if alcohol consumption is reduced to the degree that was achieved with nalmefene in 
the  chosen  patient  collective.  The  model  showed  that  even  a  moderate  decrease  in  drinking  levels 
might be associated with a decrease in both harmful events (e.g. mortality rates; accidents, see figure 
below)  and  a  decrease  in  relative  risk  of  the  medical  issues  typically  linked  to  excessive  alcohol 
drinking (e.g. liver cirrhosis). 
Alcohol Consumption Has an Exponential Relationship to Harmful Events –Risk of Death 
Furthermore,  systematic  literature  review  data  on  alcohol-related  physical  health  outcomes  were 
provided.  A  significant  reduction  of  mortality  was  calculated  by  correlating  the  net  drinking  amount 
reduction over placebo with epidemiological data.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  efficacy  of  nalmefene  in  the  Treatment  of  alcohol  dependence  with  an  as  needed  dose  of 
nalmefene 18 mg was evaluated in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: two 6-
month  studies  (Studies  12014A  and  12023A)  and  one  1-year  study  (Study  12013A).  In  all  three 
studies, the patient population consisted of patients with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according 
to the DSM-IV-TR™ criteria. 
All  participants  received  a  psychosocial  support  to  aid  compliance  called  BRENDA.  Efficacy  was 
evaluated  over  24  weeks  in  both  pivotal  studies  with  a  4  week  run-out  period.  The  duration  is 
reasonable for establishing a clinically significant reduction in alcohol consumption. Long-term efficacy 
was evaluated as a secondary objective of a one-year safety and tolerability study.   
The applicant designed their studies with harm reduction as a consequence of reduced alcohol as the 
main goal of treatment rather than as an intermediate step on the way to full abstinence.  
The number of Heavy Drinking Days (HDDs, defined as a day with alcohol consumption ≥60g for men 
and ≥40g for women) and Total alcohol consumption (TAC, defined as mean daily alcohol consumption 
in  g/day  over  28  days)  were  defined  as  co-primary  endpoints.  Among  numerous  other  secondary 
endpoints,  responder  analyses  in  terms  of  downward  shift  of  DRL  and  30/50/70%-reductions  of  TAC 
were performed. 
The  design  of  the  Applicant’s  pivotal  studies  was  acceptable  and  in  line  with  current  guideline 
provisions. 
Efficacy results 
In the total study population, the number of HDDs was reduced from 19.3 per month at baseline by -
11-12 per month with a net difference over placebo of -2.3 (p 0.002, study 12014A) and -1.7 (p 0.012, 
study 12023A) HDDs per month (MMRM). TAC (87.7g per day at baseline) was reduced by 50-60 g per 
day after 24 weeks with a net difference over placebo of -11.0 g/day (p<.001, study 12014A) and -4.9 
g/day (p 0.088, study 12023A). In summary:  
In study 12014A: 
HDDs [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -2.3 (-3.8,-0.9; p 0.002)  
TAC [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -11.0 g (-16.8, -5.1; p<0.001). 
In study 12023A: 
HDDs [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -1.7 (-3.1,-0.4; p 0.012)  
TAC [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -4.9 g (-10.6, 0.7; p 0.088). 
These  differences  in  treatment  effect  between  nalmefene  and  placebo  were  considered  by  the  CHMP 
small,  not  consistently  statistically  significant  across  co-primary  endpoints,  and  with  a  degree  of 
uncertainty with regards to clinical relevance in the total population.  
Interpretation  of  these  efficacy  results  observed  for  the  FAS  was  complicated  by  the  fact  that  a 
considerable  number  of  subjects  (18%  in  study  12014A,  33%  in  study  12023A)  almost  entirely 
finished drinking during the 1-2 week time period between screening and randomisation. In these pre-
random-reducers there was virtually no space for further improvement either by BRENDA interventions 
or IMP intake.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 50/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis  of  the  efficacy  results  was  further  complicated  by  the  issue  of  study  discontinuation  in  both 
pivotal trials: high levels of patient withdrawal were seen across both pivotal studies. The proportion of 
patients  who  withdrew  was  high  in  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool  (33.9%  in  the  placebo  group  and 
42.9%  in  the  nalmefene  group).  Withdrawal  of  consent  was  the  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  for 
13.3% of the patients in the placebo group and for 15.7% of the patients in the nalmefene group and 
was  the  most  common  primary  reason  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  high  withdrawal  rate  renders 
imputation  of  missing  data  an  important  issue  when  determining  statistical  significance  of  primary 
efficacy endpoints.  
To resolve the issues above, and in order to define a population where the benefit of Selincro would be 
greatest,  the  Applicant  proposed  to  focus  the  target  population  of  nalmefene  on  those  patients  with 
high or very high drinking risk level at baseline and randomisation. Therefore, they performed a post-
hoc subgroup analysis including patients with high or very high Drinking Risk Level (DRL) at baseline 
and who maintained a high or very high DRL at randomisation. 
-  In  study  12014A,  78.2%  of  patients  had  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline;  of  these,  75% 
(representing  58%  of  the  total  study  population)  continued  to  have  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at 
randomisation.  
-  In  study  12023A,  77.5%  of  patients  had  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline;  of  these,  59% 
(representing  46%  of  the  total  study  population)  continued  to  have  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at 
randomisation. 
In  this  subgroup  of  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  and  randomisation,  the  number  of  HDDs  was 
reduced from 22.6 per month at baseline to 10-11 per month after 24 weeks with a net difference over 
placebo of -3.7 (p 0.001, study 12014A) and -2.7 (p 0.025, study 12023A) HDDs per month (MMRM). 
TAC was reduced with a net difference over placebo of -18.3 g/day (p<0.001) in study 12014A and -
10.3 g/day (p 0.04) in study 12023A, after 24 weeks. In summary:  
In study 12014A: 
HDDs [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -3.7 (-5.9,-1.5; p<0.001) 
TAC [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -18.3 (-26.9, -9.7; p<0.001). 
In study 12023A: 
HDDs [MMRM, Diff (95%CI)]: -2.7 (-5.0,-0.3; p 0.025) 
TAC [MMRM, Diff (95%CI]: -10.3 (-20.2, -0.5; p 0.040). 
As  outlined  above,  the  net  treatment  effect  over  placebo  in  terms  of  HDD/TAC  reduction  and 
associated responder analyses was generally more pronounced in the subgroup of patients with high or 
very  high  DRL  at  baseline  and  randomisation  as  compared  to  the  total  population.  The  results  of  the 
secondary responder analyses (two-category downward shift in DRL, shift to low DRL, 70% reduction 
in TAC) supported those of the co-primary endpoints.  
However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  magnitude  of  the  beneficial  effects  was  still  inconsistent 
(varying depending on which analytical method between MMRM, LOCF, OC, PMI, MI or BOCF was used 
to measure it) and that its clinical relevance had not been fully elucidated. Therefore, questions were 
addressed to the Bio-Statistic Working Party (BSWP) on the appropriateness of the different sensitivity 
analyses  and  to  the  Psychiatry  SAG  Committee  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  treatment  effect 
achieved with nalmefene, as summarised below. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

Additional expert consultation 
To contribute to the elucidation of the above uncertainties, the Bio-Statistic Working Party (BSWP) was 
asked for its “view on the validity of the different analyses to provide a reliable estimate of the effect of 
treatment compared to placebo and baseline and the statistical evidence for the primary endpoints in 
the pivotal studies”.  
Additionally,  a  request  was  sent  to  the  psychiatry  SAG  to  comment  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the 
observed effect. The SAG expertise was also sought on the validity of the choice of reduction in alcohol 
consumption  rather  than  total  abstinence  as  a  therapeutic  goal.  Finally,  the  SAG  was  asked  to 
comment on the appropriateness of having defined a subgroup of patients that is more likely to benefit 
from nalmefene treatment as target population (i.e. patients with a high or very high DRL at baseline 
and randomisation) by means of a post-hoc analysis of the data. 
The contribution of each additional expert consultation is individually dealt with below. 
Bio-Statistic Working Party (BSWP) 
In  view  of  the  CHMP  requests  outlined  above,  the  Bio-Statistic  Working  Party  (BSWP)  was  asked  to 
address the following: 
Reduction  of  alcohol  consumption  was  measured  in  the  pivotal  studies  12014A  and  12023A  with  co-
primary  endpoints  as  change  from  baseline  in  monthly  number  of  Heavy  Drinking  Days  and  monthly 
Total  Alcohol  Consumption.  The  applicant  proposed  to  focus  on  a  target  population  of  those  patients 
with baseline high or very high drinking levels who were not reducing their alcohol consumption before 
randomisation. The treatment effect in this subgroup was more pronounced than in the ITT population. 
Because  a  considerable  number  of  missing  values  due  to  drop-outs  was  expected  and  observed,  a 
number  of  sensitivity  analyses  were  pre-specified  for  the  ITT  population  and  also  performed  in  the 
subpopulation.  The  validity  of  the  different  analyses  (MMRM  as  primary  analysis,  LOCF,  OC,  Placebo 
Mean  Imputation,  Placebo  Multiple  Imputation  and  BOCF  as  sensitivity  analyses)  to  provide  a  reliable 
estimate  of  the  effect  of  treatment  compared  to  placebo  and  baseline  and  the  statistical  evidence  for 
the primary endpoints in the pivotal studies was questioned. 
The BSWP provided a response document to the points raised by the CHMP, in which the advantages 
and disadvantages of each of the methodological analyses were discussed. The report explained that it 
is not possible to single out one of the six suggested methods as uniformly best. For the subgroup of 
patients  with  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  and  randomization  the  MI  analysis  would  suggest  an 
estimated  treatment  effect  of  a  reduction  of  about  2  heavy  drinking  days  per  month.  It  is  for  clinical 
experts to establish whether even these estimates could be considered to be of clinical relevance.  
The fact, however, that 48% of subjects withdrew from treatment in the nalmefene group before the 
end  of  the  study  in  study  12014A  shows  the  lack  of  robust  evidence  of  efficacy  at  6  months  for  all 
randomised patients. 
In the absence of an unequivocally preferred option (due to unverifiable assumptions) the assessment 
should still consider the pre-specified primary analyses but judge them in the light of the plausibility of 
the underlying assumption taking the lack of robustness due to the high and differential dropout rate 
into account. Analyses that had not been presented were: 
1.  A  comparison  of  responders;  with  a  defined  cut-off  point  of  clinical  relevance  (x)  for  the 
number of HDD per month.  For example, 
a.  patients with a decrease of ≥x HDD/month for any month in the follow-up period or 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 52/73 
 
 
 
 
b.  patients  who  completed  6-months  of  treatment  with  decrease  of  ≥x  HDD/month  in 
Month 6 
2.  A  ‘pattern-mixture’  model  (which  can  be  constructed  making  other  statistical  assumptions  on 
the unobserved data as MMRM and MI above).” 
In  the  light  of  the  above,  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  make  a  presentation  of  a  newly  calculated 
“pattern-mixture  model”,  constructed  making  other  statistical  assumptions  on  the  unobserved  data 
than the mixed model repeated measures MMRM and placebo multiple imputation MI, in the hope that 
this may help to further elucidate the effect size estimation. 
SAG 
In addition to the above, the CHMP requested to convene a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), to address 
the  questions  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  treatment  effect,  the  treatment  goal  (in 
particular,  whether  the  proposed  reduction  in  alcohol  consumption  rather  than  achievement  of 
abstinence and/or reduction in frequency and severity of relapse was a valid and desirable treatment 
goal of pharmacological intervention in alcohol-dependent patients and, if so, whether the primary care 
setting  would  be  appropriate)  and  the  target  population  (i.e.  those  patients  with  a  high  or  very  high 
DRL at baseline and who had maintained it at randomisation).  
The  key  outcome  of  the  Psychiatry  SAG  Meeting  is  summarized  hereof.  The  Group  noted  the  model 
presented  by  the  Applicant  showing  that  even  a  moderate  decrease  in  drinking  levels  might  be 
associated with a decrease in both harmful events (e.g. mortality rates; accidents) and a decrease in 
relative  risk  of  the  medical  issues  typically  linked  to  excessive  alcohol  drinking  (e.g.  liver  cirrhosis). 
The  SAG  confirmed  that,  however  modest,  the  effect  size  of  NMF  was  clinically  meaningful. 
Additionally,  the  SAG  recognised  the  validity  of  the  post-hoc  analysis  defining  the  target  population. 
Whilst it was acknowledged that post-hoc analyses are not ideal, it was stated that they are commonly 
used  in  clinical  trials  for  psychiatric  drugs,  given  the  high  dropout  rates  encountered  in  these 
populations.  The  SAG  also  acknowledged  that  the  reduction  in  alcohol  consumption  is  an  appropriate 
goal  in  a  subgroup  of  alcohol  dependent  patients  with  high  or  very  high  drinking  risk  level  (HDRL, 
VHDRL)  without  physiological  signs  of  withdrawal  and  not  requiring  any  immediate  detoxification 
procedure. To avoid misleading clinicians and to minimise off-label use, the group emphasized that the 
therapeutic  indications  should  clearly  instruct  physicians  (including  general  practitioners)  to  easily 
recognise the patients who could be the target of the drug.  
The  SAG  also  confirmed  that  the  study  population  is  representative  of  the  population  for  whom 
nalmefene is proposed to be prescribed. Based on the data provided, HDRL/VHDRL patients are more 
likely to be the target population who could benefit from nalmefene treatment. 
The  first  recommendation  of  the  BSWP,  definition  of  a  clear  cut-off  point  of  clinical  relevance  (x)  for 
the  number  of  HDD  per  month,  was  not  formally  addressed  by  SAG  experts.  However,  the  experts 
confirmed  that  the  effect  size  of  nalmefene  shown  in  pivotal  trials,  albeit  modest,  was  clinically 
relevant.  
Further to the above outcomes and requests of the BSWP and SAG, the Applicant made a presentation 
to  the  CHMP,  largely  focussed  on  statistical  content.  They  presented  on  the  therapeutic  effect  by 
illustrating  it  via  the  statistical  models  requested.  In  particular,  an  analysis  was  presented  based  on 
the “pattern mixture model” PMM selected by the BSWP to evaluate the impact of deviations from the 
underlying assumption behind the MMRM. By introducing different deltas, different patterns of alcohol 
consumption for withdrawn patients were explored.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

The  conclusions  from  the  applicant  presentation  were  that  both  responder  analyses  based  on  the 
number  of  heavy  drinking  days  (HDDs)  at  Month  6  confirmed  the  efficacy  of  nalmefene  and  were 
consistent with the results of the responder analyses based on total alcohol consumption (TAC).  
The PMM results based on the assumption of Δ = 2 for HDDs and Δ = 10 for TAC were considered by 
the  Applicant  unlikely  to  be  biased  in  favour  of  nalmefene,  with  an  estimated  treatment  effect 
compared  to  placebo  of  -2.7  (-4.8;  -0.6);  p=0.013  [Study  12014A]  and  -2.5  (-4.8;  -0.1);  p=0.040 
[Study 12023A] for HDDs and of -13.7 (-22.1; -5.2); p=0.001 [Study 12014A] and -9.3 (-19.4;  0.7); 
p=0.069 [Study 12023A] for TAC (g/day), i.e. approximately 2.5 HDDs/month and 10g/day in both 6-
month efficacy studies. 
Based  on  the  above  effect  size,  the  applicant  explained  why  in  their  view  the  observed  effect  was 
clinically  relevant,  using  direct  and  indirect  evidence,  addressing  various  CHMP  questions  and  the 
specific statistical methodology questions raised by the BSWP. 
In  particular,  as  the  BSWP  had  expressed  interest  in  the  treatment  effect at  the  end  of  the 6  month 
treatment  period,  the  applicant  focused  on  month  6  (end  of  treatment  period)  with  regards  to  the 
responder  analyses.  Clarifications  were  provided  on  the  primary  method  of  imputation  based on  the 
MMRM.  Based  on  the  available data  from  the  Applicant’s  studies,  for  withdrawn  patients,  the  alcohol 
consumption was stable up to time of withdrawal, and alcohol consumption after the last dose of IMP 
did not increase.  
After  the  Oral  Explanation  the  CHMP  discussed  the  possible  relevance  of  clinical  effect  of  a  reduction 
that  was  quantified  as  approximately  2  heavy  drinking  days  (HDD)  per  month.  The  SAG  view  on  the 
fact that, however modest, the effect size of nalmefene was to be considered clinically meaningful was 
noted. Concern was expressed on the possible occurrence of withdrawal symptoms and how to identify 
those  patients  with  withdrawal  symptoms  in  order  to  exclude  them  from  taking  Selincro.  The  CHMP 
recommended  that  the  product  information  for  Selincro  would  not  include  reference  to  any 
assumptions, but only responders’ analysis with withdrawals imputed as failures (non-responders).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall effect size 
In the adjusted target population as defined above (patients with high or very high DRL at baseline and 
who  maintained  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  randomisation)  a  more  than  50%  reduction  of  drinking 
amounts in terms of HDD and TAC was achieved by the combined use of as-needed active treatment 
administration  and  accompanying  BRENDA  interventions.  The  mean  number  of  heavy  drinking  days 
(HDDs) decreased from 23 days/month at baseline to 11 days/month at Month 6 in Study 12014A and 
from 23 days/month to 10 days/month in Study 12023A. The mean TAC decreased from 102 g/day at 
baseline to 44 g/day at Month 6 in Study 12014A, and from 113 g/day to 43 g/day in Study 12023A. 
This reduction corresponds to approximately 160 additional days per year with no heavy drinking and 
to the equivalent of 330 fewer bottles of wine consumed per year. 
Robustness of the net effect over placebo 
In  the  primary  analysis  (based  on  MMRM),  the  difference  in  the  reduction  of  alcohol  consumption 
between  nalmefene  and  placebo  ranged  from  2.7  HDDs/month  to  3.7  HDDs/month  and  from 
approximately 10g/day to approximately 18g/day. This translates into approximately 1⅓ months fewer 
HDDs per year and almost 80 bottles of wine fewer per year with nalmefene compared to placebo.

The proportion of patients who withdrew in the Applicant-sponsored studies was comparable to that in 
other  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  AD  over  the  last  10  years  (e.g. 
Combine  study  2006,  Anton  et  al.).  In  Study  12014A,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  was 
higher  in  the  nalmefene  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (NMF  48%,  PBO  26%).  In  the  identical 
second  6-month  study,  Study  12023A,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  was  similar  in  both 
treatment groups (NMF 36%, PBO 30%). Various sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate how 
different assumptions would influence the estimates of the treatment effect versus placebo.  
All the sensitivity analyses were in favour of nalmefene, irrespective of the imputation method.  
The  CHMP  recommended  the  following  wording  for  SmPC  section  4.1  as  the  one  that  would  most 
accurately  reflect  the  pivotal  trial  data  and  specify  the  target  population  and  prescribing  conditions 
most appropriate for nalmefene treatment: 
Selincro is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence 
who have a high drinking risk level (see section 5.1), without physical withdrawal symptoms and who 
do not require immediate detoxification. 
Selincro  should  only  be  prescribed  in  conjunction  with  continuous  psychosocial  support  focussed  on 
treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption. 
Selincro should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high drinking risk level two weeks 
after initial assessment. 
This  indication  wording  needs  to  be  seen  in  conjunction  with  the  wording  in  section  4.2,  in  particular 
with regards to monitoring instructions and duration of treatment.  
Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  has  also  carefully  been  worded  in  order  to  accurately  reflect  clinical  data  in 
the efficacy pivotal trials. No reference to assumptions is made, but only the responders’ analysis with 
withdrawals imputed as failures (non-responders) has been included. Results at month 6 are stated for 
‘completers’ (those patients who had maintained a high or very high DRL at randomisation, continued 
treatment and completed the study). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Due  to  almost  identical  design  and  patient  inclusion  criteria,  the  three  Lundbeck  studies  12014A, 
12023A and 12013A were summarized as the Alcohol Dependence Pool.  
The  Alcohol-use  Disorders  Pool  comprises  the  patients  from  the  placebo  and  NMF  groups  of  the  five 
phase  II/III  studies  CPH-101-0801,  CPH-101-0701,  CPH-101-0299,  CPH-101-0399,  and  CPH-101-
0400, conducted by the former licensee Biotie. 
Patient exposure 
The  All-patients-being-treated  Set  (APTS)  in  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool  comprised  1941  patients 
who either had recorded IMP intake or did not return all their IMP: 797 in the placebo group and 1144 
in the nalmefene group. 
In the Alcohol-use Disorders Pool a total of 361 patients in the placebo group and 689 patients in the 
nalmefene groups were included. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 55/73 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Overall, in the Alcohol Dependence Poll the IMP was taken on 62.1% of days in the placebo group, and 
on 50.8% of days in the NMF group. 
Withdrawal 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  was  high  in  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool  (33.9%  in  the 
placebo group and 42.9% in the nalmefene group). Withdrawal of consent was the primary reason for 
withdrawal  for  13.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  for  15.7%  of  the  patients  in  the 
nalmefene  group  and  was  the  most  common  primary  reason  in  both  treatment  groups. 
For 3.8% of the patients in the placebo group and 10.5% of the patients in the nalmefene group, the 
primary reason for withdrawal was adverse events. 
Adverse events  
TEAEs (Alcohol Dependence Pool) 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  rather  high  both  for  placebo  (in  500/797=62.7%  of  patients)  and  for 
nalmefene  (in  855/1144=74.7%  of  patients).  Unspecific  TEAEs  like  dizziness,  nausea,  headache  and 
insomnia prevail. Dizziness, nausea and insomnia/sleep disorders occurred about 3-4 times more often 
in subjects receiving NMF. 
More than ten percent of subjects receiving nalmefene experienced severe related TEAEs like dizziness, 
nausea, insomnia, or vomiting. 
The incidence of TEAEs was not dependent upon the Drinking Risk Level at baseline. TEAEs occurred in 
74.7% of NMF patients (placebo 62.7%) of the entire Alcohol Dependence Pool, 74.8% of NMF patients 
(placebo 62.3%) with high or very high DRL and 75.8% of NMF patients (placebo 64.4%) with medium 
DRL. 
Comparison of pools 
The  most  frequently  observed  TEAEs  of  nalmefene  are  very  similar  for  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool 
and  the  Alcohol-use  Disorder  Pool.  In  the  Alcohol-use  Disorder  Pool,  subjects  were  included  that 
received different nalmefene doses (5, 10, 20, 40 mg). However, there was no clear dose-relationship 
in the types or incidences of adverse events among dose groups. 
Onset and duration of TEAEs leading to withdrawal 
TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  in  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool  occurred  much  earlier  in  subjects 
receiving  NMF  (median  7  days)  than  in  subjects  receiving  placebo  (median  63  days).  After  onset, 
TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  lasted  considerably  shorter  in  the  NMF  group  (5  days)  as  compared  to 
placebo (47 days), until the decision for withdrawal due to AE was taken. 
Time course of frequent TEAEs 
The  frequent  TEAEs  nausea  [dizziness]  mostly  occurred  within  the  first  month  of  treatment  with  an 
incidence  of  18.1%  [15.7%].  Thereafter  the  incidence  decreases  dramatically  to  about  1-2%  per 
month. Despite the short median duration of nausea and dizziness (3 days each) it appears to prevail 
for  considerable  time  in  some  patients,  since  the  rate  of  ongoing  nausea  /  dizziness  outnumbers  the 
incidence rates from month 2-13. 
Insomnia / sleep-related events 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 56/73 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of insomnia was 5.4% in the placebo group and 13% in the nalmefene group. A 
total of 0.3% of the patients in the placebo group and 0.9% of the patients in the nalmefene group had 
insomnia that led to withdrawal.  
Sleep-related events (insomnia, somnolence, nightmares, fatigue, etc.) were frequently observed with 
29.3% of subjects receiving nalmefene reporting either night- or day-time events. In overall 4.9% of 
subjects  symptoms  occurred  both  at  night-  and  day-time.  Insomnia  is  listed  as  a  very  commonly 
occurring AE and sleep disorders as a commonly adverse event in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.  
Hepatic function disorders 
Hepatic disorders, either potentially drug-related or specifically reported as alcohol-related, occurred at 
similar  frequencies  in  the  nalmefene  and  the  placebo  group.  There  were  four  cases  of  alcoholic  liver 
disease  in  the  nalmefene  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group.  Overall,  the  differentiation  between 
potentially  drug-related  and  specifically  alcohol-related  hepatic  disorders  is  difficult  to  make. 
It  is  concluded  that  nalmefene  does  not  additionally  compromise  hepatic  function.  Increases  in  liver 
enzymes  like  ALAT,  AST  and  GGT  were  similar  in  both  groups.  The  incidences  of  other  potential 
indicators  of 
liver 
function  disorders, 
like  INR 
increased,  prolonged  prothrombin  time  or 
hypoalbuminaemia were < 0.2% for nalmefene. 
Selected psychiatric events 
Psychiatric  disorders  such  as  confusion,  abnormal  thinking,  and  hallucination  occurred  in  2.9%  of 
subjects  receiving  nalmefene,  i.e.  about  three  times  more  often  than  in  the  placebo  group.  In  seven 
cases,  confusion  /  delusion  /  hallucination  was  rated  as  severe.  In  studies  included  in  the  Alcohol 
Dependence Pool subjects with existing psychiatric co-morbidities were not included. Confusional state 
and hallucination are listed as psychiatric disorders in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
AEs potentially related to suicidality 
Two patients in the placebo group committed suicide.  
In  the  nalmefene  group,  there  were  two  cases  of  self  harm  /  suicidal  behaviour  after  long-standing 
regular nalmefene intake. The majority of adverse events potentially related to suicidality (7/9) regard 
cases  of  intentional  overdose,  not  necessarily  with  suicidal  intention,  but  in  an  attempt  to  increase 
efficacy. In the majority of these cases, two tablets were taken. 
Latent  suicidality  of  the  patient  has  to  be  borne  in  mind  by  the  treating  physician  when  dealing  with 
alcohol  dependent  patients.  Overall,  it  is  concluded  that  in  the  available  clinical  trial  database  (incl. 
Alcohol Dependence Pool and Alcohol-use Disorder Pool) there was no signal for nalmefene pointing to 
increased suicidality of the patients.  
Adverse events of special interest (others) 
Depressive  symptoms  (encompassing  depressed  mood,  anhedonia,  dysphoria,  depression  etc.)  were 
reported in 37/1144 patients in the nalmefene group (3.2%) and 22/797 patients in the placebo group 
(2.8%). 
Based  on  the  available  database,  nalmefene  does  not  appear  to  raise  the  incidence  of  accidents  and 
falls in the target population of alcohol dependent patients.  
Convulsions  (SMQ),  encompassing  alcohol  seizure,  convulsion  and  epilepsy,  occurred  in  only  5  out  of 
1144  patients receiving nalmefene (0.4%) [placebo group: 4 out of 797 patients (0.5%)]. At least in 
three  of  the  five  cases  a  causal  relationship  with  nalmefene  is  unlikely,  since  convulsions  occurred 
more than three weeks after the most recent dose.  
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 57/73 
 
 
 
 
In the clinical trails, nalmefene was not liable to drug abuse or dependence. 
Role of alcohol intake on TEAE occurrence 
The overall rate of patients with TEAEs within 1 day after first dose of IMP was 40.0% in NMF patients 
without  alcohol  and  41.3%  in  NMF  patients  with  alcohol  intake.  Apart  from  similarity  of  the  overall 
incidence rate of TEAEs there was also no striking difference for single AEs of particular interest (NMF 
group TEAE rate without / with alcohol: nausea 12.7 vs 15.1%, fatigue 4.2 vs 5.1%, dizziness 14.8 vs 
13.5%, headache 5.5 vs 5.1%, abnormal dreams 0.3 vs 0.4%, anxiety 1.8 vs 1.6%, insomnia 5.8 vs 
6.2%, hyperhidrosis 4.5 vs 2.4%). 
It therefore appears that TEAEs were mostly related to the intake of nalmefene itself, rather than the 
combination of nalmefene with alcohol. The feeling of malaise which deters the patients from drinking 
occurs  for  disulfiram  only  when  alcohol  is  actually  consumed.  Nalmefene  may  deter  patients  from 
drinking by causing unspecific symptoms like nausea, dizziness etc. before alcohol is actually taken. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  high  after  nalmefene  administration  (74.7%).  Additionally,  study 
discontinuation due to intolerable AEs was high (10.5%), and may still be underestimated since for a 
number  of  patients  discontinuing  for  consent  withdrawal,  the  occurrence  of  AEs  may  play  a 
contributory  role.  TEAEs  mainly  occurred  early  at  treatment  initiation.  In  the  further  course  of 
treatment tolerability improves. Mostly, TEAEs were rather unspecific like nausea or dizziness. Notably, 
many patients reported sleep-related events (either at day- or night-time).  
Nalmefene  did  not  appear  to  additionally  compromise  hepatic  function  on  top  of  alcohol-related  liver 
enzyme increases. 
A  study  investigating  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  nalmefene  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment 
(mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  and  in  healthy  subjects  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
Occurrence of TEAEs was mostly related to the intake of nalmefene itself, rather than the combination 
of  nalmefene  with  alcohol.  However,  nalmefene  may  also  deter  patients  from  drinking  by  causing 
unspecific symptoms like nausea, dizziness etc. before alcohol is actually taken. 
From the safety database, all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics, which also includes warnings on use in patients with concomitant 
psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, there were no serious adverse events causing major safety concern.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  applicant  has  provided  documents  that  set  out  a  detailed  description  of  the  Lundbeck  system  of 
pharmacovigilance  (Version  12.0  dated  June  2012).  A  statement  signed  by  the  applicant  and  the 
qualified  person  for  pharmacovigilance,  indicating  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified 
person responsible for pharmacovigilance and the necessary means for the notification of any adverse 
reaction occurring either in the Community or in a third country has been provided.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements  as  described  in  Volume  9A  of  the  Rules  Governing  Medicinal  Products  in  the  European 
Union  and  provided  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
Risk Management Plan 
The  Applicant  submitted  an  EU  Risk  Management  Plan  (EU-RMP)  “RMP-EU-2012”  –  Version  1.0.  The 
Data  Lock  Point  of  the  EU-RMP  was  1  May,  2012.  According  to  Volume  9A  of  The  Rules  Governing 
Medicinal Products in the European Union – Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use – an EU-RMP should be submitted with the application for a new active substance as well 
as for a new dosage form, new route of administration and significantly differing therapeutic indication 
of a known active substance. Nalmefene has been marketed outside the EU (e.g. USA, Canada, China, 
and  Mexico)  as  solution  for  injection  only,  in  the  treatment  of  opioid  overdose  and  reversal  of  opioid 
drug  effects.  No  oral  dosage  forms  have  been  approved  worldwide.  Therefore,  an  EU-RMP  is 
mandatory. 
Safety Specification 
The important identified risks, important potential risks and important missing information as outlined 
in the Safety Specification Summary of the submitted EU-RMP are listed in the following table. 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report

Pharmacovigilance plan 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Applicant  has  standard  practices  for  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities 
involving  spontaneous  post-marketing  adverse  event  reports,  serious  adverse  events  from  clinical 
studies,  pregnancy  exposures,  lactation  exposures,  overdoses  and  medication  errors.  Routine 
pharmacovigilance  includes  systems  and  processes  to  ensure  that  information  about  all  suspected 
adverse  reactions  reported  to  the  company  is  collected,  the  preparation  of  reports  for  regulatory 
authorities is made, and continuous monitoring of the safety profile of approved products is performed 
as described in Pharmacovigilance System. 
All  the  safety  concerns  described  in  the  safety  specification  will  be  adequately  addressed  by  the 
standard  pharmacovigilance  activities  as  described  above  and 
the 
following  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities: 
a.  A  non-interventional,  multi-country,  prospective  cohort  study  (drug  utilisation  study)  will  provide 
data related to the patterns of use and of the frequency of selected adverse events in the overall 
treated population and in sub-populations in routine clinical practice.  
b.  The  drug  utilisation  study  described  above  will  be  complemented  by  a  parallel  study,  which  will 
investigate  the  pattern  of  use  of  nalmefene  in  Europe  by  means  of  retrospective  databases 
analyses. 
c.  An  interventional,  single-site,  open-label,  four-group,  single-dose  study  investigating  the 
pharmacokinetic  properties  of  nalmefene  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment  (mild,  moderate,  or 
severe) and in healthy subjects (to determine the AUC0-inf of nalmefene and the main metabolite 
nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide following a single oral dose of 18 mg nalmefene in subjects with mild, 
moderate, or severe renal impairment and compare to that in healthy subjects). 
Evaluation of the need for a risk minimisation plan 
All the safety concerns described in the safety specification will be adequately addressed by routine 
risk minimisation. There is currently no additional risk minimisation activities planned. 
Risk minimisation plan 
Routine risk minimisation plan is summarised in the table below.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
An overall reduction from baseline of drinking amounts was noted within the clinical trial setting. The 
baseline number of HDDs of 19.3 per month was reduced by about 11-12 days in the NMF group in the 
overall  population.  Equally,  Total  alcohol  consumption  (87.7  g/d  at  baseline)  was  reduced  by  about 
50g. 
The  results  for  the  secondary  responder  analysis  are  concordant  with  the  results  for  the  co-primary 
reduction of HDD and TAC. Following the MMRM approach, odds ratios for showing 30%, 50% or 70% 
reduction  in  TAC  after  24  weeks  of  treatment  were  significantly  favourable  to  NMF  as  compared  to 
placebo  in  the  pooled  FAS.  86.1%  of  subjects  receiving  NMF  reduced  alcohol  consumption  by  30% 
(70.9%  of  subjects  achieved  50%  reduction,  46.8%  reduced  drinking  by  70%).  However,  placebo 
response was high and consistent. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a  high  or  very  high  DRL  at  baseline  and  randomisation  (50%  of  the 
total  population)  the  treatment  effect  in  terms  of  HDD/TAC  reduction  and  associated  responder 
analyses  was  more  pronounced  (HDDs  [MMRM,  Diff  (95%CI;  p)],  study  12014A:  -3.7  (-5.9,-1.5; 
<0.001), study 12023A: -2.7 (-5.0,-0.3; 0.025) (TAC [MMRM, Diff (95%CI; p] study 12014A: -18.3 (-
26.9, -9.7; <0.001), study 12023A: -10.3 (-20.2, -0.5; 0.040). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the total population, the difference in treatment effect between nalmefene and placebo (equivalent 
to  BRENDA  only) was  small,  not  consistently  statistically  significant  across  co-primary  endpoints,  and 
of  questionable  clinical  relevance  (HDDs  [MMRM,  Diff  (95%CI;  p)],  study  12014A:  -2.3  (-3.8,-0.9; 
0.002),  study  12023A:  -1.7  (-3.1,-0.4;  0.012)  (TAC  [MMRM,  Diff  (95%CI;  p],  study  12014A:  -11.0  
(-16.8, -5.1; <0.01), study 12023A: -4.9 (-10.6, 0.7; 0.088). 
The positive tendency and the order of magnitude of parameters showing persistence of the treatment 
effect  over  13  months  (reduction  of  drinking  days  despite  IMP  intake,  increase  of  study  adherence, 
reduction  of  days  with  no  IMP  Intake  and  drinking,  and  increasing  portion  of  abstinent  days  with  no 
IMP  intake)  was  similar  in  patients  receiving  placebo.  The  favourable  development  (both  for  placebo 
and NMF) may be explained by the increasing accumulation of study completers (mostly responders) in 
the course of the 13 months.  
The  proportion  of  patients  who  withdrew  was  high  in  the  Alcohol  Dependence  Pool  (33.9%  in  the 
placebo group and 42.9% in the nalmefene group). Withdrawal of consent was the primary reason for 
withdrawal  for  13.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  for  15.7%  of  the  patients  in  the 
nalmefene group and was the most common primary reason in both treatment groups. 
For 3.8% of the patients in the placebo group and 10.5% of the patients in the nalmefene group, the 
primary reason for withdrawal was adverse events.  
The  high  withdrawal  rate  renders  imputation  of  missing  data  an  important  issue  when  determining 
statistical  significance  of  primary  efficacy  endpoints.  This  was  tried  to  resolve  by  sensitivity  analyses 
applying  various  imputation  methods  (MMRM,  PMI,  LOCF,  BOCF  etc).  Whereas  most  sensitivity 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 68/73 
 
 
 
 
 
analyses  confirmed  the  primary  analysis,  a  treatment  effect  of  verum  vs.  placebo  was  absent  in  the 
BOCF analysis. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  high  after  nalmefene  administration  (74.7%).  Additionally,  study 
discontinuation due to intolerable AEs was high (10.5%), and may still be underestimated, since for a 
number  of  patients  discontinuing  for  consent  withdrawal  the  occurrence  of  AEs  may  well  play  a 
contributory  role.  TEAEs  mainly  occurred  early  at  treatment  initiation.  In  the  further  course  of 
treatment  tolerability  improves.  Mostly,  TEAEs  were  rather  unspecific  like  nausea  or  dizziness.  Many 
patients  reported  sleep-related  events  (either  at  day-  or  night-time).  However,  apart  from  actual 
substance-related  effects  on  sleep,  the  reduction  of  alcohol  amounts  is  also  thought  to  interfere  with 
sleep as a sign of mild withdrawal at treatment initiation. 
Nalmefene  did  not  appear  to  additionally  compromise  hepatic  function  on  top  of  alcohol-related  liver 
enzyme increases. 
Occurrence of TEAEs was mostly related to the intake of nalmefene itself, rather than the combination 
of  nalmefene  with  alcohol.  However,  nalmefene  may  also  deter  patients  from  drinking  by  causing 
unspecific symptoms like nausea, dizziness etc. before alcohol is actually taken. 
Overall, there were no serious adverse events causing major safety concern. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  influence  of  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  nalmefene  after  oral 
administration of 18 mg doses was not fully elucidated. Data on the use of nalmefene in patients with 
severe  hepatic  impairment  are  missing.  Selincro  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  renal  or 
severe hepatic impairment. 
Based  on  the  available  data,  differentiated  dose  recommendations  or  warning  notes  for  various 
degrees of renal or hepatic impairment could not be formulated.  This is reflected in Sections 4.2 of the 
SmPC.  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  states  that  caution  should  be  exercised  when  prescribing  Selincro  to 
patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  or  mild  or  moderate  renal  impairment,  for  example,  by  more 
frequent monitoring. 
A  study  investigating  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  nalmefene  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment 
(mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  and  in  healthy  subjects  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
Selincro  has  not  been  investigated  in  patients  with  unstable  psychiatric  disease.  The  SmPC 
reccommends caution if Selincro is prescribed to patients with current psychiatric comorbidity such as 
major depressive disorder. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Interpretation of efficacy results observed for the Full Analysis Set was complicated by the fact that a 
considerable  number  of  subjects  almost  entirely  finished  drinking  during  the  1-2  week  time  period 
Selincro 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 69/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between screening and randomisation. In these pre-random-reducers there was virtually no space for 
further improvement either by BRENDA interventions or IMP intake.  
A  post-hoc  analysis  identified  the  population  in  which  the  efficacy  of  nalmefene  was  demonstrated:  
those patients with high or very high drinking risk level (DRL) at baseline and maintained this risk level 
at  randomisation.  To  reflect  this,  the  indications  specify  that  Selincro  should  be  initiated  only  in 
patients who continue to have a high DRL two weeks after initial assessment. 
In this subgroup, identified as most likely to benefit, the net treatment effect over placebo in terms of 
Heavy Drinking Day (HDD) reduction was more pronounced.  
Overall, there were no serious adverse events causing major safety concern. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  overall  B/R  of  nalmefene  18  mg  tablets  (Selincro)  is  positive,  given  the  demonstrated  clinical 
benefit  in  the  defined  subgroup  of  target  population  and  taking  into  account  that  particular  safety 
concerns were not raised over the 1-year treatment period. 
The  CHMP  recommended  the  following  wording  for  SmPC  section  4.1  as  the  one  that  would  most 
accurately  reflect  the  pivotal  trial  data  and  specify  the  target  population  and  prescribing  conditions 
most appropriate for nalmefene treatment: 
Selincro is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence 
who have a high drinking risk level (see section 5.1), without physical withdrawal symptoms and who 
do not require immediate detoxification. 
Selincro  should  only  be  prescribed  in  conjunction  with  continuous  psychosocial  support  focussed  on 
treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption. 
Selincro should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high drinking risk level two weeks 
after initial assessment. 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority 
decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Selincro  in  the  treatment  of  the  reduction  of  alcohol 
consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level (see section 
5.1),  without  physical  withdrawal  symptoms  and  who  do  not  require  immediate  detoxification  is 
favourable  and  therefore  recommends    the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the 
following conditions:

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit 
periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of 
Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required    pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the  
agreed  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  agreeed    subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP shall be submitted annually until renewal. 
When  the  submission  of  a  PSUR  and  the  update  of  a  RMP  coincide,  they  should  be  submitted  at  the 
same time. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  the  quality  properties  of  the  active  substance,  the  CHMP 
considers that nalmefene is qualified as a new active substance. 
Nalmefene  hydrochloride dihydrate  is structurally  related  to  Naltrexone  hydrochloride  which  has  been 
already authorized in the EU. Naltrexone (base) but not the approved Naltrexone hydrochloride is used 
as  a  precursor  during  the  synthesis  of  Nalmefene  hydrochloride  dihydrate.  Naltrexone  (base)  is 
transformed into Nalmefene (base) by a formal substitution of a carbonyl group's oxygen (R1R2C=O) 
with  a  methylene  functionality  (R1R2C=CH2)  which  leads  to  a  substantial  change  in  molecular 
structure  and  to  a  significant  modification  of  chemical  as  well  as  physico-chemical  properties.  As  a 
consequence  of  these  attributes  different  pharmacokinetic,  pharmacodynamic  and  toxicological 
properties  have  to  be  expected.  Therefore,  Nalmefene  hydrochloride  dihydrate  can  not  be  considered 
as a derivative of an authorized substance.

Divergent position 
In the two pivotal studies supporting the indication the treatment effect is modest. The difference in 
treatment effect between nalmefene and placebo (equivalent to BRENDA only) is not consistently 
statistically significant across co-primary endpoints, and of questionable clinical relevance in the total 
population.  
In this pivotal studies 12014A and 12023A, 18%, and 33%, of the patients, respectively, considerably 
reduced their alcohol consumption in the period between screening and randomisation. Therefore, the 
patients who maintained a high or very high DRL at randomisation were defined post-hoc as the target 
population. 
In the post-hoc subgroup of patients with a high or very high DRL at baseline and randomisation (50% 
of the total population)’ the treatment effect in terms of HDD/TAC reduction and associated responder 
analyses was slightly higher but still modest.   
Due to the high number of withdrawals a number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. The reduction 
in alcohol consumption in terms of reduction in HDDs and TAC was inconsistent across the various 
sensitivity analyses. The Biostatistics Working Party concluded that multiple imputation (MI) analysis is 
the most relevant analysis to answer this question but the robustness of treatment effect is not 
supported by this sensitivity analysis. 
There was an inconsistent response across both studies in terms of the clinically relevant 
improvements in liver biomarkers and health-related quality-of-life scale scores. 
There is no direct evidence of harm reduction. The applicant provided modelling of epidemiological 
data. However, during CHMP discussions the assumptions upon which these studies and modellings 
were based were not unanimously supported. 
The treatment effect observed in the pivotal studies translates into approximately 2 fewer HDDs per 
month and 1-2 drinks fewer per day for patients treated with nalmefene compared to those who 
received placebo (MMRM analysis). The majority of participants continued to have significant levels of 
HDDs and daily levels of consumption of alcohol. The clinical significance of this modest reduction in 
alcohol consumption has not been demonstrated in these studies.

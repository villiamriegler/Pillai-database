I. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
Non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  accounts  for  approximately  85%  of  all  cases  of  lung  cancer. 
Although there has been a gradual decrease in the incidence of NSCLC in men, it continues to increase 
in  women.  The  treatment  of  NSCLC  is  determined  by  disease  stage.  Surgery  continues  to  be  the 
mainstay  of  treatment  for  early-stage  and  localised  disease.  Approximately  40%  of  patients  with 
NSCLC present at an advanced stage, including patients with metastatic disease and those with locally 
advanced disease with malignant pleural or pericardial effusion. 
The  primary  goals  of  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced  and  metastatic  disease  are  palliative  in 
essence,  aiming  at  providing  relief  from  symptoms  and  enhancing  PFS  and,  if  possible,  survival. 
Platinum-based  chemotherapy,  when  given  as  first-line  therapy,  modestly  prolonged  survival 
compared with best supportive care. The current standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced 
NSCLC consists of a platinum compound (cisplatin or carboplatin) combined with one of the newer 
chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, vinorelbine and irinotecan). 
All the platinum-containing chemotherapies have similar efficacy.  
Currently,  bevacizumab,  in  addition  to  platinum-based  chemotherapy,  is  indicated  for  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable  advanced,  metastatic  or  recurrent  NSCLC  other  than 
predominantly  squamous  cell  histology.  Bevacizumab  is  administered  in  addition  to  the  platinum-
based  chemotherapy  for  up  to  6  treatment  cycles  after  which  bevacizumab  is  given  as  single  agent 
maintenance therapy until disease progression. Furthermore, pemetrexed recently received a positive 
opinion from CHMP as single-agent maintenance therapy for patients with advanced, non-squamous 
NSCLC. The approval was based on a placebo-controlled phase III trial demonstrating a statistically 
significant difference in terms of the primary endpoint Progression Free Survival (PFS).  The median 
PFS was 4.3 months in the pemetrexed group versus 2.6 months in the placebo group. In a secondary 
analysis  of  the  independently  assessed  PFS,  the  observed  median  PFS  was  4.04  months  for  the 
pemetrexed arm and 1.97 month for the placebo arm. The observed effect on PFS was supported by 
analysis of the secondary endpoint which was overall survival (OS), with median OS of 13.4 months 
associated to pemetrexed compared to 10.6 months for the placebo group. In a subgroup analysis in 
patients  with  non-squamous  histology,  the  observed  median  OS  with  pemetrexed  was  15.5  months 
versus 10.3 months in the placebo arm.   
Tarceva  (erlotinib)  is  an  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor/human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor 
type  1  (EGFR  also  known  as  HER1)  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI).  Erlotinib  potently  inhibits  the 
intracellular  phosphorylation  of  EGFR.  EGFR  is  expressed  on  the  cell  surface  of  normal  cells  and 
cancer cells. In non clinical models, inhibition of EGFR phosphotyrosine results in cell stasis and/or 
death. 
In  vitro  testing  of  erlotinib  demonstrated  a  highly  specific  and  potent  inhibition  of  EGFR  (IC50  = 
2 nM). Subsequent in vivo experiments revealed EGFR inhibition in human tumour xenograft efficacy 
models, adequate bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. There were no serious toxicity issues 
that precluded its use as an antineoplastic agent.  
Phase  I  studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  cancer  patients  assessed  the  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of 
erlotinib at various dose levels and helped identify an appropriate dose (150 mg daily) for evaluation 
of antitumour activity in subsequent studies. Phase II studies of single-agent erlotinib in the treatment 
of advanced solid tumours other than NSCLC suggested antitumour activity in head and neck, ovarian, 
colorectal cancers, glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
In a Phase II study in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who had progressed despite platinum-based 
chemotherapy  (Study  A248-1007),  a  12.3%  objective  response  rate  and  a  median  overall  OS  of  8.4 
months was demonstrated. These results compared favourably with data for chemotherapy (docetaxel) 
used in second-line therapy, as well as emerging data with similar EGFR agents. 
BR.21  was  subsequently  initiated  in  collaboration  with  the  National  Cancer  Institute  of  Canada 
Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG). This study was conducted as a global, randomised , double-blind, 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo-controlled  study  comparing  erlotinib  to  best  supportive  care  in  patients  with  Stage  IIIb/IV 
NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  1  prior  chemotherapy  regimen.  In  BR.21,  the  use  of  erlotinib 
monotherapy  in  a  second-  and  third-line  setting  was  shown  to  provide  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically meaningful prolongation of OS (HR=0.73, p=0.001, N=731) and PFS (HR=0.64, p< 0.001) 
in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC.  This  pivotal  study  led  to  the  initial  approval  of  erlotinib  for  the 
treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC after failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.  
Use of erlotinib was also later extended to pancreatic cancer based on study PA.3 in combination with 
gemcitabine.   
Based on the results of BR.21, it was also considered that the pro-apoptotic effects of erlotinib could 
be beneficial when trying to enhance the anti-tumour effects of chemotherapy.  A preclinical study in 
the NSCLC cell line Calu1 showed that sequential administration of a chemotherapy agent (docetaxel) 
followed by erlotinib resulted in a greater level of apoptosis compared with docetaxel alone. Although 
there was no significant difference in OS for erlotinib administered concomitantly with chemotherapy 
in the first-line setting in the TALENT and TRIBUTE studies, further exploratory analysis of the data 
from these studies showed that patients treated with erlotinib for more than 150 days (i.e., beyond the 
initial  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy)  showed  increased  response  duration  compared  with  placebo 
(Gatzemeier, 2007 Herbst, 2005). These data suggested a possible benefit of single-agent erlotinib as a 
first-line maintenance therapy following chemotherapy as treatment for advanced NSCLC. 
Study BO18192 (SATURN) was therefore designed as a Phase III, multicentre, randomised , double-
blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of erlotinib or placebo following 4 cycles of 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who had not experienced disease 
progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity  during  chemotherapy.  To  investigate  whether  benefit  was 
observed  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  over  expressing  the  target  receptor  EGFR,  the  study  also 
assessed benefit in this subpopulation as a co-primary endpoint. 
Tarceva was first approved in the EU on 19 September 2005 for the treatment of patients with locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  one  prior  chemotherapy  regimen  and  also  in 
combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Tarceva to 
include: 
Tarceva is indicated as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based 
first-line chemotherapy. 
1.1 
Non-Clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
With this application, the MAH submitted an expert report addressing the ERA for erlotinib. 
No  significant  risk  to  sewage  treatment  plants,  surface  waters  and  groundwater  has  been  identified 
from the use of erlotinib. Final conclusions concerning the effects of erlotinib on sediment organisms 
will be provided as a post-authorisation commitment. 
1.2 
Clinical aspects 
1.2.1   GCP aspects/ Scientific Advice 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  primary  study  in  this  application,  BO18192,  was  conducted  in  accordance 
with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the 
principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  (as  amended  in  Tokyo,  Venice,  Hong  Kong  and  South 
Africa), and the local laws and regulations of the countries in which the research was conducted.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  formal  scientific  advice  was  given  by  the  CHMP  for  the  indication  “maintenance therapy  in 
patients with locally advanced or  metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer  who have not progressed on 
first-line chemotherapy”. 
1.2.2  Clinical pharmacology 
In this application additional pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
information  derived  from  Study  BO18192,  conducted  in  patients  with  stage  IIIb  or  IV  NSCLC 
following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is presented (see Main Study). 
The objectives of the current PK/PD analysis was to investigate the PK of erlotinib in NSCLC patients 
and  furthermore  to  explore  the  potential  relationship  between  exposure  to  erlotinib  and  measures  of 
safety and efficacy.  
Pharmacokinetics 
In study BO18192 plasma samples were collected on all randomised patients. All patients entering in 
the study were to have five PK samples taken as follows: 
• Baseline visit (Day 1 of the study): one sample was taken before the first dose of study medication 
was administered. 
• Visit week 6: one pre-dose sample, one post-dose sample (time window between 3-5 hours). 
• Visit week 12: one pre-dose sample, one post-dose sample (time window between 3-5 hours). 
It  should  be  noted,  that  the  nature  of  this  PK/PD  dataset  necessitated  to  disregard  all  patients  who 
discontinued the study before week 6. 
A total number of 308 patients were eligible for this PK/PD analysis. They were treated with erlotinib 
and  had  at  least  one  measurable  plasma  concentration  post  dose.  A  total  number  of  882  plasma 
samples  with  measurable  erlotinib  concentrations  were  collected.  From  these  308  patients,  15  had 
measurable  plasma  concentrations  at  the  baseline  visit  (before  any  drug  intake),  and  2  patients  had 
implausible high plasma concentrations without any or long after any documented drug intake. These 
unexpected values were considered to be due to normal sampling or data recording errors. Therefore, 
these  17  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Data  from  291  patients  were  available  for  the 
PK/PD analysis.  
The  final  model  included  the  effects  of  smoking  habit  (SMOK),  gender  (GDR),  alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein  (AAG),  albumin  (ALBU),  bilirubin  (TBIL),  and  creatinine  clearance  (CRCL)  on 
apparent  clearance  (CL/F)  of  erlotinib.  The  impact  of  the  continuous  covariates  appears  to  be  small 
compared to the observed overall variability. 
CL/F  appeared  to  be  slightly  higher  in  current  smokers  (≈20%)  than  in  those  who  never  smoked. 
Patients who had never smoked or who had quit smoking more than one year prior to randomisation 
were considered to be non-smokers for the use in the PK model.  
Pharmacodynamics 
A graphical analysis of a potential relationship between exposure to erlotinib and selected parameters 
of safety and efficacy was performed. Parameters of safety were rash and diarrhoea as the known most 
common  adverse  events  related  to  erlotinib.  The  range  of  exposure  values  observed  across  the 
different categories of rash and including those patients who did not develop rash appears to be similar 
(Figure 1). Higher grades of rash appeared to be associated with higher exposure to erlotinib. 
However, at all rash grades 1 - 3, the range of exposure overlaps with the exposure range observed in 
patients without rash (grade 0).

Figure 1: Normalised cumulative exposure to Erlotinib by rash grade 
Similarly for diarrhoea, the more severe grades 2 and 3 appeared to be associated with higher exposure 
to erlotinib (Figure 2). The small number of patients with higher grades of diarrhoea (14 patients with 
grade 2 and 6 patients with grade 3) might not allow drawing any firm conclusion, particularly as the 
ranges of exposure values in all diarrhoea grades are overlapping.

1.2.3  Clinical efficacy 
  Main study  
BO18192 study (SATURN)  
BO18192 was a multi-center, double-blind randomised Phase III, placebo-controlled study designed to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in the maintenance setting following first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV NSCLC.

Methods 
Study Participants  
The  target  population  for  this  study  comprised  patients  with  histologically  documented,  locally 
advanced  or  recurrent  (Stage  IIIb  and  not  amenable  for  combined  modality  treatment)  or  metastatic 
(Stage IV) NSCLC.  
A  total  of  1949  patients  entered  the  chemotherapy  run-in  period.  Of  these,  889  were  randomised  to 
receive either erlotinib 150 mg/day (438 patients) or placebo (451 patients) after having completed 4 
cycles  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  the  absence  of  unacceptable  toxicity  and/or  progressive 
disease (PD). At the time of data cut-off on 17 May 2008 (after 749 events of progression or death), 98 
patients were still on study drug (66 on erlotinib and 32 on placebo). 
Patients  were  recruited  at  110  centres  in  26  countries  (Europe,  North  America,  South  America  and 
Asia-Pacific).

Objectives 
Primary objectives 
Study BO18192 had two co-primary objectives:  
 
 
to determine  if administration of erlotinib in the maintenance phase after  standard platinum-
based chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC results in improved PFS when compared with 
placebo in the overall population.  
to  determine  if  administration  of  erlotinib  in  the  maintenance  phase  after  standard  platinum 
based chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC results in improved PFS when compared with 
placebo  in  patients  whose  tumours  are  EGFR  protein  expression  positive  as  assessed  by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
7 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives 
The following secondary objectives were defined: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to compare OS between the two treatment arms for all patients and for patients whose tumours 
are EGFR protein expression (IHC) positive.  
to compare PFS  and OS between the two treatment arms in patients whose tumours are EGFR 
protein expression (IHC) negative.  
to  perform  exploratory  evaluations  of  tumour-tissue  and  blood  samples  for  biological  or 
genomic determinants of outcome, including EGFR and Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 viral oncogene 
homolog  (K-ras)  mutational  status  and  EGFR  and  HER2  expression  status  and  of  other 
molecules involved in the signal transduction pathway. 
to compare time to symptom progression between the two treatment arms. 
to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  administering  erlotinib  after  standard  platinum  based 
chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC. 
to investigate by a population analysis approach the PK of erlotinib in the target population, 
including  the  influence  of  covariates  and  to  provide  post-hoc  estimates  of  exposure. 
Exploration  of  the  relationship  between  exposure  to  erlotinib  and  safety  and  efficacy 
parameters were performed. 
Randomisation 
Study  BO18192  was  a  two-arm,  randomised  study.  After  completing  4  cycles  of  platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy without disease progression, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either  placebo  or  erlotinib  150  mg/day.  Randomisation  was  stratified  using  an  adaptive  method 
(minimization)  that  ensured  a  balance  between  the  treatment  arms  for  the  following  factors:  EGFR 
protein  expression  by  IHC  (positive  vs.  negative  vs.  undetermined),  stage  of  disease  at  start  of 
chemotherapy  (IIIb  vs.  IV),  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  Performance  Status  (ECOG  PS  0 
vs.  1),  chemotherapy  regimen  (gemcitabine/cisplatin  vs.  carboplatin/docetaxel  vs.  other),  smoking 
status  (current  smoker  vs.  former  smoker)  and  region  (North  America,  South  America,  Western 
Europe,  Eastern  Europe, South  East  Asia  and  Africa).  Central  randomisation  and  drug  pack  number 
allocation were performed using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). 
Blinding  
The study was double-blinded with the sponsor, investigators, and patients unaware of the treatment 
assignment of each patient. Unblinding of patients that had progressed was possible if (in the opinion 
of the investigator) the use of an EGFR-TKI was the only option for second- or third-line treatment. 
Unblinding was done through a third party (IVRS).  
Statistical methods 
The study was powered to the two primary analyses of PFS, conducted in the overall population and in 
patients who had EGFR IHC positive tumours, respectively. The PFS observed in the patients treated 
with  placebo  in  the  previously  performed  TALENT  (BO16411)  study,  comparing  erlotinib  with 
placebo  as  first  line  therapy  for  advanced  NSCLC,  was  used  as  the  estimate  for  PFS  from 
randomisation  in  the  placebo  arm.  Overall,  the  study  had  a  5%  significance  level.  The  significance 
level was 3% for the analysis of the overall population and 2% for the EGFR IHC positive population. 
Following the interim analysis the significance levels to be used for the final analysis were 0.02934 for 
the  Full  Analysis  Set  (all  randomised  patients)  and  0.01967  for  the  EGFR  positive  subset.  For  the 
secondary  parameters  and  exploratory  analysis  further  tests  between  the  two  treatment  arms  were 
performed. All tests were 2-sided at an alpha-level of 5%.  
In order to detect a 25% improvement in the median PFS with erlotinib compared to placebo (HR=0.8) 
with 80% power at a 2-sided 3% significance level, 731 events (progression or death) were required. 
Assuming 18 months accrual, 6 months follow-up of last patient and a 5% dropout rate over 2 years,  
427 randomised patients per arm were required. 
8 
 
 
 
 
If 56% of patients were to dropout between start of chemotherapy and randomisation, due to disease 
progression or toxicity, etc, 971 patients per arm would need to be screened in order that 427 would be 
available for randomisation. Therefore, it was expected that approximately 2000 patients would have 
needed to be screened. 
If 50% of patients had EGFR IHC positive tumours, this would lead to approximately 215 randomised 
patients  per  arm  for  testing  the  treatment  difference in  PFS  for  EGFR  IHC  positive  population.  The 
HR was expected to be lower in this subset of patients. A test of the difference in PFS for EGFR IHC 
positive population at a 2-sided significance level of 2% would have 85% power to detect a HR of 0.7 
(360 events expected) and 66% power for a HR of 0.75 (365 events expected). 
Additional  considerations  were  done  for  the  first  secondary  endpoint  of  OS,  assuming  a  10  month 
median survival in the placebo arm. In order to detect a 25% improvement in the median survival with 
erlotinib  compared  to  placebo  (HR=0.8)  with  80%  power  at  a  2-sided  5%  significance  level,  641 
events (deaths) were required. Assuming 18 months accrual, 427 randomised patients per arm and 5% 
dropout  over  3  years,  641  events  were  expected  to  occur  at  approximately  15  months  after  the  last 
patient was randomised. 
Nominal P-values (unadjusted for multiplicity) are presented in all tables. 
Results 
Participant Flow 
The first patient entered the study on 29 March 2006. A total of 1949 patients (Figure 4) entered the 
chemotherapy  run-in  period,  and  subsequently  a  total  of  889  patients  that  completed  chemotherapy 
without progression and/or in absence of unacceptable toxicity were randomised 1:1 into the second 
part of the study, 438 patients in the erlotinb group and 451 patients in the placebo group. As of the 17 
May  2008  cut-off  date  for  the  final  analysis  on  PFS  (after  749  events  of  progression  or  death),  98 
patients  were  still  on  study  drug  (66  on  erlotinib  and  32  on  placebo).  Thus,  a  total  of  791  patients 
(88.9%)  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  population  had  discontinued  the  study,  372  (84.9%)  in  the 
erlotinib  group  and  419  (92.9%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  frequent  primary  reason  for  study 
discontinuation was investigator determined progressive disease, which was higher in the placebo than 
in  the  erlotinib  group  (84.9%  vs.  73.1%,  respectively).  Discontinuation  due  to  an  adverse  event  or 
death occurred in 6.6% of the patients in the erlotinb and 2.7% of the patients in the placebo group. 
Similar percentages of patients in the erlotinb and placebo groups discontinued study due to protocol 
violations  or  other  reasons  (refused  treatment  or  failed  to  return).  One  patient  who  had  been 
randomised    to  receive  placebo,  conducted  chemical  analysis  of  the  blinded  study  drug,  and 
subsequently stopped to take study medication and purchased erlotinib (independently of the study). 
This patient was excluded from the Per Protocol and the Safety Analysis Populations.

In general, biomarker subgroups were representative of the overall population, with a few exceptions 
(table 2). 
Table 2 Biomarker status Study BO18192 
In  general,  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  previous  diseases  and  medical 
procedures  related  and  unrelated  to  NSCLC,  and  co-morbidities  (which  were  present  in  74%  of 
patients in the placebo group compared with 69% in the erlotinib arm). The proportion of patients who 
received at least one concomitant treatment unrelated to NSCLC  was  slightly higher in the erlotinib 
compared with the placebo group (76% versus 69%, respectively). Moreover, during the randomised 
study  period,  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  received  treatment  for  AEs  in  the  erlotinib  group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group  (60%  versus  39%  respectively).  The  most  common  classes  of  drugs 
given for AEs were corticosteroids (20% versus 7%, respectively, including topical steroids for rash), 
and  opioid  analgesics  (12  and  13%,  respectively).  A  significantly  higher  percentage  of  patients 
received  antibiotics,  antihistamines,  antidiarrheals  and  dermatologic  agents  in  the  erlotinib  group 
compared with the placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
 
PFS in all randomised patients 
The analysis is based on 884 patients and 749 observed events (349 (79.9%) in the erlotinib and 400 
(87%) in the placebo group); 135 patients without event at time of analysis were censored. 
A statistically significant difference was observed for PFS in the Full Analysis Set (logrank p-value 
<0.001).  The  observed  HR  was  0.71,  (95%  CI:  0.62,  0.82)  and the  median  PFS  was  12.3  weeks  vs. 
11.1  weeks  for  erlotinib  compared  to  placebo,  respectively  (Table  3,  figure  5).  The  mean  PFS  was 
22.4 weeks in the erotinib group compared with 16.0 weeks in the placebo group.  Similar results were 
obtained  when  the  PFS  analysis  was  performed  according  to  the  independent  central  review 
assessment (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.84; concordance rate with investigator based PFS assessment: 
78-82%) and for the Per Protocol population (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.83).

  PFS in patients with EGFR IHC positive tumours 
The analysis was based on 618 patients and 522 observed events (244 (79.5%) in the erlotinib and 278 
(89%) in the placebo group); 99 patients without event at time of analysis were censored. 
The median PFS was 12.3 weeks in the erlotinib and 11.1 weeks in the placebo group (logrank 
p<0.001, Table 4, figure 6). The HR was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.82). The mean PFS was 22.8 weeks in 
the erlotinib group (range 0.1 to 78.9 weeks) compared with 16.2 weeks in the placebo group (range 
0.1 to 88.1 weeks). The progression free survival rate at 6 months was 27% and 16%, respectively for 
erlotinib and placebo.

Similar  results  were  obtained  when  the  PFS  analysis  was  performed  according  to  the  independent 
central  review  assessment  (HR:  0.66,  95%  CI:  0.54,  0.80,  p<0.0001)  and  for  the  Per  Protocol 
population (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82). 
 
PFS results adjusted for prognostic factors 
The adjusted HR for PFS in the erlotinib group relative to placebo group was 0.70 (95 % CI 0.59 to 
0.84, p<0.0001. Similar results were obtained for the EGFR IHC positive population (0.69[95 % CI 
0.57 to 0.84] p=0003) (Table 5).

 
OS in the FAS  
The cut-off date for the statistical analysis of these data was 17 May 2009. At that time point, 77.6% 
of patients in the placebo group and 68% of patients in the erlotinib group had an event (death). The 
updated  OS  analysis  showed  a  median  OS  of  11.0  months  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  a 
median OS of 12.0 months in the erlotinib group. The HR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.70; 0.95), p=0.0088 
(Table 6) (Figure 7).

Cut-off for statistical analysis: 17MAY2009 
Program : $PROD/cd11677d/bo18192/eratettd_g.sas / Output : $PROD/cd11677d/i18192v/reports/eratettd_g_2000.cgm

The  median  OS  benefit  was  10.6  months  and  12.5  months  in  the  placebo  and  erlotinib  groups, 
respectively in a supportive OS analysis censored by open-label erlotinib or second/further line TKI 
treatment.  
 
OS in the EGFR IHC positive population 
A  preliminary  analysis  of  OS  data  conducted  in  the  EGFR  IHC  positive  population  showed  similar 
results  to  the  overall  population  (median  OS:  12.7  months  in  erlotinib  and  12.1  months  in  placebo 
group; HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.14, p=0.3638).  
In  line  with  the  results  of  the  overall  population,  the  HR  for  the  EGFR  positive  subgroup  was  0.77 
(95% CI 0.64; 0.93), p=0.0063. The median OS was 11.0 months in the placebo arm vs. 12.8 months 
in the erlotinib arm (N=621).   
 
Time to Progression (TTP) 
Median TTP in the FAS was 12.3 weeks in erlotinib vs. 11.3 in placebo group. The HR was 0.70 (95% 
CI: 0.61, 0.82, logrank p<0.0001) (Table 7).

 
Best Response Rate and Disease Control 
Only patients who had not progressed during the 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were 
eligible to enter the randomised treatment phase of the study. Response during blinded 
erlotinib/placebo treatment was assessed as discussed in table 8: 
Table 8: Response assessment

No otherwise 
SD or PR or CR or PD 
Yes if best response = PR or 
CR, 
No otherwise 
In order to have best response as continued CR (for patients with CR at randomisation) the patient was 
required to remain tumour free for at least 6 weeks post baseline.  
For  patients  with  PR  or  SD  at  randomisation  a  best  response  of  CR  or  PR  required  follow-up 
measurements meeting the criteria for CR or PR at 2 consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart at any 
time post baseline. For best response SD follow-up measurements had to meet the SD criteria for at 
least 6 weeks post baseline. 
Response  assessments  which  were  recorded  as  missing  or  NA  at  a  visit  were  disregarded,  as  were 
responses  occurring  after  a  PD  assessment.  Patients  with  no  tumour  assessment  post-baseline  or 
missing best response were considered as non-responders and as patients with no response upgrade.  
Best Response rate (CR or PR after randomisation) as assessed by the investigators was 11.9% in the 
erlotinib  arm  compared  with  5.4%  in  the  placebo  arm  (p=0.0006,  4  and  3  CRs  respectively).  The 
proportion of PR was higher in the erlotinib group (11.0% vs. 4.7% respectively) and the rate of SD 
was similar in both treatment groups (48.6% vs. 45.4%).  
The  proportion  of  response  upgrade  was  5.5%  in  the  erlotinib  group  vs.  1.3%  in  the  placebo  group 
(p=0.0007). 
Disease Control (as defined as the number of patients with CR, PR or SD as best overall response) was 
60.6% in the erlotinib group vs. 50.8% in the placebo group (p=0.0035) and the percentage of patients 
with CR, PR or SD for more than 12 weeks was 40.8% in the erlotinib group vs.  27.4% in the placebo 
group (p<0.0001). 
 
Quality of life (QoL) and related outcomes 
451 patients in the placebo group and 438 patients in the erlotinib group were included in the analysis 
of QoL and related endpoints. Completion rates of questionnaires were above 90% at almost all study 
visits and were similar in both treatment groups.  
Time  to  symptom  progression  (defined  as  time  from  randomisation  until  a  clinically  meaningful 
decline (change of at least 3 points from baseline) in Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS) from baseline or 
death on study, whichever occurred first) was similar in both treatment groups (median 18.3 weeks in 
erlotinib  and  17.6  in  placebo  arms;  HR=0.91,  95%  CI:  0.74,  1.12,  p=0.3787),  as  well  as  time  to 
deterioration in quality of life, defined as deterioration of at least 6 points from baseline in the total 
FACT-L  score  (median  12.6  weeks  vs.  12.3  weeks,  respectively,  HR=0.96,  95%  CI:  0.79,  1.16, 
p=0.6530).

In  addition,  time  to  deterioration  in  Trial  Outcome  index  (defined  as  at  least  6-point  decline  from 
baseline in the sum of PWB, FWB, LCS) was 18.1 weeks in the erlotinib vs. 18.9 weeks in the placebo 
arm (HR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.31, p=0.5385).  
Ancillary analyses 
  Efficacy in patients with stable disease (SD) 
Further to CHMP request, the MAH provided efficacy data of erlotinib as maintenance therapy for 
patients with stable disease (RECIST criteria version 1.0). Documentation of progression was verified 
by independent central review. 
A  summary  of  the  distribution  between  treatment  arms  of  the  main  clinical  and  molecular 
characteristic in the SD population that may have prognostic or predictive value is given in Table 9 
and Table 10. In addition no imbalances were found between treatment arms when geographical, prior 
radiotherapy, subsequent systemic treatments and time to start of investigational treatment parameters 
were analysed.

Following investigators’ assessment the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary endpoint, progression free 
survival (PFS), according to stable disease (SD) as response to previous chemotherapy was 0.68 (95% 
CI 0.56 to 0.83, p<0.0001). Median PFS was 11.3 weeks in the placebo group versus 12.1 weeks in the 
erlotinib group (see Figure 8).

The PFS and OS results for the SD population as defined by the IRC supported the results as assessed 
by the investigator (see figure 11). The central review and the investigator review assessed patients as 
SD  according  to  RECIST version  1.0. According  to  the  central  review,  445  patients  had  SD  as  best 
response to first-line chemotherapy compared to 487 patients assessed as SD by investigator (INV).  
Randomization and primary efficacy analyses were based on INV assessment from baseline. The IRC 
assessment at baseline was post-hoc and retrospective and conducted to corroborate the pre-specified 
INV  non-progression  assessments  at  the  point  of  randomization  into  the  SATURN  study.  The  IRC 
assessment  lacked  data  from  multiple  patients,  due  to  missing  or  non-readable  scans,  as  well  as  the 
clinical information used for the INV baseline assessment.

The  time  to  symptom  progression,  time  to  deterioration  in  QoL  and  time  to  deterioration  in  Trial 
Outcome  Index  (TOI)  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (HR=0.92,  95%  CI  0.70  to  1.22, 
p=0.5768; HR=0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26, p=0.8291; and HR=1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.50, p=0.3534 
respectively). The QoL results observed for the SD population are in line with those observed in the 
Full Analysis Set. In both cases, no deterioration in quality of life was observed for patients receiving 
treatment with erlotinib compared to those receiving only placebo.

PFS by biomarker subgroups 
Further to CHMP request, the MAH provided an updated description of the total number  of tumour 
samples  and  the  number  of  patients  who  were  tested  EGFR  activating  mutation  positive  in  the 
SATURN  study  (Figure  10)  and  the  results  of  PFS  and  OS  for  both  the  EGFR  activating  mutation 
positive and negative (EGFR WT) patients in the subgroup of patients with known mutational status in 
the SATURN study.

OS data in the EGFR mutation positive subgroup were still immature, particularly in the erlotinib arm, 
as  only  8  patients  out  of  22  had  died  by  the  cut-off  date  (Table  14).  In  addition,  67%  of  placebo 
patients  in  the  EGFR  mutation  positive  subgroup  received  second  or  further  line  treatment  with 
EGFR-TKIs.  The  MAH  claimed  that  given  the  higher  sensitivity  in  this  population  towards  EGFR 
TKI treatment, this probably explains why the considerable benefit observed in PFS in this population 
did not translate into an OS benefit.

Sensitivity and post-hoc analyses 
A series of sensitivity and additional post-hoc analyses have been performed by the MAH to assess the 
robustness of the PFS results. 
1)  Association  between  the  investigators  and  independent  review  committee  determined  events  of 
disease progression: 
Overall concordance on progression between investigator and central review assessments was 78% for 
the erlotinib group and 82% for the placebo group. Sensitivity analyses were performed that account 
for  central  review  determined  events  of  disease  progression  rather  than  investigators  determined 
events  (for  all  patients  and  for  patients  with  EGFR  IHC  positive  population)  as  well  as  for  tumour 
assessment  at  baseline,  TTP,  Best  Overall  Response  and  Response  upgrade.  Further  sensitivity 
analyses  of  PFS  based  on  investigator  assessment  conducted  to  take  into  account  missing  or  not-
evaluable tumour assessments have been made. According to the MAH the results of the analyses are 
consistent with the treatment effect observed in the primary analysis of PFS. 
2) Subgroup Analyses by Stratification Factors and baseline  
According to the MAH, the results were consistent with the treatment effect observed in the primary 
analysis of PFS.

Stratification Factors 
3)  Sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS  for  FAS  population  excluding  patients  who  had  EGFR  activating 
mutation positive tumours. 
According to the MAH the results of this population were similar to those of the overall population 
(HR  0.76,  95%  CI:  0.66,  0.88,  p=  0.0002),  indicating  that  the  overall  PFS  result  was  not  entirely 
driven by the patients with EGFR activating mutation positive tumours.  
4) Cox-regression analysis adjusting for individual covariates (stratification factors, demographic and 
baseline characteristics, histology of NSCLC, previous treatments related to NSCLC, biomarkers). 
As  stated  by the  MAH,  the  HR  for  the  treatment  effect  was  not  significantly affected  by  any  of  the 
covariates confirming the robustness of the primary result. Multiple Cox-regressions for PFS adjusted 
for  identified  factors  (treatment,  age,  smoking  status,  disease  stage,  K-ras  mutations  and  EGFR 
mutations)  showed  that  the  treatment  effect  was  similar  to  the  unadjusted  analysis  (HR=0.71, 
p<0.0001).  No  sign  of  interaction  of  K-ras  mutation  and  treatment  was  observed,  but  the  test  for 
interaction of EGFR mutation and treatment was significant. 
In  conclusion,  for  all  these  sensitivity  analyses  performed  the  MAH  states  that  the  results  are 
consistent with the treatment effect observed in the primary analysis of PFS.  
5) Analysis of NSCLC-related symptomatology 
The MAH performed post-hoc analyses of time to pain, cough and dyspnoea. Time to pain and time to 
analgesics  (opioids  and  other  analgesics)  were  significantly  longer  for  patients  receiving  erlotinib 
compared  with  placebo  (HR=0.61,  95%  CI:  0.42, 0.88, p=0.008, and  HR=0.66,  95%  CI: 0.46, 0.94, 
p=0.0199, respectively).  
A not statistically significant trend vs. longer time to cough and time to dyspnoea was also found in 
the erlotinib group (HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.21, p=0.2546 and 0.75, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.17, p=0.2054, 
respectively). 
6) PFS, OS and EGFR polymorphism by grade of rash  
In study BO18192, a trend vs. longer PFS in patients treated with erlotinib who experienced rash of 
grade ≥ 2 has been reported by the MAH, but the results are not statistically significant. No significant 
associations between OS and EGFR polymorphism and grade of rash have been found. 
CHMP discussion on efficacy data 
The CHMP raised one major objection regarding the benefit of erlotinib given as maintenance therapy 
vs. erlotinib given at progression as currently indicated. OS and PFS benefits of erlotinib when given 
at progression are of similar magnitude, if not greater, than the ones observed in SATURN study with 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
erlotinib  as  maintenance  treatment  with  a  gain  in  median  OS  of  ≥  2  months  and  significant 
improvement in lung related symptoms control (Study BR21). 
The  MAH  justified  the  use  of  erlotinib  as  maintenance  therapy  instead  of  2nd  line  treatment  by 
explaining  that  a  majority  of  patients  experiences  a  rapid  progression  and  an  irreversible  decline  in 
performance  status  shortly  after  stopping  1st  line  therapy.  Consequently,  a  lot  of  patients  miss  the 
opportunity  to  actually  receive  a  2nd  line  therapy.  The  CHMP  however  asked  the  MAH  to  conduct 
further  analyses  to  identify  which  NSCLC  patients  might  benefit  from  treatment  with  erlotinib  in 
maintenance setting.   
The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  OS  analysis  by  histological  subtype.  These  results  showed  that  the 
benefits of erlotinib as maintenance therapy in patients with squamous cell histology are limited to a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS,  but  with  very  modest  clinical  relevance  as  a  gain  in 
median PFS only less than 1 week was observed. No difference in OS between erlotinib and placebo 
treated patients has been reported.  
In addition, concerns were raised by the CHMP based on the results of the PFS in patients with EGFR 
IHC  negative  tumours  and  preliminary  OS  analyses  showed  no  statistically  significant  neither 
clinically relevant effect of erlotinib in this subgroup of the population. 
The MAH commented that the sample size for the subgroup analyses is by definition underpowered 
and therefore while trends can be assessed in subpopulations, it is not considered justified to expect 
statistical significance to be shown for all subgroup analyses. The overall study was planned to show a 
PFS HR benefit of 0.8 as this was considered to be clinically meaningful. As the estimate of the PFS 
benefit  in  IHC  negative  patients  (HR  of  0.77)  was  below  the  pre-defined  threshold  that  had  been 
considered  as  clinically  meaningful,  the  estimated  benefit  observed  with  the  IHC  negative 
subpopulation should also be considered as clinically meaningful. 
The CHMP didn’t agree with the MAH and suggested that at least this subgroup of population should 
be excluded from any potential indication. 
Furthermore,  one  additional  major  objection  was  raised  by  the  CHMP  regarding  the  efficacy  of 
erlotinib in patients without an EGFR activating mutation. 
In reply to CHMP concerns, the MAH has provided updated PFS and OS data regarding the subgroup 
of patients enrolled in SATURN study with known EGFR mutational status.  
Based on these data, in the EGFR WT subgroup, the median PFS in placebo-treated patients was 8.9 
weeks  vs.  12.0  weeks  in  the  erlotinib  arm  with  a  HR  =  0.78  (95%  CI  0.64;  0.96),  p=0.0182.  The 
median OS was 10.2 months in the placebo group vs. 11.3 months in the erlotinib group. The HR for 
OS was 0.77 (95% CI 0.61; 0.97), p= 0.0243.  
The Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) -Oncology was consulted on the following questions:  
 
Does  the SAG  consider  the  use of  erlotinib  in  patients  with  NSCLC given  as  maintenance 
therapy after first-line therapy justified instead of giving it only at progression, as currently indicated, 
with the advantage of a treatment-free period?  
The SAG discussed the results and design of the available trials and agreed that it was not possible to 
conclude  on  the  pros  and  cons  of  erlotinib  given  as  “maintenance”  therapy  after  first-line  therapy 
versus erlotinib given after progression. To address such questions one would most likely need direct 
comparative data testing the outcome following either of the two strategies, in a relevant population. 
Concerning  “maintenance”  therapy  only,  the  available  efficacy  data  showed  only  a  very  modest 
efficacy  in  the  overall  population.  A  number  of  exploratory  subgroup  analyses  were  presented  and 
larger effects were claimed to be associated with erlotinib treatment in some subgroups. However, the 
SAG  agreed  by  consensus  that  these  differences  were  generally  of  limited  clinical  and  statistical 
significance  (also  taking  into  account  the  exploratory  nature  of  these  analyses),  with  one  notable 
exception, namely the analysis in the subgroup of patients with tumours with activating mutations in 
the  EGFR  gene.  In  this  subgroup,  a  dramatic  effect  was  associated  with  erlotinib  with  an  estimated 
HR of .09 (CI: 0.03-0.25). Although some effect was also claimed in patients with EGFR mutation-
negative tumours, the SAG agreed that this effect was too marginal to be of any clinical significance. 
32 
 
 
 
 
The  SAG  agreed  by  consensus  that  based  on  the  data  presented  and  knowledge  about  the  role  of 
mutations for tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in NSCLC, presence of activating mutation in the EGFR gene 
is currently the only convincing characteristic for selecting patients for treatment with erlotinib. It is 
expected that this characteristic would be necessary regardless of the indication of “maintenance” or 
second-line. 
The SAG did not agree with the argument that some activity was also observed in patients in whom 
there was no evidence of activating mutation in the EGFR gene, and that this would therefore question 
the importance of this selection criterion. The SAG argued that the activity in patients in whom there 
was  no  evidence  of  activating  mutation  was  too  marginal  to  be  of  any  clinical  significance. 
Furthermore,  the  SAG  argued  that  any  remaining  activity  in  that  subgroup  could  be  due  to  the  low 
sensitivity  of  the  assay  (67%),  so  that  tumours  with  activating  mutation  could  have  wrongly  been 
classified as having no evidence of activating mutation. 
The  MAH  should  present  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  efficacy  and  toxicity  of  erlotinib  by 
presence  of  activating  mutation  in  the  EGFR  gene,  in  the  relevant  indications,  to  gain  further 
understanding about the effects in this subgroup. 
 
Does  the  SAG  consider  the clinical  benefit  of  erlotinib  when  given  as  maintenance 
therapy after first line therapy adequately demonstrated in patients with squamous lung cell tumours 
where there currently is an unmet medical need, but where only a statistically significant improvement 
by erlotinib was noted in PFS, but either in OS nor in related symptom control? 
The SAG agreed by consensus that histology was not a good characteristic for selecting patients for 
treatment  with  erlotinib.  Although  small  treatment  differences  were  observed  in  this  subgroup 
depending  on  erlotinib  treatment,  due  to  the  exploratory  analyses  it  was  difficult  to  draw  firm 
conclusions.  EGFR  mutation  status  appeared  to  be  the  only  convincing  characteristic  for  selecting 
patients for treatment with erlotinib (see answer to question No. 1). 
  Does  the  SAG  consider  the  clinical benefit  of  erlotinib  when  given  as  maintenance  therapy  after 
first-line therapy adequately demonstrated in patients with other than predominantly squamous lung 
cell  histology  vs.  the  current  standard  option,  in  particular  pemetrexed,  where  the  magnitude  of 
benefits in terms of PFS and OS was larger? 
It is difficult to compare the clinical efficacy of erlotinib versus other treatment options in the absence 
of  comparative  data.  The SAG  agreed  by  consensus  that histology  was  not  a good  characteristic  for 
selecting patients for treatment with erlotinib and that EGFR mutation status  appeared to be the only 
convincing characteristic for selecting patients (see answer to question No. 1). 
CHMP conclusion 
Further to CHMP request, efficacy in a subgroup of patients with stable disease was analysed by the 
MAH. In this additional analysis, the HR for PFS was 0.68 (95% CI 0.56; 0.83, p<0.0001) and the HR 
for  OS  was  0.72  (95%  CI:  0.59;  0.89;  p=0.0019).  The  difference  in  median  OS  was  2.3  months. 
Further exploratory analyses showed that the results were consistent across the levels of other factors, 
and no imbalances have been identified that could have biased the study results.  
The MAH committed to assess the feasibility of investigating the relative benefits of treatment with 
Tarceva prior to progression and post-progression in NSCLC, and if feasible and agreed between the 
MAH and CHMP, to conduct such an investigation. In addition, the MAH committed to provide 
information to optimize therapy in patients with EGFR activating mutation positive tumours by: 1) a- 
submission of currently available data and 2) b- Submission of CSR from Phase III on-going study 
(EURTAC: Phase III, Multicenter, Open-label, Randomised  Study of Erlotinib (Tarceva) Treatment 
Versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Non-small-cell Carcinoma of the Lung Who Present 
Mutations in the Tyrosine Kinase (TK) Domain of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)). 
Given the very modest efficacy in the broad indication and the larger treatment effect seen in patients

1.2.4  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety population of SATURN study included 433 patients in the erlotinib group and 445 in the 
placebo  group,  as  11  patients  (5  and  6,  respectively)  of  the  FAS  were  excluded  from  the  safety 
analysis:  seven  patients  (3  in  the  erlotinib  group,  4  in  the  placebo  group)  did  not  receive  study 
treatment and 4 (2 in each group) did not have any safety follow-up. 
The median total cumulative dose of erlotinib was 12,750 mg with median exposure duration of 12.3 
weeks. As expected due to the shorter PFS, the placebo group had slightly shorter median duration of 
exposure  (11.7  weeks)  and  a  lower  median  total  cumulative  dose  (12,300  mg).  Ninety-five  patients 
(22%) received study drug for more than 6 months in the erlotinib group compared with 58 patients 
(13%) in the placebo group.  
The median dose intensity in both groups was 150 mg/day.  
In the erlotinib group, 11% of patients experienced erlotinib dose reduction to 100 mg daily and 1% 
had a reduction to less than 100 mg daily. In the placebo group, 3 patients (<1%) had dose reductions. 
In the erlotinib group 10% of patients had a dose interruption of less than 1 week (placebo group 5%) 
while 6% had dose interruptions lasting 1 week or more (placebo 1%) (Table 16). 
34 
 
 
Table 16: Patient Exposure 
Adverse events (AE) 
More  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  at  least  1  AE  (78.8%, 
compared with 54.2%), AEs leading to withdrawal from treatment (4.6%, compared with 1.6%) or to 
dose  modification  or  interruption  (16.2%  vs.  3.4%,  respectively)  (Table  17).  A  significantly  higher 
number  of  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  experienced  AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment 
(64.9% vs. 20.0%, respectively), severe (Grade ≥ 3) AEs (24.7% vs. 12.1%, respectively), and severe 
AEs  related  to  study  drug  (2.3%  vs.  0.2%).  A  large  proportion  of  these  differences  were  due  to  the 
higher number of patients who developed rash or diarrhoea in the erlotinib group.  
35 
 
 
 
 
Table 17: Overall Summary of AEs in SATURN Study 
The  body  systems  with  the  highest  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  erlotinib  group  were  “skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders”  (63.0%,  vs.  12.6%  in placebo  group)  and  “gastrointestinal  disorders” 
(30.5%, vs. 16.0% in placebo group), reflecting the fact that the most common AEs among erlotinib-
treated patients were rash and diarrhoea. Other body systems in which there was a higher incidence of 
AEs on erlotinib treatment include “general disorders and administration site conditions” (23.8% vs. 
16.0%,  especially  due  to  fatigue,  asthenia,  pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation  and  xerosis),  “infections 
and  infestations”  (16.9%  vs.  8.1%,  primarily  due  to  paronychia,  pneumonia  and  respiratory  tract 
infection),  “metabolism  and  nutritional  disorders”  (10.4%  vs.  7.0%,  particularly  due  to  anorexia), 
“investigations”  (7.2%  vs.  2.5%),  “eye  disorders”  (4.8%  vs.  2.2%,  especially  conjunctivitis), 
“psychiatric  disorders”  (4.6%  vs.  2.0%,  especially  insomnia,  anxiety  and  depression),  and  “ear  and 
labyrinth disorders” (1.6% vs. 0.2%). 
Common AEs 
Consistent  with  findings  from  other  clinical  studies  of  single-agent  erlotinib,  rash  (49.2%)  and 
diarrhoea  (20.3%)  are  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  in  the  erlotinib  group,  and  were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in 48.5% and 18.2% of patients, respectively. 
These were the only AEs with an incidence ≥ 10%. 
Adverse events regardless of causality that occurred with an incidence ≥ 3% among erlotinib-treated 
patients  are  listed  in  Table  18.  Such  AEs  have  been  also  considered  related  to  study  drug  in  the 
majority  of  patients  treated  with  erlotinib.  AEs  for  which  the  incidence  in  the  erlotinib  arm  was 
notably higher than in the placebo arm include several skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders ([rash 
49.2% vs. 5.8%], pruritus [7.4% vs. 2.7%], acne [6.2% vs. 0%], dermatitis acneiform [4.6% vs. 1.1%], 
dry  skin  [4.4%  vs.  <1%]),  as  well  as  diarrhoea  (20.3%  vs.  4.5%),  nausea  (7.6%  vs.  6.1%  ),  fatigue 
(9.0%  vs.  5.8%),  asthenia  (4.2%  vs.  2.9%),  pneumonia  (3%  vs.  1.6%),  paronychia  (3.9%  vs.  0%), 
anorexia (9.2% vs. 4.9%), and weight decrease (3.9% vs. <1%).  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 18: Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 3% of Patients in Erlotinib Group (Safety Population 
SATURN study) 
Throughout  the  SATURN  study,  most  AEs  were  of  mild  (grade  1)  or  moderate  (grade  2)  severity 
(grade 1 or 2 events: 54% in the erlotinib group vs. 42% in the placebo group) although there was a 
higher proportion of patients with ≥ grade 3 adverse events in the erlotinib group (24.7% vs. 12.1%). 
Among the body systems, ≥ grade 3 adverse events occurred notably more often in the erlotinib group 
than  in  the  placebo  group  among  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (9.0%  vs.  0%), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (3.9%  vs.  <1%),  and  infections  (3.7%  vs.  1.6%).  These  differences  were 
primarily the result of differences in the preferred terms rash (6.0% vs. 0%), diarrhoea (1.8% vs. 0%), 
and pneumonia (1.8% vs. 0.9%). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
Forty-seven  patients  (10.9%)  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  34  patients  (7.6%)  in  the  placebo  group 
experienced  one  or  more  SAEs.  Ten  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  1  in  the  placebo  group 
experienced  SAEs  that  were  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  study  drug.  In  the  erlotinib 
group,  these  related  serious  adverse  events  were  diarrhoea  (3  patients),  rash  (2  patients),  interstitial 
lung  disease  (ILD)  (2  patients),  pulmonary  fibrosis  (1  patient),  increased  ALT/AST  (1  patient)  and 
respiratory tract infection (1 patient). One of the patients with related interstitial lung disease died due 
to  the  event.  For  this  patient  the  cause  of  death  was  ultimately  assessed  as  progressive  disease, 
although the investigator could not rule out ILD. The study drug-related SAEs reported in SATURN 
study are consistent with the know safety profile of single-agent erlotinib. 
Other  SAEs  regardless  of  causality  that  occurred  in  more  than  1  patient  in  the  erlotinib  group  were 
pneumonia  (erlotinib  7  patients,  placebo  4  patients),  diarrhoea  (erlotinib  4  patients,  placebo  none), 
dyspnoea (2 patients in each group), and cardio-respiratory arrest (erlotinib 2 patients, placebo none).  
37 
 
 
 
Study BO18192 is ongoing, with follow-up continuing for patients alive at the time of the study cut-
off date (17 May 2008) to provide data for a final analysis of overall survival. At the time of the study 
cut-off, 157 patients in the erlotinib group and 176 patients in the placebo group had died during the 
follow-up phase, most due to disease progression (148 and 171 patients, respectively). 
Sixty-six patients died during the treatment phase (or within 28 days of last dose), 35 patients in the 
erlotinib  group  (8.1%)  and  31  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (7.0%):  of  them,  26  and  27  patients, 
respectively, died due to progressive disease. Nine patients in the erlotinib group and 3 patients in the 
placebo  group  died  on-study  due  to  an  AE.  None  of  these  events  have  been  assessed  as  causally 
related to erlotinib (Table 19).  
An additional 3 patients (1 in the erlotinib group [Interstitial lung disease] and 2 in the placebo group 
[haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident]) had Grade 5 AEs, but the final investigator assessment was 
that  they  died  due  to  disease  progression.  However,  in  the  investigator’s  opinion,  the  event  of 
interstitial lung disease was related to erlotinib.  
Table 19: Summary of Deaths During Treatment Phase 
Adverse Events leading to withdrawal 
Twenty patients (4.6%) in the erlotinib group and 7 patients (1.6%) in the placebo group discontinued 
study  medication  as  a  result  of  an  AE.  Among  these  20  patients,  12  had  AEs  considered  related  to 
study drug. Five patients in the erlotinib group were withdrawn due to rash (all considered related to 
study  drug)  and  2  due  to  diarrhoea  (both  considered  related  to  study  drug).  Other  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal in the erlotinib group included interstitial lung disease (2 patients), cardiorespiratory arrest, 
dermatitis  acneiform,  gastric  perforation,  pneumonia,  non-cardiac  chest  pain,  pulmonary  fibrosis, 
fatigue, urogenital haemorrhage, cardiac failure, dyspnoea, and transaminases increased. 
In the erlotinib group, 36 patients (8.3%) had dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) due to 
rash (none in the placebo group), and 14 patients (3.2%) had dose modifications due to diarrhoea (1 in 
the placebo group). 
Laboratory findings 
In general, the abnormalities in clinical laboratory data reported in SATURN study are consistent with 
laboratory evaluation results observed in previous clinical studies performed with erlotinib. 
Blood Chemistry: Grade 1 or 2 laboratory parameter values were common in both treatment groups. 
There were no grade 4 AST, ALT, bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase values recorded during the study 
among  patients  who  received  erlotinib.  There  were  10  occurrences  of  grade  3  liver  function  test 
increases  in  8  patients.  Two  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  with  normal  AST  and  ALT  values  at 
baseline  experienced  grade  3  AST  and  ALT  values  during  the  study  (1  with  an  AE  reported  as 
transaminase  increase)  and  3  additional  patients  with  normal  ALT  values  at  baseline  experienced 
grade 3 ALT values during the study (all of whom had ALT increases reported as AEs). None of these 
5  patients  had  known  liver  metastasis.  Grade  3  elevations  in  alkaline  phosphatase  occurred  in  2 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients  (neither  with  associated  reported  AE),  one  with  a  grade  1  value  at  baseline  (no  reported 
metastasis) and one with a grade 2 value at baseline (reported liver metastasis).  
One  patient  in  the  erlotinib  group  with  a  normal  total  bilirubin  at  baseline  developed  a  grade  3 
bilirubin value during the study, which was also reported as a grade 3 adverse event. 
In the erlotinib group, grade 4 blood chemistry laboratory parameter values were limited to 2 patients 
with  normal  potassium  levels  at  baseline  who  had  grade  4  elevations  during  the  study  (neither  of 
whom  had  diarrhoea  reported  as  an  adverse  event)  and  1  patient  with  grade  4  decline  in  potassium 
who  was  receiving  2  diuretics  during  the  study.  One  patient  in  the  erlotinib  group  had  a  grade  3 
creatinine  value  during  treatment,  after  entering  the  study  with  grade  1  creatinine  at  baseline.  This 
increase on Day 130 was reported as acute renal failure on the AE CRF. The patient was treated with 
intravenous fluids and the condition resolved without sequelae. The acute renal failure was considered 
by the investigator to be not related to erlotinib. 
Haematology:  The  erlotinib  group  had  more  patients  shift  from  normal  white  blood  cell  count  at 
baseline to grade 1 during the study compared to the placebo group (15 patients vs. 9 patients) and for 
lymphocytes  (21  patients  vs.  8).  Grade  3  and  4  haematology  laboratory  parameter  values  were 
uncommon and not associated with clinically significant events. 
Safety in patients with stable disease (SD) 
The  frequency  and  intensity  of  AEs  observed  for  the  SD  population  is  in  line  with  the  AE  results 
observed in the overall population (Table 20). More patients in the erlotinib group than in the placebo 
group experienced at least one AE. However, the majority of AEs reported were mild or moderate in 
intensity (NCI-CTC Grade 1 or 2). Similar to the overall population, the most commonly reported AEs 
in the SD population for patients receiving erlotinib were “rash” (overall: 60.3% erlotinib versus 9.4% 
placebo;  SD:  61.2%  erlotinib  versus  9.9%  placebo)  and  diarrhoea  (overall:  20.3%  erlotinib  versus 
4.5% placebo; SD: 21.2% erlotinib versus 4.7% placebo).  
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal was low in both the SD and overall populations 
(table  20).  In  the  SD  population  only  9  patients  (3.6%)  in  the  erlotinib  arm  had  an  AE  leading  to 
withdrawal considered to be related to study treatment compared to 1 patient in the placebo group.

Deaths 
A summary of deaths that occurred during the treatment phase of the study is provided in Table 21 for 
both the overall and SD populations. The incidence of deaths is comparable for both populations.  
In the SD population, 45 patients died during the  treatment phase, 23 patients in the erlotinib group 
(9%) and 22 patients in the placebo group (9%). Seven patients in the erlotinib group and 5 patients in 
the  placebo  group  had  Grade  5  AEs.  All  Grade  5  AEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  considered 
unrelated to study treatment.

Extent of Exposure, Dose Modifications and Interruptions 
The dose intensity was comparable in both the SD and the overall populations. In the SD population, 
the median dose intensity in both erlotinib and placebo arms was 150 mg/day, ranging from 59 mg to 
150 mg in the erlotinib group and 106 mg to 150 mg in the placebo group. Overall, the proportion of 
patients needing dose reductions or interruptions was low in the SD population and was comparable to 
the overall population. 
Among patients who received erlotinib, 26 (10%) had their dose reduced from 150 mg to 100 mg and 
3 (1%) had further dose reductions. Erlotinib dose interruptions lasting less than 1 week occurred in 
6% of the patients, while 10% had dose interruptions lasting > 1 week. Overall, 46 patients (20%) in 
the erlotinib group had a dose reduction or interruption. Only 1 patient in the placebo group had dose 
reductions and 14 patients (6%) had dose reductions or interruptions.  
Safety in special groups 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  regardless  of  causality  occurring  in  at  least  5%  of  the  patients  was 
analyzed by gender, age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), race (White vs. Asian), and baseline performance status 
(0 vs. 1). In general, the observations from analyses of intrinsic factors are as expected and consistent 
with  those  reported  for  similar  analyses  performed  in  other  erlotinib  studies.  Specifically,  overall 
adverse event incidences are higher among women compared with men, older patients compared with 
younger patients, and ECOG PS 1 patients compared with ECOG PS 0 patients. No association was 
found between incidence of adverse events and smoking status. In addition, consistent with previous 
analyses  was  the  observation  that  Asians  had  a  notably  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  when 
compared  with  Whites:  Asians  receiving  erlotinib  reported  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  skin 
disorders  (90.2%  vs.  57.9%,  especially  rash  [74%  vs.  45%]),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (44.3%  vs. 
27.6%, mostly diarrhoea [31% vs. 18%], nausea [11.5% vs. 7.1%], and anorexia [14.8% vs. 8.5%]), 
respiratory and thoracic events (50.8% vs. 16.9%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(37.7% vs. 20.8%), infections and infestation (42.6% vs. 12.6%), nervous system disorders (18.0% vs. 
9.8%),  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (16.4%  vs.  9.0%),  and  metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders (16.4% vs. 9.6%).

Interaction with other medicinal products: Caution 
should be exercised when ciprofloxacin or potent 
CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine) are 
combined with erlotinib. If adverse events related to 
erlotinib are observed, the dose of erlotinib may be 
reduced 
The Annex II has been updated accordingly. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
The RMP was acceptable to the CHMP.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of erlotinib as observed in SATURN study (B018192) appears to be consistent with 
that  observed  in  previous  clinical  studies  of  single-agent  erlotinib  in  NSCLC  and  during  post-
marketing  surveillance.  Patients  receiving  erlotinib  in  SATURN  study  experienced  diarrhoea  (all 
grades [20.3%] and grade ≥ 3 [1.8%]) and rash (all grades [49%]) at significantly lower incidence than 
observed  in  other  study  conducted  in  NSCLC  (i.e.,  BR  21,  55%,  6%  and  76%,  respectively)  where 
erlotinib was administered as monotherapy at the same starting dose.  Differences in study populations 
could  eventually  explain  these  discrepancies,  as  lower  incidence  of  the  same  adverse  events  were 
reported  also  in  the  placebo  group  of  SATURN  study  compared  with  placebo  group  of  BR21  study 
(rash all grades: 5.8% vs. 17%; diarrhoea all grades: 4.5% vs. 19%, respectively). 
The  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  as  observed  in  Study  BO18192  is  consistent  with  that  observed  in 
previous clinical studies of single-agent erlotinib in NSCLC and during post-marketing surveillance. 
No new unexpected safety signals have been observed. 
Overall Discussion and Benefit-Risk assessment  
In  the  full  analysis  set,  erlotinib  was  associated  with  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the 
primary endpoint PFS (HR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82, p<0.001).  
43 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Concerning  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  erlotinib  was  also  associated  with  an  improvement  in  OS 
(HR:  0.81,  95%  CI:  0.70,  0.95;  p=  0.0088),  however  no  improvement  in  quality  of  life  or  cancer 
related symptom control was reported. 
In line with the advice of the SAG-Oncology, the CHMP concluded that the benefit in terms of PFS 
and OS was considered marginal and, as it was not supported by an improvement in quality of life or 
cancer  related  symptom  control,  and  did  not  outweigh  the  risks  associated  with  treatment.  The 
evaluation of the adverse events experienced by patients confirmed that patients treated with erlotinib 
presented  a  statistically  significant  higher  incidence  (compared  with  placebo)  of  adverse  events, 
serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal, with diarrhoea, rash and infections 
being the most frequent side effects reported in a significant part of the population. Thus, the CHMP 
requested  the  applicant  to  try  to  identify  a  restricted  population  for  whom  the  benefit-risk  balance 
could be considered favourable with a clinically relevant effect in terms of important clinical efficacy 
endpoints. 
Following  the  SAG  recommendations  the  CHMP  assessed  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  EGFR 
activating  mutations.  In  this  subgroup  the  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  associated  with  erlotinib 
administration (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12, 0.45, p<0.0001, median PFS 13.0 weeks with placebo versus 
46.1  weeks  with  erlotinib)  was  very  large.  However,  this  analysis  was  based  on  too  few  patients  to 
draw any firm conclusion. 
In  a  subgroup  of  patients  with  stable  disease  it  was  observed  based  on  post  hoc  analysis  that  the 
treatment effect was larger (HR for PFS 0.68, 95% CI 0.56; 0.83, p<0.0001 and HR for OS 0.72, 95% 
CI:  0.59;  0.89;  p=0.0019).  Albeit  based  on  post-hoc  analyses  of  a  secondary  endpoint,  the  effect 
observed in the subgroup of patients with SD at baseline was considered of clinical relevance in this 
patient population with a generally poor prognosis. The treatment effect was consistent across strata 
and  endpoints,  and  no  important  imbalances  have  been  identified  that  could  have  biased  the  study 
results.  In  addition,  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  AEs  observed  for  the  SD  population  was  in  line 
with the AE results observed in the overall population. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the Benefit-Risk ratio of erlotinib for the restricted indication as 
monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer with stable disease following 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy 
is positive. 
All  the  proposed  consequential  changes  to  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  and  the 
Package Leaflet were agreed. 
Further,  the  MAH  has  updated  annex  II  to  reflect  the  latest  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(version 1.1) agreed with the CHMP.

CONCLUSION 
On  18  March  2010  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

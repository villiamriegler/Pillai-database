The recommended dose is 25 mg duvelisib twice daily. A cycle consists of 28 days. Treatment should 
be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Delayed or missed doses 
Patients should be advised that if a dose is missed by less than 6 hours, the missed dose should be 
taken right away and the next dose should be taken as usual. If a dose is missed by more than 6 hours, 
patients should be advised to wait and to take the next dose at the usual time. 
Dose modification for concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors  
The dose of Copiktra should be reduced to 15 mg twice daily when co-administered with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) [see section 4.5]. No dose adjustment is necessary when co-
administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) but potential adverse reactions of 
duvelisib should be closely monitored. 
Dose modifications for adverse reactions  
Toxicities should be managed as per Table 1 with dose reduction, treatment hold, or discontinuation of 
Copiktra.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
The safety and efficacy of duvelisib after prior idelalisib use has not been established. 
Infections  
Serious, including fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving duvelisib. The most common 
serious infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and lower respiratory infections. Median time to onset of 
any grade infection was 3 months with 75% of cases occurring within 6 months (see section 4.8).   
Any infections should be treated prior to initiation of duvelisib. Patients should be monitored for 
infection, including respiratory signs and symptoms, throughout treatment. Patients should be advised 
to report any new or worsening infections promptly (see Table 1 for management).  
Serious, including fatal, PJP pneumonia  occurred in patients taking duvelisib. Prophylaxis for PJP 
should, therefore, be administered to all patients (see Table 1). CMV reactivation/infection occurred in 
patients taking duvelisib. Prophylactic antivirals should be considered during treatment to prevent 
CMV infection including CMV reactivation (see Table 1). 
Recommended prophylaxis  
Any infections should be treated prior to initiation of duvelisib . Patients should be monitored for 
infection, including respiratory signs and symptoms, throughout treatment. Patients should be advised 
to report any new or worsening infections promptly (see Table 1 for management). 
Prophylaxis for PJP should be provided during treatment with duvelisib. Following completion of 
duvelisib treatment, PJP prophylaxis should be continued until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is 
greater than 200 cells/µL. 
Duvelisib should be withheld in patients with suspected PJP of any grade and discontinued if PJP is 
confirmed.  
Prophylactic antivirals should be considered during duvelisib treatment to prevent CMV infection 
including CMV reactivation.  
Diarrhoea or colitis 
Serious, including fatal diarrhoea or colitis occurred in patients receiving duvelisib. The median time 
to onset of any grade diarrhoea or colitis was 4 months, with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The 
median event duration was 0.5 months.  Patients should be advised to report any new or worsening 
diarrhoea (see Table 1 for management) (see section 4.8). 
Cutaneous reactions  
Serious, including fatal cutaneous reactions occurred in patients receiving duvelisib. Fatal cases 
included drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN). Median time to onset of any grade cutaneous reaction was 3 months, with a median 
event duration of 1 month (see section 4.8).  
Presenting features for the serious cutaneous events were primarily described as pruritic, 
erythematous, or maculo-papular. Less common presenting features include exanthem, desquamation, 
erythroderma, skin exfoliation, keratinocyte necrosis, and papular rash. Patients should be advised to 
report any new or worsening cutaneous reactions (see Table 1 for management). All concomitant 
medicinal products should be reviewed and any medicinal products potentially contributing to the 
event should be discontinued.

Pneumonitis 
Serious, including fatal, pneumonitis without an apparent infectious cause occurred in patients 
receiving duvelisib. Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months with 75% of cases 
occurring within 9 months (see section 4.8). The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of 
cases resolving by 2 months (see Table 1 for management).  
Hepatotoxicity  
Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in patients receiving duvelisib. Two percent of 
patients had both an ALT or AST greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN. 
Median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months with a median event duration 
of 1 month. Hepatic function should be monitored during treatment with duvelisib especially during 
the first three months of therapy on a monthly basis. This guideline applies for the patients who have 
only ALT and AST elevation.  
Neutropenia  
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in patients receiving duvelisib. The median time to onset of Grade 
≥ 3 neutropenia was 2 months with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Neutrophil counts should 
be monitored at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of duvelisib.   
CYP3A4 inducers 
Duvelisib exposure may be reduced when co-administered with strong CYP3A inducers. Since a 
reduction in duvelisib plasma concentrations may result in decreased efficacy, co-administration of 
duvelisib with strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
CYP3A substrates 
Duvelisib and its major metabolite, IPI-656, are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Thus, duvelisib has the 
potential to interact with medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to 
increased serum concentrations of the other product (see section 4.5). When duvelisib is co-
administered with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the 
other medicinal product must be consulted for the recommendations regarding co-administration with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant treatment of duvelisib with sensitive CYP3A substrates should be 
avoided and alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used 
if possible. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on duvelisib pharmacokinetics  
Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of 600 mg once daily rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 7 days with a single 
oral 25 mg duvelisib dose in healthy adults (N = 13) decreased duvelisib Cmax by 66% and AUC by 
82%.  Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve 
(AUC) (see section 5.2), which may reduce duvelisib efficacy. Co-administration of duvelisib with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., apalutamide, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, 
rifampin, St. John’s wort) should be avoided.  
Co-administration of 200 mg twice daily etravirine, a moderate CYP3A inducer, for 10 days with a 
single oral 25 mg duvelisib dose in healthy adults (N = 20) decreased duvelisib Cmax by 16% and AUC 
by 35%. Co-administration of duvelisib with moderate CYP3A inducers decreases AUC of duvelisib 
to less than 1.5-fold and dose reduction is not recommended. Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
are bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, phenobarbital, primidone.   If a moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used, the patient should be closely monitored for potential lack of efficacy. Examples: bosentan, 
efavirenz, etravirine, phenobarbital, primidone.  
Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (at 200 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days), 
with a single oral 10 mg dose of duvelisib in healthy adults (n= 16) increased duvelisib Cmax by 1.7-
fold and AUC by 4-fold. Due to time-dependent CYP3A4 auto-inhibition, duvelisib susceptibility to 
moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is decreased under steady-state conditions.  Based on 
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulation , the increase in exposure to 
duvelisib is estimated to be ~1.6-fold at steady state in cancer patients when concomitantly used with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole and itraconazole.  
Duvelisib dose should be reduced to 15 mg twice daily when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor (see section 4.2) (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodon, cobicistat, voriconazole and posaconazole, and 
grapefruit juice).  
PBPK modelling and simulation estimated no clinically significant effect on duvelisib exposures from 
concomitantly used moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose reduction of duvelisib is not necessary when 
co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.2) (e.g., aprepitant, ciprofloxacin, 
conivaptan, crizotinib, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, 
imatinib, tofisopam, verapamil)  
Effect of duvelisib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrates  
Co-administration of multiple doses of duvelisib 25 mg BID for 5 days with single oral 2 mg 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy adults (N = 14), increased in the midazolam 
AUC by 4.3-fold and Cmax by 2.2-fold. PBPK simulations in cancer patients under steady state 
conditions have shown that the Cmax and AUC of midazolam would increase by approximately 2.5-fold 
and ≥5- fold respectively.  Co-administration of midazolam with duvelisib should be avoided.  
Duvelisib and its major metabolite, IPI-656, are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose reduction of 
CYP3A4 substrate should be considered when co-administered with duvelisib,especially for medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic index. Patients should be monitored for signs of toxicities of the co-
administered sensitive CYP3A substrate. Examples of sensitive substrates include: alfentanil, avanafil, 
buspirone, conivaptan, darifenacin, darunavir, ebastine, everolimus, ibrutinib, lomitapide, lovastatin, 
midazolam, naloxegol, nisoldipine, saquinavir, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, tipranavir, 
triazolam, vardenafil, budesonide, dasatinib, dronedarone, eletriptan, eplerenone, felodipine, indinavir, 
lurasidone, maraviroc, quetiapine, sildenafil, ticagrelor, tolvaptan.  Examples of moderately sensitive 
substrsates include: alprazolam, aprepitant, atorvastatin, colchicine, eliglustat, pimozide, rilpivirine, 
rivaroxaban, tadalafil. This list is not exhaustive and is intended to serve as guidance only. The SmPC 
for the other product should be consulted for recommendations regarding co-administration with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
It is unknown whether duvelisib reduces the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, 
women using hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method as a second form of 
contraception (see section 4.6). 
Proton pump inhibitors 
Population Pharmacokinetic (POPPK) analysis has shown that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) do not 
affect the exposure of COPIKTRA. PPI may be co-administered with duvelisib 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of duvelisib in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (see 
section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Copiktra during 
pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding  
It is not known whether duvelisib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  A risk to the 
breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Copiktra and for at least 1 month after the last dose.  
Fertility  
No human data on the effect of duvelisib on fertility are available. In rats, but not in monkeys, effects 
on testes were observed.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Copiktra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are diarrhoea or colitis, 
neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, 
musculoskeletal pain, and anaemia.  
The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, colitis and diarrhoea.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections  
The most common serious infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and lower respiratory infections.  
Median time to onset of any grade infection was 3 months (range: 1 day to 32 months), with 75% of 
cases occurring within 6 months. Infections should be treated prior to initiation of duvelisib. Patients 
should be advised to report any new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection.  
For management of infections see sections 4.2 (Table 1) and 4.4. 
Diarrhoea and colitis 
The median time to onset of any grade diarrhoea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), 
with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 
29 months; 75th percentile: 1 month). Patients should be advised to report any new or worsening 
diarrhea.   
Non-infectious pneumonitis 
Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months (range: 9 days to 27 months), with 75% 
of cases occurring within 9 months. The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of cases 
resolving by 2 months. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duvelisib should be withheld in patients who present with new or progressive pulmonary signs and 
symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline 
by more than 5% in oxygen saturation and evaluate for etiology. If the pneumonitis is infectious, 
patients may be restarted on duvelisib at the previous dose once the infection, pulmonary signs and 
symptoms resolve. 
Severe cutaneous reactions  
Median time to onset of any grade cutaneous reaction was 3 months (range: 1 day to 29 months, 75th 
percentile: 6 months), with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 37 months, 75th 
percentile: 2 months). Severe cutaneous reactions include rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), 
Toxic Epidermal Necrosis (TEN) and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 
(DRESS). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8). In case of 
overdose, general supportive measures and treatment should be provided. The patient should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters, and vital signs.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (Pi3K) inhibitors, 
ATC code: L01EM04 
Mechanism of action 
Duvelisib is a dual inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110δ (PI3K-δ) and PI3K-γ. PI3K-δ 
inhibition directly reduces proliferation and survival of malignant B-cell lines and primary CLL 
tumour cells, while PI3K-γ inhibition reduces the activity of CD4+ T cells and macrophages in the 
tumor microenvironment to support the malignant B cells. At 25 mg BID, the plasma levels of 
duvelisib may not be high enough to cause sustained inhibition of PI3K-γ, and the contribution of 
PI3K-γ inhibition to the efficacy may be limited. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of multiple doses of duvelisib 25 and 75 mg BID on the corrected QT (QTc) interval was 
evaluated in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Increases of > 20 ms in the 
QTc interval were not observed. 
Clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL 
IPI-145-07 
A randomised, multicenter, open-label trial (Study IPI-145-07) compared duvelisib versus 
ofatumumab in 319 adult patients with CLL (N = 312) or SLL (N = 7) after at least one prior therapy. 
Patients were not appropriate for treatment with a purine-based analogue regimen (per National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network or European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines), including 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relapse ≤ 36 month from a purine-based chemoimmunotherapy regimen or relapse ≤ 24 months from a 
purine-based monotherapy regimen.  Patients who received prior BTK- or PI3K-inhibitors were 
excluded from the trial.  None of the patients enrolled received prior BCL-2 inhibitor therapy. 
The study randomised patients with a 1:1 ratio to receive either duvelisib 25 mg BID until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity or ofatumumab for 7 cycles. Ofatumumab was administered 
intravenously at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed one week later by 2000 mg once weekly for 7 
doses, and then 2000 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 additional doses.  Treatment with ofatumumab 
beyond 7 cycles was not permitted, and no patients received more than 7 cycles of ofatumumab.  
In the overall study population, (160 randomised to duvelisib, 159 to ofatumumab), the median patient 
age was 69 years (range: 39 to 90 years) with 68% of patients over 65 years, 60% were male, and 92% 
has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.  61% of patients 
had Rai stage of ≥ I, and 39% had Binet stage ≥ B.  The percentage of patients with unmutated IGHV 
(Ig heavy chain V-111) was 71%.  Thirty-eight percent (38%) received 1 prior line of therapy, and 
62% received 2 or more prior lines.  Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients received prior alkylator 
therapy, with 38% of patients receiving prior bendamustine therapy; 80% of patients received prior 
rituximab therapy.  60% in the duvelisib arm and 71% in the ofatumumab arm had prior purine 
analogue treatment (but were not refractory as defined by IwCLL).  At baseline, 46% of patients had 
at least one tumour ≥ 5 cm, 24% of patients had a documented 17p deletion, 32% of patients had a 
documented 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, and 23% had a documented 11q deletion.  The 
median time from initial diagnosis was 7 years (range: 0.3 to 34.7 years).  The median time from most 
recent relapse/refractory diagnosis was 2.4 months (range: 0.2 to 80.2 months).  The median time from 
most recent systemic therapy was 19.5 months (range: 0.5 to 148.8 months). 
During randomised treatment, the median duration of exposure to duvelisib was 12 months (range: 0.2 
to 37), with 72% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 49% receiving at least 12 months of 
duvelisib.  The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5 months (range: < 0.1 to 6). 
The approval of Copiktra is based on efficacy and safety analysis of patients with at least 2 prior lines 
of therapy, where the benefit:risk appeared greater in this more heavily pretreated population 
compared to the overall trial population. 
In this subset of patients with at least 2 prior lines of therapy, (95 randomised to duvelisib, 101 to 
ofatumumab), the median patient age was 69 years (range: 40 to 90 years) with 70% of patients over 
65 years, 59% were male, and 88% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 62% of the patients 
had Rai stage of ≥ I, and 38% had Binet stage ≥ B. The percentage of patients with unmutated IGHV 
(Ig heavy chain V-111) was 69%. Forty-six percent (46%) received 2 prior lines of therapy, and 54% 
received 3 or more prior lines. Ninety-six percent (96%) of patients received prior alkylator therapy, 
with 51% of patients receiving prior bendamustine therapy; 86% of patients received prior rituximab 
therapy. 70% in the duvelisib arm and 77% in the ofatumumab arm had prior purine analogue 
treatment (but were not refractory as defined by IwCLL). At baseline, 52% of patients had at least one 
tumour ≥ 5 cm, 22% of patients had a documented 17p deletion, 31% of patients had a documented 
17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, and 27% of patients had a documented 11q deletion.  The median 
time from initial diagnosis was 8 years (range: 0.9 to 34.7 years).  The median time from most recent 
relapse/refractory diagnosis was 2.6 months (range: 0.2 to 69 months).  The median time from most 
recent systemic therapy was 15.5 months (range: 0.5 to 107.2 months).   
During randomised treatment, the median duration of exposure to duvelisib was 13 months (range: 0.2 
to 37), with 80% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 52% receiving at least 12 months of 
duvelisib. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5 months (range: < 0.1 to 6). 
Efficacy was based on the primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an 
Independent Review Committee (IRC). Patients on both arms were to continue to be followed for 
disease progression after discontinuation of randomized treatment until initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Other efficacy measures included overall response rate. The efficacy endpoints of 
overall response rate and overall survival were designated as key secondary efficacy endpoints and 
were to be tested sequentially only if the primary endpoint of PFS was significant.

Clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory Follicular Lymphoma (FL) 
IPI-145-06 
Efficacy of duvelisib in patients with previously treated FL is based on a single-arm, multicenter trial 
(Study IPI-145-06). In this study, duvelisib 25 mg BID was administered in 129 patients with indolent 
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL, including: FL, n = 83; SLL, n=28; and marginal zone 
lymphoma [MZL], n=18) who were refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or 
radioimmunotherapy. Refractory disease was defined as less than a partial remission or relapse within 
6 months after the last dose. The trial excluded patients with Grade 3b FL, large cell transformation, 
prior allogeneic transplant, and prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor or to a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor. 
The median age was 65 years (range: 30 to 90 years) with 50% of subjects over 65 years and 14% of 
subjects age 75 or older, 68% were male, and 40% had bulky disease assessed at baseline (target 
lesion ≥ 5 cm). Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range: 1 to 18), with 96% being 
refractory to their last therapy and 77% being refractory to 2 or more prior lines of therapy. Ninety-
eight percent (98%) of patients were refractory to rituximab, and 91% were refractory to an alkylating 
agent. Most patients (approximately 75%) experienced early relapse (no response on treatment or 
progressive disease [PD] or time to next treatment less than 2 years) after their first treatment regimen.  
The median time from initial diagnosis was 4.5 years (range 4 months to 27 years).  Most patients 
(95%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 
The median duration of exposure to duvelisib was 7 months (range: 0.4 to 45.5), with 53% of patients 
receiving at least 6 months and 26% receiving at least 12 months of duvelisib.  
Efficacy was based on the primary endpoint of overall response rate. Secondary endpoints were 
progression-free survival, duration of response as assessed by an IRC and overall survival (Table 5).

Elderly 
Clinical trials of duvelisib included 270 patients (61%) that were 65 years of age and older and 104 
(24%) that were 75 years of age and older. No major differences in efficacy or safety were observed 
between patients less than 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. No specific dose 
adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
duvelisib for the treatment of mature B cell malignancies for all subsets of the paediatric population 
from birth to less than 18 years of age (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Duvelisib exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner over a dose range of 8 mg to 75 mg (0.3 
to 3 times the recommended dose) following a single dose. Dose proportionality was not estabilished 
after multiple doses. 
At steady state following 25 mg BID administration of duvelisib in patients, the geometric mean 
(CV%) maximum concentration (Cmax) was 1.5 (64%) µg/mL and AUC was 7.9 (77%) µg•h/mL. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of 25 mg duvelisib after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers was 42%.  
The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) was observed at 1 to 2 hours in patients.   
Effect of food 
Duvelisib may be administered without regard to food.  The administration of a single dose of 
duvelisib with a high-fat meal (fat accounted for approximately 50% of the total caloric content of the 
meal) decreased Cmax by approximately 37% and decreased the AUC by approximately 6%, relative to 
fasting conditions. 
Distribution 
Protein binding of duvelisib is greater than 95%. The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.5. The 
geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) is 28.5 L (62%).  
Biotransformation 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duvelisib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. The major metabolite is IPI-656, 
which is pharmacologically inactive at clinically observed exposure levels. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean (CV%) apparent systemic clearance at steady-state is 4.2 L/hr (56%) in patients 
with lymphoma or leukaemia. The geometric mean (CV%) elimination half-life of duvelisib is 4.7 
hours (57%) during 0-8 hours postdose. 
Excretion 
Following a single 25 mg oral dose of radiolabeled duvelisib, 79% of the radioactivity was excreted in 
feces (11% unchanged) and 14% was excreted in the urine (1% unchanged). These data have been 
determined in healthy subjects. 
In vitro drug interaction studies 
Duvelisib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP). Duvelisib 
is highly absorbed following an oral dose and therefore no clinically relevant effect of P-gp and BCRP 
inhibitors is expected.  
In vitro studies combined with human in vivo Pharmacokinetic (PK) data suggested that clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions of duvelisib and its main metabolite IPI-656 with substrates of OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, or P-gp are unlikely. Therefore, interaction 
studies with Pgp, BCRP and CYP2C8 are considered not necessary. 
Both duvelisib and IPI-656 were determined as direct inhibitors of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 as well as 
metabolism-dependent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (Please refer to section 4.5). ). Simulations indicated that 
at supratherapeutic doses duvelisib can be a mild inhibitor of CYP2C8, which is considered unlikely to 
result in clinically relevant interactions. 
Special populations 
Age (18 to 90 years), sex, race, renal impairment (creatinine clearance 23 to 80 mL/ min), hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B, and C) and body weight (40 to 154 kg) had no clinically 
significant effect on the exposure of duvelisib.  
Duvelisib pharmacokinetics were highly variable in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment.Geometric mean duvelisib AUC0-∞ in mild, moderate, and severely hepatically impaired 
subjects were lower (within 20%) compared to the exposure observed in healthy subjects and was 
89%, 94%, and 81% of the exposure observed in healthy subjects and is not considered clinically 
significant. The exposures in moderately and severely impaired subjects were highly variable (CV% 
46 – 67%)  and these patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events (see section 4.4). 
Exposures obtained in cancer patients were approximately 2-fold higher than the exposures observed 
in healthy subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and cynomolgus monkey, adverse effects were mainly related to 
expected exaggarated pharmacology, including adverse effects on lymphoid tissues, bone marrow and 
haematology parameters at exposures of free duvelisib at 8 to 16 fold, corresponding to total duvelisib 
at 2 to 11 fold Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 25 mg BID in human. 
Duvelisib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro or in vivo assays. 
In dose range finding and pivotal embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in rat and rabbit, 
duvelisib (free fraction)  induced embryo-fetal developmental toxicity only at free plasma exposures 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
margins of  >25 fold of 25 mg BID in human (MRHD), corresponding to 4 to 5 fold total plasma 
concentrations.  
Fertility studies with duvelisib were not conducted. Histological findings in male and female rats were 
observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies and included testis (seminiferous epithelial atrophy, 
decreased weight, soft testes), and epididymis (small size, oligo/aspermia) in males and ovary 
(decreased weight) and uterus (atrophy) in females. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with duvelisib.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Copiktra is and what it is used for 
Copiktra is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance duvelisib. It works by blocking the 
effects of enzymes needed for the growth and survival of B-lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). 
These enzymes are overactive in certain cancerous white blood cells and by blocking them Copiktra 
can kill and reduce the number of cancerous B-lymphocytes. 
Copiktra is used for the treatment of cancers of B-lymphocytes called  
•  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (or small lymphocytic lymphoma) 
•  follicular leukaemia.  
In these diseases the B-lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live too long, so there are too many of 
them in the blood or lymph nodes.  Copiktra is used when patients have previously been given at least 
2 other therapies that did not work or are no longer working. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Copiktra  
Do not take Copiktra 
- 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking Copiktra. 
if you are allergic to duvelisib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Copiktra, 
- 
- 
- 
if you have an infection. This must be treated before you start taking Copiktra. 
if you have intestinal problems 
if you have lung or breathing problems 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
Infections are common during Copiktra treatment, and can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse right away if you have fever, chills, or other signs of an infection during 
treatment with Copiktra. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine while you are taking Copiktra, 
to prevent certain types of infection. 
Diarrhoea or inflammation of your intestine  
Diarrhoea or inflammation of your intestine (colitis) is common during Copiktra treatment, and can be 
serious and can lead to death. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have any new or 
worsening diarrhoea, you pass mucus or blood when going to the toilet, or if you have severe 
abdominal (stomach area) pain. Your doctor or pharmacist should prescribe medicine to help your 
diarrhoea and check you at least weekly. If your diarrhoea is severe or anti-diarrhoea medicines do not 
work, you may need treatment with a steroid medicine. 
Skin reactions  
Copiktra can cause rashes and other skin reactions that can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist right away if you get new or worsening skin rash, or other skin reactions during 
treatment with Copiktra, including: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Your doctor may need to prescribe medicines, including a steroid medicine, to treat your skin rash or 
other skin reactions. 
painful sores or ulcers on your skin, lips, or in your mouth 
severe rash with blisters or peeling skin 
rash with itching 
rash with fever 
Inflammation of the lungs  
Copiktra can cause inflammation of your lungs which can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist right away if you get new or worsening cough or difficulty breathing. Your 
doctor may do tests to check your lungs if you have breathing problems. Your doctor may treat you 
with a steroid medicine if you develop inflammation of the lungs that is not due to an infection. 
Elevated liver enzymes 
Copiktra may cause abnormalities in blood tests for your liver. Your doctor will check for liver 
problems during your treatment with Copiktra. Tell your doctor right away if you get any symptoms of 
liver problems, including yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice), abdominal 
pain, bruising or bleeding more easily than normal. 
Blood counts 
Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia) and  decrease in red blood cell (anaemia or bloodlessness) 
can occur in patients treated with Copiktra. Both can be serious. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts regularly. Tell your doctor right away if you get fever or any signs of infection, if you feel tired 
or dizzy, or if you have headache. 
If you have any of the above serious side effects during treatment with Copiktra, your doctor may 
pause your treatment, change your dose of Copiktra, or completely stop your treatment with Copiktra.

studied in this age group.

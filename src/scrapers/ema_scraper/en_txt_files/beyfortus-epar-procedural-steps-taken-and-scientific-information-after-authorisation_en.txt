At the time of the original MA, data were available from 
order to update efficacy information based on 
additional results from study D5290C00004 
(MELODY); this is a Phase III Randomized, Double-
blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of MEDI8897, for the Prevention 
of Medically Attended Lower Respiratory Tract 
Infection Due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus in 
1490 subjects in MELODY (Primary Cohort); this was 
approximately half of the planned total study population 
due to an enrolment pause in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Data are now available for an additional 1522 
subjects (MELODY [Safety Cohort]) enrolled after 
recommencement of MELODY following relaxation of 
COVID-19 restrictions, making a total of 3012 term and

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application concerns a generic application according to Article 10(1) of Directive 
2001/83/EC for Pirfenidone AET 267mg, 534mg, 801mg film coated tablets containing the same active 
substance as the originator.  
The reference medicinal product is Esbriet marketed by Roche Registration GmbH and first authorised 
in the European Union on 02 March 2011 as immediate release hard capsule containing 267 mg of 
pirfenidone. In 2017, via a line extension, a new pharmaceutical form associated with three new 
strengths (267mg, 534mg and 801 mg film-coated tablets) were introduced. They form part of a global 
marketing authorisation (EU/1/11/667). The applicant of Pirfenidone AET has applied only for one 
pharmaceutical form, the film coated tablet, with the three strengths (267 mg, 534 mg and 801 mg). 
The mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest 
that pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of in vitro 
systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin- and transplant-induced fibrosis). 
IPF is a chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease affected by the synthesis and release of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-
1β) and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to 
various stimuli. 
Pirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated proteins and cytokines, 
and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to cytokine growth

factors such as, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). 
The indication applied for Pirfenidone AET is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product 
Esbriet: 
Pirfenidone  is  indicated  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  mild  to  moderate  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis 
(IPF). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  267  mg,  534  mg  or  801  mg  of 
pirfenidone as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
tablet core: mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous 
silica, sodium stearyl fumarate; 
film coat: polyvinyl alcohol part hydrolyzed (E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 3350 (E1521), 
talc (E553b), iron oxide yellow (E172) (in 267 mg tablets only), sunset yellow FCF aluminium lake (E110) 
(in 534 mg tablets only), iron oxide red (E172) and iron oxide black (E172) (in 801 mg tablets only).  
The product is available in white opaque High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child-
resistant and tamper-evident polypropylene screw caps or in white opaque PVC/PE/PCTFE aluminium 
blisters, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of pirfenidone is 5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2(1H)-one corresponding to the molecular 
formula C12H11NO. It has a relative molecular mass of 185.2 g/mol and the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
Pirfenidone is white or pale yellow, not hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is sparingly soluble in water, 
freely soluble in ethanol (96%), slightly soluble in heptane. There is only one polymorphic form of 
pirfenidone, designated as Form A. It was shown that no change in the polymorphic form occurs during 
finished product manufacturing and storage. 
As there is a monograph of pirfenidone in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
pirfenidone which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information on the manufacture of pirfenidone has been assessed by the EDQM before 
issuing the CEP. 
The CEP specifies that the active substance (AS) is packaged in a double polyethylene bags (outer black) 
placed  in  a  polyethylene  drum  as  approved  by  the  European  Directorate  for  the  Quality  of  Medicines 
(EDQM) in relation to the Certificate of Suitability.  
According to the CEP, no material of human or animal origin is used in the synthesis of the AS. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The CEP confirms that the pirfenidone is suitably controlled by the Ph. Eur. monograph (no. 
01/2016:2856). 
The AS specification is based on the Ph. Eur. monograph and includes tests for description, solubility 
(Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC and GC), assay (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC). 
In addition, the following specifications parameters are set up by the finished product manufacturer: 
residual solvent benzene (GC) and particle size (laser diffraction). Most of the analytical methods are 
according to the Ph. Eur. Non-compendial methods have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH Q2. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of the AS tested by the finished product 
manufacturer were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
No re-test period is defined in the CEP.  
Stability data from seven commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability batches were tested for the following parameters: appearance, identification, loss on drying, 
assay and related substances. The analytical methods used for the stability testing were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. Results for all tested parameters met the specification at all 
timepoints. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period without special storage 
conditions in the proposed container.

EMA/584774/2022 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Pirfenidone AET finished product is immediate release film-coated tablets containing 267 mg, 534 mg, 
or 801 mg of pirfenidone.  
The 267 mg tablets are yellow coloured, oval shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with approximate 
dimensions 13.2 x 6.4 mm debossed with “LP2” on one side and plain on other side. 
The 534 mg tablets are orange coloured, oval shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with approximate 
dimensions 16.1 x 8.1 mm, debossed with “LP5” on one side and plain on other side. 
The 801 mg tablets are brown coloured, oval shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with approximate 
dimensions 20.1 x 9.4 mm, debossed with “LP8” on one side and plain on other side. 
The finished product has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product 
Esbriet. Consequently, the objective was to prepare a film-coated tablet which is essentially similar to 
the reference medicinal product. 
The different tablet strengths have the same shape (oval and biconvex). However, different strengths 
are distinguishable by the colour, size and debossing on the tablets.  
The excipients used in the product are considered safe in the proposed concentrations. The differences 
from the reference product Esbriet are the presence of magnesium stearate in the tablet core of the 
reference products and the presence of sodium stearyl fumarate and mannitol in the generic products 
which are absent from Esbriet. The coating solution has an in-house specification, but its components 
also comply with pharmacopoeial monographs (Ph. Eur.). All colouring agents used comply to EU No. 
231/2012.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of the AS with excipients was investigated. Results did not indicate any 
incompatibility.  
Polymorphic changes of the AS during tablet manufacturing as well as during storage were studied and 
were evaluated using XRD analysis. No changes were observed.  
The AS particle size can theoretically affect the content uniformity, dissolution and other granular 
characteristics such as flowability. Since pirfenidone is a highly soluble substance (BCS Class 1) a 
specification limit was set based on the PSD range of the tested batches.  
The development of the manufacturing process has been well described. A wet granulation process was 
selected due to the physicochemical properties of the AS. An initial risk assessment of the impact of 
formulation variables on the defined finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) was performed. 
Based on the initial risk assessment, critical process parameters were studied through development 
and optimisation studies conducted on laboratory and industrial scale batches. The impact on all CQAs 
was considered low except for dissolution. 
Design of Experiments (DoE) studies were carried out during formulation development to evaluate high 
risk formulation variables identified in the initial risk assessment. The levels of binder (povidone), 
disintegrant (croscarmellose sodium) and diluent (mannitol) on dissolution was studied. Design of 
Experiments (DoE) studies were also carried out to investigate the optimum range of process variables 
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
and to understand the effect of these variables on drug product dissolution. The experimental design 
selected was the central composite design to screen the variables. No design space is requested by the 
applicant but based on the presented data, optimal quantities for excipients mannitol, povidone and 
croscarmellose sodium, and wet granulation conditions were established.  
The development of the dissolution method has been sufficiently described. The choice of the QC 
dissolution medium was based on the solubility of the AS, the dose range of the finished product to 
ensure that sink conditions are met and PK properties of the AS. The discriminatory power of the 
method was sufficiently demonstrated. 
The applicant has conducted one bioequivalence study (BE) (18-VIN-0385) which demonstrated that 
the test product is bioequivalent to the reference product comparing the highest strengths. It was 
confirmed that the formulation of the test product that has been used in the BE study is the same as 
that intended for marketing. In vitro dissolution results between the test and reference biobatches 
have been provided complementary to bioequivalence studies as per the Guideline on Investigation on 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **. Dissolution profiles were shown similar in all 
tested pH media as required by the above guideline.  
A biowaiver for the two lower strengths, 267 mg and 534 mg, of the finished product has been 
requested. The similarity of the dissolution profiles of the two lower strengths with the 801 mg bio-
batch was confirmed in all tested pHs conditions. All other conditions for the strength biowaiver have 
been met as per the Guideline on Investigation on Bioequivalence. Based on the information provided, 
the biowaiver of the additional strengths is acceptable from a quality perspective. 
The primary packaging is white opaque HDPE bottles with child-resistant and tamper-evident 
polypropylene screw caps, or white opaque PVC/PE/PCTFE aluminium blisters. The materials comply 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The child-resistant cap screws conform to BS EN ISO 8317:2015. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 13 main steps: sifting, dry mixing, binder solution preparation, 
granulation,  drying,  sifting  and  sizing  of  granules,  blending,  sifting  of  extra-granular  materials,  pre-
lubrication, lubrication, compression, film-coating, packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. Critical steps 
have been identified and presented in the dossier and the respective proposed in process controls are 
acceptable to control the process. The proposed holding times are acceptable based on the presented 
hold  time  study  results.  The  container  closure  system  for  the  bulk  tablets  has  been  described  and  is 
acceptable.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. In addition, the 
applicant will to perform the process validation on the first three batches of any further batch sizes of 
each strength of pirfenidone film-coated tablets. This is acceptable considering this is standard 
manufacturing process. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification(s)  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications, include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: description, (visual), identification of AS (HPLC, UV), identification of titanium dioxide 
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
and iron oxide (chemical reaction), water content (KF), dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specifications limits comply with the general requirements of the Ph. Eur. and the ICH 
guidelines ICH Q6A and Q3B(R2) and considered batch and stability results. The dissolution limit has 
been revised during the procedure following a Major Objection raised by the CHMP. The revised limit is 
in line with the biobatch dissolution data provided as per the reflection paper on the dissolution 
specification for generic solid oral immediate release products (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities (Options 2b). The risk 
assessment was carried out in order to demonstrate the worst-case scenario based on a maximum 
daily intake of 2403 mg. Since the total elemental impurity level from all sources in the finished 
product is less than 30% of the PDE (control threshold) in the five commercial batches tested, it has 
been concluded that no additional controls are required in the finished product specification.  
A risk evaluation on the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was provided in line 
with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion 
for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of 
Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk of possible presence 
of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product was identified. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. The nitrosamines risk evaluation 
report is considered acceptable.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
has been presented. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release 
specifications through traditional finished product release testing. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on three commercial scale batches for each strength 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. All the test results were within the proposed specification 
limits demonstrating the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of each strength stored for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in both types of the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. The proposed bracketing approach for post-approval stability studies is considered 
acceptable in line with ICH Q1D.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  water  content,  dissolution,  related  substances,  assay  and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
The results complied with the specifications and no significant changes have been observed.  
According to the EMA “Q&A on Quality of medicines Part 2” if long term and accelerated stability 
studies are not showing signs of deterioration or any stability related indicators, in-use stability studies 
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
do not need to be undertaken. Stability and stress studies do not indicate that the finished product is 
susceptible to deterioration in quality over time. Therefore, it is agreed that in-use stability studies do 
not need to be undertaken.  
A photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B on one commercial scale batch of 
each strength. The test results met the acceptance criteria and no significant degradation was 
observed. Dissolution results met the limits in place at the time However, for completeness, because 
the limits have been revised since then, the CHMP requested the applicant to perform a photostability 
study on one batch during commercialisation and to submit dissolution testing results to demonstrate 
compliance with the tightened dissolution specification limit (Recommendation). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years without any special storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. A major objection that had been raised about the 
specification limit for dissolution testing of the finished product has been resolved by tightening the 
limits in line with existing guidance. All questions have been addressed and resolved. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on 
the benefit-risk balance of the product related to performing a photostability study on the finished 
product and testing the dissolution profile a during this photostability study. This is proposed as a 
recommendation for future quality development (see below). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to perform photostability studies on one batch during commercialisation and to test for dissolution 
during this photostability study in line with revised dissolution specification limit.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as 
the introduction of Pirfenidone AET is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all pirfenidone containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has not conducted any toxicological or pharmacological studies on Pirfenidone 267 mg, 
534 mg, 801 mg film-coated tablet, since this medicinal product contains the same active substance in 
the same concentration as the originator Esbriet 267 mg, 534 mg, 801 mg film-coated tablet, and is 
intended to be substitutable.  
It was therefore accepted that Pirfenidone AET 267 mg, 534 mg, 801 mg film-coated tablets do not 
present any increased risks to the environment than the reference product and that further ERA 
studies were not required, in line with the Guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*).  
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology was provided, and was 
considered adequate by the CHMP. It is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific 
literature. There are no objections to the approval of Pirfenidone AET 267 mg, 534 mg, 801 mg film-
coated tablets from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing pirfenidone. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design 
under fed conditions (study 18-VIN-0385). This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.  
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr **) 
as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the well-established clinical pharmacology, efficacy 
and safety of pirfenidone based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption 
The applicant has conducted one bioequivalence study using the highest strength: Pirfenidone AET 
801mg film-coated tablet and requested a biowaiver for the lower strengths: Pirfenidone AET 267mg 
and 534mg film-coated tablets. 
In accordance with the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**) this is acceptable for products having several dosage 
strengths, in case all of the following conditions are fulfilled: 
a) The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process: Condition 
fulfilled. 
b) The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same: Condition fulfilled. 
c) The ratio between the amounts of active substance and excipients is the same: Condition fulfilled. 
d) Similar dissolution profiles under identical conditions for the additional strength and the strength 
used in the bioequivalence study: Condition fulfilled. 
Furthermore, dose linearity across all strengths must be demonstrated. Upon request by the CHMP, 
evidence of dose linearity across all strengths was provided and was considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, all above-mentioned conditions were fulfilled for pirfenidone tablets to allow 
extrapolation of the results of the presented bioequivalence study on the 801 mg strength to 267 mg 
and 534 mg strengths.

2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 18-VIN-0385: An open label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-
sequence, two-period, crossover, oral bioequivalence study of Pirfenidone Tablets 801 mg 
and Esbriet 801 mg Film-coated tablets (Pirfenidone) of Roche Registration GmbH, Germany 
in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fed condition. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
This was a randomised, balanced, open label, single dose, two period, two sequence, two treatment, 
crossover oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of pirfenidone tablets 801 
mg and Esbriet (pirfenidone) 801 mg film coated tablets (MAH: Roche Registration GmbH Germany) in 
60 healthy, adult male subjects under fed conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the 
rate and extent of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety 
and tolerability of a single dose of pirfenidone 801mg.  
The study was conducted in two periods and in each period; the subjects received either test or 
reference products randomly. 
Subjects were housed in clinical facility to ensure 10.00 hours overnight fasting before schedule time 
of start of a high-fat, high calorie breakfast and continued to be housed in the facility till 24.00 hours 
post-dose blood sample collection in each period. 
•  Test and reference products  
Pirfenidone AET 801mg film-coated tablets has been compared to Esbriet 801mg film-coated tablets 
manufactured by Roche Registration Ltd, UK. 
•  Population(s) studied 
Healthy, willing, male volunteers of age between 18 and 45 (both inclusive) years with a Body Mass 
Index (18.50 to 30.00 kg/m2 (both inclusive)) with a minimum of 45 kg weight were selected on the 
basis of laboratory evaluations, medical history, clinical examination (including vital signs (sitting and 
standing blood pressure, oral temperature, radial pulse rate and respiratory rate), physical 
examination and systemic examination), Chest Xray (PA view) and ECG recordings during screening. 
As per protocol, 60 healthy adult male subjects were enrolled in the study who complied with all the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The study started with 60 subjects and 50 
completed the study. 
10 subjects withdrew from the study for the following different reasons: 
•  2 subjects reported adverse events after the dosing of period 01  
•  1 subject was found positive in drug of abuse test during the admission of period 02  
•  1 subject was found positive in alcohol breath test during the admission of period 02  
Assessment report 
EMA/584774/2022 
 
 
 
•  3 subjects did not report to the facility during the admission of period 02  
•  3 subjects reported adverse events after the dosing of period 02 
•  Analytical methods 
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated analytical test method to determine 
the concentrations of pirfenidone in the samples of all analysed subjects. A detailed description of the 
operative procedures and the validation process were provided and deemed acceptable by the CHMP. 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: 
Primary PK Parameters: Cmax and AUC0-t 
• 
•  Secondary PK Parameters: AUC0-∞, Tmax, t1/2, λz and AUC_%Extrap_obs 
The pharmacokinetic variables were adequate for the study.  
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical tests like ANOVA, least square means for test and reference formulations, difference 
between test and reference formulations, intrasubject variability and power were calculated for ln-
transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for pirfenidone.  
Geometric least square means of test and reference formulations, its ratio, 90% confidence interval for 
geometric least square mean ratio and two one-sided tests for 90% confidence interval limits were 
calculated for pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for pirfenidone. 
A two one-sided test for equivalence was performed to determine whether or not the geometric least 
squares mean ratio of test to reference treatments for ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t lies within 
80.00-125.00%. To be bioequivalent the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least 
square mean ratios (T/R) of Cmax and AUC0-t for pirfenidone should lie within 80.00-125.00%. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed on 50 subjects. 
The appropriate variables were measured, and statistical methodology was acceptable.

•  Safety data 
Pirfenidone tablets 801 mg were well tolerated by the subjects. In total six (06) adverse events were 
reported during the study. Two subjects reported two adverse events (vomiting) after administration of 
the test product (T). Three subjects reported four adverse events (3 vomiting and 1 asymptomatic 
increase in total WBC count) after administration of the reference product (R). No death or serious 
adverse event occurred during the conduct of the study. 
Overall,  pirfenidone  tablets  801  mg  and  Esbriet  801  mg  film-coated  tablets  were  well  tolerated  by 
subjects under fed conditions. 
•  Pharmacokinetic conclusion 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Pirfenidone AET 801mg film-coated tablets is considered 
bioequivalent with Esbriet 801mg film coated tablets.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, the applicant provided one bioequivalence study and literature data on 
clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety, which is considered appropriate for a generic marketing 
authorisation application.  
The bioequivalence study design and sampling periods were acceptable, with an adequate wash-out 
period at greater than five times the t1/2. The sampling frequency enabled an adequate estimation of 
Cmax.  
The study was conducted with the highest strength (801mg) which was safe for use in healthy subjects 
and under fed conditions. This was in accordance with the methods of administration of the reference 
SmPC. The population studied was appropriate and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria were in 
line with the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). The sample size was in line with the calculation provided in the 
protocol. 
The analytical methods used were acceptable and appropriate. The pharmacokinetic variables and 
statistical methods applied were appropriate for a single-dose study. 
The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of test and reference product (least-squares means) 
derived from the analysis of log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t and Cmax were within 
80-125% acceptance range for pirfenidone after single dose administration under fed conditions.  This 
is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr **). 
The two treatments were well tolerated by the subjects (in both periods) enrolled in the study. The 
safety sections of the product information are in line with the ones of the reference medicinal product 
Esbriet. In addition, the list of safety concerns, pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisation measures 
are identical for both products (see section 2.5. ). 
Additionally, the applicant requested a biowaiver for Pirfenidone AET 267mg and 534mg film-coated 
tablets. Initially the applicant stated that the criteria for biowaiver were all fulfilled however there was 
no mention on the dose linearity of pirfenidone across the strengths applied for. Evidence of dose 
linearity of pirfenidone across the strengths was provided and the biowaiver accepted.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Pirfenidone AET 801mg film-coated tablets is considered 
bioequivalent with Esbriet 801mg film coated tablets. 
The results of study 18-VIN-0385 with 801mg formulation CAN be extrapolated to other strengths 
267mg and 534mg, according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6). 
No safety issues have been identified during the bioequivalence study.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of pirfenidone film-coated tablet. The reference product 
Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open-label, balanced, randomised, single-
dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult 
under fed conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Pirfenidone AET met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Esbriet. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 
to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Pirfenidone AET is favourable in the following indication: 
Pirfenidone AET is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of eladocagene exuparvovec in children aged below 18 months have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
There is limited experience in patients aged 12 years and older. The safety and efficacy of eladocagene 
exuparvovec in these patients have not been established. Currently available data are described in 
section 5.1. No dose adjustment should be considered. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of eladocagene exuparvovec in patients with hepatic and renal impairment 
have not been evaluated. 
Immunogenicity 
There is no safety or efficacy data for patients whose pre-treatment neutralising antibody levels to 
AAV2 was > 1:20 (see section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Intraputaminal use. 
Preparation 
Upstaza is a sterile solution for infusion that requires thawing and preparation by the hospital 
pharmacy prior to administration. 
For detailed instructions on preparation, administration, measures to take in case of accidental 
exposure and disposal of Upstaza, see section 6.6. 
Neurosurgical administration 
Upstaza is a single use vial administered by bilateral intraputaminal infusion in one surgical session at 
two sites per putamen. Four separate infusions of equal volumes are performed to the right anterior 
putamen, right posterior putamen, left anterior putamen, and left posterior putamen. 
For instructions on preparation of the surgical suite infusion of Upstaza, see section 6.6. 
The target infusion sites are defined per standard stereotactic neurosurgical practice. Upstaza is 
administered as a bilateral infusion (2 infusions per putamen) with an intracranial cannula. The final 
4 targets for each trajectory should be defined as 2 mm dorsal to (above) the anterior and posterior 
target points in the mid-horizonal plane (Figure 1).

After stereotactic registration is complete, the entry point on the skull should be marked. 
Surgical access through the skull bone and dura should be performed.

• 
The infusion cannula is placed at the designation point in the putamen using stereotactic tools 
based on the trajectories planned. Of note, the infusion cannula is placed and infusion performed 
separately for each putamen. 
Upstaza is infused at a rate of 0.003 mL/min at each of the 2 target points in each putamen; 
0.08 mL of Upstaza is infused per putaminal site resulting in 4 infusions with a total volume of 
0.320 mL (or 1.8 × 1011 vg). 
Starting with the first target site, the cannula is inserted through a burr hole into the putamen 
and then slowly withdrawn, distributing the 0.08 mL of Upstaza across the planned trajectory to 
optimise distribution across the putamen. 
After the first infusion, the cannula is withdrawn and then re-inserted at the next target point, 
repeating the same procedure for the other 3 target points (anterior and posterior of each 
putamen). 
After standard neurosurgical closure procedures, the patient then undergoes a postoperative 
computerised tomography imaging examination to ensure there are no complications 
(ie, bleeding). 
The patient must reside within the vicinity of the hospital where the procedure was performed 
for a minimum of 48 hours following the procedure. The patient may return home, 
post-procedure, based on treating physician’s advice. The post-treatment care should be 
managed by the referring paediatric neurologist and with the neurosurgeon. The patient should 
have a follow-up 7 days after surgery to ensure that no complications have developed. A second 
follow-up visit should take place 2 weeks later (ie, 3 weeks after the surgery) to monitor 
post-surgical recovery and occurrence of adverse events. 
• 
Patients will be offered to enrol in a registry in order to further evaluate the long-term safety and 
effectiveness of the treatment under normal conditions of clinical practice. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Proper aseptic techniques should always be used for the preparation and infusion of Upstaza. 
Monitoring  
Patients undergoing gene therapy should be closely monitored for procedure-related complications, 
complications related to their underlying disease, and risks associated with general anaesthesia during 
the peri-operative period. Patients may experience exacerbations of symptoms of their underlying 
AADC deficiency as a result of surgery and anaesthesia (see section 4.8). 
Autonomic and serotonergic symptoms of AADC may persist after treatment with eladocagene 
exuparvovec.  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Immunogenicity 
Experience with eladocagene exuparvovec in patients with anti-AAV2 antibody levels > 1:20 prior to 
treatment is not available. 
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks occur when there is a tear or hole in the meninges surrounding the 
brain or spinal cord, allowing the CSF to escape. Upstaza is administered by bilateral intraputaminal 
infusion using burr holes, therefore, CSF leak may occur postoperatively. Patients undergoing 
eladocagene exuparvovec treatment should be carefully monitored after administration for CSF leaks, 
particularly in relation to the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. 
Dyskinesia 
AADC-deficient patients may have increased sensitivity to dopamine due to their chronic dopamine 
deficiency. After treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec, increase in dyskinesia have been reported 
in 24/28 patients (see section 4.8). The increase of dyskinesia due to this dopamine sensitivity 
generally starts 1 month after the administration of gene therapy and gradually decreases over several 
months. The use of dopamine antagonists (risperidone) may be considered to control dyskinesia 
symptoms (see section 5.1). 
Risk of shedding 
The risk of shedding is considered to be low due to very limited systemic distribution of eladocagene 
exuparvovec (see section 5.2). As a precautionary measure, patients/caregivers should be advised to 
handle waste material generated from dressings and/or any secretions (tears, blood, nasal secretions, 
and CSF) appropriately, which may include storage of waste material in sealed bags prior to disposal 
and patients/caregivers wearing gloves for dressing changes and waste disposal. These handling 
precautions should be followed for 14 days after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec. It is 
recommended that patients/caregivers wear gloves for dressing changes and waste disposal, especially 
in case of pregnancy, breast-feeding, or immunodeficiency of caregivers. 
Blood, organ, tissue, and cell donation 
Patients treated with Upstaza must not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantation. 
Sodium and potassium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. No interaction is expected due to very limited systemic 
distribution of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Vaccinations 
Vaccination schedule should proceed as normal.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Based on the lack of systemic exposure and negligible biodistribution to the gonads, the risk for 
germline transmission is low. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of eladocagene exuparvovec in pregnant women. Animal reproductive 
studies have not been conducted with eladocagene exuparvovec (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether eladocagene exuparvovec is excreted in human milk. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is not absorbed systemically following intraputaminal administration, and 
no effect on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical or nonclinical data available regarding the effect of eladocagene exuparvovec on 
fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety information was observed in 3 open-label clinical studies in which eladocagene 
exuparvovec was administered to 28 AADC-deficient patients aged 19 months to 8.5 years at the time 
of dosing. Patients were followed for a median duration of 52.3 months (minimum of 3.1 months to a 
maximum of 9.63 years). The most common adverse reaction was dyskinesia; it was reported in 
24 (85.7%) patients and was prevalent during the first 2 months post-treatment.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Dyskinesia  
Events of dyskinesia were reported in 24 (85.7%) subjects (see section 4.4).  
Of the 35 events of dyskinesia, 33 events were mild to moderate and 2 were severe. The majority of 
events resolved in approximately 2 months and all resolved within 7 months. The mean time to onset 
of events of dyskinesia was 25.8 days after receiving gene therapy. Events of dyskinesia were 
managed with routine medical care, such as anti-dopaminergic treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
Titres of anti-AAV2 antibodies were measured pre- and post-gene therapy in the clinical studies. All 
patients that received eladocagene exuparvovec had anti-AAV2 titres at or below 1:20 before 
treatment. Following treatment, most subjects (n = 18) were positive for anti-AAV2 antibodies at least 
once within the first 12 months. In general, antibody levels stabilised or declined with time. There was 
no specific follow up program to capture potential immunogenicity reactions in any of the clinical 
studies, but presence of anti-AAV2 antibodies in the clinical studies was not reported to be associated 
with increase in severity, number of adverse reactions, or with decreased efficacy. 
Experience with eladocagene exuparvovec in patients with anti-AAV2 antibody levels > 1:20 prior to 
treatment is not available. 
The immune response to the transgene and the cellular immune response were not measured. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
There is no clinical experience with overdose of eladocagene exuparvovec. Symptomatic and 
supportive treatment, as deemed necessary by the treating physician, is advised in case of overdose. 
Close clinical observation and monitoring of laboratory parameters (including complete blood count 
with differential, and comprehensive metabolic panel) for systemic immune response are 
recommended. For instructions in case of accidental exposure, see section 6.6.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Enzymes; ATC code: 
A16AB26 
Mechanism of action 
AADC deficiency is an inborn error of neurotransmitter biosynthesis with an autosomal recessive 
inheritance in the dopa decarboxylase (DDC) gene. The DDC gene encodes the AADC enzyme, which 
converts L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) to dopamine. Mutations in the DDC gene result in 
reduction or absence of AADC enzyme activity, causing a reduction in the levels of dopamine and the 
failure of most patients with AADC deficiency to achieve developmental milestones. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is a gene therapy based on recombinant AAV2 vector containing the human 
cDNA for the DDC gene. After infusion into the putamen, the product results in the expression of the 
AADC enzyme and subsequent production of dopamine, and consequently, development of motor 
function in treated AADC-deficient patients. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
L-6-[18F] fluoro-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) uptake in central nervous system (CNS) 
Measurement of 18F-DOPA uptake in the putamen via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
following treatment is an objective measurement of de novo dopamine production in the brain and 
assesses the success and stability of the AADC gene transduction over time. Most patients 
demonstrated small sustained increases in PET-specific uptake. An increase was evident as early as 
6 months, was further increased by 12 months after treatment, and sustained at least for 5 years.

The efficacy of Upstaza gene therapy was assessed in 2 clinical studies (AADC-010, AADC-011). 
Together, these 2 studies included 20 patients with severe AADC deficiency, diagnosed by decreased 
homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and elevated L-DOPA CSF levels, the presence of 
DDC gene mutation in both alleles, and the presence of clinical symptoms of AADC deficiency 
(including developmental delay, hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crisis [OGC]). These patients had 
not achieved motor development milestones at baseline including the ability to sit, stand or walk, 
compatible with the severe phenotype. Patients were treated with a total dose of 1.8 × 1011 vg (N = 13) 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or 2.4 × 1011 vg (N = 7) during a single operative session. The results for efficacy and safety 
parameters were similar between the 2 doses. 
Study AADC-CU/1601 was conducted with treatment from an older manufacturing process. This 
study enrolled 8 subjects and demonstrated similar results with benefits maintained up to 60 months. 
Motor function 
Motor milestone achievement was derived from the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, version 2 
(PDMS-2). The PDMS-2 is an assessment of a child’s motor development up to the developmental age 
of 5, and assesses both gross and fine motor skills, and with items that specifically capture motor 
milestone achievement. The PDMS-2 motor skill items were chosen to determine the number of 
patients who achieved at least the following motor milestones: 1) full head control, 2) sitting 
unassisted, 3) standing with support, and 4) walking assisted.  
Table 5 summarises patient motor milestone achievement at specific timepoints during the first 
60 months following treatment administration and cumulatively throughout the entire clinical 
programme. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 24 months after gene therapy. Not all 
subjects reached the timepoints specified in the Table 5 at the time of data cut.  
Treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec demonstrated acquisition of motor milestones observed as 
early as 12 months post-surgery. Key motor milestone acquisition was continued or maintained 
beyond 24 months and up to 60 months.

PDMS-2 total score 
PDMS-2 total score was measured as a secondary endpoint throughout the clinical studies. PDMS-2 
maximal scores are 450-482, depending on age (<12 months or > 12 months). All subjects treated with 
eladocagene exuparvovec showed increases from baseline in mean PDMS-2 total scores over time, 
with some benefit observed as early as 3 months (Figure 2). At the 24-month timepoint, the least 
squares (LS) mean of change from baseline in PDMS-2 total score was 104.4 points. Improvement 
from baseline in PDMS-2 total score was as early as 12 months after treatment (76.1 points) and was 
maintained to 60 months (108.2 points). Patients who receive eladocagene exuparvovec at a younger 
age demonstrate a faster treatment response and appear to reach a higher final level.

The following data were collected as secondary endpoints in the clinical studies. 
Cognitive and communication skills 
The total language score, subscales of Bayley-III, a standard assessment of cognition, language, and 
motor development for, infants and toddlers (1-42 months of age) was assessed in Studies AADC-10 
and AADC-11. Over time, all subjects showed gradual and sustained increases in mean total language 
score, which is the combined score for receptive and expressive communication subscales. The total 
score of the language subscale is 97. The mean at baseline was 17.70 (N=20). The mean change from 
baseline for total language score was 7.35 at Month 12 (N = 17), 9.87 at Month 24 (N = 15), and 12.60 
at Month 36 (N = 10).  
Body weight 
Sixteen out of 17 subjects (94%) maintained (47%, 8 subjects) or increased (47%, 8 subjects) their 
body weight over a 12-month period based on gender and age specific growth chart. 
Floppiness (hypotonia) limb dystonia, stimulus-provoked dystonia 
Following gene therapy, the percentage of subjects with symptoms of floppiness (hypotonia) 
decreased from 77.8% at baseline (N=20) to 46.7% at Month 12 (N = 17). No subject experienced 
limb dystonia and stimulus-provoked dystonia 12 months post-treatment, compared with 66.7% and 
11.1% subjects at baseline (N = 20), respectively. 
OGC episodes 
Following gene therapy, the duration of OGC episodes, was reduced and sustained over time and up to 
12 months after treatment. The mean time in OGC was 12.30 hours/week at baseline. This time was 
reduced following treatment by 1.85 hours per week by Month 3 (N=16) and by 3.66 hours per week 
by Month 12 (N=6).

The magnitude of the effect of eladocagene exuparvovec on the autonomic symptoms of the AADC 
deficiency has not been systematically evaluated. 
Exceptional circumstances 
This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to 
the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal 
product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become 
available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
No pharmacokinetic studies with eladocagene exuparvovec have been conducted. Eladocagene 
exuparvovec is infused directly into the brain and has not been shown to distribute outside the CNS. 
Distribution 
The biodistribution of the AAV2-hAADC viral vector in blood and urine was measured in subjects 
using a validated real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Subjects treated with Upstaza 
showed no evidence of detectable viral vector in blood or urine at baseline or through 12 months after 
treatment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of eladocagene exuparvovec on 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility. In animal studies, no toxicological effects on 
male or female reproductive organs were observed. 
No toxicity was shown in rats up to 6 months following bilateral infusion into the putamen at doses 
21 times higher than the human therapeutic dose on a vg per unit of brain weight (g) basis. 
Studies in rats showed no viral shedding in blood or any systemic tissues outside of the CNS 
compartment except for CSF at day 7 where it was positive (copies/µg DNA) in the 6-month 
toxicology study. When tested at subsequent time points (day 30, day 90 and day 180) all samples 
were negative.

Draw the full volume of the vial of Upstaza into the syringe. Invert the vial and syringe and 
partially withdraw or angle the needle as necessary to maximise recovery of product. 
Draw air in the syringe so that the needle is emptied of product. Carefully remove the needle 
from 5-mL syringe containing Upstaza. Purge the air from the syringe until there is no air 
bubble and then cap with a syringe cap. 
•  Wrap the syringe in one sterile plastic bag (or several bags based on standard hospital 
procedure) and place in an appropriate secondary container (eg, hard plastic cooler) for delivery 
to the surgical suite at room temperature. Use of the syringe (ie, connecting the syringe to the 
syringe pump and starting priming of the cannula) should begin within 6 hours of starting 
product thaw.  
Administration in the surgical suite 
• 
• 
Tightly connect the syringe containing Upstaza to the SmartFlow ventricular cannula.  
Install the Upstaza syringe into a syringe infusion pump compatible with the 5-mL syringe. 
Pump Upstaza with the infusion pump at 0.003 mL/min until the first drop of Upstaza can be 
seen from the tip of the needle. Stop and wait until ready for infusion. 
Precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product and accidental exposure  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Accidental exposure to eladocagene exuparvovec, including contact with skin, eyes, and 
mucous membranes, is to be avoided.  
In the event of exposure to skin, the affected area must be thoroughly cleaned with soap and 
water for at least 5 minutes. In the event of exposure to eyes, the affected area must be 
thoroughly flushed with water for at least 5 minutes.  
In the event of needlestick injury, the affected area must be cleaned thoroughly with soap and 
water and/or a disinfectant. 
Any unused eladocagene exuparvovec or waste material should be disposed of in compliance 
with local guidance for pharmaceutical waste. Potential spills should be wiped with absorbent 
gauze and disinfected using a bleach solution followed by alcohol wipes.  
After administration, the risk of shedding is considered to be low. It is recommended that 
caregivers and patient families are advised on and follow proper handling precautions of patient 
bodily fluids and waste for 14 days after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec (see

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Upstaza is and what it is used for 
What Upstaza is 
Upstaza is a gene therapy medicine that contains the active substance eladocagene exuparvovec. 
What Upstaza is used for 
Upstaza is used for the treatment of patients aged 18 months and older, with a deficiency of the protein 
called aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). This protein is essential to make certain 
substances that the body’s nervous system needs to work properly.  
AADC deficiency is an inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in the gene that controls the 
production of AADC (also called dopa decarboxylase or DDC gene). The condition prevents 
development of the child’s nervous system, which means that many of the body’s functions do not 
develop correctly during childhood, including movement, eating, breathing, speech and mental ability. 
How Upstaza works 
The active substance in Upstaza, eladocagene exuparvovec, is a type of virus called adeno-associated 
virus that has been modified to include a copy of the DDC gene that works correctly. Upstaza is given 
by infusion (drip) into an area of the brain called the putamen, where AADC is made. The 
adeno-associated virus allows the DDC gene to pass into brain cells. In this way, Upstaza enables the 
cells to produce AADC so that the body can then make the substances that the nervous system needs.  
The adeno-associated virus used to deliver the gene does not cause disease in humans.  
2.  What you need to know before you or your child is given Upstaza  
You or your child will not be given Upstaza: 
- 
if you or your child is allergic to eladocagene exuparvovec or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).  
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
• 
Mild or moderate uncontrollable jerky movements (also called dyskinesia) or sleep disorders 
(insomnia) may occur or worsen 1 month after treatment with Upstaza and last for several 
months after. Your doctor will decide if you or your child needs treatment for these effects.  
The doctor will monitor you or your child for complications of Upstaza treatment, such as 
leakage of the fluid surrounding the brain, meningitis, or encephalitis.  
• 
•  Within the next days following the surgery, the doctor will monitor you or your child for any 
complications secondary to the surgery, the disease, and to the general anaesthesia. Some of the 
disease symptoms may be amplified during that period.  
Some specific symptoms of AADC deficiency may persist after treatment, examples of such 
symptoms may include impact on mood, sweating, and body temperature. 
After treatment, some medicine may enter your or your child’s body fluids (eg, tears, blood, 
nasal secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid); this is known as ‘shedding’. You or your child and the 
child’s caregiver (especially if pregnant, breast-feeding, or with a suppressed immune system) 
should wear gloves and place any used dressings and other waste material with tears and nasal 
secretions in sealed bags before throwing them away. You should follow these precautions for 
14 days.  
You or your child must not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantation after 
treatment with Upstaza. This is because Upstaza is a gene therapy product.  
• 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Upstaza has not been studied in children under 18 months of age. Limited experience is available in 
children above 12 years.  
Other medicines and Upstaza 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. 
You or your child can receive routine childhood vaccinations as normal. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility 
The effects of this medicine on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known.  
Upstaza has not been studied in breast-feeding women.  
There is no information on the effect of Upstaza on male or female fertility. 
Upstaza contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Upstaza is given to you or your child 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Upstaza will be given to you or your child in an operating room by neurosurgeons experienced 
in brain surgery.  
Upstaza is given under anaesthetic. The neurosurgeon will talk to you about the anaesthesia and 
how it will be given.  
Before giving Upstaza, the neurosurgeon will make two small holes in you or your child’s skull, 
one on each side. 
Upstaza will then be infused through these holes into four sites in your or your child’s brain, in 
an area called the putamen. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
After the infusion, the two holes will be closed, and you or your child will have a brain scan. 
You or your child will need to stay in or near the hospital for a few days to monitor recovery 
and check for any side effects from the surgery or the anaesthesia. 
The doctor will see you or your child in the hospital twice, once around 1 week after the 
surgery, and then 3 weeks after the surgery, to continue following up on recovery and to check 
for any side effects from the surgery and treatment. 
If you or your child is given more Upstaza than should be 
As this medicine is given to you or your child by a doctor, it is unlikely that you or your child will be 
given too much. If it does occur, your doctor will treat the symptoms, as necessary.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

with local guidance for pharmaceutical waste. Potential spills should be wiped with absorbent 
gauze and disinfected using a bleach solution followed by alcohol wipes.  
After administration, the risk of shedding is considered to be low. It is recommended that 
caregivers and patient families are advised on and follow proper handling precautions of patient 
bodily fluids and waste for 14 days after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Posology 
Treatment should be administered in a centre which is specialised in stereotactic neurosurgery, by a 
qualified neurosurgeon under controlled aseptic conditions. 
Patients will receive a total dose of 1.8 × 1011 vg delivered as four 0.08-mL (0.45 × 1011 vg) infusions 
(two per putamen). 
The posology is the same for the entire population covered by the indication. 
Method of administration  
Intraputaminal use.  
Upstaza administration may cause cerebrospinal fluid leak post-surgery. Patients undergoing Upstaza 
treatment should be carefully monitored after administration. 
Neurosurgical administration 
Upstaza is a single-use vial administered by bilateral intraputaminal infusion in one surgical session at 
two sites per putamen. Four separate infusions of equal volumes are performed to the right anterior 
putamen, right posterior putamen, left anterior putamen, and left posterior putamen. 
Follow the steps below to administer Upstaza: 
• 
The target infusion sites are defined per standard stereotactic neurosurgical practice. Upstaza is 
administered as a bilateral infusion (2 infusions per putamen) with an intracranial cannula. The 
final 4 targets for each trajectory should be defined as 2 mm dorsal to (above) the anterior and 
posterior target points in the mid-horizonal plane (Figure 1).

After stereotactic registration is complete, the entry point on the skull should be marked. 
Surgical access through the skull bone and dura should be performed. 
The infusion cannula is placed at the designation point in the putamen using stereotactic tools 
based on the trajectories planned. Of note, the infusion cannula is placed and infusion performed 
separately for each putamen. 
Upstaza is infused at a rate of 0.003 mL/min at each of the 2 target points in each putamen; 
0.08 mL of Upstaza is infused per putaminal site resulting in 4 infusions with a total volume of 
0.320 mL (or 1.8 × 1011 vg). 
Starting with the first target site, the cannula is inserted through a burr hole into the putamen 
and then slowly withdrawn, distributing the 0.08 mL of Upstaza across the planned trajectory to 
optimise distribution across the putamen. 
After the first infusion, the cannula is withdrawn and then re-inserted at the next target point, 
repeating the same procedure for the other 3 target points (anterior and posterior of each 
putamen). 
After standard neurosurgical closure procedures, the patient then undergoes a postoperative 
computerised tomography imaging examination to ensure there are no complications 
(ie, bleeding). 
The patient must reside within the vicinity of the hospital where the procedure was performed 
for a minimum of 48 hours following the procedure. The patient may return home, 
post-procedure, based on treating physician’s advice. The post-treatment care should be 
managed by the referring paediatric neurologist and with the neurosurgeon. The patient should 
have a follow-up 7 days after surgery to ensure that no complications have developed. A second 
follow-up visit should take place 2 weeks later (ie, 3 weeks after the surgery) to monitor 
post-surgical recovery and occurrence of adverse events. 
• 
Patients will be offered to enrol in a registry in order to further evaluate the long-term safety and 
effectiveness of the treatment under normal conditions of clinical practice.

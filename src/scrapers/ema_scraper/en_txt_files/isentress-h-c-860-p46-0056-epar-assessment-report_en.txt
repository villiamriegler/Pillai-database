1.  Introduction 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, Merck Sharp & Dohme, is submitting 
the results of the trough concentration substudy, a part of the IMPAACT P1066 protocol. This substudy 
was implemented as a result of a concern raised during review of IMPAACT P1066 study results by the 
CHMP that raltegravir Ctrough values may be lower in some children in the Cohort III age range (2 to < 
6 years of age) than in the other age groups. This study was undertaken via protocol amendment of 
P1066 study, to provide additional data to ensure adequate trough concentrations (≥45 nM) are 
achieved in the paediatric age group. 
The MAH states that the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for raltegravir and 
therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorization at this stage. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Raltegravir is a HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor approved in both treatment- experienced and 
treatment-naïve adult patients. Raltegravir received initial marketing authorization in 2007 in adult 
treatment-experienced and in July 2009 in treatment-naïve adult patients at a dose of 400 mg BID. 
Based on complete 24 week and partial 48 week data from a Phase I/II study in HIV-1 infected 
children and adolescents, IMPAACT P1066 (Merck Protocol 022), raltegravir received marketing 
authorization in the European Union (February 2013) for the treatment of paediatric patients 2 to 18 
years of age.  
2.2.  Scientific discussion 
IMPAACT P1066 STUDY DESIGN SUMMARY 
The overall IMPAACT P1066 trial was a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiretroviral activity of raltegravir in HIV-1 
infected infants, children, and adolescents (4 weeks to 18 years).   The study enrolled 152 HIV-1-
infected pediatric patients ages ≥4 weeks to <19 years of age. All subjects enrolled into the study 
were stratified at screening into one of five age groups, in six cohorts: 
Cohort 
Cohort I 
Cohort IIA 
Cohort IIB 
Cohort III 
Cohort IV 
Cohort V

TROUGH CONCENTRATION SUBSTUDY RATIONALE 
Ctrough (C12hr) has been identified as an important PK parameter for predicting outcome of 
raltegravir treatment. In QDMRK (Protocol 071), troughs <45 nM were more frequently seen in the 800 
EMA/85104/2015

mg QD regimen and were associated with lower virologic responses than 400 mg BID. In IMPAACT 
P1066, Ctrough for Cohort III tended to be lower than other cohorts, with a small number (2) of 
patients having results < 45 nM.  
TROUGH CONCENTRATION SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVES 
At the time of the initial approval of raltegravir in children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, the 
CHMP requested that a trough concentration substudy be performed for P1066 in an effort to further 
confirm the adequacy of the chewable tablet formulation in an additional subset of patients.  The 
substudy was implemented as a result of a concern raised during review of IMPAACT P1066 study 
results by the CHMP. The concern from the CHMP was that raltegravir Ctrough values may be lower in 
some children in the Cohort III age range (2 to < 6 years of age) than in the other age groups. 
The trough concentration substudy was conducted via letter of amendment to the IMPAACT P1066 
protocol. The targeted enrollment for this substudy was 10 patients. The objective was to further 
evaluate trough concentrations (Ctrough) in patients currently 2 to < 6 years of age (irrespective of 
age at study enrollment) receiving raltegravir chewable tablets at the currently approved dose of 6 
mg/kg BID, and thereby provide additional data to ensure adequate trough concentrations (≥45 nM) 
are achieved. 
ELIGIBILITY 
All IMPAACT P1066 enrolled patients who were 2 to <6 years of age when the substudy was 
implemented, and receiving the raltegravir chewable tablet at the approved dose of ~ 6 mg/kg BID 
were eligible. Note that participation in the substudy was voluntary. The substudy was presented to 
the study participants as an opportunity to add important study information/data to the study but 
there was no requirement for the site to participate or the participant to consent for this component of 
the study. Patients enrolled into Cohort IV and V who had reached their 2nd birthday were eligible 
provided that they passed the 48 week time point (to avoid potential confounding with 
primary/secondary study end points) and the individual was been on the chewable formulation for >2 
weeks to ensure that they reached steady state. 
TROUGH CONCENTRATION SUBSTUDY DESIGN 
Subjects enrolled in this substudy had 2 plasma samples obtained to assess trough (C12hr) 
concentrations; the first was drawn following an unobserved dose and the second following an 
observed dose. Sites confirmed before scheduling the PK visit that the patient was receiving the 
currently approved 6 mg/kg BID dose. If a weight-based dose adjustment was necessary, it was done 
at least 2 weeks before the PK visit. All enrolled patients had two blood sample collections, 2 mL per 
sample. On a single study visit day, the patient had two PK samples collected approximately 12 hours 
apart: the first as an unobserved pre-dose sample (C12hr unobserved) sample and the second as an 
observed collection 12 hours after dosing (C12hr observed). The unobserved C12hr plasma PK sample 
was collected between 11 and 13 hours after the prior (unobserved) raltegravir dose, and just before 
an observed dose. The time of the previous (unobserved) raltegravir dose was recorded by the study 
site on the case report form (CRF). The first PK sample collection was scheduled such that the 
witnessed dose of raltegravir on the day of the study visit was as close as possible to 12 hours 
(between 11-13 hours) after the previous unobserved dose. The patient then received a site staff 
administered (i.e., witnessed [observed]) raltegravir dose of 6 mg/kg, and returned to the clinic later 
that day for the second C12hr plasma sample collection, between 11 and 13 hours after the witnessed 
(observed) dose. The second PK sample collection was collected as close as possible to 12 hours after 
the witnessed raltegravir dose. In the event of doses vomited <30 minutes after dosing; PK sample

collection was cancelled and rescheduled. There were no dietary restrictions on the day of the study 
visit.  
Both PK samples from this visit were sent within one week for raltegravir concentration determination. 
All PK samples were registered in the Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) database and sent 
immediately after collection to the Antiviral Pharmacology Laboratory. The study database was kept up 
to date by close tracking of samples. PK sample assays and summary statistics were performed on a 
rolling basis and results were discussed with the protocol team. 
SAMPLE INFORMATION 
Whole blood (2 mL) for raltegravir determination in plasma was collected at trough following an 
unobserved and an observed dose; all samples were collected in K-EDTA purple-top tubes. Samples 
were received from various clinical sites affiliated with the IMPAACT clinical trials group. Blood samples 
were drawn and plasma prepared at the clinical sites. CRFs detailing information such as height, 
weight, raltegravir dose amount, cohort number, the timing of subject doses and blood draws were 
prepared at the clinical sites. No identifying information was present on CRFs. Clinical sites used the 
Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) to generate the Specimen ID, Global Specimen ID, and 
shipping manifests. Tubes were labeled with the specimen ID, global ID, protocol number, draw dates 
and time. Shipping manifests were prepared to reflect the data for shipped samples. Samples were 
then packaged in dry ice and shipped according to the safe handling of biological specimens. All 
samples were received frozen on dry ice and in good condition. 
The first trough samples were received in July 2013 and arrived periodically according to enrollment of 
subjects. The final set of samples arrived in June 2014 and, at that time, the trough concentration 
substudy was closed.  
METHODS FOR PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES 
Due to the sparse nature of the trough concentrations collected in the substudy, they are presented in 
summary statistical and graphical format. All concentration-time results have been internally quality 
controlled by the Antiviral Pharmacology Laboratory and externally quality controlled by the IMPAACT 
Data Management Center (DMC).  
RESULTS 
A total of 11 subjects were enrolled into the trough concentration substudy. One subject (8502049A) 
had the unobserved trough collected at 6.3 hours post dose and the second observed sample was not 
collected. This participant was excluded from the tables/analyses included below. Table 1 below lists 
the concentration results for the remaining 10 participants.

The median trough concentrations were 303.5 nM (134.8 ng/mL) and the geometric mean was 268.4 
nM (119.2 ng/mL) at a mean time of 11.7 hours post dose. Variability in trough concentrations was 
high at approximately 90%, but consistent with prior raltegravir data. Importantly, only 1 (out of 20, 
5%) trough concentration fell below the 45 nM threshold for all samples collected. This occurred 
following the observed dose trough collection.  
Trough concentration data were also examined as observed and unobserved concentration results. 
Tables 2 (unobserved) and 3 (observed) describe these results.

The median trough concentrations for the unobserved and observed groups were similar at 302 and 
309 nM, respectively. The variability, however, was considerably lower for trough concentrations 
collected following the observed dose (50%). This decrease in variability following observed dosing is 
not unexpected and is reflected in Figures 3A (linear scale) and 3B (log scale) below. Where solid 
triangles are unobserved dosing trough results and green circles are observed dosing trough results. 
Dashed lines represent 45 nM. 
The trough concentration data overall are similar to or higher than results observed in previous 
IMPAACT P1066 cohorts and from adult RAL studies. In IMPAACT P1066, the geometric mean C12hr (# 
of subjects with C12hr values <45 nM based on intensive PK) in Cohorts IV and V (ages 4 weeks to 
less than 2 years of age receiving oral granules for suspension) were 108 (0) and 117 nM (1), 
respectively. In Cohorts IIB and III (ages 2 to less than 12 years), where all subjects received the 
chewable tablets, the geometric mean C12hr (# of subjects with C12hr values <45 nM based on 
intensive PK) was 130 (0) and 71 (2) nM, respectively. In Cohorts I and IIA (ages 12 to less than 19 
years), where all subjects received the adult poloxamer film-coated tablet formulation (400 mg BID); 
the geometric mean C12hr (# of subjects with C12hr values <45 nM based on intensive PK) for these 
groups were 333 (0) and 246 (1) nM, respectively.  
CONCLUSIONS 
This report summarizes the results of the Trough Concentration Substudy of IMPAACT P1066. A total of 
eleven subjects were enrolled into the substudy, and 10 subjects were considered evaluable for PK, 
with two trough concentrations collected from each, one following an unobserved dose and one 
following an observed dose. Among the 10 evaluable patients, the median trough concentrations were 
303.5 nM (134.8 ng/mL) and the geometric mean was 268.4 nM (119.2 ng/mL). Only one result (5%)

fell below the 45 nM trough concentration threshold in comparison to 2 subjects in the original Cohort 
III group based on intensive PK.  Overall results are consistent with prior pediatric pharmacokinetic 
results from IMPAACT P10662, and provide supportive evidence for the dosing regimen of 6 mg/kg BID 
of the chewable tablet formulation in children 2 to <6 years of age.  
2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted the results of the trough concentration substudy, which was undertaken 
as part of the IMPAACT P1066 protocol. This substudy enrolled 11 patients 2 to < 6 years of age, with 
eligible samples available from 10 patients. Except one patient, all achieved adequate trough 
concentrations (≥45 nM). There is a lot of variability in raltegravir concentrations between subjects 
and even within subjects for the observed and the unobserved doses. The sample size is also small and 
therefore it is difficult to make any firm conclusions. However it is also noted that one or two patients, 
within the other age cohorts also had lower concentrations. 
Therefore overall, it appears that the dosing regimen of 6 mg/kg BID of the chewable tablet 
formulation in children 2 to <6 years of age is appropriate. 
The MAH should continue to monitor the impact on the safety and efficacy of raltegravir in the 
paediatric population, and also perform if possible, at least sparse PK sampling in any ongoing/future 
studies in the paediatric age group to confirm these findings.   
On the basis of the results of this paediatric substudy, there is no change in the benefit-risk profile of 
Isentress for the existing indications. Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the results of 
this study at present. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation

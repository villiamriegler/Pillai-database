Summary of risk management plan for Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 
mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion (treprostinil) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 
10 mg/ml solution for infusion. The RMP details important risks of Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 
mg/ml  and  10  mg/ml  solution  for  infusion,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised  and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  the  medicinal  product's  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information). 
Trepulmix 1 mg/ml,  2.5 mg/ml, 5  mg/ml and  10 mg/ml solution for infusion's summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how the medicinal product should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Trepulmix  1  mg/ml,  2.5  mg/ml,  5  mg/ml  and  10  mg/ml  solution  for 
infusion should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the 
evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new, or any changes to the current safety concerns will be included in updates of the RMP 
for Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion is authorised for treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  inoperable  chronic  thromboembolic  pulmonary  hypertension  (CTEPH),  or 
persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment (severity classified WHO Functional Class (FC) 
III or IV), to improve exercise capacity and symptoms of the disease (see SmPC for the full indication). 
It  contains  treprostinil  as  active  substance  and  is  given  by  continuous  subcutaneous  infusion  via  a 
subcutaneous catheter using an ambulatory infusion pump. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  the  medicinal  product’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion’s EPAR, including in its 
plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s  webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/trepulmix 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion, together 
with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about the medicinal 
product's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Trepulmix 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml solution for infusion are risks 
that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the 
medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or 
potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of 
Trepulmix  1  mg/ml,  2.5  mg/ml,  5  mg/ml  and  10  mg/ml  solution  for  infusion.  Potential  risks  are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

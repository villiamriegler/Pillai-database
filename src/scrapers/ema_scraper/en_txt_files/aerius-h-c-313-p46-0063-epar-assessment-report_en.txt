1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
It concerns a submission according to the P-46 article of the EU Paediatric Regulation (EC No 
1901/2006) i.e. the results of a clinical study (PN200) in perennial allergic rhinitis conducted in Japan 
with desloratadine in which 82 of the 608 randomized subjects were 12-17 years of age. 
This study is not being submitted in support of a new pediatric indication for DL in the EU. 
1.1.  Steps taken for the assessment 
Start of procedure: 
CHMP Rapporteur’s preliminary assessment report 
circulated on: 
CHMP Rapporteur’s updated assessment report 
circulated on: 
24/04/2014

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure  
PN200 
Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the safety and 
efficacy of desloratadine (DL) 5-mg tablets in Japanese subjects 12 years and older with perennial 
allergic rhinitis.  
Participants: 608 randomized subjects including 82 subjects that were 12-17 years of age. 
Study medication: during the screening period, the subjects took placebo (in a single-blind run-in 
period) for 7 days. After the screening period, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria received study 
treatment orally for 2 weeks in a double-blinded manner. They were randomized to one of 3 
treatments: 
  DL 10 mg once daily (10 mg group) 
  DL 5 mg once daily (5 mg group)  
 
Placebo once daily (placebo group)  
Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), the total of 
the four nasal symptom scores (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching), as assessed 
by the (sub-) investigator at Week 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy Results: Primary endpoint: 
Conclusion on efficacy:  
The change from baseline in the primary endpoint TNSS was comparable between DL 10 mg group or 5 
mg group and placebo group, and no superiority to placebo group was shown for the DL 10 mg 
and 5 mg groups.  
Safety Results  
Treatment period starts from the first dose day of study medication until 14 follow-up days after the 
last dose day of study medication. 
The incidence of adverse events was 13.4% (27/202 subjects) for DL 5 mg group, 14.3% (29/203 
subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 10.0% (20/201 subjects) for placebo group.  
The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 0.0% (0/202 subject) for DL 5 mg group, 3.0% 
(6/203 subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 1.0% (2/201 subjects) for placebo group suggesting that the 
incidence was similar among all treatment groups. 
No deaths were reported.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
One serious adverse event of severe epilepsy was reported in the DL 5 mg group and was not 
considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. 
The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 0.5% (1/202 subject) for 
the DL 5 mg group, 0.0% (0/203 subject) for DL 10 mg group and 1.0% (2/201 subjects) for placebo 
group. The adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation included epilepsy (1 subject in the DL 
5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (1 subject in the placebo group) and urticaria (1 subject in the placebo 
group). All of these adverse events were resolved after discontinuation of treatment. 
Conclusion on safety: 
The safety profile of DL 10 mg and 5 mg administered once daily for 14 days was comparable to 
placebo; they were well-tolerated. 
Assessment of the necessity for an update of the EU SmPC: 
The SmPC already contains the following information in this context: 
 
 
4.2 “There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in 
adolescents 12 through 17 years of age”. 
5.1 “The efficacy of Aerius/Azomyr/Neoclarityn has not been clearly demonstrated in trials 
with adolescent patients 12 through 17 years of age.” 
The results of the study are covered by what is already mentioned in the SmPC about the efficacy of 
desloratadine in adolescent patients. Therefore, it is concluded that no update to the EU is necessary. 
PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

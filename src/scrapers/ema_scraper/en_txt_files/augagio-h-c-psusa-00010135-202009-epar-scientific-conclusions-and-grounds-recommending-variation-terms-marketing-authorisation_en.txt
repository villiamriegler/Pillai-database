Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for teriflunomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of the available data on colitis from clinical trial(s), the literature, and spontaneous reports, 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship and in view of the data on pulmonary 
hypertension from spontaneous reports and the literature and taking into account the already 
established association of these two adverse events with the parent compound leflunomide, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship between teriflunomide and colitis as well as pulmonary hypertension is 
at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing teriflunomide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for teriflunomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing teriflunomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

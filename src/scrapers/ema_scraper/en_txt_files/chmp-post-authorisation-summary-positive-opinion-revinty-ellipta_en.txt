Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Revinty Ellipta 
fluticasone furoate / vilanterol  
On 25 January 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Revinty Ellipta. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Glaxo Group Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to one of the existing indications as follows2: 
“Asthma 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and 
inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short 
acting beta2-agonists. 
•  patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-
acting beta 2-agonist. 
COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with a FEV1<70% 
predicted normal (post-bronchodilator) with an exacerbation history despite regular 
bronchodilator therapy.”  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumococcal disease (PD). Clinical manifestations of pneumococcal 
disease include invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-invasive disease. Invasive pneumococcal 
disease is defined as the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site and can lead to 
meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and septic arthritis. The non-invasive disease 
can present as, e.g. acute otitis media, sinusitis and non-bacteraemic pneumonia.
State the claimed therapeutic indication
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Prevenar 20 (20vPnC). The indication applied for is 
“active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of 
age.”
Epidemiology 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) continues to be a major cause of vaccine preventable PD 
worldwide with considerable morbidity and mortality, in infants, children, and adults, despite the 
significant reduction in burden of pneumococcal disease resulting from implementation and widespread 
use of currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs).
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease 
A global meta-analysis of surveillance data from 42 sites with mature 13vPnC paediatric programs 
estimated that the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes account for ~36% of IPD cases in children <5 years of 
age. Eight serotypes accounted for ~52% of IPD in 13vPnC-using sites, including serotypes
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 8/198
15B/C (9.5%), 12F (5.8%), 10A (5.5%), 22F (5.3%), and 33F (4.3%). In Europe, an estimated 35% and 
33% of IPD in 2019 are due to the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes among children <1 and 1 through 4 
years of age, respectively, based on IPD surveillance from 26 European countries. The most common 
20vPnC serotypes were 8 and 10A among children <1 year of age and 10A and 15B/C among children 1 
to 4 years of age in 2019. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decline in the number of 
IPD cases was observed but IPD rates have rebounded to at or above pre-COVID levels.
Pneumonia 
A substantial burden of bacteremic pneumonia including para-pneumonic effusions and empyemas are 
caused by the 20vPnC serotypes. While the serotype distribution of non-bacteremic pneumonia currently 
cannot be determined due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, evidence of the 
substantial proportion of bacteremic pneumonia due to the 20vPnC serotypes and the impact of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on all-cause pneumonia suggest 20vPnC will likely help protect against 
childhood pneumonia.
Acute Otitis Media
AOM is a common infection in young children worldwide — one of the most common reasons for clinic 
visits and antimicrobial prescriptions in developed countries. The majority of AOM is due to bacteria, and 
among bacterial OM globally, S pneumoniae is one of the most common causes, causing 24% and ~26% 
of cases as reported from studies in the USA and Israel, respectively, during the 13vPnC period. Studies 
in France, Germany, Israel, and USA during the 13vPnC period found that 12% to 31% of acute or 
complicated pneumococcal OM cases were caused by the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes not covered by
13vPnC (Ben-Shimol, Pichichero, JMI, and Kaplan datasets on file). 
Overall
A modelling analysis of 9 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, 
Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) estimated that 1082 IPD cases, 65,124 pneumonia cases, 780,236 AOM 
cases per year in children <5 years of age are caused by 20vPnC serotypes, representing an annual direct 
healthcare cost of approximately €166 million per year.
The 7 additional serotypes were not only selected based on their prevalence in IPD and mucosal disease 
around the world, but also on characteristics that make them medically important, including antibiotic 
resistance (10A, 11A, 15B and the closely related 15C, 22F, and 33F), association with outbreaks (8, 
12F), and a tendency to greater disease severity such as an association with meningitis or higher case 
fatality rates (10A, 11A, 12F, 15B/C, 22F, 33F).
Aetiology and pathogenesis
S. pneumoniae are gram-positive encapsulated diplococci and a significant cause of disease associated 
with mortality and morbidity in children. The capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae play important 
roles in virulence and immune evasion mechanisms and are used to classify pneumococcal serotypes. 
Currently, more than 100 different serotypes have been identified, which vary both by the chemical 
structure of their seroreactive capsular polysaccharides and in their ability to cause disease, with the 
majority of invasive disease caused by a relatively limited number of serotypes.
In a human host, S pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx and can present with a variety of clinical 
manifestations. The clinical forms vary in prevalence, severity, and associated sequelae and can be 
grouped into 2 broad classifications:

invasive disease, such as meningitis, bacteremic pneumonia, or primary bacteremia, and
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 9/198

non-invasive (or mucosal) disease, which includes non-bacteremic pneumonia, sinusitis, and 
AOM.
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
IPD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both children and adults worldwide. Serious 
manifestations of IPD include meningitis, septicaemia and bacteraemic pneumonia.
The most frequent complication of AOM is hearing impairment, which may occur despite antibiotic 
therapy, leading to profound language and cognitive sequelae in the intellectually developing child. Left 
untreated, AOM can lead to perforated eardrum, hearing loss and mastoiditis.
Management
Treatment of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is based on clinical presentation and antimicrobial 
susceptibility data. Most cases with clinical symptoms consistent with IPD require initiation of empiric 
treatment before bacterial culture results are known. Initial treatment generally includes broad-spectrum 
antibiotics that have efficacy against S. pneumoniae as well as other likely pathogens. The increase in 
pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and other commonly used antimicrobial agents complicates 
treatment decisions and may lead to treatment failures with subsequent increased morbidity and 
healthcare costs.
Prevention of PD in children includes universal routine childhood vaccination with PCVs as well as 
prophylactic use of antibiotics and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in special populations 
(e.g., children with functional or anatomic asplenia). Pneumococcal vaccines have shown efficacy and 
effectiveness against invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes contained 
in those vaccines in both children and adults.
Despite reductions in disease due to 7vPnC and 13vPnC, a significant burden of paediatric pneumococcal 
disease remains, with a substantial proportion caused by the 20vPnC serotypes – mainly the 7 additional 
20vPnC serotypes. By 2015, although paediatric pneumococcal deaths had declined by an estimated 51% 
since 2000, S pneumoniae still accounted for 3.7 million cases of severe pneumococcal disease and 
294,000 deaths in children <5 years of age globally.
2.1.2.  About the product
20vPnC is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine modelled after 7vPnC and 13vPnC and contains 20 
serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides of S pneumoniae, each covalently linked (ie, conjugated) to 
CRM197. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are known to generate robust, functional, and memory 
immune responses to the vaccine serotypes, which are not possible with plain polysaccharide vaccines. 
Due to engagement of T-cells by the capsular polysaccharide conjugate, anti-capsular responses are 
elicited, with generation of memory B cells, allowing for an anamnestic (booster) response on re-
exposure. This results in a durable immunity.
Additionally, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines protect against mucosal disease such as non-bacteremic 
pneumonia, otitis media, and to prevent carriage acquisition and reduce carriage density leading to 
indirect protection.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice
Paediatric Clinical Development Program
This application includes data obtained from 5 clinical trials (one Phase 2 and four Phase 3 trials) 
performed in 5156 infants and 831 children ≥15 months to <18 years of age.  The pivotal 
immunogenicity data are from B7471012, conducted in infants vaccinated on a 3-dose (2 infant doses 
and a toddler dose) schedule in Europe. This trial incorporated vaccination windows that span schedules 
of vaccine administration at 2, 4, and 11 months and at 3, 5, and 12 months.
Data from infants vaccinated on a 4-dose (3 infant doses and a toddler dose) schedule are also provided 
from safety and immunogenicity Phase 2 trial B7471003, Phase 3 trial B7471011(pivotal study for 4-dose 
schedule), and Phase 3 safety trial B7471013. B7471013 includes safety data in a subgroup of preterm 
infants born at ≥34 to <37 weeks gestational age. B7471014 provides safety and immunogenicity data in 
children ≥15 months to <5 years of age with at least 3 prior doses of 13vPnC and children ≥5 to <18 
years of age, who all received a single dose of 20vPnC.
During the course of development, the MAH sought regulatory and scientific advice from EMA’s 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). These are detailed below:
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/81062/2020 (Feb 2020)
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following non-clinical and clinical aspects:



The overall clinical development plan for 20vPnC, and agreement that nonclinical and clinical data 
generated to date support initiation of the Phase 3 clinical development program in infants, children, 
and adolescents up to 17 years of age
The proposed Phase 3 clinical development program to support the proposed indication, age range, 
and label wording, including proposed licensure criteria, study designs, endpoints, and safety 
database
The validated Luminex-based assay platform to measure serotype-specific IgG antibodies in serum 
and the proposed IgG antibody threshold values 
Follow-up SA EMA/CHMP/SAWP/583803/2020 (Nov 2020)
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following clinical aspects:


the proposed endpoints for study B7471012 (2+1 vaccination schedule) and handling of failure 
to meet non-inferiority criteria for certain serotypes;
the proposed design of B7471014 and potential Product Information implications if the study is 
successful.
The MAH generally followed the CHMP’s advice regarding the design of pivotal trials. Specifically, the MAH 
agreed to use both response rate and IgG GMC as primary endpoints. In addition, the post-Dose-2 
primary objectives were included per CHMP scientific advice. Nevertheless, the MAH considers that 
responses after the toddler dose (Dose 3) are most relevant for clinical protection and carriage reduction. 
Other aspects that were not followed, including design of the study B7471014 are discussed in the 
respective parts of the assessment report.
PIP
An additional trial which was agreed in the PIP was ongoing at the time of variation submission: Study 
B7471027 - Randomised, active-controlled trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 20-valent

pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) compared to 13-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) in healthy infants from 12 months to less than 24 months of 
age. This trial is supposed to assess whether 1 or 2 doses of 20vPnC to toddlers ≥12 to <24 months of 
age with 2 prior infant doses of 13vPnC can elicit acceptable responses. The last participant visit in this 
toddler trial was in June 2023.
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP
The MAH stated that all studies were conducted in compliance with GCP guidelines and, where applicable, 
local country regulations relevant to the use of new therapeutic agents in the country/countries of 
conduct, including the archiving of essential documents. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
No non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
An overview of the clinical studies included in the present submission is provided in Table 1. No efficacy 
studies were conducted with 20vPnC.
This application is based on the inference of 20vPnC efficacy for the prevention of vaccine serotype-
specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration of non-inferior immune responses to 13vPnC. 
The paediatric clinical development program for 20vPnC includes 4 immunogenicity trials– three Phase 3 
trials (B7471012, B7471011, and B7471014) and one Phase 2 trial (B7471003):



B7471012 is a phase 3, randomized, active-controlled trial conducted in infants and toddlers, 
using a 3-dose schedule (2 infant doses and a toddler dose)
B7471011 is a phase 3, randomized active-controlled trial conducted in infants and toddlers, 
using an alternative immunization series consisting of 4 doses (3 infant doses and a toddler 
dose).
B7471014 is a phase 3, single-arm, single-dose study conducted in children ≥15 months to <18 
years of age. 
B7471003 is a phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind trial in infants, using a 4-
dose schedule
The program also included a randomized active-controlled Phase 3 safety trial B7471013 conducted in 
infants in whom vaccine was administered as a 4-dose series. 
An additional trial (B7471027) in Europe with a 13vPnC control group to describe immune responses after 
1 or 2 doses of 20vPnC in toddlers ≥12 to <24 months of age with 2 prior infant doses of 13vPnC was 
completed in June 2023.  
The clinical development of 20vPnC for paediatric immunization was modelled upon the experience and 
clinical data of 13vPnC. The immunogenicity, safety, and post-licensure data on effectiveness with 
13vPnC are relevant to 20vPnC since the vaccines are manufactured and formulated similarly and contain

the same 13 polysaccharide conjugates.
13vPnC was registered on the basis of immunological NI compared with 7vPnC for the 4-dose regimen 
(and descriptive summary for the 3-dose regimen) and used the percentage of participants with 
predefined (≥0.35 μg/mL) serotype-specific IgG concentrations and IgG geometric mean concentrations 
(GMCs) as endpoints. Real-world effectiveness studies and data from surveillance systems around the 
world following the introduction of 13vPnC have confirmed significant reductions above and beyond those 
observed from 7vPnC in serotype specific IPD, pneumonia and AOM caused by all of the 7 common 
serotypes.
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in support of this application. This is acceptable, as pharmacokinetic studies are not routinely conducted as 
part of the evaluation of vaccines, as described in the CHMP “Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1).
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacodynamic profile of 20vPnC is defined by the immunogenicity profile. 
Given the similarity of 20vPnC to 13vPnC, the clinical development of 20vPnC for paediatric use builds on the record of the safety, immunogenicity, 
efficacy, and effectiveness established for 13vPnC. The formulation, dose of each polysaccharide conjugate, and dosing schedules of 20vPnC have been 
modelled after those of 13vPnC. The overall strategy of the development of 20vPnC was agreed by the CHMP via scientific advice. Specific points which 
were not followed to are mentioned in the respective sections of the assessment report.  Immunogenicity results are described in the Clinical Efficacy 
sections.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 21/198
Mechanism of action
20vPnC elicits a T-cell dependent immune response to induce antibodies that enhance opsonisation, 
phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci to protect against pneumococcal disease. In addition, it leads to 
generation of memory B cells, allowing for an anamnestic (booster) response on re-exposure to the 
bacteria. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology
Human serological responses against Streptococcus pneumoniae were evaluated in support of the 
paediatric clinical evaluation of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) using direct-binding 
Luminex immunoassays (dLIAs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assays specific for the 20vPnC 
serotypes and the cross-reactive serotypes 6C and 15C. Additionally, immune responses in infants/ 
toddlers to specific concomitant vaccine antigens were evaluated using immunoassays.
Direct Luminex Anti-Pneumococcal Immunoassays
The high-throughput multiplex dLIAs used in development of 20vPnC quantitatively measure the amount 
of serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody present in the sample. Three multiplex dLIAs were 
used: the 13-plex dLIA that measures IgG concentrations to the 13vPnC serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F), the 7-plex dLIA that measures IgG concentrations to the 7 additional 
serotypes of 20vPnC (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F), and the 2-plex dLIA that measures IgG 
concentrations to cross-reactive serotypes 6C and 15C. Pfizer’s 13-plex dLIA was validated and then 
bridged to the World Health Organization (WHO) standardised enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) using incurred samples from historical 13vPnC Phase 3 paediatric studies. A second dLIA was 
validated for the 7 additional serotypes (the 7-plex dLIA) and a third dLIA was validated for the cross-
reactive serotypes 6C and 15C (2-plex dLIA), to support Pfizer’s 20vPnC paediatric Phase 3 trials.
In these assays, each serotype-specific pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide is individually conjugated 
to poly-L-lysine (PLL), and the polysaccharide-PLL conjugates are chemically coupled to spectrally distinct 
Luminex microspheres. The microspheres are pooled and incubated with diluted serum samples to allow 
serotype-specific primary antibodies to bind to the immobilised polysaccharide antigens. The 
microspheres are washed to separate non-bound antibodies, and an R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat 
anti-human IgG secondary antibody is used to detect bound primary antibodies on the microspheres. 
Fluorescence values, expressed as median fluorescent intensities, are measured using a Luminex plate 
reader and correlated with the concentration in μg/mL of bound capsular polysaccharide specific IgG 
antibodies according to the reference standard curve. Assay results are reported in μg/mL of IgG 
antibodies.

Although there is no established correlate of protection for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that directly 
predicts protection for an individual, an IgG concentration of 0.35 μg/mL, developed from a meta-analysis 
of results from efficacy studies of 7vPnC and 9vPnC against IPD, is accepted by the WHO and has also 
been accepted by the EMA as a reference level for comparing new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to 
existing ones for the purposes of bridging back to the efficacy demonstrated in these trials. The 
percentage of participants with an IgG concentration of ≥0.35 μg/mL after a series of 3 infant doses, 
measured by ELISA, correlated with the percent of vaccine efficacy of the studies combined (93%). Since 
this concentration (≥0.35 μg/mL) was developed from the 7vPnC data, the applicability of this level to 
other serotypes is less clear. 
Using a Deming regression analysis of the linear relationship between ELISA and dLIA platforms, the MAH 
bridged IgG titres obtained with the company 13-plex dLIA to the titres obtained with the WHO ELISA in 
order to determine dLIA thresholds representing serotype-specific IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL in the 
established ELISA format. The 7-plex dLIA was not bridged to WHO standards. 
To support the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity endpoints, IgG concentrations were classified 
based on serotype-specific IgG reference concentrations as defined below:

Pneumococcal Opsonophagocytic Activity Assays
The OPA assays used in the development of 20vPnC quantitatively assess functional anti-S pneumoniae 
antibodies by measuring bacterial killing in reactions containing serially diluted test sera, baby rabbit 
complement, and differentiated effector cells (HL-60). The OPA titre is the reciprocal of the highest test 
serum dilution resulting in 50% reduction in the number of bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) when 
compared with the control without test serum (defined as the background CFU). Titres from multiple 
determinations per sample are reported as geometric mean titres (GMTs).
Pfizer’s OPA assays for the 13vPnC serotypes were validated previously and have been used routinely in 
support of 13vPnC clinical trials and registration. Similar OPA assay procedures were developed for the 7 
additional 20vPnC serotypes. The OPA assays for the 7 additional serotypes and for serotype 15C were 
validated to support the Phase 3 trials of 20vPnC. 
ASSAYS FOR CONCOMITANT VACCINE ANTIGENS
Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis Hexaplex Luminex Assay (DTP-6 IgG)
The DTP-6 IgG is a direct binding immunoassay that measures IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin (PTx), 
filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN), and Fimbriae 2/3 (FIM 2/3) of Bordetella pertussis; 
diphtheria toxoid (DTd) of Corynebacterium diphtheriae; and tetanus toxoid (TTd) of Clostridium tetani

simultaneously from a single serum sample. It is based on the method published by Van Gageldonk et al.  
The assay has been validated by PPD Vaccine and Biologics (Wayne, PA, USA) through assessment of 
assay specificity, robustness, precision, and linearity.
The purified 6 antigens conjugated to a set of 6 spectrally unique Luminex microspheres (1 antigen per 
microsphere) and serum containing DTP-6 antibody are added into a 96-well plate to form an antibody-
antigen complex. The bound antibody-antigen complexes are detected using phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled 
monoclonal secondary to human IgG. The resulting fluorescent signal from the addition of the secondary 
antibody is measured using a Bio-Plex fluorescence analyser (or equivalent). Antibody titres are 
determined in this direct binding format, where the fluorescent signal from the PE-labelled monoclonal 
secondary detection anti-human IgG1-4 antibody (HP6043) is directly proportional to the amount of anti-
DTP serum IgG antibodies bound to the antigen-microspheres.
For each DTP antigen, binding of the anti-IgG-PE is compared with a reference standard serum using a 4-
parameter logistic regression function.  The reference standard comprises a pool of sera from adults 18–
40 years of age (n=25) vaccinated with a commercially available vaccine, Adacel™ (Sanofi Pasteur, 
Swiftwater, PA) that contains all 6 antigens. The reference serum was calibrated to WHO National 
Institute of Biologics Standards and Controls (NIBSC) 06/140 for 3 antigens (PTx, FHA, and PRN), FDA 
Lot 3 for FIM 2/3, NIBSC TE-3 for TTd, and NIBSC 00/496 for DTd. In routine testing, each assay plate 
contains a reference standard (diluted at 1:25 [1:50 final in plate] followed by an 11-point, 3 fold serial 
dilution), 4 quality control samples (tested as a single dilution in duplicate at 1:1000), and up to 32 
clinical test samples (tested as a single dilution in duplicate at 1:1000, with a retest at 1:10,000 as 
needed).
Anti-Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
The commercially available VaccZyme™ Human anti-Hib ELISA kit, which measures serum IgG antibodies 
specific to Hib, was validated by ACM Global (Fulford, York, UK).
Microwells supplied with the kit are precoated with the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen conjugated to 
human serum albumin. The calibrators, controls and diluted test sera are added to the wells and 
antibodies recognising the Hib antigen bind during the first incubation. After washing the wells to remove 
all unbound proteins, purified peroxidase-labelled rabbit anti-human IgG (γ chain specific) conjugate is 
added. The conjugate binds to the captured human antibody, and the excess unbound conjugate is 
removed by a further wash step. The bound conjugate is visualised with 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine 
substrate which gives a blue reaction product, the intensity of which is proportional to the concentration 
of antibody in the sample. Phosphoric acid is added to each well to stop the reaction. This produces a 
yellow end point colour, which is read at 450 nm.

Assay for the Detection of Antibodies to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
Siemens Healthcare’s anti-HBs2 assay – a double antigen sandwich immunoassay using direct, 
chemiluminometric technology to measure serum IgG antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) – 
was validated by ACM Global (Fulford, York, UK).
HBsAg (ad and ay) are covalently coupled to magnetic latex particles in the Solid Phase. In the Lite 
Reagent, the HBsAg (ad and ay) is labelled with acridinium ester. Nonmagnetic latex particles are added 
from the ancillary well. The sample is incubated simultaneously with Lite Reagent, Solid Phase, and 
Ancillary Reagent. Antibody-antigen complexes will form if anti-HBsAg is present in the sample. A direct 
relationship exists between the amount of anti-HBsAg activity in the patient sample and the amount of 
relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
Poliovirus Neutralization Assay for Serotypes 1, 2, and 3
The poliovirus neutralization assay for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 – based on the neutralization assay described 
in the WHO Manual for the Virological Investigation of Polio – was altered to make it fit for purpose as a 
high through-put assay and validated by Viroclinics Biosciences (Schaijk, The Netherlands).
In this microneutralization assay, a constant amount of virus is mixed with serial dilutions of serum 
samples. If neutralizing antibodies specific for poliovirus are present, the virus is neutralized and its 
cytopathic effect on indicator cells is prevented. Indicator cells in this assay are human epithelial type 2 
(Hep-2) Cincinnati cells. After the incubation period, the presence or absence of viable cells is measured 
by adding cell viability marker WST-8 and measuring the optical density at 450 nm using a microplate 
reader. The presence or absence of cells can also be assessed by crystal violet staining. The 
neutralization GMTs are estimated from the proportion of virus-positive and virus-negative wells in the 
serum dilution series by the Spearman-Karber method.
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Quantitative IgG Assays
The LIAISON® MMR and VZV quantitative IgG immunoassays, developed and manufactured by DiaSorin 
(Saluggia, Italy), measure specific IgG to MMR and VZV through indirect chemiluminescence. All 4 assays 
were validated independently by Pfizer by performing a descriptive assessment of precision and dilutional 
linearity.
Each of the 4 assays are performed independently on the LIAISON® XL analyser. The critical components 
of each test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with recombinant antigen, or purified viral 
particles, and a mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody linked to an isoluminol derivative 
(isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first incubation step of the assay, IgG specific to the 
respective virus present in calibrators, test samples, or controls, binds to the solid phase. Next, during 
the second incubation, the isoluminol-antibody conjugate reacts with virus-specific IgG bound to the solid 
phase. After each incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, starter 
reagents are added and a chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The chemiluminescence signal is 
proportional to the amount of bound isoluminol-antibody conjugate and is measured by a photomultiplier. 
A signal is measured as RLUs. RLU results are read off a calibrated standard curve and expressed in 
Arbitrary Unit/mL (AU/mL) for measles and mumps, International Unit/mL (IU/mL) for rubella, and milli 
International Unit/mL (mIU/mL) for varicella assays. The positivity cut-off, or minimum result that is 
considered indicative of exposure to virus or previous vaccination and considered adequate laboratory 
evidence of immunity, as published by DiaSorin are as follows for each antigen:

Bridging
The MAH used high-throughput multiplex dLIAs to measure the amount of serotype-specific 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in study participants. 
The MAH provided a formal bridging study report (VR-VTR-10106) for the 13 serotypes shared with 
13vPnC as requested in the first round of assessment. Residual sera obtained from various 13vPnC 
clinical studies, including pivotal licensure studies were tested with dLIA and results were bridged to the 
original ELISA results using Deming regression. Different reference standards were used in the dLIA and 
the historical ELISA data. This approach raises some concerns since the quality of sera might be different 
after years of storage (evaporation, freeze/thaw, etc.). For instance, evaporation over years could lead to 
higher antibody concentrations in the sera which might also explain the greater dynamic range of dLIA 
observed by the MAH: “The 13-plex dLIA platform is better in differentiating pre- and post- immunization 
samples for all serotypes because the dLIA provides a more specific measurement of IgG antibody 
concentrations especially at the lower end of the assay ranges.” Therefore, an investigation of 13-plex 
dLIA/ELISA concordance should ideally not only be performed on the same sera but should also be 
performed in a temporally related manner using the same standards. Aside from such concerns however, 
multiplex dLIAs can be considered in general as valuable tools to investigate serum IgG responses to 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and the number of enclosed samples and the linearity shown is 
considered sufficient for bridging purposes.
In the present bridging report, the serum selection focused on time points one month after the infant 
immunization series and one month after the toddler dose. Panels D1/D2 and D3/D4 represent pairs of 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 27/198
infant pre-/post immunization samples. Two panels (E1 and E2) from the “before toddler dose” time point 
were included to add serum samples with lower serum IgG concentrations. Overall, 1,528 samples with 
sufficient remaining volume were analyzed in the dLIA platform. The selection of sera is considered 
appropriate.
However, despite comprehensive analyses the validity and clinical relevance of the proposed dLIA 
thresholds for endpoint evaluation remain unclear: 
First, regarding the 13 shared serotypes the MAH states within the Response: “(…) Equivalent IgG 
threshold values by dLIA for serotypes 5, 6B and 19A were shown to be 0.23, 0.10 and 0.12 μg/mL, 
respectively. Although 8 of the remaining 10 serotypes bridged to dLIA values below 0.35 μg/mL, MAH 
chose to take a conservative approach and use 0.35 μg/mL for the dLIA for the remaining serotypes (…)”. 
This latter notion is inconsistent with data provided in Table 3 of the bridging report (see below) showing 
6 of the 9 of the remaining serotypes to be >0.35 μg/mL. The assessment will focus on data as presented 
in the formal bridging report.
Table 3.
Second, despite comprehensive quantitative bridging experiments, the MAH proposes a 
threshold of 0.35 μg/mL irrespective of the bridging result for 17/20 serotypes contained in 20vPnC. 
According to the quantitative analyses in the formal bridging report, 7/13 shared serotypes and 11/20 
serotypes contained in 20vPnC were bridged >0.35 μg/mL with 12F (0.69 μg/mL) and 15B (0.57 μg/mL) 
showing substantially higher thresholds. 
The serotype-specific serum IgG antibody threshold of 0.35 µg/mL, based on ELISA, is meant to be a 
population level cutoff value, and not meant for individual subjects or samples. The key reasons for the 
acceptance of the WHO ELISA and the 0.35 µg/mL cutoff value as a correlate for clinical efficacy in a 
vaccinated population are 1) the ability of WHO ELISA to differentiate the pre- and post-immunization 
populations, and 2) the fact that the difference between the pre- and post-immunization populations in 
the percentages above the WHO ELISA-based cutoff value of 0.35 µg/mL can be linked directly to efficacy 
against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Hence, only the ELISA threshold of 0.35 µg/mL can be 
related to a clinical outcome. Accordingly, threshold values obtained with dLIA should at least reflect 
≥0.35 µg/mL in ELISA.
According to the MAH: “Maintaining the original ELISA-based protective threshold cutoff value of 0.35 
µg/mL in the dLIA platform for serotypes 1, 3, 4, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F does not affect the 
vaccine responder rate. For serotypes 5, 6B, and 19A, lower cutoff values are needed for the dLIA 
platform to match the proportions of vaccine responders to those determined by ELISA. Cutoff values of 
0.23, 0.10, and 0.12 µg/mL for serotypes 5, 6B, and 19A, respectively, are recommended for the dLIA 
platform to best match the vaccine responder rates established by the ELISA platform”. Although 
responder rates might not be substantially overestimated using the 0.35 µg/mL thresholds for serotypes 
1, 3, 4, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F according to the MAH´s analyses, best consistency of vaccine 
responder proportions between both assay platforms, can be generally expected from exploiting the 
linearity of the bridging experiment and apply resulting serotype-specific thresholds directly.
Third, the MAH also provided novel evaluations based on residual study sera to investigate the 
concordance between dLIA and ELISA results for the 7 additional serotypes. Such experiments could 
provide valuable insights into the connection between dLIA and ELISA data for the 7 additional serotypes. 
However, as for the 13 shared serotypes, dLIA and ELISA assay were not run in parallel. Sera of the 
20vPnC study B7471003 were retested using ELISA and data were compared to data originally obtained 
with dLIA. Values corresponding to 35 μg/mL by ELISA were estimated as follows: 8, 0.41 μg/mL; 10A, 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 28/198
 
0.21 μg/mL; 11A, 0.40 μg/mL; 12F, 0.69 μg/mL; 15B, 0.57 μg/mL; 22F, 0.27 μg/mL; 33F, 0.28 μg/mL. 
Since there is no link to clinical efficacy regarding antibody titers in any assay platform, the clinical 
relevance of threshold titers for the 7 additional serotypes will be unclear in any case, irrespective of 
whether thresholds would be obtained through quantitative bridging or would be arbitrarily selected (35 
μg/mL).
Different dLIAs (7-plex; 13-plex) were used to determine antibody responses against the 20 serotypes 
contained 20vPnC. 
However, in line with general considerations regarding the setup and function of Luminex assays, the 
described influence of small amounts of polysaccharides on assay performance imply that no quantitative 
comparison is possible between results derived from different dLIA setups (7-plex;13-plex) containing 
much larger amounts of different antigens.
The MAH provided a comparison of mean IgG results by serotype between single and multiplex IgG 
dLIAs. Although the additional effort is appreciated, this approach is not addressing the initial concern of 
the CHMP regarding the influence of specific mixtures (i.e. 7-plex vs 13-plex) of antigens on serotype-
specific assay results. 
Furthermore, the MAH employed Pneumococcal Opsonophagocytic Activity Assays to determine serotype-
specific antibody responses. Such assays can indicate immunogenicity from a more functional perspective 
than binding assays such as dLIA. However, OPA assays are not standardized and do not yield an 
established correlate of protection in the paediatric population.
Experimental approaches to determine concomitant vaccine responses were adequate and equally applied 
to 13vPnC and 20vPnC groups. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Following licensure of 13vPnC vaccine, the MAH changed the IgG assessment assay platform from ELISA 
to a multiplex dLIA platform which allows many tests concurrently on a single assay plate (many 
serotypes assessed in one reaction volume). Subsequently, a multiplex dLIA for the 7 additional 
serotypes was developed and both multiplex assays were used to define serotype-specific antibody 
responses following vaccination with 20vPnC in the current Variation. 
Although the multiplex dLIAs are in principle fit for purpose, proposed analyses show several limitations 
which might also impact important conclusions on primary endpoints.
Issues with assays/data usage (in context of the performed analyses and conclusions)
13 shared serotypes: 
A formal bridging report comparing the used dLIA platform to the WHO ELISA platform was provided on 
request. Overall, the report indicates that the 13-plex dLIA platform is a suitable alternative to the WHO 
ELISA platform for measuring serotype-specific serum IgG responses to pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines.
Despite comprehensive quantitative bridging experiments, the MAH proposes a threshold of 0.35 μg/mL 
irrespective of the bridging result for 17/20 serotypes contained in 20vPnC. Best consistency of vaccine 
responder proportions between both assay platforms can be generally expected from exploiting the 
linearity of the bridging experiment and apply resulting serotype-specific thresholds directly. Therefore, to 
address the uncertainties regarding the clinical relevance of the applied thresholds respective analyses for 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 29/198
the endpoint response rate after the last infant dose and after the toddler dose were requested. Although 
the numbers changed slightly the overall conclusions were not affected by different thresholds. 
OPA titres are not an established correlate of protection in the paediatric population but can serve as 
measure of immunogenicity when presented as fold change.
7 additional serotypes: 
The 7-plex dLIA is not bridged to the WHO ELISA since no data for these serotypes are available in this 
format. A dLIA IgG cutoff of ≥0.35 μg/mL is arbitrarily used as (protective) threshold without direct link 
to clinically relevant data obtained via a standardized assay platform.
The MAH also provided novel evaluations based on residual study sera to investigate the concordance 
between dLIA and ELISA results for the 7 additional serotypes. Since there is no link to clinical efficacy 
regarding antibody titres in any assay platform, the clinical relevance of threshold titres for the 7 
additional serotypes will be unclear in any case, irrespective of whether thresholds would be obtained 
through quantitative bridging or would be arbitrarily selected (35 μg/mL). 
In addition, two different assays (13-plex dLIA and 7-plex dLIA) were used to obtain antibody titres for 
the 13 serotypes also contained in 13vPnC and the 7 additional serotypes, respectively. This design does 
not allow any quantitative comparisons between the two sets of serotypes since the influence of specific 
serotype combinations on the dLIA measurement of serotype-specific IgG concentrations is unclear. 
Accordingly, the determination of NI for the 7 additional serotypes against the (lowest) titre elicited by 
the 13 shared serotypes is not informative. To allow meaningful comparison of antibody responses 
between the two serotype sets, measurement of antibody concentrations in one assay would have been 
required. The current approach limits the interpretation of titres for the 7 additional serotypes in 
comparison to that of the 13 shared serotypes. 
The bridging report revealed that regression-derived dLIA thresholds for responder rate 
evaluation are used only for 3/13 serotypes in the initially submitted study reports. This is not 
acceptable since best concordance with the protective 0.35 µg/ml ELISA threshold can be generally 
expected from directly exploiting the quantitative regression analyses. Additionally requested sensitivity 
analyses with regression-derived thresholds revealed only minor differences and no impact to the overall 
conclusions regarding responder-rate-based endpoints. The SmPC has been updated accordingly.
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The Applicant applied a dLIA platform assay to estimate IgG titres in all presented studies instead of the 
WHO standard ELISA. Although a bridging report and a rationale for the subsequent changes to the 
obtained bridged values were submitted, the CHMP did not agree with the chosen values. Although 
requested sensitivity analyses did not affect the overall conclusions based on the of affected responder 
rate endpoints in the respective studies, relevant tables and the SmPC have been updated to reflect the 
responder rates with the most adequate thresholds. 
Overall, direct comparisons between the approved 13vPnC and 20vPnC, using serotype-specific antibody 
concentrations and fold changes, obtained by identical assays, allow an estimation of immunogenicity for 
the 13 serotypes. Endpoints and non-inferiority evaluations based on such analyses are considered 
clinically meaningful.
Two different assays were used to obtain antibody titres for the 13 shared serotypes and the 7 additional 
serotypes. This design does not allow any quantitative comparisons between the two sets of serotypes 
since the influence of specific serotype combinations on the dLIA measurement of serotype-specific IgG 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 30/198
concentrations is unclear. Together with the lack of a correlate of protection for the 7 additional serotypes 
or any clinical data in this regard, the determination of NI for the 7 additional serotypes against the 
(lowest) titre elicited by the 13 shared serotypes is considered rather uninformative. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy
No efficacy studies have been performed with 20vPnC; efficacy is inferred based on immunogenicity. 
Immunogenicity has been investigated in 4 clinical studies in total, specifically in three phase 3 clinical 
studies (B7471012, B7471011 and B7471014) and one phase 2 clinical study (B7471003). Studies 
B7471012 (2+1 dose regimen) and B7471011 (3+1 dose regimen) are considered pivotal as they provide 
the main evidence for immunogenicity and safety in the target population.
B7471014 is a single-arm trial which evaluated immunogenicity of a single dose of 20vPnC administered 
to participants ≥15 months to <5 years of age previously immunized with 13vPnC and participants ≥5 
years to <18 years of age (regardless of previous vaccination with 7vPnC or 13vPnC) with respect to the 
7 additional serotypes.
The primary objectives for the immunogenicity assessment of the Phase 3 trials were:

To demonstrate that immune responses for the 13 serotypes in the 20vPnC are non-inferior to 
those of the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC group and for the 7 additional serotypes are 
non-inferior to the lowest among the 13 serotypes in the 13vPnC group (B7471012 and 
B7471011)

To demonstrate that immune responses to specific concomitant vaccine antigens when co-
administered with 20vPnC are non-inferior to the corresponding responses when co-administered 
with 13vPnC in infants (B7471012 and B7471011)

To demonstrate that a single dose of 20vPnC administered to participants ≥15 months to <5 
years of age previously immunized with 13vPnC and to participants 5 years to <18 years of age 
elicits immune responses expected to provide protection against pneumococcal disease due to the 
7 additional serotypes (B7471014)
2.4.1.  Main studies
Study B7471012, investigating the 2+1 vaccination regimen and study B7471011, investigating the 3+1 
vaccination regimen provide the main evidence for immunogenicity and safety in the target paediatric 
population.
B7471012: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 
20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Given as a Series of 2 Infant Doses and 1 Toddler Dose in 
Healthy Infants
B7471012 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in healthy infants when administered as a series of 2 
infant doses and 1 toddler dose (at 2, 4, and 11-12 months of age). This trial was designed to provide 
non-inferiority (NI) comparisons of the 20vPnC immune responses with those of 13vPnC to infer 
effectiveness in infants for the 2+1 vaccination schedule. Data were also generated on key routine 
paediatric vaccines given concomitantly with 20vPnC or 13vPnC.

1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine) at enrolment following a 2+1 schedule 
(Doses 1, 2, and 3). Participants received the same vaccine (either 20vPnC or 13vPnC) for all 3 doses. 
The planned duration of study participation was approximately 11 months for each participant. The trial 
was performed at 59 sites in the EU and Australia and was planned to include approximately 1200 
infants.
A separate cohort of approximately 60 infants from Russia was added to the trial for regulatory purposes 
for the Eurasian Economic Region. Dosing in that cohort is currently in progress and was not designed to 
be included in the main analysis and not part of this Type II variation. The Russian cohort was not 
included in the primary study population due to planned earlier completion of study visits in the primary 
study population than the Russian cohort and differences in concomitant vaccine schedule and visit 
windows in the Russian participants.

Treatments
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC in a 3-dose vaccination 
schedule at roughly 2-3, 4-5, and 11-12 months of age (hereafter known as a 2+1 schedule). Participants 
received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 20vPnC or 13vPnC IM into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg 
at each vaccination visit (Doses 1, 2, and 3 at Visits 1, 2, and 4, respectively). The same vaccine (20vPnC 
or 13vPnC) was administered for all 3 doses.
Concomitant vaccines
Participants were also to receive 1 dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) concomitantly with 
all doses of 20vPnC or 13vPnC (Doses 1, 2, and 3 at Visits 1, 2, and 4, respectively). Participants also 
were to receive MMR (M-M-RVAXPRO) and varicella (Varilrix) vaccines concomitantly with booster dose of 
20vPnC or 13vPnC were also (Dose 3 at Visit 4). The MMR and varicella vaccines were intended to be 
given to all participants. However, some countries and sites did not administer MMR and varicella 
vaccines as concomitant study vaccines at Dose 3 due to local practices/recommendations. If they were 
not given at Dose 3, they were to be considered non-study vaccines. All concomitant vaccinations were to 
be administered into a limb other than the left leg (the site of 20vPnC or 13vPnC injection).
Other concomitant medications
The use of prophylactic antipyretic/pain medication, while permitted, was not recommended on the day of 
investigational product administration (before or after vaccination). If symptoms develop, the use of 
antipyretic/pain medication was allowed.

participants with predefined serotype-
specific IgG concentrations for all 7 
additional serotypes in the 20vPnC group 
are non-inferior to the lowest among the 13 
serotypes* in the 13vPnC group at 1 month 
after Dose 2.
*If the lowest percentage in the 13vPnC group 
is from serotype 3, the next lowest percentage 
in the 13vPnC group will be used in the 
comparison. Historical data suggest that 
serotype 3 behaves somewhat differently from 
the other serotypes in 13vPnC; therefore, IgG 
results from serotype 3 will not be used in the 
comparison to assess the NI of the 7 additional 
serotypes.

Sample size
The sample size of the study was determined primarily based on considerations of 1) accumulating a 
sufficient overall safety database for the 20vPnC infant clinical development program, 
2) providing robust assessment of the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 20vPnC and 13vPnC, 
3) ensuring robust assessment to demonstrate that the immune responses induced by concomitant 
vaccine antigens given with 20vPnC are non-inferior to immune responses induced by concomitant 
vaccine antigens given with 13vPnC, and 4) practical constraints of available serum volumes from 
individual study participants with all planned immunogenicity assessments.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 38/198
The study power for the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives was assessed based on 
simulations of multivariate log-normal distributed random numbers with assumptions supported by IgG 
results after 2 and/or 3 infant doses from historical 13vPnC and 7vPnC infant studies, and IgG results 
after 3 infant doses and the toddler dose of an internal Phase 2 infant study of 20vPnC (B7471003). To 
accommodate the uncertainties in the assumptions, 3 different assumed GMRs of the 20vPnC to the 
13vPnC group 1 month after Dose 2 were explored to evaluate the study power.
With approximately 1200 enrolled participants using a 1:1 randomization ratio, assuming a 10% 
nonevaluable rate at 1 month after Dose 2, and a 17% nonevaluable rate at 1 month after Dose 3, the 
study was expected to result in approximately 540 and 500 evaluable participants for each vaccine group 
at 1 month after Dose 2 and 1 month after Dose 3, respectively. Dependent on the different IgG GMR 
assumptions, it was estimated that the study had a power of at least 85% when redefining study success 
to show NI in at least 47 (out of 60 total primary) NI assessments. Thereby, NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for 
percentages of participants with the predefined IgG concentration results for a serotype was considered 
to be met if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages 
was greater than –10%. NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for serotype-specific IgG GMCs for a serotype as 
considered to be met if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) was 
greater than 0.5.
This sample size was considered suitable to also have sufficient power for all NI tests for the (coprimary) 
concomitant immunogenicity objective, as well as for the primary safety objective.
Randomisation
All eligible participants were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. 
Allocation of participants to vaccine groups was planned to proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology (IRT) system (interactive Web-based response [IWR]). 
The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) was planned to be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, 
and the participant number. The site personnel were to be provided with a vaccine assignment, 
randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container numbers when investigational product was 
supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system was supposed to provide a confirmation report containing 
the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container numbers assigned. The confirmation 
report was to be stored in the site’s files.
Blinding (masking)
The study was planned to be participant- and investigator-blinded. Sponsor personnel and investigators 
involved in evaluating participant data in the primary study population were planned to be blinded to 
vaccine assignment until the analysis at the completion of the primary study population. Laboratory 
personnel performing the assays were planned to remain blinded until all assays were completed and 
assay results finalized. Standard proceedings for blind breaking during study conduct were put in place 
with the study protocol.

Statistical methods
Unless otherwise stated, the descriptive statistics for continuous variables were n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (e.g. 
proportions) were the percentage (%), the numerator (n) and the denominator (N) used in the 
percentage calculation, and the 95% CIs where applicable. 
All baseline characteristics including demographic data, medical history and participants’ disposition and 
compliance were planned to be analysed in descriptive manner. Subset analyses were planned to be done 
in descriptive manner, separately by sex and in countries where sufficient numbers were present for the 
critical safety and immunogenicity endpoints.
In general, standard statistical methodology for reporting all safety data was planned to be used. Details 
regarding the local tolerance and safety data analyses had been prespecified in the SAP.   
Analysis sets
For purposes of analysis, the following participant populations were to be defined:

Safety
Description
All participants who receive at least 1 dose of the investigational 
product and have safety data assessed after any dose. Participants 
will be grouped according to the vaccine as administered in the safety 
analysis.
Safety data after Dose 3 will be summarized for participants in the 
safety population who receive Dose 3 with safety follow-up after Dose 
3.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 41/198
For the Dose 2 and Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population definitions, the blood collection window 
has been expanded by 1 extra day before and 14 days after the protocol-specified blood collection 
window of 28 to 42 days defined in the protocol, for consistency with established rules in the 13vPnC 
development program. 
The major protocol deviations were to be determined by clinical review or medical monitor. A major 
protocol deviation was a protocol deviation that, in the opinion of the sponsor’s clinician, would materially 
affect assessment of immunogenicity, eg, participant receipt of a prohibited vaccine or medication that 
might affect immune response or a medication error with a suspected decrease in potency of the vaccine. 
The sponsor’s clinician was to identify those participants with major protocol deviations before any 
unblinded analysis.
It was planned that if there were less than a 10% difference in the total number of participants between 
the all-available and evaluable immunogenicity population, only the evaluable immunogenicity population 
was to be used for the analysis of immunogenicity results.
Immunogenicity analyses
The estimands to evaluate the immunogenicity objectives for NI were planned to be based on evaluable 
populations. These estimands were supposed to estimate vaccine effect in the hypothetical setting where 
participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. The estimand addressed 
the objective of estimating the maximum potential difference between 2 groups, since the impact of 
noncompliance was considered likely to diminish the observed difference between the 2 groups.
Empirical Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves (RCDCs) were to be plotted as a step function of 
proportion of participants with assay results equal to or exceeding a specified value over the full range of 
the observed assay results.
For immunogenicity results of IgG concentrations, OPA titres, and the antibody levels of the concomitant 
vaccines, geometric means (GMs) were to be computed along with associated 95% CIs. The GMs and the 
95% CIs were planned to be calculated as the means and the CIs of the assay results on the natural log 
scale and then exponentiating the results. Two-sided 95% CIs were to be calculated based on the t-
distribution.
Where appropriate, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and their 2-sided 95% CIs were to be derived by 
calculating differences in means (20vPnC – 13vPnC) and CIs on the natural log scale of the 
concentrations/titres and then exponentiating the results. Two-sided 95% CIs were to be calculated 
based on the t-distribution (allowing for unequal variances).
Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were planned to be calculated as the mean of the difference of 
antibody levels (later result minus earlier result) on the natural log scale and exponentiating the results. 
The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were to be computed by exponentiating the CIs using Student’s t-
distribution for the mean difference on the natural log scale.
The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group were to be computed using the F distribution 
(Clopper-Pearson). The 95% CI for the between-group difference for binary endpoints were planned to be 
calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.

Primary immunogenicity endpoints analysis
1) For the percentage of participants with pneumococcal IgG concentrations above a prespecified 
threshold at 1 month after Dose 2, hypothesis testing was planned to be used to assess the NI of 
20vPnC to 13vPnC. The null hypothesis (H0A) for a serotype was
H0A: π20vPnC – π13vPnC ≤ –10%,
with a 10% margin for NI, where



π20vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG antibody 
concentration for the serotype from the 20vPnC group 1 month after Dose 2;
If the serotype is from the 13 matched serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F, 23F) in 13vPnC, π13vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG 
concentration for the serotype from the 13vPnC group 1 month after Dose 2;
If the serotype is from the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 33F) in 20vPnC, 
π13vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG concentration for the serotype 
with the lowest percentage among the 13 matched serotypes from the 13vPnC group 1 month after 
Dose 2, provided that the lowest percentage is not from serotype 3. If the lowest percentage in the 
13vPnC group is from serotype 3, the next lowest percentage in the 13vPnC group will be used in 
the comparison. Historical data suggest that serotype 3 behaves somewhat differently from the 
other serotypes in 13vPnC; therefore, IgG results from serotype 3 will not be used in the 
comparison to assess the NI of the 7 additional serotypes.
The null hypothesis (H0A) was to be rejected, and NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for the percentage of 
participants with a predefined IgG concentration for a serotype was to be declared if the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages was greater than –10%.
2) For the pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 2 hypothesis testing was planned to assess 
the NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC. The null hypothesis (H0B) for a serotype was
H0B: ln(μ20vPnC) – ln(μ13vPnC) ≤ ln(0.5)
where ln(0.5) corresponds to a 2-fold margin for NI and


ln(μ20vPnC) is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration in the 20vPnC group for 
that serotype 1 month after Dose 2;
If the serotype is from the 13 matched serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
23F), ln(μ13vPnC) is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration in the 13vPnC group 
1 month after Dose 2;
If the serotype is from the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 33F) in 20vPnC, ln(μ13vPnC) 
is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration for the serotype with the lowest IgG GMC 
among the 13 serotypes from the 13vPnC group 1 month after Dose 2, provided that the lowest GMC is 
not from serotype 3. If the lowest GMC in the 13vPnC group is from serotype 3, the next lowest GMC in 
the 13vPnC group will be used in the comparison. Historical data suggest that serotype 3 behaves 
somewhat differently from the other serotypes in 13vPnC; therefore, IgG results from serotype 3 will not 
be used in the comparison to assess the NI of the 7 additional serotypes.
3) A similar testing framework was set up to evaluate NI for pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after 
Dose 3. The null hypothesis (H0C) for a serotype was
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 43/198
H0C: ln(μ20vPnC) – ln(μ13vPnC) ≤ ln(0.5)
The null hypotheses H0B and H0C were to be rejected, and NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for the pneumococcal 
serotype-specific IgG GMC was to be declared for a serotype if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the IgG GMR of the 20vPnC group to the 13vPnC group for the serotype was greater than 0.5 (2-fold NI 
margin).
4) For the percentage of participants with antibody levels above prespecified levels for concomitant 
vaccine antigen at 1 month after Dose 3, hypothesis testing was planned to assess the NI of the 
20vPnC group to the 13vPnC group. For each of the applicable concomitant vaccine antigens 
(diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN), HBsAg, poliovirus strains, 
and Hib), the null hypothesis was:
H0C: π20vPnC – π13vPnC ≤ –10% 
where



10% is the margin for NI.
20vPnC is the percentage of participants with a prespecified antibody level to the specific 
π
concomitant vaccine antigen at 1 month after Dose 3 in the 20vPnC group.
π13vPnC is the percentage of participants with a prespecified antibody level to the specific 
concomitant vaccine antigen at 1 month after Dose 3 in the 13vPnC group.
The null hypothesis was to be rejected for a concomitant vaccine antigen if the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages, was greater than –10%.
For the GMCs of Antibody Levels to concomitant vaccine antigens 1 month after
Dose 3, hypothesis testing was planned to assess the NI of the 20vPnC group to the 13vPnC group. For 
each of the applicable concomitant vaccine antigens, the null hypothesis was:
H0D: ln(μ20vPnC) – ln(μ13vPnC) ≤ ln(0.5)
where



ln(0.5) corresponds to a 2-fold margin for NI.
ln(μ20vPnC) is the natural log of the GMCs for antibody levels to the specific concomitant vaccine at 1 
month after Dose 3 in the 20vPnC group.
ln(μ13vPnC) is the natural log of the GMCs for antibody levels to the specific concomitant vaccine at 1 
month after Dose 3 in the 13vPnC group.
The null hypothesis (H0D) testing for NI was to be rejected for a concomitant vaccine antigen if the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the concomitant antibody GMR (20vPnC over 13vPnC) is greater than 
0.5 (2-fold NI margin).
Overall, the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives were considered achieved if NI of the 
immune response induced by 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC based on both percentages of participants 
with predefined IgG levels and IgG GMCs at 1 month after Dose 2, as well as the IgG GMCs at 1 month 
after Dose 3, was established for all 20 serotypes, a total of 60 NI evaluations.
Therefore, the overall type I error rate for the primary immunogenicity assessment of the pneumococcal 
immune response of 20vPnC 1 month after Dose 3 was supposed to be controlled at the 0.05 level. 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 44/198
The primary concomitant immunogenicity objective was considered met if NI is achieved for each 
concomitant vaccine antigen. Therefore, the type I error rate for the concomitant immunogenicity 
assessment was supposed to be controlled at the 0.05 level.

Conduct of the study
Protocol amendments
There were 2 amendments to the original study protocol (11 February 2020). The most relevant change 
introduced with the Amendment 1 (13 April July 2020), was addition of serotype-specific IgG 
concentrations 1 month after Dose 3 to the primary objectives, based on regulatory agency feedback, 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 48/198
Additional changes included modification of the concomitant administration of MMR and varicella vaccines 
to allow greater flexibility with local practices, clarification to indicate that a fourth dose of Infanrix hexa 
is not permitted in the study and several editorial updates made to be consistent with other phase 3 
studies of 20vPnC. With Amendment 2 (18 June 2021) non-inferiority of IgG GMCs and the percentage of 
participants with predefined thresholds after second infant doses were added as primary immunogenicity 
objectives, and the objective for IgG percentage of participants with predefined thresholds after the 
toddler dose was moved from primary to the secondary objective, based on Scientific Advice from the 
CHMP. The statistical sections for these objectives were updated accordingly.

3. Percentages of Participants With a ≥4 Fold Rise in IgG Concentrations From Before 
Dose 3 to 1 Month After Dose 3
For the 13 matched serotypes, the percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in IgG concentrations 
from before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 74.2% (serotype 14) to 98.1% (serotype 6B) in the 
20vPnC group and from 71.5% (serotype 14) to 98.2% (serotype 6B) in the 13vPnC group. 
For the 7 additional serotypes, the percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in IgG concentrations 
from before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 83.5% (serotype 15B) to 95.5% (serotype 12F) in the 
20vPnC group. 
4. Percentage of participants with ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from before Dose 3 to 1 
month after Dose 3
For the 13 matched serotypes, the percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from 
before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 48.0% (serotype 7F) to 95.8 (serotype 4) in the 20vPnC 
group and from 63.8% (serotype 5) to 97.9% (serotype 18C) in the 13vPnC group.
For the 7 additional serotypes, the percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from 
before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 47.0% (serotype 33F) to 92.2% (serotype 22F) in the 
20vPnC group. As would be expected, there were very few participants with a ≥4-fold rise for the 7 
additional serotypes in the 13vPnC group.
Concomitant immunogenicity objective
In study B7471012, concomitant vaccine responses were assessed on randomly selected serum subsets 
with sufficient sera volumes. The NI of the percentages of participants with prespecified antibody levels to 
diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and Hib vaccine antigens, and NI of 
the GMRs of antibody levels to MMR and varicella vaccine antigens between the 20vPnC group and the 
13vPnC group at 1 month after dose 3 (age 12-13 months) were assessed (primary concomitant 
immunogenicity objectives). The NI criteria for these antigen assessments were the same as those used 
for the primary pneumococcal endpoints (2-fold criterion for a continuous endpoint and 10% criterion for 
a binary endpoint).

The Applicant also provided the subgroup analyses by vaccine timing (2, 4, and 11–12 months versus 3, 
5, and 11–12 months) for the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity endpoints. These data are 
provided for exploratory purposes, and it should be noted that the sample sizes of the subgroups are 
small, these analyses were not powered for noninferiority, and variables other than schedule, including 
country-specific factors, may be biasing the results. Therefore, conclusions based on these data should 
be approached with caution.
In general, the observed IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 2 were numerically higher for all vaccine 
serotypes in both vaccine groups (20vPnC and 13vPnC) in the subgroup vaccinated at 3 and 5 months of 
age than those vaccinated at 2 and 4 months of age. However, the point estimates of the IgG GMRs 
(20vPnC/13vPnC) 1 month after Dose 2 were generally similar or slightly numerically higher in the 
subgroup vaccinated at 2 and 4 months of age.
There were trends for higher observed point estimates of the percentage of participants with predefined 
IgG concentrations 1 month after Dose 2 in the subgroup vaccinated at 3 and 5 months of age, for both 
20vPnC and 13vPnC groups. However, there was no consistent trend in the percent difference (20vPnC – 
13vPnC) between the subgroups based on vaccine timing.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 73/198
The IgG GMCs and GMRs 1 month after Dose 3 were similar in the 2 subgroups regardless of infant 
vaccine timing.
In summary, although some numerical differences in the point estimates of the IgG responses 1 month 
after Dose 2 were observed between the 2 subgroups based on timing of infant vaccination, the trend 
did not persist after Dose 3, at completion of the vaccine series. The trend was observed in both 20vPnC 
and 13vPnC groups.
B7471011:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety 
and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in 
Healthy Infants (4-dose series)
Methods
B7471011 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind trial conducted in 
infants born at >36 weeks of gestation and ≥42 to ≤98 days of age at the time of consent. The planned 
duration of study participation was approximately 16 to 19 months for each infant. The trial was performed 
at 107 sites in the US and Puerto Rico. 
This trial was designed to provide NI comparisons of the 20vPnC immune responses with those of 13vPnC 
to infer effectiveness in infants when administered as a 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. 
Immunogenicity data were also generated for key routine US paediatric vaccines (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib 
combination vaccine, Pediarix®; Hib vaccine, Hiberix®; MMR vaccine, M-M-R II; and varicella vaccine, 
Varivax®) given concomitantly with 20vPnC or 13vPnC.

Treatments
Participants were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 
15 months of age (Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Participants were to receive a single dose (0.5 mL) 
of 20vPnC or 13vPnC intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at each 
vaccination visit (Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively). Participants were to receive 
the same vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC) for all 4 doses.
Concomitant vaccines
Participants also received a dose of a DTaP-containing vaccine in combination with other antigens 
(including poliovirus and hepatitis B) (PEDIARIX) and a dose of a Hib vaccine (HIBERIX) at Visits 1, 2, 
and 3. MMR (M-M-RII) and varicella (VARIVAX) vaccines were administered concomitantly with 20vPnC or 
13vPnC at Visit 5 with Dose 4. All concomitant vaccinations were administered into a limb other than the 
left leg (the site of 20vPnC or 13vPnC injection).

Sample size
A total of approximately 2000 enrolled participants was considered to yield approximately 1600 evaluable 
participants assuming a 20% non-evaluable rate for the study, resulting in approximately 800 evaluable 
participants for each vaccine group with a 1:1 randomization ratio between the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups. Sample size and power for the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives associated with 
IgG concentration results at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 were assessed based on 
simulations with assumptions supported by IgG results from an internal Pfizer Phase 2 infant study of 
20vPnC (B7471003) following multivariate log-normal distributions.
Assuming the true GMCs and variance-covariance matrices for the 20 serotype-specific IgG
concentrations from both 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups are the same as those observed from Study 
B7471003, with 800 evaluable participants from each vaccine group, simulations showed that the study 
had approximately 93% probability to show at least 37 (out of 40 total) positive non-inferiority 
assessments comparing IgG results between the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, based on percentages of

participants with predefined serotype specific IgG concentration levels at 1 month after Dose 3 and 
serotype-specific IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 4 for the 20 serotypes.
This sample size was considered suitable to also have sufficient power for all NI tests for the (coprimary) 
concomitant immunogenicity objective, as well as for the primary safety objective.
Randomisation
All eligible participants were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. 
Allocation of participants to vaccine groups was planned to proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology (IRT) system (interactive Web-based response [IWR]). 
The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) was planned to be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, 
and the participant number. The site personnel was to be provided with a vaccine assignment, 
randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container numbers when investigational product was 
supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system was supposed to provide a confirmation report containing 
the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container numbers assigned. The confirmation 
report was to be stored in the site’s files.
Blinding (masking)
The study was planned to be participant- and investigator-blinded. Sponsor personnel and investigators 
involved in evaluating participant data in the primary study population were planned to be blinded to 
vaccine assignment until the analysis at the completion of the primary study population. 
The protocol foresaw a ‘Primary Analysis 1’, when complete safety and immunogenicity data through 1 
month after Dose 3 from all participants were available; The study team was planned to remain blinded 
up to this Primary Analysis 1. However, according to the SAP, Primary analysis 1 was planned to be 
omitted because of internal business decisions. The first of the planned statistical analyses was then to be 
carried out when the safety and immunogenicity data through 1 month after Dose 4 were available and 
released. For this reason, the study team was planned to be unblinded after the last participant 
completes Visit 6 (1 month after Dose 4). The investigator site staff was to remain blinded to participant 
vaccine group until the last participant completed the final visit and the database has been locked for final 
analysis. Laboratory personnel performing the assays was to remain blinded until all assays are 
completed and assay results finalized.
Standard proceedings for blind breaking during study conduct were put in place with the study protocol.
Statistical methods
 Unless otherwise stated, descriptive statistics for continuous variables were n, mean, median,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (eg, 
proportions) were the percentage (%), the numerator (n) and the denominator (N) used in the 
percentage calculation, and the 95% CI where applicable.
All baseline characteristics including demographic data, medical history and participants’ disposition and 
compliance were planned to be analysed in descriptive manner. Subset analyses were planned to be done 
in descriptive manner for the critical safety and immunogenicity endpoints, separately by sex and race.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 81/198
A separate exploratory analysis of primary safety endpoints (prompted local reactions, prompted 
systemic events, and AEs) was planned to be performed for the subsets of participants who received 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered at the same visit with and without influenza vaccine, if the 
number of participants included in a subset was large enough. Otherwise, these data was planned to be 
listed.
In general, standard statistical methodology for reporting all safety data was planned to be used. Details 
regarding the local tolerance and safety data analyses had been prespecified in the SAP.   
According to protocol, statistical analyses were planned to be carried out when the final data for the 
specified analyses were available:



Primary Analysis 1: complete safety and immunogenicity data through 1 month after Dose 3 
from all participants;
Primary Analysis 2: complete safety and immunogenicity data from 1 month after Dose 3 through 
1 month after Dose 4 from all participants;
Final safety analysis: complete safety data from 1 month after Dose 4 through the visit 
occurring 6 months after Dose 4 from all participants.
However, according to the SAP, Primary analysis 1 was not to be conducted because of internal 
business decisions. The first of the planned statistical analyses was then planned to be carried out 
when the safety and immunogenicity data through 1 month after Dose 4 were available and 
released.
Analysis sets
Analysis populations were defined for the statistical analysis of safety and immunogenicity data according 
to the table:
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 82/198
For the Dose 3 and Dose 4 evaluable immunogenicity population definition, the blood collection window 
has been expanded by 1 extra day before, and 14 days after, the protocol-specified blood collection 
window of 28 to 42 days defined in the protocol, for consistency with established rules in the Prevnar 13 
program.
Immunogenicity analyses
The estimands to evaluate the immunogenicity objectives for non-inferiority were planned to be based on 
evaluable populations. These estimands were supposed to estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical 
setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. The 
estimand addressed the objective of estimating the maximum potential difference between 2 groups, 
since the impact of noncompliance is likely to diminish the observed difference between the 2 groups.
Empirical Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves (RCDCs) were to be plotted as a step function of 
proportion of participants with assay results equal to or exceeding a specified value versus the indicated 
assay value, for all observed assay values.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 83/198
For immunogenicity results of IgG concentrations, OPA titres, and the antibody levels of the concomitant 
vaccines, geometric means (GMs) were to be computed along with associated 95% CIs. The GMs and the 
95% CIs were planned to be calculated as the means and the CIs of the assay results on the natural log 
scale and then exponentiating the results. Two-sided 95% CIs were to be calculated based on the t-
distribution.
Where appropriate, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and their 2-sided 95% CIs were to be derived by 
calculating differences in means and CIs on the natural log scale of the concentrations/titres and then 
exponentiating the results. 
Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were planned to be calculated as the mean of the difference of 
antibody levels (later result minus earlier result) on the natural log scale and exponentiating the results. 
The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were to be computed by exponentiating the CIs using Student’s t-
distribution for the mean difference on the natural log scale.
The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group were to be computed using the F distribution 
(Clopper-Pearson). The 95% CI for the between-group difference for binary endpoints were planned to be 
calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
Primary immunogenicity endpoints analysis
For the percentage of participants with pneumococcal IgG concentrations above a prespecified threshold 
at 1 month after Dose 3, hypothesis testing was planned to be used to assess the NI of 20vPnC to 
13vPnC. The null hypothesis (H0A) for a serotype was
H0A: π20vPnC – π13vPnC ≤ –10%,
with a 10% margin for NI, where



π20vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG antibody 
concentration for the serotype from the 20vPnC group 1 month after Dose 3;
If the serotype is from the 13 matched serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F, 23F) in 13vPnC, π13vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG 
concentration for the serotype from the 13vPnC group 1 month after Dose 3;
If the serotype is from the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 33F) in 20vPnC, 
π13vPnC is the percentage of participants achieving the predefined IgG concentration for the serotype 
with the lowest percentage among the 13 matched serotypes from the 13vPnC group 1 month after 
Dose 3, provided that the lowest percentage is not from serotype 3. If the lowest percentage in the 
13vPnC group is from serotype 3, the next lowest percentage in the 13vPnC group will be used in 
the comparison. Historical data suggest that serotype 3 behaves somewhat differently from the 
other serotypes in 13vPnC; therefore, IgG results from serotype 3 will not be used in the 
comparison to assess the NI of the 7 additional serotypes.
The null hypothesis (H0A) was to be rejected, and NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for the percentage
of participants with a predefined IgG concentration for a serotype was to be declared if the lower bound 
of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages was greater than –10%.
For the pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 4 hypothesis testing was planned to assess the NI of 
20vPnC to 13vPnC. The null hypothesis (H0B) for a serotype was
H0B: ln(μ20vPnC) – ln(μ13vPnC) ≤ ln(0.5)
where ln(0.5) corresponds to a 2-fold margin for NI and
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244




ln(μ20vPnC) is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration in the 20vPnC group for 
that serotype 1 month after Dose 4;
If the serotype is from the 13 matched serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
23F), ln(μ13vPnC) is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration in the 13vPnC group 
1 month after Dose 4;
If the serotype is from the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 33F) in 20vPnC, 
ln(μ13vPnC) is the natural log of the geometric mean IgG concentration for the serotype with the 
lowest IgG GMC among the 13 serotypes from the 13vPnC group 1 month after Dose 4, provided 
that the lowest GMC is not from serotype 3. If the lowest GMC in the 13vPnC group is from 
serotype 3, the next lowest GMC in the 13vPnC group will be used in the comparison. Historical 
data suggest that serotype 3 behaves somewhat differently from the other serotypes in 13vPnC; 
therefore, IgG results from serotype 3 will not be used in the comparison to assess the NI of the 
7 additional serotypes.
The null hypotheses H0B was to be rejected, and NI of 20vPnC to 13vPnC for the pneumococcal 
serotype-specific IgG GMC was to be declared for a serotype if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the IgG GMR of the 20vPnC group to the 13vPnC group for the serotype was greater than 0.5 (2-fold NI 
margin).
For the percentage of participants with antibody levels above prespecified levels for concomitant vaccine 
antigen at 1 month after Dose 3, hypothesis testing was planned to assess the NI of the 20vPnC group to 
the 13vPnC group. For this a very similar methodological approach as described above for the percentage 
of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations was planned. 
The null hypothesis was to be rejected for a concomitant vaccine antigen if the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages, was greater than –10%.
Overall, the primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives were considered to be achieved if NI of the 
immune response induced by 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC based on both percentages of participants 
with predefined IgG levels and IgG GMCs at 1 month after Dose 3, as well as the IgG GMCs at 1 month 
after Dose 4, was established for all 20 serotypes, a total of 40 NI evaluations.
Therefore, the overall type I error rate for the primary immunogenicity assessment of the pneumococcal 
immune response of 20vPnC was supposed to controlled at the 0.05 level. 
The primary concomitant immunogenicity objective was considered to be met if NI is achieved for each 
concomitant vaccine antigen. Therefore, the type I error rate for the concomitant immunogenicity 
assessment was supposed to controlled at the 0.05 level.
Secondary and further immunogenicity endpoints analysis
A similar testing framework as described for the primary analyses was set up to evaluate NI for 
pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 3 as key secondary endpoint. 
A similar testing framework as described for the primary analyses was set up to evaluate NI for GMCs of 
Antibody Levels to Concomitant Vaccine Antigen at 1 Month After Dose 4 as secondary endpoint.
The following endpoints were planned to be analyses as secondary/additional endpoints using standard 
statistical methodology, not involving hypothesis testing (for NI):

There were no or very few participants with a ≥4-fold rise for the 7 additional serotypes in the 13vPnC 
group.
Concomitant immunogenicity objectives
In study B7471011, the concomitant vaccine responses were assessed on randomly selected serum 
subsets with sufficient sera volumes. The NI of the percentages of participants with prespecified antibody 
levels to diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and Hib vaccine antigens 
between the 20vPnC group and the 13vPnC group at 1 month after dose 3 (age 7 months; primary 
concomitant immunogenicity objectives), as well as the NI of the GMRs of antibody levels to MMR and 
varicella vaccine antigens between the 20vPnC group and the 13vPnC group at 1 month after dose 4 (age 
13-16 months; secondary concomitant immunogenicity objectives) were assessed using the same NI 
criteria as for the primary pneumococcal endpoints (2-fold criterion for a continuous endpoint and 10% 
criterion for a binary endpoint).

Ancillary analyses
In B7471011, subgroup analyses were performed separately by sex and by race for the primary and key 
secondary pneumococcal immunogenicity endpoints: IgG GMCs at 1 month after the toddler dose (Dose 
4), the percentages of participants with predefined pneumococcal IgG concentrations at 1 month after the 
last infant dose (Dose 3), and IgG GMCs at 1 month after the last infant dose (Dose 3).
Robust immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 in 
the 20vPnC group were observed for each of the sex and race subgroups based on percentage of 
participants with predefined IgG concentrations and IgG GMCs. There was a trend of slightly higher 
observed responses in female and Black or African American subgroups, but the sample sizes were small 
for the non-White population. The trends were consistent between the vaccine groups, so the relative 
responses between 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups within the subgroups were generally similar.

Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population: All eligible randomized 
participants who received the vaccines to which they were randomly assigned 
at the first 2 doses, had at least 1 valid immunogenicity result from the blood 
sample collection at the 1-month-after-Dose 2 visit within an appropriate 
window, and had no other major protocol deviations
 4 of the 13 matched serotypes met the 10% statistical NI criterion. 
 9 of the 13 matched serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 9V, 18C and 23F) 
missed the statistical NI criterion.
 5 of the 7 additional serotypes met the 10% statistical NI criterion 
compared with the lowest percentage among the 13 serotypes (serotype 
6B) in the 13vPnC group. 
 2 of the 7 additional serotypes (10A and 12F) missed the statistical NI 
criterion
CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest 
response in the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead 
interpretation of the IgG response due to systematic overestimation
Non-inferiority criterion was met for 4/13 shared serotypes, however the 
response rates were numerically lower with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC. 
The percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG 
concentrations ranged from 20.7% (serotype 6B) to 94.3% (serotype 19F) 
in the 20vPnC group, and from 36.5% (serotype 6B) to 95.7% (serotype 
19F) in the 13vPnC group.
For the additional 7 serotypes, the percentage of participants with 
predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations ranged from 28.9% 
(serotype 10A) to 96.5% (serotype 8) in the 20vPnC group.

CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest 
response in the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead 
interpretation of the IgG response due to systematic overestimation.
Non-inferiority to 13vPnC was shown for 9/13 shared serotypes, however, 
numerically lower IgG GMCs were observed with 20vPnC compared to 
13vPnC. Point estimates for IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.51 
(serotype 6B) to 0.82 (serotype 14). The upper bound of 95% CIs for IgG 
GMR did not include unity for any serotype. For the shared serotypes, the 
IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 2 ranged from 0.03 μg/mL (serotype 6B) to 
2.21 μg/mL (serotype 19F) in the 20vPnC group and from 0.06 μg/mL 
(serotype 6B) to 3.06 μg/mL (serotype 19F) in the 13vPnC group. For the 
majority of serotypes in 20vPnC group, the IgG GMCs were very close to or 
even below the pre-defined cut-offs.
For the 7 additional serotypes, the IgG GMCs ranged from 0.15 μg/mL 
(serotype 12F) to 3.33 μg/mL (serotype 15B) in the 20vPnC group 1 month

Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population: All eligible randomized participants who 
received the vaccines to which they were randomly assigned at the first 3 doses, had at 
least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result from the 1-month-after-Dose 3 
visit, had blood collection within an appropriate window after Dose 3, and had no other 
major protocol deviations.
 8 of the 13 matched serotypes met the 10% statistical NI criterion. 
 5 of the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 9V, and 23F) missed the statistical NI criterion 
 6 of the 7 additional serotypes met the 10% statistical NI criterion compared with 
the lowest percentage among the 13 serotypes (serotype 6B) in the 13vPnC group.
 Serotype 12F missed the statistical NI criterion. 
CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest response in 
the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead interpretation of the IgG 
response due to systematic overestimation.
For serotype 3, the 95% CI lay entirely below the NI margin of -10%. Even for the 8/13 
shared serotypes for which NI criterion was met, numerically lower response rates were 
observed with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC. The percentage of participants with 
predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations ranged from 52.1% (serotype 3) to 
97.1% (serotype 19A) in the 20vPnC group, and from 67.6% (serotype 3) to 98.1% 
(serotype 19A) in the 13vPnC group.
Of 7 additional serotypes, serotype 12F missed the NI criterion, as the percentage point 
difference (20vPnC-13vPnC) was -18.1 and the entire 95% CI lay below the NI margin 
(95% CI -22.1%, -14.0%). For the additional 7 serotypes, the response rate ranged 
from 67.5% (serotype 12F) to 98.3% (serotype 22F) in the 20vPnC group.

Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population: All eligible randomized participants who 
received the vaccines to which they were randomly assigned at the first 3 doses, had at 
least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result from the 1-month-after-Dose 3 
visit, had blood collection within an appropriate window after Dose 3, and had no other 
major protocol deviations.
 All of the 13 matched serotypes met the 2-fold statistical NI criterion.
 All of the 7 additional serotypes met the 2-fold statistical NI criterion compared with 
the lowest IgG GMC (serotype 19A) among the 13 serotypes (excluding serotype 3) 
in the 13vPnC group. 
CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest response in 
the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead interpretation of the 
IgG response due to systematic overestimation.
Although the NI criterion of ≥0.5 was met for all shared serotypes, numerically lower 
IgG GMCs were observed with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC. For shared serotypes, the 
point estimates for IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.60 (serotype 6B) to 0.79 
(serotypes 14, 19A and 19F). The upper bound of 95% CIs for IgG GMR did not include 
unity for any serotype. The IgG GMCs ranged from 0.36 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 2.16 
μg/mL (serotype 14) in the 20vPnC group and from 0.51 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 2.72 
μg/mL (serotype 14) in the 13vPnC group. For the majority of serotypes, the IgG GMCs 
were above the pre-defined cut-offs. Only for serotype 3, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI of IgG GMC was at 0.33 μg/mL, which is below the cut-off of 0.35 μg/mL.
The IgG GMCs of 7 additional serotypes 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 0.55 μg/mL 
(serotype 12F) to 4.40 μg/mL (serotype 15B) in the 20vPnC group and from 0.01 
μg/mL to 0.03 μg/mL in the 13vPnC group. Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for all 7 additional 
serotypes were much higher than the IgG GMCs from the corresponding serotypes in 
the 13vPnC group.

13 serotypes (excluding serotype 3) in the 13vPnC group. 
CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest response in 
the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead interpretation of the IgG 
response due to systematic overestimation.
The NI criterion for IgG GMRs after Dose 4 was met for all shared serotypes. 
Nonetheless, numerically lower IgG GMCs were observed with 20vPnC compared to 
13vPnC for the 13 shared serotypes. For the shared serotypes, the point estimates for 
IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.66 (serotype 3) to 0.90 (serotype 14). The 
upper bound of 95% CIs for IgG GMR did not include unity, except for the serotype 14 
(95% CI 0.81, 1.00). For the shared serotypes, the IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 4 
ranged from 0.56 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 9.01 μg/mL (serotype 6A) in the 20vPnC group 
and from 0.85 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 11.69 μg/mL (serotype 6A) in the 13vPnC group. 
For the majority of shared serotypes in both groups, the IgG GMCs were well above the 
pre-defined cut-offs. 
For 7 additional serotypes, the IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 4 ranged from 1.85 
μg/mL (serotype 12F) to 12.59 μg/mL (serotype 15B) in the 20vPnC group. 
Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for all 7 additional serotypes were much higher than the IgG 
GMCs from the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC group.

 For the 13 matched serotypes, the observed differences (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in 
percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations 1 
month after Dose 4 ranged from -12.1% (serotype 3) to 0.3% (serotype 18C)
 For the 7 additional serotypes, the observed differences in percentage of 
participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations 1 month after 
Dose 4 ranged from -1.9% (serotype 12F) to 2.6% (serotype 15B), between the 
20vPnC group and the lowest percentage among the 13 serotypes (serotype 1, 
excluding serotype 3) in the 13vPnC group
CAVE: For the 7 additional serotypes, comparison was made to the lowest response in 
the control arm; such comparison has the potential to mislead interpretation of the 
IgG response due to systematic overestimation.
For the 13 shared serotypes, the response rate ranged between 73.6% (serotype 3) 
and 99.9% (serotype 7F) in the 20vPnC group and between 85.8% (serotype 3) and 
99.9% (serotype 7F) in the 13vPnC group. Although NI was not formally tested for this 
endpoint, for serotype 3 the point estimate for the difference in response rate was 
below -10% (-12.1% (95% CI -16.2, -8.1%)).
For the 7 additional serotypes, the observed percentages of participants with 
predefined serotype-specific IgG concentration ranged from 95.2% (serotype 12F) to 
99.7% (serotype 15B) in the 20vPnC group.
Notes
Clinical studies in special populations
There were no studies in special populations with 20vPnC. During a scientific advice procedure, the CHMP 
agreed that, given the experience with Prevenar 13 in special populations (sickle cell disease, HIV 
infection, or with an hematopoietic stem cell transplant, preterm), a successful demonstration of 
comparable immune responses for the 20-valent vaccine vs. Prevenar 13 could allow similar statements 
to appear in the SmPC for the 20-valent vaccine. However, the SmPC would clarify that the statement is 
based on data with Prevenar 13. This agreement is upheld.

Supportive studies
The data presented below regarding the percentage of participants with pre-defined IgG concentrations 
are based on the thresholds initially pprovided by the Applicant, which were not endorsed by the CHMP. 
However, as the results in the main studies are comparable between the initially submitted analysis and 
the post-hoc analyses, no updated analyses were requested for the supportive studies.
Phase 3 Trial in US Participants ≥15 Months to <18 Years of Age (B7471014)
B7471014 is a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, single-arm trial in participants ≥15 months to <18 
years of age at the time of consent. The trial was conducted at 40 sites in the US. Participants 15 months 
to <5 years of age were required to have documentation of at least 3 doses of 13vPnC prior to enrolment. 
The information on the most recent dose of pneumococcal vaccine was also collected if available in 
participants ≥5 years of age (Cohorts 3 and 4). This trial was performed to provide 20vPnC 
immunogenicity data in children in the setting of a well-established national infant pneumococcal 
conjugate immunization program, where direct protection against the 7 additional serotypes may offer 
benefit, and to support an indication for 20vPnC in children up to <18 years of age.
Study Participants: The study population consisted of healthy male or female children ≥15 months to 
<18 years of age at the time of consent (Cohort 1: ≥15 to <24 months, Cohort 2: ≥2 to <5 years, 
Cohort 3: ≥5 to <10 years, and Cohort 4: ≥10 to <18 years; approximately 200 participants in each 
cohort). 
For children ≥15 months to <5 years of age (Cohorts 1 and 2): written documentation of receipt of at 
least 3 doses of 13vPnC; the last dose of 13vPnC was to have been administered >2 months before 
enrollment into the trial.
Subjects with a history of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae, adverse 
reactions to vaccination, significant neurological disorders or with known/suspected immunodeficiency or 
under immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from the study population. In addition, previous 
vaccination with any investigational pneumococcal vaccine or with PPSV23, or planned receipt through 
trial participation resulted in exclusion.
Treatments Participants received a single dose of 20vPnC on Day 1 (Visit 1). Participants returned for 
Visit 2, approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after Visit 1. Participants’ parents/legal guardians were 
contacted via telephone for safety follow-up Visit 3, approximately 6 months (168 to 196 days) after Visit 
1. The duration of this trial for each participant was approximately 6 months.
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to demonstrate that the serotype-specific IgG 
concentrations for the 7 additional serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC are superior to the corresponding IgG 
concentrations before 20vPnC (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), (2) to demonstrate that the serotype-specific OPA 
titres for the 7 additional serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC are superior to the corresponding OPA titres 
before 20vPnC (Cohort 3 and Cohort 4), (3) to further describe the immune responses to 20vPnC in 
Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Prior pneumococcal vaccination
Participants’ age at the time of their last 13vPnC or 7vPnC vaccination will be categorized as <1 year of 
age or ≥1 year of age. Additionally, time since the last 13vPnC or 7vPnC vaccination will be categorized 
in the following intervals: 2 to<6 months, 6 to<12 months, 1 to<5 years, 5 to<10 years, and 10 years or 
more.
Hypotheses and Decision Rules
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2
For the primary immunogenicity objective, hypothesis testing will be used to assess superiority of the IgG 
concentrations for the 7 additional pneumococcal serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC to the IgG 
concentrations before 20vPnC within each cohort. The null hypothesis (H0) for a serotype is
H0: μfold rise ≤ 1.0
where

μfold rise is the geometric mean of the fold rise in IgG concentration from before to 1 month after 
vaccination;
The null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected for a serotype if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
calculated based on the Student’s t-distribution for the IgG GMFR is greater than 1.0.
Cohort 3 and Cohort 4
For the primary immunogenicity objective, hypothesis testing will be used to assess superiority of the 
OPA titres for the 7 additional pneumococcal serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC to the OPA titres before 
20vPnC within each cohort. The null hypothesis (H0) for a serotype is
H0: μfold rise ≤ 1.0
where
 μfold rise is the geometric mean of the fold change in OPA titre from before to 1 month after 
vaccination;
The null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected for a serotype if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
calculated based on the Students t-distribution for the OPA GMFR is greater than 1.0.

Disposition of participants
A total of 839 participants were enrolled — between 203 and 219 participants in each of the 4 age 
cohorts.  Approximately 99% of participants in each cohort were vaccinated (831 participants in total). 
Greater than 95.0% of participants in each age cohort completed all visits per protocol. 
A small percentage (≤4.1% in each age cohort) of participants were withdrawn from the trial; the most 
common reason for withdrawal was lost to follow-up. The one participant (≥10 years of age; Cohort 4) in 
the “other” category was withdrawn per physician decision for non-safety reasons (Appendix 16.2.1.1). 
No participant discontinued from the trial due to an AE or specifically for COVID-19-related reasons.
Populations analysed
The number of participants included in the all-available and evaluable immunogenicity populations were 
similar. Since the difference between the numbers of participants in the evaluable immunogenicity 
population and the all-available immunogenicity population was <10%, no analyses were performed for 
the all-available immunogenicity population per the study SAP. 
Baseline characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics of sex, race, and ethnicity for the safety population were 
generally similar across the 4 age cohorts. There were somewhat more male participants in each age 
cohort, except in participants ≥2 to <5 years of age (Cohort 2, which had an approximately equal 
distribution). The majority of the study population was White (80.1% to 86.8%/cohort), and non-
Hispanic/non-Latino (78.5% to 83.6%/cohort) across all age cohorts.

OPA GMTs and GMFRs for the 13vPnC Serotypes
OPA titres for the 13vPnC serotypes were determined on serum samples from a randomly selected subset 
of participants ≥10 to <18 years of age.
Increases in OPA GMTs were observed for all 13vPnC serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC in participants ≥10 
to <18 years of age. GMTs before vaccination ranged from 11 (serotype 1) to 516 (serotype 7F). GMTs 
after 20vPnC ranged from 105 (serotype 3) to 10,085 (serotype 6B) (Supplemental Table 14.8). OPA 
GMFRs for the 13vPnC serotypes ranged from 5.8 (serotype 3) to 147.9 (serotype 6A) (Table 12).
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup Analyses by Sex and Race
For the 7 additional serotypes, IgG GMFRs in participants ≥15 months to <5 years of age (Cohorts 1 and 
2) and OPA GMFRS in participants ≥5 to <18 years of age (Cohorts 3 and 4) were generally similar in 
male and female participants and in each of the race subgroups.
Subgroup Analyses by Timing of Last Prior Dose of 13vPnC in Participants ≥15 to <24 Months of Age
Among participants ≥15 to <24 months of age, 24.9% (N = 52) received their last dose of 13vPnC as 
part of their routine health care prior to study enrollment at <1 year of age (ie, received 20vPnC in this 
study as a toddler dose following only infant doses of 13vPnC), and 75.1% (N = 157) received their last 
dose of 13vPnC at ≥1 year of age followed by 20vPnC in this study. The sample size was small in the 
subgroup with last prior 13vPnC dose at <1 year of age, but robust and comparable responses to the 
13vPnC serotypes were observed after 20vPnC whether participants previously received infant doses of 
13vPnC only, or infant and toddler doses of 13vPnC. The percentages of participants ≥15 to <24 months 
of age with predefined IgG concentrations for the 13vPnC serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC were generally 
similar in the 2 subgroups (Supplemental Table 14.18), with percentages in both subgroups >93% for 12 
of the 13vPnC serotypes and 70.2% and 71.3% for serotype 3.
IgG GMCs for the 13vPnC serotypes before vaccination were higher in participants who received their last 
dose of 13vPnC at ≥1 year of age, as expected in this group vaccinated with infant doses and a toddler 
dose of 13vPnC. At 1 month after 20vPnC, IgG GMCs were similar in the subgroups. 
Phase 2 Trial in Infants (B7471003)
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 128/198
Study Design: Study B7471003 was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active 
comparator-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) in healthy infants and inform further clinical development of 20vPnC in the 
paediatric populations. 
Treatment: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, and 
6 months of age (infant series, Doses 1 through 3) and 12 months of age (Dose 4). Pediarix (GSK), a 
vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis, polio, and hepatitis B antigens was 
provided by the sponsor for concomitant administration with Doses 1 to 3. 
Study Participants: The study population consisted of healthy male or female infants born at >36 
weeks of gestation and aged 2 months (≥42 to ≤98 days) at the time of consent. Study subjects did not 
receive previous vaccination with pneumococcal vaccines or had a history of microbiologically proven 
invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. Infants who received treatment with immunosuppressive 
therapy or with known/suspected immunodeficiency were also excluded from the study population.
A total of 460 participants were randomized across both vaccine groups. In the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups, 83.2% and 82.5% of participants completed the visit 1 month after Dose 4, respectively. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics, including age, gender and ethnicity were presented 
descriptively. The median age was 64.5 days, ranging from 44 to 95 days. The majority of participants 
(50.7% male; 49.3% female) were not Hispanic or Latino (81.0%). Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention groups.
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the safety profile of 20-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) in healthy infants, (2) to describe the immunogenicity of 
20vPnC in healthy infants, (3) to further describe the immunogenicity of 20vPnC in healthy infants; to 
further describe the immunogenicity of 20vPnC in healthy infants.
Results:
Vaccination with 20vPnC elicited serotype-specific immune responses, as assessed by IgG GMCs at 1 
month after dose 3 and dose 4, respectively for all 20 serotypes contained in the vaccine. For the 13 
serotypes common to both 20vPnC and 13vPnC, the IgG GMCs were comparable but overall, numerically 
lower in the 20vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC group. For the 7 additional serotypes in 20vPnC, the 
IgG GMCs were higher in the 20vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC group.

OPA titres were determined on sera from a small number of randomly selected participants. For the 13 
serotypes common to both 20vPnC and 13vPnC, the OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) were usually 
numerically lower in the 20vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC group after dose 3 and dose 4, 
respectively. For the 7 additional serotypes in 20vPnC, OPA GMTs were higher in the 20vPnC group 
compared to the 13vPnC group.

for 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups on sera collected 1 month after Dose 3. Overall, diphtheria and pertussis 
GMCs were similar after vaccination with 13vPnC or 20vPnC at the investigated interval.

Additional considerations 
-
- 
No studies have been performed to support the transitioning from another PCV to 20vPnC
There is an ongoing study (B7471027) which will evaluate 1 or 2 catch-up doses of 20vPnC in 
toddlers 12-24 months of age (who have received 2 prior infant doses of Prevenar 13) and will also 
include a Prevenar 13 control arm.

No studies have been performed to support catch up vaccination of unvaccinated children aged 7 
months to 5 years of age
2.4.2.  Discussion on immunogenicity
This application is based on the inference of 20vPnC effectiveness for the prevention of vaccine serotype-
specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration of non-inferior immune responses to the 13 shared 
serotypes included in 13vPnC. The immunobridging approach is in accordance with EMA guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and has already been used for the approval of other pneumococcal 
conjugated vaccines. 
A surrogate of protection, IgG of 0.35 µg/mL, has been established for invasive pneumococcal disease 
(IPD) in children, which can be used to infer protection against IPD. However, for pneumonia and acute 
otitis media (AOM), no correlate or surrogate of protection exists. 13vPnC has been shown to be effective, 
as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated children has been observed. However, no exact vaccine 
efficacy estimate was determined, nor the immune response required to achieve protection. Therefore, 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 134/198
 
the strategy of NI testing for 20vPnC to 13vPnC introduces the possibility that, since the observed 
immune response with 20vPnC was lower than with 13vPnC, 20vPnC might not be effective against 
pneumonia and AOM.  The clinical significance of NI evaluations for pneumonia and AOM remains 
unknown. In addition, it is currently unknown whether the threshold of ≥0.35 µg/mL can also be 
considered protective for the new serotypes included in this vaccine for any indication. 
Clinical study programme of Prevenar 20 in paediatric population comprised 5 clinical studies. 
Immunogenicity (alongside safety) was investigated in 4 clinical studies of which three are phase 3 
studies (B7471012, B7471011 and B7471014) and one is a phase 2 study (B7471003). Studies 
B7471012 and B7471011 are considered pivotal as they provide the main evidence for immunogenicity 
and safety in the target population. An additional phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial in infants, using 
a 4-dose schedule study (B7471013) has been presented by the applicant. This was primarily a safety 
study, immunogenicity was not assessed, hence this study is not further discussed in this section. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Both pivotal trials were phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, multicentre, to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in healthy infants when administered as a series of 2 
infant doses and 1 toddler dose (B7471012), or as a series of 3 infant doses and 1 toddler dose 
(B7471011). The former regimen is the most used regimen across the EU countries, while the latter 
represents an alternative regimen recommended in some EU countries or in specific cased e.g., in pre-
term children. Both pivotal trials were designed to provide non-inferiority (NI) comparisons of the 20vPnC 
immune responses with those of 13vPnC. The choice of 13vPnC as comparator is acceptable, as 13vPnC is 
the only currently available conjugated pneumococcal vaccine for which effectiveness has been 
demonstrated in post-authorisation effectiveness studies. In addition, 20vPnC and 13vPnC were 
administered concomitantly with vaccines recommended in the frame of routine child vaccination 
programmes as offered in some European countries. Studies were conducted globally. Given different 
distribution of serotypes across the world, it is important to note that EU sites were also included in 
B7471012.
In both pivotal trials, last immunogenicity evaluations were performed approximately 1-month post-
toddler dose; no measurements are available for later time points. This precludes assessment of the 
duration of the immune response and associated assumed long-term efficacy. In B7471012 safety follow-
up was conducted for only one month after the last dose. However, this can be accepted since the safety 
data from the B7471011 study, for which the safety follow-up was 6 months, is reassuring (see safety). 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. In the 3-dose schedule 
vaccines were administered at roughly 2-3, 4-5, and 11-12 months of age, while in the 4-dose schedule 
vaccines were administered at roughly 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 
In B7471012 (3-dose series), the primary NI immunogenicity comparisons were based on 1) percentages 
of participants achieving predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations at 1 month after the last infant 
dose (Dose 2); 2) serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 1 month after the last infant dose (Dose 2); and 3) IgG 
GMCs at 1 month after the toddler dose (Dose 3). 
In B7471011 (4-dose series), the primary NI immunogenicity comparisons were based on 1) percentage 
of participants with predefined pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG concentration 1 month after the last 
infant dose (Dose 3); and 2) pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG concentration 1 month after the toddler 
dose (Dose 4). Pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG GMCs 1 month after last infant dose (Dose 3) has

been included as key secondary pneumococcal immunogenicity objective. Hypotheses were tested for 
primary and key secondary immunogenicity endpoints.
In general, the comparison of immune responses after the last infant dose is the most sensitive time 
point for detecting potential differences between vaccines. In addition, this time point is important to 
understand whether 20vPnC can provide a similar level of protection as 13vPnC for the 13 shared 
serotypes in the period between the last infant dose and the toddler dose. 
The immunobridging approach based on non-inferiority is generally acceptable. However, it should be 
noted that, while the NI margin of -10% for the difference (20vPnC minus 13vPnC) in percentage of 
participants achieving the predefined IgG antibody concentration) and NI margin of 0.5 for the 
pneumococcal IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) have been previously used in clinical studies of authorised 
pneumococcal vaccines, they have not been justified from a clinical perspective. Therefore, meeting or 
not meeting these NI criteria is of unknown clinical relevance. The assessment and interpretation of 
analysis outcome contained in the assessment documents is thoroughly based on the margins that had 
been implemented.
The statistical methodology planned and applied per each of the numerous NI tests is considered 
adequate. However, there is poor correspondence between planning documents and the clinical study 
report (CSR) as regard the definition of the set of individual primary immunogenicity NI evaluations 
(hypothesis tests). The requirement to conclude NI in all primary tests was no longer pursued. The 
consequence thereof is in principle inadequate control of type-1-error. Also, further considerations in 
relation to multiplicity are hampered as 15/60 statistical tests did not reveal sufficient evidence to 
conclude on NI.
Furthermore, the approach for NI comparisons of the 7 additional serotypes against the lowest observed 
response among the vaccine serotypes in the 13vPnC group (excluding serotype 3) is considered rather 
uninformative and might even be potentially misleading. From the methodological perspective, this way 
of choosing the comparator threshold disregards the fact that IgG concentrations (/increases) for different 
serotypes follow different distributions (i.e., can be expected to differ in mean and variability). 
Consequently, the estimated values for the 20vPnC/13vPnC-ratios for GMC and percentage above 
predefined IgG-levels can get unreasonably high. Furthermore, given the tendency that lower mean 
response is associated with smaller variability in the raw concentration data, the width of the 95% CIs 
computed for the NI evaluation (for ratios) could become arbitrarily small. Consequently, NI testing setup 
for the 7 additional serotypes is not considered sufficiently informative, neither for the evaluation of IgG-
response, nor for the potential implication for disease protection. Location and widths of the CIs as 
displayed in the corresponding figures of the CSR have a strong potential to mislead the interpretation of 
the actual response data for the 7 additional serotypes, with a clear systematic tendency for 
overestimation of the 20vPnC benefit. This is further aggravated using different assays for the 13 shared 
and the 7 additional serotypes, respectively, and the inadequacy to quantitatively compare titres. 
Consequently, the current approach hampers the interpretation of titres for the 7 additional serotypes in 
comparison to that of the 13 shared serotypes. Due to the above-mentioned shortcomings, additional 
immunogenicity response variables for which corresponding comparative analyses do not rely on so many 
arbitrary assumptions [e.g., GMFR and Proportions of Participants with ≥ 4 fold rise (IgG, OPA)] have also 
taken into consideration during assessment.
B7471014 was a single-arm trial which evaluated immunogenicity of a single dose of 20vPnC 
administered to participants ≥15 months to <5 years of age previously immunised with 13vPnC and 
participants ≥5 years to <18 years of age (regardless of previous vaccination with 7vPnC or 13vPnC) with 
respect to the 7 additional serotypes. The single-arm design of this study has already been questioned

during two scientific advice procedures. In addition, it appears that based on the results of this study, the 
MAH claims a broader indication. The information in the SmPC should reflect data available for Prevenar 
20, with a reference which recommendations are based on experience with Prevenar 13. 
Results and additional analyses
In both pivotal studies, the inclusion criterion was that infants are born at >36 weeks of gestation. No 
immunogenicity data is available for preterm infants.
In B7471012 (3-dose series), there were 3 primary pneumococcal immunogenicity endpoints: 1) 
Percentages of participants with predefined IgG concentrations after Dose 2, 2) Pneumococcal serotype-
specific IgG GMCs after Dose 2 and 3) pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG GMCs after Dose 3. In 
B7471011 (4-dose series), there were two primary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives: 
Percentages of participants with predefined IgG concentrations after Dose 3 (last infant dose), and 
Pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG GMCs after Dose 4 (toddler dose).
Both pivotal trials failed to meet their primary objectives as non-inferiority was not met for each of the 20 
serotypes, for all co-primary endpoints (as required per respective study protocols). In B7471012 15/60 
statistical tests failed, while in B7471011 6/40 tests failed. Both pivotal trials are thus considered formally 
failed.
The comparison of immune responses after last infant dose is considered the most sensitive time point to 
detect differences between vaccines. Results after the last infant dose are therefore presented separately 
from the results after the toddler dose, using both response rate and IgG GMC as main parameters of 
interest. 
It is noted that assessment of percentage of participants with pre-defined IgG concentrations is based on 
thresholds initially provided by the Applicant, not endorsed by the CHMP and thus additional analyses 
were requested. Although the point estimates and the corresponding confidence intervals differed from 
the initially submitted analyses, the overall results were not substantially different, and the conclusions 
are maintained. 
Immune response after last infant dose 
B7471012 (3-dose series)
In B7471012, in total 11/20 serotypes missed the NI criterion for response rate, and 4/20 serotypes 
missed the NI criterion for IgG GMC 1 month after last infant dose in the 3-dose series (Dose 2). 
Immune response was numerically lower in the 20vPnC group compared to 13vPnC group for all 13 
shared serotypes, including those for which the NI criteria were met, as measured by both response rate 
and IgG GMC. Regarding response rates, the point estimates for majority of shared serotypes lay below 
the NI margin of -10%, and for serotypes 3, 6B and 23F, respective 95% CI lay entirely below the NI 
margin of -10%. Regarding IgG GMCs, the point estimates for IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) ranged from 
0.51 (serotype 6B) to 0.82 (serotype 14). Importantly, for most shared serotypes in 20vPnC group, the 
IgG GMCs were very close to or even below the pre-defined cut-offs. In the 13vPnC group, IgG GMCs 
were generally higher and above the pre-defined cut-offs for most serotypes. Additional parameters after 
Dose 2 (RCDC, OPA GMTs) were overall consistent with primary endpoints i.e., numerically lower values 
were observed with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC for majority of shared serotypes.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 137/198
Two of the 7 additional serotypes (10A and 12F) failed the NI criterion for the response rate, whereas all 
met the NI criterion for the IgG GMC. The comparison of IgG GMC for the 7 additional serotypes was 
made for serotype 6B in 13vPnC group was strikingly similar to IgG GMC measured for serotype 15B in 
13vPnC group (0.06 vs. 0.04 μg/mL), although the latter is not included in 13vPnC. Of note, for 3 
additional serotypes (10A, 12F and 33F), the point estimates for IgG GMC were below the cut-off of 0.35 
μg/mL.  The NI testing setup for the 7 additional serotypes is not considered sufficiently informative and 
has a strong potential to mislead the interpretation of the actual response data for the 7 additional 
serotypes, with a clear systematic tendency for overestimation of the 20vPnC benefit. Hence, the position 
and width of the 95% CIs for additional serotypes in the forest plots must be interpreted with caution due 
to the potential of overestimation. For this reason, failure to meet NI criteria is particularly concerning. 
Furthermore, taking into consideration additional uncertainties with assays for the 7 additional serotypes 
discussed in the pharmacology section, as well as the dubious applicability of the IgG concentration of 
≥0.35 μg/mL as a surrogate of protection for the additional serotypes, the immune response to the 7 
additional serotypes is difficult to assess by means of parameters of primary interest (i.e., response rate 
and IgG GMC). IgG fold-rises are considered more reliable parameters; however, these were not 
presented from before Dose 2 to after Dose 2. Of note, IgG GMC before Dose 2 was measured only in a 
subset of participants. IgG GMCs and OPA titres for all 7 additional serotypes were higher than the IgG 
GMCs and OPA titres for the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC group (including OPA titres for 
serotypes 10A and 12F), which shows that 7 additional serotype elicit serotype-specific immune 
responses and offers mild reassurance as regards the potential benefit of these additional 7 serotypes.
B7471011 (4-dose series)
In B7471011, in total 6/20 serotypes missed the NI criterion for response rate; NI criterion was met for 
all serotypes for IgG GMC after last infant dose in the 4-dose series (Dose 3). 
Like the 3-dose series, immune response in the 4-dose series was numerically lower in the 20vPnC group 
compared to 13vPnC group for all 13 shared serotypes, including those for which the NI criteria were 
met, as measured by both response rate and IgG GMC. The difference between vaccines in the 4-dose 
regimen was less pronounced than after the last infant dose in 3-dose regimen. The point estimates for 
majority of shared serotypes lay above the NI margin of -10%; only for serotype 3 the 95% CI lay 
entirely below the NI margin of -10%, suggesting potential benefit of an additional dose in the primary 
series. In contrast, the point estimates for IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.60 (serotype 6B) to 
0.79 (serotypes 14, 19A and 19F), which is in a similar range as with the 3-dose regimen. Nonetheless, 
for most serotypes (except serotype 3), the IgG GMCs were well above the pre-defined cut-offs in 
contrast to 3-dose regimen where majority of serotypes were below the predefined cut-offs. 
As regards the 7 additional serotypes, same uncertainties as described above apply here. Serotype 12F 
missed the NI criterion for the response rate, and the entire 95% CI lay below the NI margin of -10%. No 
fold-rises from before Dose 3 to after Dose 3 were presented. IgG GMCs all 7 additional serotypes were 
much higher than the IgG GMCs and OPA titres for the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC group 
(including OPA titres for serotypes 10A and 12F), which shows that 7 additional serotype elicit serotype-
specific immune responses and offers some reassurance as regards the benefit of the additional 7 
serotypes. This difference was also more pronounced than in the 3-dose series. 
Immune response after toddler dose 
B7471012 (3-dose series)
After administration of toddler dose, differences between 20vPnC and 13vPnC generally decreased. 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 138/198
Only serotype 6B missed the NI criterion for IgG GMC, other shared serotypes met the NI criterion for 
IgG GMC. Non-inferiority was not formally tested for the response rate after Dose3. For the 13 matched 
serotypes, the observed differences (20vPnC–13vPnC) in response rate ranged from -10.6% (2-sided 
95% CI: -14.7%, -6.7%) for serotype 3 to 1.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -0.5%, 2.7%) for serotype 18C). No 
substantial differences were seen between vaccines for the response rate except for the serotype 3, which 
had a lower bound <-10% at this time point. In contrast, numerically lower IgG GMCs were observed for 
majority of shared serotypes with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC, despite meeting the NI criterion. The 
surrogate of protection was achieved by majority of participants for the shared serotypes. Further 
clarification was provided regarding the bridging between the assays used for the 13 shared serotypes in 
20vPnC studies compared to the WHO ELISA. OPA GMTs are overall consistent with the results observed 
for IgG GMC i.e., numerically lower titres were measured with 20vPnC. Based on IgG GMFRs, two 
vaccines showed similar pattern at different time points and similar boosting potential. The boosting 
effect based on OPA GMFR was somewhat higher for 13vPnC compared to 20vPnC for all serotypes.
NI was shown for all additional 7 serotypes as assessed by the IgG GMC. The observed response rate 
ranged from 96.6% (serotype 12F) to 99.4% (serotype 15B). However, these results have to be 
interpreted with reservations. IgG (and OPA) GMFRs are considered more reliable variables. IgG GMFR for 
additional serotypes from before Dose 3 to after Dose 3 ranged from 12.7 (serotype 8) to 16.5 (serotype 
12F) in the 20vPnC group and were broadly comparable with GMFRs of the 13 serotypes. The percentages 
of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in IgG concentrations from before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 
83.5% (serotype 15B) to 95.5% (serotype 12F) in the 20vPnC group. The percentages of participants 
with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from before to 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 47.0% (serotype 33F) 
to 92.2% (serotype 22F) in the 20vPnC group. Very few participants had ≥4-fold- rises in IgG GMC or 
OPA titres for the 7 additional serotypes in the 13vPnC group, as expected. 
The antibody concentration declined from 1 month after Dose 2 to before Dose 3, which ranged similarly 
in both groups and increased again after administration of toddler dose to levels higher than post Dose 2. 
This indicated that immune memory is induced. 
B7471011 (4-dose series)
Consistent with observations for the 3-dose series, after administration of toddler dose, differences 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC generally decreased. The NI criterion for IgG GMRs after Dose 4 was met 
for all shared and all additional serotypes. Results for the response rate were presented only 
descriptively. Although NI was not formally tested for this endpoint, for serotype 3 the point estimate for 
the difference in response rate was below -10% (-12.1%, 95% CI -16.2, -8.1%). The percentage of 
participants who achieved the pre-defined cut-off for the serotype 3 was 73.6% in the 20vPnC group 
compared to 85.8% in the 13vPnC group. For majority of shared serotypes in both groups, the IgG GMCs 
were well above the pre-defined cut-offs. 
IgG GMFRs for additional serotypes from before Dose 4 to after Dose 4 ranged from 8.1 (serotypes 10A 
and 15B) to 10.0 (serotype 12F) in the 20vPnC group and were broadly comparable with GMFRs of the 13 
serotypes. The percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in IgG concentrations from before to 1 
month after Dose 4 ranged from 77.6% (serotype 15B) to 90.6% (serotype 12F) in the 20vPnC group.  
Interestingly, these proportions were lower compared to those after toddler dose in the 3-dose regimen. 
Very few participants had ≥4-fold- rises for the 7 additional serotypes in the 13vPnC group, as expected. 
For the 7 additional serotypes, the percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from 
before to 1 month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC ranged from 57.8% (serotype 33F) to 86.8% (serotype 22F).

In conclusion, following administration of toddler dose, IgG GMCs and the response rates increased 
compared to measurements after last infant dose in both vaccine groups. Whilst the immune response to 
20vPnC was still lower compared to 13vPnC, differences between vaccines were less pronounced.
In both pivotal studies, antibody responses to concomitant vaccination with common infant vaccines were 
assessed. These analyses indicate that the immunogenicity of concomitant vaccination is similar when 
administered with 20vPnC or the authorised 13vPnC. 
Overall immunogenicity data on 3-dose and 4-dose regimen
Significant differences between vaccines were observed after the last infant dose in the 3-dose regimen, 
demonstrated by multiple (15/40) failed NI tests for both primary endpoints (response rate and IgG 
GMC). Differences between vaccines were also observed after the last infant dose in the 4-dose regimen, 
albeit to a lesser extent. Given that the highest burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in paediatric 
population is in infants <1 year of age (ECDC Invasive pneumococcal disease - Annual Epidemiological 
Report for 2017, 2018), it is crucial that vaccines offer sufficient protection in the window between the 
last infant and the toddler dose (between 4-5 and 11-12 months of age). 
Furthermore, a substantial disease burden at this age is also due to pneumonia and acute otitis media 
(AOM). As there is only a surrogate of protection available for IPD but not for pneumonia or AOM it is 
difficult to interpret the clinical impact of these lower titres on the protection against pneumonia and 
AOM. Moreover, higher antibody responses are thought to be necessary for the protection against 
pneumonia and AOM compared to IPD, as the protection should take place at the mucosal level or the ear 
instead of blood. 
Considering the above-mentioned, the adequacy of the 2+1 regimen to achieve and maintain protection, 
especially in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose raises major concerns. The cross-
study comparison, with direct comparisons between 20vPnC and 13vPnc within each study, indicate that 
the 3+1 regimen is more likely to achieve and maintain antibody levels above the threshold value for IgG 
between the last infant and the toddler dose. The available OPA data paint a similar picture. The MAH was 
asked to provide a thorough justification that, despite multiple failed NI tests and many serotypes being 
below the predefined cut-off for a protective level, the 3-dose regimen of 20vPnC offers sufficient 
protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in infants between the last infant and the toddler dose, 
particularly against severe courses of the disease. In addition, the MAH was asked to provide an elaborate 
justification for the 3-dose regimen, given overall better immune responses elicited after the last infant 
dose with 4-dose regimen.
In the response, the Applicant disputed the suitability of the IgG concentration threshold of 0.35 µg/mL 
for the purpose of inferring protection after 2 infant doses, given that this threshold was defined based on 
IgG concentrations after 3 infant doses; and argues that no IgG concentration threshold is established 
after 2 infant doses. Considering these limitations, the Applicant emphasised the importance of totality of 
data. It should be noted that CHMP considered the totality of data during assessment. It is stressed 
however, that the primary analysis should be based on IgG concentrations 4 weeks after completion of 
the primary infant immunization series; whereas analyses after the toddler dose are intended to detect 
whether an immune memory response has been induced during the infant immunisation series.
The Applicant further argued that the use of the 3-dose regimen substantially relies on the benefits of 
indirect protection elicited via high uptake of the toddler dose. As most of the European countries have 
high PCV uptake, the 13vPnC vaccine-type transmission levels are low, subsequently leading to indirect 
protection of unvaccinated persons of all age as well as incompletely vaccinated infants <1 year. Thus, 
the Applicant considers that despite the numerically lower immunogenicity with 20vPnC, infants 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 140/198
vaccinated with 3-dose regimen would not have a greater risk of 13vPnC vaccine-type IPD than infants 
vaccinated with 4-dose regimen as because they would be rarely exposed to vaccine serotypes. As the 
Applicant points out, currently in European countries 13vPnC-type IPD incidence is extremely low, 
suggesting low levels of 13vPnC transmission. However, the low IPD incidence and low levels of 
transmission are the result of effective vaccines on the market. As it is expected that 20vPnC would 
replace 13vPnC, given many uncertainties with the effectiveness of 20vPnC, it is unknown if the same 
level of herd immunity will be maintained. 
Furthermore, the Applicant also put emphasis on previous experience with Prevenar 13, which, despite 
lower immunogenicity compared to 7vPnC observed during Prevenar13 registration studies, demonstrated 
to be effective in the post-marketing setting. However, the same does not necessarily applies to 20vPnC 
and cannot be used as argument, providing benefit of the doubt to Prevenar 20. These uncertainties are 
not restricted to one or two serotypes but pertain to all serotypes included in the vaccine. Furthermore, it 
remains unclear if a further reduction of antibody titres is still effective in prevention of disease.
The Applicant put focus on the non-inferiority analyses and the potential benefit of the 7 additional 
serotypes. It should be reiterated that substantial parts of the concern of the markedly lower 
immunogenicity compared to Prevenar-13 results from the poor immune response data for the 13 shared 
serotypes. The key requirement for a MAA is the successful bridging for the 13 shared serotypes in 
accordance with the immunobridging approach. The potential benefit of the 7 additional serotypes is not 
sufficient to offset the uncertainties related to the lower immunogenicity for the shared serotypes. 
Additionally, several limitations associated with the interpretation of the data for the 7 additional 
serotypes further contribute to the uncertainties regarding the actual benefit of the additional serotypes. 
Given that the basis for this procedure is immunobridging to Prevenar-13, the additional trade-off 
analyses are not considered relevant. Even if such analyses might be considered, several assumptions 
and the methodology used in these trade-off analyses are not acceptable. Similarly, additional indirect 
comparisons to PCV-10 are not deemed relevant or suitable to counterbalance uncertainties arising from 
a direct comparison with Prevenar-13 within the current application.
In a nutshell, additional arguments did not alter the initial conclusion that the Benefit/Risk for the 3-dose 
regimen is considered negative. In contrast, given the overall better immunogenicity, the 4-dose regimen 
is more likely to achieve protection; this would however need to be confirmed in the post-marketing. This 
pertains to all serotypes contained in 20vPnC in general, and particularly to the 7 additional serotypes for 
which the interpretation of immunogenicity data was severely limited. 
The Applicant proposed a multicountry IPD surveillance study to evaluate the effectiveness of 20vPnC 
against IPD. Following a feasibility assessment, the applicant determined that the indirect cohort method 
would be the preferred approach for evaluating direct vaccine effectiveness. An important limitation for 
the planned commitment is that the evaluation of 20vPnC effectiveness post-authorisation is contingent 
on the recommendation of 20vPnC for children according to the authorised posology and that the vaccine 
is used for several years. In addition, the Applicant confirmed that a respective study in the US is 
planned. Overall, the presented plans for confirming VE appear acceptable, however some specific 
aspects such as VE against 7 additional serotypes and the basis for the sample size calculations are 
missing. A detailed protocol proposal for CHMP approval should be provided before commencing the post-
authorisation studies (REC). The final study results should be provided in the respective post-
authorisation procedure (type II variation). The Applicant committed to submitting the requested 
information.

Supportive studies
Study B7471014
Study B7471014 provides some evidence on immunogenicity of 7 additional serotypes elicited by 20vPnC 
when administered as a single dose to infants previously vaccinated with at least 3 doses of 13vPnC and 
when administered as a single dose to children 5 to less than 18 years of age regardless of prior 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. However, it is unclear whether a single (priming) dose of 20vPnC is 
sufficient to achieve protection against the 7 extra serotypes and induces robust immunological memory.  
The incidence of paediatric pneumococcal disease declines with age, particularly in children >5 years of 
age. Though IPD is infrequent in this age group, the proportion of reported cases due to 20vPnC 
serotypes in some European countries is not considered irrelevant. A single dose of 20vPnC elicited 
immune response in all age subgroups. Whether the elicited immune response is sufficient to provide 
protection against pneumococcal disease due to additional 7 serotypes and how long this protection lasts 
is not determined. Nonetheless, a single dose of 20vPnC has a potential to offer some level of additional 
protection which could be important for subjects at high risk of pneumococcal disease. Therefore, a single 
dose of Prevenar 20 may be considered on an individual basis. As regards the potential protection against 
otitis media and pneumonia, no conclusions can be made based on provided data, since no correlate of 
protection for these indications and antibody concentrations that prevent otitis media are likely to be 
higher than those needed to protect against IPD. It should be noted that no safety data is available for 
paediatric population at higher risk of pneumococcal disease for Prevenar 20. However, based on 
experience with Prevenar13, it is not expected to be considerably worse compared to the healthy 
population. 
Concomitant vaccinations
Antibody responses to concomitant vaccines were similar after vaccination with 13vPnC or 20vPnC across 
all studies. For instance, NI of 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC was demonstrated by the percentages of 
participants with pre-specified antibody levels to diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B virus, 
poliovirus, and Hib vaccine antigens at 1 month after dose 3 as well as the GMRs of antibody levels to 
MMR and varicella vaccine antigens at 1 month after dose 4 (B7471011). Hence, data provided indicate 
that the immunogenicity of concomitant vaccination with the specified vaccines is similar between 20vPnC 
and the approved 13vPnC. Since all participants received the respective concomitant vaccines, no 
conclusions can be drawn regarding potential differences between separate and concomitant vaccinations.
Additional expert consultation
The CHMP convened a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) inviting the experts to provide their views on the 
immunogenicity results for the 2+1 regimen, discuss the following questions:
1. How do you evaluate the potential benefit of the seven added serotypes in the context 
of the EU epidemiological situation?
The experts noted the position of the MAH that most of the remaining paediatric invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) burden is due to serotypes not included in 13-valent or 15-valent PCV. With PCV20 one 
could potentially address this residual disease burden by expanding protection to additional prevalent and 
medically important serotypes in Europe. As per data presented by the MAH for 2019, PCV20 covered 33-
35% more paediatric IPD than PCV13 and 24-25% more than PCV15 in the EU (ECDC, 2019). 
Experts concurred that there are reasons to believe that there is a potential benefit with the new vaccine, 
acknowledging the opportunity for prevention regarding the additional serotypes.  However, it is difficult 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 142/198
to estimate the magnitude of this effect in the post-pandemic (COVID-19) period.  It was noted that there 
are issues regarding the stated epidemiological figures because these are based on data from 2019 and 
do not reflect the recent evolution in epidemiology, representing the post-pandemic reality; hence the 
overall benefit of the seven added serotypes remains to be elucidated; e.g., from data in infants recently 
obtained in Spain, serotype 10A prevalence is recorded as relatively high and serotype 3, already 
included in PCV13, has been also seen in severe cases and vaccine-breakthrough infections. National IPD 
surveillance data (2022) from Spain (with PCV-13 coverage > 98 % in paediatric immunisation scheme) 
found that 11.5% of IPD in children <2 years of age was due to the serotype 3 (similar to figure for 
serotype 10A). For this serotype, immune response has been shown to be much lower in the 2+1 
vaccination regimens than in 3+1 schemes. Since for serotype 10A also an obviously lower IgG response 
is shown after two infant doses of Prevenar 20, this observation remains a concern for adequate 
protection of the 6-11 months aged, and moreover in respect to the high-risk groups, including e.g., 
immunosuppressed, and premature born for whom adequate data on immunogenicity remains lacking.  
The experts also acknowledged the argumentation that booster effect with toddler dose could reduce 
carriage of vaccine type S. pneumoniae and thus ultimately may indirectly protect infants and the overall 
population.  They however asserted that the magnitude of such benefit remains difficult to estimate since 
the impact on carriage is still unknown, and the ultimate benefit may be short lived due to potential 
serotype replacement phenomenon.
2. To what extent do the immunogenicity results for the 2+1 regimen cause concerns of 
lower protection against the serotypes already included in Prevenar 13?
The MAH argued that although the serotypes missing non-inferiority (NI) for at least one primary 
objective post-infant series may create some uncertainty, data may not be judged in isolation. IgG 
responses from post-toddler dose and additional immunogenicity parameters after dose 2 and dose 3 
(OPA, boosting of IgG and OPA, comparability of IgG distribution for PCV13 and PCV20 recipients) for all 
shared serotypes, provide reassurance of overall expected impact of PCV20.  It was highlighted that the 
implementation challenges for a PCV20 3+1 as the only regimen in the EU could potentially be 
detrimental as a barrier, –acknowledging that the majority of EU countries presently use a 2+1 schedule 
for PCV-, denying protection against vaccine preventable serotypes in some EU countries.
The experts assessed if based on the main immunogenicity parameters, the 2 infant dose regimen (2+1) 
for PCV20 is adequate to achieve memory and potentially reduce carriage and in this way maintain 
indirect protection, especially in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose: 9/13 shared 
serotypes failed NI for the response rate, 4/13 shared serotypes failed NI for IgG GMC. The clinical 
implications of these findings are difficult to judge in absence of a known threshold for protection and 
carriage reduction.  Experts also stressed that data need judging in relation to the entire pneumococcal 
disease spectrum, thus including non-invasive disease, which constitutes most of the disease burden and 
depends on prevention of acquisition and carriage of vaccine-serotypes.   
In conclusion, in terms of immunogenicity data, experts judged that there seems a clear benefit for the 
3+1 dosage regimen versus 2+1 schedule, although the larger loss of immunogenicity with the 2+1 
regimen is difficult to discern in terms of consequences for effectiveness regarding IPD as well as non-
invasive disease and indirect protection through carriage reduction. It was noted that potentially a higher 
level of antibodies would be warranted to protect against acute otitis media and pneumonia. Overall, the 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244

above constitute important uncertainties whether the 2+1 schedule with PCV20 may provide optimal 
protection against the spectrum of pneumococcal disease.
2.4.3.  Conclusions on immunogenicity
Both pivotal trials failed to meet their primary objectives as non-inferiority was not met for each of the 20 
serotypes for all co-primary endpoints. In B7471012 15/60 statistical tests failed, while in B7471011 6/40 
tests failed. Both pivotal trials are thus considered formally failed.
Overall, 20vPnC was immunogenic in all studies and induced a serotype-specific immune response to all 
20 serotypes included in the vaccine. Nonetheless, the immune response for the 13 shared serotypes was 
consistently lower in the 20vPnC group compared to 13vPnC group for all serotypes in both 3-dose and 4-
dose regimen. Significant differences between vaccines were observed after the last infant dose in the 3-
dose regimen, demonstrated by multiple (15/40) failed NI tests for both primary parameters, response 
rate and IgG GMC. Differences between vaccines were also observed after last infant dose in 4-dose 
regimen, as well as after toddler dose in both 3-dose and 4-dose regimen, albeit to a lesser extent. 
The CHMP concurs with the (WHO) statement “that missing the statistical NI criteria for individual 
serotypes for one or both sets of criteria do not necessarily predict lack of vaccine efficacy” and may not 
be completely unexpected due to the sheer number of NI comparisons made. However, from the 
assessment perspective, it is important that this uncertainty in prediction would also not rule out a 
clinically relevant lack of vaccine efficacy, because of failed NI in IgG response. The key issue in this 
context remains the fact that – in absence of a reliable correlate of protection – the whole setup of the 
immunology NI evaluation relies on many pre-specifications and assumptions (e.g. IgG-concentration 
threshold for binary response description, width of NI-margins, etc), such that actual NI conclusions 
(positive or negative) need to be per se considered rather uninformative as regards disease protective 
potential (vaccine efficacy).
Furthermore, the approach for NI comparisons of the 7 additional serotypes against the lowest observed 
response among the vaccine serotypes in the 13vPnC group (excluding serotype 3) is considered rather 
uninformative and might even be potentially misleading, with a systematic tendency for overestimation of 
the 20vPnC benefit. Although, the assessment of secondary parameters such as IgG and OPA GMFRs 
clearly shows that 7 additional parameters induce serotype-specific immune response, it remains unclear 
whether elicited titres are indeed effective against disease. 
Finally, due to the overall lower IgG GMCs with 20vPnC, it can be expected that the (assumed) protective 
effect wanes earlier compared to 13vPnC. 
Given that the highest burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in paediatric population is in infants <1 
year of age (ECDC Invasive pneumococcal disease - Annual Epidemiological Report for 2017, 2018), it is 
crucial that vaccines offer sufficient protection in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose 
(between 4-5 and 11-12 months of age). Furthermore, a substantial disease burden at this age is also 
due to pneumonia and acute otitis media. As there is only a surrogate of protection available for IPD but 
not for pneumonia or AOM it is difficult to interpret the clinical impact of these lower titres on the 
protection against pneumonia and AOM. Moreover, higher antibody responses are thought to be 
necessary for the protection against pneumonia and AOM compared to IPD, as the protection should take 
place at the mucosal level or the ear instead of blood. Considering the above-mentioned, the adequacy of 
the 2+1 regimen to achieve and maintain protection, especially in the window between the last infant and 
the toddler dose raises major concerns.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 144/198
The cross-study comparison, with direct comparisons between 20vPnC and 13vPnc within each study, 
indicate that the 3 infant + 1 toddler schedule (3+1) is likely to achieve and maintain antibody levels 
above the threshold value for IgG between the last infant and the toddler dose. The Applicant had to 
justify that, despite multiple failed NI tests and majority of serotypes being below the predefined cut-off 
for a protective level, the 3-dose regimen of 20vPnC offers sufficient protection against invasive 
pneumococcal disease in infants between the last infant and the toddler dose, particularly against severe 
courses of the disease. Also, the Applicant was requested to provide an elaborate justification for the 3-
dose regimen, given overall better immune responses elicited after the last infant dose with 4-dose 
regimen. The additional arguments provided by the Applicant did not dissipate major concerns regarding 
the efficacy of the 2+1 regimen. These uncertainties are not restricted to one or two serotypes but 
pertain to all serotypes included in the vaccine. 
In contrast, given the overall better immunogenicity, the 4-dose regimen is more likely to achieve 
protection; this would however need to be confirmed in the post-marketing. The Applicant confirmed that 
a global study to evaluate 20vPnC effectiveness against vaccine-type IPD administered according to the 
vaccine schedule(s) that will be licensed in the EU is feasible and ensured that substantial progress was 
made in establishing an IPD surveillance network for this purpose. In addition, the Applicant confirmed 
that a respective study in the US is planned. 
As regards other claimed indications, it should be noted that a surrogate of protection, IgG of 0.35 µg/mL 
after 3 infant doses, has been established in children for IPD only and applies to the 13 shared serotypes. 
No correlate or surrogate of protection exists for pneumonia and AOM. Therefore, the strategy of NI 
testing for 20vPnC to 13vPnC, especially when a lower immune response is observed with 20vPnC 
compared to 13vPnC introduces the possibility that 20vPnC might not be effective in these indications. 
Further, it is currently unknown whether the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL can also be considered protective 
for the new serotypes included in this vaccine for any indication. 
Overall conclusion: The immunogenicity data of the 3-dose regimen are considered insufficient to 
recommend approval of this dose regimen for paediatric patients. While post-approval effectiveness 
evaluation can be used to address some uncertainties present at the time of the assessment, pre-
approval immunogenicity data should be sufficiently convincing. However, in case of the 3-dose regimen 
immunogenicity data raise substantial concerns that preclude the recommendation of this regimen.
Given the overall better immunogenicity results, the 4-dose regimen is more likely to provide protection 
against the pneumococcal disease. The VE of the 4-dose regimen needs to be confirmed in the post-
marketing, including the VE of the 7 additional serotypes, as the interpretation of data from pivotal 
studies regarding these serotypes was severely limited. The Applicant agreed to conduct a Phase 4 
observational, real-world study of the 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. This study will use 
surveillance data to evaluate the effectiveness of 20vPnC used in a 3+1 schedule against invasive 
pneumococcal disease in children. Detailed protocol proposals for EMA agreement should be provided 
before commencing the studies. The final study results should be reflected via the respective post-
authorisation procedure (type II variation).
Recommendation [REC]
The Applicant will provide detailed protocol proposals for EMA approval before commencing the studies 
(REC). The final study results should be provided in the respective post-authorisation procedure (type II

2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Overview of 20vPnC paediatric clinical trials: 
The 20vPnC paediatric clinical development program was designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in infants and children <18 years of age. 
-
Infants were evaluated in one Phase 3 trial (B7471012) conducted using a 3-dose schedule and 
two Phase 3 trials (B7471011 and B7471013) and one Phase 2 trial (B7471003) conducted using 
a 4-dose schedule. 
-
Another Phase 3 trial (B7471014) studied a single dose of 20vPnC administered to children ≥15 
months to <5 years of age previously immunized with at least 3 doses of 13vPnC and children ≥5 
to <18 years of years of age regardless of previous pneumococcal conjugate vaccination.
Five clinical trials support this submission regarding safety and tolerability of 20vPnC: 

Four Phase 3 trials:

B7471012 – Pivotal double-blind, active-controlled Phase 3 trial of safety and 
immunogenicity in infants randomized 1:1 to receive a 3-dose series of either 20vPnC or 
13vPnC at approximately 2 to 3, 4 to 5, and 11 to 12 months of age, conducted in Europe 
and Australia
B7471011 – Double-blind, active-controlled Phase 3 trial of safety and immunogenicity in 
infants randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose series of either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, 
and 12 to 15 months of age, conducted in the USA and the US territory of Puerto Rico
B7471013 – Double-blind, Phase 3 trial of tolerability and safety in infants randomized, 
2:1 to receive a 4-dose series of either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months 
of age, conducted in multiple countries
B7471014 – Single-arm, Phase 3 trial of safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of 
20vPnC in children from ≥15 months to <18 years of age, conducted in the USA; children 
≥15 months to <5 years of age in this trial had documentation of at least 3 doses of 
13vPnC prior to enrolment
 One Phase 2 trial:

o
B7471003 – Double-blind, active-controlled Phase 2 trial of safety and immunogenicity in 
infants randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose series of either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, 
and 12 months of age, conducted in the USA
Routine concomitant paediatric vaccines were also administered in these studies.
Data Pooling: 
For an integrated analysis of safety, AE data were pooled from the Phase 2 (B7471003) and the Phase 3 
infant trials (B7471012, B7471011, and B7471013) as these trials collect similar safety data and have 
similar study populations and designs (randomized, double-blinded, with the same active control of 
[13vPnC], and same safety follow-up time frame [6 months after last dose, except for B7471012 which 
was 1 month after last dose]). 
For local reactions and systemic events, B7471012 (3-dose series) data are summarized separately from 
the combined data for the other 3 trials (4-dose series) conducted in infants due to the different 
administration schedules. Additionally, where applicable, data were pooled across the infant trials and 
B7471014 conducted in children ≥15 months to <18 years of age to summarize specific safety 
parameters to provide a complete overview of events across all paediatric ages studied.
The pooling strategy is as follows:
Local reaction, systemic event, and AE data from children ≥2 years to <18 years of age from B7471014 
are described separately.
Safety Parameters: 
The methods and the timeframes for safety data collection and analysis were similar in all trials. Safety 
was evaluated based on the following parameters:

Specific events occurring within 7 days after vaccination were prompted for and collected by the 
participants’ parents/legal guardians in an e-diary, device, or application. These events included:
o
local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site)
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 147/198
o
systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability in 
infants and toddlers ≥6 weeks to <24 months of age; and fever, fatigue, headache, 
muscle pain, and joint pain in children ≥2 to <18 years of age)



Immediate AEs occurring within the first 30 minutes after each vaccination
AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 or Dose 3 (the last study-specified infant dose) 
and from the study-specified toddler dose (Dose 3 or Dose 4) to 1 month after the toddler dose (the 
toddler dose summary also includes the single dose of 20vPnC in toddlers ≥15 to <24 months of 
age with at least 3 prior doses of 13vPnC from B7471014 [Cohort 1]); and within 1 month after the 
single 20vPnC dose for children ≥2 to <18 years of age
SAEs reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3/last dose for B7471012, and from Dose 1 
through 6 months after Dose 4/last dose in B7471003, B7471011, B7471013, and the single 20vPnC 
dose in B7471014
Safety Data Analyses: 
Descriptive summary statistics were provided for each vaccine group for most safety parameters. 
A 3-tier approach was used to summarize the integrated AEs across trials. Between-group differences 
(20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages of local reactions, systemic events, and Tier 2 AEs were also assessed 
(without including participants from B7471014, which has no control group). For the summary of between 
group difference in percentages across multiple studies, the study-adjusted between-group difference and 
the corresponding 95% CI for the difference were calculated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen 
method with inverse-variance stratum weights for individual studies.
Participants were included in the vaccine group corresponding to the vaccine that was actually 
administered. For summarization, AEs were categorized according to the MedDRA, by SOC and PT.
Patient exposure
Across all 5 trials, 5987 participants received at least 1 dose of study vaccine: 3664 received 20vPnC and 
2323 received control 13vPnC.
One participant in B7471013 who was randomized to 13vPnC but received 20vPnC at Dose 1 and was 
excluded from the integrated summary of safety results.
In the 4 infant trials (B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, and B7471013), 5156 participants (not counting 
the participant in B7471013 who was randomized to 13vPnC but received 20vPnC at Dose 1) received at 
least 1 dose of study vaccine: 2833 received 20vPnC and 2323 received 13vPnC.
Overall, approximately 90% of participants in each group received all doses through the study-specified 
toddler dose.
The numbers of vaccinated participants in the 5 paediatric trials are shown by pooled dataset, vaccine 
group, and dose administered in the following table. Three participants in B7471011 who were 
randomized to 13vPnC but received 20vPnC after Dose 1 (2 at Dose 2 and 1 at Dose 4) were excluded 
from the integrated summary starting from the first analysis period the incorrect vaccine occurred.
In study B7471014, 831 participants received a single dose of 20vPnC:

in B7471011) and are included in the total exposure rows but excluded from the exposure rows for the dose with incorrect study 
vaccine administration and the subsequent doses. Local reactions and systemic events collected from participants after the incorrect 
study vaccine administration are excluded from the summary tables and figures for that and all subsequent doses. Adverse events from 
participants who received any incorrect study vaccination in a specified reporting time period are excluded from the summary tables

of the schedule and duration of follow-up for a given participant was more than 15 months. The most 
frequent reasons for withdrawal of participants were lost to follow-up and withdrawal by parent/guardian.

Across all 5 trials, 12 (0.2%) participants withdrew from the trials due to AEs: 9 (0.3%) infants who 
received 20vPnC and 3 (0.1%) infants who received 13vPnC. 
The types of AEs most frequently resulting in withdrawal of these infants were seizures/seizure-
associated conditions (three 20vPnC [0.1%] recipients and one 13vPnC recipient [<0.1%]) and failure to 
thrive (two 20vPnC [0.1%] recipients and one 13vPnC recipient [<0.1%]). In general, participants with 
seizures/seizure-associated conditions were often withdrawn due to questions of continued eligibility.
Demographic Characteristics
Participant demographic characteristics (sex, race, ethnicity, country, age at Dose 1 and at the study-
specified Dose 3/Dose 4 (toddler vaccination), for the pooled datasets are summarized in Table 57.
Within each pooled population, demographic characteristics were generally comparable between 
participants who received 20vPnC and those who received 13vPnC.
Across all 5 trials, there were similar percentages of male and female participants among the 20vPnC 
recipients and the 13vPnC recipients. Overall, 83.5% of 20vPnC recipients were White, 7.9% Black, 1.6% 
Asian, and 24.0% Hispanic, with similar distribution among 13vPnC recipients.
Within B7471014, there was a higher percentage of a male participants than female participants ≥15 
months to <24 months of age (Cohort 1) and ≥10 to <18 years of age (Cohort 4) (~56% vs ~44%). 
Participants were predominantly White (80.1%–86.8%), with nearly all the other participants being Black 
or African American (8.3%–12.4%); 15.4% to 21.0% were Hispanic.

Adverse events 
Immediate Adverse Events occurring within the first 30 minutes after each vaccination 
In B7471012 (3-dose series), immediate AEs were reported infrequently (for ≤0.7% of participants after 
each dose in both vaccine groups). There were no immediate AEs reported after Dose 3 in the 13vPnC 
group. None of the immediate AEs represented serious allergic reactions to 20vPnC.
The percentages of pooled participants enrolled at <2 years of age with immediate AEs (within 30 
minutes) after each dose (0.1%–0.2%) were similar for 20vPnC and 13vPnC recipients in B7471003, 
B7471011, B7471012, B7471013 and B7471014 Cohort 1. Most of the events were in the General 
disorders and administration site conditions System Organ Class. There were no cases of immediate 
allergic reactions associated with bronchospasm, facial oedema, or generalized urticaria within 30 
minutes of vaccination. Events representing potential allergic reactions were infrequent (1 participant in 
the 20vPnC group had injection site hypersensitivity within 30 minutes after both Dose 2 and Dose 3). 
One case of stridor of mild severity was reported after Dose 2 of 20vPnC on the day of vaccination but 
had a duration of 50 days, which makes it unlikely for the event to represent an allergic reaction. There 
was no trend to increasing rates of immediate AEs with subsequent doses of vaccine. None of the 
immediate AEs resulted in withdrawal of the participants from the trial.
There were no immediate AEs (within 30 minutes of vaccination) in participants ≥2 to <18 years of age.

Note: MedDRA (v25.0) coding dictionary applied.
Note: Immediate AE refers to an AE reported in the 30-minute observation period after vaccination.
Note: One AE that began 33 minutes after Dose 1 and another AE that began 31 minutes after Dose 3 were included in this summary. 
Both AEs were from B7471012.
Note: Dose 3 (infant) is Dose 3 in B7471003, B7471011, and B7471013 trials combined. Dose 4/Dose 3 (toddler)/vaccination (toddler) 
comprises Dose 4 vaccination in B7471003, B7471011, and B7471013, and the single dose of 20vPnC in B7471014 Cohort 1 (children 
15 to <24 months of age with at least 3 prior infant doses of 13vPnC).
a. n = Number of participants reporting at least 1 occurrence of the specified event. For "any adverse event," n = number of 
participants reporting at least 1 occurrence of any specified event.
b. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
c. N = number of participants who received the specified dose. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculations.
Specific events occurring within 7 days after vaccination 
Specific events including local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and systemic 
events (fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability in infants and toddlers ≥6 
weeks to <24 months of age; and fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain in children ≥2 to 
<18 years of age) were collected by the participants’ parents/legal guardians in an e-diary, device, or 
application. 
Local Reactions in Infants and Toddlers
In B7471012 (3-dose series), the percentages of participants with local reactions (redness, swelling, 
or pain at the injection site) within 7 days after each of the 3 doses were generally similar after either 
20vPnC or 13vPnC, with no clinically important differences between the vaccine groups. Between-group 
differences (20vPnC – 13vPnC) ranged from -3.2% to 5.3%.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 153/198
Percentages of participants with local reactions were also generally similar after either 20vPnC or 13vPnC 
in the pooled infant population administered a 4-dose series (from B7471003, B7471011, and 
B7471013). Between-group differences (20vPnC – 13vPnC) ranged from -3.1% to 1.5%.
With both schedules, most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local reactions 
were reported infrequently (0–0.5%). There were no strong trends in severity of local reactions with 
subsequent doses.
With a 3-dose series, the most frequently reported local reaction was pain at the injection site 
(22.8%–42.4% in the 20vPnC group; 24.6%–39.9% in the 13vPnC group), followed by redness (25.3%–
36.9% in the 20vPnC; 27.5%–33.8% in the 13vPnC) and swelling (21.4%-29.8% in the 20vPnC group; 
20.2%–24.6% in the 13vPnC group).
Similarly, in the pooled population given a 4-dose series, the most frequently reported local reaction 
was pain at the injection site (32.8%–45.5% in the 20vPnC group, 34.6%–45.4% in the 13vPnC group), 
followed by redness (22.6%–24.5% in the 20vPnC group, 23.2%–25.7% in the 13vPnC group) and 
swelling (15.1%–17.6% in the 20vPnC group, 16.0%–18.0% in the 13vPnC group).
In B7471012 (3-dose series), the percentages of participants with any local reaction, particularly pain at 
the injection site and redness, were higher after the toddler dose than after the 2 infant doses. In 
the pooled infant population (4-dose series), percentages of participants with pain at the injection site 
generally decreased slightly after subsequent infant doses (from Doses 1–3).
The frequencies obtained for local reactions with each of the dosing schedules were similar, except for 
pain at the injection site, which was reported less frequently after any infant dose of the 3-dose series 
(22.8% [Dose 2]–29.4% [Dose 1]) than after any infant dose of the 4-dose schedule (32.8% [infant 
Dose 3]–45.5% [Dose 1]). After the toddler dose, the percentages of participants in B7471012 (3-dose 
series) with any local reaction (59.8% and 57.0% in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively) were 
higher than in the pooled trials using a 4-dose schedule (43.2% and 45.0% in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups, respectively).
These are between-population comparisons and should be interpreted with caution.
For participants ≥15 to <24 months of age enrolled in B7471014 Cohort 1, most local reactions were mild 
or moderate in severity after the single dose of 20vPnC. Pain at the injection site, redness, and swelling 
were reported in 52.5%, 37.7% and 22.1% of participants, respectively. The frequencies of local 
reactions after 20vPnC in this toddler population were similar to those after the toddler dose in B7471012 
(3-dose series) and slightly higher than after (toddler) Dose 4 in the pooled 4-dose trials. These are 
between-population comparisons and should be interpreted with caution.
Across all doses, the median onset day for local reactions in participants after 20vPnC was Day 1 or Day 2 
(Day 1 was the day of vaccination), and reactions resolved with a median duration of 1 to 3 days.

Table 61. Local Reactions, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose – B7471012, 
B7471003, B7471011, and B7471013 – Safety Population
Local Reactions in Children ≥2 to <18 Years of Age
The percentages of participants in B7471014 with any local reaction (redness, swelling, and pain at the 
injection site) were 70.2%, 86.4%, and 83.9% in children ≥2 to <5 years, ≥5 to <10 years, and ≥10 to 
<18 years of age (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4), respectively. Most local reactions were mild or moderate. Severe 
local reactions were reported infrequently at ≤2% for all local reactions.
Across all age groups, the most commonly reported local reaction was pain at the injection site (66.0%–
82.9% of participants), followed by redness (15.1%–39.1%), and swelling (15.6%–27.1%). The rate of 
pain at the injection site generally increased with age, while rates of redness and swelling were lowest in 
the oldest age cohort.
Local reactions had a median onset day of Day 1 or Day 2 (Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and a 
median duration of 1 or 2 days in children ≥2 to <18 years of age.
Systemic Events in Infants and Toddlers
For all doses, the median onset day for systemic events in infants and toddlers was Day 1 or Day 2, and 
events generally resolved with a median duration of 1 to 3 days.
With both schedules, most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe events were 
reported infrequently: 0.0% to 2.2% for all events, except for severe irritability, which was reported at 
slightly higher frequencies (2.1%–8.6%) that generally decreased with subsequent doses.
In B7471012 (3-dose schedule), the percentages of participants with systemic events (fever, decreased 
appetite, drowsiness, and irritability) within 7 days after each of the 3 doses of 20vPnC were generally 
similar to those after the corresponding dose of 13vPnC, with no clinically important differences between 
the vaccine groups. Between-group (20vPnC – 13vPnC) differences ranged from -2.6% to 5.3%.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/20244
Page 155/198
Percentages of participants with systemic events were also generally similar after either 20vPnC or 
13vPnC in the pooled infant population administered a 4-dose series. Between group differences (20vPnC 
– 13vPnC) ranged from -1.7% to 2.2%.
With a 3-dose series, the most frequently reported systemic events were irritability (71.0%-71.9% in the 
20vPnC group; 68.4%–72.5% in the 13vPnC group) and drowsiness (50.9%–61.2% in the 20vPnC group; 
48.6%–63.7% in the 13vPnC group). Decreased appetite was reported at lower frequencies (24.7%–
39.3% in the 20vPnC group; 19.4%-36.5% in the 13vPnC group). Fever of ≥38.0°C (i.e,“any” fever) 
occurred in 8.9% to 24.3% of participants after 20vPnC; and 8.5% to 23.7% after 13vPnC after each 
dose; frequencies were lowest after Dose 1. Fever of >40.0°C was reported for 2 (0.3%) participants 
after the toddler dose only.
Similarly, in the pooled population (4-dose series), the most frequently reported systemic events were 
irritability (58.5%–70.6% in the 20vPnC group; 59.4%–71.5% in the 13vPnC group) and drowsiness 
(37.7%–66.2% in the 20vPnC group; 38.1%–65.6% in the 13vPnC group). Decreased appetite was 
reported at lower frequencies (23.0%–26.4% in the 20vPnC group; 22.3%–25.9% in the 13vPnC group). 
Fever of ≥38.0°C (ie, “any” fever) occurred in dose. Fever of >40.0°C was reported for 0 to 3 (0.2%) 
participants after any dose.
In B7471012 (3-dose series), the frequencies for fever of ≥38.0°C and decreased appetite were higher 
after the toddler dose than after the 2 infant doses. Drowsiness was more frequently reported after Dose 
1. In the pooled infant population (4-dose series), the frequencies of irritability and drowsiness decreased 
slightly after subsequent doses. 
Upon examining the frequencies obtained for each dosing schedule, the percentages of participants in 
B7471012 (3-dose series) with any systemic event after the toddler dose (83.1% and 81.4% in the 
20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively) were higher than in the pooled population (4-dose schedule) 
(68.5% and 70.5% in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively). Use of antipyretic or pain 
medication was more frequent after the toddler dose among the B7471012 participants (3-dose series) 
compared with after the toddler dose of the 4-dose series and more frequent after the infant doses 
among the pooled population (4-dose series) compared with after the infant doses of the 3-dose series. 
These are between-population comparisons and should be interpreted with caution.
For participants ≥15 to <24 months of age with 3 prior doses of 13vPnC enrolled in B7471014 Cohort 1, 
the most frequently reported systemic event was irritability (61.8%), followed by drowsiness/increased 
sleep (41.7%), and decreased appetite (25.0%). Fever was reported in 11.8% of participants, and fever 
>38.9°C was uncommon (2.9%) with no reported fever >40°C. The frequencies of systemic events after 
20vPnC in this toddler population were lower than those after the toddler dose in B7471012 (3-dose 
series) and similar to those after (toddler) Dose 4 in the pooled 4-dose trials. These are between-
population comparisons and should be interpreted with caution.

B7471003, B7471011, and B7471013 – Safety Population
Systemic Events in Children ≥2 to <18 Years of Age
The percentages of participants in B7471014 with any systemic event (fever, fatigue, headache, muscle 
pain, or joint pain in participants ≥2 to <18 years of age (Cohorts 2–4) were 50.2%, 58.3%, and 68.3% 
in children ≥2 to <5 years, ≥5 to <10 years, and ≥10 to <18 years of age (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4), 
respectively. Most systemic events were mild or moderate. Severe systemic events were reported 
infrequently at ≤1.5% for all systemic events.
For participants ≥2 to <18 years of age (Cohorts 2–4), muscle pain (26.5%–48.3%) and fatigue (27.8%–
37.2%) were most frequently reported, followed by headache (5.6%–29.3%) and joint pain (3.7%–
8.3%) (Module 5.3.5.2 B7471014 Report Body Table 15). The reported rates of headache and muscle 
pain increased with age, while fatigue was somewhat more common in children ≥2 to <5 years. Fever 
was uncommon in children 2 to <18 years of age, with 3.3% of children ≥2 to <5 years reporting any 
fever, and 1 participant >5 years of age reporting fever.
The median onset day for systemic events in children ≥2 to <18 years of age was Day 1 or Day 2, and 
events resolved with a median duration of 1 or 2 days.

Adverse Events in Infants and Toddlers
The AEs reported in B7471012 (3-dose series) generally reflected diseases and conditions often observed 
in the infant population. The percentages of participants with any AEs were similar among 20vPnC and 
13vPnC recipients from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 (13.8% in the 20vPnC group and 14.4% in the 
13vPnC group) and from the toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose (15.5% in the 20vPnC group 
and 16.5% in the 13vPnC group).
The AEs reported in the larger pools of infant and toddler participants also generally reflected diseases 
and conditions often observed in the infant and toddler population. From Dose 1 to 1 month after the last 
study-specified infant dose (for the pool of infants from B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, and 
B7471013), AEs were reported in 31.3% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 32.1% in the 13vPnC 
group. 
From the study-specified toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose (for the pool of participants 
enrolled at <2 years of age from B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, B7471013, and B7471014 Cohort 1), 
AEs were reported in 16.1% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 16.7% in the 13vPnC group.
AEs with a pooled event rate of ≥1% in at least 1 (pooled) vaccine group (Tier 2 AEs) were comparable 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC recipients. Between-group differences in the percentages of participants 
reporting Tier 2 AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after the last study specified infant dose were low (-0.2% to 
0.5%).
The between-group differences from the study-specified toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose 
were also low (-0.9% to 0.7%). The most frequently reported Tier 2 AEs were common paediatric 
infections or conditions: upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis in both groups.
Tier 2 AEs during the whole study duration: Tier 2 AEs (AE preferred terms reported by ≥1% of 
participants in at least one vaccine group) and between-group differences are provided for the 3-dose 
regimen trial in Table 2 and the pooled 4-dose regimen trials in Table 3. The percentages of participants 
with Tier-2 AEs were low and comparable in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, both in the 3-dose regimen 
trial and in the pooled 4-dose regimen trials, with between-group differences (20vPnC – 13vPnC) between  
2.4% and 1.5% in the 3-dose regimen trial and between -0.5% and 0.7% in the pooled 4-dose regimen 
trials. All 95% CIs for the percentage differences of Tier 2 events crossed 0% except for 2 events (out of 
35 Tier 2 events by preferred term): conjunctivitis in the 3-dose regimen trial (lower 95% CI of 0.1) and 
fall in the 4-dose regimen trials (lower 95% CI of 0.0). Based on the number of comparisons, the minor 
difference, and nature of the events (conjunctivitis and fall, which don’t have a plausible pathophysiologic 
link to vaccination), the differences are considered to be due to chance.
Adverse Events in Children ≥2 to <18 Years of Age
The AEs reported in children ≥2 to <18 years of age generally reflected diseases and conditions often 
observed in the paediatric population. The percentages of participants with AEs within 1 month of 20vPnC 
in B7471014 decreased with increasing age: 7.9% of participants ≥2 to <5 years (Cohort 2), 6.5% of 
participants ≥5 to <10 years (Cohort 3), and 4.4% of participants ≥10 to <18 years of age (Cohort 4).

AEs during the whole study duration
The AEs reported during the entire study duration for the 3-dose regimen and the 4-dose regimen trials 
were provided with the responses. The AEs reported were generally consistent with diseases and 
conditions commonly observed in infants. The percentage of participants with AEs in the 3-dose regimen 
trial was similar in the 20vPnC (27.6%) and 13vPnC (28.5%) groups. For the pooled analysis across the 
4-dose regimen trials, the percentage of participants with AEs was also similar in the 20vPnC (42.5%) 
and 13vPnC (44.8%) groups. The most frequently reported AEs belonged to the system organ class 
(SOC) of infections and infestations and were similar in the 20vPnC (20.3% and 30.2%) and 13vPnC 
(21.2% and 30.6%) groups in the 3-dose regimen trial and the 4-dose regimen trials, respectively. AEs 
belonging to the SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders 
were also reported. The relative frequency of the events among the SOCs were similar between the 
regimens.
Related Adverse events
In B7471012 (3-dose series), the number and percentages of participants with AEs from Dose 1 to 1 
month after Dose 2 that were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention were generally 
similar for 20vPnC and 13vPnC recipients (2 [0.3%] and 4 [0.7%], respectively) (Module 5.3.5.1 
B7471012 Report Body Table 21). From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 1 related AE was reported in 
each vaccine group: dermatitis allergic (20vPnC) and injection site nodule (13vPnC) (Module 5.3.5.1 
B7471012 Report Body Table 22). One SAE, inflammation in B7471012, considered by the investigator to 
be potentially related to study vaccine (or concomitant vaccine), is described in Section 2.7.4.2.4.
The percentages of pooled participants with AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to 
study intervention were also similar among 20vPnC and 13vPnC recipients from Dose 1 to 1 month after 
the last study-specified infant dose in B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, and B7471013 (0.6% and 0.8%, 
respectively) and from the study-specified toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose in B7471003, 
B7471011, B7471012, B7471013, and B7471014 Cohort 1 (0.2% and 0.3%).
The most frequently reported related AEs were injection site erythema (four 20vPnC and three 13vPnC) 
and diarrhoea (three 20vPnC and two 13vPnC) reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after the last study-
specified infant dose. The other less frequently reported AEs (1-2 events/term) were considered related 
as they are reported as ADRs following Prevenar 13 administration, or in other cases based on temporal 
association alone, with limited physiologic plausibility.
In older subjects, only 1 participant had a related AE within 1 month after 20vPnC: 1 participant ≥5 to 
<10 years of age (0.5%; Cohort 3). The AE was for upper abdominal pain of mild severity that began on 
Day 12, lasted for 12 days, and was considered related based on temporal association.

AEs during the whole study duration
The percentages of participants with related AEs were low and similar between the 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
groups. Related AEs were reported in 0.5% and 0.9% (20vPnC) and 0.8% and 1.2% (13vPnC) of 
participants in the 3-dose regimen trial and the pooled 4-dose regimen trials, respectively. The most 
frequently reported related AEs were injection site reactions in the SOC of general disorders and

administration site conditions. These generally reflected adverse reactions already listed for 13vPnC or 
isolated events.
Severe Adverse Events 
In B7471012, severe AEs were reported infrequently from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 (for ≤0.7% of 
participants) and from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 (for ≤0.9% of participants) (Module 5.3.5.1 
B7471012 Supplemental Tables 14.43 and 14.44, respectively), and the percentages were similar in the 
20vPnC and 13vPnC groups. 
The percentages of pooled participants with severe AEs were also similar for 20vPnC and 13vPnC 
recipients from Dose 1 to 1 month after the last study-specified infant dose in B7471003, B7471011, 
B7471012, and B7471013 (0.8% and 0.7%, respectively; Module 5.3.5.3 ISS Table 8) and from the 
study-specified toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose in B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, 
B7471013, and B7471014 Cohort 1 (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively; Module 5.3.5.3 ISS Table 9). Most 
severe AEs were in the Infections and infestations SOC.
One participant ≥5 to <10 years of age (Cohort 3) had a severe AE of urticaria on Day 12 after 20vPnC 
which lasted for 13 days and was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.

AEs during the whole study duration
The percentages of participants with severe AEs were low and similar and reported in 2.5% and 2.0% of 
participants in the 20vPnC groups and 1.3% and 1.7% in the 13vPnC groups in the 3 dose regimen trial 
and the pooled 4-dose regimen trials, respectively. These were generally single events, and most 
frequently reported in the SOC of infections and infestations. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
There were no deaths in any of the trials.
Serious Adverse Events
The percentages of participants with SAEs in B7471012 were similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC control 
groups (5.7% and 6.6%, respectively).
The percentages of participants across all paediatric trials with SAEs from Dose 1 to the end of the trials 
were low (3.8% for 20vPnC recipients and 4.5% for 13vPnC recipients); ≤0.4% experienced a specific 
SAE.
Over the whole study duration, SAEs were reported at a rate of 5.7% and 3.4% in the 20vPnC groups, 
and 6.6% and 3.0% in the 13vPnC groups in the 3-dose regimen trial and the 4-dose regimen trials, 
respectively. As with the severe AEs, the most frequently reported SAEs were in the SOC of infections and 
infestations.
SAEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after the last study-specified infant dose and from the study-specified 
toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose were low and similar for 20vPnC (1.4% and 0.6%, 
respectively) and 13vPnC (1.5 % and 0.7%, respectively) recipients. SAEs included infections requiring 
hospitalization that may be expected to occur at a low background level in infants. During the 2-year 
study period for B7471011 and B7471013, rates of respiratory infections, particularly bronchiolitis 
occurred at a relatively high frequency and that is reflected in the SAEs. Participants with SAEs of failure 
to thrive (2 20vPnC recipients and 1 13vPnC recipient), cerebral haemorrhage (2 20vPnC recipients), and 
infantile spasm (1 20vPnC recipient) withdrew from their respective trials. 
There was one SAE in B7471012 considered potentially related to study vaccine (or concomitant vaccine) 
by the investigator. A participant in the 20vPnC group was reported to have an SAE of inflammation with 
an onset date 7 days after Dose 1 and duration of 10 days. This participant was hospitalized with fever 
and laboratory tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and procalcitonin). There was an area 
of painful swelling in the right groin, and a right inguinal hernia was diagnosed. A blood culture was 
negative, and no specific disease diagnosis was made. The participant received antibiotics in the hospital, 
and the event resolved. The investigator considered the event potentially related to study vaccine or 
Infanrix hexa. Pfizer did not concur as the inflammation was more likely related to the concomitant 
vaccine, Infanrix hexa, which was given in the right leg, the same side as the painful swelling. The 
concurrent inguinal hernia complicated by inflammation/infection was also considered to be a possible 
contributing factor. This participant was not withdrawn from the study and received Dose 2 and Dose 3 of 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 167/198
20vPnC with no repeat of the event, which also made the relationship to study intervention less likely. 
Besides this event, there were no other SAEs assessed as related to vaccine in any other trial.
In B7471011 there was 1 participant in the 20vPnC group with an SAE of immune thrombocytopenia on 
Day 141 after Dose 3, which lasted for 36 days. Another participant in the 20vPnC group had an SAE of 
Kawasaki’s disease on Day 103 after Dose 3; the event was recovering/resolving when the participant 
was withdrawn from the trial due to receipt of immunoglobins which was prohibited by the protocol.
In B7471013 there were 2 participants in the 20vPnC group with SAEs of anaphylaxis and urticaria that 
warrant additional description; 1 participant had an anaphylactic reaction from food allergy 40 days after 
Dose 4 that resolved in 5 days, and the other participant developed urticaria 10 days after Dose 4 that 
resolved in 5 days. Neither were considered by the investigator to be related to study intervention.
The numbers and percentages of participants ≥15 months of age with SAEs were low: (2 participants 
[1.0%] ≥15 to <24 months of age [Cohort 1] and 3 participants [1.5%] ≥10 to <18 years of age [Cohort 
4]). All SAEs were reported in the interval 1 to 6 months after vaccination, except a near drowning SAE in 
Cohort 1, that was reported within 1 month after vaccination.

Other Significant Adverse Events
Seizures
Seizures or possible seizures were identified during the trials and then extracted from the database using 
MedDRA PTs (higher-level, lower-level, and dictionary terms), including, but not limited to convulsions, 
partial seizures, and epilepsy, etc. The percentages of participants across all paediatric trials who 
experienced seizures were low (14 [0.4%] for 20vPnC recipients and 11 [0.5%] for 13vPnC recipients). 
No seizures were considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccine.
Eight (0.2%) 20vPnC recipients and 3 (0.1%) 13vPnC recipients experienced a febrile convulsion. One 
infant participant in the 20vPnC group of B7471011 had a febrile convulsion on Day 7 after Dose 4, which 
was due to COVID-19 infection and unrelated to study intervention. The other febrile convulsions 
occurred between Days 14 and 252 after vaccination, including 1 febrile convulsion reported for a 
participant ≥15 to <24 months of age in B7471014.
Some atypical events such as partial seizure and seizure-like phenomena were experienced by 
participants in the infant trials. No event occurred within 4 days after vaccination. A listing of participants 
who experienced seizures during the trials was provided. No seizure was reported for any participant ≥2 
years of age.
Seizures reported for infants by timeframe (Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, 1 month after Dose 3 to 
before Dose 4, Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4, and 1 6 months after Dose 4) for B7471003, B7471011, 
B7471012 and B7471013 are presented in Table 62. Based on these analyses, seizures were reported at 
similar frequencies in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups in any study period. There was no trend in 
frequency of seizure occurrences based on trial phase.

Analysis Interval – B7471003, B7471011, B7471012, and B7471013 – Safety Population
Seizures were evaluated as other significant event. Respective events were summarized with acceptable 
methods. Overall, less than 0.5% of participants reported seizure or seizure-like events in all studies. This 
is comparable over all studies and between groups that received 20vPnC or 13vPnC. No concerns are 
raised. Seizures are appropriately reflected in the SmPC.
Laboratory findings
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not performed systematically in any of the trials. Any clinical 
laboratory values of concern that came to the attention of the investigator were to be reported as AEs.
Body temperature was measured at clinic visits before vaccination in order to ensure that the infant did 
not have a fever, which would have required the vaccination to be postponed. These data were not 
summarized.
No other safety evaluations were performed systematically. Any signs or symptoms of concern related to 
vital signs, physical examinations, or other evaluations that came to the attention of the investigator 
were to be reported as AEs, SAEs, or NDCMCs if they occurred within the protocol-specified time frames 
for collection of safety information.
Safety in special populations
Pregnancies
There were no pregnancies reported in B7471014, the only trial that enrolled females of childbearing 
potential.

Late Preterm Infants (B7471013)
The safety and tolerability of 20vPnC administered with a 4-dose schedule at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 
months of age to late preterm infants (infants born at ≥34 to <37 weeks gestational age [late preterm] 
in B7471013) were similar to those in term infants administered 20vPnC and 13vPnC with the same 
schedule.
The local reactions and systemic events after Dose 1 to Dose 4 of 20vPnC and 13vPnC observed in late 
preterm infants were similar to those in term. The frequency of any reported local reaction (31.7% to 
55.3% in the Prevenar 20 group and 37.9% to 47.1% in the Prevenar 13 group) and systemic event 
(65.0% to 85.5% in the Prevenar 20 group and 59.4% to 77.4% in the Prevenar 13 group).
The frequency of AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 (31.2% after 20vPnC and 23.5% 
after 13vPnC) or from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 (14.3% after 20vPnC and 17.2% after 13vPnC) in 
late preterm infants was similar to that in term infants in B7471013.
Others
Subgroup analyses for local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were performed by sex in B7471012; by 
sex and race in B7471011 and B7471014; and by sex, race, and geographic region in B7471013. The 
results of these analyses are presented within the individual reports.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
In the infant trials, 20vPnC and 13vPnC were co-administered with the following vaccine antigens: 
diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Hib, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, hepatitis B, MMR, and 
varicella.
Additionally, ≥55% of participants in B7471012 and ≥85% of participants in B7471003, B7471013, and 
B7471011, respectively, received concomitant rotavirus vaccine together with Dose 1 or Dose 2 of 
20vPnC. Approximately 21% and 0.5%, 6% and 15%, and 12% and 10% of participants in the 20vPnC 
group received concomitant influenza vaccine with either Dose 3 or Dose 4, in the 3 trials, B7471003, 
B7471013, and B7471011, respectively. Approximately 44% (B7471013) and 5.5% (B7471011) of 
participants received hepatitis A vaccine with Dose 4 of 20vPnC.
In each age cohort of B7471014, between 0.5% (≥5 to <10 years; Cohort 3) and 13% (≥15 to <24 
months; Cohort 1) of participants received a specific non-study vaccine on the same day they received 
20vPnC. These non-study vaccines included Pentacel (DTaP, Hib, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine; 
Cohort 1 only); hepatitis A vaccines; influenza vaccines; DTaP (Cohort 1 only); and PedvaxHIB (Hib; 
Cohort 1 only).
In B7471011, local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were analyzed for participants with and without 
influenza vaccination. The safety profile was generally similar between participants vaccinated with 
20vPnC and 13vPnC with and without influenza vaccination.
Rates of antipyretics/pain medication given to treat symptoms in study participants during the 7 days 
after study vaccination were generally similar between 20vPnC and 13vPnC control groups and therefore 
no disproportionate influence was expected to be exerted on the results in one group. The protocol 
provided instructions that prophylactic antipyretics/pain medication (ie, in the absence of symptoms) was 
to be discouraged.

Post marketing experience
20vPnC has not been marketed for infants or children in any country. Therefore, no relevant paediatric 
post-marketing data are available.
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
Safety database
The safety of Prevenar 20 in the paediatric population is investigated in a total of 5 studies. The 
presented studies applied different dosing regimen and were performed in different age groups, however 
mainly focussing on infants, the main target group. In this age group a 2- or a 3-dose primary series 
followed by a toddler dose (also referred to as 3-dose or 4-dose regimen) were evaluated (3-dose 
regimen: B7471012; 4-dose regimen: B7471011, B7471013, B7471003). Based on the similarity on 
study design, population and dosing regimen the results for the 4-dose regimen are presented as pooled 
analysis. In general, the applied methods for data collection and analysis are considered appropriate. In 
older subjects (15 months – 18 years, who previously received at least 3 doses of 13vPnC) only one 
single dose was applied (study B7471014). In all infant trials 13vPnC was used as comparator vaccine, 
which is acceptable and in line with the immuno-bridging approach. Further, routine concomitant 
paediatric vaccines were additionally administered in all infant studies, which is considered informative. 
No post-marketing data is available for 20vPnC since it has not been marketed for infants or children in 
any country.
The presented safety population is considered representative for the main target population (healthy 
infants approximately 2 months of age). The demographic characteristics are comparable between infant 
trials and between vaccination groups. 
In total, 3664 participants were exposed to Prevenar 20 and 2323 received the control vaccine 13vPnC.  
In the infant studies, 2833 subjects received at least one dose of 20vPnC. In addition, supportive data for 
831 subjects (15 months to 18 years) receiving only one dose of Prevenar 20 are available. This 
supportive dataset is considered rather limited hampering conclusions for more specific age groups in this 
broad age range from 15 months to 18 years. Nevertheless, the size of the safety database is considered 
sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of Prevenar 20 but it is not considered sufficient to 
evaluate less common adverse events.  
Discontinuations
Overall, the percentage of subjects that withdrew due to adverse events of physician decision is low but 
some discrepancies in the reporting have been identified. The Applicant reported in total 12 subjects (9 
infants who received 20vPnC and 3 infants who received 13vPnC) but the numbers in the individual study 
reports differ (7 for 20vPnV and 4 for 13vPnC). The Applicant clarified upon request that this is due to 
different time points for reporting for the pooled dataset and the reporting dates in the study reports. The 
Applicant provided a detailed explanation which subjects were discontinued and how the discrepancy 
occurred, and the issue was resolved. Taking either report into consideration, it seems that slightly more 
subjects discontinued due to AEs in the 20vPnV group compared to 13vPnC. Nevertheless, the numbers 
are generally low, and no concerns are raised in this regard. Most of the reported AEs were seizure-like 
events. According to the Applicant, participants with seizures/seizure-associated conditions were often 
withdrawn due to questions of continued eligibility, therewith underestimating the withdrawal due to AEs. 
The Applicant provided more detailed listing of seizure(-like) events and discontinuations related to such 
events and related conditions. Since the number of discontinuations of subjects with respective conditions 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 174/198
are similar between arms and the provided reasoning for discontinuation seems acceptable, the risk of 
underestimation of a general risk of seizure (-like) events is considered low. 
Reporting of Adverse events
Immediate reaction occurring in the first 30 minutes, local reactions and systemic events occurring in the 
first seven days are presented separately, which is considered appropriate. 
Overall, AEs were reported until one month after the last dose. However, reporting of SAEs and newly 
diagnosed chronic medical condition differed between studies. While in study B7471011 subjects were 
followed up 6 months after the last vaccination, the follow up in the 3-dose regimen study B7471012 was 
only 1 month. Since this is the only study evaluating the 3-dose regimen, the shorter follow up required 
justification. Although it was agreed in a Scientific Advice procedure, it was also stated that this would 
only be acceptable if the safety data from study B7471011 was reassuring. Upon request the Applicant 
provided an overview of AEs that were reported after 1 month after the last dose in the 4-dose regimen 
studies. No safety concerns were identified, consequently the shorter follow up time is acceptable.
Laboratory findings
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not performed systematically in any of the trials, which is acceptable. 
Fever was reported separately under systemic events.
Results
Immediate adverse events
Overall, immediate adverse events occurred infrequent (less than 1% of participants) with no apparent 
difference between doses. A slight difference between studies has been observed. The percentage of 
subjects with immediate events is slightly higher in the study evaluating the 3-dose regimen (~ 0.7%) 
compared to the pooled population (~0.2%). This slight difference could however also be due to the 
different group sizes. No concerns are raised in this respect.
In general, the percentage of participants with immediate AEs was comparable between 20vPnC and 
13vPnC in all studies and the pooled analysis set.
The most common immediate adverse events were administration site conditions, e.g., injection site 
swelling, erythema pain and hypersensitivity.
Local reactions and systemic events occurring within 7 days after vaccination
The Applicant presented an analysis of local reactions and systemic events that occurred within the first 7 
days after each vaccination including their severity. These AEs include redness, swelling and pain at the 
injection site as local reactions and fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness and irritability as systemic 
events. 
Local reactions were observed in 15-45% of subjects (for details please refer to the effects table). Fever 
was reported in 8-24% of subjects. The other systemic events were more frequent: Irritability (~60-
70%), Drowsiness (~40-66%) and decreased appetite (~20-40%).
In general, the reported events are mainly mild to moderate and resolved within 1-3 days. 
The frequencies and severities are comparable between subjects that received 20vPnC and 13vPnC. 
Further, frequencies are rather constant for each dose throughout the regimen. Some differences were, 
however, noted between dosing regimen, especially regarding the toddler dose. 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 175/198
While the frequencies are constant for the 4-dose regimen, the frequencies reported for the toddler dose 
with the 3-dose regimen are higher compared to the infant doses. Overall, higher frequencies (difference 
8-14%) with the 3-dose regimen were observed compared to the 4-dose regimen for all categories for 
the toddler dose. While for the other doses slightly higher frequencies were observed for some categories 
(e.g. redness and swelling events), the differences are not as pronounced as for the toddler dose. 
The same pattern was also observed in the 13vPnC group and no concerns are raised regarding the 
reported events in general. Nevertheless, the differences between regimen regarding the toddler dose 
required further discussion. While some differences might be attributed to differences in group sizes 
(study B7471012 vs pooled data), the obvious trend requires further discussion. The Applicant claims that 
the observed differences between studies might be due to several factors introducing variability including 
concomitant vaccination and region/country specific perception of the reported AEs. Further, the Applicant 
claims that the observed difference regarding the toddler dose might be due to the concomitant 
vaccination with Infanrix hexa (DTaP combination vaccine), with the toddler dose of 20vPnC or 13vPnC in 
this study. While the later argument can be followed, the assumed differences in study population would 
have potentially also affected one of the other 3+1 regimen studies. Given the presented data and the 
Applicants arguments, it cannot be excluded that a slight difference exists between both vaccination 
regimen. The Applicant further argued that in the respective studies similar rates have been observed 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC. While it is reassuring that this is not a 20vPnC specific effect, the observed 
difference between regimen is still maintained as uncertainty for this procedure. 
Local reactions and systemic events were also evaluated in older children (>2 years). No comparator 
vaccine was applied in this study, therefore no comparisons to other vaccines can be made.
The reported rates for redness and swelling are comparable to the infant studies. Pain at the injection site 
was however reported by a much higher percentage compared to the infant studies (52-80% vs 22-
42%). This may be explained by the age of the subjects as children can more directly communicate pain 
at the injections site than infants. Severity, onset of events and severity is comparable to the infant 
studies.
For children (2-18 years) evaluated systemic events included: fever, headache, fatigue and muscle or 
joint pain. The most frequently reported events are muscle pain (26.5%–48.3%) and fatigue (27.8%–
37.2%), followed by headache (5.6%–29.3%) and joint pain (3.7%–8.3%) Fever occurred mainly in 
younger children (3.3%) and only one report in the older cohorts. While the reported rates for fatigue and 
joint pain seem to rather constant with age. The rates for headache and muscle pain increase with age.
Other Adverse events 
The most common AEs are Infections and infestations (Conjunctivitis, Nasopharyngitis, Upper respiratory 
tract infection, Otitis media), pyrexia, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (Dermatitis atopic, 
Eczema) and Gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is in line with common conditions and diseases in the 
studied age group. Overall, the reported AEs are similar between groups that received 20vPnc or 13vPnC. 
No concerns are raised based on the currently presented data, however some additional analyses were 
requested.
In the presented reports the analysis of AEs is split between primary vaccination series and toddler dose. 
While this presentation is in principle appreciated to assess potential differences between primary series 
and toddler dose, but the chosen presentation does not allow for a valid comparison between doses as all 
data from all 2 or 3 infant doses are combined. This does not allow for a quantitative comparison between 
infant doses and toddler dose. However, no qualitative differences were observed, and no concerns are 
raised regarding potential differences of AEs between infant and toddler doses. 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 176/198
The Applicant further presented so called Tier 2 AEs, which are defined as AEs with a pooled event rate of 
≥1% in at least 1 (pooled) vaccine group, together with the estimated difference between vaccination 
groups (20vPnC and 13vPnC). Although this analysis is appreciated, the analyses are again performed for 
the infant series and the toddler dose data separately. No analysis for the pooled dataset for any is 
presented.
For the general representation of AEs and a suitable calculation of incidences regarding the vaccine a 
pooled analysis of all subjects in the multiple dose studies for all doses/the whole study duration was 
requested together with an updated representation of tier 2 events, related and severe events, which was 
provided by the Applicant as requested. The provided data are overall in line with the previously 
presented data and no new concerns arose. 
Study B7471014 evaluated a single dose in children starting from 15 months of age up to <18 years of 
age. The safety data is presented in four age groups (≥15 to <24 Months; ≥2 to <5 Years; ≥5 to <10 
Years; ≥10 to <18 Years). Overall reported AEs seem to decrease with age. While in the youngest age 
group 24% of subjects report AEs, only 4.4-7.9% report AEs in the older three subgroups. In general, the 
reported AEs are in line with conditions and diseases expected for these age groups. No concerns are 
raised.
It is noted that in the SmPC AEs are listed by age group, which is in principle appreciated but the 
presented age groups are: “6 weeks to less than 5 year of age” and “5 to less than 18 years of age”. No 
analysis for these age groups had been initially provided. The Applicant specified that for the age group 
“6 weeks to <5 years of age” data from B7471012 trial, the combined 4-dose trials, participants 15 to 
<24 months of age and 2 to <5 years of age from the B7471014 trial were examined and the highest 
frequency category was chosen to be presented in the SmPC. For the “5 to <18 years of age“ group data 
from study B74741014 for subjects 5 to <10 years of age and 10 to <18 years of age were considered. 
Further the rates for each frequency category in the SmPC have been presented. This approach is 
acceptable.
Related Adverse events
Vaccine-related AEs, that were not reported as immediate events or events occurring in 7 days after each 
dose were reported in less than 1% of subjects in both vaccine arms and for all doses. The most common 
related AEs were injection site related events and diarrhoea. The results are generally similar for both 
vaccines.
Related events have been appropriately included in the SmPC. 
Severe Adverse Events 
Severe adverse events were generally observed in less than 1% of subjects and most reported preferred 
terms for severe events occurred only in one subject. Most severe events were Infections and 
infestations. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
No deaths were reported during the paediatric development programme. 
SAE occurred in less 5% of all subjects in the infant trials. The results between 20vPnC and 13vPnC are 
comparable.  No trends between doses, age groups have been observed. In study B7471012 evaluating 
the 3-dose regimen, a slightly higher percentage of subjects reported SAEs (5.8%) but this was also 
comparable to the 13vPnC group in the study (6.6%). No concerns are raised.  
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 177/198
The most common SAEs are related to infections (Bronchiolitis, Gastroenteritis, Urinary tract infection, 
Pneumonia, Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and seizures 
(Febrile convulsion). The latter are further discussed below as other significant adverse event.
Only 1 SAE was considered related to study vaccine (inflammation requiring hospitalization). The 
Applicant detailed other events that were further investigated and considered not related. The presented 
respective reasoning can be followed for the presented cases. No concerns arose from the separately 
provided narratives.
In total 5 subjects withdraw due to SAEs in the 20vPnC vaccination groups (1 for 13vPnC). The Applicant 
reported that some instances of seizure-like events rendered the subject no longer eligible for the trial 
and they were excluded. The respective reason for withdrawal in consequently not listed as “due to AE”. 
The Applicant provided more detailed listing of seizure(-like) events and discontinuations related to such 
events and related conditions (for details please refer to the assessment of the responses). Since the 
number of discontinuations of subjects with respective conditions are similar between arms and the 
provided reasoning for discontinuation seems acceptable, the risk of underestimation of a general risk of 
seizure (-like) events is considered low. 
Seizures were evaluated as other significant event included several seizure-like and related events. 
Overall, less than 0.5% of participants reported such events in all studies. This is comparable over all 
studies and between groups that received 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Such events are appropriately reflected in 
the SmPC.
Special populations
Only one study included pre-term infants. The results show no apparent differences in the safety profile 
compared to full term infants. However, only 110 subjects (76 20vPnC, 34 13vPnC) were included as pre- 
term infants. Whether these subjects could be regarded as representative for pre-term infant in general 
required further clarification, since the included infants were born with ≥34 to <37 weeks gestational age 
and could therefore only be classified as late preterm infants. The Applicant reported the results of a 
previously performed study with 13vPnC, that has also been submitted for a Type II variation for 
Prevenar 13. The study showed that in general the safety profile in infants with lower gestational age was 
similar to later pre-term infants. The study concluded that after each dose of the infant series, infants 
born at an earlier GA (i.e., GA <29 weeks) generally experienced more tenderness, redness, and swelling 
at the injection site than did infants born at a later GA. But overall, the safety profile was comparable 
between gestational age subgroups. Based on the presented results it can be assumed that the data 
presented for preterm infants with 20vPnC are overall applicable to infants with lower GA. The Applicant 
will further discuss the use of 20vPnC in preterm infants in upcoming PSUSAs.
No data is available for immunocompromised paediatric patients or paediatric patients with other risk 
factors.  
No differences have been observed in subgroup analyses of local reactions, systemic events and other 
AEs based on sex, race and geographic region.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
In the infant trials, all subjects received routine infant vaccinations concomitantly with 20vPnC and 
13vPnC for the following: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Hib, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, 
hepatitis B, MMR, and varicella. Since no control group was included, no conclusions can be drawn 
regarding potential differences between concomitant and separate vaccinations. Nevertheless, the 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 178/198
observed safety profile between 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups are comparable and no safety signal was 
identified for any of these vaccinations.
Other vaccines have been administered in subgroups including rotavirus vaccine, influenza vaccine and 
hepatitis A vaccine. The Applicant initially proposed mention of rotavirus and influenza vaccines in the 
SmPC.  While the safety profile of 20vPnC in the respective studies does not raise safety concerns in 
general, a statement to that effect is currently not supported by the provided data due to lack of 
respective analyses. Only in study B7471011 (4-dose regimen) separate analyses for local reactions, 
systemic events and AEs were presented for the co-administration with influenza vaccine. These analyses 
showed overall comparable safety reports. Only about 10% more participants reported fever in the 
concomitant vaccination group, which was also reported in the group receiving 13vPnC concomitantly 
with influenza vaccine. No information was provided in the other studies or for participants that received 
rotavirus or hepatitis A vaccines.  The applicant was asked to provide safety analyses for the other 
studies, with regard to influenza, rotavirus and hepatitis A vaccines. It was clarified that in study 
B7471011, the rate of concomitant rotavirus administration with 20vPnC or Prevenar 13 were very high 
due to the rotavirus vaccination scheme recommended in the US (87.3% for Dose 1, 84.9% for Dose 2, 
and 65.8% for Dose 3 for 20vPnC). Consequently, no meaningful comparison between subjects with or 
without concomitant rotavirus vaccination can be drawn. But since most of the subjects received 
concomitant vaccinations with both vaccines, the safety profile established in study B7471011 can be 
regarded as representative for the concomitant vaccination and no major safety concerns were raised. 
Regarding study B7471012, since this was performed in several countries with different childhood 
vaccination recommendation, a comparison between concomitant and separate rotavirus vaccination was 
possible (47% received a concomitant rotavirus vaccine) and the data was presented. With respect to 
study B7471013, it was argued that no new information would result from such analyses. Overall, 
presented data for studies B7471011 and B7471012 and the overall safety data presented for study 
B7471013 do not indicate safety concerns. 
Since reduced titres have been observed in the adult population when 20vPnC was administered 
concomitantly with influenza vaccine, co-administration might also influence the protective potential of 
20vPnC in the paediatric population. The Applicant was therefore requested to present the 
immunogenicity data for the subgroups presented for the influenza vaccination in study B7471011. This 
was however not further pursued and hence, an SmPC statement for flu concomitant administration in 
the paediatric population is omitted.  
As regard to immunogenicity data made for the subgroups formed for the safety analysis regarding the 
rotavirus vaccination for study B7471012, data for the 2+1 schedule after the second dose shows 
reduced titres for both Prevenar 20 and Prevenar 13. Concomitant vaccination is seen critical with a 2+1 
schedule and in order to ensure protection, a third infant dose would be recommended.
In older paediatric subjects, non-study vaccines were concomitantly administered in small subgroups 
(Pentacel (DTaP, Hib, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine), hepatitis A vaccines; influenza vaccines, DTaP, 
and PedvaxHIB). The concomitantly vaccinated subgroups are however too small to draw valid 
conclusions. 
Rates of antipyretics/pain medication given to treat symptoms in study participants during the 7 days 
after study vaccination were generally similar between 20vPnC and 13vPnC control groups. Prophylactic 
antipyretics/pain medication was allowed but should be discouraged.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
20vPnC is overall well tolerated and the safety profile of 20vPnC is comparable to 13vPnC. Reactogenicity 
and other adverse events are mostly characterized as mild to moderate and the AE profile does not 
suggest any serious safety concerns.
However, higher rates of local and systemic events especially for the toddler dose have been observed for 
the 3-dose (2+1) regimen. Although this has also been observed with 13vPnC, this remains as 
uncertainty for the 2+1 regimen.
In the presented dossier, only limited safety datasets were presented for: Pre-term infants and children > 
2 years of age. While no major concerns are raised regarding these populations based on the presented 
safety data, uncertainties regarding these populations remain due to the limited available data. However, 
the Applicant provided supportive data from 13vPnC on the claim that the provided pre-term data is also 
representative for infants with lower gestational age, mitigating some of the raised concerns. In addition, 
the Applicant commits to discuss the use of 20vPnC in preterm infants in upcoming PSUSAs.
As discussed in the sections regarding the assessment of immunogenicity, overall lower immune response 
to 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC has been observed for the 13 shared serotypes. The clinical relevance of 
this reduction is currently not known but might affect the duration of a protection effect. Further, it is not 
known whether the obtained titres for the 7 additional serotypes indeed elicit a protective effect. 
Consequently, a potential lack of efficacy can currently not be excluded, and the Applicant is requested to 
perform post marketing surveillance and potential studies to confirm effectiveness of the vaccine. Please 
also refer to the discussion in the immunogenicity/efficacy section for further detail.
Regarding co-administration, the following statement in the SmPC for Prevenar 20 when used as a four 
(3+1) dose schedule can be supported:
“In infants and children, 6 weeks to less than 5 years of age, Prevenar 20 can be administered 
concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent or combination vaccines: 
diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated 
poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines. In clinical trials, rotavirus vaccines were 
permitted to be administered concomitantly with Prevenar 20 and no safety concerns were observed.” 
Recommendation [REC]
The Applicant will discuss the use of 20vPnC in preterm infants in upcoming PSUSAs.
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
2.6.  Risk management plan
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 3.0 with this application (at start of procedure). The 
variation proposes to extend the approved indication of 20vPnC to include infants, children, and 
adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, 
and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
The main proposed RMP changes were the following:

2.7.  Update of the Product information
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.
2.7.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Prevenar 20 (pneumococcal polysaccharide 
conjugate vaccine (20-valent, adsorbed)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is a biological 
product authorised after 1 January 2011.
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Prevenar 20 (20vPnC). The indication applied for is 
“active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of 
age.”
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Currently, three vaccines are licensed for this indication in children in the EU: Prevenar 13 (13vPnC), 
Vaxneuvance (15vPnC) and Synflorix (10vPnC, only for children up to 5 years of age). Prevenar 20 
(20vPnC) contains 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) included in the 
licensed Prevenar13, plus 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F), not included in 
Prevenar13 or Synflorix, 2 of which are included in Vaxneuvance (22F and 33F).
In 2019, the 7 additional serotypes covered by PCV20 caused 35% and 33% of IPD among children aged 
<1 and 1-4 years in Europe, respectively, or a total of 424 IPD cases, based on surveillance data from 30 
countries reporting to the ECDC. Five of these serotypes (serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F and 15B) are not 
covered by any licensed PCV and caused 25% and 24% of remaining IPD in children age <1 and 1-4 
years in Europe, respectively. 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 183/198
According to the ECDC, the most confirmed and reported cases of IPD in 2021 (the most recent data) was 
due to serotypes 3 (16.9%), 8 (14.4%) and 19A (10.6%). Serotypes 3 and 19A are contained in Prevenar 
13 vaccine, while the serotype 8 is not. 
According to the MAH, 20vPnC has been developed to replace 13vPnC. The Apexxnar trade name is 
replaced by Prevenar 20.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
No efficacy studies have been performed with 20vPnC; efficacy is inferred based on immunogenicity. 
Studies B7471012 and B7471011 are considered pivotal as they provide the main evidence for 
immunogenicity and safety in the target population. Both pivotal trials were phase 3, randomised, active-
controlled, double-blind, multicentre studies, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
20vPnC in healthy infants when administered as a series of 2 infant doses and 1 toddler dose (B7471012) 
or as a series of 3 infant doses and 1 toddler dose (B7471011). Both pivotal trials were designed to 
provide non-inferiority (NI) comparisons of the 20vPnC immune responses with those of 13vPnC, for 
which effectiveness has been demonstrated. 
In the 3-dose schedule vaccines were administered at roughly 2-3, 4-5, and 11-12 months of age, while 
in the 4-dose schedule vaccines were administered at roughly 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 
Immunogenicity was evaluated 1 month after the last infant dose and 1 month after the toddler dose. In 
the main studies, participants also received routine childhood vaccinations. The chosen population is 
considered sensitive for the intended immuno-bridging exercise.
3.2.  Favourable effects
20vPnC was immunogenic in all clinical studies in all subgroups.
B7471012 (3-dose series):
After the last infant dose (Dose 2), NI criterion for response rate was met for 4/13 shared serotypes and 
5/7 additional serotypes; and NI criterion for IgG GMR was met for 9/13 shared serotypes and for all 7 
additional serotypes. 
After the toddler dose (Dose 3), difference between treatments decreased; the NI criterion for IgG GMR 
was met for 12/13 shared serotypes and for all 7 additional serotypes. After the toddler dose, for the 
majority of shared serotypes, the IgG GMCs were well above the pre-defined cut-offs. Pneumococcal IgG 
GMCs for all 7 additional serotypes were much higher than the IgG GMCs from the corresponding 
serotypes in the 13vPnC group, demonstrating that Prevenar 20 elicits immune response to 7 additional 
serotypes. After the toddler dose NI was not formally tested for the response rate; however, the 
differences between vaccines were small for majority of shared serotypes. 
B7471011 (4-dose series):
After the last infant dose (Dose 3), NI criterion for response rate was met for 8/13 shared serotypes and 
for 6/7 additional serotypes; and NI criterion for IgG GMR was met for all shared and all additional 
serotypes (the latter was a key secondary endpoint). 
After the toddler dose (Dose 4), difference between treatments decreased; the NI criterion for IgG GMR 
was met for all shared and all additional serotypes. For most shared serotypes in both groups, the IgG 
GMCs were well above the pre-defined cut-offs. Same as in the 3-dose series, pneumococcal IgG GMCs 
for all 7 additional serotypes were much higher than the IgG GMCs from the corresponding serotypes in 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 184/198
the 13vPnC group. After toddler dose NI was not formally tested for the response rate; however, the 
differences between vaccines were small for the majority of shared serotypes. 
Furthermore, 20vPnC was able to elicit functional antibodies as measured by the OPA titres to all 20 
serotypes contained in the vaccine. 20vPnC was also able to induce immune memory. 
The immune response to the concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable between 20vPnC 
and 13vPnC group, indicating that 20vPnC can be administered concomitantly with vaccines against 
diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and Hib, commonly used in this age 
group, without having a negative impact on the protection against these diseases.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Assays. Two different assays (13-plex dLIA and 7-plex dLIA) were used to obtain antibody titres for the 
13 serotypes also contained in 13vPnC and the 7 additional serotypes, respectively. This design does not 
allow quantitative comparisons between the two sets of serotypes since the influence of specific serotype 
combinations on the dLIA measurement of serotype-specific IgG concentrations is unclear. Consequently, 
the current approach limits the interpretation of titres for the 7 additional serotypes in comparison to that 
of the 13 shared serotypes.
No efficacy/effectiveness data. No efficacy or effectiveness data is available for 20vPnC in infants and 
children. The application to extend the indication to infants and children is based on the inference of 
20vPnC efficacy for the prevention of vaccine serotype-specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration 
of non-inferior immune responses to 13vPnC, for which effectiveness has been demonstrated. 
Failed pivotal trials. Both pivotal trials failed to meet their primary objectives as non-inferiority was not 
met for each of the 20 serotypes for all co-primary endpoints. In B7471012 after the last infant dose, the 
NI criterion for the response rate was missed for 9/13 shared and 2/7 additional serotypes; and the NI 
criterion for the IgG GMR was missed for 4/13 shared serotypes. After the toddler dose in B7471012, the 
NI criterion for the response rate was missed for 1/13 shared serotypes (serotype 6B). In total, 15/60 
statistical tests failed in B7471012. In B7471011 after the last infant dose, the NI criterion was missed for 
5/13 shared and 1/7 additional serotypes for the response rate. In total, 6/40 statistical tests failed in 
B7471011. 
Unknown clinical relevance of NI margins (NIMs). The immunobridging approach based on non-
inferiority is generally acceptable. However, it should be noted that, while the NI margin of -10% for the 
difference (20vPnC minus 13vPnC) in response rate (percentage of participants achieving the predefined 
IgG antibody concentration) and NIM of 0.5 for the pneumococcal IgG GMR (20vPnC/13vPnC) have been 
previously used in clinical studies of approved pneumococcal vaccines, they have not been justified from 
a clinical perspective. Therefore, meeting or not meeting these NI criteria is of unknown clinical 
relevance.
No correlate of protection. There is no established correlate of protection for the additional 7 
serotypes. The clinical relevance of the obtained titres is currently unknown.
Further there is no correlate of protection known for pneumonia or AOM for any of the 20 serotypes. The 
indications of pneumonia and AOM were granted to 13vPnC based on non-inferiority of immune response 
to 7vPnC. 13vPnC has been shown to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated 
children has been observed. However, no exact vaccine efficacy was determined, nor the immune 
response required to achieve protection. Therefore, the strategy of non-inferiority testing for 20vPnC to 
13vPnC, especially when lower immune response is observed with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC, 
introduces the possibility that 20vPnC might not be effective against pneumonia and AOM. In addition, 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 185/198
whether the correlate of protection also applies for the 7 new serotypes included in 20vPnC, is currently 
unknown. 
NI comparison for additional serotypes. The approach for NI comparisons of the 7 additional 
serotypes against the lowest observed response among the vaccine serotypes in the 13vPnC group 
(excluding serotype 3) is considered rather uninformative and might even be potentially misleading. From 
the methodological perspective, this way of choosing the comparator threshold disregards the fact that 
IgG concentrations (/increases) for different serotypes follow different distributions (i.e., can be expected 
to differ in mean and variability). Consequently, the estimated values for the 20vPnC/13vPnC-ratios for 
GMC and percentage above predefined IgG-levels can get unreasonably high. Furthermore, given the 
tendency that lower mean response is associated with smaller variability in the raw concentration data, 
the width of the 95% CIs computed for the NI evaluation (for ratios) could become arbitrarily small. 
Consequently, NI testing setup for the 7 additional serotypes is not considered sufficiently informative, 
neither for the evaluation of IgG-response, nor for the potential implication for disease protection. 
Location and widths of the CIs as displayed in the corresponding figures of the CSR have a strong 
potential to mislead the interpretation of the actual response data for the 7 additional serotypes, with a 
clear systematic tendency for overestimation of the 20vPnC benefit.
Reduced immunogenicity response. Generally, the immune response to 20vPnC was numerically 
lower compared to 13vPnC as assessed by IgG GMC for all shared serotypes both after last infant dose 
and after toddler dose and by response rates for a majority of shared serotypes after last infant dose. 
Regarding IgG GMC, the ratio fell below 1 for all shared serotypes in both pivotal trials after last infant 
dose and after toddler dose. 
Persistence of assumed protective effect. Since the last available immunogenicity measurements 
were 1 moth post toddler dose, no long-term data are available.  The data indicate that IgG 
concentrations decline at a similar rate after vaccination with 20vPnC and 13vPnC and consequently also 
the response rates. Given that the initial concentrations were lower with 20vPnC, it could be expected 
that the assumed protective effect of 20vPnC might wane earlier compared to 13vPnC. 
Immune response in pre-term infants. No immunogenicity data is available for pre-terms infants. 
No data is available for infants and children at higher risk of pneumococcal disease. No studies 
have been conducted with 20vPnC in children who have underlying conditions predisposing them to 
invasive pneumococcal disease (such as sickle cell disease, HSCT or HIV infection). 
A single dose of 20vPnC in infants fully immunised with lower-valency PCV. 20vPnC elicited 
immediate serotype-specific immune response to all 7 additional serotypes, however it is unclear whether 
a single (priming) dose of 20vPnC is sufficient to achieve protection against the 7 extra serotypes and to 
induce robust immunological memory. 
Co-administration with other vaccines. No immunogenicity data has been provided for subjects that 
received concomitant vaccination of 20vPnC with influenza and hepatitis A vaccines. Data was presented 
for the pneumococcal vaccines with and without the concomitant vaccination with rotavirus vaccine. 
Reduced titres have been observed with the concomitant vaccination for 20vPnC and 13vPnc.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Immediate adverse events occurring within 30 minutes after vaccination
Immediate adverse events occurred in less than 1% of participants with no apparent difference between 
doses: In the study evaluating the 3-dose regimen: ~ 0.7%; in the pooled population for the 4-dose 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 186/198
regimen ~0.2%. The results are comparable between 20vPnC and 13vPnC in all studies and the pooled 
analysis set. The most common immediate adverse events were administration site conditions, e.g., 
injection site swelling, erythema pain and hypersensitivity.
Local reactions and systemic events occurring within 7 days after vaccination
These AEs include redness, swelling and pain at the injection site as local reactions and fever, decreased 
appetite, drowsiness and irritability as systemic events. 
Local reactions were observed in 15-45% of subjects (for details please refer to the effects table). Fever 
was reported in 8-24% of subjects. The other systemic events were more frequent: Irritability (~60-
70%), Drowsiness (~40-66%) and decreased appetite (~20-40%).
For the toddler dose, higher frequencies (difference 8-14%) with the 3-dose regimen were observed 
compared to the 4-dose regimen for all presented categories. Otherwise, frequencies are comparable 
between doses throughout the regimen.
In general, the reported events are mild to moderate and resolved within 1-3 days. Overall, the 
frequencies and severities are comparable between subjects that received 20vPnC and 13vPnC. 
In older children (2-18 years), the reported rates for redness and swelling are comparable to the infant 
studies. Pain at the injection site was reported by a higher percentage compared to the infant studies 
(52-80% vs 22-42%). Severity, onset of events and severity is comparable to the infant studies.
For children (2-18 years) evaluated systemic events included: fever, headache, fatigue and muscle or 
joint pain. The most frequently reported events are muscle pain (26.5%–48.3%) and fatigue (27.8%–
37.2%), followed by headache (5.6%–29.3%) and joint pain (3.7%–8.3%). Fever occurred mainly in 
younger children (3.3%) and only 1 report in the older cohorts. While the reported rates for fatigue and 
joint pain are rather constant with age. The rates for headache and muscle pain increase with age.
Other Adverse events 
The most common AEs are Infections and infestations (Conjunctivitis, Nasopharyngitis, Upper respiratory 
tract infection, Otitis media), pyrexia, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (Dermatitis atopic, Eczema) 
and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Overall, the reported AEs are similar between groups that 
received 20vPnc or 13vPnC. 
Other Adverse events were reported by 15%-32% of participants in the different studies. Similar 
reporting rates are presented for subjects receiving 13vPnC.
Related other Adverse Events
Vaccine-related AEs that were not reported as immediate events or as local reactions and systemic events 
occurring within 7 days after vaccination were reported in less than 1% of subjects in both vaccine arms 
and for all doses. The most common related AEs were injection site related events and diarrhoea. The 
results are generally similar for both vaccines.
Severe other Adverse Events 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 187/198
Less than 1% of subjects reported severe adverse events. Most reported AEs occurred only in one 
subject. Most severe events were Infections and infestations. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
No deaths were reported during the paediatric development programme. 
SAE occurred in less 5% of all subjects in the infant trials. The results between 20vPnC and 13vPnC are 
comparable. No trends between doses, age groups have been observed.
The most common SAEs are related to infections (Bronchiolitis, Gastroenteritis, Urinary tract infection, 
Pneumonia, Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and seizures 
(Febrile convulsion).
One SAE was considered related to study vaccine: Inflammation requiring hospitalization occurring 7 days 
after dose 1. The event resolved after the participant received antibiotics. 
In total 5 subjects withdraw due to SAEs in the 20vPnC vaccination groups (1 for 13vPnC). These events 
mainly include seizure-like events. 
Seizures were evaluated as other significant event included several seizure-like and related events. 
Overall, less than 0.5% of participants reported such events in all studies. This is comparable over all 
studies and between groups that received 20vPnC or 13vPnC. 
Special populations
One study included 110 late preterm infants (born with ≥34 to <37 weeks gestational age). The results 
are comparable to the safety profile of full-term infants. 
Discontinuations
Overall, the number subjects that withdrew due to adverse events or physician decision is low (all 
studies: adverse events: 20vPnC: 7, 13vPnC 4; physician decision: 20vPnC: 2, 13vPnC 4).
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
In the infant trials, all subjects received routine infant vaccinations concomitantly with 20vPnC and 
13vPnV: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Hib, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, hepatitis B MMR, and 
varicella. The observed safety profile between 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups are comparable and no safety 
signal was identified for any of these vaccinations.
Other vaccines have been administered in subgroups including rotavirus vaccine, influenza vaccine and 
hepatitis A vaccine. In study B7471011 (4-dose regimen) separate safety analyses were presented for the 
co-administration with influenza vaccine. About 10% more participants reported fever in the group 
receiving influenza vaccine concomitantly with either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. All other parameters indicate 
overall comparable safety profiles.
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Children 2-18 years
Children (2-18 years) were only evaluated in one single dose study. Overall, the dataset is limited to 622 
subjects and no comparator vaccine was applied. 
Special populations
Only one study included preterm infants. The results show no apparent differences in the safety profile 
compared to full term infants. However, only 110 preterm infants (20vPnC: 76, 13vPnC: 34) were 
included. Whether these subjects could be regarded as representative for pre-term infant in general 
required further clarification, since the included infants were born with ≥34 to <37 weeks gestational age 
and could therefore only be classified as late preterm infants. Supportive data from 13vPnC was provided 
indicating that the obtained results in this population are also representative for pre-term infants with 
lower GA. However, no data for 20vPnC is available for preterm infants with a gestational age of <34 
weeks.
No data is available for immunocompromised paediatric patients or paediatric patients with other risk 
factors.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
In the infant trials, no control group was included that did not receive the indicated paediatric 
vaccinations. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding potential differences between 
concomitant and separate vaccinations. 
Rotavirus vaccine and influenza vaccine have been administered in subgroups. For study B7471011 
separate safety analyses were presented for the co-administration with influenza vaccine and for study 
B7471012 separate safety analyses for rotavirus vaccine. 
In older paediatric subjects, non-study vaccines were concomitantly administered in small subgroups 
(Pentacel (DTaP, Hib, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine), hepatitis A vaccines; influenza vaccines, DTaP, 
and PedvaxHIB). The concomitantly vaccinated subgroups are however too small to draw valid 
conclusions.

Noninferiority of 20vPnC to 13vPnC. For the 13 shared serotypes, NI comparisons 
were made to the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC group. For the 7 additional 
serotypes, NI comparisons were made to the lowest among the 13 serotypes 
(except for serotype 3) in the 13vPnC group.
For the percentage of participants with a predefined IgG concentration for a 
serotype, non-inferiority was declared for a serotype if the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC – 13vPnC) in percentages is greater than –
10% (10% NI margin).
For the IgG GMC, non-inferiority was declared for a serotype if the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the IgG GMR of the 20vPnC group to the 13vPnC group is 
greater than 0.5 (2-fold NI margin).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
This application relies on establishing an immunological bridge to authorised vaccine with known 
protective efficacy against pneumococcal disease (13vPnC). No efficacy or effectiveness data has been 
submitted for 20vPnC. 20vPnC was immunogenic in all clinical studies, demonstrated by serotype-specific 
IgG and OPA antibodies to all 20 serotypes contained in the vaccine. 20vPnC was also able to induce 
immune memory.
Non-inferiority criteria were met for most shared serotypes after toddler dose in both pivotal studies 
B7471012 and B7471011, as measured by the percentage of participants with predefined IgG 
concentrations and IgG GMC. NI criteria for both parameters were also met for most of the shared 
serotypes after the last infant dose in the 4-dose regimen. In addition, no substantial differences between 
vaccines were seen for the response rate for the majority of shared serotypes after toddler dose in study 
B7471011. However, both pivotal trials formally failed to meet their primary objectives due to 
multiple failed NI tests. Missing the statistical NI criteria for individual serotypes for response rate and/or 
IgG GMC does not necessarily predict lack of vaccine efficacy and may not be completely unexpected due 
to the sheer number of NI comparisons made. From the MA assessment perspective, it is important to 
note that this uncertainty in prediction would also not rule out a clinically relevant lack of vaccine efficacy 
as a consequence of failed NI in IgG response. The key issue in this context remains the fact that – in 
absence of a reliable correlate of protection – the whole setup of the immunology NI evaluation relies on 
many pre-specifications and assumptions (e.g. IgG-concentration threshold for binary response 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 191/198
description, width of NI-margins, etc), such that actual NI conclusions (positive or negative) need to be 
per se considered rather uninformative as regards disease protective potential (vaccine efficacy).
Moreover, significant differences between vaccines were observed after the last infant dose in 
the 3-dose regimen (B7471012), demonstrated by multiple (15/40) failed NI tests for both primary 
parameters, response rate and IgG GMC. Differences between vaccines were also observed after last 
infant dose in 4-dose regimen, albeit to a lesser extent. Taking into consideration that the burden of IPD 
is highest in infants <1 year of age, the adequacy of the 3-dose regimen to achieve and maintain 
protection, especially in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose, raises major concerns.  
Additional arguments provided by the Applicant did not dissipate major concerns regarding the efficacy of 
the 2+1 regimen. These uncertainties are not restricted to one or two serotypes but pertain to all 
serotypes included in the vaccine. Similar uncertainties also apply to the 3+1 regimen, albeit to a lesser 
extent. Furthermore, consistently lower IgG GMC have been observed for all 13 shared serotypes 
in 20vPnC group compared to 13vPnC group. The implications of this reduction on the vaccine efficacy 
and protection against pneumococcal disease is unclear. 
In addition to lower immune response to 13 shared serotypes and unknown clinical relevance thereof, 
several limitations regarding the ‘benefit’ of additional 7 serotypes should be mentioned. Firstly, 
the approach for NI comparisons of the 7 additional serotypes against the lowest observed response 
among the vaccine serotypes in the 13vPnC group (excluding serotype 3) is considered uninformative and 
might even be potentially misleading, with a clear systematic tendency for overestimation of the 20vPnC 
benefit. Secondly, two different assays (13-plex dLIA and 7-plex dLIA) were used to obtain antibody titres 
for the 13 serotypes also contained in 13vPnC and the 7 additional serotypes, respectively. This design 
does not allow quantitative comparisons between the two sets of serotypes since the influence of specific 
serotype combinations on the dLIA measurement of serotype-specific IgG concentrations is unclear. 
Consequently, the determination of NI for the 7 additional serotypes is rather uninformative. Finally, the 
cut-off value of ≥0.35 µg/mL was derived from 7vPnC data as a surrogate of protection, and the 
applicability of this level to 7 additional serotypes is less clear. Taken together, immune response of 
the 7 additional parameters cannot be reliably assessed using parameters of primary interest 
(response rate and IgG GMC). The assessment of secondary parameters such as IgG and OPA GMFRs 
clearly shows that 7 additional parameters induce serotype-specific immune response, however the 
clinical relevance thereof and in how far this translates into protection remains unclear. 
Given the overall better immunogenicity results, the 4-dose regimen is more likely to provide 
protection against the pneumococcal disease. Nonetheless, the effectiveness thereof needs to be 
confirmed in the post-marketing, especially for the 7 additional serotypes, as the interpretation of data 
from pivotal studies regarding these serotypes was severely limited.
In addition, a surrogate of protection, IgG of 0.35 µg/mL, after 3 infant doses, has been established for 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children, which can be used to infer protection against IPD. 
However, for pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM), no correlate or surrogate of protection exists. 
13vPnC has been shown to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated children has 
been observed. Importantly though, no exact vaccine efficacy estimate was determined, nor the immune 
response required to achieve protection. Therefore, the strategy of NI testing for 20vPnC to 13vPnC, 
especially when a lower immune response is observed for 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC, introduces the 
possibility that 20vPnC might not be effective against pneumonia and AOM. Moreover, it is currently 
unknown whether the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL can also be considered protective for the new serotypes 
included in this vaccine for any indication. 
Finally, due to the overall lower IgG GMCs with 20vPnC, it can be expected that the (assumed) protective 
effect wanes earlier compared to 13vPnC.

EMA/66027/2024

Regarding the administration of a single dose of Prevenar 20 to infants and children fully immunised with 
Prevenar13, 20vPnC elicited immediate serotype-specific immune response to all 7 additional serotypes, 
however it is unclear whether a single (priming) dose of 20vPnC is sufficient to achieve protection against 
the 7 extra serotypes and to induce robust immunological memory. This is particularly important for 
children under the age of 5, as the burden of pneumococcal disease in this age group is substantial. 
Previous experience with Prevenar-13 provides support that a single dose can offer some level of 
protection against additional serotypes, which is considered important for children at higher risk of 
pneumococcal disease.  
Overall, the safety profile of 20vPnC is comparable to 13vPnC. The identified differences between 3-dose 
and 4-dose regimen are manageable but should be considered together with the observed uncertainties 
regarding the 3dose regimen detailed above. 
Additionally, the CHMP convened a SAG inviting the experts to provide their views on the immunogenicity 
results for the 2+1 regimen, the potential benefit of 7 additional serotypes, and the need for the 2+1 
regimen for 20vPnC. The view of the SAG has been implemented in the assessment report (please refer 
to the section 2.4.2 for details) and has been taken into consideration for the final benefit/risk 
assessment on the 2+1 regimen.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
20vPnC was immunogenic in all clinical studies, demonstrated by serotype-specific IgG antibodies to all 
20 serotypes contained in the vaccine. This is important as it suggest that it could potentially provide 
broader coverage over approved pneumococcal conjugated vaccines against serotypes most responsible 
for serious pneumococcal disease among children <5 years of age. However, due to many uncertainties, 
the actual ‘benefit’ of the 7 additional serotypes cannot reliably be assessed by the means of response 
rate and IgG GMC. Assessment of secondary parameters such as IgG and OPA GMFRs clearly shows that 
7 additional parameters induce serotype-specific immune response, however the clinical relevance thereof 
remains unclear. Although efficacy has not been demonstrated and cannot be inferred for these additional 
serotypes through immunobridging, based on previous experience with the immune response to the other 
PCV serogroups the demonstration of IgG titres and functional immune responses are likely to translate 
into protective efficacy, but the exact level may not be clear.
In addition, consistently lower IgG GMCs have been observed for all 13 shared serotypes in 20vPnC group 
compared to 13vPnC group. It is uncertain whether the lower immunogenicity has a negative impact on 
the vaccine effectiveness. This is of particular concern for the 3-dose regimen, as differences between 
20vPnC and 13vPnC observed after the last infant dose were significant, demonstrated by multiple 
(15/40) failed NI tests for both response rate and IgG GMC. Given the high burden of invasive 
pneumococcal disease in paediatric population in infants <1 year of age, it is crucial that vaccines offer 
sufficient protection in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose (between 6 and 12 
months of age). Furthermore, a substantial disease burden in this age group is also due to pneumonia 
and acute otitis media. As higher antibody responses are thought to be necessary for the protection 
against pneumonia and AOM compared to IPD, there is an additional concern that 20vPnC might not offer 
sufficient protection to infants. 
It is important to reiterate that the uncertainties associated with the 2+1 dose regimen, particularly 
following the last infant dose, pertain not only to one or two serotypes but to the majority of shared 
serotypes. While the current circulation of the 13vPnC serotypes may be low due to the indirect (herd) 
protection elicited via high uptake of the toddler dose, it is essential to underscore that this herd 
immunity is contingent upon the effectiveness of vaccines currently available on the market. Considering 
Assessment report 
EMA/66027/2024
Page 193/198
the anticipated replacement of Prevenar-13 by 20vPnC, the numerous uncertainties regarding the efficacy 
of the latter pose a potential risk to this established herd immunity. Additionally, relying on herd 
immunity to justify a vaccine with significantly lower immunogenicity and substantial uncertainties about 
its translation into efficacy is not deemed acceptable. Although herd immunity plays an important role 
regarding indirect protection, a vaccine should offer direct protection after vaccination. In this specific 
case, the most critical time frame of individual risk for disease is between the last infant dose and the 
toddler dose. Since inference of efficacy is contingent upon the demonstration of non-inferiority, efficacy 
cannot be inferred from the data.
According to the ECDC data from 2019, five serotypes (serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F and 15B) unique to 
20vPnC caused 25% of remaining IPD in children age <1 year in Europe. While the potential benefit of 
the additional serotypes notwithstanding the previously mentioned uncertainties is acknowledged, this 
‘unmet medical need’ may be overestimated, as the distribution of serotypes and the transmission 
dynamics change over time. 
While post-authorisation effectiveness evaluation can be used to address some uncertainties present at 
the time of the assessment, pre-authorisation immunogenicity data should be sufficiently convincing. The 
benefit: risk of the 3-dose (2+1) regimen is thus considered to be negative. It is important to note, that 
regardless the uncertainties in relation to the 7 additional serotypes, a broader coverage of a 20-valent 
vaccine cannot overcome the concerns regarding potential lack of efficacy for the 13 shared serotypes. A 
vaccine is expected to induce protection against all included serotypes and addition of new serotypes is 
not considered of benefit if significantly impacting the efficacy against “previous” serotypes in a negative 
manner.
Given the overall better immunogenicity, the 4-dose (3+1) regimen is in more likelihood to achieve and 
maintain protection, especially in the window between the last infant and the toddler dose. The efficacy of 
the 4-dose regimen needs to be confirmed post-marketing, also for the additional 7 serotypes as the 
interpretation of data from pivotal studies regarding these serotypes was severely limited. To this effect, 
a post-authorisation commitment [REC] has been drawn up.
20vPnC is in general well tolerated and the reported AEs are considered well manageable. 
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit: risk of Prevenar 20, 4 dose (3+1) regimen ONLY, for the indication: “Active 
immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of 
age.” is positive.  
The Applicant has accepted to remove 3-dose regimen from the SmPC (section 4.2) and provided updated 
PI accordingly. That dosing is only mentioned in the section 5.1 in accordance with the paediatric 
regulation.

Reminders to the MAH
1.
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature.
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
9 February 2024. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 9 February 2024. We would like to remind you that, according to 
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal 
data’ means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data 
subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in 
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an 
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, 
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data). 
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.”
2.
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU.
3.
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

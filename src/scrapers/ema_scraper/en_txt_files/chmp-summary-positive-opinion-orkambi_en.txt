Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Orkambi 
lumacaftor / ivacaftor 
On 24 September 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Orkambi, 
intended for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Orkambi was designated as an orphan medicinal 
product on 22 August 2014. The applicant for this medicinal product is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) 
Ltd. 
Orkambi is a fixed-dose combination of two active substances, lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and will be 
available as 200 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets (ATC code: R07AX30). Orkambi is to be used in patients 
with the specific F508del mutation affecting the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
This gene encodes for the CFTR protein which is a chloride channel normally present at the surface of 
epithelial cells in multiple organs. Lumacaftor improves the cellular processing and trafficking of the 
F508del-CFTR protein to the cell membrane, while ivacaftor facilitates the function of the CFTR protein by 
increasing the CFTR channel gating. The combined effect of lumacaftor and ivacaftor results in increased 
quantity and function of F508del-CFTR protein at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride ion 
transport.  
The benefits of Orkambi are its ability to improve pulmonary function [measured as the absolute change 
from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1)], increase the body 
weight and decrease the rate of pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients homozygous with F508del-CFTR. 
Mean improvement in ppFEV1, although of limited magnitude, was rapid in onset (15 days after starting 
treatment), sustained throughout the 48 week treatment period and observed regardless of age, disease 
severity, sex and geographic region. The most common side effects in patients aged 12 years and older 
who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor were dyspnoea, diarrhoea, and nausea. 
The full indication is: "Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1)."  
It is proposed that Orkambi be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of CF. If the 
patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

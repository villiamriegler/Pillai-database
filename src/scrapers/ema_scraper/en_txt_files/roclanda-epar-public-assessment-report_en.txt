2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Roclanda is a fixed dose combination of two IOP lowering agents netarsudil 0.02% (authorised by the 
EMA in 2019) and latanoprost 0.005%. The indication sought for the medicinal product is for the 
reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or 
ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Primary open angle glaucoma 
accounts for approximately 74% of all glaucoma cases worldwide. In Europe the population prevalence 
of primary open angle glaucoma was estimated to be 2% in the population aged over 40 years in 
2015.   
Risk factors include increasing age, family history, elevated intraocular pressure and race, with persons 
of African origin having a higher risk of developing open angle glaucoma. 
Elevated intraocular pressure is the most important known risk factor for primary open angle 
glaucoma. Reduction of raised intraocular pressure has been shown in studies to reduce or delay the 
development of open angle glaucoma. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and 
can eventually lead to blindness due to progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting 
changes in the head of the optic nerve. The pathophysiology of open angle glaucoma is not fully 
understood. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss 
though ocular hypertension is not a feature in all cases of glaucoma. 
The intraocular pressure is influenced by the balance between the aqueous humour secreted by the 
ciliary body and drainage through two independent pathways, the trabecular meshwork and the 
uvoscleral outflow pathway. Patients with raised intraocular pressure and open angle glaucoma have 
increased resistance to aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The early stages of the condition are asymptomatic and patients may not present until they have 
significant visual field loss. The condition is often detected during routine eye examinations on the 
basis of raised intraocular pressure or fundal changes. Visual acuity is unaffected as long as central 
vision is preserved.  
Glaucoma is diagnosed in patients with characteristic nerve damage on fundus examination and visual 
field testing, usually in the presence of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 9/145 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
The aim of open angle glaucoma treatment is to lower intraocular pressure in order to preserve visual 
function. There is evidence that lowering intraocular pressure in case of intraocular hypertension or 
open angle glaucoma (even when the patient has normal intraocular pressure) can delay progression 
and reduce the risk of developing visual field loss or delay exacerbation of visual field loss. IOP 
lowering therapy can be pharmacological (mainly topical) or surgical (including laser therapy). First line 
therapy is usually a topical product e.g. prostaglandins, beta blockers and less frequently alpha 
adrenergic agonists. Topical prostaglandins are more frequently used in Europe as initial therapy, in 
particular latanoprost. In the case of inadequate reduction of IOP, the European Glaucoma Society 
Guidelines recommend using another monotherapy or combination therapy. In the event of failure with 
ocular pharmacological therapies laser or surgical treatment is an option. 
About the product 
Roclanda belongs to Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and 
miotics, ATC code: S01EE51. 
Roclanda is a fixed dose combination of two active substances: netarsudil (a Rho kinase inhibitor) and 
latanoprost (a prostaglandin analogue). These two components lower intraocular pressure by 
increasing the outflow of aqueous humour. Although both netarsudil and latanoprost lower IOP by 
increasing aqueous humour outflow, their mechanisms of action are different. 
Studies in animal and man suggest that the main mechanism of action for netarsudil, a Rho kinase 
inhibitor, is increased trabecular outflow. These studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by 
reducing episcleral venous pressure.  
Studies in animal and man indicate that the main mechanism of action for latanoprost, a prostaglandin 
F2α analoque, is increased uveoscleral ouflow, although some increase in outflow facility (decrease in 
outflow resistance) has been reported in man. 
Roclanda is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with 
primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP 
reduction. 
The recommended posology is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Latanoprost 
General information 
The chemical name (IUPAC) of latanoprost is propan-2-yl (5Z)-7-[(1R,2R,3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxy-2-
[(3R)-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl]cyclopentyl]hept-5-enoate. It corresponds to the molecular formula 
C26H40O5, its relative molecular mass is 432.6 and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of latanoprost 
Latanoprost appears as a light yellow to yellowish liquid viscous oil. It is practically insoluble in water 
but freely soluble in alcohols, chloroform, and acetone. When dissolved or suspended in water its pH 
is 6.8-7.2. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of by infrared 
spectroscopy (IR), 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry (MS), and elemental analysis. 
Latanoprost has 5 asymmetric centres at the positions C8, C9, C11, C12 and C15 and one geometric 
centre at C5 and C6. The synthesis and the controls applied the intermediates and process parameters 
ensure the desired configuration. 
Latanoprost is a liquid oil and therefore does not show polymorphism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
The manufacturing process consists of 9 steps. The starting materials are acceptable and are controlled 
by suitable specifications. The isolated intermediates are defined and are also sufficiently controlled.  
In addition, acceptable specifications for reagents, solvents and other materials used in the synthesis 
have been provided. Critical steps of the process were identified and are controlled by justified and 
appropriate in-process controls.  
The characterisation of LTP and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of 
new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin 
and characterised. The information presented regarding potential impurities/degradation products 
controlled in the active substance is sufficient. Overall the defined control strategy is satisfactory. 
LTP packaging has been described and it complies with the applicable Ph. Eur. requirement.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 11/145 
 
 
 
 
Specification 
The specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), identification (IR, HPLC 
and UV), optical rotation (USP), water content (KF), residue on ignition (USP), assay (HPLC, USP), 
related substances (HPLC, USP), residual solvents (GC) and microbiological limits (USP/Ph. Eur.). 
The active substance specification applied by the two finished product manufacturers are the same in 
terms of parameters and limits but differ in some methods applied; this is acceptable.   
The specification limits for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents, are in accordance 
with the requirements of ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C. The impurity limits are in line with the recently 
adopted Ph. Eur. monograph (coming into force on 2021-01-01) and are acceptable. The differences 
between the in-house and Ph. Eur. specifications have been adequately compared. All solvents used 
throughout the entire synthetic process of LTP are controlled in the specification and specified at levels 
below the ICH Q3C thresholds. For any tests not included in the specification sufficient justifications 
have been provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, the CHMP requested some 
supplementary method verification information, which is agreeable to be provided post-authorisation 
within an agreed timeframe. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay 
and impurities testing has been presented.  
Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated. Batch analysis 
data from two production scale batches generated by both finished product manufacturers is provided, 
demonstrating compliance with the proposed specifications. However, the CHMP requested some 
supplementary analysis data, which is agreeable to be provided post-authorisation within an agreed 
timeframe. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 pilot scale primary stability batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term 
conditions (5±3°C) and for six months under accelerated conditions (30±2°C / 65%±5% RH or 
25±2°C / 65%±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. For these batches, one key 
intermediate was coming from a site used earlier in the development. In addition, stability data from 
another 6 pilot scale batches of active substance including batches manufactured completely by the 
current manufacturing sites stored in the intended commercial package for up to 6 months under long 
term conditions (5±3°C) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (30±2°C / 65%±5% RH or 
25±2°C / 65%±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Samples were tested for description, water content, related substances and assay. No significant 
changes were observed to any of the measured parameters in any of the tested batches. No actual 
trends are seen in the study except for an increase in moisture observed in samples under both 
storage conditions. All samples met the specifications. However, a difference has been observed 
between the level of impurities over time between LTP batches generated from the key intermediate 
manufactured from the earlier and current sites. Considering that stability data from the current key 
intermediate manufacturing site cover only 6 months, the results from the previous site cannot be 
extrapolated. Thus, while a retest period of 36 months is acceptable for existing latanoprost batches 
manufactured by the previous key intermediate manufacturing site only a shorter retest period can be 
accepted for latanoprost derived from the current key intermediate manufacturing site.

A forced degradation study evaluating degradation under acidic (0.01 N HCl for 2-6 h), alkaline (0.01 N 
NaOH for 2-6 h), oxidative (0.3% H2O2 for 8-24 h), heat (80°C for 1-2 days) and light conditions (ICH 
Q1B) was presented. All peaks passed the peak purity test. Varying degree of degradation was 
observed among the different stressed conditions; the active substance is not photosensitive. The 
assay and related substances method were shown to be stability indicating. 
Based on the overall data a re-test period of 12 months when stored at 2-8 °C under a nitrogen 
blanket is acceptable for future batches manufactured by the proposed sites.  
Netarsudil 
General information 
The chemical name of netarsudil mesylate is {4-[(1S)-2-amino-1-[(isoquinolin-6-yl)carbamoyl]ethyl] 
phenyl} methyl 2,4-dimethylbenzoate, methanesulfonate (1:2). It corresponds to the molecular 
formula C30H35N3O9S2 (dimesilate salt) (C28H27N3O3 (free base)), its relative molecular mass is 645.74 
g/mol (dimesilate salt) (453.53 g/mol (free base)) and it has the structure shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Structure of netarsudil mesylate 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis (EA), 
mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 
and X-ray powder diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffractometric (XRD) analysis was performed to 
confirm the absolute stereochemistry. 
Netarsudil mesylate appears as a light yellow to white, moderately hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It 
is freely soluble in water and soluble in methanol. Its partition coefficient (LogP) was determined to be 
4.44 and two pKa values were determined to be pKa1: 5.43 and pKa2: 7.91. 
It has a single stereocentre and is produced selectively as a single enantiomer of the (S)-configuration. 
The synthesis was designed to produce the ‘S’ enantiomer. The absolute stereochemistry was 
established from single-crystal X-ray analysis of the penultimate intermediate. 
Netarsudil mesylate exhibits polymorphism. The polymorphic form of the active substance used in the 
finished product has been discussed and justified.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in six steps from well-defined starting materials. The starting 
materials have been adequately justified and are controlled to acceptable specifications. Purging of 
impurities has been demonstrated. 
Isolated intermediates during the active substance manufacturing process were stated. Acceptable 
specifications analytical methods and batch information were provided for the control of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020

intermediates. The optimisation of the manufacturing process during development has been described 
in sufficient detail. Critical steps were identified, and a suitable control strategy has been defined. 
Appropriate and justified in-process controls are in place. Critical and key process parameters have 
been identified for each manufacturing step and normal operating ranges (NORs) proposed.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The selection of the dimesylate salt form of netarsudil has 
been justified sufficiently based on solubility considerations and assessment of the risk of formation of 
alkyl methanesulfonate impurities during the active substance manufacturing process and on storage.  
The control limit for potential methanesulfonates is well below the ICH M7 accepted TTC of 1.5 μg/day 
and well below the published PDEs of the individual methanesulfonate esters. 
Netarsudil packaging has been described and it complies with the applicable Ph. Eur.  and EU 
regulations requirements. 
Specification 
Netarsudil mesylate active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), chiral impurity 
((R)-enantiomer - chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
methanesulfonates (GC-HS), residual solvents (GC-HS), methanesulfonic acid content (IC), water 
content (KF), and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The mesylate salt content of netarsudil (counter-ion) is determined from the assay for methanesulfonic 
acid using ICP. Methanesulfonates are controlled at acceptably justified limits in accordance with ICH 
M7. 
Considering the route of synthesis, the risk for Class 1 solvents to be present in the active substance is 
deemed to be insignificant, and therefore the inclusion of tests for Class 1 solvents in the specification 
is not considered necessary. In addition to the risk assessment this was further supported by batch 
analysis data.  
Limits for elemental impurities meet the requirements of ICH Q3D permitted daily intakes (PDEs). To 
date, none of the elemental impurities have been observed above the specification limits.  
For any tests not included in the specification sufficient justifications have been provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analyses data for a number of active substance batches have been provided. The batch scale 
ranges from lab to pilot to commercial scale. The data demonstrate that netarsudil mesilate within 
specification is consistently produced. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale and three pilot scale batches of active substance stored in the 
intended commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (-20±5ºC), and for up 
to 12 months under accelerated conditions (5±3°C) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
Supportive data from two further pilot batches for up to 48 months under long-term conditions

(-20±5°C) and 12 months under accelerated conditions (5±3°C) was also provided. All batches of 
active substance were manufactured using the commercial synthetic route at the proposed site.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, chromatographic purity, water content, chiral purity (not 
tested for one of supportive batches), methanesulfonates (not tested for both supportive batches), 
microbial bioburden (not tested for both supportive batches). No significant changes were observed to 
any of the measured parameters in any of the tested batches. All samples met the specifications 
demonstrating the chemical stability of netarsudil mesylate. 
In order to evaluate any potential impact on the stability profile of netarsudil mesylate due to the 
change in starting material supplier, data from two pilot scale batches of netarsudil mesylate 
manufactured by the new supplier was presented. Up to 9 months long term and 6 months accelerated 
data was available indicating that these two batches also meet the specification. In addition, data from 
another commercial batch stored for 12 months under long term conditions were presented and results 
are in line with the above. The data from these last two pilot and one commercial batch corroborate 
the proposed retest period for netarsudil mesylate made at the commercial scale using the commercial 
equipment and process. 
Photostability 
Photostability of netarsudil mesylate was studied on a pilot batch as per ICH Photostability Option 2 
conditions in a clear glass bottle, an amber bottle, and an amber bottle wrapped in foil (control). 
Tested parameters were description, water, methanesulfonates, chiral impurity, assay, and 
chromatographic purity. All specifications were met. However, the sample in clear glass bottle showed 
a slight increase in unspecified impurities whereas the samples in the amber bottle and control samples 
did not, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed amber glass container. 
Stress studies 
Stress studies were performed for the two supportive batches and one pilot batch at 25±2°C / 60±5% 
RH for a period of 12, 6 and 3 months, respectively. The data demonstrate that the stability of the 
active substance is maintained for an excursion period of up to 3 months at the stressed condition of 
25±2°C / 60±5% RH. 
Freeze/Thaw studies 
Samples of netarsudil mesylate were subjected to 5 freeze/thaw cycles between -20±5°C and 
controlled room temperature. All specifications were met. These data demonstrate that the chemical 
stability of the netarsudil mesilate in simulated use is maintained when using the proposed container. 
Based on the provided data, the proposed retest period of 36 months for the active substance when 
stored at -20°C protected from light and moisture is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Roclanda eye drop solution is a clear, sterile, ophthalmic solution in a multi-dose container, containing 
50 μg/ml latanoprost and 200 μg/ml of netarsudil (as mesylate salt) as active substances in a fixed dose 
combination (FDC). 
The formulation is an isotonic solution with a pH ≈5, preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK). 
Roclanda eye drops are developed based on the previously approved Rhokiinsa formulation with 
addition of latanoprost active substance and relevant adjustment of excipients. The selection of the 
dimesilate salt form of netarsudil and the ‘S’ enantiomer have been adequately justified was based on 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 15/145 
 
 
 
physicochemical, stability and pharmacological considerations. The finished product is designed as a 
multi-dose product for ophthalmic application and is intended to conform to the characteristics for 
topical ophthalmic solutions.  
The Quality Target Product Profile was defined and drove the formulation and manufacturing process 
development. The excipients used (boric acid, mannitol, benzalkonium chloride and sodium hydroxide) 
are standard compendial materials typically used in other ophthalmic formulations in approved 
products in the EU. The same formulation composition has been used in repeat dose ocular toxicology 
studies. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
The compatibility of netarsudil and latanoprost with each other, and the compatibility of each active 
substance with the excipients in the formulation and the container closure system, have been 
investigated. It is concluded that the active substances are compatible with each other and with the 
other components of the finished product.  
The desired pH of the formulation was determined to be approximately pH 5. 
The finished product is a weakly-buffered isotonic solution with a pH of approximately pH 4.9. The pH 
and tonicity of the formulation are controlled by boric acid and mannitol. The use of boric acid in 
ophthalmic products is well established as detailed in EMA questions and answers on boric acid and 
borates used as excipients in medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/619104/2013). For ocular 
comfort, the product is made isotonic using mannitol. The finished product buffer capacity was 
investigated and determined in relation to human tears so that the product buffer capacity is lower 
than the tear buffer capacity. 
Sodium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH of the final formulation. Water for Injection is used 
throughout the manufacturing process for the dissolution of excipients and adjustment of the product 
formulation to its final batch size. No novel excipients are used. 
The necessity to add the preservative has been demonstrated according to CPMP/CVMP/QWP/115/95 
(1997) Note for Guidance on Inclusion of antioxidants and antimicrobial preservatives in medicinal 
products. Antimicrobial Effectiveness Test (AET) data collected at release, during stability and under in-
use conditions (28 days after 2 years of storage) has thus far demonstrated conformance of the 
product to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3. Based on all the information presented, the proposed concentration of BAK 
in the finished product can be accepted from a quality perspective. The CHMP has acknowledged the 
applicant’s plans to optimise preservative concentrations in both netarsudil monotherapy and fixed 
dose combination (FDC) formulations.  
Manufacturing process development  
Manufacturer A manufactured all Phase 3 clinical batches and the original registration stability batches. 
The finished product formulation was subsequently transferred to Manufacturer B and process 
validation/registration stability batches were manufactured. As such, no additional formulation 
development studies were conducted at Manufacturer B. 
The formulation used for Phase 1 and 2 studies was similar to the Phase 3 pivotal trials except the 
concentration of the netarsudil active substance was either 0.01% or 0.02%. The proposed commercial 
formulation of Roclanda eye drops is identical to the formulation used for the Phase 3 pivotal trials, 
registration stability, and process validation batches.  
The finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been identified and appropriately justified. 
The CQAs formed the basis for the specifications for the finished product. A process Failure Modes and 
Effects Analysis (pFMEA) was performed to assess process-related failure modes associated with the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 16/145 
 
 
 
 
major manufacturing steps. No failure mode was identified as having a meaningful risk to the 
manufacturing process. Following completion of the pFMEA, the critical process parameters (CPPs) 
were established and challenged in the process validation as captured in the process validation. 
Process validation studies concluded that the manufacturing process is robust and the pFMEA analysis 
concluded that all significant risks were appropriately mitigated. 
The manufacturing process is typical for aqueous ophthalmic solutions and has been optimised 
specifically in each of the two proposed manufacturing sites and intended batch sizes. The differences 
in equipment among the sites and certain minor differences in batch size, mixing and mixing time, 
filtration and filling process have been adequately discussed. The sterilisation method has been 
sufficiently justified in accordance with the relevant sterilisation guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) decision tree. The sterilising steps for the packaging 
components have also been presented and are deemed acceptable.  
Container closure system 
The proposed container closure system (CCS) for the product is a 4 ml multi-dose, natural low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE) bottle fitted with a linear low-density polyethylene dropper tip (LLDPE) and white 
polypropylene (PP) screw cap. A polyvinyl chloride tamper-evident seal is shrink-wrapped over the cap 
and the neck of the bottle. The actual fill volume is 2.5 mL.  
The type, size, and materials of construction of the proposed CCS are similar to container systems 
widely used for the administration of ophthalmic solutions. The resins and colorants used in the bottle, 
tip, and cap comply with Regulation (EC) No. 10/2011 (as amended) for plastics intended to come in 
contact with food and with relevant Ph. Eur. requirements. The choice of CCS has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Light protection of the product is 
provided by the carton. CCS integrity was demonstrated by appropriately designed and conducted 
study.  
The CCS has also been studied for leachables/extractables. Product-specific studies have demonstrated 
acceptable levels of leachables with this CCS, when in contact with the finished product, at the tested 
conditions. 
A dose delivery study on representative filled bottles from the three registration stability batches filled 
in the commercial bottle and tip was conducted to quantify the total number of drops dispensed and 
the average weight per drop. The data demonstrate that the ophthalmic solution can be reproducibly 
dosed with the selected container closure system.  
The usability of the CCS is similar to other marketed ophthalmic products that have extensive use both 
in the community and worldwide. Both patient experience and suitability of the proposed CCS were 
evaluated through use in two Phase 3 clinical trials. The age of these patients ranged from 18 to 88 
years, reflecting the age range of the target population proposed for this product. There were no 
reported complaints about the usability of the product or container closure system within the whole 
age range of patients. This indicates that the type, size, shape, and usability of the selected container 
closure system is adequate and provides evidence that the expected patient population for the product 
can effectively and reproducibly self-administer the eye drops according to the recommended 
instructions for administration. 
A risk assessment was conducted in line with guidance (ISO 14971, Medical devices – Applications of 
risk management to medical devices; EMA Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of 
medicines for use in the older population; PRAC Good practice guide on risk minimisation and 
prevention of medication errors). For two identified risks that according to ISO 14971 require risk 
reduction to the lowest practicable level, appropriate risk mitigation measures have been put in place. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 17/145 
 
 
 
Overall, the choice of the CCS has been sufficiently justified, its function satisfactorily documented and 
is considered appropriate for this product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Two manufacturing sites have been clearly stated. The manufacturing consists of the following main 
steps compounding of the formulation, pH adjustment, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling of bulk solution into pre-sterilized CCS. The process is non-standard because of the 
aseptic filling. Slightly different manufacturing processes were presented for the manufacture at the 
two sites. The differences are minor and were adequately explained; the manufacturing processes at 
two sites can be considered equivalent.  
The validation reports for the sterilisation of the CCS were presented in the process and are acceptable. 
The chosen filters were shown to be suitable for the filtering of the finished product by the performed 
filter validation studies. 
Critical steps have been identified. Set points for critical process parameters were established based on 
a risk assessment and confirmed by process validation. The proposed in-process controls are adequate 
for  this  type  pharmaceutical  form.  Site  specific  lists  of  IPCs  implemented  have  been  presented.  In 
addition, details of media fill batches from both sites were presented where the maximum filling time 
was simulated. The proposed holding times for both sites are acceptable. The commercial batch size has 
been clearly stated. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail.  
Process validation data on three commercial scale batches manufactured at each site were provided. 
All batches met the in-process and finished product acceptance criteria. The presented process 
validation data suggest that the process is adequately controlled, reproducible and robust, and yields a 
product that complies with the specifications. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), description of container (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), identification 
of netarsudil  (UV, HPLC), identification of latanoprost (UV, HPLC), identification of BAK (HPLC), assay 
of netarsudil  (HPLC), assay of latanoprost (HPLC), degradation products of netarsudil  (HPLC), 
degradation products of latanoprost (HPLC), chiral impurity (chiral HPLC), BAK content (HPLC), 
particulate matter (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The specifications parameters and limits are the 
same for both manufacturers but the analytical methods differ.  
The proposed limits are in in accordance with the requirements of ICH Q6A and ICH Q3B. Limits for 
degradation product and/or impurities have been toxicologically qualified where relevant and are in line 
with the applicable Ph. Eur. monograph.   
During pharmaceutical development it was shown that the formulation retains acceptable antimicrobial 
activity, which was also supported by the antimicrobial effectiveness test results during 
registration/process validation stability studies. Based on that, testing for AET is not included in the 
finished product specification (as the BAK content is measured at release and on stability).  
With regards to viscosity and density, the formulation design, batch data and historical data warrant 
that these parameters do not need to be in the product specification. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed in line with 
the ICH Q3D Option 2a using a risk-based approach for potential ocular adverse effect.  The risk 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 18/145 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment report also addresses the suitability of applying the oral route PDE limits in ICH Q3D to the 
ocular route of administration. In general, the oral route limits were applied, since the oral route of 
exposure was considered the most relevant for topically administered ocular drugs with regards to 
systemic exposure. A literature search was performed to identify any toxicity information relevant to 
the topical ocular route of administration. For any evidence of local effects, the literature limits were 
compared to the ICH PDE. If a difference was observed, correction factors were applied when relevant 
exposure data were available. The performed risk assessment demonstrated the risk of elemental 
impurity introduction from the raw materials, container closure system and manufacturing process is 
very low and no further controls are warranted in the specification. As such, the control strategy for 
elemental impurities is deemed sufficient and no further controls are required.  
Risk assessments, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data was provided for 11 finished product batches manufactured by Manufacturer A and 
used in nonclinical, clinical, stability and process validation studies, including one commercial product 
batch. Data from another two batches manufactured by a development site at a smaller scale were also 
provided. Results comply with the specifications. 
Batch analysis data was provided for 3 full-scale batches manufactured by Manufacturer B and used in 
stability and process validation studies. Results comply with the specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Manufacturer A batches 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches (primary stability batches) of finished product stored in 
inverted and upright positions for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 5±3°C and for six 
months under accelerated conditions at 25±2°C / 40%±5% RH and 30±2°C / 65%±5% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines have been presented. Data from the process validation (full-scale) batches stored 
in upright positions for up to 18 months under long term conditions have been also presented. These 6 
batches were packaged into the proposed container system. 
The following attributes were assessed for the primary stability batches: description, pH, osmolality, 
netarsudil assay and degradation products, netarsudil chiral impurity, latanoprost assay and 
degradation products, benzalkonium chloride content, particulate matter, sterility, antimicrobial 
effectiveness, leachables, and weight loss/gain. The methods were the same used for release and any 
differences have been described. The stability indicating properties of the assay and degradation 
products methods have been demonstrated. 
No significant differences between units stored upright or horizontal were observed. Both netarsudil 
and latanoprost degradation products increased especially in accelerated conditions. Latanoprost assay 
values decrease but results were variable. The CHMP recommended that the applicant provides the 
outcome of the re-evaluation of the latanoprost assay limits at shelf-life as per the presented schedule 
(REC3). No significant trends in the long-term results can be seen up to the present time-point. In 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020

general, though, all tested parameters, including degradation products and assay values, remained 
within the specification.  
For the process validation batches in stability the following attributes have been assessed: description, 
pH, osmolality, netarsudil assay and degradation products, netarsudil chiral impurity, benzalkonium 
chloride (preservative content), particulate matter, and sterility. No significant changes have been 
observed to date. Furthermore, no significant trend in the long-term results can be seen up to the 
present time-point.  
Supportive stability data were presented from another four pilot scale batches stored in inverted and 
upright positions for up to 18 months under long term conditions and for up to six months under 
accelerated conditions. These batches were also packaged into the proposed container system but 
having a slightly different tip. No significant difference in stability has been noted to date between the 
primary stability batches, process validation and supportive batches. 
A photostability study was conducted per ICH Q1B, Option 2, on a pilot batch. The samples in the primary 
packaging  (natural  bottle)  exposed  to  light,  did  not  meet  the  acceptance  criteria  with  regards  to 
netarsudil  and  latanoprost  assay  and  drug-related  degradation  products.  However,  when  the  primary 
container was stored in the secondary packaging (carton), all acceptance criteria were met for product 
exposed  to  light.  Results  of  the  photostability  study  indicate  that  the  combination  of  primary  and 
secondary packaging (natural bottles in cartons) provides sufficient protection from light for the drug 
product. The statement “Store in the original carton in order to protect from light” is included in SmPC 
6.4. 
A freeze thaw study evaluating two different freeze-thaw conditions was conducted using a pilot batch. 
The study results demonstrate that the finished product is stable after multiple freeze thaw cycles.  
Data collected for samples stored at stress conditions 30±2°C / 35%±5% RH and 40±2°C / 20%±5 % 
RH were also provided. The results demonstrated that during shipment, the finished product is robust 
with regards to short-term temperature excursions from the proposed long-term storage condition that 
may be encountered during shipping and handling (up to 40°C). 
An in-use stability study was performed on two pilot batches stored at 5±3°C for 24 months and tested 
for a period of 28 days under simulated use conditions. No significant change occurred. The data from 
these studies support an in-use period of up to 4 weeks while stored at 2-25°C. 
Manufacturer B batches 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of finished product, packaged into the proposed 
container and stored in inverted and upright positions for up to 12 months under long term conditions 
and for six months under accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines have been presented.  
The following attributes were assessed: description, pH, osmolality, netarsudil assay and degradation 
products, netarsudil chiral impurity (AR-13323), latanoprost assay and degradation products, 
benzalkonium chloride (preservative content), particulate matter, sterility, antimicrobial effectiveness, 
leachables, and container closure integrity. Only the inverted orientation was tested and reported. 
The results observed for these batches are consistent with the results observed forManufacturer A 
primary stability batches demonstrating equivalent product quality and stability. 
In conclusion, based on the overall stability data, the claimed shelf life of 3 years and storage 
conditions “Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Store in the original carton in order to protect from 
light” is acceptable (SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4). The in-use shelf life and storage conditions for the 
opened bottle “4 weeks after first opening the bottle. Do not store above 25°C”. is also acceptable 
(SmPC section 6.3).

Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in the manufacture of the finished product are of human or animal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The required process validation data has been provided for 
both proposed manufacturers. This multi-dose product is preserved with benzalkonium chloride; the 
proposed formulation fulfils the quality requirements necessary to maintain microbiological quality 
while adequate safety and efficacy profile has been shown from a clinical perspective. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. Three recommendation are proposed having no impact 
on the B/R balance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  Regarding the validation of the methods for assay and related substance applied by 
Manufacturer B, conduct and provide as a minimum, a verification consisting of a linearity test 
for the assay method and at least linearity, LoQ and LoD values for the impurity and residual 
solvents testing methods. The requested data should be provided within one month of the 
CHMP Opinion. 
2.  Provide batch analysis data for residual solvents generated by the finished product 
Manufacturer B (or a contracted laboratory). The requested data should be provided within one 
month of the CHMP Opinion. 
3.  Provide the outcome of the re-evaluation of the latanoprost assay limits at shelf-life as per the 
presented schedule. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical package in support of this application is mainly based on the non-clinical studies 
submitted for registration of the individual component netarsudil and previously assessed in the MAA 
procedure for Rhokiinsa (EMEA/H/C/004583/0000). The Rhokiinsa dossier also contained a few 
netarsudil and latanoprost combination studies that are assessed within this procedure. The 
combination studies include two pharmacology studies in rabbits and Formosan Rock monkeys, one 
tissue distribution study in rabbits and one 3-month ocular repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 21/145 
 
 
 
In addition, the applicant provided a summary of latanoprost characteristics. This is acceptable 
considering the available knowledge on latanoprost. 
Several substances are mentioned within non-clinical section. These include the active substance 
netarsudil mesylate, a metabolite, the R-enantiomer of netarsudil mesylate and the R-enantiomer of 
the metabolite of netarsudil mesylate. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Two pharmacology studies have been conducted with netarsudil and latanoprost in combination to 
evaluate tolerability and efficacy. No pharmacology data for latanoprost, apart from a brief description 
of the MoA, has been presented. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Latanoprost, a prostaglandin F2α analogue, is a selective prostanoid FP receptor agonist which reduces 
the intraocular pressure by stimulation of FP receptors located on ciliary muscle and trabecular 
meshwork cells of the eye that widens the drainage channels (termed the uveoscleral pathway) that 
they form. This increases the outflow of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye 
through Schlemm's canal to outside of the eyeball. The increase in aqueous humour outflow triggered 
by FP receptor activation reduces IOP and underlies the widespread usage of FP receptor agonists to 
treat glaucoma. 
Netarsudil is a potent inhibitor of human ROCK 1 and 2 with Ki values of 1.1 and 1.2 nM, respectively.    
In addition, netarsudil shows potent inhibition on other structurally or functionally related protein 
kinases including protein kinase N2 (Kis 3.0/1.0 nM), protein kinase A (Kis 5.0/1.0 nM) and protein 
kinase MRCK alpha (Kis 129/7.0 nM). 
In cultured porcine and human trabecular meshwork cells, netarsudil disrupted actin stress fibers in 
porcine trabecular meshwork (PTM) cells and focal adhesions in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) 
cells, with PTM/HTM IC50s of 504 nM/219 nM.  
A series of in vivo studies were performed in normotensive pigmented rabbits and monkeys to evaluate 
the ocular pharmacodynamics (IOP) and tolerability of netarsudil at various concentrations. In a 3-day 
rabbit study, netarsudil at 0.005% to 0.04% (1.5 to 12 µg/eye) caused significant and dose-related 
reductions in IOP as compared to the contralateral control eye with a maximal IOP reductions of 
8.1±0.7 mmHg. Similar results were obtained in a 10-day rabbit study, where netarsudil at 0.02% to 
0.04% (6 to 12 µg/eye) caused maximal IOP reductions of 7.1 mmHg, at 4 hours post dose on Day 3. 
In a 3-day study in Formosan Rock monkeys, netarsudil at 0.01% to 0.04% (3 to 12 µg/eye) produced 
significant and dose-related reductions in IOP as compared to the contralateral control eye at all time 
points throughout the study with a maximal IOP reduction of 7.5±1.1 mmHg. These studies indicate 
that netarsudil provides a durable, dose-responsive decrease in IOP when delivered once daily and that 
the IOP response at the end of dosing was typically greater than on the first day.  Trace to mild 
hyperaemia (Draize score +0.5 to +1) was a typical ocular finding in most studies, which decreased 
over time with continued dosing.  
Additional mechanism of action studies indicates that netarsudil may lower IOP through multiple 
mechanisms of action. A study in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that netarsudil lowers IOP by 
increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and decreasing the production of 
aqueous humour. The monkeys were treated for one day with two drops of 0.04% netarsudil 
(20µg/eye, clinical formulation) into one eye and mean IOP was reduced by ~25%, mean outflow 
facility was increased by ~53% and mean aqueous flow rate was reduced by ~20%, when compared

EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 22/145 
 
 
 
to contralateral eye, or baseline. Further, a study in rabbits showed that netarsudil can reduce the 
episcleral venous pressure, an additional mechanism of action expected to contribute to the lowering of 
IOP. The rabbits were treated for three days with one drop of 0.04% netarsudil (12 µg/eye, clinical 
formulation) into one eye and mean IOP was reduced by ~39% and the episcleral venous pressure was 
decreased by ~35%, when compared to contralateral eye. These results are in agreement with findings 
in human eyes (see above). 
Taken together, the main mechanism of action for netarsudil is increased trabecular outflow. The 
studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by reducing episcleral venous pressure. 
The ocular tolerability of 0.02% netarsudil, 0.005% latanoprost and 0.02% netarsudil/0.005% 
latanoprost FDC (denoted PG324 ophthalmic solution) was evaluated in normotensive male Dutch 
Belted rabbits. All three formulations produced trace hyperaemia (Draize score of 0.5) after each daily 
dose, and the hyperaemia resolved by 8 hours post-dose. Other than trace hyperaemia, none of the 
treatment groups evidenced any ocular irritation or significant adverse clinical signs. These results 
indicate the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC was well tolerated and produced no more hyperaemia than 
netarsudil and latanoprost when administered as single components. 
The ocular hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of 0.02% netarsudil, 0.005% latanoprost and 0.02% 
netarsudil/0.005% latanoprost FDC was evaluated in normotensive male Formosan Rock monkeys. 
None of the treatment groups evidenced any ocular irritation or significant adverse clinical signs at the 
dose levels tested in this study. All three formulations produced statistically significant reductions in 
IOP as compared to the contralateral control eye at all post-dose time points during the study. The 
largest reductions in IOP were obtained with netarsudil and the FDC of netarsudil and latanoprost but 
no synergistic effect was evident. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Netarsudil was assessed for its off-target activity on 442 human protein kinases, including ROCK 1 and 
2. At 500 nM (227 ng/mL), significant inhibition (<35% activity) was found on 24 human protein 
kinases in addition to ROCK 1 and 2.  
Furthermore, netarsudil was assessed for its off-target activity on 39 G-protein coupled receptors 
(GPCRs), 4 nuclear hormone receptors, 15 ion channels/transporters and 7 targets of other classes. 
For netarsudil, an activity of >50% inhibition was found on 14 GPCRs, 7 ion channels/transporters, and 
5 cytochrome P450s. One target was the norepinephrine transporter (NET).  
Netarsudilwas shown to induce phospholipidosis in CHO-K1 cells with an EC50 of 1.1 µM (~500 
ng/mL). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that netarsudil also induced the formation of 
lamellar bodies, confirming that the fluorescent phospholipid accumulation in netarsudil treated cells 
was due to phospholipidosis. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In a 7-day rat iv study, no CNS effects were observed after a single or 7 days repeated iv 
administration of netarsudil up to doses of 7.0 mg/kg/day. There were also no signs of CNS effects in 
repeat-dose studies with netarsudil following iv (rat, dog) and topical (rabbit, monkey) ocular 
administration. 
In the hERG potassium channel assay, netarsudil caused a dose-dependent inhibition with an IC50 of 
0.4 μM (~181 ng/mL).

In a dog telemetry study, QTc prolongation was not observed following single iv doses of netarsudil up 
to 17.6 mg/kg (mean plasma concentration 872 ng/mL). Doses at or above 8.8 mg/kg produced 
decreased arterial pressure (by maximum 32%) and increased heart rate (by maximum 124%), with 
clinical signs of vasodilation observed at 17.6 mg/kg. The NOEL for the effects on arterial pressure and 
heart rate was 0.7 mg/kg (mean plasma concentration 27 ng/mL). 
Cardiovascular parameters, including ECGs, were also evaluated in repeat-dose studies following iv 
administration of netarsudil in dogs. In a single dose iv dog study, marked decreases in arterial blood 
pressure were noted at 42 mg/kg (average maximal plasma levels 3980 ng/mL for males and 3260 
ng/mL for females). NOEL for the effects on arterial pressure and heart rate was 21 mg/kg 
corresponding to mean Cmax values of 2280 ng/mL in males and 1620 ng/mL in females. In a 28-day 
repeat-dose dog study, no cardiovascular effects were observed following iv administration of 
netarsudil at up to 0.53-0.67 mg/kg/day. At this dose, the Day 28 average Cmax of netarsudil was 
63.3/51.51 ng/mL in males/females and the average Cmax of AR-13503 was 1.51/1.80 ng/mL in 
males/females. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Based on negligible plasma concentrations of netarsudil detected following topical ocular administration 
in humans, a risk for systemic pharmacodynamic drug interactions is considered minute. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of netarsudil has been evaluated both after ocular and systemic exposure. 
Regarding latanoprost, no ADME information has been provided. One tissue distribution study with 
netarsudil, latanoprost and netarsudil and latanoprost in combination has been conducted. 
Absorption  
After iv administration in rats and dogs, plasma concentrations of netarsudil declined in a monophasic 
manner. Plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) was dose-dependent and approximately dose proportional 
to slightly greater than dose-proportional for netarsudil relative to administered netarsudil mesylate. 
As was the case for topical ocular administration in rabbits and monkeys, there were no gender 
differences relating to the exposure or elimination of netarsudil in rats or dogs.  
In both rabbits and monkeys, plasma levels of netarsudil, AR-13323 and its respective metabolites 
were almost entirely below the quantitation limit at BID doses of up to 0.06% netarsudil in the 1-
month ocular studies. In shorter term studies (7 days) where more concentrated formulations were 
administered up to 4 times daily, systemic concentrations of netarsudil were occasionally observed.  
Distribution 
Netarsudil is highly protein bound in plasma (rat, dog and human). Netarsudil binds melanin with 
similar affinity. 
The systemic tissue distribution study with netarsudil in pigmented rats demonstrated that the tissues 
with the highest percent recovery of administered radioactivity were liver and skin. Elevated 
radioactivity concentrations were observed in melanin-containing tissues, such as the eye uvea, 
pigmented skin, and meninges. The concentration in these tissues did not decline over the study 
period, which suggested an association of 14C-netarsudil-derived radioactivity with melanin. No 
placental transfer studies have been performed with netarsudil.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 24/145 
 
 
 
A tissue distribution study in rabbits following a single ocular dose of 14C-netarsudil, 3H-latanoprost, 
and 14C-netarsudil/3H-latanoprost FDC was performed. For both compounds, the relative tissue 
distributions were the same whether they were administered alone or in combination. The rank order 
of ocular 14C-netarsudil tissue radioactivity concentrations was as follows: 
cornea>conjunctiva>iris/ciliary body>retina-choroid plexus>aqueous humour>vitreous humour>lens. 
The rank order of 3H-latanoprost tissue radioactivity concentrations following ocular administration of 
14C-netarsudil and 3H-latanoprost was cornea>>aqueous humour~iris/ciliary 
body>conjunctiva>retina-choroid plexus>lens~vitreous humour. At tmax, blood and plasma 
radioactivity concentrations were ~2,300- to ~5,000-fold less (14C-netarsudil) and ~850- to ~4,300-
fold less (3H-latanoprost) than the highest ocular tissue (cornea) radioactivity concentration. 
Metabolism  
No substantial metabolism of netarsudil was observed during in vitro exposure to cynomolgus monkey, 
human, rat or dog plasma. In contrast, netarsudil was rapidly metabolised when incubated with rabbit 
plasma. Metabolism was most rapid in dog corneas, followed by monkey corneas, rabbit corneas, pig 
corneas, and human corneas. Overall, the metabolic pathway of netarsudil appears to be common to 
rats, rabbits, dogs, cynomolgus monkeys and humans.  
Excretion  
The primary route of elimination after iv administration of netarsudil was in the faeces with 75.9% of 
the administered dose recovered in the faeces and 14.4 % of the administered dose recovered in the 
urine. Excretion of radioactivity in faeces was rapid; 72.9% of the administered dose was eliminated in 
the initial 48 hours post-dose and only much lower amounts were detected after 72 hours post-dose.  
Following a single ocular dose of 14C-netarsudil in both eyes of rabbits, approximately 80 ± 13.3% of 
the dosed radioactivity was recovered in the excreta by 48 hours post-dose. Percent recovery was ~3-
fold greater from feces than from urine. Approximately 0.11% of radioactivity remained in the liver and 
kidneys and ~0.68% remained in the sum of the ocular tissues by 48 hours post-dose.  
Potential excretion of netarsudil in milk has not been evaluated.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution. 
However, administration of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution to patients in three controlled clinical studies of 
up to 12 months’ duration was not associated with adverse events indicative of an interaction between 
the individual active substances. 
Netarsudil was found to inhibit some cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4) 
at 10 μM concentration and CYP450 2C19 and 2D6 at 0.5 μM. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of netarsudil has been evaluated both after ocular and systemic exposure. The 
pivotal studies for ocular administration were conducted in rabbits (6 months) and monkeys (9 
months), and the systemic exposure in rats and dogs (28 days). The ocular as well as systemic toxicity 
of latanoprost has been investigated in several animal species. One nonclinical toxicology study has 
been conducted with the fixed dose combination product PG324 ophthalmic solution. 
Assessment report

Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies of netarsudil administered i.v. have been performed in rats (1, 3, 45 
mg/kg) and dogs (10, 30, 60 mg/kg). In rats the highest dose was associated with several clinical 
observations such as local irritation at the injection site, reduced activity, hunched posture, and pink 
extremities which was thought to be a pharmacological effect. In the dog, 30 and 60 mg/kg caused 
effects such as reduced activity and eye squinting. The highest dose (60 mg/kg) showed a clinical 
pathology spectrum indicative of an acute anemia (reduced erythrocytes, hemoglobin and 
haematocrit). No information has been provided for latanoprost, which is acceptable given the 
knowledge on this molecule. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Ocular administration of netarsudil in different concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and-0.08%) and 
frequencies (1, 2 and 4 times daily) was investigated in rabbits (7 days, 28 days, 3 months and 6 
months) and monkeys (7 days, 35 days and 9 months). The posology in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity study was one drop in each eye, 0/0.01/0.02/0.04 % twice daily.  
The systemic exposure after topical administration in the eye was very low in both rabbit and 
monkeys. After one drop in each eye of 0.04% netarsudil twice daily it was not possible (with the 
exception of one rabbit at one time point) to detect AR-13324 in the plasma in rabbits treated for 6 
months or in monkeys treated for 9 months.   
In order to evaluate the effects of netarsudil systemically several studies in rats and dogs were 
conducted where netarsudil was administered intravenously. Pivotal studies consisted of 28 days 
treatment with 14 days recovery period with the intended daily doses 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day in 
rats and dogs.   
The ocular as well as systemic toxicity of latanoprost has been investigated in several animal species. 
Generally, latanoprost is well-tolerated with a safety margin between the clinical ocular dose and 
systemic toxicity of at least 1000-fold. High doses of latanoprost, approximately 100-fold the clinical 
dose per kg body weight, administered intravenously to unanaesthetised monkeys have been shown to 
increase the respiration rate probably reflecting bronchoconstriction of short duration. In vivo 
nonclinical safety studies show that latanoprost is non-sensitising. 
In the eye, no toxic effects have been observed with doses of up to 100 micrograms/eye/day in rabbits 
or monkeys (clinical dose is approximately 1.5 microgram/eye/day). In monkeys, however, latanoprost 
has been shown to induce increased pigmentation of the iris. 
In vivo chronic nonclinical ocular toxicity studies show that the administration of latanoprost at 6 
micrograms/eye/day is associated with increased palpebral fissure. This effect is reversible and occurs 
at doses above the clinical dose level. This effect has not been seen in humans. 
The PG324 ophthalmic solution (AR-13324 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) was investigated in a 
repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits in which the animals were administered the combination either 
once or twice daily during 3 months. Ocular irritation was observed in both treatment groups, but the 
combination was otherwise well tolerated by the animals. 
Mortality/morbidity 
Male dogs were euthanised for humane reasons after 3 days of administration with iv netarsudil at 
12.5 mg/kg (2/3 animals) and 25 mg/kg (3/3 animals). At day 3 of dosing the animals were observed

Page 26/145 
 
 
 
with e.g. elevated body temperature, labored breathing, and decreased to no activity.  The clinical 
pathology examination of these animals revealed decreased number of erythrocytes, haemoglobin, 
haematocrit and lymphocytes. The histopathological evaluation revealed granulocytic infiltrations in 
multiple organs. The plasma exposure expressed as AUC0-24h in these animals were at Day 1 3004 
and 7021 ng*h/mL (12.5 and 25 mg/kg). No other mortalities or morbidities were observed in the 
investigated species (rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey). 
Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with the ICH S2(R1) guideline, including tests 
for gene mutations in bacteria and mouse lymphoma cells, and micronuclei in vivo, has been 
performed with netarsudil. All tests were negative. Based on the results of the conducted genotoxicity 
studies, the overall conclusion is that netarsudil does not have any genotoxic potential.  
Latanoprost was found to be negative in reverse mutation tests in bacteria and in the mouse 
lymphoma and mouse micronucleus gene mutation tests. Chromosome aberrations were observed in 
vitro with human lymphocytes. Additional mutagenicity studies evaluating in vitro/in vivo unscheduled 
DNA synthesis in rats were negative and indicated that latanoprost is not a mutagen. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with netarsudil have been conducted. This is acceptable considering the low 
plasma exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, and their metabolites in humans at the anticipated 
clinical dose.  
Latanoprost was found negative in carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. No information was 
however provided on the investigated doses and route of administration. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development  
No studies evaluating the effects on fertility and early embryonic development studies were performed 
with netarsudil. This is acceptable considering the low plasma exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, 
and their metabolites in humans at the anticipated clinical dose. 
The applicant states that latanoprost was not found to have any effect on male or female fertility.  
Embryo-foetal development  
Seven embryo-fœtal development studies (EFD studies) were conducted. Five were dose-range finding 
studies, two were in non-gravid animals (one rat and one rabbit) and three in gravid animals (one rat 
and two rabbit). Two pivotal GLP studies in each of the species rat and rabbit were conducted. None of 
the studies were performed in pigmented animals although it has been shown that netarsudil binds to 
melanin. This is considered acceptable.  
The observed injection site irritation observed in the dose range finding studies led to the decision to 
use animals with implanted vascular access ports in the pivotal study to ensure reliable administration 
in the animals.  
Rats were administered 0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg/day. Rabbits were administered 0, 0.5, 3 and 5 
mg/kg. In both studies a dose dependent increase in the % post implantation loss (from 8.6 to 100% 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 27/145 
 
 
 
in rats and from 1.2% to 12.7% in rabbits. There were no AR-13324 related fetal external, soft tissue, 
or skeletal fetal malformations or variations at any dose.  
In rats, no embryotoxicity was observed at intravenous doses of latanoprost at 5, 50 and 250 
micrograms/kg/day. However, latanoprost induced embryolethal effects in rabbits at doses of 5 
micrograms/kg/day and above.  The dose of 5 micrograms per kg body weight per day (approximately 
100 times the clinical dose) caused significant embryofoetal toxicity characterised by increased 
incidence of late resorption and abortion and by reduced foetal weight. No teratogenic outcomes were 
observed. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function   
No PPND studies were conducted with netarsudil. This is acceptable considering the low plasma 
exposure to netarsudil, its enantiomer, and their metabolites in humans at the anticipated clinical 
dose. 
No information regarding the effect of latanoprost on pre- and postnatal development was provided.  
Juvenile animals  
No studies were performed. The lack of studies in juvenile animals is acceptable considering the 
product-specific waiver for all subsets of paediatric population on the grounds that the specific 
medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for 
paediatric patients. 
Toxicokinetic data 
It has not been possible to detect any systemic exposure of netarsudil in the human patients after the 
intended clinical dose. Thus, it was not possible to calculate an animal:human exposure multiple based 
on AUC. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in the bioanalysis for human samples was 0.1 ng/ml. 
This value was used to compare with Cmax values in animals and to calculate exposure multiples. In 
the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs an exposure multiple of approximately 600-
fold was estimated in both species. In the pivotal embryofetal development studies, comparison with 
Cmax and LLOQ rendered an exposure margin to NOAEL of 40 in rats and 200 in rabbits.  
Another way to estimate the margin for the systemic toxicity is to convert the NOAEL for systemic 
toxicity after systemic administration to the amount of netarsudil mesilate required to achieve the 
human equivalent dose (HED). Accordingly, the NOAEL dose 1 mg/kg/day established in rat and dogs 
was converted to the HED. The HED per day for a 60 kg person is 9.6 mg and 32 mg based on the rat 
and dog data respectively. When netarsudil is administered in both eyes, the daily dose is 0.016 mg. 
Thus, the HED converted from the rat NOAEL was 600-fold, and from the dog 2000-fold the actual 
human dose.  
To compare the topical doses, the doses were normalised to the amount of drug applied in the eyes 
per day. In humans the total dose per day is 16 µg if both eyes are treated. In the pivotal studies in 
rabbits and monkeys the dose ranged from 16 to 64 µg, maximum 4 times the clinical dose calculated 
on daily basis. 
No information regarding toxicokinetics of latanoprost was deemed necessary given the knowledge 
available.

Ocular irritation  
In all studies in rabbit and monkey with ocular administration of netarsudil the signs of irritation such 
as redness of the conjunctiva and/or sclera, chemosis, and discharge were observed. The overall 
incidence and severity appeared to be dose related and transient and decreased during the dosing 
phase and resolved after the recovery phase. In the pivotal 9 months repeat-dose toxicity study in 
monkeys, hyperaemia, chemosis and/or discharge were observed during the first week of dosing. 
There were no signs of ocular irritation after 8 weeks of treatment. Red eyes/sclera was also noted in 
dogs administered netarsudil intravenously, indicating not only irritation but also a pharmacologically 
induced hyperaemia in the eyes.    
Cornea 
In the rabbit degeneration/erosion of the cornea was observed with netarsudil concentrations of 0.04% 
and above. In two of the ocular toxicity studies in monkeys observations of hypertrophy/hyperplasia of 
the corneal epithelium were made. After 7 days treatment of 0.02%, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08% netarsudil 
once or twice daily, subtle hypertrophy/hyperplasia was observed at all dose levels. After 35 days 
treatment, hypertrophy/hyperplasia was only observed in animals exposed to 0.06% twice daily.  
Corneal haze described as diffuse and superficial and with the appearance of multiple, very fine, 
particulate depositions. Corneal haze was observed in monkeys in both the short (7 days) and long-
term studies (9 months). With higher doses, the haze appeared to develop earlier and was more 
pronounced. In the 9-months repeat-dose toxicity study in monkey, the incidence of haze increased 
with higher dose, but not the severity. The haze observed in the 7-day repeat-dose study with a high 
dose of netarsudil (0.12% QID) did not resolve after a period of 7 days without administration of 
netarsudil. In the longer studies where corneal haze was observed after 0.04% netarsudil, the haze 
had resolved after 2-4 treatment free weeks. It seems plausible that the corneal haze is caused by 
phospholipidosis.  
Retina  
Electroretinography was conducted in the studies in monkeys and no treatment related changes were 
observed.  
In one of the non-pivotal studies in monkeys where netarsudil was administered 4 times daily, vitreus 
haze, optic disc hyperaemia with indistinct optic disc margins, and retinal edema were observed in 2 
and 3 animals in the 0.04% and 0.12% groups respectively. The histopathological examination showed 
no inflammation or anatomical alterations.  
Intra ocular pressure   
Netarsudil is indicated for the reduction of elevated intra ocular pressure (IOP). In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies IOP was measured and dose-dependent reduction consistent with the intended 
pharmacology was indeed measured.   
Ocular adnexa  
There were several finding in the ocular adnexa (conjunctivae, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, 
lacrimal gland) after ocular administration of netarsudil in both rabbit and monkey. The primarily 
microscopic finding included cellular infiltrates consistent with and/or related to an inflammatory 
response. Other findings were presence of lymphoid follicles in the palpebral conjunctivae (rabbit) 
hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the conjunctival epithelium (monkey). Lesions in the conjunctiva 
observed after 35 days of treatment in male monkeys did not resolve during 2 weeks recovery period.  
Administration of netarsudil 0.06% BID in female rabbits for 28 days was associated with dark 
appearance of the lacrimal glands. No microscopic correlation was found in this study. However, in 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 29/145 
 
 
 
studies in monkey, microscopic findings such as lymphocytic infiltration, interstitial lymphoid 
aggregates and/or follicles in the lacrimal glands were observed. It is likely that these observations 
correspond to the inflammation seen in the eyelids and nasolacrimal ducts. Injection site  
Intravenous administration of netarsudil caused abnormal appearance and swelling of the injection site 
in rat, rabbit, and dog. In the pivotal study in dog, the severity and incidence were proportional to the 
dose and the reactions recovered during the 2 weeks of non-treatment. To ensure daily 
administrations in the embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, animals with indwelling 
catheters and vascular access ports were used. The cause of these reactions is not fully understood but 
considered acceptable since the route of administration is not used in humans.  
Other organ systems  
Findings in rats and dogs toxicity studies regarding the haematological system were indications of 
anemia but are not considered relevant at the exposures observed after ocular administration.  
From the systemic toxicity studies several sporadic non consistent findings were observed in the liver, 
kidney, pancreas, testes, and epididymides. Since the incidences were low and also included control 
animals, and/or only at clinically non-relevant exposures these findings are of no concern.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  
Netarsudil absorbs light in the lower range of the UV visible spectrum (<330 nm). At the absorbance 
maxima at 288 nm the molar extinction coefficient (MEC) of netarsudil (10914 Lmol-1/cm) was greater 
than the threshold (1000 Lmol-1/cm). To further investigate the phototoxic potential of netarsudil a 
3T3 NRU-PT study was conducted which showed that netarsudil was not phototoxic at the UV spectra 
investigated (UVA, 320-400 nm). 
In a second, modified NRU phototoxicity assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB 
light, netarsudil was found to have a possible phototoxic potential. From a non-clinical perspective, it is 
not possible to elucidate the phototoxicity of netarsudil further and the concern needs to be further 
pursued with clinical data. The potential phototoxicity of AR-13324 and AR-13503 is included in section 
5.3, as follows: “Netarsudil and its active metabolite AR-13503 were found to have a possible 
phototoxic potential in a modified 3T3 NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to 
include UVB light.” 
No information regarding the phototoxic potential of latanoprost was provided. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
For netarsudil, results from experiments to determine the log POW and Log D values were submitted in 
the second round of the procedure. 
The mean log Pow of netarsudil at pH 4.5 was determined to be 2.38 ± 0.03, using the shake flask 
method, and the mean log Pow at pH 7 and pH 9 was determined to be 3.14 ± 0.045 and >4.20 
±0.001, respectively, using the slow stir method. 
At pH 9, no netarsudil mesylate was detected in any aqueous sample. The determined limit of 
detection was used as the aqueous phase value in order to calculate the log Pow at pH 9. This log Pow 
value was determined to be >4.20 ± 0.001 (weighted average of three experiments). The applicant 
noted that the use of the LOD as the value for the aqueous phase may lead to an under estimation of 
the log Pow of netarsudil mesylate at this pH. However, given the mass accountability of the definitive 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 30/145 
 
 
 
samples in combination with previously generated data (Pion Study No. 162927-Rev00), the applicant 
concludes that the weight of evidence supports that the log Pow of netarsudil mesylate at a pH of 9 is 
in the range of 4.2 to 4.5. The log Pow value at pH 9 is considered of less biologically relevance, 
especially considering the large difference between the log Pow values at pH 7 and pH 9, 3.14 vs 
>4.20 and that the log Pow value at pH 7 is not close to the trigger value. Thus, even though the log 
Pow at pH 9 could not be accurately determined it is agreed that no further PBT-assessment is needed. 
The log Kow for latanoprost were 4.22 for pH 5, 4.29 for pH 7, and 4.22 for pH 9. The values are below 
the trigger value for the bioaccumulation criterion (log Kow >4.5). Since log Kow>3, a bioaccumulation 
study would have been triggered if latanoprost had entered a Phase II assessment. 
The PECSURFACE WATER for both netarsudil and latanoprost is concluded to be less than 0.01 µg/L. No 
further analysis is therefore required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In general, the submitted data on the active substance latanoprost is scarce and only include a 
reference to a Summary basis of approval for Xalatan ophthalmic solution, 1996, from FDA. Although 
latanoprost is considered a well-known substance with long clinical experience in the IOP indication, 
the applicant was asked to provide a literature summary of the data forming the basis for the 
information on latanoprost included in SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3. In the response the applicant 
presented the studies included in the FDA Summary Basis of Approval and further stated that no other 
relevant and/or properly controlled (GLP) nonclinical safety studies on latanoprost could be retrieved 
from the publicly available domain. This was considered acceptable, considering the long clinical 
experience of latanoprost and the issue was not further pursued. 
Pharmacology 
Roclanda is a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of two approved ocular hypotensive active 
ingredients, netarsudil at 0.02% and latanoprost at 0.005% and is denoted PG324 ophthalmic solution. 
The concentration of the active ingredients is the same as in currently approved single agent 
ophthalmic solutions; Rhokiinsa and Xalatan. 
Netarsudil is an inhibitor of human ROCK 1 and 2 believed to reduce IOP primarily by increasing the 
outflow of aqueous humour through the trabecular meshwork route while latanoprost is a 
prostaglandin analogue believed to reduce IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour through 
the uveoscleral route. As netarsudil lowers IOP through a different mechanism of action than 
prostaglandin analogues, the FDC combination of netarsudil and latanoprost is expected to work in 
synergy to lower IOP and provide greater efficacy than either monotherapy. 
In a study investigating the ocular hypotensive efficacy of the FDC combination of netarsudil and 
latanoprost, the combination of the substances caused significant reductions in IOP but no greater 
effect than that observed after netarsudil administration only. This study was conducted in 
normotensive male Formosan Rock monkeys. In clinical trials, the average IOP lowering effect of 
netarsudil and latanoprost FDC was greater than monotherapy with either netarsudil 0.02% or 
latanoprost 0.005%. 
The PG324 ophthalmic solution was well tolerated and produced no more hyperaemia than netarsudil 
and latanoprost when administered as single components. Hyperaemia is also reported as a common 
adverse reaction in clinical trials and is likely caused by smooth muscle cell relaxation causing local 
vasodilation.

There is no mention on the secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic 
drug interactions of latanoprost in the submitted non-clinical documentation. Based on the long clinical 
experience with latanoprost in the IOP indication, this is considered acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A tissue distribution study in rabbits following a single ocular dose of 14C-netarsudil, 3H-latanoprost, 
and 14C-netarsudil/3H-latanoprost combination was performed. For both compounds, the relative 
tissue distributions were the same whether they were administered alone or in combination. At tmax, 
blood and plasma radioactivity concentrations were ~2,300- to ~5,000-fold less (14C-netarsudil) and 
~850- to ~4,300-fold less (3H-latanoprost) than the highest ocular tissue (cornea) radioactivity 
concentration. 
Additionally, pharmacokinetic characterisation was supported by a comprehensive testing programme 
carried out as part of the non-clinical development for the individual netarsudil active substance.  
Netarsudil was found to inhibit some cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4) 
at 10 μM concentration (Study AR13324-IPH03), but – based on the very low systemic exposure to 
netarsudil following ocular dosing with netarsudil 0.02% - a risk for systemic drug-drug interactions is 
considered negligible. However, netarsudil concentrations higher than in plasma can be found in the 
ocular tissues, and especially in cornea and conjunctiva which are known to express CYP450 2C19, 
2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzymes. Therefore, the applicant was asked to further discuss if the candidate 
drugs are perpetrators (inhibitors or inducers) or victims for CYP-mediated metabolism and/or 
transporters. A discussion on consequences of drug-drug interactions, especially with other topically 
and concomitantly administered drugs to the eye e.g. antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories, was also 
requested. In their response, the applicant has presented literature data on the lack of DDI potential of 
latanoprost which are considered acceptable (see also clinical section), but no new information on the 
CYP inhibition of netarsudil was provided. As IC50 values were not further determined, it is not 
possible to reason on the likelihood for interaction with cytochrome P450s at ocular exposures in the 
clinical situation. Therefore, the applicant was asked to provide in vitro data for the CYP450 enzyme 
inhibition using lower concentrations of netarsudil (and IC50 values, if possible) and to provide an 
estimation of clinical corneal concentrations of netarsudil. In the response, an estimation of potential 
clinical corneal tissue exposure to netarsudil was presented. The highest mean netarsudil concentration 
in corneal tissue is estimated to a mean Cmax range of 3,807 to 5,697 ng*eq/g. After a second review 
of report AR-13324-IPH03, it is evident that netarsudil was actually tested for CYP inhibition at lower 
concentrations than that stated by the applicant. At 0.5 µM, netarsudil showed a 90% inhibition of 
CYP2C19, and a 74% inhibition of CYP2D6. Thus, the IC50 values are lower than 0.5 µM (≈226 ng/mL). 
Since CYP450 enzymes, and especially CYP450 2C19 and 2D6 are inhibited by ≈226 ng/mL netarsudil, 
and the netarsudil concentrations in cornea are much higher than 200 ng/mL even at 24 or 48 hours 
after the administration, significant CYP450 inhibition can be expected in ocular tissues up to 48 hours 
after Roclanda administration.  
Regarding latanoprost, no ADME information has been provided. As latanoprost is considered a well-
known substance with long clinical experience in the IOP indication, the absence of non-clinical ADME 
data is considered acceptable. 
Toxicology 
Netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution (PG324 ophthalmic solution) contains 
netarsudil and latanoprost as active ingredients in the same concentrations as currently approved 
single agent ophthalmic solutions; Rhokiinsa and Xalatan. Only one new toxicology study has been 
conducted; a 3-months toxicity study in rabbits with ocular administration with the PG324 Ophthalmic 
Solution.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 32/145 
 
 
 
The findings in the study where the PG324 ophthalmic solution was administered in rabbits once or 
twice daily during 3 months were similar as previously observed when netarsudil alone was 
administered. Ocular irritation was observed in both treatment groups.  
The eye drops solution contains 200 µg/mL (0.02 % w/v) benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as a microbial 
preservative and solubilizing agent. Several of the described findings for netarsudil alone are indicative 
of reduced tolerability which could be ascribed to the content of BAK. In Roclanda the BAK content is 
increased compared to the formulation with netarsudil alone (Rhokiinsa contains 0.015% w/w) due to 
low solubility of latanoprost.  In this context, the CHMP has previously acknowledged the applicant’s 
plans to optimise preservative concentrations in both netarsudil monotherapy and fixed dose 
combination (FDC) formulations. 
The main finding after topical administration of netarsudil in the eye in all species was signs of 
irritation. Severity and incidence increased with dose but ocular irritation was also observed in vehicle 
treated animals. In most cases, the irritation declined with time during pursued treatment. These types 
of findings were very common in patients. Conjunctival hyperaemia was reported in 50% of the 
patients. It is recommended to administer Roclanda in the evening which might help the patients to 
tolerate the transient period of irritation.  
In the rabbit degeneration/erosion of the cornea was observed with netarsudil concentrations of 0.04% 
twice daily and above. The overall epithelial layer was thinner but had not progressed to areas 
denuded of corneal epithelium. Histopathological examination showed corneal lesions consisting of 
peripheral vascularisation, mixed cell inflammation and attenuation of the overlying corneal epithelium. 
In the treated patients, a few cases suggestive of corneal erosion were noted. This could be a concern 
in the long-term continuous use in glaucoma. The applicant referred to data on laboratory rabbits 
which shows a high incidence of spontaneous corneal lesions. Furthermore, the animals are exposed to 
multiple ophthalmic tests and repeated topical ocular dosing procedure. The procedures in them self or 
the consequences of, such as decreased blinking could also contribute. In the clinical setting, the 
applicant suggests that the higher incidence eye pruritis and irritation could produce more frequent eye 
rubbing which could explain the higher incidence of punctuate keratopathy. It is not possible to draw 
any conclusions based on non-clinical data regarding the safety in this aspect for a long-term 
continuous treatment of netarsudil.  
In one of the non-pivotal studies in monkeys where netarsudil was administered 4 times daily, vitreous 
haze, optic disc hyperaemia with indistinct optic disc margins, and retinal oedema were observed in 2 
and 3 animals in the 0.04% and 0.12% groups respectively. The histopathological examination showed 
no inflammation or anatomical alterations. The mechanism behind these findings is not fully 
understood. The applicant states that uveal effusion syndrome and hypotony maculopathy are well-
characterised ophthalmic clinical conditions caused by low IOP. This is only partly agreed since uveal 
effusion syndrome is associated with normal or elevated IOP while the hypotony maculopathy is indeed 
caused by low IOP and could be triggered by exaggerated pharmacology when elevated IOP is treated. 
It is not possible to further pursue the question on the mechanism based on non-clinical data. 
Exposure margins regarding netarsudil for systemic toxicity with the negligible systemic exposure in 
the patients can be considered sufficient. For the ocular route and ocular effects the margins are 
substantially lower. In the pivotal animal studies the clinical concentration (0.02%) was investigated 
together with a lower (0.01%) and higher (0.04%) concentration. The margin consisted mainly of the 
fact that the animals were dosed twice daily and humans are dosed once daily. Similar ocular adverse 
reactions were observed in both rabbits and monkeys as well as humans. No information regarding 
toxicokinetics of latanoprost was provided, however, the clinical experience of latanoprost outweighs 
the lack of data.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with the fixed dose combination product 
netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies were 
conducted in support of the original registration applications for netarsudil and latanoprost. 
Information on the individual active substances was provided in lieu of studies with the combination. 
For latanoprost, a summary of clinical pharmacology data reviewed in the Summary Basis of Approval 
documentation for NDA 20597 from the United States Food and Drug Administration was presented 
(FDA 1996). For netarsudil, clinical pharmacology studies AR-13324CS101 and AR-13324-CS102 from 
the original registration application were included in the dossier. 
Absorption  
Netarsudil 
The active substance contained in netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02%, netarsudil mesylate, has 
shown minimal or negligible absorption into the systemic circulation following ocular dosing both in 
nonclinical toxicology studies and in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects (AR-13324-CS101). 
Latanoprost 
In a two-way cross-over study in four healthy male volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a single dose 
of IV (210 μg/ml) and ocular (3 μg/ml) radiolabeled latanoprost was investigated. It was concluded 
that latanoprost and its metabolites were rapidly absorbed following ocular administration with an 
estimated 77% of the dose entering the systemic circulation. 
Distribution 
Netarsudil 
In vitro, netarsudil is highly protein-bound in human plasma. (Study AR-13324-IPK01). 
Latanoprost 
It was found that during intravenous infusion (7.5 min), possibly equating to active compound, binding 
to plasma proteins was approximately 90%. This decreased to about 62% by 2.25 h after the start of 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 38/145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the infusion. After ocular administration a similar pattern was observed to that of intravenous dosing, 
with binding of about 90% at 3 min post-dose decreasing to about 72% at 2 h post-dose. 
Elimination 
Netarsudil  
Netarsudil mesylate, has shown minimal or negligible absorption into the systemic circulation following 
ocular dosing. Preliminary studies investigating the in vitro metabolism of netarsudil have been 
performed using corneal tissue from humans. In addition, in vitro metabolism of netarsudil has been 
investigated in human plasma as well as with human liver microsomes and microsomal S9 fractions. 
These studies demonstrated that metabolism of netarsudil in cornea, liver microsomes and microsomal 
S9 fraction occurs through esterase activity (Study AR-13324-IPK03). Esterase metabolism in human 
plasma was not detected during a 3-hour incubation. 
Latanoprost 
Renal elimination represented the major route of elimination (87.9%) with the remainder recovered in 
faeces (15.3%). In vivo, latanoprost was rapidly hydrolyzed to the biologically active acid PhXA85 which 
had a short half-life of 16.6 min in plasma. The mean Cmax value of the latanoprost acid metabolite 
was 53 pg/ml. Compared to an IV dose, the systemic bioavailability for PhXA85 following ocular 
administration was 45%. PhXA85 was extensively metabolised mainly through β-oxidation. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Netarsudil 
Only one concentration of netarsudil ophthalmic solution was evaluated, 0.02%. Thus, there has been 
no pharmacokinetic evaluation of dose proportionality. There was no evidence for accumulation with 
repeated dosing. 
Latanoprost 
No information was provided on dose proportionality of latanoprost. Plasma concentration of PhXA85 
from patients who had been treated with latanoprost for at least one year showed that there were no 
signs of accumulation of the biologically active acid of latanoprost in plasma. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Netarsudil 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted with netarsudil. Given the very low systemic 
exposure of netarsudil following ocular dosing, it is anticipated that drug-drug interactions will not be a 
concern in the intended patient population. Consistent with the labeling for other ophthalmic products, 
if more than one topical ophthalmic product is to be administered, the products should be administered 
at least 5 minutes apart. 
Latanoprost 
No information was provided. 
Combination product 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 39/145 
 
 
 
With respect to the potential for interaction between the active substances netarsudil and latanoprost, 
the absence of such data is justified with reference to available clinical data for the combination. 
Administration of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution to patients in three controlled clinical studies of up to 12 
months duration was not associated with adverse events indicative of an interaction between the 
individual active substances. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with the fixed dose combination product 
netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution. Clinical pharmacodynamic studies were 
conducted in support of the original registration applications for netarsudil and latanoprost. 
Information on the individual active substances is summarised below in lieu of studies with the 
combination. 
Mechanism of action 
Netarsudil 
In a clinical aqueous humour dynamics (AHD) study in normal volunteers, once-daily dosing of 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% lowered IOP through multiple mechanisms of action as previously 
described in nonclinical studies: increasing trabecular outflow facility, reducing aqueous humour 
production, and decreasing episcleral venous pressure.  
Latanoprost 
The primary mechanism for latanoprost appears to be an increase in aqueous outflow through the 
uveoscleral pathway. 
Combination product 
The different mechanisms of action in the combination product should complement each other and this 
expectation is supported by the statistically significant superiority of the combination relative to its 
components as demonstrated in 1 Phase 2 study and 2 large well-controlled Phase 3 studies (see 
Clinical Efficacy). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Netarsudil 
Study AR-13324-CS201 was a Phase 2, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-
response study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of 3 doses of netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution 0.02% in patients with elevated IOP. There was no apparent difference in IOP 
reduction between AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and Vehicle for 8 hours after the first 
morning dose. The first statistically significant difference in IOP from Vehicle was seen 24 hours after 
the second morning dose. The maximum IOP-lowering effect for netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% 
was observed within approximately 8 hours after the seventh daily dose. This study indicates that it 
may take up to 1 week of dosing before the maximum ocular hypotensive efficacy is achieved in 
patients with elevated IOP. 
Study AR-13324-CS102 was a paired comparison, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 11 healthy 
adult subjects. After unmedicated baseline evaluation of AHD measures, subjects were randomised to 
be dosed with netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% QD (PM) in one eye, and netarsudil ophthalmic

solution Placebo (PM) in the fellow eye for 7 days. They then returned to the Investigator’s office for 
non-invasive measurements of aqueous humour dynamics in each eye. These measures included IOP, 
episcleral venous pressure, tonography, and aqueous flow as determined by fluorophotometry. 
Principal efficacy results: 
• 
The ocular hypotensive effect seen with AR-13324 in this study, a 4.6 mmHg mean decrease 
from baseline (~27%), was highly statistically significant. AR-13324 had the following effects 
on AHD: 
-   Increase in outflow facility (~20% relative to baseline) 
-  Decrease in episcleral venous pressure (~10% relative to baseline) 
-  Decrease in aqueous flow (~15% relative to baseline) 
- 
• 
Increase in uveoscleral outflow (calculated, small relative to baseline) 
Placebo treated eyes showed a small (< 1 mmHg) decrease in IOP, and numerically smaller 
effects on AHD. 
Latanoprost 
No information was provided. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No clinical pharmacology studies were conducted with the fixed dose combination product netarsudil 
0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution. The justification for the lack of clinical 
pharmacology studies with the fixed dose combination product is considered acceptable.  
Based on the low systemic bioavailability of netarsudil following topical dosing (virtually undetectable), 
and on the low systemic bioavailability of latanoprost, it is unlikely that topical ophthalmic application 
of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution would result in any systemic pharmacological effects or 
have potential for systemic drug-drug interactions. Further, administration of the fixed dose 
combination product was not associated with adverse events indicative of an interaction between the 
individual active substances in the three clinical studies.  
The different mechanisms of action in the combination product should complement each other, and this 
expectation is supported by the statistically significant superiority of the combination relative to its 
components as demonstrated in 1 Phase 2 study and 2 large well-controlled Phase 3 studies. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the clinical pharmacology of Roclanda to be sufficiently characterised.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the application for the indication of “reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in 
adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy 
provides insufficient IOP reduction” the applicant has submitted one completed phase 2 and two 
completed phase 3 studies (see table below). A fourth study, a randomised controlled non-inferiority 
study with Ganfort (bitamoprost 0.3mg/ml and timolol 5mg/ml) as the comparator is ongoing.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies  
Study PG324-CS201 is a phase 2 study of 28 days duration, the objectives of which were to:  
• 
• 
evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.01% and 0.02% 
relative to the active components AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution (netarsudil) 0.02% and 
Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005%. 
evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.01% and 0.02%.  
The doses selected for investigation in the study were based on the completed Phase 2 study (AR-
13324-CS202) 
Study population  
The inclusion criteria included the following: 
•  ≥ 18 years old 
•  Diagnosis of open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension 
• 
In the study eye(s), unmedicated (post-washout) IOP ≥ 24 mm Hg at 2 qualification visits 
(08:00 hr), 2-7 days apart. At second qualification visit, IOP ≥ 21 mmHg at 10:00 and 16:00 
hrs in the same eye(s) 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 43/145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Corrected visual acuity in each eye +1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS in each eye (equivalent to 
20/200). 
There were a large number of ocular related exclusion criteria and a smaller number of systemic 
exclusion criteria. 
Ocular related exclusion criteria included: IOP > 36 mm Hg, or use of more than 2* ocular 
hypotensives agents within 30 days of screening; glaucoma with pseudoexfoliation or pigment 
dispersion component, history of angle closure, or narrow angles: previous glaucoma intraocular 
surgery or laser procedures; refractive surgery in study eye(s); ocular trauma within 6 months of 
screening, ocular surgery or laser therapy 3 months prior to screening; evidence of ocular infection, 
inflammation, clinically significant blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or a history of herpes simplex keratitis at 
screening; Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of screening, with the exception of a) ocular 
hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the provided schedule), b) lid scrubs 
(which may be used prior to, but not after screening) or c) lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be 
used throughout the study); Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. corneal edema, uveitis, severe 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca) which might interfere with the study, including glaucomatous damage so 
severe that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one month is not judged safe (e.g., cup-disc 
ratio > 0.8); Central corneal thickness greater than 600 μm; Any abnormality preventing reliable 
applanation tonometry of either eye. 
If the subject qualified in only one eye, then this eye was designated the study eye. If the subject 
qualified in two eyes, then the study eye was the eye with the higher IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3. If 
both eyes have the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3, then the right eye was selected as the study 
eye. In each subject, BOTH eyes were treated. 
Treatments 
The treatments administered were PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.01%, PG324 Ophthalmic Solution l), 
0.02%, AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.02%, or Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.005%. 
The doses selected for the study were based on the results of Phase 2 study (AR-133324-CS202). The 
treatment period of 28 days, was selected on the basis of pre-clinical safety studies which had been 
completed with AR-13324 (netarsudil 0.02%) prior to the commencement of this study and the known 
safety profile of netarsudil.  
All study participants underwent an appropriate washout period of ocular anti-hypotensives. 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean diurnal IOP across subjects within treatment group at Day 
29. Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean IOP across subjects within treatment group at each 
post-treatment time point, mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point, 
mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point, mean diurnal IOP at 
visits other than Day 29, and mean change from the baseline mean diurnal IOP at each visit. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included: percentages of subjects achieving pre-specified percentage 
reductions in IOP from baseline to Day 29 and percentages of subjects attaining prespecified IOP levels 
on Day 29

With a sample size in each group of 70, the study was estimated to have 90.3% power to detect a 
difference between PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.01% or 0.02% and Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 
0.005% and 98.9% power to detect a difference between PG324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.01% or 
0.02% and AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.02% in the mean diurnal IOP on Day 29 assuming a 
mean difference of -1.5 mmHg (to latanoprost) and -2.0 mmHg (to AR-13324), a 1-sided α=0.05, and 
a conservative common SD of 3.0 mmHg.  
Randomisation/Blinding 
Participants were randomised at Visit 3 (which was the 2nd pre-qualification visit during the screening 
procedure). The randomisation schedule was generated by an independent unmasked randomisation 
statistician at SDC following prescribed blocking procedures and methodology for generation of the 
randomisation codes in accordance with standard operating procedure(s). The randomisation 
codes/treatment assignments were generated based on an established schedule: the block size was 4. 
Randomisation was stratified by site. The sponsor, investigator, study statistician and participants were 
blinded to treatment assignment.

Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable was the mean diurnal IOP across subjects at D 29 as evaluated in the ITT 
population. Mean unmedicated diurnal IOP (average of all measurements on Day 1, prior to study 
medication) was 25.1, 25.1, 26.0 and 25.4 in the PG324 0.01%, PG324 0.02%, latanoprost and AR-
13324 0.02% groups, respectively. On Day 29, mean diurnal IOP decreased to 17.3 (-7.8), 16.5 (-
8.6), 18.4 (-7.6), and 19.1 (-6.3) mm Hg, respectively. 
For the primary efficacy variable of mean diurnal IOP at Day 29, PG324 0.02% demonstrated statistical 
superiority to latanoprost and AR-13324 0.02%, (p < 0.0001), as did PG324 0.01% (p = 0.0071 and 
0.0002, for latanoprost and netarsudil 0.02% respectively). 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses: 
Mean diurnal IOP and change from baseline by visit 
Overall mean change from baseline varied slightly by visit but was consistently larger for PG324 0.02% 
then PG324 0.01% and latanoprost in that order. 
Mean diurnal IOP and change from baseline by visit are shown in the following table. On Day 8, mean 
diurnal IOP had decreased to 16.6, 16.0, 18.8, and 18.6 mm Hg in the PG324 0.01%, PG324 0.02%, 
latanoprost and AR-13324 0.02% groups, respectively. On Day 15, mean diurnal IOP was 17.0, 15.9, 
18.7, and 18.8 mm Hg, respectively. On Day 29, mean diurnal IOP was 17.3, 16.5, 18.4, and 19.1 mm 
Hg, respectively. The null hypothesis of the same mean diurnal IOP with PG324 0.02% than with each 
of latanoprost or AR-13324 at Day 29 was rejected (upper limits of a 90% CI: 1.18 and 1.80 mm Hg, 
respectively; p < 0.0001).

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
PG324-CS301 (Mercury 1) and PG324-CS302 (Mercury 2) 
The applicant has submitted two pivotal studies Study PG324-CS301 (Mercury 1) and Study PG324-
CS302 (Mercury 2). Inclusion criteria, objectives and primary endpoint were similar for the two trials. 
Study PG324-CS301 (Mercury 1) A prospective, double-masked, randomized, multi-centre, active 
controlled, parallel-group 12-month study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of 
PG324 Ophthalmic Solution compared to AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution, 0.02% and Latanoprost 
Ophthalmic Solution, 0.005% in subjects with elevated intraocular pressure 
Methods 
Both studies were double-masked, randomised, multicentre, active controlled, parallel group, efficacy 
and safety studies of Roclanda ophthalmic solution compared to each of its active components, 
netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% conducted at 56 sites in the US. Study PG324-CS301 was a 
12 month study with a 2 month extension period. Study PG-324-CS302 had a 3 month duration. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Participants were required to meet all of the following criteria to be entered into the study: 
1.  ≥18 years of age  
2.  Diagnosis of OAG or OHT in both eyes (OAG in one eye and OHT in the fellow eye was 
acceptable) 
3.  Unmedicated (post-washout) IOP >20 mmHg and <36 mmHg in both eyes at 2 qualification 
visits at 08:00 hour, 2-7 days apart. At the second qualification visit, IOP >17 mmHg and <36 
mmHg in both eyes at 10:00 and 16:00 hours. Both eyes had to have qualified at all 
qualification visit time points 
4.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) + 1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS (equivalent to 20/200 or 
better Snellen visual acuity in each eye) 
Exclusion criteria 
The following ophthalmological conditions either at screening or the qualification visit were grounds for

1.  Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g., corneal edema, uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis 
sicca) which might have interfered with interpretation of the study efficacy endpoints or with 
safety assessments, including subjects with glaucomatous damage so severe that washout of 
ocular hypotensive medications (if needed) for 1 month was not judged safe as it would put the 
subject at risk for further vision loss

Treatments 
Study drug was provided in masked subject kits containing identical bottles of IP. There were 3 
treatments in this study: 
•  Netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% (PG324) ophthalmic solution (FDC) 
•  Netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% 
• 
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% 
Subjects were instructed to instil 1 drop of study drug into each eye once per day in the evening 
between 20:00 and 22:00 hours at approximately 24-hour intervals; all treatments were dosed OU.  
For study participants deemed unable to self-administer the doses, a caregiver was asked to 
administer the medication.

Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of this study was to evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of 
netarsudil/latanoprost QD relative to each of its active components, netarsudil 0.02% QD, and 
latanoprost 0.005% QD over a 3-month period.  
The secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of mean, mean change and mean percent 
change from diurnally-adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point; and the mean diurnal, 
mean change and mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit. 
The objectives of the observational extension period to 12 months in Study PG324-CS301 were to 
evaluate the percentage of subjects with IOP values returning to baseline at each time point and ocular 
safety assessments. 
This was a superiority study comparing the fixed dose combination of netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 
0.005% with latanoprost 0.005% and netarsudil 0.02% respectively.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy outcome was the comparison of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 
relative to each of its active components (netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for:  
•  Mean IOP within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at Week 2, Week 6, and 
Month 3 study visits (ITT population) 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the comparison of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 
relative to each of its active components (netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: 
•  Mean IOP within a treatment group at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at each post-treatment visit 
•  Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
•  Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
• 
Percentages of subjects achieving pre-specified levels of mean, mean change, and percent 
mean change in mean diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit

Sample size 
One-hundred ninety six (196) subjects per arm completing 90 days of treatment yielded at least 90% 
power to conclude statistical superiority of netarsudil/latanoprost to latanoprost and > 99% power to 
conclude statistical superiority of netarsudil/latanoprost to netarsudil at all nine time points assuming a 
2-sided alpha = 0.05, a true mean difference of 1.5 mmHg (to latanoprost) and 2.0 mmHg (to 
netarsudil), a common standard deviation of 3.5 mmHg at each time point, and independence among 
time points. Power increased as the correlation among time points increased. Therefore, 196 subjects 
per arm yielded at least 90% power to conclude superiority to both controls over all 9 time points. The 
observed mean differences in IOP in the studies did not greatly deviate from the assumed values used 
in sample size calculation. 
Randomisation and masking 
The randomisation was performed using an IWRS in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive netarsudil/latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution, netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02%, or latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% 
(stratified by investigative site and by maximum baseline IOP [< 25 mmHg versus ≥ 25 mmHg]). A 
randomisation code for allocating the treatments was prepared by an independent biostatistician, who 
was not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study. 
The Investigator, the clinical study team (Aerie, personnel involved in day to day study management, 
Data Managers, and Statisticians), and the subjects were masked to treatment assignments prior to all 
subjects completing 3 months of treatment. When all subjects completed 3 months of treatment, the 
Aerie biostatistical representative unmasked the study to analyse the 3-month efficacy and safety 
data. No other study personnel other than the statistician, SAS programmers, VP Clinical Research and 
Medical Director, Chief Scientific Officer and Information Systems Manager were unmasked to the 
individual subject treatment assignments and demographic information to perform the 3-month 
efficacy and safety data analysis and further exploratory data analysis as necessary. Treatment 
assignment(s) could have been made available to the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
during this period only in case of a medical emergency or occurrence of AEs that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, warranted unmasking. In the absence of a medical need, the randomisation 
code/treatment assignment(s) were not to be available to the above study personnel until after the 
study had completed and the database was locked. No subjects were unmasked during the course of 
this study.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 of the SAP is dated 20 July 2016 and was based on Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 12 April 
2016). It included no changes to the treatment period (Screening through Month 12 visits) analyses 
planned in the protocol. 
A separate SAP was developed for the observational extension period (month 13 and 14 visits) added 
in Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 05 January 2017), and prior to analyses of the data. Version 1.0 of 
this SAP is dated 08 August 2017.   
No changes to the planned analyses detailed in these SAPs were reported by the applicant.

Report Addendum #2 (dated 07 October 2019) 
Analysis Populations 
The randomised population was to include all subjects who were randomised to treatment. Baseline 
variables and demographic characteristics were to be summarised for this population. 
The intention to treat (ITT) population was to include all randomised subjects who received at least 
one dose of study medication. This population was to be the primary population for efficacy analyses 
and was to be used to summarise all efficacy variables. Subjects were to be summarised as 
randomised. 
The per-protocol (PP) population was a subset of the ITT population, which was to include those 
subjects (and their visits) who did not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the 
primary outcome of the study as judged by a masked evaluation prior to the unmasking of the study 
treatment. This population was to be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and was to be 
used to summarise a subset of efficacy variables. If the PP and ITT populations were exactly the same, 
then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population would not have been performed. The PP 
population was to summarise subjects as treated. 
The safety population was to include all randomised subjects who have received at least one dose of 
study medication. This population was to be used to summarise safety variables and was to summarise 
subjects as treated. 
Primary statistical hypotheses 
The primary hypotheses are: 
H01: The difference between study eyes treated with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and study eyes 
treated with latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005% (PG324 - latanoprost), in mean IOP at the 
following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is ≥ 
0 mmHg for at least one time point over all visits. 
H11: The difference between study eyes treated with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and study eyes 
treated with latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005% (PG324 − latanoprost), in mean IOP at the 
following time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is < 
0 mmHg for all time points over all visits. 
H02: The difference between study eyes treated with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and study eyes 
treated with Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% (PG324 − Netarsudil), in mean IOP at the following 
time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is ≥ 0 mmHg 
for at least one time point over all visits. 
H12: The difference between study eyes treated with PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and study eyes 
treated with Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% (PG324 − Netarsudil), in mean IOP at the following 
time points: 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 Visits, is < 0 mmHg 
for all time points over all visits. 
The study will be considered a success if both H01 and H02 are rejected. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy outcome was the comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative to each of its 
active components (Netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 52/145 
 
 
 
Mean IOP within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and 
Month 3 study visits. 
The primary analysis of the primary outcome was to employ a linear model with mean IOP at the given 
visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and time point (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) as the response 
variable, baseline IOP at the corresponding timepoint as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect 
factor, using the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniques (Monte Carlo Markov 
Chain using EM algorithm) used to impute missing data.  
Separate imputation models including baseline IOP measurement and treatment assignment were to 
be fit for each time point at each visit. 5 imputed datasets were to be created for each visit and 
timepoint. Rubin’s rules were to be used for inference. 
The least squares mean differences (PG324 – comparator) between PG324 Ophthalmic Solution and 
each of Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution 0.005% and Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% were to 
be tested. The 2-sided p-values and associated 95% confidence intervals were to be presented. 
The primary efficacy analysis was to be repeated on the ITT population using observed data only 
(complete case analysis), last observation carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF was to be performed 
using time-relevant measures; and baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) using time-relevant 
measures, to determine the robustness of results. Additionally, the above analyses were to be 
repeated on the PP population to determine robustness of results. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the comparison of PG324 Ophthalmic Solution relative to each of 
its active components (Netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: 
•  Mean IOP within a treatment group at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean diurnal IOP within a treatment group at each post-treatment visit (average of the 08:00, 
10:00 and 16:00 measurements) 
•  Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
•  Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point 
•  Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP at each post-treatment visit 
• 
Percentages of subjects achieving pre-specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change diurnal IOP levels at each post-treatment time point: 
•  Diurnal mean IOP of ≤22, ≤21, ≤20, ≤19, ≤18, ≤17, ≤16, ≤15, ≤14 
• 
IOP reduction from baseline of ≥2, ≥4, ≥6, ≥8, ≥10, ≥12 (IOP reduction at a visit from 
baseline was calculated as IOP [baseline] - IOP [visit], using mean [integral or non-integral] 
IOP values) 
• 
IOP percent reduction from baseline of ≥5, ≥10, ≥15, ≥20, ≥25, ≥30, ≥35, ≥40 (IOP percent 
reduction at a visit from baseline was calculated as [IOP reduction from baseline / IOP 
(baseline)] * 100%) 
All primary and secondary efficacy variables, along with the planned analysis methods for those 
variables, are given in the table below. These analyses were to be performed for the ITT population for 
all efficacy variables and PP population for selected efficacy variables. The ITT population was to be 
used for all efficacy subgroup analyses. Only study eyes were to be evaluated for all of the efficacy 
measures; however, both eyes were to be treated. Fellow eyes were to be evaluated separately for the 
primary analysis of the primary efficacy measure.

2. Subject 219-004 was randomised to netarsudil/latanoprost QD but the subject received latanoprost (Listing 
16.1.7), resulting in one less subject in the netarsudil/latanoprost safety population and one more subject in the 
latanoprost safety population, compared to the respective ITT populations.

The demographic characteristics were similar across all 3 treatment groups for the 718 participants. 
There were more females (56.5%) than males (43.5%) randomised to the study, and the majority of 
subjects were White (67.7%), greater than 65 years of age (56.7%) with an iris color of brown/black 
(60.2%).

The majority of subjects across all treatment groups were diagnosed with OAG (75.3%). 
Approximately 3/4 of the participants were on prior ocular hypotensive treatment, meaning 25% were 
untreated which might imply that they were a newly diagnosed population. Between 9.7% and 13% 
had been treated with combination therapy and just over half had prior prostaglandin therapy.  
In the study eye, the mean IOP at screening was 19.5, 19.5, and 19.3 mmHg in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost treatment groups, respectively, and the 
unmedicated mean diurnal IOP (average of all measurements on Day 1, prior to first dose of study 
medication) was 23.7, 23.6, and 23.5 mmHg in the netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost 
treatment groups, respectively. Mean time since diagnosis was longer for the combination therapy arm 
(403 weeks compared to 335 and 336 weeks for netarsudil and latanoprost respectively. None of the 
baseline characteristics were statistically significantly different between treatment groups.

Study PG324-CS-302 
The demographic characteristics were similar across all 3 treatment groups for the 750 subjects. There 
were more females (59.9%) than males (40.1%) randomised to the study for all 3 treatment groups, 
and the majority of subjects were White (65.2%), greater than 65 years old (54.8%) with a 
predominant iris colour of brown/black (70.8%). Approximately 30% of the study population were 
Black or African American. 
The majority of subjects were diagnosed with OAG (70.7%). Approximately two thirds of the subjects 
were on prior hypotensive therapy, somewhat lower than the proportion in Study PG324-CS301, with 
broadly similar proportions in this study treated with combination therapy as in Study PG324-CS301 . 
In the study eye, the mean IOP at screening was 19.7, 20.5 and 19.7 mmHg in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost treatment groups, respectively, and the un-
medicated mean diurnal IOP (average of all measurements on Day 1, prior to study medication) was 
23.5, 23.6 and 23.5 mmHg in the netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost treatment groups, 
respectively.

The PP dataset included 671 subjects. A total of 28, 27, and 24 subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost, 
netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively, were excluded from the PP analysis set due to 
protocol deviations as per the SAP.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study PG324-CS301 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 
relative to each of its active components (netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%) for: Mean IOP 
within a treatment group at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours at the Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 study 
visits (ITT population). The analysis of the primary outcome used an ANCOVA model with mean IOP at 
the given visit and time point as the response, baseline IOP as the covariate, treatment as main effect 
factor using the ITT population with multiple imputation for missing data using MonteCarlo Markov 
Chain modelling 
At all 9 time points baseline adjusted IOP was lower for the combination therapy than either netarsudil 
or latanoprost monotherapy. The LS mean IOP ranged from 14.8 to 16.3 mmHg for study eyes treated 
with netarsudil/latanoprost, 17.2 to 19.0 mmHg for netarsudil, and 16.7 to 17.8 mmHg for latanoprost 
across all 9 time points through Month 3. IOPs in the netarsudil/latanoprost treatment group were 
lower than those in the netarsudil group by -1.8 to -3.0 mmHg and the latanoprost group by -1.3 to -
2.6 mmHg across the 9 time points up. The analysis demonstrated statistical superiority of the 
combination relative to both of its individual components in the ITT population at all 9 time points from 
Week 2 through Month 3 (p < 0.0001).

Secondary endpoints 
Study PG324 CS-301 
To determine the robustness of the results a number of sensitivity analyses were carried out. The 
primary endpoint was analysed in the PP population with ANCOVA modelling and MCMC, with broadly 
similar results. The LS mean IOP ranged from 14.9 to 16.3 mmHg for study eyes treated with 
netarsudil/latanoprost, 17.3 to 19.1 mmHg for netarsudil, and 16.7 to 17.9 mmHg for latanoprost. The 
range of LS mean IOP in the netarsudil/latanoprost group was lower than that of the netarsudil group 
by -1.8 to -3.0 mmHg and lower than in the latanoprost group by -1.2 to -2.5 mmHg across the 9 time 
points. In all cases, the differences in the LS mean IOP between netarsudil/latanoprost and either of its 
individual active components were statistically significant (p < 0.001). 
The primary efficacy analysis was repeated in the ITT and PP populations using observed data only, 
LOCF and BOCF. The analysis was also repeated in the ITT population using MMRM and observed data. 
Netarsudil/latanoprost was statistically significantly superior to each of its active components at all 9 
time points for the secondary efficacy analysis using the primary analysis model(ANCOVA) without data 
imputation (observed data only) and using LOCF, but not when using BOCF.

Sensitivity analyses 
An analysis of the primary endpoint was also carried out in the PP population using the ANCOVA model 
with MCMC. The LS mean IOP ranged from 15.3 to 16.6 mmHg for study eyes treated with 
netarsudil/latanoprost, 17.5 to 19.8 mmHg for netarsudil, and 17.0 to 17.9 mmHg for latanoprost. 
Netarsudil/latanoprost LS mean IOP was lower than that of netarsudil by -2.2 to -3.3 mmHg and 
latanoprost by -1.3 to -2.2 mmHg across the 9 time points. The differences in the least squares mean 
IOP were statistically significant (p < 0.0001) at all time points. 
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed in the ITT and PP populations. The combination 
treatment was statistically significantly superior to each of its active components at all time points 
using different imputation methods for missing data (LOCF, BOCF, and observed data only)..

elevated intraocular pressure 
Study identifier 
Protocol number: PG324-CS301 
NCT number: NCT02558400 
Design 
A 12-month, double-masked, randomized, multicentre, active-controlled, parallel-
group safety and efficacy trial.  Adult subjects (18 years and older) with open-
angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) were randomized 1:1:1 to 
either a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of netarsudil/latanoprost (0.02%/0.005%) 
ophthalmic solution, netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution monotherapy or 
latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution monotherapy all dosed once-daily (QD) in 
the evening (PM) consecutively for 12 months.  Primary efficacy variable was mean 
intraocular pressure (IOP) at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours at each of the Week 2, 
Week 6 and Month 3 visits, measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry.  The 
study was powered to conclude statistical superiority of the FDC to each of the 
active components dosed as monotherapies with a target sample size of 230 
subjects to be enrolled per arm to yield at least 196 subjects per arm completing 3 
months of treatment.

Table 17. Summary of efficacy for trial PG324-CS302 MECURY 2 
Title:  
A prospective, double-masked, randomized, multi-center, active controlled, parallel-group, 
3-month study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of PG324 Ophthalmic 
Solution compared to AR-13324 Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and Latanoprost Ophthalmic 
Solution 0.005% in subjects with elevated intraocular pressure 
Study identifier 
Protocol number: PG324-CS302 
NCT Number: NCT02674854 
Design 
A 3-month, double-masked, randomized, multicentre, active-controlled, 
parallel-group safety and efficacy trial.  Adult subjects (18 years and 
older, or ≥19 years in Canada) with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OHT) were randomized 1:1:1 to either a fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) of netarsudil/latanoprost (0.02%/0.005%) ophthalmic 
solution, netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution monotherapy or 
latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution monotherapy all dosed once-daily 
(QD) in the evening (PM) consecutively for 3 months.  Primary efficacy 
variable was mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 
hours at each of the Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3 visits, measured by 
Goldmann applanation tonometry.  The study was powered to conclude 
statistical superiority of the FDC to each of the active components dosed 
as monotherapies with a target sample size of 230 subjects to be enrolled 
per arm to yield at least 196 subjects per arm completing 3 months of 
treatment. 
Duration of main phase:   
3 months 
Duration of Run-in phase:   
Duration of Extension phase: 
Not Applicable; subjects on prior therapy 
had to wash-out of their previous 
treatment for 5 days to 4 weeks according

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant has submitted post hoc pooled data from the two phase 3 studies (PG324-CS301 and 
PG324-CS302. The objective of this ad hoc report is to investigate the efficacy of 
netarsudil/latanoprost in defined subgroups of the treated populations included in the two Phase 3 
studies that are considered to align with the target population for Europe (i.e. OAG and OHT patients 
requiring combination therapy), based on current European treatment guidelines (EGS 2014) and 
scientific advice received from the European Medicines Agency 
(EMEA/H/SA/3386/1/FU/2/2019/SME/III).  
The applicant has presented data on the ocular hypotensive efficacy of netarsudil/latanoprost 
compared to netarsudil and latanoprost in the following subgroups of patients included in the 
previously conducted Phase 3 studies: 
1.  All subjects previously-treated with a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) in combination with 
another IOP-lowering medication; 
2.  All subjects on PGA monotherapy at the time of screening with screening IOPs ≥19 mmHg, 
≥22 mmHg and ≥24 mmHg, as recommended by the Agency. (Subgroups with screening IOPs 
≥18 mmHg, ≥20 mmHg, ≥21 mmHg, or ≥23 mmHg were also evaluated). 
3.  To investigate the efficacy of netarsudil/latanoprost in patients diagnosed with OHT considered 
at “high risk” of potential conversion to glaucoma, the report also presents efficacy results for: 
all subjects diagnosed with OHT who had baseline (post-washout) IOPs in the study eye >24 
or >26 mmHg. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint, study-eye IOP, was primarily analysed on the intent to-treat (ITT) 
analysis population using baseline-adjusted analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs), with missing data 
multiply-imputed using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach. Separate models were fit for 
each visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and time point (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours). Secondary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint consisted of two-sample t-tests. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included in the mean diurnal IOP; mean change from diurnally 
adjusted baseline IOP; mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP; percentages of subjects achieving 
pre-specified mean, mean change, and percent mean change in diurnal IOP levels. 
Results 
All subjects treated with a combination therapy containing a prostaglandin analogue. 
In the primary efficacy analysis (Table 18), Netarsudil/Latanoprost achieved lower LS mean IOP than 
latanoprost, with the difference ranging from -0.75 to -3.91 mmHg in favour of netarsudil/latanoprost. 
The difference between netarsudil/latanoprost and latanoprost reached statistical significance at 7 out 
of 9 time points. The overall statistical testing is difficult to interpret due to the relatively small sample 
size (see table below). The combination therapy achieved reductions in IOP compared to netarsudil 
ranging from -1.9 to -4.4mmHg which were statistically significant at all time points.

PGA monotherapy 
For participants with screening IOP ≥ 19mmHg (i.e. treated IOP) and on PGA monotherapy the 
combination therapy demonstrated superiority in lowering IOP at all time points compared to the 
individual monotherapies. This was not the case for the population with screening IOP ≥22 mmHg, 
where the combination only showed superiority at all 9 time points to netarsudil. The combination 
achieved lower LS mean IOP than latanoprost, with the difference ranging from -0.1 to -1.9 mmHg in 
favour of the combination but only reached statistical significance at only 1 out of 9 time points (Day 
15, at 4PM). The statistical testing is difficult to interpret due to the smaller sample size (n =34 PG324, 
n = 39 netarsudil and n = 31 latanoprost) 
Patients with high risk OHT 
The subgroup of subjects from the pooled PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302 studies with a diagnosis 
OHT and baseline IOP >24 mmHg included a total of 178 subjects, and the subgroup with baseline 
pressures >26mmHg included a total of 100 subjects. 
For OHT subjects with screening IOP >24 mmHg, netarsudil/latanoprost demonstrated superiority to 
netarsudil in lowering IOP at 9 out of 9 time points, with the difference in LS mean IOP ranging from -
2.2 to -4.1 mmHg. Netarsudil/latanoprost demonstrated superiority to latanoprost at 8 out of 9 time 
points, with the difference in LS mean IOP ranging from -1.2 to -2.7 mmHg.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the application, the applicant has submitted one phase 2 randomised controlled and two 
phase 3 randomised controlled studies. All studies were conducted in populations with a diagnosis of 
primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
The applicant is conducting a phase 3 RCT that has not yet been completed with the objective of 
showing non-inferiority to Ganfort (combination of bitamoprost and timolol). The phase 2 study could 
be defined as a dose finding study. All submitted studies were conducted in the US. The on-going non-
inferiority study is being conducted in Europe. 
The phase 2 study was 29 days in duration and assessed mean diurnal IOP at D 29 compared to 
baseline as the primary endpoint, with change in mean IOP from baseline IOP at 3 time points on Days 
8, 15 and 29 as the main secondary endpoint. Two different strengths (0.01% and 0.02%) of the 
netarsudil/latanoprost combination were compared with netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%.  
Overall, in the phase 2 study, approximately 44% of the patient population had a diagnosis of ocular 
hypertension and 56% of primary open angle glaucoma. Seventy- six percent of study participants had 
a history of prior use of ocular hypotensive medication. 
The phase 3 studies had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to each other but different durations (12 
months for PG324-CS301, with an optional further 2-month observation period, and 3 months for 
PG324-CS301). However, the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at the same time point for both 
i.e. at D 90. 
The phase 3 studies included a wide range of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. All 
participants were required to have a diagnosis of OAG or OHT in both eyes (OAG in one eye and OHT in 
the fellow eye was acceptable) and an un-medicated (post-washout) IOP >20 mmHg and <36 mmHg 
in both eyes at 2 qualification visits at 08:00 hour, 2-7 days apart. At the second qualification visit, IOP 
>17 mmHg and <36 mmHg in both eyes at 10:00 and 16:00 hours. Both eyes had to have qualified at 
all qualification visit time points. 
However, a number of participants had no history of prior therapy and may have been newly 
diagnosed patients. In Study PG324-CS301 25% had no prior therapy and in PG324 CS302, 35% had 
no prior therapy.   
Therefore, it could be said that the population studied are not very representative of the population for 
whom the indication is sought. To address this issue, the applicant had sought – before the evaluation 
procedure - scientific advice from the EMA and was advised, to conduct a range of post hoc analysis, to 
provide further evidence for efficacy in this population.  
The comparators used in the phase 3 studies i.e. netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% are 
appropriate as they are the mono-components of the combination therapy. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 80/145 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was similar in both phase 3 studies, (a comparison of reduction in IOP 
from baseline at nine time points over the course of the study in the combination treatment arm 
versus the netarsudil 0.02% arm and latanoprost 0.005%). Evaluation of the primary endpoint was 
conducted in the modified ITT population with missing data imputed using the MCMC multiple 
imputation approach. A number of sensitivity analyses of the endpoint were conducted in the ITT and 
PP populations.  Reduction in IOP is accepted as a valid biomarker in glaucoma studies, given that 
there is evidence that IOP reduction is associated with delayed progression of open angle glaucoma 
and progression of OHT to OAG. Changes in visual fields were evaluated as a safety endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The phase 11 study compared two strengths of PG324 (PG3240.01%, PG324 and PG3240.02%) to 
netarsudil and latanoprost. Mean diurnal IOP adjusted for baseline at D 29 in those treated with PG324 
0.02% and PG324 0.01% was lower than for either monotherapy comparator (primary endpoint). The 
reduction in IOP compared to both netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost was statistically significant for 
both combination agents. The PG324 0.02% strength appears to have been chosen for the phase 3 
trials on the basis that reductions in mean diurnal IOP at D 8, 15 and 29 were numerically greater for 
PG324 0.02% than for PG324 0.01%. In addition, at eight of nine time points evaluated reductions in 
IOP compared to latanoprost were numerically greater for PG324 0.02% than PG324 0.01%.  
Both phase 3 studies showed a statistically significant difference in IOP lowering from baseline at all 9 
time points evaluated, to both netarsudil and latanoprost monotherapy in the modified ITT population 
(all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication). In the case of both 
phase 3 studies, this was the same as the randomised population. 
In PG324-CS301 reductions in baseline for the combination therapy compared to netarsudil ranged 
from -3.6 to -1.79 mmHg, and for latanoprost from-3.18 to -1.26mmHg.  
In PG324-CS302 reductions from baseline for the combination therapy compared to netarsudil ranged 
from -3.31 to -2.16 mmHg and for latanoprost from -2.01 to -1.47mmHg. In both pivotal studies, the 
treatment differences were statistically significant at all time points.  
Treatment discontinuation rates for the netarsudil and combination arms were higher in PG324-CS301 
compared to latanoprost at both 3 and 12 months. At 3 months, 15.5% in the combination arm and 
15.6% in the netarsudil arm had discontinued continued from the study compared to 5.5% from the 
latanoprost arm. The difference in discontinuation rates were not as marked in PG324-CS302 (8.8% 
combination therapy, 10.6% netarsudil and 5.6% latanoprost). 
Sensitivity analyses conducted on the primary endpoint for CSPG324-302 in the ITT and PP populations 
using LOCF and BOCF to impute missing data as well as observed data, and MMRM, showed a 
statistically significant difference at all time points for the combination therapy compared to netarsudil 
and latanoprost.  However, for PG324-CS301 statistical significance in favour of the combination 
therapy was maintained in all of the sensitivity analyses, with the exception of BOCF. In this study 
which had a higher discontinuation rate in the combination arm compared to latanoprost, it is possible 
that imputation methods such as MCMC and LOCF could have exaggerated the benefits of the 
combination therapy versus latanoprost particularly as the missing data due to differential 
discontinuation rates is unlikely to be missing at random. On the other-hand imputation using BOCF, 
given the higher discontinuation rates for the combination therapy compared to latanoprost is likely to 
be overly conservative. In response to a request from the assessors, further sensitivity analysis of both 
pivotal studies demonstrated that the primary efficacy endpoint continued to meet criteria for success 
within the ITT population at all 9 of 9 time points from Week 2 through Month 3 in both phase 3 
studies.

Treatment differences at all time-points (primary endpoint) for the combination therapy compared to 
latanoprost were at least more than 1mmHg in both studies. This is considered a clinically relevant 
difference. In the Early Manifest Glaucoma trial, each 1mm Hg additional reduction in IOP reduces the 
risk of progression decreased by 10% for every 1mmHg reduction in IOP1.  
The initial indication sought by the applicant is for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) 
in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy 
provides insufficient IOP reduction. The sought indication was considered too broad. Superiority of 
Roclanda was only demonstrated against latanoprost and netarsudil monotherapies or at most against 
a prostaglandin analogue and rho kinase inhibitor class of medicinal product. 
In addition, the population requiring combination therapy were under-represented in the phase 3 
studies. Following scientific advice from CHMP the applicant undertook a number of post hoc sub-group 
analyses in the pooled Phase 3 studies.  
In a pooled analysis of combination therapy compared to netarsudil and latanoprost in a population 
previously treated with a combination therapy containing a prostaglandin analogue PG324 achieved 
lower LS mean IOP than latanoprost, with the difference ranging from -0.75 to -3.91 mmHg in favour 
of PG324. The difference between netarsudil/latanoprost and latanoprost reached nominal statistical 
significance at 7 out of 9 time points. Further sensitivity analysis using LOCF and BOCF in this 
population (D120 MO Q 72 (d)) showed a slight  attenuation in effect in the LOCF population with 
treatment difference compared to latanoprost at least 1mmHg at 8 of 9 time points (all of which were 
statistically significant). As expected there was a greater attenuation in the BOCF population, however 
the treatment difference compared to latanoprost was a greater than 1 mmHg at 7 of 9 time points 
(statistical significance was achieved at 5 of 9 time points). 
In a categorical analysis, 39.5% of those treated with combination therapy achieved a reduction from 
baseline of ≥ 8mmHg, compared to 18.2% for netarsudil, and 18% for latanoprost. Forty-eight point 
eight percent in the combination therapy arm achieved a reduction from baseline IOP of ≥ 30%, 
compared to 20% for netarsudil and 23.1% for latanoprost. Almost 56% in the combination group 
achieved a target IOP of ≤ 17mmHg compared to 25.5% for netarsudil and 30.8% for latanoprost. 
Analysis of the subgroup with ocular hypertension and a screening IOP > 26mmHg also showed 
nominally statistically significant benefit over netarsudil at all 9 time points and over latanoprost at 8 
of 9 time points.  
Given the  findings in the initial subgroup analysis of those previously treated with a prostaglandin 
containing combination therapy along with the further sensitivity analysis, it is considered that the 
applicant has provided sufficient data to support the indication in the population most likely to require 
treatment with more than one IOP lowering therapy. 
In response to Questions from the CHMP, the applicant proposed to amend the indication as follows: 
“Roclanda is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular (IOP) pressure in adult patients with 
primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy with a prostaglandin or a 
rho kinase inhibitor provides insufficient IOP reduction”. 
To support the amended indication the applicant has provided data from the literature that shows 
broadly similar efficacy across the class of prostaglandin analogues and a post hoc analysis showing 
better control of IOP with Roclanda in patients previously treated with a PGA combination therapy prior 
to the study. Based on this evidence the indication could be widened to include those with failure of 
any prostaglandin therapy. At present only one rho kinase inhibitor is authorised in the EU therefore no 
judgements can be made regarding any future rho kinase inhibitor and rho kinase class as a whole, 
therefore the CHMP requested the applicant to justify the inclusion of rho kinase inhibitors as a class.  
In response, the applicant proposed a modified indication which is considered acceptable:  
Assessment report

Roclanda is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular (IOP) pressure in adult patients with 
primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy with a prostaglandin or 
netasurdil provides insufficient IOP reduction”. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considers the efficacy of Roclanda to have been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution builds upon the previous assessment of the 
ocular and systemic safety of the new active substance for the single-constituent netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution 0.02% approved as part of the initial MAA for Rhokiinsa (Procedure number EMEA/H/C/4583) 
approved in the EU in 2019. 
The Phase 2 study for netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution (PG324-CS201) was 28 days in 
duration and compared the ocular hypotensive efficacy and ocular and systemic safety of netarsudil

The two Phase 3 studies (PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302) were conducted to evaluate the ocular 
hypotensive efficacy and ocular and systemic safety of netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02% as compared with 
netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%.  Study PG324-CS301 was 12 months in duration, while 
study PG324-CS302 was 3 months in duration.  The dosing regimen in each study was 1 drop 
administered QD in the evening.

The medical and ophthalmic history and concomitant medications profile for the subjects in all 3 
completed clinical studies were similar to those typically observed in OAG and OHT studies evaluating 
pharmacotherapies, and as expected for the intended patient population.  
Frequently reported ocular diseases/conditions (≥ 10% incidence) were similar between studies and 
included cataract, dry eye, pinguecula (less frequently reported in the Phase 3 studies than in the 
Phase 2 study), vitreous detachment, and vitreous floaters (less frequently reported in the Phase 3 
studies than in the Phase 2 study).  
Frequently reported non-ocular diseases/conditions (≥ 10% incidence) were similar across studies and 
treatment groups. The most commonly reported conditions were hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 87/145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the pooled population, the most common ocular disorders and surgical procedures reported in 
≥10% of subjects included the following: cataract, dry eye, vitreous detachment, conjunctival 
hyperaemia, pinguecula, eyelid dermatochalasis, cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation.  
The most common systemic conditions and surgical procedures reported in ≥10% of subjects in the 
pooled population included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
osteoarthritis, arthritis, drug hypersensitivity, seasonal allergy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post-
menopause, depression, hypothyroidism and hysterectomy.  
Overall the ocular and non-ocular conditions reported in these studies are common in an aging 
population, and no clinically relevant differences in baseline diseases/conditions were observed 
between treatment groups across all studies. 
As shown in the table below, the most frequently reported concomitant medications (≥ 20% incidence) 
were similar across all studies and included the following: HMG CoA Reductase inhibitors, platelet 
aggregation inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, multivitamins, biguanides, Vitamin D and analogues, and proton 
pump inhibitors. These drug classes include medications commonly used by an aging population and 
are consistent with the baseline diseases/conditions reported in the studies. Overall, no clinically 
relevant differences in baseline systemic concomitant medication classes were observed between the 
treatment groups across all studies. 
Prior or concomitant non-ocular medications were used by 93.5% of the pooled population with the 
most common (≥10% of subjects) including atorvastatin, simvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), 
lisinopril, metformin, omeprazole, amlodipine, and multivitamins. Prior or concomitant ocular 
medications were used by 78.4% of the pooled population, with latanoprost (28.3%) being the most 
widely used ocular hypotensive medication prior to study.

Subject Disposition 
In the Phase 2 study, nearly all of the 298 subjects randomised in the study completed study 
participation, with only 6 subjects discontinuing early, 3 of whom discontinued due to AEs (Table 28).   
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 88/145 
 
 
 
 
 
The Phase 3 studies, which were of significantly longer duration than the Phase 2 study, had higher 
rates of subject discontinuation as might be expected.  In PG324-CS302 (90-day duration), 8.7% of 
subjects (n = 65) discontinued prior to study completion and discontinuation due to AE(s) occurred in 
6.9% (n = 17), 5.9% (n = 15) and 2.0% (n = 5) of the netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and 
latanoprost groups, respectively.   
In PG324-CS301 (365 day duration), 29% of subjects (n = 208) discontinued prior to study completion 
and discontinuations due to AE(s) occurred in 19.7% (n = 47), 21.7% (n = 53), and 1.7% (n = 4) of 
subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively (Table 28).  
In the pooled population, 1195 (81.4%) subjects completed study participation, with a total of 273 
subjects (18.6%) being discontinued from the study. Adverse event was the primary reason for subject 
discontinuation (9.6%), followed by withdrawal of consent (2.7%). Overall, more subjects discontinued 
in the netarsudil/latanoprost (21.6%) and the netarsudil (24.3%) groups, compared to the latanoprost 
group (9.8%). More subjects discontinued due to an AE in the netarsudil/latanoprost (13.5%) and 
netarsudil (13.5%) groups than in the latanoprost (1.8%) group.

Adverse events 
Note on Benzalkonium chloride (BAK): 
As discussed in the Quality AR, and as outlined in the risk management plan, discussion around the 
preservative component of the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution was raised during the 
procedure. 
In general, it is acknowledged in the netarsudil RMP that the application of any ocular treatment/eye 
drop containing preservatives may result in possible ocular adverse effects. This risk is considered a 
routine risk for many ocular treatments involving preservative-containing eye drops.  The preservative 
content in the single constituent netarsudil ophthalmic solution is 0.015% benzalkonium chloride 
(BAK), which is a lower concentration of preservative than is present in the most widely prescribed 
glaucoma product, latanoprost ophthalmic solution (with 0.02% BAK).  The preservative content of 
netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02%/0.005% ophthalmic solution is 0.02% BAK, which is no higher than 
currently approved latanoprost ophthalmic solution.   
Patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension are usually required to use eye drops for 
life. The presence of a preservative in an ocular medication has often been considered as a potential 
causative factor in damaging the epithelium (Kaur, Lal, Rana, Kakkar, & Singh, 2009). Therefore, a 
preservative in eye drops may increase the risk of both adverse effects on the ocular surface and the 
possibility of allergic reactions. The risk of damage increases with increased frequency of dosing due to 
increased exposure to preservatives. 
Damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium due to use of eye drops containing preservatives is 
currently included in the RMP as an important potential risk.

The applicant has previously sought EMA Scientific Advice in relation to netarsudil mono-component 
and FDC products and questions relating specifically to the BAK concentration were discussed during 
the SA procedures. In this context, the CHMP has previously acknowledged the applicant’s plans to 
optimise preservative concentrations in both netarsudil monotherapy and fixed dose combination (FDC) 
formulations.  
An overall summary which presents the AEs by clinical study (Phase II versus Phase III) and treatment 
group is presented below in Table 30 (Phase 2 study) and Table 31 (Phase 3 studies). 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
A total of 329 AEs were reported in 186 of the 297 subjects (62.6%) who received test treatment.  The 
number of AEs reported in each treatment group was as follows:  
•  79 TEAEs in 47 subjects (64.4%, 47/73) for netarsudil/latanoprost 0.01% 
•  101 AEs in 55 subjects (75.3%, 55/73) for netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02% 
•  107 AEs in 60 subjects (76.9%, 60/78) for netarsudil 
•  42 AEs in 24 subjects (32.9%, 24/73) for latanoprost.  
The majority of AEs in all treatment groups were ocular in nature and were judged as treatment-
related. All AEs in the netarsudil/latanoprost groups (0.01% and 0.02%) were assessed as mild or 
moderate.  No SAEs were reported in either of the netarsudil/latanoprost groups or the netarsudil 
group; however, 5 SAEs were reported in 3 subjects in the latanoprost group. 
Of note, the number of AEs reported in the proposed FDC netarsudil/latanoprost product was very 
similar to the number of AEs reported for the netarsudil only product. AE reports in both groups were 
significantly higher than for latanoprost alone. The majority of AEs reported were ocular ARs. This is 
not unexpected given the existing knowledge on local ocular tolerability profile established for the 
active substance netarsudil. It is noted that no additive impact on AEs was observed between the FDC 
product when compared to netarsudil alone.

Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
In the 12-month PG324-CS301 study, a total of: 
•  770 AEs were reported in 197 subjects (82.8%, 197/238) in the netarsudil/latanoprost group 
•  751 reported in 190 subjects (78.2%, 190/243) in the netarsudil group 
•  354 reported in 128 subjects (54.0%, 128/237) in the latanoprost group.   
In the 3-month PG324-CS302 study, a total of; 
•  496 AEs were reported in 171 subjects (70.1%, 171/244) in the netarsudil/latanoprost group,

•  439 reported in 161 subjects (63.1%, 161/255) in the netarsudil group 
•  186 reported in 109 subjects (43.4%, 109/251) in the latanoprost group.  
In both studies, the majority of AEs in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups, and nearly 
half of the AEs in the latanoprost group, were ocular in nature.  
Most AEs were judged as treatment-related and the majority (≥ 95%) were assessed as mild or 
moderate.   
Serious AEs occurred in ≤4.2% of subjects in any treatment group; however, no treatment-related 
SAEs occurred in either study. 
Overall Summary of Adverse Events by Clinical Study and Treatment Group (Phase 3 
Studies) (Safety Population) 
Table 31 
In the pooled population, the overall number of subjects reporting at least one AE (either ocular or 
non-ocular) was greater in the netarsudil/latanoprost (76.3%) and netarsudil (70.5%) groups, 
compared to the latanoprost (48.6%) group.  
The same was true for subjects with at least one ocular AE (74.1%, 67.9%, and 40.2%, respectively) 
and for subjects with treatment-related AEs (67.6%, 60.8%, and 32.4%, respectively).

The majority of subjects reporting AEs in all 3 treatment groups reported AEs which were mild in 
severity (76.1%; 280/368, 76.1%; 267/351, and 78.9%; 187/237, respectively).  
No treatment-related SAEs were reported in any group. The percentage of SAEs was 1.5%, 3.2%, and 
3.1% in the netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively. 
Across all treatment groups, a higher rate of ocular AEs was observed in White subjects compared with 
non-White subjects and the difference was approximately 20%; there were no notable differences in 
AE rates between other demographic subgroups. 
Common Adverse Events 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
Ocular AEs reported at a rate ≥1% in the Phase 2 study are summarised below.   
Conjunctival hyperaemia was the most commonly reported ocular AE in any treatment group, occurring 
at a rate of 41.1% (n = 30), 39.7% (n = 29), 39.7% (n = 31), and 13.7% (n = 10) in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost 0.01%, netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02%, netarsudil 0.02%, and latanoprost 
0.005% groups, respectively.   
Instillation site erythema was reported in > 15% of eyes in each of the netarsudil containing groups, 
and instillation site pain was reported in 11.0% of eyes in the netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02% group. The 
majority of the ocular AEs were considered to be treatment related.

Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Ocular AEs 
Ocular AEs reported at a rate ≥1% are summarised in Table 35 below.  
The most common ocular AE (reported at a rate ≥10%) in both studies included conjunctival 
hyperaemia, followed by conjunctival haemorrhage, cornea verticillata (none reported for latanoprost), 
eye pruritus, and instillation site pain. In general, these frequently reported AEs occurred at a higher 
rate in the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups than in the latanoprost groups.  
The majority of the reported ocular AEs were considered to be treatment related (Table 36). 
Ocular AEs were graded as mild in the majority of the affected subjects (81% to 100%) across all 3 
treatment groups in both studies.  
Conjunctival hyperaemia was graded as mild in 85.3%, 84.8% and 96.2% of affected subjects in 
PG324-CS301 and 88.7%, 93.6%, 96.4% of affected subjects in PG324-CS302 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively.  
Cornea verticillata was graded as mild in 100% and 97.0% of affected subjects in PG324-CS301 and 
96.9% and 96.0% of affected subjects in PG324-CS302 in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil 
groups, respectively.  
Conjunctival haemorrhage was graded as mild in 100%, 97.7%, and 100% of affected subjects in 
PG324-CS301 and 95.2%, 100% and 100% of affected subjects in PG324-CS302 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively (CSR PG324-CS301, CSR 
PG324-CS302).

Table 37 presents the summary of treatment-emergent ocular AEs reported in > 1% of subjects in any 
treatment group in the pooled population. In the netarsudil/latanoprost group, the most common 
ocular AEs (reported at an incidence of ≥5%) included conjunctival hyperaemia (58.7%), instillation 
site pain (20.1%), cornea verticillata (15.4%), conjunctival haemorrhage (10.8%), eye pruritus 
(7.7%), VA reduced (5.2%), lacrimation increased (5.2%), and instillation site discomfort (5.2%). The 
same events (with the exception of eye pruritus, VA reduced, and instillation site discomfort) were 
reported at an incidence of ≥5% in the netarsudil group but at rates slightly lower than the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group (other than punctate keratitis, conjunctival haemorrhage and lacrimation 
increased, which were higher in the netarsudil group). In the latanoprost group, the most commonly 
reported AE was conjunctival hyperaemia (22.1%). The AE distribution in the pooled analysis is 
consistent with each individual study analysis.

The incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia was reported at a higher rate in White subjects (66.8%, 
53.9%, and 26.2%) compared to subjects of other races (42.5%, 33.1%, and 14.4%) in all treatment 
groups (netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively). There were no 
differences of note in the rate of conjunctival hyperaemia for other demographic categories. 
The incidence of conjunctival haemorrhage was reported at a higher rate in White subjects (11.8%, 
16.9%, and 1.2%) compared to subjects of other races (8.8%, 9.6%, and 0.6%) in all treatment 
groups (netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively).  
Cornea verticillata was reported only in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups, and it 
generally occurred at a higher rate in subjects ≥65 years of age, in males, and in White subjects.  
No clinically relevant difference was observed in these demographic subcategories in the AE 
distribution.

The incidence of non-ocular AEs was low in all treatment groups in the 2 studies. No individual non-
ocular AE exceeded the rate of 4% in any treatment group (Table 40).  Treatment-related non-ocular 
AEs were minimal.

For the pooled population, all non-ocular AEs were reported at a rate of <2% in the study. The most 
frequently reported non-ocular AE in the netarsudil/latanoprost group was nasopharyngitis (1.7%), 
followed by dermatitis contact (1.5%); both AEs were reported at a higher rate than in the netarsudil 
and latanoprost groups. 
The only treatment-related non-ocular AE reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any treatment group was 
dermatitis contact, which was reported for 5 subjects (1.0%) in the netarsudil/latanoprost group. 
Post-hoc Analysis of TEAEs by Age (PG324-CS201, PG324-CS301 and PG324 CS302) 
A post-hoc statistical analysis was performed on the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies to verify if 
there is a specific age-range where TEAEs or a specific TEAE is more frequent. 
The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events by age-range for all patients from PG324 
CS201, PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302 studies have shown no major difference amongst the age-
groups < 65, 65-74, 75-85 and ≥85 (Table 41). 
Table 41. Number and Percentage of Subjects by Age Group Randomized Population - All

followed by instillation site pain (netarsudil/latanoprost 23.1%, netarsudil 24.7%, latanoprost 7.6%), 
conjunctival haemorrhage (netarsudil/latanoprost 13.0%, netarsudil 18.1%, latanoprost 1.3%), cornea 
verticillata (netarsudil/latanoprost 17.6%, netarsudil 13.6%, latanoprost 0%), and eye pruritus 
(netarsudil/latanoprost 11.3%, netarsudil 9.1%, latanoprost 1.3%). Other ocular AEs reported at a 
rate of ≥ 1% in the netarsudil/latanoprost group were punctate keratitis, increased lacrimation, 
reduced VA, blurred vision, blepharitis, eye irritation, erythema of eyelid, instillation site discomfort, 
instillation site erythema, allergic conjunctivitis, vital dye staining cornea present, contact dermatitis, 
conjunctival edema, eyelid edema, dry eye, Meibomian gland dysfunction, chalazion, eyelid pruritus, 
corneal deposits, visual field defect, eye pain, foreign body sensation in eyes, photophobia, eyelid 
margin crusting, and conjunctival disorder. The majority of ocular AEs were graded as mild or 
moderate in severity and did not result in test article discontinuation. Non-ocular AEs were infrequent.  
A total of 32 SAEs were reported from 25 subjects and none were considered related to treatment. No 
treatment-related SAEs were reported in the study. Non-treatment-related SAEs were reported in 
2.1% (n = 5) of subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost group as compared to 4.1% (n = 10) subjects in 
the netarsudil group and 4.2% (n = 10) subjects in the latanoprost group. All SAEs reported during the 
treatment period were non-ocular SAEs. One subject in the netarsudil group died as the result of 
atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease, which was considered unrelated to treatment.  
Overall, 15.2% of subjects (20.6%, 23.0%, and 1.7% in netarsudil/latanoprost, netarsudil, and 
latanoprost respectively) discontinued test article due to an AE.  
Laboratory values:  Changes from baseline laboratory results were not clinically significant and were 
observed in 40.1% of subjects in netarsudil/latanoprost group, with no apparent differences among 
treatment groups. 
Vital signs: Mean changes in vital signs throughout the study were minimal (HR less than 2 bpm and 
BP less than 2 mmHg). 
Visual acuity: The worst change in VA from baseline was similar across all treatment groups and most 
subjects experienced loss of less than 1 line throughout their study participation. A total of 39 subjects 
experienced VA loss of 3 lines or more in the study eye; the majority of these cases were transient and 
the subjects’ VA improved at subsequent visits. 
Biomicroscopy/Ophthalmoscopy:  The number of subjects with clinically-significant changes in any 
biomicroscopy parameter was low, with no statistically significant differences between groups in any 
parameter except conjunctival hyperaemia. Conjunctival hyperaemia that was generally mild in nature 
was reported in a higher percentage of subjects in both the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil 
groups as compared to the latanoprost group. Changes in ophthalmoscopy examination findings 
included isolated cases of optic nerve and macular abnormalities occurring in 2 subjects in the 
netarsudil group. 
Netarsudil/latanoprost was considered safe and generally well-tolerated, with relatively few reported 
systemic AEs.  Most AEs were mild and did not result in study discontinuation. No serious treatment-
related AEs were reported.  No new TEAEs were reported that had not previously been observed in 
studies of netarsudil or reported for commercially available latanoprost. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the Phase 2 study; however, 2 deaths in the netarsudil group, unrelated to 
the test treatment, were reported in the Phase 3 studies (Table 42).   
Subject narratives for those cases were provided for the PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302 studies.

Table 42 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 51 SAEs were reported for 41 subjects in the 3 studies. All but 2 events were non ocular (1 
case of ulcerative keratitis in the latanoprost group in PG324-CS201, 1 case of retinal detachment in 
the latanoprost group in PG324-CS302), and none were considered treatment-related. Narratives for 
all SAEs are provided in the individual CSRs. None of the SAEs reported in any of the studies raised a 
concern regarding the safety of netarsudil/latanoprost. 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
A total of 5 SAEs were reported for 3 subjects in the latanoprost group. No SAEs were reported in any 
other treatment group.  All SAEs, except 1 case of ulcerative keratitis, were non-ocular and included 
one subject with perforated colon and two episodes of diverticulitis, and one subject with acute 
cholecystitis (Table 43).

Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
A total of 47 SAEs, including 2 deaths, were reported for 38 subjects of the 1,468 subjects in Phase 3 
(pooled population).  The overall rates of SAEs were low (≤3.2%) in all 3 treatment groups. All 
individual SAE types occurred at most in 2 (<0.5%) subjects within a treatment group.  None of the 
SAEs was considered treatment-related. With the exception of a single ocular event (retinal 
detachment) in the latanoprost treatment group, all other SAEs were non-ocular in nature. 
SAEs in each treatment group were distributed across a wide range of SOCs.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory testing was performed at the screening and exit visits in all 3 pivotal clinical studies. 
If a subject discontinued from the study prematurely, laboratory testing was completed at the time of 
the subject’s last visit. Centralised laboratories were used to provide supplies, coordinate shipment of 
the samples, and analyse the samples.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020

Clinical laboratory test results were evaluated for clinical relevance and reported as “normal” or 
“abnormal”. Screening test results were evaluated for subject eligibility criteria, and post treatment 
test results were assessed for the occurrence of AEs by the Investigator. Fasting was not required by 
any of the study protocols and this was taken into consideration during evaluation of laboratory values 
for AEs. 
Haematology 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
Abnormal changes from baseline in haematology values were observed in up to 24.7% (18/73) of 
subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost groups, and up to 24.7% (19/77) and 19.2% (14/73) of subjects 
in the netarsudil and latanoprost groups, respectively, at 3 months. A single non-treatment-related AE 
of increased eosinophil count for a subject in the netarsudil group was reported.  
Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Abnormal changes from baseline in haematology values were observed in up to 22.8 % (53/232) of 
subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost group in PG324-CS301 and up to 23.9% (56/234) of subjects in 
PG324-CS302. Similar results were observed in the netarsudil and latanoprost groups. A total of 3 non-
treatment-related AEs were reported as a result of abnormal haematology values. 
One (1) subject in the PG324-CS301 netarsudil/latanoprost group had decreased haematocrit and 
haemoglobin, low mean cell haemoglobin concentration, and decreased mean cell haemoglobin 
concentration and mean cell volume.  Two other subjects (1 each in PG324-CS301 and PG324 CS302) 
in the netarsudil group were reported with increased haemoglobin. 
In the pooled population, the mean haematology values at the exit visit remained within the reference 
ranges, with minimal changes from baseline, for all treatment groups.  
In summary, the changes in individual and mean values in some haematology parameters were of 
limited clinical relevance, occurred in all treatment groups, and did not result in discontinuation of test 
article. AEs were reported but were not related to the test treatment. No new safety issues were 
identified based upon a review of all haematology laboratory parameters. 
Clinical Chemistry 
Phase 2 study (PG324-CS201) 
Abnormal changes from baseline in chemistry values were observed in up to 38.4% (28/73) of 
subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost groups, up to 28.2% (22/78) of subjects in the netarsudil, and 
up to 38.4% (28/73) of subjects in the latanoprost groups at 3 months. A total of 5 non-treatment-
related AEs were reported in 5 subjects in all treatment groups were reported as a result of abnormal 
chemistry values. These AEs included 3 cases of increased blood triglycerides and 2 cases of increased 
blood glucose.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 113/145 
 
 
 
 
Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Abnormal changes from baseline in chemistry values were observed in up to 40.1% (93/232) of 
subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost group in PG324-CS301 and in up to 39.4% (93/236) of subjects 
in PG324-CS302. Similar results were observed in the netarsudil and latanoprost groups.  
A total of 29 AEs related to abnormal chemistry values were reported in the Phase 3 studies; 8 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group, 13 in the netarsudil group, and 8 in the latanoprost group. These AEs 
included increased blood triglycerides (9 in PG324-CS301, 3 in PG324-CS302), increased blood glucose 
(6 in PG324-CS301 and 4 in PG324-CS032), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 1 in PG324-
CS301, 2 in PG324-CS302), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 1 in PG324-CS301 and 2 in 
PG324-CS302), and 1 case of increased blood creatinine in PG324-CS301. All but 7 of the events were 
assessed as unrelated to treatment. 
The 7 treatment-related AEs (increased triglycerides: 3, increased ALT: 2, increased AST: 2) were all 
mild or moderate in severity and did not result in test article discontinuation.  The non-fasting subject 
status prior to obtaining blood samples likely accounted for the increase in blood glucose and 
triglycerides AEs. 
In the pooled population, the mean chemistry values at the exit visit all remained within the reference 
ranges with minimal changes from baseline. 
In summary, an evaluation of all clinical chemistry test results in the pooled population revealed that 
there were changes in individual and mean values in some measurements; however, the changes were 
of no clinical relevance and occurred in all treatment groups, with no trends observed. 
VITAL SIGNS, PHYSICAL FINDINGS, AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO SAFETY 
Vital Signs 
Blood pressure (BP) and HR were assessed in all 3 clinical studies at all scheduled visits. Changes in 
vital signs were assessed for the occurrence of an AE by the Investigator. 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
Mean changes in BP and HR were low throughout the trial and comparable between the 
netarsudil/latanoprost groups and the individual therapies tested. Mean BP was approximately 129-
133/77-79 mmHg, and mean BP at baseline was 70-72 bpm. Mean changes in BP of < 5 mmHg and in 
HR of ≤ 5 bpm were observed for subjects across all treatment groups. No AEs related to vital sign 
changes were reported in the study. 
Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Mean changes in BP and HR were small in each study and comparable across treatment groups.  
In PG324-CS301, mean BP was approximately 132-134/78-79 mmHg, and mean HR at baseline was 
72 bpm. Mean changes in BP of < ±2 mmHg and in HR of < ± 2 bpm were observed for subjects 
across all treatment groups.  AEs reflective of changes in vital signs were blood pressure increased, 
and were observed in 4 latanoprost subjects. These events were rated as mild or moderate and none 
resulted in test article discontinuation.  
In PG324-CS302, mean BP was approximately 131-135/78-79 mmHg, and mean HR at baseline was 
72 73 bpm. Mean changes in BP of < 3 mmHg and in HR of < ±1 bpm were observed for subjects 
across all treatment groups.  One AE of increased BP was reported for a netarsudil/latanoprost subject. 
The event was rated as mild and did not result in test article discontinuation.   
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 114/145 
 
 
 
 
In summary, the mean changes from baseline in BP, and HR were generally small and not clinically 
relevant. 
Physical Examination Findings 
Neither the Phase 2 nor Phase 3 studies required a physical examination; therefore, no physical 
examination was performed. 
Other Observations Related to Safety 
Visual Acuity 
Visual acuity was assessed using an ETDRS or equivalent chart at all scheduled visits during each 
study. Visual acuity testing preceded IOP measurement, the administration of topical anesthetic 
agents, or any examination requiring contact with the anterior segment. In order to standardize the 
assessment of VA for a subject, all measurements were performed using the same lighting conditions 
and viewing distance. The analysis of VA included mean changes and worst changes from baseline.  
Subjects with a ≥ 3-line worsening from baseline were identified and analysed separately. Overall, VA 
results revealed that mean changes from baseline were small, similar across treatment groups, and 
not clinically relevant. 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
Mean changes from baseline in study eye VA were small in the latanoprost/netarsudil (≤ 0.03 logMAR) 
and control groups (netarsudil: ≤ 0.02 logMAR and latanoprost:  ≤ 0.01 logMAR). 
Five (5) subjects had VA decrease ≥ 0.3 logMAR (i.e., ≥ 3 ETDRS chart lines) in the study eye; in all 
cases, VA decrease was transient in nature and the subjects’ vision improved at subsequent visits.  Of 
these, 3 subjects were in the netarsudil/latanoprost 0.01% group, 1 was in the netarsudil/latanoprost 
0.02% group, and 1 was in the netarsudil group (Table 45). 
No subject discontinued the study due to reduced VA.

Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302) 
Mean changes from baseline in VAs were small across all treatment groups. 
In PG324-CS301 study, the worst change from baseline VA outcomes were similar across treatment 
groups, with most subjects experiencing < 1 line of VA decrease throughout their study participation. 
VA decrease of ≥ 0.3 logMAR in the study eye was reported in 25 subjects (10 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost, 11 in the netarsudil, and 4 in the latanoprost groups), 14 of which were judged 
as treatment related. The majority of the VA loss was transient and subjects’ vision improved at 
subsequent visits. Four (4) subjects (1 in the netarsudil/latanoprost group and 3 in the netarsudil 
group) discontinued the study due to reduced VA. 
In PG324-CS302, the worst change from baseline in VA outcomes were similar across treatment 
groups, with the majority of the subjects experiencing < 1 line of VA decrease throughout their study 
participation.  VA decrease of ≥ 0.3 logMAR in the study eye was reported in 7 subjects (3 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group and 4 in the netarsudil group).  The majority of the VA loss was transient 
and subjects’ vision improved at subsequent visits. 
A total of 2 subjects (1 in the netarsudil and 1 in the latanoprost groups) discontinued the study due to 
reduced VA.

With respect to the pooled population, mean changes from baseline in VA were small in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost (study eye 0.003 to 0.013; fellow eye 0.011 to 0.019), netarsudil (study eye 
0.005 to 0.028; fellow eye 0.002 to 0.022), and the latanoprost (study eye -0.003 to 0.007, fellow eye 
-0.003 to 0.009) groups. The changes were not clinically relevant and the majority of subjects had a 
worst change of ≤1-line loss of VA.  
Within the overall pooled population, 32 subjects experienced ≥3-line loss of VA in the study eye: 13 
(2.7%) in the netarsudil/latanoprost group, 15 (3.0%) in the netarsudil group, and 4 (0.8%) in the 
latanoprost group. Similar results were observed for the fellow eye. 
Additionally, within each treatment group, no clinically relevant differences in the proportion of 
subjects with a ≥3-line change from baseline was observed in subgroups based on age category (<65 
years vs ≥65 years), sex (females vs males), race (Whites vs other races), and iris color 
(blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs hazel), (<65 years vs ≥65 years), gender (females vs males), race 
(White vs other races) and iris color (blue/green/grey:1 vs black/brown vs hazel). 
The presence of cornea verticillata, which was reported only in the Phase 3 netarsudil/latanoprost and 
netarsudil groups, did not affect VA outcome. The mean changes of VA from baseline were similar 
between the subjects who had cornea verticillata and those who did not have cornea verticillata in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups, indicating that VA was not affected by the presence 
of cornea verticillata. 
A total of 55 AEs were reported for VA reduced, with higher incidences in the netarsudil/latanoprost 
(5.2%) and netarsudil (4.2%) groups, as compared to latanoprost (1.8%).  Within each treatment 
group, similar incidences were observed for the subgroups of age and gender. In the 
netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups, White subjects had higher incidences of VA loss than 
other races (White vs other races). The same was true for subjects with hazel iris color compared to 
those with darker iris colors (blue/green/grey vs black/brown vs hazel). 
While a higher incidence of AEs related to VA, and a higher rate of ≥3-line loss of vision was reported in 
the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups, the AEs were predominately of mild severity, 
transient, and did not result in discontinuation of test article.  
Biomicroscopy  
External examination of the eye and anterior segment were performed with slit lamp biomicroscopy 
using magnification consistent with clinical practice. Biomicroscopy grading was done with the use of 
standardized scales provided in each of the study protocols. Biomicroscopy included the assessment of 
the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil and lens, using standard grading scales 
(0 - 3 for eyelid erythema and edema, conjunctival hyperaemia and edema, corneal staining and 
edema, anterior chamber flare, and lens; 0 - 4 for anterior chamber cells).  
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
The most common clinically significant biomicroscopy observation was conjunctival hyperaemia (Table 
48), which occurred at a higher incidence in the netarsudil/latanoprost groups. The maximum study 
eye rates were for netarsudil/latanoprost 0.01% (26.0%) and netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02% (22.1%) 
as compared to the other groups (netarsudil: 18.2%; latanoprost: 2.7%).  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 117/145 
 
 
 
 
 
A higher proportion of subjects across all treatment groups experienced an increase in hyperaemia 
severity grade as compared to other biomicroscopy findings (Table 49). In the majority of cases across 
all treatment groups, conjunctival hyperaemia was graded as mild (PG324 CS201 Table 14.3.5.4.1).  
The incidence of clinically significant hyperaemia observed by slit lamp was lower than the reported 
incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia AEs (Section 2.1.2.1, Table 20), suggesting that the reported AEs 
may include cases of clinically non significant and subject-reported conjunctival hyperaemia.

Parameters in the Study Eye at any Treatment Visit (Phase 2 Study) (Safety

Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Although conjunctival hyperaemia continued to be the most commonly reported clinically significant 
biomicroscopy finding (Table 50) in the Phase 3 studies, the incidence of clinically significant 
hyperaemia in the netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02% group in each study was considerably lower than 
observed in the Phase 2 study.  
A higher proportion of subjects across all treatment groups experienced an increase in conjunctival 
hyperaemia severity rate compared to other biomicroscopy findings (Table 50). In the majority of 
cases across all treatment groups, conjunctival hyperaemia was graded as mild and the incidence of 
clinically significant hyperaemia observed by slit lamp was lower than the incidence of conjunctival 
hyperaemia AEs.

Table 51. Maximum Number of Subjects with any Severity Grade Increase in Biomicroscopy 
Parameters in the Study Eye at any Treatment Visit (Phase 3 Studies) (Safety 
Population) 
Analysis of the pooled Phase 3 studies showed a similar profile to the individual studies with 
conjunctival hyperaemia being the most frequent biomicroscopy finding; this was reported in a higher 
percentage of subjects in both the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups, compared to the 
latanoprost group.   
In summary, for all biomicroscopy parameters except conjunctival hyperaemia, the number of subjects 
with clinically significant changes was low. Conjunctival hyperaemia was generally mild, and the slit 
lamp grading of conjunctival hyperaemia did not increase with continuous dosing over the course of 
the study. There were no significant differences between subgroups observed.  
Ophthalmoscopy 
Dilated ophthalmoscopy examination of the retina, macula, choroid, optic nerve, and vitreous humour 
was performed in all studies at the screening and study exit visits.  In PG324-CS301, which was 12 
months in duration, ophthalmoscopy examinations were also performed at Months 3 and 6.  Findings 
were graded as either “normal” or “abnormal”. Changes in ophthalmoscopy parameters from baseline 
were identified as clinically significant or non-clinically significant and reported as AEs based on the 
judgment of the Investigator. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 121/145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the most part, across all studies, there were relatively few changes in ophthalmoscopy, and the 
changes were similar across the treatment groups. This is reflected in the low rate of clinically 
significant findings that were reported as AEs across all treatment groups in each study.  
In the pooled Phase 3 population, there were very few clinically significant abnormal findings, with the 
most frequently reported findings related to optic nerve abnormalities.  This is not unexpected, given 
the subject population (i.e., OAG) under study, therefore the majority of these findings were not 
reported as AEs.  
An analysis of dilated ophthalmoscopy results by demographic subgroups did not reveal any clinically 
relevant differences as a function of age category (<65 years vs ≥65 years), sex (females vs males), 
race, or iris colour. 
The most frequently reported AEs consistent with ophthalmoscopy findings included vitreous 
detachment and vitreous floaters. The incidence of vitreous detachment was similar among treatment 
groups: 2 (0.4%) in the netarsudil/latanoprost, 2 (0.4%) in the netarsudil group and 3 (0.6%) in the 
latanoprost group.   
Vitreous floaters were reported in 3 (0.6%) subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost group only. All cases 
were assessed to be mild in severity and did not result in test article discontinuation. Additional AEs 
associated with the macula (fibrosis and edema) and retina (haemorrhage, detachment, tear and 
retinoschisis) were reported, but only as isolated events. 
Cup-Disc Ratio and Optic Disc Findings 
Measurement of the vertical cup-disc ratio (C/D) was performed as part of the dilated ophthalmoscopy 
examination at the screening and study exit visit in each study, and at 3 months and 6 months in 
PG324-CS301.  Cup-disc ratio was reported using a scale of 0.1 to 1.0, in 0.1 unit increments. 
Changes in this parameter were reported as AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. 
The mean C/D ratio remained relatively consistent throughout all studies.  In the Phase 2 study, no 
subjects had an increase in C/D ≥ 0.2.  
In the Phase 3 studies, 18 subjects in the 12-month PG324-CS301 study (3 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group, 6 in the netarsudil group, and 9 in the latanoprost group) and 3 subjects 
in the 3-month PG324 CS302 study (1 in the netarsudil/latanoprost group, 2 in the netarsudil group, 
and 1 in latanoprost group) had ≥ 0.2 increase in C/D. 
Clinically significant changes from baseline considered to be AEs were reported in only 3 subjects in 
both Phase 3 studies, and included 1 report of decreased optic nerve cup-disc ratio in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group, 1 report of optic disc disorder in the netarsudil group, and 1 report of 
increased optic nerve cup-disc ratio in the latanoprost group.  
A clinically significant increase in C/D, indicative of glaucoma progression, was reported in a smaller 
percentage of subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost group than in either the netarsudil or latanoprost 
groups.   
In summary for the pooled Phase 3 population, the mean cup-disc ratio baseline values were similar in 
the 3 treatment groups, and remained relatively constant over the treatment period. Isolated AEs 
reflective of changes in the optic nerve were reported, but no patterns emerged.

Ocular Tolerability (Comfort Assessment) 
In the Phase 2 study, ocular comfort was assessed based on AEs reported in response to subject 
symptom queries. In the Phase 3 studies (PG324-CS301 and PG324-CS302), ocular comfort was 
evaluated at all scheduled on-therapy 8 AM visits by questioning the subjects regarding any discomfort 
experienced while placing study medication drops in their eye.  Subject responses were scored as “no” 
discomfort, “mild” discomfort, “moderate” discomfort, or “severe” discomfort. 
In the Phase 3 studies, most of the subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost groups reported no 
discomfort associated with study drug administration at any visit (80.2% to 89.9% in PG324 CS301 
and 79.7% to 86.8% in PG324-CS302). Of those who reported discomfort, the majority were 
considered to be mild, and less than 6 % (5.9% in PG324-CS301 and 3.4% in PG324 CS302) were 
moderate or severe reports. These results were comparable to the netarsudil groups (none: 76.3% to 
91.9% in PG324-CS301 and 88.3% to 90.8% in PG324-CS302).  Fewer subjects tended to report 
ocular discomfort in the latanoprost groups (none: 91.0% to 96.6% in PG324 CS301 and 92.0% to 
95.9% in PG324-CS302). This finding is consistent with AE reporting of administration site conditions. 
Analysis of the pooled Phase 3 studies showed a similar profile to the individual studies.  An analysis of 
ocular discomfort by demographic subgroups revealed similar results within treatment groups for age 
category and iris colour. 
Greater incidences of moderate or severe discomfort in the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil 
groups were observed in Whites compared with subjects of other races, and in females compared with 
males. 
In summary, subjects in the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups reported slightly less 
ocular comfort upon instillation than latanoprost subjects. The incidences of instillation site pain and 
instillation site discomfort were higher in the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups than the 
latanoprost group. All AEs, however, were mild or moderate and the majority of affected subjects did 
not have the event lead to discontinuation of treatment.  
Pupil Size 
Pupil size was not measured in the Phase 2 study.   
In the Phase 3 studies, this parameter was measured at the qualifying visit and all 8AM post-
randomisation visits in ambient room light prior to any ocular procedures requiring dilation.  
Measurement was performed to the nearest 0.5 mm using a ruler. 
The mean pupil size at baseline was similar across treatment groups in both Phase 3 studies, ranging 
from 3.43 to 3.69 mm. Minimal mean change from baseline was observed for all treatment groups (≤ 
0.12 mm in PG324-CS301 and < 0.07 mm in PG24-CS302), which was not clinically meaningful. AEs 
associated with pupil diameter changes included isolated reports of miosis (2 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group, 2 in the netarsudil group, and 3 in the latanoprost group in PG324-
CS301; 1 in the netarsudil/latanoprost group in PG324-CS302) and mydriasis (1 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group and 2 in the latanoprost group in PG324-CS301. All associated AEs were 
mild and did not result in treatment discontinuation. 
The mean baseline pupil size measurements in the overall pooled Phase 3 population were similar in 
the netarsudil/latanoprost (study eye 3.58 mm; fellow eye 3.58 mm), netarsudil (study eye 3.51 mm; 
fellow eye 3.52 mm), and latanoprost (study eye 3.53 mm; fellow eye 3.53 mm) groups. The 
numerical changes in pupil size by Month 3, Month 6 or Month 12 were all less than 0.12 and 
therefore, not clinically meaningful. There were no clinically relevant pupil size changes in any of the 3 
treatment groups.

Visual Fields 
In the Phase 2 study, visual field testing was performed only at screening to assess eligibility.   
In the Phase 3 studies, visual field testing was performed at the screening visit and at 3-month 
intervals thereafter until study exit.  Humphrey 24-2 or 30-2 or SITA standard and SITA Fast 
algorithms were used to evaluate visual fields.  Changes in visual field parameters were reported as 
AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. 
In the Phase 3 studies, similar baseline visual field mean deviation (MD) values were observed in the 
study eye across all treatment groups at the screening visit (-2.08 dB to -2.49 dB in PG324 CS301; 
2.35 dB to -2.44 dB in PG324-CS302) and at the baseline visit (PG324-CS301 only:  2.06 dB to -2.52 
dB).  
In PG324-CS301, which had a 12-month duration, minimal decrease in mean visual field MD was 
observed in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups.  In the latanoprost group, mean visual 
field MD decreased slightly at the month 3 and month 12 visits, and increased slightly at all other 
visits. Across all treatment groups, mean change from baseline ranged from -0.003 dB to -0.63 dB. 
Visual field defect AEs were reported in 9 subjects (5 in the netarsudil/latanoprost group, 3 in the 
netarsudil group, and 1 in the latanoprost group); 1 of these AEs in the latanoprost group was judged 
to be related to treatment. 
In PG324-CS302, which had a 3-month duration, minimal decrease in mean visual field MD was 
observed in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups, while an increase in mean visual field MD 
was observed in the latanoprost group at all visits. Mean change from baseline ranged from -0.024 dB 
to +0.130 dB.  A visual field defect AE, unrelated to treatment, was reported in 1 subject in the 
latanoprost group. 
Analysis of the pooled Phase 3 studies showed a similar profile to the individual studies. 
Subgroup analyses by demographic category revealed no clinically relevant differences in visual field 
mean deviation change from baseline as a function of age category, sex, race or iris colour. 
In summary, the mean changes in visual field mean deviation from the screening to exit visits were 
small. The incidence of AEs of visual field defect was low and subjects with the events did not have the 
event lead to discontinuation of test article.  
Specular Microscopy 
Specular microscopy was performed only in PG324-CS302.   
This testing was done at selected sites based upon the availability of a specular microscope. Prior to 
providing any corneal endothelial cell photographs, the study sites were certified by the centralized 
reading centre. During the study, the sites provided 3 images of each eye and the data were submitted 
electronically via a web portal to the centralized reading centre. The investigational sites with a 
specular microscope captured images of the corneal endothelium at the qualification (baseline) and the 
3-month visit. Parameters were analysed at the centralized reading centre and included endothelial cell 
density, coefficient of variation (variation in individual cell area; also known as polymegathism), and 
hexagonality (percentage of 6 sided cells; also known as pleomorphism).  
Baseline endothelial cell density in the study eyes was similar in all treatment groups 
(netarsudil/latanoprost (n=160) 2464 cells/mm2, netarsudil (n=172) 2506 cells/mm2, latanoprost 
(n=160) 2448 cells/mm2. The mean change in cell density from baseline to Month 3 was not clinically 
meaningful in any of the treatment groups (netarsudil/latanoprost +12.3 cells/mm2, netarsudil +12.3 
cells/mm2, and latanoprost -0.9 cells/mm2). The results were similar for fellow eyes. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 124/145 
 
 
 
No changes in corneal endothelial cell density nor corneal oedema were reported. 
 A change in corneal endothelial morphology from Screening to Exit visits was reported in a small 
number of eyes (26/851; all from either of 2 of the 31 sites that performed specular microscopy) which 
was not clinically meaningful.  Some of the changes reported were likely due to measurement error 
(number of cells counted was too small). 
In summary, the changes in endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, and hexagonality from 
baseline to Month 3 were small and not clinically relevant. 
Pachymetry 
Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured in both eyes using ultrasound pachymetry at screening 
in all studies.  Post-treatment pachymetry was only performed in the Phase 3 studies, however.  
Measurements were taken at the 3-month visit in both studies, and at the 6-month visit in PG324-
CS301.  
Baseline CCT in the Phase 3 studies ranged from 547 µm to 553 µm in the study and fellow eyes 
across all treatment groups. Changes in CCT from baseline were not clinically significant.  In the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group, mean change was ≤ -6.3 µm in the study eye and ≤ -7.6 µm in the fellow 
eye; in the netarsudil group, mean change was ≤ -5.4 µm in both the study eye and the fellow eye; 
and in the latanoprost group, mean change was ≤ -0.7 µm in the study eye and ≤  0.8 µm in the fellow 
eye.   
Only 1 case of corneal oedema was reported in the netarsudil group in study PG324-CS301. 
In this eye, corneal oedema was graded as severe and reported with a number of concomitant ocular 
AEs (including: chalazion, lid erythema, conjunctival oedema, conjunctival hyperaemia, blepharitis, and 
reduced VA).  The event resolved and did not result in treatment discontinuation. 
Analysis of the pooled Phase 3 studies showed a similar profile to the individual studies. 
Subgroup analyses by demographic categories revealed no clinically relevant differences in central 
corneal thickness change from baseline as a function of age, sex, race or iris colour. 
In summary, no clinically relevant differences in central corneal thickness change were observed. A 
single case of severe corneal oedema was reported, which resolved and did not result in treatment 
discontinuation. 
Intraocular Pressure 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at the screening and/or qualifying, and all post-
randomisation visits in all studies. At least 2 consecutive IOP measurements of each eye were obtained 
at each time point during each visit, using a calibrated Goldmann applanation tonometer. On-therapy 
IOP increases of ≥ 10 mmHg in comparison with baseline were identified and changes in IOP were 
reported as AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. 
No AEs related to IOP changes were reported in the Phase 2 study. 
In the Phase 3 studies, IOP-related AEs were reported for 5 subjects in PG324-CS301 (4 in the 
netarsudil group and 1 in the latanoprost group), and for 3 subjects in PG324-CS302 (1 in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group and 2 in the latanoprost group). One (1) event in the netarsudil group 
was graded as severe.  Four subjects (3 in the netarsudil group and 1 in the latanoprost group) 
discontinued test article use due to elevated IOP. 
With respect to the pooled Phase 3 population; in the study eye, 3 (0.6%) subjects in the netarsudil 
group and 2 (0.4%) in the latanoprost group experienced a ≥10 mmHg IOP increase at any post-
Assessment report

baseline visit. In the fellow eye, 4 (0.8%) subjects in the netarsudil group and 3 (0.6%) in the 
latanoprost group experienced a ≥10 mmHg IOP increase at any post-baseline visit. 
In summary, both the netarsudil and latanoprost group had subjects who experienced IOP increase of 
≥10 mmHg and discontinued the study, while there were no such cases in the netarsudil/latanoprost 
group. 
Overall, no significant new safety signals arise from the data presented in relation to Laboratory 
investigations for the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The safety parameters evaluated in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were analysed based on various 
intrinsic factors that included sex, age category, race, ethnicity, and iris colour. 
In general, there were no clinically relevant differences in safety profile across demographic groups 
between netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution and the monotherapies tested. 
An analysis of safety in subjects with concomitant systemic medications was not performed since the 
systemic exposure to netarsudil/latanoprost has been shown to be negligible. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The recommended dosage of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.02% is 1 drop instilled into 
the eye QD for all patients. Therapy is not individualized based upon extrinsic factors; thus, an analysis 
of safety by extrinsic factors is not applicable. 
Drug Interactions 
Based upon the lack of systemic absorption, no specific drug-drug interaction studies were performed 
during the clinical development of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.02%; therefore, none 
were reported. 
Netarsudil/latanoprost has been administered safely in conjunction with other ophthalmic medications 
and diagnostic agents to include antibiotics, anesthetics, cycloplegics, mydriatics, ocular lubricants, 
and vital dyes.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no adequate or well-controlled studies evaluating the use of netarsudil/latanoprost in 
pregnant women. The clinical studies conducted during the development of netarsudil/latanoprost 
excluded women of childbearing potential who were pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not 
using a medically acceptable form of birth control. 
In the completed latanoprost/netarsudil clinical studies, one case of pregnancy was reported in the 
PG324-CS301 clinical study.  A 33-year old female Caucasian subject in the netarsudil 0.02% 
treatment group (subject ID 103-004) reportedly had a spontaneous miscarriage during the study. The 
spontaneous abortion was assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to the study drug. The case 
narratives of the pregnancy and spontaneous abortion are provided in the SAE narratives of CSR 
PG324-CS301. 
As of 31 July 2019, no case of latanoprost/netarsudil use in pregnant and lactating women was 
reported in Aerie’s post-marketing pharmacovigilance database from use of the commercial product in 
the United States.

Overdose 
Netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution is instilled into the conjunctival cul-de-sac, and, since only a 
very small volume of the solution is maintained on the ocular surface, overdose of the drug is 
precluded. Systemic exposure to netarsudil/latanoprost following topical ocular administration has 
been shown to be negligible. 
No reports of overdose were received during the clinical studies with netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution. No information is available on over-dosage in humans. 
Drug Abuse 
No incidences of drug abuse were reported in the clinical studies with netarsudil/latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No reports of withdrawal or rebound phenomena were received in the clinical studies with 
netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No evidence was gathered during the development of netarsudil/latanoprost that would suggest the 
ophthalmic solution results in impairment of mental ability or ability to operate machinery.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based upon the lack of systemic absorption, no specific drug-drug interaction studies were performed 
during the clinical development of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.02%; therefore, none 
were reported. 
Netarsudil/latanoprost has been administered safely in conjunction with other ophthalmic medications 
and diagnostic agents to include antibiotics, anesthetics, cycloplegics, mydriatics, ocular lubricants, 
and vital dyes. 
A summary of an in vitro study relating to concomitant thiomersal administration was provided with 
the responses. This concluded that precipitation occurs with co-administration of thiomersal containing 
preparations. The applicant has updated the PI to reflect this finding. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 2 Study (PG324-CS201) 
The incidence of AEs resulting in test article discontinuation was low (1.7%).  Ocular AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of test agent accounted for 1.4% of the events (1 subject each in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02%, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups) and included isolated reports of 
conjunctival haemorrhage, conjunctivitis, iritis, punctate keratitis, and ulcerative keratitis in 3 study 
subjects. Non-ocular AEs resulting in study discontinuation included bronchitis and contact dermatitis 
(each occurring in 1 subject).  
Phase 3 Studies (PG324-CS301, PG324-CS302) 
Test article discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the netarsudil/latanoprost (PG324-CS301: 20.6%, 
PG324-CS302: 7.0%) and the netarsudil (PG324-CS301: 23.0%, PG324-CS302: 6.3%) groups, 
compared to the latanoprost group (PG324-CS301: 1.7%, PG324-CS302: 1.6%).  
A higher rate of discontinuation occurred in PG324-CS301 than in PG324-CS302, which is not 
unexpected since PG324-CS301 followed subjects for 12 months duration, while PG324-CS302 
followed subjects for 3 months duration.  
The majority of discontinuations in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil groups were due to ocular 
AEs. Conjunctival hyperaemia was the only AE that led to test article discontinuation in > 2% of 
affected subjects in PG324-CS301 (netarsudil/latanoprost: 7.6%, netarsudil: 8.2%) (PG324 CS301 
Table 14.3.3.4) and PG324-CS302 (netarsudil/latanoprost: 2.5%, netarsudil: 2.0%) (PG324-CS302 
Table 14.3.3.4). The majority of discontinuations in the latanoprost group (3/4) in study PG324-CS301 
were associated with non-ocular AEs (fatigue, Parkinson's disease, and myocardial infarction), whereas 
in study PG324-CS302, all discontinuations in the latanoprost group (4/4) were associated with ocular 
AEs (conjunctival hyperaemia, eye pain, vision blurred, VA reduced, erythema of eyelid, and retinal 
detachment). 
With respect to the pooled population, the rate of discontinuation of test article due to AEs was higher 
in the netarsudil/latanoprost (13.7%) and the netarsudil (14.5%) groups, compared to latanoprost 
group (1.6%). The most frequently reported AEs that resulted in test agent discontinuation in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group was conjunctival hyperaemia (5.0%), followed by eye pruritus (1.5%) 
and instillation site pain (each 1.5%). All other events leading to discontinuation occurred at a rate of ≤
1%, (Table 53).

Safety Analysis of Ongoing Studies 
There is 1 clinical study ongoing with the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution (PG324-
CS303). The following information is based on masked safety data from the study as of a 31 July 2019 
cutoff date. The information presented includes enrollment updates, subject demographics, and an 
evaluation of AEs to include most frequently reported AEs, SAEs, subjects discontinued due to AEs, and 
deaths.  
Study PG324-CS303 is a Phase 3 prospective, double-masked, randomized, multicentre, active 
controlled, parallel-group, 6-month study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of 
netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution compared to Ganfort® (bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5%) 
ophthalmic solution in subjects with elevated IOP.  The study is being conducted in the EU. As of the 
31 July 2019 cutoff date 387 subjects have been screened and 290 subjects of mean age 68.3 years

(SD 10.77, range 25 to 91) have been randomized in this study.  Five SAEs, (none of which were 
considered treatment-related), and no deaths have been reported to date and no new safety issues 
relating to netarsudil/latanoprost have been identified.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The assessment of the clinical safety data for netarsudil 0.02%/latanoprost FDC was largely based on 
one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 clinical studies with netarsudil/latanoprost FDC. 
Additional safety data from the clinical studies assessed as part of the netarsudil 0.02% initial MAA are 
considered supportive. 
In terms of safety data, the overall patient exposure is considered broadly acceptable and satisfactory 
numbers of patients were exposed to netarsudil/latanoprost FDC in the safety population.  
A total of 628 subjects were treated with netarsudil/latanoprost in the three completed clinical studies 
with the fixed dose combination, including 146 in Phase II studies and 482 in Phase III studies. 
Additional exposure data for netarsudil/latanoprost FDC product is provided via the parallel clinical 
development for the single constituent netarsudil 0.02% product, which was approved in the EU in 
2019. 
The studied population is considered representative of the target population that is expected to receive 
Netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution. 
The demographic characteristics of patients included in the phase III clinical studies for 
netarsudil/latanoprost FDC once daily included patients ranging in age from 18 years onwards. 
Adequate numbers of elderly patients over 65 years were also included in the clinical studies. This is 
important given the target population of patients who generally require treatment for glaucoma. In 
patients treated with netarsudil/latanoprost once daily, 294 patients were ≥65 years, reflective of the 
target population.  
Paediatric patients were not included in the clinical studies and this is acceptable given the proposed 
indication and target population. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 131/145 
 
 
 
 
 
Caucasian patients represented the majority of patients exposed to netarsudil in the clinical studies. 
Most patients treated with netarsudil/latanoprost once daily in the phase III safety population were 
Caucasian (n=385). No specific clinical safety implications are expected to arise from the 
underrepresentation of patients of other ethnic origins. 
Duration of exposure for the FDC product is in general between 3- 12 months. The duration of 
exposure for the FDC product is longer in subjects with prior prostaglandin use compared with those 
with no prior prostaglandin use and no prior hypotensive drug use across all treatment groups. 
111 patients received treatment with the FDC beyond 12 months duration.  
Supportive data from completed clinical studies from the approved netarsudil 0.02% single constituent 
product development provided background safety data from 3, 6 and 12 month Phase 3 studies which 
included a total of 1,556 subjects including 636 subjects treated with netarsudil 0.02% QD. Within the 
netarsudil treatment group, 361 subjects were exposed to netarsudil 0.02% once daily for a duration 
of 6 months to 12 months. In addition, a total of 252 subjects completed over 12 months of therapy 
with netarsudil 0.02% once daily.  
In terms of long term safety, it is highlighted that the following post-authorisation observational cohort 
study is planned for the recently approved single constituent netarsudil ophthalmic product, Rhokiinsa: 
AR-13324-OBSXX Rhokiinsa observational cohort safety study in patients with primary open angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
It is envisaged that this study will adequately investigate the longer-term safety of the active 
substance netarsudil. In this context, the applicant has not proposed a further post-authorisation study 
for the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution as it is considered the Rhokiinsa study will 
provide the relevant data on longer term safety with active substance netarsudil. 
The applicant intends to initiate the Rhokiinsa study 12-18 months after launch of Rhokiinsa in the first 
EU member state. The study will include adult patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension prescribed Rhokiinsa under routine prescribed conditions. Selected sites in Europe will be 
asked to collect ocular safety data on patients prescribed Rhokiinsa at approximately 6 monthly 
intervals up to a total of 24 months. The aim of the study is to collect additional ocular safety of 
Rhokiinsa in adult patients under routine prescribed conditions over a 2-year period. Primary 
evaluation will focus on ocular safety at each time point (approximately 6 monthly intervals), recording 
the number, percentage and severity of each category of event.   
The issues raised during the assessment of clinical safety data related primarily to the following topics: 
- 
Higher frequency of certain ocular ADRs with netarsudil/latanoprost FDC when compared to 
netarsudil 0.02% monoconstituent product. Though it is important to highlight that for some ocular 
ADRs, the frequencies were higher in the netarsudil alone population, so it cannot be conclusively 
demonstrated that additive ocular ADRs occur with the FDC. 
- 
Limited longer term safety data with the FDC. Given the nature of glaucoma treatment, which 
usually requires chronic, long term treatment, it was considered that the need for additional safety 
data to support a longer term indication could be addressed through routine PV monitoring. In 
addition, additional insights on long term safety with netarsudil could be provided through the agreed 
PASS for the monoconstituent product, Rhokiinsa which will be conducted in parallel. 
- 
The use of Benzalkonium Chloride in the proposed product was discussed- including the 
applicant’s plans to optimise preservative concentrations in both netarsudil monotherapy and fixed 
dose combination (FDC) formulations. 
Safety profile 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 132/145 
 
 
 
Overall, results relevant to the characterisation of the general safety profile are broadly consistent 
across the pivotal clinical studies for the FDC. 
In general, treatment related AEs are similar across the FDC and netarsudil groups. AE reports in both 
populations treated with netarsudil either via treatment with the FDC or mono-component products are 
notably higher than with latanoprost alone. The majority of AEs in both groups are ocular ADRs.  
The incidence of non-ocular AEs was low in all treatment groups. 
Across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies for the FDC product, the following three ocular ADRs 
were consistently reported for netarsudil/latanoprost: i) conjunctival hyperaemia, ii) corneal verticillata 
(deposits) and iii) conjunctival haemorrhage. 
In the Phase III studies, the most common ocular AEs (reported at an incidence of ≥5%) in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group included conjunctival hyperaemia (58.7%), instillation site pain (20.1%), 
cornea verticillata (15.4%), conjunctival haemorrhage (10.8%), eye pruritus (7.7%), VA reduced 
(5.2%), lacrimation increased (5.2%), and instillation site discomfort (5.2%).  
This is similar to the TE AEs reported at an incidence of ≥5% in the netarsudil only group (with the 
exception of eye pruritus, VA reduced, and instillation site discomfort). 
Ocular AEs were notably lower in the latanoprost group where the most commonly reported AE was 
conjunctival hyperaemia (22.1%). 
While many of ADRs were generally considered mild-moderate in intensity and many resolved 
spontaneously over time (though others occurred sporadically), the frequency of the three most 
commonly observed ADRs and ocular ADRs in general was consistently found to be notably higher for 
the FDC and netarsudil 0.02% once daily when compared to latanoprost alone. Certain ocular ADRs 
were also reported at a slightly higher frequency in the FDC treatment group when compared to the 
netarsudil only treatment group, though this was not a consistent finding for all ocular ADRs. 
In the phase II study, it was noted that the incidence of instillation site pain was highest in the 0.02% 
concentration of the combined netarsudil/latanoprost product (versus 5.1% and 2.7% for the 
respective individual netarsudil and latanoprost single constituents). Similar findings for the AE 
instillation site pain were noted in one of the phase III studies PG324-CS302 but not the other (PG324-
CS301). 
Similarly, instillation site erythema occurred in the FDC treatment group at almost twice the frequency 
of the single-constituent group.  
Both instillation site pain and erythema as listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is acceptable. 
Only a small number of patients in the pooled safety population discontinued treatment with the FDC 
due to this local ADR. 
Cornea verticillata (corneal deposits) were reported only in the netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil 
groups, and generally occurred at a higher rate in subjects ≥65 years of age, in males, and in White 
subjects. Cornea verticillata or corneal deposits were a specific finding which are known to be 
predominantly associated with the active substance netarsudil, usually occurring with increasing 
duration of use of netarsudil. In relation to cornea verticillata, previous clinical data from an 
observational study on 45 patients who developed corneal deposits during netarsudil treatment in the 
phase 3 studies submitted as part of the initial MAA for netarsudil 0.02% indicated that the majority of 
cases of cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The presence of corneal 
verticillata did not generally impact on visual acuity.

The applicant has not further evaluated the netarsudil-related ocular AE of cornea verticillata as part of 
this application for the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution. This approach is broadly 
acceptable. However, it is noted that the rate of cornea verticillata was slightly higher in patients 
treated with the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost product when compared to the netarsudil only treatment 
group. 
Long term safety with relating to the development of cornea verticillata with netarsudil will be further 
monitored through the agreed PASS for Rhokiinsa. 
No fatal cases relating to treatment with the FDC were reported during the clinical studies. 
The overall rates of SAEs were low (≤3.2%) in all 3 treatment groups. 
No treatment related ocular or non-ocular SAE were reported for the FDC product.  
The uncertainties in safety profile for the FDC with clinical consequences are reflected in the RMP. 
Overall, discontinuation rates were similar between the FDC and netarsudil groups but significantly 
more subjects discontinued in the netarsudil/latanoprost and the netarsudil groups, compared to the 
latanoprost groups. 
In relation to the use of BAK in the proposed FDC product, (which is also discussed in the Quality 
section/AR), and as outlined in the risk management plan, discussion around the preservative 
component of the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution was raised during the procedure. 
It is acknowledged in the netarsudil RMP that the application of any ocular treatment/eye drop 
containing preservatives may result in possible ocular adverse effects. This risk is considered a well-
established routine risk for many ocular treatments involving preservative-containing eye drops.  The 
preservative content in the single constituent netarsudil ophthalmic solution is 0.015% benzalkonium 
chloride (BAK), which is a lower concentration of preservative than is present in the most widely 
prescribed glaucoma product, latanoprost ophthalmic solution (with 0.02% BAK).  The preservative 
content of netarsudil/latanoprost 0.02%/0.005% ophthalmic solution is 0.02% BAK, which is no higher 
than currently approved latanoprost ophthalmic solution.   
Patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension are usually required to use eye drops for 
life. The presence of a preservative in an ocular medication has often been considered as a potential 
causative factor in damaging the epithelium (Kaur, Lal, Rana, Kakkar, & Singh, 2009). Therefore, a 
preservative in eye drops may increase the risk of both adverse effects on the ocular surface and the 
possibility of allergic reactions. The risk of damage increases with increased frequency of dosing due to 
increased exposure to preservatives. 
Damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium due to use of eye drops containing preservatives 
was therefore proposed in the RMP as an important potential risk. The PRAC further suggested to 
rename the safety concern from “Damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium due to use of eye 
drops containing preservatives” to “Eye irritation, symptoms of dry eyes, disruption of the tear film and 
corneal surface, due to use of eye drops containing preservatives”, in order to further exemplify the 
consequences of the damage. 
The applicant previously sought EMA Scientific Advice in relation to netarsudil mono-component and 
FDC products and questions relating specifically to the BAK concentration were discussed during the SA 
procedures. In this context, the CHMP has previously acknowledged the applicant’s plans to optimise 
preservative concentrations in both netarsudil monotherapy and fixed dose combination (FDC) 
formulations.

Patients with hepatic impairment, renal impairment, cardiovascular impairment, immunocompromised 
patients, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and patients with advanced OAG and OHT were not 
included in the clinical trials for netarsudil/latanoprost. 
The RMP for netarsudil and netarsudil/latanoprost includes use in pregnant and breastfeeding women 
as ‘missing information’ which is considered acceptable.   
The safety of netarsudil or netarsudil/latanoprost in the paediatric population has not been established, 
and the European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
netarsudil or netarsudil/latanoprost in all subsets of the paediatric population for the reduction of 
elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.   
While no impact on the ability to drive or operate machinery due to impairment of mental ability is 
noted, the potential impact on driving especially arising from transient local ocular ADRs is highlighted 
and is generally reflected in section 4.7 of the SmPC and PL. 
The absence of formal DDI studies is reflected in the proposed SmPC of the FDC. The currently 
established warnings for latanoprost regarding the possibility for paradoxical elevations in IOP to occur 
following the concomitant ophthalmic administration of two prostaglandin analogues is reflected in the 
product information. The possible impact of vasodilatory properties of netarsudil is captured in section 
4.2 of the SmPC in terms of specific advice on when to administer other ocular preparations. 
The applicant provided a more comprehensive update to the SmPC based on the currently available 
data relevant to the latanoprost component of the FDC and based on up to date bibliographic data. 
The applicant provided a summary of an in vitro study relating to concomitant thiomersal 
administration with the responses. This study concluded that precipitation occurs with co-
administration of thiomersal containing preparations. The applicant has updated the PI to reflect this 
finding. 
The applicant provided a tabular summary of post-marketing data covering the period 01/04/2019 
until DLP 31/07/2019 for the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost product which has been authorised in the US. 
Over 8,000 prescriptions for the combination netarsudil/latanoprost product were issued. 67 reports of 
adverse events were reported during this period. The majority relate to established local ocular ADRs.  
Further discussion on one case from post-marketing which reported Chemical burns of the eye was not 
available due to lack of further information.  
The Applicant also provided an update on currently available post-marketing data since the DLP in the 
responses. No new safety concerns arise from the limited data presented. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, a higher rate of ocular ADRs was observed with both the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC and the 
netarsudil 0.02% mono-component product in the clinical studies when compared to latanoprost alone. 
Some ocular ADRs were reported more frequently with the FDC versus netarsudil alone but this finding 
was not consistent across all ocular ADRs. 
The ocular ADR arising from corneal deposits or corneal verticillata, occurred only in the netarsudil 
treatment groups, including the mono-component and FDC netarsudil groups, when compared to 
latanoprost only treatment group. 
From the available clinical safety data, it is considered that the overall frequency of ocular ADRs 
occurring with netarsudil/latanoprost FDC was similar to that experienced with netarsudil alone, 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 135/145 
 
 
 
although ocular ADRs in both netarsudil treatment groups were reported at a notably higher frequency 
when compared to latanoprost alone. 
These were generally mild or moderate and often resolved spontaneously. 
It is noted that some ocular ADRs were numerically higher in the FDC group when compared with the 
netarsudil only treatment group. This finding was not consistently observed for the FDC treatment 
group across all local ocular ADRs, and there are no conclusive findings to suggest a possible additive 
effect of the FDC on local ocular tolerability beyond what has been established for the individual 
actives.  
Longer term data on the use of the FDC would be considered helpful in further characterising the 
ocular safety profile for the proposed FDC product, and this is important in the context of the proposed 
indication for the long term treatment of glaucoma. This will be provided through routine PV 
monitoring and it is envisaged that additional insights on the long term safety of the netarsudil 
component will be provided from the parallel PASS for the monocomponent netarsudil product, 
Rhokiinsa, which aims to further evaluate long term safety of this active. 
Systemic ADRs occurred infrequently in the phase 3 studies and at a similar rate between all treatment 
groups. 
The role of BAK in contributing to the overall nature and frequency of ocular ADRs seen in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost treatment group is difficult to quantify but long term effects associated with 
chronic BAK exposure are well known. 
Efforts to capture long term data on the use of the FDC beyond one year are recommended through 
routine monitoring. Of note, there is an observational cohort study planned for Rhokiinsa (netarsudil 
only) product which was approved in the EU in 2019. No further post-authorisation study is planned 
with the FDC netarsudil/latanoprost product as it is agreed that the Rhokiinsa study will further 
investigate the long-term safety of netarsudil use in this population. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the safety of Roclanda has been sufficiently demonstrated.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Given the different indication and the potential for differences in the safety profile given the 
combination of active substances, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for 
Roclanda is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for netarsudil. The applicant did 
request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with that of netasurdil. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the same Data Lock Points. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information

basis of a bridging report making reference to Rhokiinsa. The bridging report submitted by the 
applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Roclanda (netarsudil / latanoprost) is 
included in the additional monitoring list. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Roclanda (a fixed dose combination of netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 
0.005%) is for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with primary 
open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP 
reduction. Both components lower intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour 
but their mechanism of action is different. Netarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor increases trabecular 
outflow and latanoprost, a prostaglandin anologue increases uveoscleral outflow. 
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and can 
eventually lead to blindness due to progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting 
changes in the head of the optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in Europe. It is frequently but 
not always associated with raised intraocular pressure. Not all patients with raised intraocular pressure 
(ocular hypertension) who require IOP lowering therapy have glaucoma.   
Primary open angle glaucoma accounts for approximately 74% of all glaucoma cases worldwide. In 
Europe the population prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma was estimated to be 2% in the 
population aged over 40 years in 2015.   
The objective of current therapy for open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension is to reduce 
intraocular pressure (IOP) with the aim of preserving visual function. The target IOP is determined for 
each individual with the aim of achieving a pressure at which no further damage is likely to occur to 
the eye. Those with evidence of nerve damage or visual field impairment are likely to require a lower 
target IOP. There is evidence that IOP reduction reduces the rate of progression in glaucoma (including 
those with normotensive glaucoma) and the incidence of glaucoma in those with intraocular 
hypertension. 
In many cases patients will require more than one therapy to achieve optimal IOP reduction. In the 
case where more than one IOP lowering therapy is required, fixed dose combinations are 
recommended (to avoid washout of an earlier medication by a later one and to reduce exposure to 
preservatives). In general, it is recommended to use a combination of agents with different modes of 
action (e.g one that reduces production of aqueous humour and another than increases outflow).

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
First line treatment for primary open angle glaucoma is usually topical pharmacological therapy, which 
work either by decreasing aqueous fluid production (e.g. beta blockers, alpha adrenergic agonists), or 
increasing aqueous outflow (e.g. prostaglandins). Prostaglandins are the usual first line therapy to 
treat primary open angle glaucoma. A proportion of patients will fail to respond sufficiently to 
monotherapy and will require an alternative monotherapy or a combination therapy of different drug 
classes to achieve their target IOP. Laser or surgical therapy may be indicated when pharmacological 
therapy has been insufficient. 
A number of fixed dose combination therapies have been authorised in the EU. However, all with the 
exception of Simbriza contain a beta blocker. Beta-blocking ocular agents can be associated with 
systemic side effects and are contraindicated in those with reactive airway disease including bronchial 
asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in the 
following cardiovascular conditions, sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, second or 
third degree atrioventricular block not controlled with pacemaker, overt cardiac failure, and cardiogenic 
shock. As such, there is a need for other IOP lowering combination therapies that do not contain a 
beta-blocker. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted three randomised controlled double blind trials (one phase 2b study and two 
phase 3 studies) with monotherapy with netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% as comparators). 
Both phase 3 studies are regarded as pivotal by the applicant (PG 324-CS301 and PG324-CS302). A 
fourth study, a randomised controlled non-inferiority study with Ganfort (bitamoprost 0.3mg/ml and 
timolol 5mg/ml) as the comparator is ongoing. 
The two phase 3 studies had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to each other but different durations 
(12 months for PG324-CS301, with an optional further 2-month observation period, and 3 months for 
PG324-CS301). However, the primary efficacy endpoint, a comparison of reduction in IOP from 
baseline at nine time points over the course of the study in the combination treatment arm versus the 
netarsudil 0.02% arm and latanoprost 0.005%) was assessed at the same time points for both studies. 
Sample sizes for both studies were adequate (PG324-CS-301, n = 719 and PG324-CS302, n = 750). 
All participants in the phase 3 studies were required to have a diagnosis of OAG or OHT in both eyes 
(OAG in one eye and OHT in the fellow eye was acceptable) and an un-medicated (post-washout) IOP 
>20 mmHg and <36 mmHg in both eyes at 2 qualification visits at 08:00 hour, 2-7 days apart. At the 
second qualification visit, IOP >17 mmHg and <36 mmHg in both eyes at 10:00 and 16:00 hours. Both 
eyes had to have qualified at all qualification visit time points. 
However, a number of participants had no history of prior therapy and may have been newly 
diagnosed patients. In Study PG324-CS301, 25% had no prior therapy and in PG324 CS302, 35% had 
no prior therapy.   
All therapies were administered once in the evening. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Both phase 3 studies showed a statistically significant difference in IOP lowering from baseline at all 9 
time points evaluated, to both netarsudil and latanoprost monotherapy in the randomised population. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 140/145 
 
 
 
In PG324-CS301 reductions in baseline for the combination therapy compared to netarsudil ranged 
from -3.6 to -1.79 mmHg, and for latanoprost from-3.18 to -1.26mmHg.  
In PG324-CS302 reductions from baseline for the combination therapy compared to netarsudil ranged 
from -3.31 to -2.16 mmHg and for latanoprost from -2.01 to -1.47mmHg. In both pivotal studies the 
treatment differences were statistically significant at all timepoints. 
Evidence of maintenance of efficacy over a period of 12 months has been provided in Study PG324-
CS301. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Both phase 3 studies included a wide range of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
However, a number of participants had no history of prior therapy. 
Following CHMP scientific advice the applicant conducted a number of post-hoc sub-group analyses on 
patient populations who participated in the studies and who would be anticipated to require 
combination therapy. Such analyses supported demonstration of efficacy in the target population. 
Despite appropriate methodology and agreement with regulators, the post-hoc nature of such analyses 
adds some uncertainty. 
As completion rates were lower for Roclanda and netarsudil compared to latanoprost, the long-term 
benefits might be overestimated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pooled safety population, the overall number of subjects reporting at least one AE (either ocular 
or non-ocular) was greater in the netarsudil/latanoprost (76.3%) and netarsudil (70.5%) groups, 
compared to the latanoprost (48.6%) group. 
Across the pooled clinical safety studies for the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC, the majority of ADRs (as 
well as ADR-induced discontinuations) reported were ocular in nature. Most AEs were judged as 
treatment-related and the majority (≥ 95%) were assessed as mild or moderate.   
Serious AEs occurred in ≤4.2% of subjects in any treatment group. No treatment-related SAEs 
occurred in safety population. 
The nature and frequency of ocular events reported with the FDC is generally in line with those 
reported for the active substance netarsudil 
The safety profile of latanoprost is well-established. In the netarsudil/latanoprost group, the most 
common ocular AEs included: conjunctival hyperaemia (58.7%), instillation site pain (20.1%), cornea 
verticillata (15.4%), and conjunctival haemorrhage (10.8%). 
The incidence of AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation was low (1.7%) in the Phase II study.   
In the pooled analysis, the rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost (13.7%) and the netarsudil (14.5%) groups, compared to latanoprost group 
(1.6%). The most frequently reported AEs that resulted in test agent discontinuation in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost group were conjunctival hyperaemia (5.0%), followed by eye pruritus (1.5%) 
and instillation site pain (each 1.5%). All other events leading to discontinuation occurred at a rate of ≤
1%. 
Non-ocular ADRs were infrequently reported for netarsudil/latanoprost. The most frequently reported 
non-ocular AEs in the netarsudil/latanoprost treatment group in the pooled population was 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/637805/2020  
Page 141/145 
 
 
 
nasopharyngitis (1.7%), followed by dermatitis contact (1.5%); both AEs were reported at a higher 
rate than in the netarsudil and latanoprost groups. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The pooled safety data provided for the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC ophthalmic solution confirms that 
local tolerability and ocular ADRs are consistently reported at a higher rate in both the netarsudil 
0.02% treatment group and the FDC group, when compared to latanoprost alone. 
A specific ocular ADR which related to cornea deposits or cornea verticillata was observed only in the 
netarsudil treatment groups, for both the mono-component product and the FDC product.  
Data from nonclinical studies for the active substance netarsudil has previously indicated that corneal 
deposits (or verticillata) commonly observed in the clinical studies (in approximately 15%+ patients in 
across the netarsudil treatment groups) were reflected in a similar way in the nonclinical studies. The 
underlying process involved is considered to be due to phospholipiodosis, which is known to occur with 
other authorised medicines, most commonly amiodarone.  
Previously available clinical data from the initial MAA for Rhokiinsa (netarsudil 0.02%) further explored 
the finding of cornea verticillata or deposits in a dedicated observational study on 45 patients who 
developed corneal deposits during netarsudil treatment in the phase 3 studies. 
This study found that the majority of cases of cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of 
treatment with netarsudil. The presence of corneal verticillata did not generally impact on visual acuity. 
While this is approach broadly acceptable, it is noted that there is an absence of longer term data in 
patients treated with the FDC, especially in the context of the proposed indication in glaucoma where 
long term treatment with netarsudil/latanoprost is expected.  
There is some evidence from nonclinical studies with netarsudil that corneal erosion can occur with 
netarsudil treatment. In rabbit ocular studies, degeneration or erosion of the cornea was observed with 
netarsudil concentrations of 0.04% and above (twice daily administration). In one study these effects 
are described as corneal lesions consisting of peripheral vascularisation, mixed cell inflammation, 
attenuation of the overlying corneal epithelium. While findings related to corneal erosion were not 
commonly observed in the clinical studies, a number of sporadic cases of punctate keratitis and 
increased corneal staining were noted in the pooled safety data. Interestingly, cases of punctate 
keratitis were reported at a higher frequency in the netarsudil only group compared to the 
netarsudil/latanoprost FDC group. 
The possible clinical relevance of the nonclinical findings for the active substance netarsudil is unclear 
especially in the context of longer term treatment with FDC product netarsudil/latanoprost.  
The uncertainties on the long-term safety of Roclanda will be reduced through routine PV monitoring 
and with results from the Post-Authorisation Safety Study for Rhokiinsa (netarsudil alone). 
The role of BAK in contributing to the overall nature and frequency of ocular ADRs seen in the 
netarsudil/latanoprost and netarsudil only treatment groups is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, 
further longer term data would be helpful in clarifying the longer term safety profile for the FDC, given 
the potential effects on the cornea known to be associated with chronic exposure to BAK. 
This issue was the subject of previous CHMP SA discussions.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in both Phase 3 studies. At all 9 time points evaluated there a 
statistically significant reduction from baseline in IOP for Roclanda compared to netarsudil and 
latanoprost. Reduction of IOP is a commonly accepted goal in this patient population, as IOP is 
considered predictive of longer-term clinically relevant complication such as optic nerve damage and 
visual field loss. 
Ocular ADRs occurred in a notably higher percentage of patients treated with netarsudil/latanoprost 
and netarsudil 0.02% once daily when compared to latanoprost. Ocular ADRs were frequently mild-
moderate in intensity.  
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was due to ocular ADRs. 
This may have implications for long term compliance with treatment, which is crucial given the target 
indication in glaucoma. Further insights into longer safety of the FDC would be helpful in clarifying the

situation. This will be provided through routine pharmacovigilance monitoring for the FDC product, 
whilst further evaluation of long term safety of the netarsudil component can be explored through the 
previously agreed PASS on the long term safety of the recently approved mono-component product 
Rhokiinsa. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in both Phase 3 studies, both in the overall study population and in the 
population targeted in the indication. At all 9 time points evaluated there a statistically significant 
reduction from baseline in IOP for Roclanda compared to netarsudil and latanoprost.  
The ocular tolerability profile of netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution administered once daily was 
very similar to that established for the active substance netarsudil 0.02%. Adverse events were mostly 
of mild and moderate severity. 
Considering the well-established importance of the reduction in IOP in preventing long-term clinically 
relevant consequences and the frequency and severity of adverse events, it is considered that the 
benefits outweigh the risks in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension 
for whom monotherapy with a prostaglandin or netarsudil provides insufficient IOP reduction. The plan 
to reduce the remaining uncertainties after the approval is satisfactory. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Roclanda is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Roclanda is favourable in the following indication: 
Roclanda  is  indicated  for  the  reduction  of  elevated  intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  in  adult  patients  with 
primary  open-angle  glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension  for  whom  monotherapy  with  a  prostaglandin  or 
netarsudil provides insufficient IOP reduction. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
Not applicable. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable.

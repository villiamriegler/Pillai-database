1.  Introduction 
On 17 June 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (GENA-15) for Nuwiq/Vihuma, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. At that time, a summary study 
report was provided in order to meet the submission deadline of 6 months after study completion. Since the 
final study report was expected for October 2019, it was decided to await the full final study report prior to 
scientific review. As a consequence and in accordance with the EMA submission requirements for Article 46 
paediatric studies, the following issues were raised (RSI, dated 22 Sep 2019):  
1.  The final clinical study report should be submitted (announced for October 2019 by the MAH). 
2.  A critical clinical overview is requested. 
3.  A Listing of all studies of the clinical development program and a statement if the study GENA-15 is 
part of this program should be submitted. 
In response, the MAH submitted the full study report of GENA-15, together with a short clinical overview, on 
25 Oct 2019. In addition, the applicant confirmed that the concerned study (GENA-15) is part of the clinical 
development program of Human-cl rhFVIII and provided the requested line listing of all studies included in 
this program (see Annex). According to the Cover Letter, no regulatory consequences and no amendments to 
be introduced to the Product Information were identified by the MAH. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The current submission includes the full final clinical study report of GENA-15 “Extension Study for Patients 
who Completed GENA-05 (NuProtect) – to Investigate Immunogenicity, Efficacy and Safety of Treatment with 
Human-cl rhFVIII”, together with a Critical Expert Overview. GENA-15 was clinically completed in December 
2018 and a summary report was already provided to the EMA in June 2019. According to the MAH, GENA-15 
serves as supportive study in the clinical development program of Human-cl rhFVIII. A line listing of all non-
clinical and clinical studies conducted as part of this development program is annexed to this report. 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa), currently marketed as Nuwiq and its duplicate Vihuma is a fourth-
generation B-domain-deleted (BDD) recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (rFVIII) without chemical 
modification or protein fusion expressed in genetically modified HEK293F cells. Human-cl rhFVIII was 
approved in Europe in July 2014 for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
in all age groups. This approval was based on data from the GENA clinical trial program, which evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in adult (GENA-01 and GENA-08) and paediatric (GENA-03 study) 
PTPs suffering from severe haemophilia A, supported by data from GENA-09, and its extension study GENA-
04. At the time of approval, three additional paediatric studies were ongoing: 
-  GENA-13: A long-term extension of the paediatric GENA-03 study in PTPs; 
-  GENA-05: A paediatric study in PUPs;

-  GENA-15: A long-term extension of the GENA-05 study in PUPs who transitioned to PTPs during the 
course of GENA-05. 
In the meantime, the final study report of GENA-13 was submitted (Dec 2016) and has been reviewed in May 
2017 within procedure EMEA/H/C002813/P46/005 and in 2018 as part of a Type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/WS1506/G). The PUP study GENA-05 is still ongoing (expected clinical completion during Q1 
2020). Data from a planned interim analysis were submitted to the EMA in 2016. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa) is a B domain-deleted recombinant human blood coagulation factor VIII 
(rhFVIII) concentrate for intravenous use. The protein is expressed in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell 
line derivative (HEK293F) adapted to grow in serum-free culture medium. Human-cl rhFVIII is supplied as 
lyophilised powder with nominal potencies of 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU per vial, to be reconstituted 
with 2.5 mL of water for injection.

The MAH submitted the final study report for the paediatric clinical extension study GENA-15. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
GENA-15: “Extension Study for Patients who Completed GENA-05 (NuProtect) – to Investigate 
Immunogenicity, Efficacy and Safety of Treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII” 
Description 
GENA-15 was a Phase 3b, open-label, uncontrolled, multi-centre study comprising 48 previously treated 
subjects (PTPs) suffering from severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%). GENA-15 was an extension of GENA-05 
(study in PUPs) to further investigate the long-term immunogenicity, tolerability and efficacy of Human-cl 
rhFVIII in patients who transitioned to PTPs (≥100 ED) during the course of GENA-05. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objective of GENA-15 was to collect additional long-term data on the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy 
(in routine and surgical prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeds) of Human-cl rhFVIII in PTPs.

Study design 
The present study, GENA-15, was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, international, multi-centre Phase 
3b study designed to investigate the long-term immunogenicity, tolerability and efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII 
in patients suffering from severe Haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%) who were originally enrolled in GENA-05 as 
previously untreated patients (PUPs). Participation in GENA-15 was offered to all patients who completed 
GENA-05 in accordance with the study protocol, provided that Human-cl rhFVIII was not registered and ready 
for launch in the respective country at that point in time. Hence, participation in GENA-15 enabled patients 
who completed GENA-05 to continue treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII until commercially available. In GENA-
05, PUPs were followed over a period of 100 EDs. Consequently, all patients entering GENA-15 were 
previously treated patients (PTPs) with a history of at least 100 EDs to Human-cl rhFVIII. 
During the course of GENA-15, exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII, its efficacy in the prevention and treatment of 
bleeds, the frequency of break-through bleeds (in case of prophylactic treatment), the product’s efficacy in 
surgical prophylaxis, and its overall safety and tolerability were thoroughly assessed. Safety was monitored 
by recording adverse events (AEs) and measuring laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination. 
Furthermore, in the course of the follow-up visits (scheduled to be performed every 6 months after the 
Screening visit) the product’s immunogenicity was assessed by applying a modified Bethesda assay to detect 
FVIII inhibitors (cut-off ≥ 0.6 BU/mL). 
Patients completed the study by switching to marketed Factor VIII concentrate, the latest 2 years after the 
screening visit. In any event, the general clinical completion date was scheduled as 31-Dec-2018. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 48 PTPs (who completed the PUP study GENA-05) entered GENA-15, received at least one dose of 
Human-cl rhFVIII and were included in the safety database. One patient received only a single dose of 
Human-cl rhFVIII and had no data collected post-treatment. This subject was excluded from the intention-to-
treat (ITT) analysis, leaving a total of 47 ITT patients. 
Treatments 
During the course of GENA-15, prophylactic treatment was recommended, but finally, it was the decision of 
the responsible treating physician whether patients were treated prophylactically or on-demand. 
Prophylactic treatment: 
Patients were to be treated prophylactically with a recommended dose of > 20 IU FVIII/kg body weight (BW). 
The frequency of treatment depended on the patient’s clinical situation. In cases of inadequate response, 
Human-cl rhFVIII administration frequency or dose adjustments could be considered at the Investigator’s 
discretion. 
On-demand treatment: 
In case of any bleed, the patients could be treated on-demand. The dosage and duration of treatment of 
spontaneous or traumatic bleeds depended on the location and the extent of bleeding as well as on the 
clinical situation of the patient. Dosage recommendations were given as follows: 
•  Minor haemorrhage: 20-30 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak level of about 40% to 
60%. Repeat dose every 8-24 hours until BE is resolved. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/371410/2020 
Page 5/19 
  
  
•  Moderate to major haemorrhage: 30-40 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak level of 
about 60% to 80%. Repeat dose every 6-24 hours until BE is resolved. 
•  Major to life-threatening haemorrhage: initial dose of 50-80 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended 
target peak level of 100% to 120%. Repeat dose of >20 IU FVIII/kg BW every 6-12 hours until BE is 
resolved. 
Surgical prophylaxis: 
The dosage and duration of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII depended on the type of surgery and the 
patient’s individual incremental FVIII recovery. Dosage recommendations were given as follows: 
•  Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25-30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 3 hours prior to 
surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat 1 dose every 12-24 hours if 
needed. Trough levels should be maintained at ≥30%. 
•  Major surgeries: >50 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target 
peak level of approximately 100%. Repeat if necessary after 6-12 hours initially and for at least 6 to 
14 days until healing is complete and recurrence to regular prophylactic treatment is possible. Trough 
levels should be maintained at >50%.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 48 patients who completed GENA-05 were enrolled and treated with Human-cl rhFVIII at 15 
investigational centres (in Canada, France, Georgia, India, Moldova, Poland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and 
United States), and included in the safety analysis population. One patient (#15-96-07) received a single 
dose of Human-cl rhFVIII but had no data collected post-treatment. This patient was excluded from the

intention-to-treat population (ITT population), resulting in a total of 47 patients in the ITT population. All 47 
patients of the ITT population received prophylactic treatment and were included in the PROPH population. 
Of the 128 bleeding episodes (BEs) reported during the course of GENA-15, 111 were treated with Human-cl 
rhFVIII and constituted the BLEED population. Of a total of 5 surgeries, 4 were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII 
and constituted the SURG population. 
A total of 7 patients were excluded from the PP population because of major protocol deviations. These were 
either the use of prohibited concomitant medication or deviations from the scheduled prophylactic treatment 
intervals. A total of 4 patients prematurely discontinued the study. Reasons for discontinuation were: Lost to 
follow up (2 cases), a case of product switch to EHL (#15-87-01), and a case of SAE (neuroblastoma in 
patient #15-55-19, which prevented the patient from further keeping the study visit schedule according to 
protocol). 
Baseline data 
The age of enrolled patients ranged from 1.3 to 11.9 years, with a median of 2.8 years. At the time of 
enrolment, a total of 41 PTPs were aged 1-5 years and 7 PTPs were aged 6-12 years. The mean ± SD 
duration of participation in the study (= treatment duration) was 29.4 ± 6.9 months (median: 30.1 months, 
ranging from 9.6 to 53.2 months). The majority of patients were White (36 patients); 9 were Asian, 1 patient 
was American Indian or Alaska Native, and 2 patients had “other” documented as race. The majority of 
patients (33 patients, 71.7%) had F8 gene mutations classed as being of high risk for inhibitor formation. 
Sixteen (33.3%) patients had a family history of haemophilia; 3 of these patients (18.8%) had a family 
history of inhibitors to FVIII. 
Efficacy results 
Prophylactic treatment: 
All patients in GENA-15 received prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII, with the majority of patients 
(>70%) on a 2-time per week prophylactic schedule at their 6-, 12-, and 18 month study visits. Overall, few 
changes in prophylactic schedules occurred, with 98.8% of infusions showing no change in schedule 
compared to previous infusions. The mean (SD) duration of prophylactic treatment was 20.6 (6.5) months 
and the average dose per prophylactic injection was 35.3 (14.0) IU/kg BW. Seventeen of the 48 patients in 
the study (35.4%) had no BEs during the study. Of the 47 patients in the ITT population, 31 (66.0%) 
experienced BEs of any type and 13 (27.7%) experienced spontaneous BEs. 
The overall prophylaxis efficacy assessment at the end of study was ‘excellent’ (monthly rate of spontaneous 
BEs <0.75) in all 47 (100.0%) patients in the ITT population. For spontaneous BEs, the calculated mean ABR 
(based on a negative binomial model) was 0.283 (95% CI: 0.153–0.527). For traumatic BEs, the mean ABR 
was 1.209 (95% CI: 0.739–1.979) and for all types of BEs, the mean ABR was 1.620 (95% CI: 1.086–
2.416). 
Treatment of BEs: 
During the course of GENA-15, 29 patients experienced a total of 128 BEs. Of these, 111 bleeds were treated 
with Human-cl rhFVIII. These were 15 (13.5%) spontaneous, 89 (80.2%) traumatic, 3 (2.7%) post-
operative, and 4 (3.6%) BEs documented as ‘other’. 63 (56.8%) BEs were minor and 48 (43.2%) were 
moderate to major. No major to life-threatening bleeds occurred. BEs were most common in the knee (19

[17.1%]), oral cavity (17 [15.3%]), and leg (13 [11.7%]). ‘Other’ sites of bleeding were mainly BEs 
characterised by multiple sites and accounted for a total of 32 (28.8%) events. Efficacy assessment of 
bleeding episodes was performed at the end of each bleed by the patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
(together with the Investigator in case of on-site treatment) based on a 4-point rating scale. 
Most BEs (78.4%) were resolved with 1 or 2 infusions of Human-cl rhFVIII. The mean (±SD) number of 
infusions per BE was 1.8 (±1.44, range: 1-8), and the mean dose/kg body weight administered per episode 
was 36.8 IU/kg (± 13.55, range: 14.4-94). The majority of BEs were rated as having ‘excellent’ (52.3%) or 
‘good’ (25.2%) treatment efficacy, giving a success rate of 77.5%; treatment efficacy was rated as 
‘moderate’ for 21 (18.9%) BEs (8 of these occurred in Patient #15-55-13) and as ‘none’ for 3 (2.7%) BEs (all 
were traumatic BEs in Patient #15-55-13). 
Surgical prophylaxis: 
During the course of GENA-15, a total of 3 patients underwent 4 surgical procedures. Two of these surgeries 
were minor and 2 were major. The two major procedures (Laser adenoidectomy in patient #15-62-03 and 
religious circumcision in patient # 15-95-03) had an overall efficacy assessment performed jointly by the 
haematologist and surgeon, both rated as having ‘excellent’ efficacy (with a total dose of 175.6 and 184.9 
IU/kg, respectively). The other 2 surgeries (both minor procedures; tooth extractions) could not be assessed 
as only limited data were available due to both procedures having taken place outside the study site. One 
further surgery performed during the course of GENA-15 was not treated with Human-cl rhFVIII and was 
therefore not included in the SURG population. 
Safety results 
The safety population of GENA-15 comprised all 48 patients who received at least one dose of Human-cl 
rhFVIII. Patients had a mean of 179 days of exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII, received a mean of 180 infusions 
and a mean total dose per kg BW of 6,404.5 IU. 
A total of 29 (60.4%) patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). These were observed 
after 122 out of 8,646 total infusions (1.4%) administered during the study. Of the 48 patients in the SAF 
population, 27 (56.3%) experienced mild, 14 (29.2%) moderate, and 3 (6.3%) severe AEs. Most AEs were 
reported only once. The most commonly reported AEs were pyrexia and nasopharyngitis (each reported in 10 
[20.8%] patients), cough (7 [14.6%]), varicella (5 [10.4%]), and anaemia, bronchitis, ear infection, and 
pharyngitis (each reported in 4 [8.3%] patients). Twenty patients (41.7%) in the SAF population experienced 
AEs that were temporally associated (i.e. they occurred within 24 hours of the respective infusion) with a 
total of 52 infusions. No AEs were assessed as possibly/probably related to Human-cl rhFVIII by the 
Investigators. AEs assessed as possibly/probably related to Human-cl rhFVIII by the Sponsor were pyrexia (4 
patients) and headache (1 patient). None of these possibly/probably related AEs were severe and all resolved 
without sequelae. 
There were no deaths reported in GENA-15. A total of 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) were documented in 5 
(10.4%) patients. These were: Pneumonia and varicella in 1 patient, epistaxis and a case reported as 
spontaneous nasal haemorrhage in 1 patient (post-adenoidectomy), gastritis and cellulitis in 1 patient, and a 
case of neuroblastoma and pneumonia (in one patient each). All SAEs were assessed by the Investigators as 
not related to Human-cl rhFVIII. The case of neuroblastoma was the only SAE which led to permanent 
discontinuation from the study.

None of the 48 patients in the study developed a neutralising FVIII inhibitor to Human-cl rhFVIII. No cases of 
thromboembolism or hypersensitivity were reported. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for paediatric studies, the MAH submitted the 
final study report of GENA-15, together with a short Clinical Expert Overview. GENA-15 was conducted as 
supportive study in the clinical development program of Human-cl rhFVIII. Since July 2014, Human-cl rhFVIII 
is authorized in Europe for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A in all age 
groups. The paediatric approval was primarily based on data obtained in the pivotal study GENA-03, which 
were subsequently corroborated by the long-term extension study GENA-13. The aim of GENA-15 was to 
further investigate the long-term immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in paediatric PTPs 
(≥ 100 EDs). Participation in GENA-15 was offered to all patients who completed the PUP study GENA-05, 
provided that Human-cl rhFVIII was not registered and ready for launch in the respective country at that 
point in time. GENA-15 included a total of 48 previously treated children (41 aged < 6 years, 7 aged 6-12 
years; median: 2.8 years, range: 1.3 to 11.9 years) suffering from severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%) and 
investigated Human-cl rhFVIII’s efficacy in routine prophylaxis over an average period of 20.6 months. In 
addition, GENA-15 adds an evaluation of 111 treated bleeds and 2 surgical procedures to the existing clinical 
database of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Overall, efficacy outcomes obtained in GENA-15 appear largely comparable to previously conducted paediatric 
trials (GENA-03, GENA-13, and GENA-05) and support the statement of clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII 
in the treatment of children. A mean total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 1.620 (0.283 for spontaneous 
bleeds) in GENA-15 compares to a value of 2.88 reported in the long-term extension study GENA-13. None of 
the treated patients had a monthly rate of ≥0.75 spontaneous bleeds. The median number of infusions 
administered for the treatment of bleeding episodes was 1 in all four studies with broadly comparable 
proportions of successfully treated events (i.e. 82.4% in GENA-03, 83.0% in GENA-13, 91.7% in GENA-05, 
and 77.5% in GENA-15). The majority of non-successful treatments in GENA-15 were attributed to a notably 
poor response of a single subject (14 bleeds in approx. 2 years with 8 efficacy ratings of ‘moderate’ and 3 of 
‘none’) which turned out to be related to an overall low dosing of Human-cl rhFVIII and comparably long 
dosing intervals exceeding protocol recommendations (i.e. >25 hrs) in the majority of cases. All surgical 
procedures covered by Human-cl rhFVIII in all four studies had an efficacy rating of ‘excellent’ or ‘good’, 
except for one procedure in GENA-05 that had an efficacy rating of ‘moderate’. 
In GENA-15, the mean dose administered per prophylactic infusion (i.e. 35.3 IU/kg) was consistent with the 
average doses used in previous trials in PTPs (e.g. 38.9 IU/kg in the pivotal study GENA-03). Notably, 
compared to previous trials dosing recommendations revealed a substantially greater degree of flexibility in 
GENA-15 (i.e. >20 IU/kg at a not further specified frequency vs. e.g. 30-40 IU/kg every other day or 3-times 
weekly in GENA-13). In line with this more liberal approach to dosing, the overall range of individual doses 
reported in GENA-15 was substantially broader (i.e. 16.6-100.2 IU/kg vs. e.g. 28.5-61.0 IU/kg in GENA-13). 
Furthermore, compared to previous studies, a substantially lower monthly consumption of Human-cl rhFVIII 
was noted (mean: 329.8 IU/kg in GENA-15 vs. 531.2 IU/kg in GENA-13), consistent with a general trend 
towards prolonged treatment intervals (i.e. 68.1% of patients at screening and 84.9% at 18-month on a 
2x/week regimen). 
During the course of GENA-15, Human-cl rhFVIII was generally well tolerated. The overall profile of AEs 
reported in GENA-15 is regarded inconspicuous, consistent with the previously established safety profile of 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/371410/2020 
Page 9/19 
  
  
Human-cl rhFVIII, and does not indicate safety concerns specific to the group of children. Neither review of 
laboratory results, nor of vital signs or physical findings indicates safety concerns related to the 
administration of Human-cl rhFVIII. None of the 48 patients who participated in GENA-15 developed 
neutralising antibodies against Human-cl rhFVIII and there were no reports of thromboembolism or 
hypersensitivity. 
No AEs were assessed as possibly/probably related to Human-cl rhFVIII by the Investigators. The only AEs 
assessed by the sponsor as possibly/probably related to Human-cl rhFVIII were pyrexia (5 events in 4 
patients) and headache (1 event in 1 patient). None of these events was severe, and all resolved without 
sequelae. Both types of AEs are not considered remarkable and are already reflected in section 4.8 of the 
current SmPC. In light of the additional AE reports from GENA-15, the frequencies of pyrexia (common, 
≥1/100 to <1/10) and headache (uncommon, ≥1/1,000 to <1/100) referred to by the current SmPC remain 
unchanged. Similarly, data from GENA-15 do not change the currently reported frequency of FVIII inhibition 
in PTPs (uncommon ≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Consequently, it is concurred with the MAH’s overall conclusion 
that the submitted data do not warrant any update of the Product information.

3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, at this point in time, data obtained in GENA-15 are not expected to change the favourable 
benefit risk profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in pediatric patients. The presented data do not warrant an update of 
the Product information and no regulatory actions are expected to be required. However, prior to a final 
recommendation, additional clarification on some of the reported clinical outcomes (efficacy and safety) 
should be provided by the MAH. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications (see section 4 below).

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following issues as part of this procedure: 
1.  Whereas the average dose of Human-cl rhFVIII administered per prophylactic injection in GENA-15 
was similar to previous trials, the monthly consumption was substantially lower (mean values: 329.8 
IU/kg in GENA-15 vs. 527.7 IU/kg in GENA-03 and 531.2 IU/kg in GENA-13). While these differences 
indicate a general trend towards prolonged dosing intervals, such a trend appears counter-intuitive in 
light of the comparably huge number of younger children (expected to require rather shorter dosing 
intervals and higher doses) included in the trial. Hence, the MAH should critically discuss the monthly 
consumption of Human-cl rhFVIII reported in GENA-15 in the context of previous trials (in 
consideration of the respective age distributions of study participants, the underlying dosing 
regimens, and the reported efficacy outcomes). 
2.  The MAH should critically discuss the notably poor efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in Patient #15-55-13 
who, according to listing 16.2.6.2.1-2, experienced a total of 14 bleeds (in approx. 2 years) with 8 
efficacy ratings of ‘moderate’ and 3 of ‘none’. 
3.  While none of the reported AEs were deemed related to Human-cl rhFVIII by the investigators, the 
sponsor assessed a total of 5 events of pyrexia (in 4 patients) and 1 event of headache as 
possibly/probably related to the IMP. Since no further information on these AEs is given, the MAH 
should provide additional clarification to justify these differing judgements.  
4.  The MAH should critically discuss the, compared to previous trials, high frequency of reported cases 
of potentially drug-related pyrexia and provide additional justification for not considering these as 
potential manifestations of hypersensitivity.

5.  Assessment of the MAH’s responses to the RSI 
Question 1 
Whereas the average dose of Human-cl rhFVIII administered per prophylactic injection in GENA-15 was 
similar to previous trials, the monthly consumption was substantially lower (mean values: 329.8 IU/kg in 
GENA-15 vs. 527.7 IU/kg in GENA-03 and 531.2 IU/kg in GENA-13). While these differences indicate a 
general trend towards prolonged dosing intervals, such a trend appears counter-intuitive in light of the 
comparably huge number of younger children (expected to require rather shorter dosing intervals and higher 
doses) included in the trial. Hence, the MAH should critically discuss the monthly consumption of Human-cl 
rhFVIII reported in GENA-15 in the context of previous trials (in consideration of the respective age 
distributions of study participants, the underlying dosing regimens, and the reported efficacy outcomes). 
MAH’s responses 
A summary of parameters relevant to the discussion are presented in the table below. 
As GENA-03 and GENA-13 were the first studies performed in young children (initiated in Dec 2010 and Oct 
2011, respectively), a conservative approach was taken regarding the recommended prophylactic treatment 
frequency. In the GENA-03 and GENA-13 studies, only every-other-day or a 3-times-a-week dosage regimen 
were allowed. By the time of initiation of the GENA-15 study (Mar 2014), data from other studies (namely 
GENA-03 (final data) and GENA-13 (interim data)) had indicated that Human-cl rhFVIII was efficacious and 
safe when used for prophylactic treatment in younger children. GENA-15 and its parent study GENA-05 
(initiated Mar 2013) allowed greater freedom to the Investigators regarding the choice of prophylactic 
treatment schedule, with the frequency of treatment depending on the patient’s clinical situation; the 
majority of patients in GENA-15 were treated on a 2-time per week schedule at screening (68.1%), 6-months 
(70.5%), 12-months (79.0%) and 18-months (84.9%). Despite the longer treatment intervals in GENA-15, 
the Investigators determined that the patients barely required higher doses of Human-cl rhFVIII based on 
their clinical picture. The observed average bleeding rate (ABR) in GENA-15 was low indicating that the 
chosen prophylactic doses and schedules were appropriate for the patient population in the study. 
A comparison of the GENA-15 efficacy results with those of GENA-03 and GENA-13 should be made with 
caution given the different study populations. A notable decrease in ABR was observed for the younger 
patient group in the extension study GENA-13 when compared with its parent study GENA-03 (0.336 vs. 
1.207), and when comparing GENA-15 with its parent study GENA-05 (0.283 vs. 0.976 [inhibitor-free 
periods]). This may indicate that lower ABRs were observed in the extension studies as the patients were 
already used to receive Human-cl rhFVIII prophylaxis after having successfully completed the parent studies. 
Therefore, comparison of the studies should focus on GENA-15 vs. GENA-13. 
When comparing the ABR for spontaneous BEs, the mean ABR in GENA-15 (0.283) was comparable to that in 
the younger patient group (2–5 years) in GENA-13 (0.336), confirming efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in 
younger previously treated patients (mean monthly consumption in the 2–5 years subgroup in GENA-13 was 
557.3 IU/kg). As the dosing schedule in GENA-13 did not allow the use of lower frequency dosing as in 
GENA-15, with a recommended minimum dose in GENA-13 of 30 IU/kg compared to >20 IU/kg in GENA-15, 
patients would inherently have a higher consumption of Human-cl rhFVIII in GENA-13 compared to 
equivalent patients in GENA-15. In both long-term studies, the majority of patients were indeed well 
controlled under the respective prophylactic treatments, with 54% of patients (2–5 years) in GENA-13 and 
72% of patients in GENA-15 not experiencing any spontaneous bleeding events over the long course of the 
studies. It is therefore likely that the differences in Human-cl rhFVIII consumption are related to the added 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/371410/2020 
Page 12/19 
  
  
flexibility in dosing schedule and dose in GENA-15. Equivalent efficacy was achieved in GENA-15 with a lower 
Human-cl rhFVIII consumption compared to GENA-13; this should be noted as a positive finding for both 
patients and prescribers. It cannot be ruled out that that inherent undetected differences in the patient 
populations included in GENA-15 and GENA-13 also had an impact on the consumption of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
A conservative approach when first treating younger patients is still warranted and the instruction in the 
SmPC that “In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary” is still appropriate. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH justified the compared to previous trials substantially lower monthly consumption of Human-cl 
rhFVIII reported in GENA-15 by a generally more conservative approach to dosing in earlier trials. Indeed, a 
comparison of study protocols reveals a notably greater degree of flexibility in GENA-15 (i.e. >20 IU/kg at a 
not further specified frequency) when compared to the long-term paediatric study GENA-13 (i.e. doses of 30-
40 IU/kg every other day or 3-times weekly). Considering these differences and given the largely excellent 
prophylactic efficacy reported in GENA-15, the lower monthly consumption of Human-cl rhFVIII is considered 
reasonably justified.

Furthermore, it is concurred with the applicant’s view that, given the limitations in comparing data derived 
from different trials and different study populations, a conservative approach when first treating younger 
patients is still warranted and that the statement “In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter 
dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary” included in the product’s SmPC is still appropriate. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved  
Question 2 
The MAH should critically discuss the notably poor efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in Patient #15-55-13 who, 
according to listing 16.2.6.2.1-2, experienced a total of 14 bleeds (in approx. 2 years) with 8 efficacy ratings 
of ‘moderate’ and 3 of ‘none’. 
MAH’s responses 
Patient Description: 
This patient was screened into the preceding study GENA-05 on 30Nov2015 aged 0.9 years (DOB Dec2014), 
with his first exposure to the study medication on the same day. He was continuously treated prophylactically 
with a dose of approximately 34.5 IU/kg BW twice per week. He reported 6 bleeding episodes within a period 
of almost one year (completion date 13Oct2016). Four were categorized “moderate to major”, whereas 2 
were “minor” bleeds. Of these 6 BEs, 4 were spontaneous and 2 were traumatic, with an outcome rated 
“good” in 3 cases, “moderate” in 2 cases, and “none” in one case. The BEs were treated according to protocol 
recommendation, with a dose of 34.64 IU/kg BW on average. Five AEs were reported in the course of GENA-
05, and all were typical for this age group: rhinitis (1), rhinopharyngitis (2), common cold (1) and cough (1) 
- none of these classified as product related or SAE. 
When joining GENA-15 on 13Oct2016 with 103 EDs, the patient was aged 1.8 years. He continued a twice 
weekly prophylactic treatment with an average dose of 32.5 IU/kg BW per ED in accordance with the study 
protocol; in April/May 2017, he switched to three times per week. In the further course, he reported the 
following 5 AEs: stomatitis (1), chronic pulpitis (1), acute periodontitis (1), pharyngotonsillitis (1), and 
chronic periodontitis exacerbation (1) – none classified as product related or SAE. FVIII-antibodies were not 
detected during the course of both studies. 
Discussion of Bleedings in GENA-15: 
In fact, as can be seen from below (Tables 2 and 3), the patient reported 14 bleeds (5 “minor”, and 9 
“moderate to major”), with efficacy rating assessed as ‘good’ in 3 cases, ‘moderate’ in 8 cases, and ‘none’ in 
3 BEs. It should be noted that only one out of these 14 bleeds was spontaneous, whereas 9 were traumatic, 
one was post-operative (tooth extraction), and another 3 were categorized as “other” (dentist’s treatments). 
Overall, the prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII worked well in this patient, with just one 
spontaneous bleeding episode reported during an observational period of more than 1 ½ years. The majority 
having been traumatic bleeding episodes, or were related to dental procedures. The bleeding events were in 
general treated with a relatively low dose as can be seen in Table 2. The protocol allowed more flexibility in 
the treatment of bleeds. As an example, for moderate to major BEs, the recommended dose was 30-40 IU/kg 
BW to achieve an intended target peak level of about 60% to 80%. Effectively, the average dose 
administered to this patient was 33.6 IU/kg BW. In the light of the patient’s long-lasting bleeding episodes, 
dose adjustments in the treatment of ongoing BEs would have been required.

EMA/371410/2020

When further looking into the intervals of treating BEs, the protocol recommends (in addition to the dose 
range as outlined above) to repeat the dose every 6 to 24 hours until the BE is resolved. However, it can be 
seen that in this patient, the repeated dossing within 24 hours for moderate to major bleeds exceeded the 
recommendations: 
Thus, these long intervals between BE treatments might have had a significant impact considering the 
relatively long bleeding times and the comparably low efficacy of these treatments in this patient. 
In summary, however, it should be reiterated that the protocol provided recommendations only, and all 
modifications in terms of dose and frequency were at the discretion of the Investigators throughout the 
study, even though the low dosing in the treatment of BEs as chosen by the Investigator, in addition to the 
long infusion intervals in the treatment of BEs, can be regarded as untypical in patients with such bleeding 
profiles. 
More details can be found on the next tables: 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH provided additional information on Patient #15-55-13 and the bleeding episodes in question. 
According to the MAH’s response, the poor efficacy ratings reported in this patient correlated with a relatively

low on-demand dosing of Human-cl rFVIII (i.e. within the lower range of recommendations as given in the 
study protocol or the product’s SmPC) and comparably long dosing intervals exceeding protocol 
recommendations (i.e. > 25 hrs) in the majority of cases. Importantly, Patient #15-55-13 was not tested 
positive for FVIII-antibodies and his overall AE profile remained unremarkable. None of the AEs reported in 
this subject was classified as product-related or serious in nature. Furthermore, it was noted that during an 
observational period of more than 1.5 years, only one of the bleedings reported in this patient was 
spontaneous. Hence, considering the MAH’s response, it is agreed that the poor on-demand efficacy ratings 
reported for Patient #15-55-13 are reasonably explained by an overall low dosing of Human-cl rFVIII 
combined with unusually long infusions intervals. 
Conclusion 
The MAH provided sound justification for the poor efficacy ratings of Patient #15-55-13. 
Issue resolved 
Question 3 
While none of the reported AEs were deemed related to Human-cl rhFVIII by the investigators, the sponsor 
assessed a total of 5 events of pyrexia (in 4 patients) and 1 event of headache as possibly/probably related 
to the IMP. Since no further information on these AEs is given, the MAH should provide additional clarification 
to justify these differing judgements. 
MAH’s responses 
The assessment of possible relatedness for these specific AEs is based on the fact that the AEs occurred with 
a latency of 0 days to the administration of study drug and no alternative potential cause for the AEs was 
identified (e.g. no other documented concurring medical condition or AE). As both pyrexia and headache 
were listed in the summary of safety profile in the Human-cl rhFVIII Investigator’s Brochure, the assessment 
of “possible relatedness” was considered appropriate and in line with the clinical study protocol. A causal 
relationship between the IMP and an AE carried at least a reasonable possibility given the temporal 
relationship of event onset and study drug administration, i.e., the relationship could not be ruled out. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH does not further elaborate on the apparent discrepancies between the investigator’s and the 
sponsor’s judgments. However, the MAH points out that the sponsor’s assessments were primarily based on 
the absence of an alternative potential cause and a temporal relationship to the administration of Human-cl 
rhFVIII (i.e. latency of <24 h). This approach is in line with the study protocol. Hence, the sponsor’s ratings 
appear reasonable and no open issues remain with regard to their classification. Notably, both of these AEs 
(i.e. pyrexia and headache) are already listed in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the product’s SmPC. 
Conclusion 
The MAH provided appropriate justification for the AE ratings in question. 
Issue resolved 
Question 4 
The MAH should critically discuss the, compared to previous trials, high frequency of reported cases of 
potentially drug-related pyrexia and provide additional justification for not considering these as potential 
manifestations of hypersensitivity. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/371410/2020 
Page 16/19 
  
  
 
 
MAH’s responses 
The four assessments of potentially drug-related pyrexia were made strictly on the basis of their latency; 
there are no further explanations that would help rule out a potential relationship between IMP and AE. 
However, when comparing the frequency of possibly related pyrexia with that of previous studies, it has to be 
kept in mind that the GENA-05 study was performed in PUPs, i.e. very young patients; in this population, 
pyrexia occurs with a higher frequency than in the paediatric population of higher age or in adults with a 
mature immune system. Consequently, it appears appropriate to not classify the occurrence of pyrexia in this 
age group as a hypersensitivity AE, but to classify it as a general disorder. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
In essence, the MAH explains the compared to previous trials higher frequency of potentially drug-related 
pyrexia by the comparably young age of the investigated study population (all pts. were originally enrolled as 
PUPs in GENA-05). In consideration of the very young age of the majority of study participants (median age: 
2.8 years), it is agreed with the MAH that the higher frequency of this AE can be explained by a generally 
higher likelihood of developing pyrexia at this age. Hence, even though potential manifestations of 
hypersensitivity cannot be excluded with certainty, the reported cases of potentially drug-related pyrexia do 
not trigger concerns questioning the overall favourable safety profile of Human-cl rFVIII in the paediatric 
population. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
6.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, data obtained in GENA-15 do not change the favourable benefit risk profile of Human-cl rhFVIII 
in pediatric patients. The MAH provided appropriate response to requests for supplementary information. The 
presented data do not warrant an update of the Product information and no regulatory actions are required.

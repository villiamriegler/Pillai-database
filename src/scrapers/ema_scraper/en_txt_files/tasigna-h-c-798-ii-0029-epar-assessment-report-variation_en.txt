1. Introduction 
Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder which accounts for 15% of 
cases of leukemia in adults and is characterized by a clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells 
which  harbor  a  chromosomal  rearrangement  of  the  long  arms  of  chromosome  9  and  22,  forming 
the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) which is detected in approximately 95% of CML patients (Nowell 
1960, Rowley 1973). This leads to the formation of a novel fusion gene BCR-ABL, which encodes a 
constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase. The presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene product has 
been  shown  to  contribute  to  growth  factor  independence,  increased  proliferation,  genomic 
instability,  suppression  of  apoptosis  and  alteration  of  the  adhesive  properties  of  CML  cells  (Daley 
1990, Kelliher 1990, Hazarika, 2008, Jarkowski, 2008). 
CML consists of three distinct phases: chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis 
(BC)  phase.  The  majority  of  patients  are  diagnosed  in  CP,  and  may  then  progress  to  AP  and 
ultimately  to  the  BC  (Enright  and  McGlave  2000,  Hazarika  et  al  2008).  If  left  untreated,  patients 
diagnosed with CML have a life expectancy of 3-5 years. 
The  management  and  prognosis  of  patients  with  CML-CP  changed  dramatically  in  1998,  with  the 
introduction into clinical trials of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) developed specifically to 
inhibit the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Survival of patients treated with imatinib 
is  substantially  prolonged  relative  to  historical  controls  and  median  overall  survival  has  not  yet 
been  established  (Roy  et  al,  2006,  O'Brien  et  al  2008)  and  imatinib  is  considered  the  current 
standard  of  care  in  the  first  line  setting.  Resistance  and  intolerance  have  however  been  reported 
following treatment with imatinib. 
Nilotinib is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL, a fusion protein created by 
chromosomal rearrangement of the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, forming the Philadelphia 
(Ph)  chromosome.  BCR-ABL  is  a  constitutively  active  tyrosine  kinase  and  drives  the  pathology  of 
chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML),  a  myeloproliferative  disorder  characterized  by  a  clonal 
expansion  of  hematopoietic  stem  cells  expressing  the  BCR-ABL  gene.  Nilotinib  is  a  second-
generation  inhibitor  of  BCR-ABL,  with  a  similar  mechanism  of  action  to  imatinib,  but  with  greater 
binding affinity for wild-type BCR-ABL kinase and improved target selectivity.  
Tasigna was designated as an orphan medicinal product (EU/3/06/375) on 22 May 2006. 
Tasigna  (nilotinib)  200 mg  hard  capsules  was  granted  a  marketing  authorization  in  the  European 
Union  on  19  November  2007.  It  is  currently  indicated,  at  a  recommended  dose  of  400  mg  twice 
daily  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  chronic  phase  and  accelerated  phase  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior 
therapy including imatinib. Efficacy data in patients with CML in blast crisis are not available. 
The purpose of this type II variation application (C.I.6.a) is to seek approval for Tasigna (nilotinib) 
in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) 
chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) at a recommended dose of 300 mg twice 
daily.  
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and the package leaflet have been updated. Annex II has been updated to 
include the updated version of the risk management plan (version 8.1). The Marketing 
Authorisation Holder also took the opportunity to update the product information with the latest 
QRD template. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) of Tasigna has also submitted in parallel an extension 
application for Tasigna 150 mg hard capsules, pursuant to Article 2(a) of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No 1085/2003 and Annex II (point 2 iii) (EMEA/H/C/798/X/0028).

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/60/2009 for the following condition(s):  
  Gastro-intestinal stromal tumour 
on the granting of a product-specific waiver. 
  Chronic myeloid leukaemia 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with a deferral. 
The PIP is not yet completed. 
2. Non-clinical aspects 
2.1 Introduction 
In this application, the MAH provided results of a juvenile developmental study initiated as part of 
the paediatric investigation plan and an updated environmental risk assessment.  
2.2 Toxicology 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The MAH submitted two additional studies: an oral juvenile development dose range-finding study 
in rats and an oral juvenile development study in rats.  
Study no. 0870247: An oral (gavage) juvenile development dose range-study in rats 
The  study  was  conducted  in  juvenile  Wistar  Hannover  rats  for  dose  range-finding  for  the  juvenile 
development study. This study was not conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). 
The  test  article  AMN107  (nilotinib)  was  administered  by  gavage  at  doses  of  6,  20,  60  and 
180 mg/kg/day.  Test  article-related  mortality  and  moribund  state  occurred  at  doses  ≥ 
60 mg/kg/day.  At  180  mg/kg/day,  4  females  and  8  males  were  found  dead  and  2  females  were 
sacrificed  moribund  by  postpartum  day  13  and  the  remaining  animals  in  this  group  were 
terminated on postpartum day 13. At 60 mg/kg/day, 3 females and 7 males were found dead and 
2 females and 1 male were sacrificed moribund by postpartum day 14 and the remaining animals 
in  these  groups  were  terminated  on  that  day.  There  was  no  mortality  at  doses  ≤  20  mg/kg/day. 
Decreased  activity  was  the  only  test  article-related  clinical  sign  and  was  noted  at  doses 
≥ 60 mg/kg/day.  Body  weight  parameters  were  decreased  at  doses  ≥  20  mg/kg/day,  with  mean 
body  weights  at  20  mg/kg/day  reduced  by  approximately  7%  in  both  sexes  compared  to  control 
values at the end of the study. 
3 
 
 
 
 
Study no. 0870248: An oral (gavage) juvenile development study in rats 
The  scope  of  this  GLP  study  was  to  determine  the  potential  adverse  effects  of  AMN017  on  the 
postnatal  development  of  the  rat.  Juvenile  Wistar  Hannover  rats  were  administered  AMN107 
(nilotinib) at doses of 2, 6 and 20/mg/kg/day from the first week post partum through young adult. 
Standard  development  parameters  were  determined  and,  during  recovery,  selected  animals  were 
observed for behavioural parameters and/or fertility assessments.  
No  test  article-related  mortality  and  no  effect  on  clinical  signs  were  noted  in  the  study.  At 
20 mg/kg/day a reduction in body weight parameters and food consumption was noted, which was 
gender unspecific. Dose-related increases in absolute and relative (to body and brain) weights were 
present in both sexes at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in the heart, kidney and spleen. In male pituitary 
and  thyroid  weight  increases  were  present  at  doses  ≥  6  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  test  article-
related effects noted on the developmental landmarks of eye opening or vaginal opening.  
Preputial separation appeared to be slightly delayed in males at ≥ 6 mg/kg/day and  that may be 
related to the decreased body weight noted at that dose level. At the end of the evaluation period 
95 %  (38  out  of  40)  and  92.5%  (37  out  of  40)  males  had  achieved  criteria  at  6  mg/kg/day  and 
20 mg/kg/day respectively compared to 100% (40 out of 40) of control male pups. 
Auditory  startle  response  and  pupillary  response  were  not  affected  by  the  test  article  and  there 
were no test article-related effects noted for mating and fertility, motor activity, M-water maze or 
passive avoidance testing. 
There were no test article-related changes in clinical pathology. 
Slight  to  severe  skin  scabs/ulceration  and  a  constellation  of  associated  skin  microscopic  findings 
were  present  in  all  Pathology  animal  groups  (males  only).  Although  the  incidence  of  skin  lesions 
was increased in the dosed groups, this was not considered test article-related since the underlying 
microscopic lesion in the control animal was of similar type, grade and location (ear or shoulder) as 
the lesions in dosed animals.  
Exposure  to  AMN107  increased  proportionally  with  increasing  dose  for  both  male  and  female, 
juvenile and adult rats over the dose range tested. Exposure to AMN107 was approximately 2- to 
13-  fold  higher  in  juvenile  rats  (Day  7  post  partum)  compared  to  the  exposure  observed  in  adult 
rats (Day 70 post partum). No gender difference was observed for juvenile rats after a single dose 
of AMN107. However, after multiple dosing of AMN107 for 64 days, exposure to AMN107 in female 
adult  rats  was  1.5-  to  4-fold  higher  than  the  exposure  observed  in  male  adult  rats  at  the  dose 
levels  tested.  The  day  70  values  obtained  in  this  study  were  similar  to  the  adult  rat  values  seen 
after repeated dosing in the 26-week study in rats. 
In  conclusion,  exposure  to  AMN107  was  approximately  2-  to  13-  fold  higher  in  juvenile  rats 
(Day 7 post partum) compared to the exposure observed in adult rats (Day 70 post partum). 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted an environmental risk assessment of Tasigna according to the principles of the 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  
Based on data on Daphnia magna, effects on microorganism, sub-chronic effects on fish early life 
stage,  at  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  and  calculation  of  PEC/PNEC  ratios,  it 
can  be  concluded  that  nilotinib  HCl  would  not  represent  a  relevant  risk  to  surface  water  and 
groundwater  microorganisms  (sewage  treatment  plant).  Therefore,  no  specific  risk  precautionary 
and safety measures have been required by CHMP. 
4 
However  algae  toxicity  and  fish  chronic  toxicity  need  to  be  further  characterised.  In  addition,  in 
view  of  the  physico  chemical  characteristics  of  nilotinib,  the  potential  for  bioconcentration  and 
effect studies on the terrestrial compartment should be provided. At the request of CHMP, the MAH 
committed  to  perform  such  studies  as  follow-up  measures  (FUM).  An  overview  of  environmental 
endpoints is presented in the table below:

2.3 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A  juvenile  developmental  study  was  initiated  as  part  of  the  paediatric  investigation  plan.  The 
effects of nilotinib upon gestation, parturition and lactation in rats and the development of the pups 
were shown. All other aspects in the nonclinical program remain unchanged. 
The  selection  of  endpoints  in  the  study  was  appropriate.  Toxicokinetic  data  were  presented,  that 
confirmed appropriate exposure levels in different treatment groups.  
Standard  development  parameters  were  determined  and,  during  recovery,  selected  animals  were 
observed for behavioural parameters. After clarification of open items the study is now considered 
appropriate for determination of permanent functional deficits. 
In a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups were treated with 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg nilotinib via oral gavage 
from post-natal day 7 to 70. Based on a reduction in body weight in both genders and a  delayed 
preputial separation in males (which may be associated with the reduction in weight), the NOAEL 
was stated as 6 mg/kg. An identical NOAEL was established in a 26-week study conducted in adult 
rats.  The  plasma  exposure  level  at  the  NOAEL  was  higher  in  the  juvenile  than  in  the  adult  rats, 
hence  the  juvenile  animals  did  not  exert  increased  sensitivity  to  nilotinib  relative  to  adults.  In 
addition, no new target organs were identified in the juvenile animals. Based on CNS development, 
a post-natal day 7 rat, approximately corresponds to a newborn child. Section 5.3 of the SmPC has 
been updated further to these results. 
No  new  or  unexpected  toxicities  were  noted  in  the  juvenile  rat  as  compared  to  adults  of  this 
species.  There  was  no  apparent  difference  in  exposure  to  AMN107  between  male  and  female 
juvenile rats after single dose. After multiple oral doses, exposure to AMN107 in female adult rats 
was  higher  than  that  in  male  adult  rats  for  all  dose  levels.  In  general,  the  exposure  to  AMN107 
increased proportionally with increasing dose over the dose range tested in both juvenile and adult 
rats. 
Based  on  available  data  nilotinib  would  not  represent  a  relevant  risk  to  surface  water  and 
groundwater  microorganisms  (sewage 
treatment  plant)  at 
the  predicted  environmental 
concentration. Therefore, no specific risk precautionary and safety measures have been required by 
CHMP. However, further characterisation of algae toxicity, fish chronic toxicity and effect studies on 
the terrestrial compartment were requested by CHMP. The MAH has committed to submit as follow-
up measures these environmental studies in an updated ERA. 
2.4 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, no new or unexpected toxicities were noted in the juvenile rat as compared to adults 
of this species.

3.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioavailability 
Study  No.  CAMN107A2127  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  three-period  crossover  study  including 
48 healthy volunteers comparing the bioavailability of nilotinib when administered as intact capsule 
or  the  capsule  content  mixed  with  yogurt  or  applesauce  in  healthy  subjects.  This  study  was 
initiated as part of the paediatric investigation plan. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After  single oral  administration  of  nilotinib  dispersed  in yogurt a  slightly  higher  rate  of  absorption 
was  shown  as  compared  to  a  single  oral  administration  of  nilotinb  as  two  intact  capsules. 
Administration of nilotinib with the capsule contents dispersed in yogurt resulted in 31%, 11% and 
8%  increase  in Cmax,  AUC0-tlast  and  AUC 0-∞  respectively,  showing  bioequivalence  in  terms  of  AUC, 
but not of Cmax.  
On the other hand, single oral administration of 400 mg nilotinib, where the capsule contents were 
dispersed  in  two  teaspoons  of  applesauce,  showed  similar  nearly  identical  extent  and  rate  of 
absorption as compared to the single oral administration of 400 mg nilotinib as two intact capsules; 
thus bioequivalence between these two treatments could be established for both AUC and Cmax.  
Dose-proportionality 
Dose proportionality was assessed as a part of the pivotal study CAMN107A2303 where one of the 
secondary  objectives  was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  nilotinib  at  300  mg  BID  and 
400 mg BID, as well as imatinib 400 mg QD or permitted dose. 
Full PK profiles were obtained for subsets of the patient population (global full-PK group)  and the 
Japanese  population  (Japanese  full-PK  group).  Full  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  nilotinib  were 
obtained from 34 patients, with 19 patients from the global group (9 in the 300 mg BID arm and 
10 in the 400 mg BID arm), and 15 patients from the Japanese group (8 in the 300 mg BID arm 
and  7  in  the  400  mg  BID  arm).  Three  patients  (one  patient  in  the  300  mg  BID  arm  and  two 
patients in the 400 mg BID arm of the global group) were excluded from the statistical summary 
due  to  insufficient  concentration  data  obtained  over  the  required  12-hour  dosing  interval.  The 
pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  nilotinib  in  the  global  and  Japanese  groups  were  compared  in  a 
population  pharmacokinetic  modeling  analysis.  In  addition,  a  population  PK  study  was  performed 
using a sparse sampling technique for all treated study patients, where PK sampling was performed 
at steady state of nilotinib therapy. 
Serum concentrations of nilotinib, imatinib and its metabolite CGP74588 were determined using a 
validated  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC  MS/MS)  assay  with  a  lower  limit 
of quantification of at least 2.50 ng/mL. 
Results of PK parameters are summarised in the table below. 
8 
 
Table 2 – Summary of nilotinib PK parameters by treatment arm (global full-PK group) 
There  was  considerable  overlap  in  the  nilotinib  exposure  (C min,  C max  and  AUC 0-tlast)  between 
300 mg  BID  and  400  mg  BID  arms.  Based  on  the  pooled  data  from  the  two  full-PK  groups,  the 
nilotinib  exposure  was  13.4%  higher  in  the  400  mg  BID  arm  than  in  the  300  mg  BID  arm.  The 
average nilotinib trough and peak concentrations over 12 months were 17.8% and 14.7% higher in 
the 400 mg BID arm than in the 300 mg BID arm.  
The  trough  and  peak  concentrations  of  nilotinib  were  found  to  remain  relatively  stable  over  the  
12-month treatment course in both 300 mg BID and 400 mg BID arms. The inter- and intra-patient 
variability  in  nilotinib  concentrations  was  similar  between  the  two  doses.  The  overall  inter-patient 
variability  was  moderate,  which  is  also  consistent  with  previous  findings  in  patients  with  imatinib 
resistant or intolerant CML. 
Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Relative  bioavailability  was  demonstrated  between  nilotinib  administered  as  intact  capsules  and 
capsule  content  dispersed  in  applesauce  but  not  between  intact  capsules  and  capsule  content 
dispersed in yogurt. Thus some foods influence the bioavailability of nilotinib, which is adequately 
addressed in the Product Information. 
With regard to dose proportionality, no significant difference was noted comparing the two groups 
of nilotinib (300 mg and 400 mg). AUC 0-tlast represented an approximately 13.4% higher exposure 
in the 400 mg BID arm than 300 mg  BID arm, compared to a  33% higher  exposure expected for 
dose  proportionality.  These  results  indicate  a  less  than  proportional  increase  in  nilotinib  exposure 
between  these  two  doses,  which  is  consistent  with  previous  observations  of  a  plateau  in  the 
relationship between nilotinib exposure and dose at ≥400 mg nilotinib dose.

3.3 Clinical efficacy 
3.3.1 Introduction 
An overview of studies contributing to the efficacy and safety data in this submission is provided in 
Table 3.  
The efficacy and safety of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have been evaluated 
in  a  phase  III,  randomized,  open-label  study  comparing  two  different  doses  of  nilotinib  (300 mg 
b.i.d. and 400 mg b.i.d.) with imatinib 400 mg q.d. (Study CAMN107A2303). The MAH did not seek 
scientific advice at the CHMP for the pivotal study of this application.  
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  nilotinib  are  further  supported  by  the  24  month  follow-up  data  of  the 
phase  II  component  of  a  phase  IA/II  study  including  patients  with imatinib-resistant  or  intolerant 
CML-CP (Study CAMN107A2101E2) or CML-AP (Study CAMN107A2101E1). These 24-month follow-
up data were also submitted as post-authorisation commitments (FUM 032 and FUM 033) and the 
product 
information  has  been  updated  accordingly

3.3.2 Dose response study 
No  specific  dose-responses  studies  were  submitted.  The  choice  of  dose  for  the  products 
administered  in  the  pivotal  trial  was  based  on  the  following  considerations.  Imatinib  400 mg  QD 
was selected as the comparator as this was considered by the MAH to be the current standard of 
care.  Dose  escalation  from  400 mg  QD  to  400 mg  BID  of  imatinib  was  allowed  for  patients  with 
suboptimal response and treatment failure.  
The  recommended  dosage  of  nilotinib  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  imatinib-
resistant/intolerant  Ph+  CML-CP  or  CML-AP  is  400 mg  BID.  Therefore,  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  was 
selected as one of the two nilotinib treatment arms.  
The  300 mg  BID  dosing  regimen  was  selected  for  the  second  nilotinib  treatment  arm  based  on 
results of study CAMN107A2101 which showed a positive correlation between nilotinib PK exposure 
and  several  response  parameters,  where  400 mg  QD  (similar  drug  exposure  to  200 mg  BID)  had 
lower  response  than  400 mg  BID,  pointing  to  an  intermediate  dose  level  such  as  300 mg  BID  as 
more  likely  to  produce  a  better  response  than  200 mg  BID  and  possibly  to  result  in  an  improved 
safety profile compared to the 400 mg BID dose. 
A 600 mg QD dose was not considered, as study CAMN107A2101 had shown a plateau in the dose-
exposure  relationship  of  nilotinib  at  doses  ≥ 400 mg  when  administered  QD  under  the  currently 
prescribed  food  condition,  2  h  after  or  1  h  before  food.  This  finding  also  prompted  the  use  of  a 
divided dose regimen (BID) to increase systemic exposure of nilotinib. 
3.3.3 Main study: Study CAMN107A2303 
Methods 
The  pivotal  study  CAMN107A2303  was  a  phase  III  multi-center,  open  label,  randomized  study  to 
assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  nilotinib  versus  imatinib  in  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed 
Ph+  CML-CP.  Two  doses  of  nilotinib,  300 mg  b.i.d.  and  400 mg  b.i.d.  were  compared  to  imatinib 
400 mg q.d. Each nilotinib arm was compared independently to the imatinib arm. 
Study Participants  
The target population was adult patients with cytogenetically confirmed newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-
CP.  Patients  had  to  have  been  within  6  months  of  diagnosis  of  their  disease  and  previously 
untreated for CML, except for hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. In emergent cases where the patient 
required disease management while awaiting study start, commercial imatinib at any dose could be 
prescribed to the patient for up to 2 weeks prior to entering the study if clinically indicated. 
Patients  had  to  meet  all  inclusion  criteria  within  2  weeks  of  randomization  (bone  marrow 
examinations had to be within 42 days) to enter the study. 
11 
 
Treatments 
Patients  received  imatinib  (400 mg  daily)  or  nilotinib  (300 mg  or  400  mg  BID)  on  an  outpatient 
basis.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the rate of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months 
of  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  and  300 mg  BID  with  that  of  imatinib  400 mg  QD  in  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed,  previously  untreated  Ph+  CML-CP.  For  this  12  month  analysis,  the  rate  of  complete 
cytogenetic  response  (CCyR)  by  month  12,  which  is  the  best  CCyR  rate  up  to  month  12,  was 
considered as the main secondary endpoint. 
Other  secondary  objectives  included  the  rates  of  patients  with  %BCR-ABL/ABL  ratio  of  ≤ 0.01% 
and ≤ 0.0032% (referred to as BCR-ABL ratio hereafter), time to and duration of MMR and CCyR, 
event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression to AP/BC and overall 
survival (OS). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  endpoint:  Rate  of  MMR  at  12  months  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  BCR-
ABL/ABL  ratio ≤  0.1%  by  International  Scale,  measured  by  RQ-PCR.  Patients  without  assessment 
at  12  months  were  considered  as  non-responders,  unless  both  9  and  15  months  assessments 
indicated MMR.  
Key secondary endpoint (for 24 month analysis): Rate of Durable MMR at 24 months defined as the 
proportion  of  patients  who  have  MMR  at  both  12  and  24  months  and  no  loss  of  MMR  in  between 
those two time points. 
Main secondary endpoint for 12 months analysis: Rate of Best CCyR by 12 months defined as the 
proportion of patients with CCyR (0% Ph+) at or before 12 months. 
Other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  for  the  12  month  analysis:.  rates  of  BCR-ABL/ABL  ratio 
≤0.01% and ≤0.0032%, time to and duration of MMR, time in MMR, rate of confirmed MMR by 12 
months  time  to  and  duration  of  CCyR,  rate  of  confirmed  CHR  by  3  and  12  months,  event-free 
survival  (EFS),  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  time  to  progression  to  accelerated  phase  or  blast 
crisis (AP/BC), overall survival (OS), all safety data included. 
Sample size 
The two primary comparisons were: nilotinib 400 mg BID vs. imatinib 400 mg QD and nilotinib 300 
mg BID vs. imatinib 400 mg QD (superiority test). To test the null hypothesis that odds ratio was 
equal to 1 vs. not equal to 1 (with odds ratio 1.83 corresponding to a 15% increase from 40% to 
55% in MMR rate) based on the stratified (according to the Sokal risk score into three strata, high 
risk,  intermediate  and  low  risk  groups)  CMH  test  at  a  5%  level  of  significance  and  with  a  90% 
power,  approximately  699 patients  in  total  (233  patients  in  each  treatment  arm)  were  needed. 
After adjusting for a 10% drop-out rate, 257 patients per arm and 771 patients in total needed to 
be  enrolled  to  have  90%  power  to  detect  a  15%  difference  between  nilotinib  400  mg  BID  and 
imatinib 400 mg QD, assuming that the MMR rate of imatinib is 40% and the MMR rate of nilotinib 
is  55%.  With  this  samples  size,  the  study  also  had  a  90%  power  to  detect  a  15%  difference 
between  the  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  and  imatinib  400  mg  QD  arm,  if  the  comparison  between 
nilotinib 400 mg BID and imatinib 400 mg QD arm was significant. 
12 
This sample size was only powered to detect the differences specified above between the nilotinib 
400 mg BID arm and the imatinib arm, and between the nilotinib 300 mg BID arm and the imatinib 
arm,  sequentially,  and  was  not  powered  to  detect  the  difference  between  the  two  nilotinib  arms, 
hence lack of statistical significance does not imply that the nilotinib arms are the same. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by Sokal risk group (low, intermediate, high) at time of diagnosis. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary objective was to compare: (1) MMR rate at 12 months with nilotinib 400 mg BID vs. 
imatinib  400  mg  QD;  (2)  MMR  rate  at  12  months  with  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  vs.  imatinib  400  mg 
QD. The null hypothesis for both the comparisons was that there is no difference in MMR rate at 12 
months between nilotinib and imatinib. The corresponding alternative hypothesis was that the MMR 
rate  at  12 months  is  different  between  nilotinib  and  imatinib.  A  two-sided  stratified  Cochran-
Mantel-Haenzel  (CMH)  test  based  on  the  randomization  stratum  was  used  to  test  the  null 
hypothesis  at  the  significant  level  of  0.05.  To  protect  the  overall  type-one  error,  a  step-down 
testing procedure was applied for the comparisons (1) and (2), i.e. the MMR rate with nilotinib 400 
mg BID vs. imatinib 400 mg QD was compared first; if it is significant at 5% level, the MMR rate 
with  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  vs.  imatinib  400 mg  QD  was  compared.  Otherwise,  none  of  the 
comparisons was significant at 5% level. The MMR rate at 12 months was presented along with the 
95%  confidence  interval  by  randomization  stratum  and  treatment  group.  In  addition,  95% 
confidence  intervals  were  provided  for  the  differences  in  the  MMR  rates  at  12  months  for  each 
pairwise comparison. 
Confidence  intervals  for  all  response  rates  were  provided  by  using  the  Pearson-Clopper  method. 
Confidence  intervals  for  the  differences  in  any  response  rates  between  treatment  groups  were 
provided using the Wald method. 
The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients who were randomized into the study. The per-
protocol set (PPS) consisted of all FAS patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
and did not have any major protocol violations. Patients were analyzed according to the treatment 
to which they were randomized.  
Efficacy  was  analyzed  using  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  included  all  randomized  patients 
according  to  the  treatment  they  were  randomized  to  (intent-to-treat  principle).  Safety  was 
analyzed  for  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  according  to  the 
medication actually received as start of study.  
Per  protocol,  the  MMR  rate  at  12  months  was  first  compared  between  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  and 
imatinib using a Cochran-Manzel Haenszel test (CMH test) stratified by Sokal risk group at 5% level 
of  significance.  Following  the  step-down  procedure  to  protect  against  overall  type-one  error,  the 
MMR rate at 12 months was then compared between nilotinib 300 mg BID and imatinib 400 mg QD 
at 5% level of significance. 
There were two planned interim analyses to  assess the futility of continuing nilotinib 300  mg BID 
arm.  The  first  interim  analysis  was  performed  after  about  20%  of  the  randomized  patients  (150 
patients  in  total,  50  patients  in  each  arm)  have  been  treated  for  6  months.  The  second  interim 
13 
analysis  was  performed  after  about  40%  of  the  randomized  patients  (294  patients  in  total,  98 
patients in each arm) had been treated for 6 months.  
An  independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  was  responsible  for  reviewing  the  planned 
interim analyses results. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 771 patients were originally planned to be randomized 1:1:1 among the nilotinib 300 mg 
BID, nilotinib 400 mg BID, and imatinib 400 mg QD. However, due to the large number of patients 
that  entered  screening  during  the  last  15  days  of  enrolment,  a  total  of  846  patients  were 
randomized (283 patients in the imatinib 400 mg QD, 282 patients in the nilotinib 300 mg BID arm 
and 281 patients in the nilotinib 400 mg BID arm) in 35 countries using 217 sites. Three patients 
randomized to each of the nilotinib treatment arms and 4 patients randomized to the imatinib arm 
did not receive any study drug. 
The number of patients in the full analysis set (FAS) was distributed equally. The per-protocol set 
(PPS) consisted of all FAS patients who received at least one dose of study medication and did not 
have  any  major  protocol  violations.  Patients  were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  to  which 
they  were  randomized.  110 patients  had  at  least  one  major  protocol  violation  but  were  balanced 
between treatment arms. 
As of the data cut-off date of 2 September 2009, a total of 690 patients were still receiving study 
treatment: 224 patients (79.2%) in the imatinib arm, 236 patients (83.7%) in the nilotinib 300 mg 
BID  arm  and  230  patients  (81.9%)  in  the  nilotinib  400  mg  BID  arm.  A  total  of  156  patients  had 
discontinued  study  treatment:  the  highest  discontinuation  rate  was  59  patients  (20.8%)  in  the 
imatinib  arm,  followed  by  51  patients  (18.1%)  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm  and  46  patients 
(16.3%) in the nilotinib 300 mg BID arm.  
Patients  discontinued  most  frequently  due  to  safety-related  reasons.  The  highest  incidence  of 
combined  AEs/abnormal  laboratory  values  leading  to  study  discontinuation  was  observed  in  the 
nilotinib 400 mg BID arm (31 patients, 11.1%), followed by the imatinib arm (24 patients, 8.5%) 
and the nilotinib 300 mg BID arm (19 patients, 6.7%). Two deaths were reported as the primary 
reason  for  discontinuation,  both  in  the  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  arm  (one  patient  died  due  to  small 
intestinal  obstruction,  the  other  committed  suicide).  These  deaths  were  not  considered  causally 
related to study medication by the investigator.

In  the  PPS,  the  MMR  rate  at  12  months  was  24.2%  in  the  imatinib  arm,  44.4%  in  the  nilotinib 
300 mg  BID  arm  and  42.2%  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm.  The  differences  between  the  MMR 
rates in each of the nilotinib arms compared with the imatinib arm were both statistically significant 
at p<0.0001. The result for the PPS was consistent with the results in the FAS. In conclusion the 
primary endpoint, MMR, was met for both doses of nilotinib. 
Secondary endpoints 
  Durable MMR at 24 months 
The results for the key secondary endpoint “durable MMR” at 24 months are not available yet. The 
MAH has committed to submit the results as soon as they are available. 
  Best CCyR by 12 months 
Best CCyR rates by 12 months (main secondary endpoint), includes patients who achieved CCyR at 
or before the 12 month time point as responders, were higher in the nilotinib treatment arms than 
in the imatinib arm (Table 8).

For the PPS, the best CCyR rates were higher in the nilotinib 300 mg BID and nilotinib 400 mg BID 
arms (81.1% and 79.5%, respectively) than in the imatinib arm (65.6%). 
By  6  months,  the  best  CCyR  rates  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  and  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arms 
(63.0%  and  66.7%,  respectively)  were  higher  than  in  the  imatinib  arm  (44.5%)  The  cumulative 
incidence  of  CCyR  over  time  is  graphically  displayed  in  Figure  1.  By  the  cut-off  date,  CCyR  was

achieved by 70.7% of patients in the imatinib arm, 81.6% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg BID 
arm and 80.1% of patients in the nilotinib 400 mg BID arm. 
Figure 1 - Cumulative incidence of CCyR – Study CAMN107A2303 (FAS) 
The result for the PPS of best CCyR at 12 months was consistent with the results in the FAS. 
  Rate of best confirmed MMR by 12 months 
Best confirmed MMR rates by 12 months were 19.8%, 44.3% and 39.5% for the imatinib, nilotinib 
300 mg BID and nilotinib 400 mg BID arms, respectively (p-value < 0.0001 for the comparison of 
each nilotinib arm vs. imatinib). 
  Rate of BCR-ABL/ABL ratio ≤ 0.01% and ≤ 0.0032% at 12 months 
The rate of BCR-ABL/ABL ratios of ≤ 0.01% at 12 months was 3.9% in the imatinib arm, 11.7% in 
the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arm  (p-value=0.0005)  and  8.5%  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm  
(p-value=0.0221). 
The rate of BCR-ABL/ABL ratios of ≤ 0.0032% at 12 months was 0.4% in the imatinib arm, 4.3% 
in  the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arm  (p-value=0.0020)  and  4.6%  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm  
(p-value=0.001). 
Information  as  to  the  frequency,  type  and  time  of  occurrence  of  resistant  BCR/ABL  mutations 
against nilotinib respectively imatinib, in particular of the TKI-multi resistant mutation T315I, was 
very  limited  due  to  the  low  number  of  events.  However,  there  was  no  case  of  T315I  mutation 
observed up to date. 
 
Time to response (MMR, CCyR) 
Median  time  to  first  MMR  for  patients  who  achieved  MMR  was  8.31  months  (range  2.8-17.3 
months)  in  the  imatinib  arm,  compared  to  either  nilotinib  arm  5.72  months  (range  1.9-19.9 
months)  in  the  300 mg  BID  arm  and  5.78  months  (range  2.6-19.7  months)  in  the  400 mg  BID 
arm.  MMR  was  achieved  by  30.4%  of  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm,  57.1%  of  patients  in  the 
nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arm  and  54.4%  of  patients  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm.  Furthermore, 
Kaplan Meier estimates of time to first MMR show the probability of achieving MMR at different time 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
points were higher in both nilotinib arms compared to the imatinib arm (HR=1.5774 and stratified 
log-rank p<0.0001 between nilotinib 400 mg BID and imatinib, HR=2.5665 and stratified log-rank 
p<0.0001 between nilotinib 300 mg BID and imatinib).  
Figure 2 - Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first MMR – Study CAMN107A2303 (FAS) 
There  were  no  differences  in  the  median  time  to  first  CCyR  in  the  three  treatment  groups.  For 
patients  who  achieved  CCyR,  the  median  time  to  first  CCyR  was  5.8  months  (range  4.0  to  17.1 
months),  5.6 months  (range  1.5  to  18.0  months)  and  5.7  months  (range  1.9  to  17.0)  in  the 
imatinib  arm,  the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arm  and  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm  respectively.  CCyR 
was achieved by 70.7%, 81.6% and 80.1% of patients by the cut-off day in the imatinib arm, the 
nilotinib 300 mg BID arm and the nilotinib 400 mg BID arm respectively.  
Figure 3 - Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first CCyR – Study CAMN107A2303 (FAS) 
The  results  of  the  Kaplan-Meier  analyses  of  time  to  first  CCyR  for  all  patients  showed  the 
probability of achieving CCyR at different time points was significantly higher in each nilotinib arm 
compared  to  the  imatinib  arm  (HR=1.2381  and  stratified  log-rank  p<0.0001  between  nilotinib 
400 mg  BID  and  imatinib,  HR=1.5952  and  stratified  log-rank  p<0.0001  between  nilotinib 300 mg 
BID and imatinib).

  Duration of responses (MMR, CCyR): 
Duration  of  MMR:  No  difference  between  treatments  arms  has  been  observed  with  the  current 
duration  of  follow-up.  There  were  only  a  total  of  11/400  events.  Updated  results  on  duration  of 
MMR  every  12 months  will  be  provided  as  a  post  authorisation  commitment.  Mutational  analysis 
will be also regularly updated. 
Duration  of  CCyR:  The  estimated  proportions  of  patients  maintaining  CCyR  for  at  least  6  months 
were  97.9%,  99.3%  and  100%  for  the  imatinib,  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  and  nilotinib  400 mg  BID 
arms, respectively. There were only very few events observed(5/655). Updated results on duration 
of CCyR every 12 months will be provided as a post authorisation commitment.  
 
Time in MMR 
Time in MMR for both responders and non-responders, where for patients who never achieved MMR 
“time  in  MMR”  was  set  to  0  days  (loss  of  MMR  at  day  0),  showed  estimated  rates  of  maintaining 
MMR for 12 months: 29.6%, 53.3%  and 51.9% in imatinib 400 mg QD, nilotinib 300 mg BID and 
nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arms,  respectively.  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time  in  MMR  among  all 
patients  showed  it  is  too  early  to  conclude  about  time  in  MMR,  because  >  80  %  of  the  patients 
were censored (as they were still in MMR). 
  Rate of confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR) by 3 and 12 months 
The rate of confirmed CHR by 12 months was slightly higher in the imatinib arm but the Cochran-
Manzel-Haenszel  test  p-value  for  response  rate  in  each  nilotinib  arm  vs.  the  imatinib  was  non 
significant. The response for best CHR status by months 12 were n = 264, 93.3 % [95% CI:  89.7, 
95.9],  n  =  253,  89.7  %  [95%  CI:    85.6,  93.0]  and  n    =  249,  88.6  %  [95%  CI:  84.3,  92.1]  in 
imatinib 400 mg QD, nilotinib 300 mg BID and nilotinib 400 mg BID arms, respectively. 
Differences  in  response  rate  in  each  nilotinib  arm  vs.  the  imatinib  arm  for  the  rate  of  confirmed 
CHR by 3 months was even smaller and also non significant.

The  patients  who  progressed  to  AP  or  BC  on  treatment  were  11  in  the  imatinib  arm,  2  in  the 
nilotinib  300 mg  BID  arm  and  1  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  arm.  None  of  these  14  patients 
achieved  MMR  during  the  study.  Three  of  the  11  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm  who  progressed  to 
AP/BC achieved CCyR during the study. The log-rank test vs. imatinib was statistically significant, 
p=  0.0095,  for  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  and  also  statistically  significant,  p=  0.0037,  for  nilotinib 
400 mg  BID.  The  estimated  rates  of  patients  free  from  progression  to  AP/BC  at  12  months  were 
96.5%,  99.3%  and  99.6%,  respectively.  When  considering  also  patients  with  clonal  evolution  as 
having  progressed  to  AP/BC,  5  additional  patients  in  the  imatinib  treatment  arm  and  2  additional 
patients in the nilotinib 400 mg BID arm were considered as having progressed to AP/BC by the cut 
off date.

respectively.  The  log-rank  test  vs.  imatinib  was  non  significant  for  both  nilotinib  doses.  The  MAH 
committed to provide yearly updates on overall survival.  
3.3.4 Clinical studies in special populations 
No  studies  in  special  populations  were  submitted.  It  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC  that  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  Tasigna  in  paediatric  patients  from  birth  to  less  then  18  years  have  not  yet  been 
established.  Therefore  its  use  in  paediatric  patients  is  not  recommended  due  to  a  lack  of  data  on 
safety  and  efficacy. Hepatic impairment  is  known from  earlier  studies  to  have  a  modest  effect  on 
the  pharmacokinetics  and  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Since  nilotinib  is  metabolized  and  not  renally 
excreted  total  body  clearance  is  not  anticipated  to  decrease  in  patients  with  renal  impairment 
which is also reflected in the SmPC. 
3.3.5 Supportive studies 
Study CAMN107A2101E2 was a Phase II open-label, non-randomized study conducted to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML-CP.  
Study CAMN107A2101E1 was a Phase II open-label, non-randomized study conducted to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML-AP.  
These were the pivotal studies of the initial marketing authorisation of Tasigna.  
The 24-month follow-up data from these studies were considered as supportive of this application 
and the long term efficacy data are summarised in the table below.

The  patients  in  the  supportive  studies  are  different  from  the  patients  in  the  proposed  indication. 
The  primary  endpoints  are  different  from  another  and  from  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  pivotal 
study. A direct comparability is therefore not possible. However, the supportive studies show that a 
majority  of  patients  maintained  their  responses  at  24  months.  These  data  sets  have  also  been 
submitted  as  post-authorisation  commitments  (FUM  032  and  FUM  033)  and  the  product 
information  has  been  updated  accordingly  in  variation  EMEA/H/C/798/II/0031  (Commission 
Decision on 26 August 2010).  
The Study CSTI571A0106 PCR Report (conducted with imatinib) was included in this submission to 
support the  validity of Major Molecular Response (MMR) at 12 months as a predictive endpoint of 
long term outcome and as the primary efficacy variable in study CAMN107A2303. The use of MMR 
as  a  relevant  surrogate  primary  endpoint  is  based  on  long-term  (84  months)  results  from  the 
pivotal  study  of  Imatinib  (Glivec),  study  CSTI571A0106.  A  scientific  advice  was  provided  in  2005 
for  that  study  CSTI571A0106,  where  the  CHMP  accepted  MMR  at  12  month  as  an  appropriate 
primary endpoint supported by secondary endpoints.  
3.3.6 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  purpose  of  this  submission  is  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indication  and  seek  approval  for 
Tasigna in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive 
(Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP).  
The efficacy and safety of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have been evaluated 
in a phase III, multi-center randomized, open-label study comparing two different doses of nilotinib 
(300 mg  bid  and  400 mg  bid)  with  imatinib  400 mg  qd  (Study  CAMN107A2303).  Patients  were 
randomized  1:1:1  to  nilotinib  300 mg  bid  (282  patients),  nilotinib  400 mg  bid  (281  patients)  or 
imatinib 400 mg qd (283 patients). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  open-label  design  of  the  pivotal  study  is  of  minor  concern  because  the  majority  of  the 
molecular, cytogenetic and haematological endpoints are objectively determined.  
The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  adequate  and  reflected  the  proposed  indication  and  the 
anticipated risks involved in the treatment with nilotinib and imatinib. 
MMR  at  12  months  defined  as  </=  0.1%  BCR/ABL  ratio  measured  by  RQ-PCR  was  chosen  as 
primary endpoint. The use of MMR as a relevant surrogate primary endpoint is based on long-term 
(84 months) results from the pivotal study of Imatinib (Glivec), study CSTI571A0106. A scientific 
advice was provided in 2005 for that study CSTI571A0106, where the CHMP accepted MMR at 12 
month as an appropriate primary endpoint supported by secondary endpoints.  
It is well known that molecular monitoring of CML patients by real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) 
is  of  clinical  value.  However,  there  have  been  some  difficulties  in  standardizing  the  RQ-PCR 
analysis. Progress has been made following proposals for new International Scale for the BCR-ABL 
measurement.  All  analysis  of  BCR/ABL  transcripts  was  made  at  one  single  independent  central 
reference  laboratory.  The  MAH  made  efforts  in  order  to  minimize  the  difficulties  there  are  to 
overcome problems of standardizing the RQ-PCR analysis. 
The secondary endpoints were considered relevant to support the primary endpoint and as part of 
CML response criteria. 
Baseline  characteristics  were  well  balanced  across  the  treatment  arms  and  the  study  population 
reflected the target population of the intended indication. 
For the primary endpoint, the MMR at 12 months rates were as follows: 63/283 patients (22.3%) 
treated  with  imatinib  achieved  MMR,  compared  to  125/282  patients  (44.3%)  in  the  nilotinib 
300 mg  BID  arm  (p<0.0001  vs.  imatinib)  and  120/281  patients  (42.7%)  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg 
BID  arm  (p<0.0001  vs.  imatinib).  These  are  very  promising  results  indicating  substantial  higher 
efficacy for the second generation TKI nilotinib as compared to imatinib. However, longer follow-up 
is needed for conclusive results on risk of progression to AP/BC and on overall survival which will 
be submitted as a post-authorisation commitment. 
The  MMR  rate  reported  with  imatinib  in  this  pivotal  study  appeared  to  be  lower  than  would  have 
been expected based on literature data (Glivec Summary of product Characteristics and Hughes TP, 
NEJM  2003),  where  MMRs  ≥  39%  have  been  reported.  The  molecular  monitoring  in 
CAMN107A2303  followed  the  relatively  new  standardization  of  molecular  monitoring  for  chronic 
myeloid leukemia. Furthermore one central PCR laboratory performed all the analysis. This ensures 
comparable and precise results. If MMR status is only determined for those subjects who achieved 
CCyR (as in study CSTI571A0106 comparing imatinib to IFN + Ara-C), the rate of MMR is expected 
to  be  higher  compared  to  measuring  in  all  patients.  Therefore,  the  MAH  provided  satisfactory 
responses  as  to  the  robustness  of  the  submitted results  and  to  the  reasons  for  any  discrepancies 
seen to previous published data. 
The results for the key secondary endpoint “durable MMR” at 24 months are not available yet. The 
MAH has committed to submit the results as soon as they are available. 
The  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  best  CCyR  rates  by  12  months  were  higher  in  the  nilotinib 
treatment arms compared to the imatinib treatment arm. The differences in the nilotinib best CCyR 
rates were significant when compared to imatinib best CCyR. 
Secondary endpoints for which only statistical significance for nilotinib 400 mg B.I.D treatment arm 
(and  non  significant  for  nilotinib  300  mg  B.I.D  treatment  arm)  was  seen  were  the  long-term 
outcomes  EFS  and  PFS.  The  results  are  immature  (too  few  events)  and  therefore  it  is  difficult  to 
conclude. 
24 
The  results  for  secondary  endpoints  requiring  longer  follow-up  “Duration  of  responses  (MMR, 
CCyR)” and “Time in MMR” are currently not available.  
The  study  was  not  powered  to  detect  a  difference  in  efficacy  between  the  two  doses  of  nilotinib. 
The  dose  of  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  was  selected  as  the  optimal  dose  referring  to  the  SmPC.  The 
nilotinib 300 mg BID treatment arm met the primary endpoint and the same secondary endpoint as 
the  nilotinib  400  mg  B.I.D  treatment  arm  except  for  the  long-term  outcomes  EFS  and  PFS  which 
was  only  met  for  nilotinib  400  mg  B.I.D  treatment  arm.  These  two  long-term  endpoints  are 
considered important. Thus far, there is no indication that efficacy as measured by MMR or CCyR is 
impaired  by  the  lower  dose  of  nilotinib.  However,  the  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  further 
analyses comparing the nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg arms when 24 months data become available 
and to further comment on the proposed dose recommendation at that time.  
Nilotinib as well as dasatinib are known to be effective in patients with Ph+ CML that have relapsed 
after prior use of imatinib. However, the efficacy of treatment when used after refractoriness to or 
relapse  after  nilotinib  is  yet  unknown.  The  MAH  committed  to  make  proposals  to  prospectively 
collect response data (type, magnitude and duration) in patients receiving second line therapy after 
relapse or disease progression with nilotinib. 
3.3.7 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
MMR  at  12  months  for  both  doses  of  nilotinib  was  substantially  higher  than  for  imatinib  and  the 
differences are statistically significant and are considered to be of clinical importance. Support was 
given  from  the  majority  of  secondary  endpoints.  Analyses  of  OS  and  some  other  long  term 
secondary  endpoints  [Duration  of  responses  (MMR,  CCyR),  time  in  MMR]  were  immature  as  very 
few  events  had  happen  and  therefore  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  yet.  On  the  other  hand  no 
detrimental effect on any secondary endpoint was seen when compared to the only approved other 
effective standard medication for the new proposed indication. 
3.4 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In  this  application,  the  safety  data  was  primarily  generated  from  the  pivotal  Phase  III 
study CAMN107A2303  with  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  CML-CP.  Eight  hundred  and  thirty-six 
(836) patients who had at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety population. 
Supportive  safety  data  was  also  provided  with  24 month  follow-up  data  from  two  Phase  II 
treatment arms of a Phase IA/II study consisting of a total of 458 patients with imatinib-resistant 
or  intolerant  CML-CP  (Study CAMN107A2101E2,  n=321)  and  CML-AP  (Study CAMN107A2101E1, 
n= 137) who were treated with nilotinib 400 mg b.i.d. for at least 24 months (unless discontinued).

Approximately  5300  patients  (inclusive  healthy  volunteers,  patients  in  expanded  access  and 
compassionate-use programs) have been exposed to nilotinib in Novartis-sponsored clinical studies 
as  of  31  July  2009  (data  lock  point  of  the  4th  PSUR).  No  unexpected  or  new  safety  concern  was 
identified. 
Adverse events  
A  summary  of  most  frequent  study  drug-related  adverse  events  (AEs)  by  preferred  term  is 
presented  in  Table  14.  Overall,  the  pattern  of  study  drug-related  AEs  were  similar  to  what  was 
observed for all AEs regardless of study drug relationship. Most of the AEs were grade 1-2. 
The most frequently reported study drug-related AEs with higher rates in the nilotinib groups than 
in 
the 
imatinib  group  were 
rash,  ALT 
increase,  headache,  alopecia,  pruritus,  and 
hyperbilirubinemia.  The  most  frequently  reported  study  drug-related  AEs  with  higher  rates  in  the 
imatinib  group  were  nausea,  muscle  spasms,  diarrhoea,  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  vomiting, 
anaemia, and events related to oedema (peripheral, face, eyelid and periorbital oedema).

All of these adverse events related to identified or potential safety issues; significant bleeding, GI 
haemorrhages,  pancreatitis,  rash,  hepatotoxicity,  effusions  and  ischemic  heart  disease  are  known 
from  earlier  indications  (Ph+CML-CP/AP  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy)  and  are 
reflected  in  the  SmPC  for  the  new  proposed  indication.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  safety 
updates of significant bleeding, hepatotoxicity, fluid retention, rash and ischemic heart disease as a 
follow-up measure.  
Prolongation  of  QTc  >  500  ms  was  not  observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  In  the  analysis  of  possible 
symptomatic QT prolongation, it was equal in the three treatment arms and no cases of torsade de 
pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, and seizures were 
found.  The  only  adverse  event  that  could  potentially  be  related  to  QT  interval  prolongation  was 
syncope. Three cases of syncope in each of the nilotinib treatment groups were found. There was 
no evidence that syncope in any of the patients was of cardiac origin.  
The “abnormal QTcF interval values” and “change from baseline in QTcF interval” are higher in the 
nilotinib treatment arms compared to the imatinib arm (QTcF increase from baseline exceeding 60 
ms  was  seen  in  3  subjects,  one  in  the  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  group  and  2  subjects  in  the  nilotinib 
400  mg  BID  group).  Furthermore  nilotinib  400  mg  BID  arm  had  higher  values  compared  to  the 
nilotinib 300 mg BID arm.

It  is  important  to  be  particular  observant  concerning  safety  issues  in  the  first  line  treatment  of 
CML.  Hence  the  precaution  measures  in  the  SmPC  of  QT  prolongation,  interaction  with  other 
medicinal  products  and  the  undesirable  effects  are  endorsed  as  well  as  the  comprehensive  RMP 
described on QT prolongation.  
The  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  safety  updates  of  “symptomatic  QT  prolongation”  (Torsade  de 
pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, syncope, 
convulsion) and QT interval values in the PSURs.

study  were  very  frequently  reported.  The  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  newly  occurring  or 
worsening haematology abnormalities was bigger in the Imatinib treatment arm compared to both 
nilotinib  arms,  both  in  all  grades  and  in  grade  3-4  with  the  exception  of  grade  3-4  decrease  in 
platelet  count.  The  proportion  of  newly  occurring  or  worsening  haematology  abnormalities  when 
comparing the two nilotinib arms are either more frequent in the nilotinib 300 mg BID or in the two 
treatment arms, except for the platelet counts. The haematology abnormalities are described in the 
currently approved indication as well. 
Clinical chemistry: The most frequent newly occurring or worsening biochemistry abnormalities (all 
grades)  in  the  nilotinib  treatment  arms  were:  ALT  increase  (65.9%  /  73.3%),  bilirubin  increased 
(53.4 /  61.7  %),  AST  increased  (40.1  /  48.4%),  hyperglycaemia  (35.8  /  40.8%),  phosphate 
decreased (31.5 /33.9%), lipase increased (24.0 / 28.9%), alkaline phosphatase increased (21.1 / 
27.4 %) and  amylase increased (15.1 /18.4%) in the nilotinib 300 mg BID and nilotinib 400 mg 
BID respectively. 
Most frequent occurring or worsening biochemistry abnormalities in the nilotinib arms compared to 
the  imatinib  arm  were  bilirubin  increased,  hyperglycaemia,  lipase  increased  and  cholesterol 
increased. 
The biochemistry abnormality phosphate decreased, alkaline phosphatase increased, hypocalcemia, 
creatinine increased and hypokalaemia were more frequent in the Imatinib arm. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs  (all  grades)  leading  to  discontinuation  had  the  lowest  frequency    in  the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID 
group (6.8%), followed by the imatinib group (8.9%) and the nilotinib 400 mg BID group (10.8%). 
The  AEs  most  frequently  leading  to  discontinuation  were  thrombocytopenia  (0.7,  1.1,  2.5%), 
neutropenia (1.4, 1.1, 0.7%), hyperbilirubinemia, (0.4, 1.4, 0.7%), ALT increased (1.1, 0.4, 0.4%) 
and platelet count decreased (0.4, 0.4, 0.7%) in the imatinib/nilotinib300 mg BID/ nilotinib 400mg 
BID respectively. Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and platelet count decreased were mainly grade 
3-4.  Hyperbilirubinemia  and  ALT  increased  were  mainly  grade  1-2.  Discontinuations  due  to 
hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia were more frequent with nilotinib than imatinib, whereas 
discontinuations due to ALT increase were more frequent with imatinib. 
The frequency of AEs (all grades) leading to dose interruption or dose reduction was lowest in the 
imatinib  group  (43.9%),  followed  by  the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  group  (50.5%)  and  the  nilotinib 
400 mg BID group (59.9%). The most frequent AEs leading to dose interruption or reduction with 
the  highest  incidence  in  one  of  the  nilotinib  treatment  arms  were  ALAT  increased  (11.5/15.2%), 
thrombocytopenia  (9.0/11.6%)  and  rash  (3.2/6.9%)  in  the  nilotinib300  mg  BID/  nilotinib  400mg 
BID  respectively.  The  corresponding  frequency  for  imatinib  were  ALAT  increased  (3.2%), 
thrombocytopenia (8.9%) and rash (0.7%). The most frequent  AE leading to dose interruption or 
reduction  with  the  highest  incidence  in  one  of  the  nilotinib  treatment  arms  was  neutropenia 
(12.5%) with corresponding frequency for nilotinib 300 / 400 mg BID of 11.8 / 7.6% respectively. 
The  majority  of  thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia  reports  were  grade  3-4  in  all  three  treatment 
groups.

Supportive safety data  
An overview of safety data generated since the last update (data cut-off of 23 September 2006) in 
studies CAMN107A2101E1 and CAMN107A2101E2 has been presented. The safety data generated 
in both studies is considered supportive for the present submission. It includes safety data from a 
total  of  458  patients  with  imatinib  resistant  or  intolerant  CML-CP  or  CML-AP  who  completed  24 
months of treatment or discontinued early (data cut-off of 29 August 2008). 
The  two  study  groups  CML-CP  and  CML-AP  are  not  quite  comparable  with  those  patients  in  the 
pivotal study, submitted for the first line indication because they have been ill for longer time (half 
of  them  > 5  years),  they  have  received  prior  imatinib  and  approximately  90%  received  other 
neoplastic treatment as well. However, the types of the most frequent AEs are consistent with that 
of the pivotal study. 
Concerning  the  QTc  prolongation  absolute  QTcF  >  480  has  increased  from  1.6  %  to  2.2%in  the 
CML-CP  group  and  from  0%  to  2.9%  in  the  CML-AP  group.  The  absolute  QTcF  >  500  ms  has 
increased from 0.9% to 1.2% in the CML-CP group with no cases in the CML-AP group. A total of 
6.2% and 10.2% withdrew their consent in the CML-CP and CML-AP current analysis respectively. 
It has doubled compared to the last update with data cut-off of 23 September 2006.  
Post marketing experience 
Tasigna  is  currently  approved  in  more  than  80  countries  worldwide  and  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Ph+ CML in adult patients resistant or intolerant 
to  at  least  one  prior  therapy  including  imatinib.  The  post-marketing  experience  with  nilotinib  has 
been reviewed on an ongoing basis in the Periodic Safety Update Reports. 
All potential risks (sudden death, ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, drug-induced liver injury, 
photosensitivity,  diabetes  mellitus,  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions,  hyperthyroidism)  and 
identified  risks  (QT  prolongation,  myelosuppression,  severe  hemorrhage,  severe  infections, 
pancreatitis, fluid retention, hypophosphatemia) in the nilotinib Risk Management Plan (RMP) have 
been  reviewed  cumulatively,  and  no  significant  differences  in  the  overall  frequency  or  pattern  of 
these risks have been identified. 
The  safety  profile  of  nilotinib  remains  consistent  with  the  information  provided  in  the  core 
datasheet of the product. There are no new events reported from post-marketing experience which 
have not previously been observed during clinical trials. 
3.4.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  supporting  this  new  indication  in  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed 
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) 
consisted  of  patients  from  the  pivotal  phase  III  study  CAMN107A2303  and  included  836  patients, 
556 of whom received nilotinib treatment.  
Overall the risk profile of imatinib and nilotinib seems to be well known. However, as imatinib is the 
first line standard treatment in CML-CP and was approved some years earlier, the long-term safety 
database  for  imatinib  is  more  substantiated.  Long-term  safety  data  on  nilotinib  from  the  pivotal 
trials  in  the  second  line  treatment  are  available,  which  failed  to  identify  signals  for  previously 
unknown late onset toxicity at the 24 month analysis.

In pivotal study CAMN107A2303, most AEs were grade 1-2. The most frequently reported AE with 
higher  incidence  in  the  nilotinib  300/400  mg  B.I.D  compared  to  the  imatinib  group  were  rash, 
headache and ALAT increase in the nilotinib 300 mg BID and 400 mg BID group respectively. The 
most  frequently  reported  AE  with  higher  incidence  in  the  imatinib  group  compared  to  nilotinib 
300/400 mg BID were nausea, diarrhea, muscle spasms  and vomiting. Furthermore, oedema was 
seen more frequently in the imatinib arm. 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  lowest  in  the  nilotinib  300 mg  BID  group  (12.2%),  followed  by  the 
imatinib  group  (13.6%)  and  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  group  (17.3%).  By  preferred  term,  the 
frequencies of SAEs were comparable across treatment groups. No SAE was experienced by more 
than 5 patients in any treatment group. The number of patients who experienced any study drug-
related  SAE  by  preferred  term  was  small  and  the  frequencies  were  comparable  across  treatment 
groups.  The  most  frequent  SAEs  that  were  experienced  by  at  least  3  patients  in  any  treatment 
group  were  (in  a  decreasing  order  of  frequency)  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  abdominal  pain, 
vomiting and back pain. 
Overall, no concerns are raised when comparing imatinib with nilotinib concerning discontinuations. 
Adverse events leading to dose interruptions or dose reductions were lowest in the imatinib group 
compared to the nilotinib groups.  
The incidences of AEs related to cardiac disorders were low overall, mostly grade 1-2, and slightly 
more  frequent  in  the  nilotinib  groups  than  in  the  imatinib  group.  The  incidence  of  AEs  related  to 
ischemic heart disease was higher in the nilotinib 400 mg BID group (2.5%) than in the two other 
study groups (0.7% each). Approximately half of these AEs in each group  were grade 3-4. These 
AEs were considered study drug-related by the investigator in 1.1% of patients in the nilotinib 400 
mg BID group, and one of these AEs led to discontinuation due to angina pectoris. The frequencies 
of SAEs were in line with those of AEs. 
Although  it  is  noticed  the  “symptomatic  QT  prolongation”  was  equal  in  the  three  treatment-arms 
and no episode of torsade de pointes or sudden death was observed, the “abnormal QTcF interval 
values”  and  “change  from  baseline  in  QTcF  interval”  are  higher  in  the  nilotinib  treatment  arms 
compared to the Imatinib arm. Furthermore nilotinib 400 mg BID arm had higher values compared 
to the nilotinib 300 mg B.I.D arm. In the supporting studies, QTcF increased with time. The clinical 
significance of the “abnormal QTcF interval values” and “change from baseline in QTcF interval” has 
been adequately discussed by the MAH. 
Pancreatitis was reported as an AE for 2 patients in the imatinib group, 3 patients in the nilotinib 
300 mg  BID  group  and  5  patients  in  the  nilotinib  400 mg  BID  group.  All  were  grade  1-2,  and  all 
except  one  were  considered  study  drug-related  by  the  investigator.  One  patient  in  the  imatinib 
group and one patient in the nilotinib 400 mg BID group discontinued the study due to AEs of acute 
pancreatitis suspected to be study drug-related by the investigator. 
Hepatotoxicity AEs were reported more frequently in the nilotinib 400 mg BID group compared to 
other treatment groups. No grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity events were observed in the nilotinib 300 mg 
BID  group.  The  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  AEs  related  to  study  drug  was  higher  in  the  nilotinib 
groups  compared  to  imatinib.  The  majority  of  those  AEs  were  of  grades  1-2,  seldom  led  to  study 
drug discontinuation, and occasionally led to dose interruption or dose reduction.  
Patients with newly occurring or worsening haematology abnormalities in the pivotal study are very 
frequently  reported.  The  percentage  of  patients  experience  newly  occurring  or  worsening 
haematology  abnormalities  is  bigger  in  the  imatinib  treatment  arm  compared  to  both  nilotinib 
arms. 
Most frequent occurring or worsening biochemistry abnormalities in the nilotinib arms compared to 
the  imatinib  arm  were  bilirubin  increased,  hyperglycaemia,  lipase  increased  and  cholesterol 
increased.  The  biochemistry  abnormality  phosphate  decreased,  alkaline  phosphatase  increased, 
31 
hypocalcaemia,  creatinine  increased  and  hypokalaemia  were  more  frequent  in  the  imatinib  arm. 
Except  for  increased  cholesterol  all  the  biochemistry  abnormality  are  known  from  currently 
approved  indication  (Ph+CML-CP/AP  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy),  they  are 
mainly of grade 1-2 and do not raise new concerns. 
Overall  a  total  of  9  (1.1  %)  patients  died  during  the  pivotal  study.  No  more  deaths  occurred  in 
each  nilotinib  treatment  arm  compared  to  the  imatinib  arm.  But  the  three  deaths  which  occurred 
on treatment or within 28 days of discontinuation were all from the nilotinib 300/400 groups (n =2 
/  n = 1).  None  of  these  3  deaths  were  considered  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  No 
special concerns are raised. 
3.4.2 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Nilotinib  is  proposed  for  first  line  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  CML-CP. 
Safety  issues  and  the  risks  linked  are  always  of  concern  especially  in  first  line  treatment  of  a 
disease  where  other  treatment  options  are  available.  The  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  the 
nilotinib  groups  were  rash,  headache  and  ALAT  increase.  In  the  imatinib  group  it  was  nausea, 
diarrhoea,  muscle  spasms  and  vomiting.  Abnormal  QTcF  interval  values  and  QTcF  changes  from 
baseline were found to be higher in the nilotinib groups although no difference in the symptomatic 
QT  prolongation was  seen.  The  clinical  significance has  been  satisfactorily  discussed.  Furthermore 
long  term  safety  data  is  important.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  provide  long  term  safety  data.  In 
conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  nilotinib  did  not  indicate  any  new  or  unexpected  major  safety 
concerns. 
3.4 Risk management plan 
In  this  application,  the  MAH  submitted  an  update  to  the  risk  management  plan  (version  8.1).  No 
new safety concerns have been identified in the clinical trial program supporting the new proposed 
indication,  and  therefore  the  pharmacovigilance  plan  has  not  been  changed.  This  is  endorsed. 
Regarding  risk  minimisation  the  MAH  has  chosen  to  manage  most  of  the  risks  associated  with 
nilotinib  treatment  by  labelling  and  routine  pharmacovigilance.  Additionally,  the  MAH  is  carrying 
out risk minimisation activities in the form of educational material for selected safety concerns. The 
proposed additional risk minimisation activities have not been changed from the last RMP and are 
still adequate. The MAH has also adequately considered how medication errors can be reduced for 
the new proposed indication.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
current risk minimisation activities as described in the conditions or restrictions with regard to the 
safe and effective use of the medicinal product are adequate for the proposed new indication. 
3.5 Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
The efficacy and safety of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have been evaluated 
in a phase III, multi-center randomized, open-label study comparing two different doses of nilotinib 
(300 mg  bid  and  400 mg  bid)  with  imatinib  400 mg  q.d.  (Study  CAMN107A2303).  Patients  were 
randomized  1:1:1  to  nilotinib  300 mg  bid.  (282  patients),  nilotinib  400 mg  bid  (281  patients)  or 
imatinib 400 mg q.d. (283 patients). 
MMR rate at 12 months was doubled in both nilotinib arms in comparison to imatinib. There was no 
difference in MMR rate for the two doses of nilotinib. Consistent superiority was also demonstrated 
for  secondary  endpoints  regarding  cytogenetic  response  (CCyR,  MCyR).  Furthermore,  significantly 
more patients progressed to AP/BC in the imatinib arm (n=11) than in both nilotinib arms (n=3) in 
the 12 month analysis.  
These results indicate higher efficacy for nilotinib compared to imatinib.  The response observed in 
terms  of  MMR  rate  and  secondary  endpoints  is  expected  to  result  in  a  clinically  relevant  effect  in 
terms of relevant long-term clinical endpoints. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Overall  7-year  survival  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  CML  treated  with  imatinib  is  now  86%, 
therefore  MMR  is  the  only  realistic  primary  endpoint.  For  patients  achieving  MMR  the  7-year 
survival is close to 92% and the freedom from progression to AP/BC rate at 7-years is above 95%. 
Therefore,  the  long-term  efficacy  of  nilotinib  as  compared  to  imatinib  cannot  be  reliably  assessed 
for many years. However, OS needs to be provided post approval on a yearly basis. 
Another uncertainty is whether the selected first-line dose of nilotinib 300 mg BID may be inferior 
in terms of long-term efficacy as compared to the currently approved second-line dose of 400 mg 
BID. Thus far, there is no indication that efficacy as measured by MMR or CCyR is impaired by the 
lower  dose  of  nilotinib.  However,  the  dose  issue  needs  to  be  revisited  when  24  months  data 
become available.

Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
The  observed  safety  profile  for  imatinib  and  nilotinib  in  the  pivotal  study  was  consistent  with  the 
known  safety  profile  for  both  compounds.  There  were  no  new  or  unexpected  major  findings.  The 
risk  profiles  of  nilotinib  and  imatinib  differ  but  are  overall  well  known  and,  with  exception  of  a 
significant trend for hyperlipidemia in particular hypercholesterinemia, no new safety signals were 
observed  in  the  pivotal  trial.  Overall,  nilotinib’s  hepatotoxicity  and  QT  prolongation  are  the  most 
important  risk  but  seemed  to  be  manageable  provided  the  contraindications  and  warnings  are 
followed.  In  conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  nilotinib  300  mg  b.i.d.  is  different  to  but  not  worse 
than that of imatinib and is acceptable in the intended indication. It appears more favourable than 
for nilotinib 400 mg b.i.d. 
The MAH is however asked to provide further discussion on the dose recommendation and also to 
commit to provide long term safety data on key safety issues. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Currently only 12 months safety data are available. However, data for the key secondary endpoint 
will be available after 24 months. This will be submitted in the first quarter of 2011 as committed 
by the MAH. 
Data  on  the  frequency,  types  and  time  course  of  development  of  nilotinib  resistant  BCR/ABL 
mutations, in particular of the TKI- multiresistant mutation T315I may be helpful, however are very 
limited. At least it could be concluded that at the time being no single case of T315I mutation was 
identified.  
Nilotinib  as well  as  dasatinib  are  known  to  be  effective  in  patients  with  BCR-ABL+  CML  that  have 
relapsed  after  prior  use  of  imatinib.  However,  the  efficacy  of  treatment  when  used  after 
refractoriness to or relapse after nilotinib is yet unknown. The MAH committed to make proposals 
to prospectively collect response data (type, magnitude and duration) in patients receiving second 
line therapy after relapse or disease progression with nilotinib. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The higher MMR and CCyR at 12 months achieved with nilotinib as compared to imatinib for first-
line  use  establishes  the  efficacy  of  nilotinib  in  this  indication  but  longer  follow-up  is  needed  for 
conclusive results on the rate of progression to AC/BC and on overall survival. 
The observed safety profile for nilotinib in the pivotal study was consistent with the known safety 
profile. There are so far no indications that nilotinib has any detrimental effects on OS as compared 
to imatinib. The safety was better for nilotinib 300 mg BID as compared to the currently approved 
dose of 400 mg BID. A small difference in QT prolonging effect in favour of imatinib needs careful 
monitoring including regular OS updates. 
In  conclusion,  in  view  of  the  convincing  efficacy  data  and  no  major  concerns  in  terms  of  clinical 
safety, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive.

3.5.1 Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Exhaustive clinical trial data were submitted to establish the efficacy of nilotinib based on 12 month 
data  on  MMR  and  other  secondary  endpoints.  Although  long-term  data  are  lacking,  the  level  of 
evidence presented is sufficient to expect that the effects observed at 12 months should result in a 
clinically relevant effect in terms of relevant long-term clinical endpoints. 
The data submitted provide adequate reassurance for the efficacious and safe use of nilotinib in the 
first line treatment of chronic CML. It is considered acceptable that long-term data is submitted as 
a post-authorisation commitment.  
In  conclusion,  in  view  of  the  convincing  efficacy  data  and  no  major  concerns  in  terms  of  clinical 
safety, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive.   
3.6 Orphan medicinal products 
3.6.1 imilarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Tasigna is not similar to Sprycel but similar to Glivec within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 (See appendix 1). 
3.6.2 Market exclusivity 
The holder of the marketing authorisation for Glivec has given his consent to the MAH.  
3.7 Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Tasigna in the treatment of of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic 
phase was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of this extension of indication. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Tasigna 
to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Glivec for the 
same therapeutic indication. 
However, the holder of the marketing authorisation for Glivec has given his consent to the MAH.  
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  takes  note  that  the  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  is  not  fully 
completed. Only some of the measures have been completed as some of the studies are deferred. 
The  CHMP  reviewed  the  already  available  data  of  studies  subject  to  this  plan  and  the  results  of 
these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, 
the Package Leaflet. 
User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet  (PL)  has  been  submitted  by  the  MAH  and  has  been  found  acceptable  for  the  following 
reasons: no significant changes are made to the PL.
